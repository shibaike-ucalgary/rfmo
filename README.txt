Process

1. convert pdfs to txt files
2. manually remove attachments and index from txt (top and bottom of the file)
3. parse each file by number (cleaning.py)
4. some numbers are not properly ordered, manually reorder them on txt file
5. when not numbered (image or nonexistent), use \n\n as parsing (cleaning_linebreak.py)
