Report of the Sixth Annual Meeting 
First Part 
29, 30 November 1999 
Canberra, Australia 
 
 
Agenda Item 1: Opening of Meeting 
 
1.1 Welcoming Address 
 
1. 
The Chair, Mr Peter Yuile of Australia opened the meeting and welcomed member 
delegations from Japan, Australia and New Zealand and observers from the Republic of 
Korea, the Republic of South Africa, Taiwan and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission.   
The Chair noted that Messrs Hurry and Hausknecht were representing CCAMLR. 
 
1.2 Adoption of the Agenda 
1.3 Meeting Arrangements 
 
2. 
The agreed agenda and list of participants are at Attachments A and B 
respectively. 
 
3. 
The Chair noted that consideration of the items on the agenda provided an 
opportunity to progress important aspects of the Commission's operation and sought 
members' cooperation in reaching agreement on the priority items. 
 
4. 
It was agreed that following the opening of the meeting, the first items to be 
considered would be Item 6, Report from the Management Strategy Workshop, Item 7, 
Peer Review of the Scientific Assessment Process and Item 5, Finalisation and Adoption 
of the Trade Information Scheme. 
 
5. 
The Chair invited the observers to make comments on particular issues as they 
arose during the agenda. 
 
1.4 Opening Statements 
 
6. 
Opening statements by Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Korea, South Africa and 
Taiwan are at Attachments C, D, E, F, G and H. 
 
Agenda Item 3: Report from the Financial and Administration Committee 
 
3.1 Revision of the 1999 Budget 
 
7. 
The Commission endorsed the revised budget for 1999 at Attachment I. 
 
3.2 Adoption of the 2000 Budget 
 
8. 
It was noted that the proposed budget for 2000 was based on a program of work 
similar to that undertaken in recent years. 
 
2 
 
9. 
As a work program for 2000 needs to be finalised, including additional meetings 
involving independent scientists to assist in stock assessment, it was agreed that the 
budget as proposed (See Attachment J) be adopted as an interim measure and be 
reviewed at the next Commission meeting following agreement on the details of the 
future work program. 
 
10. It was agreed that simultaneous interpretation be adopted for the next Commission 
meeting and necessary budget variations be considered at the next Commission 
meeting. 
 
3.3 Amendment of the Financial Regulations 
 
11. It was agreed that the Financial Regulations be amended as set out in Attachment K. 
 
Agenda Item 4: Relationship with Non-Members 
 
12. The Chair commented that there had been a long period of discussions on this item.  
He gave a brief outline to the Plenary regarding the outcome of the previous day's 
meetings with delegations from Korea and Taiwan. He reported that both delegations 
had expressed a desire for cooperation with the Commission and early accession to the 
Convention. He reminded the Parties that at negotiations on 27-29 September 1999 
pursuant to the ITLOS order they agreed it was of the utmost importance that 
non-member countries should cooperate with and/or join the Commission. 
 
13. Members stated that in relation to the non-party issue, Commission members had 
been working over the last three years to facilitate the cooperation of non-parties with 
the Commission. Further, all Parties had worked both through the Commission and 
bilaterally in seeking non-parties' accession to the Convention or cooperation with the 
Commission. The Commission had been engaged in earnest negotiations with those 
countries since 1998. 
 
14. The Parties agreed that there was a need for the Commission to keep moving 
forward with negotiations so that non-parties could cooperate with and/or join the 
Commission as soon as practical. All Parties agreed that the increasing catch by 
non-members was a cause for concern as parties have seen an erosion of the work done 
by the Commission for the conservation and optimum utilisation of the SBT stock. 
There was an exchange of views on this issue between Japan, Korea and Taiwan. 
 
15. Japan specifically called attention to the rapid increase of catch by Korea from 
119mt in 1994 to over 2000mt in 1998. Korea had in 1998 expressed its acceptance of 
an allocation of 1000mt. Japan stated that Korea's insistence on a significant increase in 
allocation over 1000mt to meet its increased catch was completely unreasonable as 
Japan had decreased its level of allocation by over 70% during the late 1980's and 
maintained that low level of allocation for the past ten years to secure the recovery of 
SBT stock. Japan also urged Taiwan to consider seriously the proposed formula for 
cooperation. Korea and Taiwan reiterated their views and positions similar to that  
contained in their opening statements. 
 
3 
 
16. Japan stated that there was a need to consider trade related measures and tabled a 
draft action plan for consideration by the Parties (Attachment L). Japan outlined that 
this action plan was based on the ICCAT model for bluefin and swordfish, which had 
already been adopted and implemented. 
 
17. Australia and New Zealand indicated that the draft action plan proposed by Japan 
contained some useful concepts and that they would consider it further and respond to 
Japan before the resumption of CCSBT6. 
 
Agenda Item 5: Finalisation and Adoption of the Trade Information Scheme 
 
18. The Commission adopted the Trade Information Scheme (TIS) as set out in 
Attachment M with implementation by 1 June 2000. Parties recognised that several 
technical issues surrounding data management (as summarized in Japan's paper 
(CCSBT/9911/20)) would need to be resolved before June 2000 implementation and 
undertook to resolve those issues intersessionally. It was agreed the Secretariat would 
notify non-members of the adoption of the TIS. 
 
19. Japan also informed the meeting that it would voluntarily apply the arrangement in 
Attachment N for collecting information from joint venture vessels. 
 
20. Australia raised the issue of whether the landing in Japan of SBT caught by 
Japanese fishing fleets would be subject to the TIS but was prepared to leave this as an 
issue to be resolved prior to implementation. Japan stated if SBT caught by Japanese 
vessels were to be exported to other states, Japan naturally would follow the TIS.  
However, SBT landed and consumed in Japan is not categorized as trade and therefore 
not subject to the TIS. New Zealand also considered that this was an issue for further 
discussion but reiterated that New Zealand's position regarding the WTO consistency of 
the TIS remained that domestic catch must be subject to substantially equivalent 
reporting requirements. 
 
21. Taiwan expressed its willingness to cooperate with the TIS but expressed concern 
that it would not be able to meet the June 2000 implementation timeframe. It suggested 
an implementation date of early 2001. Taiwan's concern was noted; however, Parties 
retained the implementation date of June 2000. Korea indicated its willingness to 
cooperate with the TIS. 
 
Agenda Item 6: Report from the Management Strategy Workshop 
 
22. Australia presented a report from the Workshop, advising that following the 
presentation on the principles for the development of a management strategy by Dr 
Tony Smith from CSIRO, Hobart, an Australian internal draft paper setting out its initial 
thoughts on development of management strategy was discussed. The eastern Australian 
gemfish fishery was cited as one working example, including the actions taken to close 
the fishery due to recruitment collapse, the subsequent reopening of the fishery and the 
consultation process between industry, scientists and managers for the development of a 
management strategy. The Workshop noted that the issues related to the development of 
 
4 
a management strategy were complex. The development of a management strategy for 
SBT would require further detailed consideration, including further workshops, and the 
assistance of external experts, including the Advisory Panel, independent chairs (see the 
next agenda item) and socio-economists. 
 
23. Timing for a further workshop was discussed. Japan proposed that CCSBT 6(2) 
should give guidance on what the workshop should consider. It was proposed that the 
timing for the workshop be considered in the context of the Commission's work 
program for 2000. 
 
24. Japan expressed its position that the workshop should review on-going discussions 
on related matters in other international/regional organizations, and should take full 
account of the aspect of "optimum utilization" as well as "conservation", when 
considering the management measures. Australia and New Zealand noted Japan's 
position. 
 
Agenda Item 7: Peer Review of the Scientific Assessment Process 
 
25. Australia reported the results of the Peer Review Workshop advising that it had 
been a constructive and open exchange of views and that agreement had been reached 
on four matters: 
 
1. 
Procedural Arrangements and Terms of Reference for the Advisory Panel to 
Scientific Process of CCSBT 
 
2. 
Qualification for Independent Chairs and for the Advisory Panel  
 
3. 
Selection of Chairs for SAG/SC and Advisory Panel 
 
4. 
Duties of the Chairs of SC/SAG 
 
26. The Commission endorsed the outcomes on these four matters. Details are set out 
in Attachment O. 
 
27. Australia advised that the Workshop had not completed its work including 
finalisation of its report and that it should be resumed at a meeting just prior to the next 
Commission meeting. 
 
28. The main items outstanding were 
 
1. 
The extent of the Secretariat's role in data exchange and management 
 
2. 
Timetable for the exchange of documents and data for the scientific 
assessment 
 
3. 
Finalisation of the content of any fishery data base to be developed and 
maintained by the Secretariat, noting that the Secretariat had been requested to 
update by mid January 2000 information on the details of the data bases 
 
5 
managed by other international tuna commissions and the costs of operating 
those data bases. 
 
29. The Workshop had recommended that the Commission hold a Stock Assessment 
Process Workshop early in 2000 in conjunction with the Management Strategy 
Workshop. Japan offered to host the Workshop. Japan also stated that it was pleased 
with the agreement at the Workshop that the Secretariat would play a role in data 
exchange and management, which would enhance the effectiveness of the Commission. 
 
Agenda Item 8: Relationship with Other Organisations 
 
30. The Commission agreed that the Executive Secretary would represent it as an 
observer at the 4th Session of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, to be held in Kyoto 
in December 1999, and any presentation by him at the meeting should be cleared by 
Members. 
 
Agenda Item 10: Total Allowable Catch 
 
31. Japan proposed that the Commission, as a responsible regional organisation, should 
first set a global TAC to take account of the global take of SBT by members and 
non-members. It suggested that the level of TAC should be composed of the current 
11,750 tonnes plus an additional 3,000 tonnes plus a figure for non-member catch, 
based on the latest stock assessment, which in its view, showed that current parental 
biomass was not at historically low levels and was in the process of recovering. Japan 
also stressed that it was against the spirit and provisions of the Convention if quota 
allocated to non-members was allocated arbitrarily without deciding the global TAC. 
Japan further proposed that the Commission should consider taking measures to restrict 
the catch of SBT on the spawning grounds and the catch of juvenile fish and indicated it 
would provide proposals to the Commission at the resumed meeting. Japan also 
indicated its serious concern over allegations of the discarding of SBT by Australian 
fishers in the East Coast waters of Australia and asked for information, especially on 
how this discarded catch was treated under the quota management in Australia. 
 
32. Australia considered that since there had been no stock assessment since 1998, 
there was no scientific basis for an increase in the TAC. Australia said it had made its 
position clear on juvenile fish at CCSBT5(1). 
 
33. Australia stated that it neither encouraged nor supported illegal or irresponsible 
fishing and was fully prepared to prosecute offenders given sufficient evidence.  
Pointing out the economic motives of those making the allegations, Australia further 
stated that there had always been some SBT taken on the East Coast of Australia and 
that Australian quota remained available to cover these. 
 
34. Japan provided a fascimile copy of press clippings on which the allegation was  
based and requested Australia's further detailed explanation on this matter, especially 
whether and how discard was counted against the Australian quota. Australia said it 
would provide further information as necessary. 
 
 
6 
35. New Zealand advocated urgent steps to improve the probability of rebuild, noting 
that all members agreed that parental biomass was at historically low levels. New 
Zealand also drew attention to the recommendation made by six judges of the 
International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) that a reduction in the catch of all 
those involved in the fishery in the immediate short term would assist the stock to 
recover over the medium to long term. New Zealand stated that the judges also noted 
that Article 64 of UNCLOS lays down a duty to co-operate to that end. 
 
36. Australia and New Zealand noted that as there was no agreement among the 
members on a TAC, all members were obliged by the order of ITLOS to restrict their 
catch to the last agreed level of allocation. Hence, in Australia/New Zealand's view, 
there was no arbitrariness in making interim allocations to new members pending their 
inclusion in an agreed TAC. 
 
37. Japan noted its disappointment that the matter of TAC was not fully and seriously 
discussed among Parties. 
 
Agenda Item 11: Experimental Fishing 
 
38. Japan noted that it would present the results of its 1999 experimental fishing 
programme (EFP) to the Commission when analysis of these had been finalised and 
stated that, if the Commission were unable to agree to a reasonable TAC, it would be 
necessary to continue EFP in year 2000 to solve urgently the uncertainties in CPUE 
interpretations. Japan indicated that it wished to begin an EFP as early as May 2000 and 
proposed to establish a working group to seek agreement for joint conduct of a future 
EFP. Japan also presented a paper which showed Japan's efforts on scientific research on 
SBT, from long-term to short-tem basis, to improve scientific knowledge necessary for 
better scientific management of SBT stock, and stated that the EFP had been proposed 
and conducted for the same purpose (Attachment P). 
 
39. Australia agreed that there were areas in the SBT fisheries for which better 
information was needed. It stated it would discuss, on a long-term strategic basis, a 
good scientific research program that led to better science in the Commission; that was 
one of the reasons why Australia had agreed to attach external scientists to the Parties.  
It did not wish to again bog down the work of the Commission in EFP where - in 
Australia's opinion - almost all of the fishing effort concentrated on known fishing 
grounds. There are areas of research such as on the spawning grounds (in conjunction 
with Indonesia) that would be valuable. Australia also indicated that it would forward a 
paper outlining some initial proposals which could be included in a scientific research 
program to the other members and non-members within the following weeks. 
 
40. New Zealand stated it remained committed to working cooperatively on the basis 
of sound science to remedy the uncertainties in the understanding of the fishery. New 
Zealand further suggested that the Commission consider this issue in the context of 
ongoing efforts to improve its scientific processes rather than revisiting unproductive 
approaches. 
 
41. Japan stated it shared the view with Australia that the long-term benefit of 
 
7 
improvement of scientific information is important. However, Japan stressed the 
importance to resolve the current outstanding issues including CPUE interpretations and 
TAC urgently. Japan noted its disappointment that Australia and New Zealand declined 
to schedule discussions concerning joint EFP notwithstanding paragraphs of the ITLOS 
order. 
 
Agenda Item 17: Program of Work 
 
42. It was agreed that this item would be discussed among Parties inter-sessionally. 
 
Agenda Item 18: Appointment of the Executive Secretary  
 
43. It was agreed that this item would be discussed among Parties inter-sessionally. 
 
Agenda Item 20: Close of the Meeting  
 
44. Parties agreed to resume the 6th Annual Meeting of the Commission in early 2000.

Opening Statement by Japan at the Sixth Annual Meeting of CCSBT 
November 1999, Canberra 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, Representatives of Parties and Observers, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
I would like to make a statement at the opening of the Sixth Annual Meeting of CCSBT. 
 
1. 
Although CCSBT has counted six annual meetings at this meeting since the First 
Annual Meeting held in May 1994 at Wellington, CCSBT had actually held more 
than ten meetings for the Annual Meetings of the Commission. On top of the 
Annual Meetings, these held the many meetings such as Scientific Committee, 
Ecologically Related Species Working Group, Trade Information Scheme 
Workshop and Joint Experimental Fishing Program Working Group, however, the 
Commission has been in a situation where it could not decide TAC and its 
allocation to Members because of the difference of views on the stock assessment. 
 
2. 
Japan proposed the joint experimental fishing program in 1998 and 1999 as a 
constructive proposal to facilitate to reach the consensus on management measures 
by narrowing the differences of scientific views among three Parties through 
obtaining CPUE data, which was the biggest but practically resolvable uncertainty 
amongst those relating to the stock assessment. On the other hand, there has been 
no practical proposal, which could lead a realistic concrete solution, from other 
Parties to resolve the issues relating to uncertainties. 
 
In fact, the Commission and the Scientific Committee could not reach agreement 
on even the models used for the stock assessment. It should be avoided to throw the 
Commission into further confusion by introducing new stock assessment methods 
or uncertainties only to widen the difference of views. 
 
3. 
Japan actively participated in the Peer Review and Management Strategy Workshop 
held in the last week in a constructive manner. The Peer Review Workshop has 
produced magnificent results because of the genuine will of Japan to normalize the 
scientific process in the Commission. To date, the Scientific Committee has not 
given a freedom or independent role to external scientists to provide their own 
views. The Committee has not allow either any involvement by external scientists 
for composing the report of the meeting, and rejected the views of external 
scientists eventually in spite of the presentation made independently by external 
scientists. This never contributed to solving the situation stemming from the 
confrontation among scientists of three Parties. At the Peer Review Workshop last 
week, it was decided that Advisory Panel consisting of independent external 
scientists shall help the Scientific Committee to reach consensus, and that, when 
consensus is not achieved, the Advisory Panel is allowed to make advice and 
present their views independently and without any condition to the Commission on 
the stock assessment, management measures and research programs. Japan 
appreciates that Australia changed its original position that requires the Advisory 
Panel to report through the Scientific Committee, not independently (i.e. Australia 
seemed to have changed its position that did not give external scientists the same 
status as national scientists). 
 
4. 
The presentation by Dr. Smith at the Management Strategy Workshop last week 
was useful for us to understand that Australia employed the simple and robust 
management measures domestically based on the limited available data and that the 
domestic management strategy was established through discussion among 
managers, scientists and industry people. However, we were disturbed to know that 
Australia was considering introducing new management measures without learning 
and scrutinizing practices, rationale or experiences of other regional fisheries 
organizations. The CCSBT should learn from the past when and where the CCSBT 
was in dys-function. The Management Strategy Workshop should develop the 
management strategy for SBT based on outside experience and expertise, such as 
the result of FAO Consultation of Experts on Fisheries Indicators and management 
strategies to be developed by other regional tuna organizations. The CCSBT should 
also make due consideration to Optimum Utilization, which is one of objectives of 
the Convention. It is also important to set the priority on narrowing the deference 
on current VPA models and parameters and agreeing to the stock assessment under 
current management strategy which is to rebuild spawning stock biomass to the 
1980 level by 2020, which is the target of the Commission. 
 
5. 
Japan has been proposing for years the increase of TAC by 3,000 ton. This proposal 
is based on the appropriate scientific evidences and in line of the objectives of the 
Convention, which is to achieve optimum utilization while conserving the stock. 
Japan has a view that current TAC of 11,750 tons should be increased by 3,000 tons 
as well as by necessary amount for appropriate national allocations to Non-Parties 
when acceding to the Convention. 
 
6. 
Japan considers that other management measures than TAC should also be 
introduced. The current operation pattern and practices are causing significant 
damages on the recovery of the spawning stock biomass. Among the causes, 
 
(1) The first is the catch of the spawning stock by Indonesia. Indonesian catch of 
the spawning stock diminishes the effort by Parties to rebuilt the spawning stock, 
which is the target of the Commission. Therefore, Japan considers it necessary to 
introduce the restriction of SBT fisheries for the spawning stock. 
(2) The second issue is large amount of catch of juvenile fish. Recent large catch of 
juveniles mostly by purse seiners may cause to decrease the recruitment to the 
spawning stock. Therefore, we should introduce the restriction on catch of 
juveniles. Similar measures have been introduced by ICCAT. 
(3) Japan was exposed to the information that 250 to 400 tons of SBT, caught by 
Australian longliners operating off the East Coast of Australia, was discarded 
because these fishermen claimed that they had no ITQ. This is a serious problem, if 
the discard caused over-quota of SBT allocated to Australia, and we may need to 
make some actions as appropriate. 
 
7. 
While Non-Parties are operating without any restriction, the Experimental Fishing 
Programme proposed to resolve the deferent views on stock assessment among 
Parties has been under dispute, and Japan, which has been contributing as a 
responsible fishing nation to international organizations and regional fisheries 
management organizations, was appealed to the International Tribunal of Low of 
the Sea. Japan considered that this is serious situation. Therefore, Japan has 
participated positively in the attempt to resolve the global problem under the 
international framework and urged Non-Parties to accede to the Convention or 
cooperate with CCSBT. Needless to say that Japan was making every effort to 
finalize the trade information scheme as soon as possible, and has urged 
Non-Parties to accede to or cooperate with the Convention or the Commission. 
Japan urges the other members to reach agreement for the introduction of trade 
information scheme at this meeting. Japan also proposes an Action Plan for 
Non-parties to facilitate their accession or cooperation and urge them to cooperate 
with conservation and management measures of SBT, and hopes to reach 
agreement to the proposal. Japan is committed to normalization of function of 
CCSBT and achievement of sustainable global SBT fisheries as soon as possible 
through these actions. 
 
8. 
Japan has cooperated to CCSBT in order to ensure conservation and optimum 
utilization of SBT to the extent possible. We presented constructive proposal to and 
participated in the discussions at Working Group to develop the joint experimental 
fishing programme early this year. However, the Working Group failed to reach 
agreement and no joint research has been conducted. Japan considered it important 
to continue to implement the experimental fishing programme to resolve 
uncertainties on the stock assessment when no agreement is reached at this Annual 
Meeting on an appropriate TAC. Therefore, Japan is preparing the proposal for 
joint Experimental Fishing Programme and will circulate it to other Parties early 
next year. I hope that the Commission holds the Experimental Fishing Programme 
Working Group Meeting to consider the programme and that conduct the 
programme jointly after reaching agreement. 
 
9. 
Currently port calls to Australia by Japanese fishing vessels have been suspended.  
As the main point of the provisional measures prescribed on 27 August this year 
could be considered to temporarily restore the situation at the time of 1997 when 
agreement was lastly reached. Japan urges Australia, for the sake of restoration of 
the current situation, to reopen its ports immediately, because it allowed port calls 
by Japanese fishing vessels in 1997 and started to reject them after Japanese 
initiation of the experimental fishing. 
 
10. Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the host government, the 
Government of Australia, and persons in charge and staff of the CCSBT Secretariat 
for the preparation of holding this meeting. I hope, by having realistic cooperative 
posture of other member nations, CCSBT will make progress for New Year of 
2000. 
 
Thank you.

New Zealand Opening Statement   CCSBT6(1) 
29-30 November 1999 
 
 
Good morning and greetings to the delegations from Australia and Japan. The 
attendance of observers from South Africa and IOTC is gratifying and we extend a 
particular welcome to the delegations from Taiwan and Korea. 
 
The period since the last Commission meeting has been difficult and has strained our 
longstanding working relationships. However, despite these differences, shared goals 
have been evident - to have a comprehensive and agreed assessment of stock status as a 
base for management decisions, to ensure future sustainable yields from the stock and to 
consolidate the Commission as an effective management agency to achieve these 
objectives. 
 
This is the first meeting of CCSBT since the rulings and instructions from ITLOS and 
the negotiations held in Canberra in September pursuant to the ITLOS order. These 
negotiations, as the record shows, were held in a positive and constructive atmosphere 
and reflected the desire of the three parties to the Commission to move from the 
previous period of difficulty to a period of co-operation. 
 
The ITLOS gave clear and unambiguous rulings on the events that have occurred within 
the Commission. They also assessed the different approaches taken by the parties to 
date. Their comprehensive ruling makes it unnecessary to provide a rebuttal to all of the 
points made in Japans statement with which we disagree. 
 
However, with respect to Japan's assertion that the TAC should be increased, we note 
that this was not a view that found favour with ITLOS. The body heard extensive 
evidence from Japan as well as Australia and New Zealand on the state of the stock.  
Although it was not a matter on which the tribunal was called to decide, six judges 
made a separate declaration in which they stated that a reduction in the catch of all those 
involved in the fishery in the immediate short term would assist the stock to recover 
over the medium to long term. They noted that Article 64 of UNCLOS lays down a duty 
to co-operate to that end. 
 
As to the experimental fishing programme proposed by Japan, I would simply note that 
we will always support increasing our knowledge of the stock through sound scientific 
research. I emphasise the word "sound" - our difficulties with Japan's proposed EFPs 
were that they did not in our view represent effective means to resolve the uncertainties 
in the stock assessment. 
 
For New Zealand the integrity and future function of the Commission are paramount.  
Without an effective Commission responsible for SBT, the future for the stock and the 
consequent returns through utilisation, are threatened and will not be achieved. 
 
We have limited time in this two day meeting and therefore need to use available time 
prudently to make progress on the five key issues agreed in September. We believe this 
is best achieved through utilising the range of skills within our delegations in focussed 
working groups that apply themselves to resolving any remaining issues, and develop 
clear processes to finalise initiatives. 
 
At this meeting, we have the two most important distant water fishers of SBT currently 
outside the Commission. We need to quickly complete the remaining steps toward 
achieving their commitment to the responsibilities and obligations of participation in the 
Commission. This will substantially improve the effectiveness of the regime. We will 
also encourage South Africa to take the steps necessary to accede to the Commission. 
 
While finalising the incorporation of key players involved in the fishery, the 
Commission should expeditiously take the remaining steps to establish a trade 
information scheme. Ultimately this scheme will not only ensure we obtain the data 
critical for assessment and management but it will provide the incentives to encourage 
cooperation with the Commission by others fishing for SBT. 
 
The members have agreed in principle on the mechanisms we intend to employ to 
resolve issues in the stock assessment and the scientific process used by the 
Commission. We need to endorse the outcomes agreed by the working group last week, 
and promptly agree on any further detail necessary to implement a cost effective process 
to provide us with the assessment advice that is central to judicious management 
decisions. These improvements to the scientific process are central to allowing the 
agreed recovery targets to be reached through an improved management strategy and 
consequent improved procedures to set TACs. 
 
As a result of recent events, the international community will closely examine the steps 
this commission takes to resolve our differences and make progress on critical issues.  
The New Zealand delegation is committed to make every effort so that the next two 
days are a constructive and productive exchange of ideas with concrete outcomes.

AUSTRALIA'S OPENING STATEMENT 
 
 
Thank you Mr Chairman. In thanking the past Chair for closing CCSBTS, 1 would also 
like to pass Australia's thanks to Mr Takasae of Japan for his stewardship of CCSBT5 
through a very difficult year. 
 
As host country for CCSBT6, I would like to welcome the parties to CCSBT, Japan and 
New Zealand and the non-parties, Taiwan, Korea and South Africa along with the 
representative from the IOTC. 
 
It is very useful to all of us to see you at the table as it clearly demonstrates the strength 
of purpose that a CCSBT that involves all of us would have. 
 
I was going to introduce my delegation, however, I wanted to make a short statement it 
is sufficient to say they are numerous and a high level industry and government 
delegation. 
 
We the participants in the global SBT fishery have arrived at a critical point. Never 
before have our scientific and management arrangements come under such intense 
international scrutiny as in this past year. The orders handed down by the International 
Tribunal for the Law of the Sea made it abundantly clear what is expected of this 
Commission. The parties now have a clear direction on what we need to do to make real 
progress and, in doing so, we must never lose sight of the objectives of the Commission, 
that is the conservation and optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna. 
 
Building on the good will and progress shown by all parties at the September 
negotiations, and over the four days workshop of last week, I am confident that this 
Commission can now tackle the important challenges before us. I will briefly outline 
Australia's view on the priorities as we see them. 
 
1. 
First is the non-member parties. Clearly it is important of all SBT catching 
 
countries to work jointly towards conserving and managing the stock. With us 
 
today we have delegations from two of the major non-parties. We (Japan, Australia 
 
and New Zealand) undertook a demarche to Korea and Taiwan last month where 
 
we engaged in very worthwhile negotiations. I believe that we now have a very 
 
strong basis from which to proceed forward on the issues of catch allocation and 
 
related matters of accession. With good faith, and the right will, we can resolve 
 
these issues. 
 
2. 
Second is the Trade Information Scheme. Trade information schemes are being 
developed and implemented by other Regional Fishery Management Organisations 
 as it becomes increasingly apparent that we need additional arrangements to 
 complement the traditional fisheries surveillance and enforcement measures. To be 
 fully useful in managing the overall fishery, the scheme must collect trade 
 information from all SBT catching/exporting and importing/consuming countries. 
 In other words, it must cover all SBT, and it must be seen to be doing exactly that -  
it must be transparent. Australia believes we have such a scheme now ready for 
adoption. 
 
3. 
We were encouraged by the outcomes of the Peer Review and Management 
Strategy Workshops and we will come to a report on their outcomes latter in the 
meeting. 
 
4. 
Fourth is an agreed Scientific Research Program to provide the overarching 
framework for strategic and long term research projects. This issue has caused 
much division within the CCSBT, and if there is a way forward for scientific 
research to enhance our knowledge of the fishery, that can be accepted by all 
parties it will be through this framework and with the assistance of the external 
scientists. We have flagged that we will not tolerate unilateral experimental fishing 
programs and we will not accord a status to the results of unscientific or biased 
research programs. 
 
So finally Mr Chairman, I want to say that Australia brings to this meeting of CCSBT a 
very strong desire to move forward and resolve the matters I have outlined above - to 
the mutual satisfaction of all parties. The international community now has very high 
expectations of CCSBT and I believe that, with cooperation and willpower at the table 
from all sides, we can renew our efforts and lay the foundations to make the CCSBT 
into the best regional fishery management organisation anywhere in the world. But it 
will take just that, a real contribution and commitment to change and to be flexible from 
all parties. We must find away to go forward together. 
 
Thank you Mr Chairman.

OPENING STATEMENT - THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA 
 
 
Thank you Mr Chairman, Distinguished delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen 
 
At the outset, on behalf of the Korean delegation and myself, I would like to express my 
deep gratitude to you and CCSBT members for inviting the Korean delegation to attend 
this very important Annual Meeting. The appreciation of the Korean delegation also 
goes to the Secretariat for making arrangements for the Korean delegation to come to 
Canberra to attend this meeting. The Korean delegation will fully cooperate with you 
and members so that under your able leadership, this meeting will be conducted in the 
most productive manner. 
 
The Republic of Korea, as you are well aware, has devoted itself to the completion of 
the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea by active participation in the negotiation to 
draft the Convention and also to the conservation of marine resources by participating in 
existing regional organisations for conservation of highly migratory fish stocks such as 
ICCAT and IOTC. The Republic of Korea is consistently maintaining the same position 
as before, and will continue its cooperation for sustainable conservation and 
management of marine living resources. 
 
As to the conservation of southern bluefin tuna (SBT), which is the case here, Korea 
fully recognizes the importance of effective conservation and optional utilisation for 
sustainability of SBT resources, and moreover, has joined the efforts of the CCSBT. 
Korea, as a responsible fishing country, has implemented self-imposed restraint in SBT 
catch from this year, to cooperate with international fishing community including the 
CCSBT. Korea's fishing industry will faithfully adhere to the voluntarily-imposed catch 
limit of 1,600 ton a year for the time being. In addition, Korea has withdrawn three 
fishing vessels from the SBT fishing area, thereby reducing catch capacity from 19 
vessels to 16 vessels. 
 
Korea will provide relevant catch and effort data to the Trade Information Scheme, if 
this Scheme is finalised and adopted by the Commission. Furthermore, Korea wishes to 
dispatch its scientists to the CCSBT Scientific Committee to participate in the scientific 
activities of the Commission. Theses cooperative measures of Korea with CCSBT will 
be continued pending Korea's membership of CCSBT. Korea will fully observe its 
obligations under other international agreements for conservation and management of 
marine living resources. 
 
To undertake full responsibility in conserving and managing the SBT resources, Korea 
has sought membership of the CCSBT. However, this has not yet been realised so far, 
mainly because the CCSBT's offer of quota for Korea is far from the fishing reality of 
Korea. In parallel with its obligation for conservation, Korea's fishing rights and 
interests should also be respected. I sincerely hope that the annual quota level we 
proposed to the CCSBT delegation during their visit to Korea last October will be 
acceptable to the CCSBT. The proposed quota level was negotiated in the midst of 
strong resistance and political pressure from fishing industry for higher level to reflect 
their current catch. 
 
We would like to reiterate our willingness for early accession to the CCSBT, which we 
believe will mutually benefit Korea and CCSBT members. Procrastination of Korea's 
accession will be against conservation efforts of the CCSBT. Therefore, positive 
understanding and cooperation as well as political consideration on the part of members 
of CCSBT towards Korea's position is highly required for realisation of Korea's early 
accession. 
 
We subscribe to the goal pursued by the CCSBT and are well prepared to follow its 
steps. However, we are confident that there is room to be improved to materialise this 
goal, which requires looking back the history, seeing to the present and planning for the 
future: why the current urgency of SBT conservation occurred; how the fishing stock is 
assessed and relevant data is processed; how the stock will be conserved and utilised in 
a fair manner. 
 
We look forward to having fruitful discussions during the Annual Meeting and to 
reaching a most successful outcomes, particularly in favour of Korea's early accession 
to the CCSBT.

Remarks by Eugene Grobler. Counsellor. South African High Commission 
 
 
Thank you Mr Chair and good morning to all delegations. 
 
1. 
 South Africa is grateful to he able to attend the Commission for the Conservation 
 
of Southern Bluefin Tuna: Sixth Annual Meeting. 
 
2.  South Africa is not a Tuna Fishing country as such, but other countries are fishing 
 
for tuna in South African waters. 
 
3.  South Africa is currently seriously considering membership of the Commission for 
 
the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, and a decision will he taken soon. 
 
4.  South Africa is in agreement with all the instruments for the use and conservation 
 
of sea and marine resources, including the principals and approaches of this 
 
convention. 
 
5.  South Africa has a good track record in this regard. 
 
Thank you

OPENING STATEMENT BY TAIWAN 
November 29, 1999 
 
 
On behalf of the Taiwan delegation, I would like to express our gratitude to 
CCBST for inviting us to participate in this meeting. 
 
As a tuna fishing nation, we realize the importance of conservation and 
management of tuna resources for the sustainable utilization. We also understand that in 
order to achieve this goal, the common efforts among all countries concerned are 
essential. That is why my delegation accepts the invitation and to be here. 
 
For the purpose of the conservation of SBT, in line with the resolution made by 
CCSBT in 1995, Taiwan has imposed itself a voluntary measure of limiting its annual 
catch of SBT at 1,450 MT since 1996. To implement such measure, my government has 
stipulated an executive regulation, which specifies the responsibility of our fishing boats 
involved, such as weekly report of the daily catch of SBT and fishing location to the 
fishery authorities and provision of logbooks while the fishing operation being finished. 
In addition, we also dispatched scientists to take care of the matters on SBT research 
and the incidental catch of seabirds and issued the brochures that guide our fishermen 
how to prevent incidental catch of seabirds. 
 
Mr. Chairman, Taiwan is not a party to the Convention for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna. It has no obligation to take such measures. However, it has done 
what I just described. We do think that the above efforts made by our government 
should be duly recognized and appreciated by all governments involved in fishing for 
SBT. 
 
Mr. Chairman, as a major fishing nation in the world, we think that it is the time for 
us to normalize our relationship with CCSBT. Therefore, I would like to take this 
opportunity to hand over a letter applying for a Contracting Party status to the 
Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. We do hope that our 
application will be seriously considered. I would also like to emphasize that if an 
arrangement is needed to make our Party status possible, we would only accept an 
arrangement that is fair, workable, and duly respecting Taiwan’s status. 
 
Finally, I am looking forward to a constructive discussion in the next two days.  
My delegation appreciates very much for the wonderful arrangement and hospitality 
extended by the hosting country – Australia.

RESOLUTION BY CCSBT 
CONCERNING AN ACTION PLAN TO ENSURE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE 
CONSERVATION MEASURES FOR SOUTHERN BLUEFIN TUNA 
 
 
RECOGNIZING that the objectives of the CCSBT are conservation and optimum 
utilization of southern bluefin tuna (SBT); 
 
BEING AWARE that a significant number of vessels registered to non-Contracting 
Parties to CCSBT are catching SBT; 
 
COCERNING the need for urgent action to ensure the effectiveness of the CCSBT 
conservation measures for SBT; 
 
BEING AWARE of the strenuous efforts by Contracting Parties to encourage 
non-Contracting Parties to accede the Convention or cooperate with the CCSBT; 
 
 
THE COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION FOR THE SOUTHERN 
BLUEFIN TUNA(CCSBT) RESOLVES THAT: 
 
a. 
The Commission shall request that non-Contracting Parties fishing SBT cooperate 
 
fully with the Commission in implementing the CCSBT measures for conservation, 
 
management and optimum utilization of SBT (hereinafter referred to as "the 
 
conservation and management measures"). The Commission shall also request 
 
those non-Contracting Parties to advise the Commission of actions taken in that 
 
regard. 
 
b. 
The Commission shall identify, at the Resumed 6th Annual Meeting to be held in 
 
early year 2000 and annually thereafter, those non-Contracting Parties whose 
 
vessels have been fishing for SBT in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness 
 
of the CCSBT conservation and management measures, based on the catch data 
 
compiled by the Commission, the trade information and other relevant information 
 
obtained in parts and at the fishing ground. 
 
c. 
The Commission shall request those Parties identified in paragraph (b) to rectify 
 
their fishing activities so as not to diminish the effectiveness of CCSBT 
 
conservation and management measures and to advise the Commission of actions 
 
taken in that regard. 
 
d. 
The Contracting Parties shall jointly and individually request that non-Contracting 
 
Parties fishing SBT cooperate fully with the Commission in implementing the 
 
CCSBT SBT conservation and management measures. 
 
e. 
The Commission shall review, at appropriate timing, the actions taken by those 
 
Parties identified and requested in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), and identify the 
 
Parties which have not rectified their fishing activities. 
 
f. 
To ensure the effectiveness of the CCSBT conservation and management measures, 
 
the Commission will recommend the Contracting Parties to take non-
 
discriminatory trade restrictive measure, consistent with their international 
 
obligations, on SBT products in any form, from the Parties identified in paragraph 
 
(e). 
 
Attachment M 
 
CCSBT 
Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document Program 
 
 
 
1. Principle/General 
 
1.1 For importation into the territory of a Member, all southern bluefin tuna shall be 
accompanied by a CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document. There is no 
waiver of this requirement. 
 
1.2 Implementation of this Program shall be in conformity with relevant international 
obligations. 
 
1.3 The Commission will review the implementation of this Program periodically in a 
timely manner to ensure the effectiveness and practicability of this Program. 
 
1.4 The Commission requests the appropriate authorities of exporting countries/fishing 
entities to make the requirements under this Program known to their exporters. 
 
2. Information Required 
 
2.1 A standard CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document form along with its 
Instruction Sheet is at Annex 1. Countries/Fishing Entities are requested to use this 
form. While minimal modifications such as addition of translations may be made, 
the standard form should be adopted as far as possible and no information item may 
be omitted from the standard form. 
 
2.2 The import of farmed tuna should be treated in the following way: 
 
(a) The Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document shall be validated by the 
authority of the country/fishing entity where the tuna was raised; 
 
(b) [When Members compile data from the Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical 
documents under 5.1 and report import data collected by the Program to the 
Executive Secretary under 5.2] {to be modified based on the modification in 
"5. Record and Report"}, the amount of imported farmed fish will be recorded 
separately from the rest of the imports for each country/fishing entity; 
 
(c) When completing the CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document for 
farmed tuna, the name of the export country/fishing entity shall be indicated in 
item 1 of Export Section of each Document instead of “Flag Country/Fishing 
Entity of Capture Vessel”, and the name of the Tuna Farm shall be indicated in 
item 2 of Export Section of each Document instead of “Name of Vessel and 
Registration Number”; for item 6 (Description of Fish) of Export Section of 
each Document, “Gear Code” shall be “Farmed”, “Net Weight” shall be filled in 
with the raised products’ weight, and “Time of Harvest” and “Area of Catch” 
are not necessary to be filled in while other columns shall be filled in as in the 
case of the normal Document; 
 
(d) Tuna farms which raise exported tuna are obliged to keep the following 
information: the name of the fishing vessel which caught the tuna for farming, 
the flag country/fishing entity of that fishing vessel, the gear code, the amount 
and original size of catch, the area of catch, the date of reception of tuna, and 
growth rate and mortality rate of fish through farming; 
 
(e) The tuna farm shall submit such information to CCSBT through its government 
upon the request of the CCSBT Secretariat. 
 
3. Validation 
 
3.1 The CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document shall be validated, in 
principle, by an official of the flag country/fishing entity of the vessel that harvested 
the tuna. 
 
3.2 The requirement for validation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document 
by an official under 3.1 with respect to any member of the Commission may be met 
by an entity duly delegated by the authority of the flag country/fishing entity. The 
Member which utilizes a delegated entity should submit a certified copy of such 
delegation to the Executive Secretary. 
 
4. Exchange of Information 
 
4.1 If a Member modifies the standard Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document 
form for its use, it shall provide to the Executive Secretary a copy of such modified 
form. The Executive Secretary shall provide the modified form to other Members 
and non-Members fishing and exporting southern bluefin tuna to Members. 
 
4.2 Each Member shall provide to the Executive Secretary information on validation 
(e.g. type of validation, name of the organization which validates the documents, 
title of officials who validate the documents, sample impression of stamp or seal) 
and inform him of any change in a timely fashion. The Executive Secretary shall 
request information on validation from all non-Members fishing and exporting 
southern bluefin tuna to Members, and request them to inform him in a timely 
fashion of any change in the information provided. 
 
4.3 The Executive Secretary shall maintain and update information specified in 4.1 and 
4.2, and provide it to all Members and promptly circulate any changes. 
 
5. Record and Report 
 
5.1 [Members which export or import southern bluefin tuna]/[The Executive Secretary]

6. Re-export 
 
6.1 A Member may validate CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Re-export Certificate (a 
standard form is attached as Annex 3) for southern bluefin tuna imported by that  
Member, to which CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document or CCSBT 
Southern Bluefin Tuna Re-export Certificate is attached. CCSBT Southern Bluefin 
Tuna Re-export Certificate shall be validated by an official or by an entity duly 
delegated by the authority of a Member to validate the CCSBT Southern Bluefin 
Tuna Statistical Document under 3.2. A copy of the original Southern Bluefin Tuna 
Statistical Document accompanying the imported southern bluefin tuna must be 
attached to CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Re-export Certificate. The copy of 
original Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document so attached must be verified by 
that official or by that entity duly delegated by the authority of a Member which 
validate the CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document. When re-exported 
southern bluefin tuna is again re-exported, all copies of documents, including 
verified copy of a Statistical Document and Re-export Certificate which 
accompanied that southern bluefin tuna upon importation, must be attached to a new 
Re-export Certificate to be validated by a re-exporting Memebr. All copies of the 
Documents to be attached to that new Re-export Certificate must also be verified by 
an official or an entity duly delegated by the authority of a Member which validated 
the CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document. 
 
6.2 Members which import southern bluefin tuna shall accept the Re-export Certificate 
set forth in 6.1 with attachments of all verified copies as required in 6.1. 
 
6.3 Members that validate a Re-export Certificate in accordance with the procedure set 
forth in 6.1 shall require from the re-exporting southern bluefin tuna dealer 
necessary documents (e.g. written sales contracts) which are to certify that the 
southern bluefin tuna to be re-exported corresponds to the imported southern bluefin 
tuna. Members which validate a Re-export Certificate shall provide the flag 
country/fishing entity and importing country with evidence of this correspondence 
upon their request. 
 
6.4 [Members which import southern bluefin tuna]/[The Executive Secretary] shall 
report the data obtained from Re-export Certificates [to the Executive Secretary] 
each year by 1 April for the period of 1 July - 31 December of the preceding year 
and 1 October for the period of 1 January - 30 June of the current year, which shall 
be circulated to all Members by the Executive Secretary. The format of the report is 
attached as Annex 4. 
{to be modified to reflect the agreement that the Secretariat should play the central 
role to manage the data subject to further consideration for cost implication and 
resource availability}
