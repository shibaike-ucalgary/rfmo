Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
6. 
Members noted the report from the Secretariat.  There were no comments on the 
report. 
7. 
Australia noted that the sale of mortalities from the Australian east coast tagging 
pilot should not necessarily be assured to be used to offset contributions from other 
members within this special research program.

Agenda Item 3. 
Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
8. 
The Executive Secretary presented papers CCSBT-EC/0310/05 (Revised budget 
2003) and CCSBT-EC/0310/06 (Draft budget 2004).  Adjustments made to the 
budgets since the development of these papers were also described. 
9. 
The Finance and Administration Committee was convened to consider the revised 
budget for 2003 and the proposed budget for 2004.  New Zealand was nominated to 
chair this meeting. 
10. To assist the Finance and Administrative Committee in its deliberations the 
Extended Commission provided the following guidance: 
• The Extended Commission will meet the costs of holding meetings in the host 
country’s capital city. If a member wishes to hold meetings outside the capital city, 
the host country will be required to meet any additional costs. 
• It is desirable that the contributions required of members be kept stable. As a 
broad guide the Extended Commission would like to see fluctuations in the 
contributions from members maintained within 10% of the previous year’s 
contribution. 
• The funding formula for member contributions for the tagging program Special 
Budget for 2004 should be the allocation formula used for the general budget. 
11. The Extended Commission noted New Zealand’s comment that this formula was 
inappropriate for special budgets for scientific research conducted by the Extended 
Commission when there were little or no administrative costs associated with the 
research program.  New Zealand considers itself to be disadvantaged by the 
application of this formula because the benefits accrue to members in proportion to 
the relative share of the fishery.  Taiwan associated itself with New Zealand’s 
comments. 
12. It was agreed that the funding formula for special budgets for scientific research 
would be reviewed and considered at CCSBT 11. 
13. It was also agreed that the allocation formula for the general budget would also be 
reviewed.  It was noted that the current formula acted as a disincentive to accession 
to the Extended Commission by developing countries engaged in the fishery. 
14. The Secretariat was asked to develop discussion papers on the funding formulas and 
to provide these to members well in advance of CCSBT 11. 
15. To assist members and the Secretariat in minimising fluctuations in members’ 
contributions, the Finance and Administration Committee agreed that future budgets 
presented by the Secretariat to the Extended Commission should include the revised 
budget for the current year, the proposed budget for the following year and an 
indicative budget for the subsequent year.  The Extended Commission agreed to this 
proposal. 
16. The agreed general and special revised budgets for 2003 are at Attachment 6a.  The 
agreed general and special budgets for 2004 are at Attachment 6b.

Agenda Item 4. 
Relationship with non-members 
17. The Executive Secretary presented the report on the relationship with non-members 
(CCSBT-EC/0310/07). 
18. Members provided introductory comments regarding the relationships with non-
members.  In particular, members were pleased that Indonesia and the Philippines 
have expressed interest in becoming cooperating non-members and that the 
Seychelles has indicated through Japan that the Seychelles will not fish for SBT. 
19. Members expressed views that further consideration needed to be given to South 
Africa’s relationship with the CCSBT.  Specific comments were made supporting 
South Africa’s entitlement to develop their SBT fishery.  Some members expressed 
concerns about development of a flag of convenience fishery in South Africa. 
20. The Philippines advised that it intended to fully cooperate with the management and 
conservation objectives of the Extended Commission.  It was reported that the 
Philippines had exported 22 tonnes of SBT in the first half of this year.  The 
Philippines stated that its SBT catch this year was a by-catch but that it wished to 
develop a targeted SBT fishery in the future. 
21. Japan advised that it has reported importing 15 tonnes of SBT from China, but that 
this was actually Japanese catch that was processed in China and re-imported into 
Japan.  New Zealand felt that China should be engaged in discussion on cooperation 
with the CCSBT despite the current absence of SBT catches from China. 
22. It was agreed that the relationship with non-members would also be discussed in the 
context of agenda item 5. 
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Cooperating non-member status 
23. The Extended Commission adopted a resolution to provide for cooperating non-
member status.  The resolution is at Attachment 7.  In adopting the resolution, the 
Extended Commission noted that cooperating non-member status is not intended as a 
permanent arrangement and that cooperating non-members should ultimately accede 
to the Convention. 
24. It was agreed that the Executive Secretary would write to South Africa, the 
Philippines and Indonesia inviting them to apply for membership of the Extended 
Commission as cooperating non-members.  The Executive Secretary’s invitation to 
apply would set out the conditions on which the invitations were being extended. 
25. The Extended Commission identified the importance of assisting Indonesia to be 
able to meet the obligations of a cooperating non-member.  To this end, it was 
agreed that the Commission would conduct discussions in Indonesia before the 
special ad-hoc meeting to be held in April 2004. 
 
4 
Agenda Item 6. 
Action Plan 
26. The Executive Secretary presented the report from the Secretariat on the status of the 
Action Plan (CCSBT-EC/0310/09). 
27. Members agreed that no further action needed to be taken against Belize, Cambodia, 
Equatorial Guinea and Honduras at the present time due to the current lack of 
catches (as deduced from the Trade Information Scheme and Japanese import 
statistics) from these countries.  Japan also noted that the Action Plan was related to 
the IUU framework and that implementation of the IUU fishing positive list would 
impact on decisions taken pursuant to the Action Plan. 
28. It was agreed that further action against the Seychelles can be suspended on the basis 
of undertakings it has given to the Commission and in particular, the cooperative 
framework between the Seychelles and Japan in which the Seychelles has agreed not 
to fish for SBT. 
29. Both the Philippines and Indonesia have undertaken to cooperate with the CCSBT 
and as a consequence of this, no further action is required against these nations. 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Review of SBT fisheries 
30. Reports on the SBT fisheries of members of the Extended Commission are included 
at Attachment 8. 
31. In response to questions, members of the Extended Commission made the following 
main points of clarification: 
• Australia advised that the 15 tonne mortality calculated for the damaged tow cage 
referenced in the Australian letter to members was an estimate based on the best 
available information.  Australia further advised that currently, quota is deducted 
when the fish are transferred from tow cages to static cages (including any 
mortality that occurred during the catching and tow operations) and that in future 
it is proposed to use an estimate of the catch weight when the fish are first 
captured and that this estimate will be used as a provisional quota deduction.  
Australia agreed to provide a written report on the changes in management that 
are proposed following the accident with the tow cage. 
• Korea advised that its low catch of 649 tonnes (processed weight) for 2002 and 
the expected further reduction to around 400 tonnes (processed weight) for 2003 
was a consequence of the reduced economic return for SBT fishing. 
32. Following presentations of national reports, Australia proposed that members should 
advise the Extended Commission of their catches on a monthly basis.   
 
5 
Agenda Item 8. 
Report from the Scientific Committee 
33. The Chair of the Scientific Committee, Mr Penney provided a detailed account of the 
report of the Eighth meeting of the Scientific Committee, which is provided at 
Attachment 9. 
34. The Extended Scientific Committee sought feedback from the Commission on three 
items, these being: 
• Approval of the standards for the CCSBT Scientific Observer program that were 
finalised at the Extended Scientific Committee meeting; 
• Whether the Extended Commission wished the Extended Scientific Committee to 
take over the responsibility of preparing the annual SBT report for ICCAT; and 
• Whether the Extended Commission wanted a Management Procedure consultation 
to be conducted following the Third Meeting of the Management Procedure 
Workshop (MPWS3). 
35. The Extended Commission approved the standards for the CCSBT Scientific 
Observer Program and noted that Taiwan and Korea stated they would have 
difficulties in achieving the target of 10% observer coverage.  Japan urged those two 
members to implement a scientific observer program as soon as possible. 
36. There was consensus that the Extended Scientific Committee should have the 
responsibility of preparing the annual SBT report to ICCAT. 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Management Procedure 
37. The Chair of the Scientific Committee made a presentation on the selection of 
management procedures for SBT (CCSBT-EC/0310/26).  Progress with the 
management procedure (MP) development process was reviewed.  Provided 
guidance is received from the Extended Commission on management objectives and 
trade-offs, the MP process should be completed on schedule at MPWS3 in April 
2004.  The industry consultation process concluded that with the exception of New 
Zealand industry, there was no strong desire to increase catches at present, but also 
no desire to see sudden or substantial catch decreases.  This suggests that 
management procedures should be asymmetric with slow increases in TAC under 
high productivity scenarios, while providing for TAC decreases in low productivity 
scenarios. 
38. The example (CPUE based) management procedure used in the industry 
consultations was used to illustrate the trade-off between catch and spawning stock 
biomass recovery under low, mid and high productivity scenarios, using cautious 
(recovery orientated), moderate or aggressive (catch orientated) MPs.  Under low 
productivity, biomass recovery will not occur without decreases in catches, whereas, 
under high productivity, re-building can occur even with some catch increase. 
6 
39. A selection of candidate MPs will be evaluated at MPWS3, and presented to 
CCSBT11 for selection of the final MP to use for SBT.  These will probably be 
based closely on the candidates already being developed and tested by members.  In 
considering these procedures, members will have to make choices along two key 
trade-off axes: 
• The strong trade-off between catch levels and re-building of biomass.  Higher 
catches reduce the scope for re-building, and vice versa; 
• There is also a trade-off between TAC stability (frequency of TAC change) and 
the magnitude of TAC changes.  Frequent TAC changes are likely to be smaller, 
whereas less frequent changes may require larger changes.  More frequent 
changes should also result in increased average catches over time. 
40. The Extended Commission was asked to provide guidance on: 
• Whether the proposed biomass bounds for tuning MPs are appropriate (B2022/B2002 
= 0.7, 1.1, and 1.5)? 
• Should more MPs be explored around the moderate one, or should more cautious 
or aggressive MPs be explored? 
41. Regarding the trade-off in TAC stability, the MPWS3 and SC plan to explore 
policies that either update policies annually, or every three years. 
• Should other (longer) time periods between TAC changes be considered? 
42. The Extended Scientific Committee will provide the following “performance 
measures” for the candidate MPs presented for consideration.  Are these sufficient, 
or is other information required to evaluate candidate MPs (such as performance 
relative to MSY, or performance at 5 year, 10 year or longer than 20 year time 
periods)? 
• Average catch to 2020; 
• Average spawning biomass to 2020; 
• Spawning stock biomass relative to 2002; 
• Spawning stock biomass relative to 1980; 
• Frequency of TAC change; 
• Proportion of simulations exceeding specific thresholds (still to be specified). 
43. Australia noted a preference for a lower bound on B2022/B2002 of 0.9, evaluation of 
MP performance at 5 year intervals after implementation, 3 year intervals between 
TAC changes and a 12 - 18 month delay in implementation of TAC changes.  
Movement away from the existing objective of 1980 biomass levels by 2020, and 
towards MSY as a management objective, could be considered, if agreed to by all 
members, and provided progress towards MSY could be measured. 
44. Japan noted that choice of the final MP would be influenced by understanding of the 
current state of the stock.  The results of the 2004 assessment will be available to 
CCSBT11, and members will be in a position to compare these with MP evaluation 
results, before making MP selections. 
7 
45. Questions were also asked regarding the feasibility of using MSY as a management 
objective for SBT, and the reasons for uncertainty in productivity and fluctuations in 
biomass projections, even under constant catch scenarios.  The many uncertainties 
and natural variations in key SBT stock parameters were briefly explained.  These 
would be expected to result in substantial natural variance in recruitment and state of 
the stock, and this is reflected in the MP projections. 
46. Members made the following additional comments regarding management 
objectives and their requirements for a MP: 
• Australia: 
o Considered that the current CCSBT management objective should be replaced 
by an achievable objective.  This could be an MSY objective, but an MSY 
objective would need to be properly defined. The management objective would 
also need to be one that resulted in some re-building of the stock. 
o Progress towards the management objective would need to be measured every 
five years. 
o Stability in TAC is desirable and a 3 year TAC would be a good start.  
Sufficient time would be required if a TAC cut is needed 
• Taiwan: 
o Believed that the current CCSBT management objective could not be reached 
and therefore agreed in principle to revising the objective. 
o Any changes in the TAC (up or down) should be gradual rather than rapid. 
o The TAC should be set for periods of 5 years or more to achieve catch stability. 
o National allocations should be an important part of the MP discussions so that 
any increases or decreases in TAC can be allocated in an agreed manner. 
• Japan: 
o Considered that the current CCSBT management objective was not achievable 
and that it was also a very strict objective.  A management objective that 
sought to achieve the MSY level would be more appropriate.  The period in 
which MSY should be achieved could be decided after selecting a MP and once 
more data become available. 
o Feedback to the Extended Scientific Committee was provided with Japan 
saying that it would like to see results from scenarios with a 5 year TAC and 
with the current catch maintained for the next 20 years.  It would also like to 
see results for performance measures based on MSY and to explore more 
moderate policies with biomass at 100% and 110% of the 2002 level. 
• New Zealand: 
o Considered that a key issue with the current CCSBT management objective 
was that there had been no strategy for achieving the objective and that 
consequently, there had been little progress.  An MSY based management 
objective could be considered, but there had to be an agreed MP to guide 
members towards that goal.  
8 
o Proposed that the current CCSBT management objective be kept until an 
alternative objective was agreed together with a suitable MP for reaching the 
management objective 
o Due to the low current state of the stock, a cautious or moderate MP catch 
policy was preferred over an aggressive policy. 
o A 3 year time frame is suitable for TAC changes.  A lead time of up to 12 
months was considered suitable for implementing TAC changes.  If the lead 
time was part of the 3 year TAC cycle, a stock assessment would be required 
every second year.  
o Performance indicators of spawning stock biomass relative to 2002 and 1980 
were critical and should be considered by the Extended Scientific Committee. 
• Korea: 
o From an administrative perspective (rather than a scientific stock status 
perspective), it would be best if the fishery was highly productive and if we 
could manage the fishery with an aggressive catch policy so that a future 
increase in stock, if any, would be retained by members, without giving an 
incentive to non-members. 
47. In response to the questions posed by the Extended Scientific Committee regarding 
management objectives and development of management procedures, 
Commissioners provided the following guidelines: 
Management Objectives 
• It was recognized that the existing objective of attaining the B1980 level by 2020 
was not feasible, and that the CCSBT would need to move to adopt a more 
feasible management objective.  This might be related to BMSY. 
• However, the implications of a change in objective requires further consideration 
by the Commission.  Further consideration could be given to management 
objectives at the proposed special meeting of Commissioners after the MP3 
workshop in April.  The final adoption of a new CCSBT management objective 
might best be addressed at CCSBT11, when candidate MPs are being considered. 
• With regard to the time frame for attaining whichever management objective is 
adopted, it was noted that this might also best be addressed at the CCSBT11 
meeting, once the projections results and performance measures for candidate 
MPs were available for consideration.  However, in addition to the performance 
measures suggested by the Extended Scientific Committee, these projections and 
performance measures will need to specifically address performance in relation to 
MSY, and should be extended to a projection period of 30 years. 
Bounds in Spawning Stock Biomass 
• The proposed bounds in ending spawning stock biomass (B2022/B2002 = 0.7 and 1.5) 
were accepted as upper and lower bounds for the purpose of tuning candidate 
management procedures.    However, more emphasis should be placed on 
exploring MPs around the moderate level (B2022/B2002 = 1.1). 
• With specific regard to the lower B2022/B2002 level of 0.7, there were some 
indications that a higher biomass level might be preferred as a lower bound, and 
9 
performance measures should be included to report on the proportion of 
projections in which the biomass drops below 90% and 80% of B2002 during, and 
at the end of, the projection period. 
Trade-Off in TAC Stability 
• There was consensus that the preferred period of time between TAC changes was 
3 years.  Alternate periods to be investigated as sensitivity analyses for 
comparison should be 1 and 5 years between TAC changes. 
• In addition, the Extended Scientific Committee was requested to consider an 
initial three year delay before any TAC change, and a  one year lag between 
decision and implementation of TAC changes. 
• There was also consensus that some limit on the maximum magnitude of TAC 
changes would be preferred.  The desire to limit the rate of any TAC increase to 
prevent market disruptions was confirmed.  There was no agreement on the actual 
limit and the SC was requested to explore options. 
An illustrative example of the management procedure runs and TAC change schedule 
which would result from implementation of a MP with the following characteristics is 
shown below: 
• Acceptance of the final SBT MP at CCSBT 11 in October 2004.  (The Commission 
may decide to manually change the TAC at this stage, either based on the 
recommendations of the chosen MP, based on the results of the 2004 full stock 
assessment, or due to other considerations). 
• An initial delay of 3 years without TAC change, before any TAC changes 
recommended by the MP are implemented. 
• A 1 year warning / time lag between running the MP and accepting a recommendation 
to change the TAC, and implementing that recommended TAC change. 
• A 3 year interval between TAC changes recommended by the MP.

Performance Measures 
• The biomass performance measures, particularly those comparing B to B2002 and 
B1980 were recognised as being particularly important.   
• In addition to reporting on the performance of the candidate MPs at the end of the 
projection period (now extended out to 30 years), these should be reported at 
periods of 5, 10 and 20 years. 
10 
• In view of the possible move towards a management objective related to MSY, 
performance measures should be developed and provided on the performance of 
candidate MPs in attaining BMSY. 
• With specific regard to performance relative to MSY, the Extended Scientific 
Committee is requested to investigate and report on levels of uncertainty in 
determining BMSY, and how effectively candidate MPs deal with this uncertainty 
and manage towards BMSY. 
48. It was agreed that a special ad hoc meeting of Commissioners should be held after 
the MP3 workshop in April 2004, to provide Commissioners with feedback on the 
results of the MP3 workshop.  This meeting will also give Commissioners an 
opportunity to give further consideration to management objectives 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Indonesian catch monitoring 
49. The Chair of the Scientific Committee briefed the Extended Commission on the 
outcome of the Indonesian Catch Monitoring Workshop.  The meeting 
acknowledged the high importance of this monitoring program to the Extended 
Commission’s conservation and management objectives. 
50. In discussion, Australia and Japan pointed out that they had been supporting the 
Indonesian catch monitoring effort financially for a number of years and that it was 
appropriate that the other members now contributed to this effort.  Australia and 
Japan stated that they would continue to support the monitoring for 2004 subject to 
consideration of funding by the Extended Commission in subsequent years at 
CCSBT 11.  It was agreed that the Secretariat would gather cost data from Japan and 
Australia and circulate that to other members intersessionally. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Total allowable catch and its allocation 
51. For the 2003/2004 fishing season, members agreed to: 
• A one year total allowable catch for members of 14,030 tonnes, with individual 
member allocations for this year as follows: 
o Australia – 5,265 tonnes; 
o Fishing Entity of Taiwan – 1,140 tonnes; 
o Japan – 6,065 tonnes; 
o New Zealand – 420 tonnes; 
o Republic of Korea – 1,140 tonnes. 
• A global allocation for cooperating non-members of 900 tonnes of which 800 
tonnes will be offered to Indonesia.  The remaining 100 tonnes is to accommodate 
other non-member countries including the Philippines. 
52. The Extended Commission acknowledged that there is an outstanding issue with 
respect to adjustment to national allocations as set out in the Mutual Understanding 
11 
reached at CCSBT 1.  The Extended Commission recognised that it needed to 
address and resolve this issue taking full account of the CCSBT Convention and the 
relevant principles in international law. 
53. The Extended Commission agreed that this issue should be resolved no later than 
CCSBT 11 in the context of future consideration of TAC, national allocations and 
decision rules for the management procedure. 
54. The Extended Commission invited New Zealand to prepare a paper in advance of 
CCSBT 11 exploring how the allocation principles reflected in the CCSBT 1 
Understanding might be accommodated given the current CCSBT environment, 
including the admission of two new members to the Extended Commission at 
CCSBT 9, and as the Extended Commission moves towards adopting a management 
procedure. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Quota trading 
55. Consideration was given to the quota trading paper (CCSBT-EC/0310/15) prepared 
by the Secretariat. 
56. The Extended Commission noted that this issued was very complex and that the 
legal implications are not clear.  It was agreed that further work needed to be 
undertaken and the Secretariat was directed to prepare a comprehensive review of 
the issue and circulate it to members for intersessional discussion.  The Secretariat 
should seek legal advice from all members and should also seek independent legal 
advice. 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
IUU fishing 
57. The Extended Commission considered the draft IUU resolutions contained in papers 
CCSBT-EC/0310/16 and CCSBT-EC/0310/25.  As a first step it was agreed to 
proceed with a resolution based on CCSBT-EC/0310/25 and the resolution agreed by 
the Extended Commission is at Attachment 10. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Trade Information Scheme matters 
58. The Executive Secretary presented the paper (CCSBT-EC/0310/17) on Trade 
Information Scheme (TIS) matters.  The focus of the paper was on minimum 
standards for the TIS.  
59. Australia and New Zealand expressed their desire to move towards a catch 
information/documentation scheme that was not restricted to trade related catch.  
Australia also advised that it would like members to be reporting their catch to the 
CCSBT on a monthly basis. 
12 
60. A working group was convened to discuss this agenda item.  The report of the 
working group is at Attachment 11, which includes: 
• Agreed minimum standards for the TIS; 
• A modification to the TIS to require export destination to be included on the TIS 
form; 
• Recommendations for improvements to the TIS. 
61. The report of the working group was adopted by the Extended Commission. 
62. The issue of monitoring all catch, including non-traded catch was discussed.  It was 
agreed that this was an emerging issue that the Extended Commission should address.  
The Secretariat was asked to prepare a report intersessionally on catch monitoring 
options. 
63. The Secretariat was also asked to investigate previous rules of the CCSBT on the 
requirements for monthly catch reporting by members. 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
64. A working group was convened to discuss this agenda item.  The Deputy Executive 
Secretary introduced paper CCSBT-EC/0310/18 relating to work programme 
arrangements for the 5th meeting of the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
(ERSWG), to be held in Wellington on 2-5 February 2004. 
65. Discussion centred on arrangements for assisting the Secretariat to deal with the 
volume of papers expected for the 5th ERSWG.  Members agreed, in general, to 
follow the protocols established by the Scientific Committee for submission of 
papers.  Specifically, members agreed to:  
• Provide the Secretariat with an electronic version of the list of papers each 
member wishes to submit for the 5th ERSWG meeting by no later than 19 
December 2003. This list should, where possible, include an abstract, an 
indication of the agenda item to which the paper relates and papers should be 
classified into one of four categories (background, information, national reports 
and meeting documents); 
• Submit to the Secretariat final papers in electronic form no later than two weeks 
prior to the meeting; 
• Appoint a single contact point for correspondence with the Secretariat regarding 
arrangements for the 5th ERSWG; and 
• Provide national reports in the form agreed at the 4th ERSWG meeting. 
66. Australia recalled the agreement reached at CCSBT9 that the Extended Commission 
should consider ways in which it can assist the goals of the FAO International Plans 
of Action on sharks and seabirds.  Members agreed that this item should be 
considered under item 3 of the agreed agenda for the 5th ERSWG. 
13 
67. Members agreed to encourage Indonesia’s participation in the 5th ERSWG meeting 
given the potential impact of Indonesia’s longline fishery on bycatch species. 
 
Agenda Item 16. 
Research Mortality Allowance 
68. The Chair of the Scientific Committee presented paper CCSBT-EC/0310/19. 
69. In the 2002/2003 fishing season, 0.8 tonnes of RMA had been used for the Japanese 
spawning ground survey, and 13.28 tonnes of SRP mortality allowance had been 
used for tagging programs. 
70. Ten tonnes of RMA was requested by Japan for the spawning ground survey in 
2003/04.  The Extended Commission approved this request. 
71. A total of 40 tonnes of SRP mortality allowance was requested and approved for 
SBT tagging programs, these being: 
• CCSBT surface fishery tagging (4t); 
• Japanese longline pilot tagging in the western Indian Ocean (10t); 
• Australian longline tagging pilot in the Australian east coast fishery and eastern 
Indian Ocean (15t); 
• Australian global archival tagging program (6t); 
• New Zealand longline tagging in the western Pacific Ocean (5t) 
 
Agenda Item 17. 
Program of work for 2004 
72. The Extended Commission agreed to the program of work for 2004 outlined at 
Attachment 12. 
 
Agenda Item 18. 
Activities with other organisations 
73. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/0310/20.  He proposed that in 
2004 the activities with other organisations would be limited to attendance at a 
meeting of Tuna Regional Fishery Bodies being organised by ICCAT.  The 
Extended Commission agreed that attendance at other organisation meetings in 2004

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Thank you Chairman. 
 
Let me begin by thanking New Zealand for hosting this, your first SBT meeting.  I 
would also like to welcome Stan Crothers as chairman of the tenth annual meeting of 
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and Andrew Penny as 
the chair of the Scientific Committee.   
 
It is always a pleasure to see the same interpreters and I would like to thank you in 
anticipation for your efforts over the next week.  Finally I thank the Secretariat for 
all the hard work they have undertaken over the last year to bring us to what I expect 
will be a very productive meeting. 
 
It is good to see all the members of Commission for the Conservation of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna are here today, as well as observers from the Philippines, Indonesia.  I 
hope that the Republic of South Africa will also join us this week.  Dealing with the 
issues associated with non-members and non-member catch is important in this 
forum.   
 
After coming from a very successful Preparatory Conference meeting of the Western 
and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission.  I hope the good will I witnessed at the 
Preparatory Conference is also present at this CCSBT meeting, enabling significant 
progress on the large number of important issues.    
 
There are a number of issues that Australia views as particularly important to progress 
at this, the tenth annual Commission meeting.  The development of the management 
procedure and management objectives is imperative to the future functioning of the 
Commission and deserves an appropriate amount of attention.  The inability of 
members to agree to a total allowable catch and national allocations has been a major 
hindrance to the effective functioning of the CCSBT, I hope that members work to 
reach a consensus on this issue at this meeting.  It is important that the members of 
the Commission work to manage non-member catch, especially of Indonesia 
considering its impact on the spawning stock.  I would also like to see members take 
the initiative at this meeting to make a strong statement to those countries outside of 
the Commission that engage in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing to the 
detriment of Commission members who make sacrifices to manage the species 
sustainably.  Taking into consideration the funds that all members have provided to 
the CCSBT tagging program, it is also important that members implement the desired 
observer coverage to ensure the tagging program achieves its goals. 
 
I look forward to a productive week.  Thank you. 
Attachment 4-2 
 
Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen: 
 
First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the 
Government of New Zealand for providing this excellent venue to hold our meeting.  
I would also like to extend our thanks to the Executive Secretary Mr. Brian 
Macdonald and all the Secretariat’s staff for their hard work to prepare all required 
documents to make this meeting possible. 
 
One year has passed rapidly since we acceded as a member of the Extended 
Commission last August.  Upon acceding, we know there are more burdens to be put 
on us for better management and conservation of SBT resource.  In order to take our 
obligations and comply all measures adopted, over the past years we have exerted 
more efforts on the management of our vessels fishing for SBT.  We appreciate the 
assistance rendered by all members during the period of past one year. 
 
The Extended Scientific Committee is exploring applicable proposals for further 
development of the CCSBT management procedure in order to introduce the guidance 
on management objectives for SBT fishery, and then decide total allowable catch as 
well as national allocation.  We agree in principle the exerted forward direction as a 
whole.  However, we are also concerned over the future concluded result whether it 
could be accepted by all members.  We respect all members’ efforts before our 
accession, but we would also like to draw all your attention to our sacrifice by 
voluntarily decreasing catch limit while acceding to the Extended Commission of 
CCSBT.  In order to avoid unnecessary arguments among members, the Extended 
Commission should explore the feasibility to establish a new mechanism for future 
national quota allocation.  We anticipate that all members are able to reach 
unanimity in this regard.  Even as such to modify the management objectives in the 
future, we would like to remind all participants here that the sustainable utilization of 
SBT resources shall be always the first priority to be taken into account.   
 
At the last meeting, the Extended Commission could not reach agreement with South 
Africa for its request to join the Extended Commission.  For the purpose of ensuring 
the conservation and optimum utilization of SBT, we welcome the coastal states, 
through whose exclusive economic or fishery zones SBT migrates or that exercise 
sovereign rights within such zones, to join the Extended Commission.  However, the 
catch limitation should be decided before the applicant comes into as a cooperating 
member.  We call for a compromising arrangement able to be reached among 
members and anticipate that a resolution to establish the status of cooperating 
non-member could be adopted as early as possible.  
 
In addition, there are a number of issues that we are concerned in this meeting, 
including IUU fishing, quota trading and Indonesian catch monitoring.  In particular, 
the target observer coverage of 10% revealed in the proposed Scientific Observer 
Program Standard draws our great concern.  The Extended Commission shall notice 
the great difference between deep-sea fisheries and coastal fisheries in the deployment 
of observer.  To achieve such a goal will be really a tough difficulty to deep-sea 
fishing nations.  We hope there remain rooms for flexibility on this issue.  
 
Finally, we look forward to working together with all members over the next few days 
and producing fruitful results from the meeting. 
 
Thank you. 
Attachment 4-3 
 
Opening Statement by Japan 
(Translated by the Secretariat) 
 
1. Thank you Chairman. 
 
I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Government of New Zealand and 
all staff who were in charge of the arrangements for the 10th annual meeting, 
which starts now successfully in scenic Christchurch. It has been nine years since 
the first Commission meeting was held in New Zealand. As this is the 10th 
meeting which is recognized as one chapter for the Commission, I therefore 
earnestly expect to make new progress in the conservation and management for 
SBT.  
 
2. In the past, we had the bitter experience of where different views on the stock 
assessment of SBT developed leading to the international tribunal case. However, 
this is past history and I am very glad that at present there is a mutual 
understanding between members and the functional improvement of the 
Commission has developed.  Specifically, I would point to the development of 
the framework and implementation of the Scientific Research Program (SRP), the 
improvement of stock assessment methods and the development of the 
management procedure. Although these functional improvements are due to 
members’ efforts, we must acknowledge the initiative of the independent scientists 
and independent chairs of the Scientific Committee and the Stock Assessment 
Group. I would like once again to express my appreciation for these initiatives. 
We also strongly support the conservation and sustainable utilization of SBT 
based science, and we must continue to make all efforts and cooperate with each 
other fully in the future.  
 
3. Regarding the management objectives, I have heard that there was remarkable 
progress during the 8th Meeting of the Scientific Committee. I think it is 
imperative that we give the appropriate directions to the Scientific Committee so 
that the Commission will be able to adopt the best management procedure at the 
next annual meeting in 2004. CCSBT10 is therefore a very important meeting for 
progressing  management methods. 
 
4. Regarding the TAC and its allocation, we have, unfortunately, not agreed in the 
Commission since 1998 and voluntary limits has been maintained. It is regrettable 
that in spite of virtual agreement on a global TAC last year, we could not quite 
agree on national allocations. We strongly believe that if we can make progress on 
management methods and actions towards non-members, which I will talk to next, 
it is possible to agree on TAC and its allocation. 
 
5. Regarding actions towards non-members, we recognize the increasing importance 
of them for proper implementation of SBT resource management. Some members 
have taken severe resource management measures and their industries have been 
required to make painful adjustments. On the other hand, countries outside the 
ambit of the CCSBT have increased their catch. This has brought about the 
situation where the non-members have offset the effects of the catch reductions by 
members, by increasing their catch. We believe that such a situation must be 
improved. We should develop immediately a system where only countries which 
cooperate in the framework of CCSBT, can be permitted to catch SBT, in order to 
achieve the effective conservation and management of SBT. For this reason, we 
need to adopt the resolution on cooperating non-member status and strive for the 
introduction of the IUU positive list measure. 
 
6. Lastly, I would like to express my gratitude to the Secretariat and the Government 
of New Zealand, which have made significant efforts in preparing for this meeting. 
The Japanese delegation hopes that this meeting will be a fruitful one and as a 
result, relationships between members and improvement in the CCSBT’s function 
will be further enhanced. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Good morning. It is our pleasure to welcome the members of the Extended 
Commission to Christchurch and we look forward to our discussions over the next 
few days. We are also very pleased to welcome the observers from Indonesia, South 
Africa and the Philippines and look forward to working closely with you to increase 
your involvement in this Commission.  . 
 
New Zealand is especially pleased to host this meeting which we think is of critical 
importance to the future of the Commission and the southern bluefin tuna fishery. A 
successful meeting will move the Commission forward onto a more effective and 
functional footing that delivers on the Convention’s primary objective of conservation 
and optimal utilisation of southern bluefin tuna. By this we mean an Extended 
Commission that: 
 
1) has well defined, scientifically credible management objectives,  
2) has an agreed management strategy to achieve its objectives,  
3) is acting in accordance with its management strategy and objectives and the 
Convention’s principles; and  
4) includes all states with a real interest in the SBT fishery. 
 
A Commission with these components would be world leading, one of the best 
regional fisheries management organisations in existence.  That is the challenge 
before us.   
 
As a Commission, we have achieved significant progress over the past few years.  
We have expanded our membership and we are confident that members will continue 
to work hard to bring all those with a real interest in the fishery into the CCSBT.  
Members have voluntarily held their catches at previously agreed levels.  We have 
also made credible progress in the science area. The development of the Scientific 
Research Programme has enjoyed the cooperative support of all members of the 
Extended Commission. The implementation of this Programme will allow us to base 
our management decisions on sound science. 
 
A key responsibility of this Commission is, however, to set a TAC for the SBT fishery 
and agree national allocations within this TAC.   Although New Zealand was 
encouraged by the progress made at our meeting last year in Canberra, we must now 
work hard to achieve consensus. The continued absence of a TAC hampers our ability 
to meet the Convention core objectives and to deal effectively with non-members and 
IUU fishing.   
 
We are confident that the management procedure being developed by the external 
scientists over the last couple of years will provide us with a robust process to set 
TACs in the future, consistently with the management objectives and decision rules 
we have set.  Consequently, New Zealand believes that a key component to restoring 
the Extended Commission to functionality will be the adoption of the management 
procedure.  It is now our duty, as an Extended Commission, to provide the political 
will to implement the management procedure we have asked the external scientists to 
develop. 
 
At this meeting the external scientists will be asking us for guidance on some key 
aspects of the management procedure. Some of this guidance will be scientific in 
nature. Some of it will need to draw on our fisheries management experience.  Some 
of it will also involve social and economic considerations.  We need to consider 
these questions very carefully as they relate closely to how this fishery will be 
managed in the future.   
 
A critical component to the development of the management procedures is the 
definition of a management objective for CCSBT. When the Commission was 
established we agreed that restoring the SSB to 1980 levels by 2020 was an 
appropriate management objective. The feeling at the time was that 1980 represented 
a time when recruitment in this fishery was stable. Critically at this time we did not 
agree on a management strategy or pathway that would realise our management 
objective.  New Zealand sees the adoption of the management procedure as 
providing us with such a strategy, a strategy to achieve our management objectives 
and assess our management performance against these objectives. The successful 
implementation of management procedures will benefit all of us. .  
 
New Zealand’s informal consultations over the past few months have revealed that 
some members feel we need to review the current management objectives for CCSBT.  
New Zealand is willing to discuss alternative management objectives with you over 
the next few days. We come with an open mind to these discussions. However, we are 
firmly of the view that any alternative management objectives we agree to must be 
scientifically robust, will lead to stock re-building, and are consistent with the 
Convention and the wider international legal regime. 
 
New Zealand strongly believes that we need to take the politics out of this 
Commission and stick to doing what we do best - managing fisheries. The most 
sensitive elements of the Extended Commission are the setting of TACs and national 
allocations.  It is through a management procedure, founded in science and giving 
due recognition to the principles contained in the Convention and in our guiding 
international legal instruments, that this Commission will be able to move to an 
agreed TAC setting process. By reaching consensus on the elements that are to be 
written in to a management procedure we will also be able to avoid protracted 
re-negotiation of national allocations every few years. 
 
Members of this Extended Commission are aware of New Zealand’s ongoing concern 
that the Convention’s allocation criteria, and the provisions of UNCLOS on coastal 
states’ rights, must be better taken into account before a management procedure can 
be settled.   This Commission foresaw, ten years ago at CCSBT1, that adjustments 
in Members’ relative proportions of the TAC would need to be made. That is still the 
case. We need to address this before relativities in catch levels become cemented in 
through a management procedure.  My delegation will return to this issue as our 
deliberations proceed in order to ensure that the Commission responds to the anomaly 
that exists in respect of New Zealand’s allocation. 
 
This meeting has a very full agenda ahead of it.  Many of the issues will be 
challenging to us all.  New Zealand is confident however that the members of this 
Extended Commission are ready to face up to these challenges, to take a longer term 
view of the future of this important fishery, to consolidate our management role, and 
to deliver in a meaningful way on our obligations under the Convention to which we 
are all signatories.   
 
I look forward to working constructively, and in a spirit of cooperation, with you all 
over the next few days. 
 
Thank you. 
 
 
Attachment 4-5 
 
Opening Statement by the Republic of Korea 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen.   
 
First of all, on behalf of the Korean delegation, let me say that I am pleased to 
participate in the 10th Session of the CCSBT.  The Korean delegation would like to 
express its utmost gratitude to the New Zealand authorities and the CCSBT 
Secretariat for its hard work in preparing this meeting. 
 
I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the CCSBT has performed an 
important role and has provided the highest example of conservation and management 
of tuna and tuna-like species, as one of the leading regional fisheries management 
organizations in the world. 
 
Korean Government has been successfully making sincere efforts to meet the 
objectives and principles of the CCSBT.  We know that the CCSBT has strived in 
every possible way to ensure the conservation and management of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna.   
 
Korean delegation would like to express its appreciation for the endeavors of the 
Stock Assessment Group in consolidating the Management Procedures, and we expect 
that the Procedures will be very helpful in utilizing the tuna resources. 
 
Korean Government also want to raise an international attention that control of IUU 
fishing vessels remains a major constraint on the management of tuna resources.  
Korea believes that concerted action will be the most efficient way to address IUU 
fishing in the CCSBT area.  Unless more determined efforts are made to speed it up, 
the IUU-elimination targets of the Convention will not be attained.  In this context, 
Korea believes immediate action is urgent and imperative to prevent stock collapse. 
 
And The Trade Information System (TIS) provides information that can be very 
helpful in identifying IUU fishing activities. 
 
Accordingly, the Korean delegation thinks that the CCSBT should consider adopting a 
more improved TIS system. 
 
With respect to quota allocation, we should keep in mind that allocation should be 
applied in a transparent, fair, equitable, and mutually agreeable manner.  At the same 
time, every State should be responsible in managing its catch until the work for the 
development of management procedure and stock assessment is completed in April 
2004. Upon the completion of the work, the global TAC should be established based 
on advice of the Scientific Committee. 
 
Korea have a deep interest in the conservation and management of the tuna stocks, 
and will make every effort to cooperate fully with the CCSBT. 
 
In closing, I hope that this meeting will be a very productive one. 
 
Thank you. 
 
Attachment 5-1 
 
Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
On the basis of the sustainable fisheries resources management, Indonesia has asked 
to the committee to be accepted as a cooperating non-member party. 
 
We have to admit that it is not that easy for such a big country to conduct a continuous 
monitoring activity. In this era of decentralization, in which the autonomy law was 
just launched in 1999, we would like to inform the meeting that it seems to be more 
difficult for the central government to get series of data from the local government. 
 
However, we have been taken some necessary actions to implement a better fisheries 
management which was conducted through the socialization of the Code of Conduct 
for Responsible Fisheries, application of tuna statistic and also fisheries statistics 
improvement. Considering the importance of fisheries statistic for the fisheries 
development policy, Indonesia has been improving the statistic methodology and data 
collection mechanism, that will be implemented throughout the nation, since couple 
of years ago. Indonesia is also fully aware of the importance of tuna landing data 
collected consistently. In this regard, the data collection mechanism has been 
modified by the inclusion of more detail fish species, such as southern bluefin tuna, 
bigeye tuna and others. 
 
In addition, in combating the IUU fishing practices, our government committed to 
alleviate the illegal fishing practices in Indonesian waters by imposing re-registration 
fishing vessels policy to any fishing operator entities and enforcing the said fisheries 
regulation. 
 
Lastly, I would like to inform the meeting that Indonesia now is in a process of 
revising our fisheries law and would cover, for instance, the regional cooperation 
matter, fisheries management plan and other important issues related to the important 
of local and regional cooperation towards fisheries management. 
 
Thank you 
Attachment 5-2 
 
Opening Statement by the Philippines 
 
My Delegation is happy to be here in Christchurch to participate in CCSBT 10. 
 
The Philippines, at this time, has a rather modest fishing industry and fishing effort. In 
the case of SBT fishing, the Philippines fishing industry became engaged in SBT 
fishing only in 1997 and as by-catch. As the Commission’s documents show, the 
Philippines, for the period 2002, caught only 45 tons as compared to the thousands on 
the part of individual “inaugural” participating States to the Convention. 
 
The Philippines is an archipelagic State that also hosts spawning grounds for other 
straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. It has a growing fishing industry that is 
fully supported by the Government as a significant aspect and component of its 
sustainable economic development program. In these circumstances, the Philippines 
cannot but be fully aware of the need for conservation and management measures for 
SBT. In this regard, the Philippines in the past few years has participated in an 
Observer capacity in the work of this Commission and, in an anticipatory manner, 
indicated its desire to apply for “Cooperating Non-Member” status as soon as such 
association category is approved by the Commission. It is especially concerned that 
the early manner and method that its fishing industry have been involved in CCSBT 
fishing has drawn suspicions that it is engaged in IUU fishing. 
 
In looking forward to a fresh involvement with the work of the Commission, the 
Philippines requests for the usual consideration and concessions granted developing 
countries that have been accepted and recognized in other Regional Fisheries 
Management Organizations, the fisheries agreements under the FAO, and in the 1982 
Law of the Sea Convention itself. 
 
In making the case for developing country concessions, it might be wise to refresh our 
perspectives in regard to the Convention. We must not forget the fact that the 
“inaugural” Participating States, at the time SBT fishing became big enough as to 
endanger the sustainability of this ocean resource and, for the matter, of the fishing 
effort itself, were themselves already economically-developed States with 
well-develop fishing capacity and industry. They ranged the high seas in exercise of 
the freedom to fish, among only a handful of internationally-recognized and accepted 
freedoms of the high seas. Also, we are talking about fish, sea creatures that were 
once so abundant as to be originally thought to be an inexhaustible resource. It was 
under this foregoing scenario that an exploitation free-for-all competition, to the 
detriment of the target-resource, began in the first place. 
 
At a later stage in the SBT exploitation process, another State and a fishing entity 
were allowed to join the Commission as participants. These two new members also 
had fully-developed economies and fishing industry and capacity. At this point, the 
Commission, in the name of conservation and sustainable SBT fishing, became a 
closed club of participating countries and entity. Outsiders wishing to join in, 
invariably developing economies, are almost treated as “gate crashers,” not exercising 
the freedom to fish in the high seas, but rather as villains out to deprive the 
participating States of their catch entitlement. 
 
In this light, Mr. Chair, I wish to close reiterating our request for special consideration 
and concessions for developing countries wishing to develop an SBT fishing industry. 
 
Thank you

RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH THE STATUS OF CO-OPERATING NON-
MEMBER OF THE EXTENDED COMMISSION AND THE EXTENDED 
SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
RECOGNISING that ensuring the sustainability of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) 
stock requires that all those States and entities fishing this species work together 
through the Extended Commission; 
 
CONSIDERING that continued fishing for SBT by States and entities not adhering 
to conservation and management measures adopted in accordance with the 
Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (the Convention) 
substantially diminishes the effectiveness of those measures; 
 
RECOGNISING, in accordance with Article 13 of the Convention and the 
Resolution to establish an Extended Commission and an Extended Scientific 
Committee (the Resolution), the continuing need for all members of the Extended 
Commission to co-operate with each other to encourage States to accede to the 
Convention and to encourage entities to apply for membership of the Extended 
Commission, and  
 
RECOGNISING the continuing need to encourage all non-member States and 
entities whose fishing vessels harvest SBT or through whose exclusive economic or 
fishery zone SBT migrates to take appropriate actions to ensure the effectiveness of 
conservation and management measures and all other decisions adopted in accordance 
with the Convention; 
 
Decides as follows: 
 
1.  The Extended Commission hereby establishes the status of “co-operating non-
member” of the Extended Commission and the Extended Scientific Committee. 
 
2.  The Executive Secretary of the Extended Commission is instructed to invite every 
year all non-member States and entities whose fishing vessels harvest SBT or through 
whose exclusive economic or fishery zone SBT migrates to co-operate with the 
Commission by acceding to the Convention or, as the case requires, by becoming a 
member of the Extended Commission or applying to the Extended Commission for 
the status of a co-operating non-member. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
Any State or entity that receives such an invitation may apply to the Extended 
Commission to be admitted in the capacity of a Cooperating Non-Member to 
the Extended Commission. Any applications for such admission should be 
received by the Executive Secretary of the Extended Commission at least one 
hundred and twenty (120) days before the Annual Meeting of the Extended 
Commission. 
 
4. 
When submitting an application for admission in the capacity of a Cooperating 
Non-Member, the candidate State or entity will give a formal written 
statement to the Extended Commission of its commitment to: 
a. 
carry out the objective of the Convention; 
b. 
abide by conservation and management measures and all other 
decisions and resolutions adopted in accordance with the Convention; 
c. 
take appropriate action to ensure that its fishing activities do not 
diminish the effectiveness of conservation and management measures 
and all other decisions adopted in accordance with the Convention; 
d. 
transmit to the Extended Commission the review of its SBT fisheries 
and all other data that the members of the Extended Commission are 
required to submit to the Extended Commission; 
e. 
facilitate scientific research and studies of SBT; 
f. 
ensure that SBT statistical documents are completed in accordance 
with requirements of the Commission’s Trade Information Scheme; 
and 
g. 
negotiate with the members of the Extended Commission to develop 
any other criteria for its admission in the capacity of a Cooperating 
Non-Member specific to its situation. 
 
5. 
In deciding upon a total allowable catch and its allocation the Extended 
Commission may negotiate catch limits for  Cooperating Non-Members.  
Cooperating Non-Members shall abide by any negotiated limit.  
 
6. 
The commitments in paragraph 4(a) to (f), and any specific criteria determined 
by the Extended Commission in negotiation with the applicant in accordance 
with 4(g), will form the basis of an Exchange of Letters between the applicant 
and the Extended Commission.  Upon conclusion of the Exchange of Letters 
the applicant will be admitted in the capacity of a “Cooperating Non-Member” 
of the Extended Commission.  The Cooperating Non-Member will reaffirm 
the commitments contained in the Exchange of Letters at the Annual Meetings 
of the Extended Commission. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7.  A State or entity that is admitted to the Extended Commission in the capacity of a 
co-operating non-member will have the right to participate actively in meetings of the 
Extended Commission, the Extended Scientific Committee and their subsidiary 
bodies, including, but not limited to, the right to make proposals and the right to speak, 
but not to vote.  The Extended Commission may decide to restrict the participation of 
a cooperating non-member in a particular Agenda item. 
 
8.  At its Annual Meeting the Extended Commission will determine whether the State 
or entity qualifies to retain the status of co-operating non-member.  The Extended 
Commission will evaluate the performance of the co-operating non-member against 
the commitments set out in its Exchange of Letters with the Extended Commission. 
 
9.  If the Extended Commission determines that a co-operating non-member has not 
fulfilled its commitments the Extended Commission may proceed in accordance with 
the 2000 Action Plan, or take other appropriate steps. 
 
10.  The Executive Secretary is instructed to inform any non-member State or entity 
whose fishing vessels harvest southern bluefin tuna in a manner that undermines the 
conservation and management measures adopted in accordance with the Convention, 
or that fails to ensure that SBT statistical documents are completed in accordance with 
the requirements of the Trade Information Scheme, and that does not seek full 
membership of the Convention, membership of the Extended Commission or co-
operating non-member status, that continuing to allow such activities to take place, 
undermines the objective of the Convention.  
 
11.  The Rules of Procedure of the Extended Commission are amended by inserting 
the following: 
 
“RULE 3 A bis 
CO-OPERATING NON-MEMBERS 
A State or entity that is admitted to the Extended Commission in the capacity of a co-
operating non-member will have the right to participate actively in meetings of the 
Extended Commission, the Extended Scientific Committee and their subsidiary 
bodies, including, but not limited to, the right to make proposals and the right to speak, 
but not to vote.  The Extended Commission may decide to restrict the participation of 
a cooperating non-member in a particular Agenda item.” 
 
Attachment 8-1 
 
Update of the Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery  
for the 2001-02 Season,  
 
 
1. 
Introduction 
 
The Australian Domestic SBT catch for the 2001-02 quota year (1 December 2001 to 30 November 
2002) was 5262 tonnes. 
 
2. 
Operational Constraints on Catch 
 
Regulatory Measures 
Domestic operations are managed through individual transferable quotas (ITQs) granted as statutory 
Fishing Rights (SFRs) under the Southern Bluefin Tuna Management Plan 1995.  Although the 
global total allowable catch (TAC) has not been determined by the Commission since 1998, 
Australia agreed to maintain its national catch limit at 5265 tonnes, which has remained unchanged 
since 1989-90. 
 
Australia continued with restricted access arrangements to reduce the incidental catch of SBT in the 
domestic longline fishery.  Longline fishers that did not hold adequate quota to cover incidental 
catch of SBT in areas of high abundance were prohibited from fishing in such areas.  Those 
operators who were granted access were subject to a range of additional monitoring and compliance 
conditions including Vessel Monitoring Systems, and observer coverage.   
 
3. 
Catch and Effort 
 
The SBT landings for 2001-02 were: 
 
South Australia   
 
5234 tonnes (farmed) 
 
New South Wales,  
 
22 tonnes (longline) 
Tasmania and Queensland 
 
Western Australia 
 
7 tonnes (longline) 
 
SBT caught for fish farms in South Australia, using purse seine vessels, utilised 99.5% of the 
Australian quota, with the remainder taken by longline.  There were no SBT poled off South 
Australia or trolled off Tasmania during either season.  The Australian catch by gear and state for 
the quota years 1988-89 to 2001-02 is shown in Table 1.  The Australian catch of SBT in calendar 
years 2001 and 2002 is mapped on Figures 1 & 2 respectively. 
 
4. 
Historical Catch and Effort 
 
Major restructuring occurred in Australia’s SBT fisheries following reductions in the global TAC 
and national catch allocations in the 1980s.  Table 1 provides a summary of catch taken by each 
sector of the Australian industry since 1998-89.  Confidentiality guidelines prevent the release of 
data from groups of less than 5 boats, therefore data are combined for some fishing methods. 
 
5. 
Annual Fleet Size and Distribution 
 
In 2001–02, a total of 56 commercial fishing vessels landed SBT in Australian waters.  
South Australia 
The one- to five-year-old SBT, which school from late spring to autumn in surface waters of the 
eastern Great Australian Bight, were fished by seven purse seiners during the 2001-02 quota year, 
but various live bait, pontoon-towing and feeding vessels were also involved.  Fishing 
commenced in late December 2001 and finished in March 2002.  No longline vessel reported 
taking SBT from these waters during 2001-02.  
Western Australia  
Thirteen longline vessels caught SBT seasonally off the WA coastline in 2001–02.  
New South Wales 
During 2001–02, 17 domestic longliner vessels participated in the fishery for older juveniles and 
adults in deeper waters off NSW in winter.  Longline fishing off NSW commenced in May 2001 
and finished in November 2001.  
Tasmania 
Only two longline vessels operated during the 2001–02 quota year because of the limited 
availability of quota.  For confidentiality reasons all catches are incorporated in the NSW longline 
catch. 
Queensland 
Two longline vessels operated during the 2001-02 quota year.  For confidentiality reasons all 
catches are incorporated in the NSW longline catch. 
 
6. 
Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
 
Australians began fishing SBT in the early 1950s off New South Wales and South Australia and 
then later (1970) off Western Australia.  The catch peaked at 21 500 tonnes in 1982.  Historically, 
the bulk of the Australian catch had been used for canning. 
 
Progressively over the mid to late 1980s, the Australian catch focused on supplying the Japanese 
sashimi market, with an increasing amount of the catch being transhipped to Japanese freezer 
vessels in the Great Australian Bight. 
 
The introduction of an ITQ based management plan in 1984 based on an Australian TAC of 14 500 
tonnes resulted in the redistribution of quota ownership.  In the late 1980s the Australian quota 
reductions to 5265 tonnes led to further restructuring.  From 1990 to 1994 approximately half the 
Australian quota was taken by Australian-Japan joint venture longliners.  With the termination of 
the joint venture arrangements in 1995 Australian catches again focused on the surface fishery with 
poling operations supplying the fresh chilled sashimi market and purse seiners providing SBT to 
farms. 
 
Since 1992 there has been a progressive increase in the number of SBT taken under farming 
operations.  In the 2001-02 season this component utilised over 99% of the Australian quota. 
 
7. 
Fisheries Monitoring 
 
There are a series of logbooks and associated catch records that are required by law to be completed 
by fishers and fish receivers and sent to AFMA for the purposes of monitoring, compliance and 
research.  The type of form used is dependent on the type of method used to catch SBT in the 
fishery.  All of the data provided from Logbooks and Catch Disposal Records must be supplied to 
AFMA within specified time periods specific to each record.  Validation of this data is undertaken 
as a minimum on an annual basis through an audit process by AFMA compliance staff, and 
sometimes on a needs basis.  The monitoring arrangements in the SBT fishery continue to be 
reviewed and refined in order to improve monitoring and compliance. 
 
Catch Disposal Records 
Catch disposal records for SBT are for recording SBT taken by fishers for the purposes other than 
farming and are signed by the fishing concession holder and the first receiver immediately after 
unloading the catch.  Catch disposal records provide a means to verify logbook data. 
 
Australian Daily Fishing Log and Farm Transit Log 
A Logbook form is required to be completed by fishers when using pelagic longlining or when 
fishing with minor line methods.  In the purse seine fishery the Master of the catcher vessel (with 
quota assigned) is required to complete the Australian Purse Seine and Pole Daily Fishing Log – for 
farmed SBT only.  A specific permit called the Farm Transit Log is completed by the holder of the 
SBT carrier boat permit or representative, and provided to the monitoring company which 
undertakes the fish count when fish are transferred from tow cages to farm cages. 
 
Farm Disposal Record 
A specific process has been designed to obtain data to allow for research and monitoring from 
farming operations.  An independent company is contracted annually by AFMA to monitor the 
farming operations.  All mortalities that occur during the capture and towing operations must be 
recorded on the appropriate form and must be available for inspection if requested by an AFMA 
officer. 
 
When SBT are transferred from tow cages to the fish farms, a video record must be carried out by 
the AFMA contracted monitoring company.  The video recording is then used to undertake a count 
of the fish that are transferred into the fish farm.  This count of captured fish will be multiplied by 
the average fish weight (derived from a 40 fish sample) and decremented from quota using the Farm 
Disposal Record.  During the 1999-00, 2000-01 and 2001-02 season AFMA Compliance Officers 
were deployed on farm tow vessels to observe procedures and protocols. 
 
Observer Programmes  
Observer programmes for the purse seine and longline sectors were implemented in the 2002-2003 
fishing season and achieved greater than 10 percent coverage of catch and effort.  
 
Seasonal Area Restrictions 
To minimise the risk of non-quota take of SBT by longliners off New South Wales and Western 
Australia, access to the waters through which SBT migrate has been restricted to vessels holding 
SBT quota since 2000 in NSW and 2001 in WA. 
 
8. 
Other Factors 
Import/Export Statistics 
The Trade Information Scheme (TIS) that records all exported Australian fish has been 
implemented and refined.  A TIS form is completed by an authorised signatory from the 
export-registered establishment that is the last to handle the consignment before the product leaves 
Australia and validated by a Government officer.  The form is used for both farmed and 
non-farmed SBT.  This program provides a complete record of SBT exports that can be compared 
with the Japanese Import Statistics. 
Markets 
More than 95% of Australia’s SBT catch is exported to Japan

Review of Taiwan’s SBT Fishery of 2002/2003  
1. INTRODUCTION 
Taiwan has traditionally been fishing for southern bluefin tuna (SBT) 
since 1970s.  The SBT was caught partly by seasonal directed fishery and 
partly by albacore/bigeye fisheries as a by-catch.  Seasonal directed fishery 
was conducted mainly by longliners equipped with super cold freezers, fishing 
in two seasons, i.e. one from June to September and the other from October to 
February of the next year, in the waters around 35°S.  However, no 
year-round directed fishing has yet been exerted.  The annual catch in 2002 
was preliminarily estimated to be 1,137 M.T. 
2. OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON EFFORT 
Regulatory Measures 
Taiwan has become a member of the Extended Commission of CCSBT in 
2002, and agreed to national catch limit of 1,140 M.T.  About 71% of the 
annual catch was allocated to the seasonal directed fishery vessels while 29% 
to the by-catch vessels.  Each vessel is required to register with the tuna 
association either for directed or by-catch fishery, and subsequently approved 
by the government before catching SBT. 
In order to collect SBT catch information promptly and to manage the 
total SBT catch within the voluntary catch limit of SBT, every vessel that has 
caught SBT was required to report weekly it’s catches of SBT in weight and 
fishing location (Weekly Report) to the Fisheries Authorities since 1996.  
This system has been refined in 2002 to obtain more accurate catch 
information including the length measurement of each fish caught.  Taiwan 
has undertaken issuing of SBT Statistical Document to export of SBT from 
June 2000 to comply with the requirement of TIS （ Trade Information 
Scheme）.  All vessels fishing for SBT are also required to be equipped with 
VMS (Vessel Monitoring System) for providing the vessel location to the 
monitoring center since 2002.  Fishing in spawning area of SBT is prohibited 
and document of TIS will not be issued to any catch from such area to protect 
the spawning stock.   
 
 
3. CATCH AND EFFORT 
The annual catch in 2002 was preliminarily estimated to be 1,137 M.T.  
by about 60 vessels including seasonal target and by-catch fishery.  There 
are 152 vessels registered as seasonal directed and by-catch fishery in 2003.  
4. HISTORICAL CATCH AND EFFORT 
In the early of 1980s, annual catches of SBT were relatively small, less 
than 250 M.T.  With continuously expanding fleet size of tuna longliners, 
development of deep sea longline fishery and expansion of fishing grounds, 
increase in annual catches was prominent.  Between 1989 and 1992, greater 
increase of SBT catch was observed, where drift net fishery accounted for 
about 1/4 of the catches.  With the prohibition of drift net fishery since 1993 
in compliance with UNGA (United Nations Gillnet Agreement) resolution, the 
catch of SBT returned to a stable level, fluctuating between 800 and 1,600 
M.T during the last decade (Table 1).  
5. ANNUAL FLEET SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION 
In 2002, there were about 60 longline vessels catching SBT.  Their fishing 
grounds were mainly in the waters of 20°S - 40°S, seasonally distributed in 
the southern and central Indian Ocean during June to September, and in the 
southern and western Indian Ocean extending to the eastern limit of the 
Atlantic Ocean during October to February of the following year.  
6. HISTORICAL FLEET SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION 
SBT was caught only by longline fishery after 1992 in the three oceans, with 
more concentration in the Indian Ocean.  According to the weekly reports and 
trader’s information, about 140 deep sea longliners landed SBT during 1998-2002, 
and most of them were operating in the Indian Ocean.  
 
7. FISHERIES MONITORING 
 
 
Intensive efforts have been exerted for better understanding and monitoring the 
fishery, for example, the implementation of TIS to collect more updated and detailed 
catch information.  Provision of daily records, including catch, position and discards, 
in the updated Weekly Report has been required for obtaining the SBT statistical 
document since 2002.  In addition, from April 2002, it is mandatory for the vessels 
that catch SBT to be equipped with VMS in order to monitor activities of the vessels. 
8. OTHER FACTORS 
Import/Export Statistics 
The trade Information Scheme that records all exported Taiwanese fish has been 
implemented. This program provides a complete record of SBT exports that can be 
compared with the Japanese Import Statistics. 
Markets 
SBT is mainly exported to Japan for its sashimi market.  In order to promote 
SBT in domestic market, the Fisheries Agency is trying to encourage the Taiwan 
Tuna Association arranging to ship SBT caught by its member back to Taiwan.  Due 
to being lack of sufficient super cold storage and low domestic consumption, the 
quantity is still in low level in the year of 2002.  However, the Fisheries Agency and 
tuna industries are reviewing all elements required for its domestic market, and will 
continue the promotion of domestic consumption.

Review of Southern Bluefin Tuna Fisheries of Japan in the 2003 Fishing Season 
(Provisional since the 2003 fishing season has not completed.) 
 
1.  Introduction 
(1) The total amount of catch of SBT for the 2003 fishing season ( 1 March 2003 - 28 
February 2004) was 4,641tons at 20 September 2003. 
(2) Japanese distant-water tuna longline fishery has been facing a severe economic 
situation due to a fall in the price of tuna caused by a decline in demand for tuna 
because of the long recession in Japan and the continued high level of import of tuna. 
 
2. Operational Constraints on Effort 
(1) GOJ is managing the catch of SBT for each fishing season based on TAC and 
national allocations agreed by CCSBT. 
(2) Fishing operations for the 2003 fishing season have been started with catch limit of 
5,839tons, which is reduced 226tons from a tentative catch limit of 6,065tons, since no 
agreement was reached for this season. 
(3) Further, GOJ is managing the fishing operations by introducing the time/area closure 
in order to protect the spawning grounds and juveniles. 
(4) The industry sets voluntary starting days for three sub-fishing areas (high seas area 
off Tasmania/Sydney, high seas area off Cape Town and Southern Indian Ocean), and 
limits the total number of vessels for each sub-fishing area. 
 
3. Catch and Effort (refer to Appendix 1) 
In the 2003 fishing season, the fishing operations in the high seas area off 
Tasmania/Sydney and off Cape Town have been closed with the catch of 1,556tons by 
53 vessels and 2,836tons by 106 vessels (1 vessels within 107 vessels which had been 
selected for targeting SBT did not operate), respectively. The operations in the Southern 
Indian Ocean are still undertaken. 
 
4. Historical Catch and Effort (refer to Appendix 1) 
 (1) In the 1999 fishing season, GOJ originally took the same voluntary measures as for 
the 1998 fishing season, in the absence of a decision on TAC by the Commission.  
However, following the prescription of provisional measures by ITLOS concerning the 
experimental fishing conducted by Japan, the actual catch in the 1999 season was 
reduced by 711tons to 5,354tons. 
(2) In the 2000 fishing season, GOJ set the voluntary catch limit of 4,578tons, 1,487tons 
less than 6,065tons, which was the national allocation to Japan agreed in 1997. 
However, since the provisional measures prescribed by ITLOS was revoked in August 
2000, the voluntary catch limit was changed to 6,065tons in September 2000. The 
actual catch in the 2000 season was 6,027tons. 
(3) In the 2001 fishing season, fishing operations were started with a tentative catch limit 
of 6,065tons and GOJ set the voluntary catch limit of 6,421tons after the consultation 
with the relevant Members. The actual catch in the 2001 season was 6,647tons. 
(4) In the 2002 fishing season, fishing operations were started with a tentative catch 
 
 
limit of 6,065tons, and the actual catch was 6,192tons. 
 
5. Annual Fleet Size and Distribution (refer to Appendix 1) 
The number of fishing vessels selected for targeting SBT in the 2003 fishing season 
was 221. The number of vessels on the high seas off Tasmania/Sydney was 53, the 
number of vessels on the high seas off Cape Town was 10699 (1 of which did not 
operate), and the number of vessels in Southern Indian Ocean was 63. 
 
6. Historical Fleet Size and Distribution (refer to Appendix 1) 
(1) Until the end of the 1998 fishing season, 257 fishing vessels operated for each year. 
(2) In the 1999 fishing season, 227 fishing vessels ( 30 vessels less than the 1998 fishing 
seasons) operated, since Japan cut the number of distant-water tuna longliners based on 
the Plan of Action agreed by FAO. 
(3) In the 2000 fishing season, the number of vessels for SBT was reduced to 172 in 
accordance with the reduction of the catch limit based on the provisional measures 
prescribed by ITLOS. However, since the provisional measures were revoked, 199 
vessels, 27 vessels more than the original, operated for SBT based on the increase of 
the catch limit in September. 
(4) In the 2001 and 2002 fishing season, the number of vessels for SBT was restored to 
the 1999 fishing season level, which was 227. 
 
7. Fisheries Monitoring 
(1) GOJ issued a notification to the industry that SBT catch should be reported every 
10days for the management of the catch limit. 
(2) GOJ took necessary measures to control and monitor the fishery, which include 
dispatching enforcement vessels to the fishing area, observers on board of operating 
vessels, as well as requirement for fishing vessels to install VMS on board vessels and 
to report a daily position to GOJ. 
(3) In the 2003 fishing season, 3 enforcement vessels were/will be dispatched to the 
fishing ground, and the number of observers to monitor the operation on board 
were/will be 16. 
 
8. Others factors (refer to Appendix 2 for Japanese import of SBT) 
(1) From 1993 to 1998, the amount of SBT imported to Japan had significantly increased. 
Since 1998, the amount of SBT import has been stable at around just over 10,000tons 
(product weight). 
(2) The amount of import of SBT in 2002 was 10,866tons (product weight). The number 
of import country was reduced to 8, and import from the biggest 5 exporting 
country/entities (1: Australia, 2: Taiwan, 3: Republic of Korea, 4: New Zealand, 5: 
Indonesia) accounts for 97.7% of the total. 
(3) Import from Australia, the biggest exporting country/area of SBT to Japan has 
increased its export of SBT steadily, reaching 8,237tons (product weight) in 2001.  
This amount of SBT accounts for 75.8% of the total import of SBT to Japan.

*Notes：
  Imported SBT from China is originally captured by Japanese vessel and then processed at the factory in China which owned by 
Japanese company then reimported to Japan.The factory mentioned above was located in the Special Tariff area, therefore these 
imported tuna is treated specially on tax(reduction of taxes). From the China’s point of view, these case is not the import from 
Japanneither exported to Japanfrom China, so Japan accepts this case without any TIS document.

Review of New Zealand SBT Fisheries for the 10th Annual CCSBT Meeting 
 
 
1.  Introduction 
Since the start of the domestic SBT fishery handline, trolling and longline have been used to 
target SBT in the EEZ. In recent years nearly all of the SBT catch has been by surface longline 
with small catches by trolling. The domestic fishery is composed of a wide range of vessel types 
including many small owner-operated boats and 4–5 low temperature Japanese distant water 
longliners chartered by a New Zealand company. Both the chartered vessels and the New Zealand 
owner-operated vessels fish competitively against New Zealand’s SBT catch allocation. 
 
Fishing for SBT in 2001/02 was primarily conducted off the west coast of the South Island and 
along the east coast of the North Island between 37º and 42º S. In 2001/02 SBT catches exceeded 
our national allocation of 420 t. with landings post-closure of the season (midnight 20 June 2002) 
resulting in a total annual catch of 452 t, an over catch of 32 t. To compensate for the over-catch 
of national allocation in 2001/02, New Zealand reduced its SBT catch limit to 387 t for 2002/03 . 
The SBT fishing season was closed 28 June 2003 (midnight) and the final catch in 2002/03 was 
388 t. 
 
2.  Operational Constraints on Effort 
Voluntary measures 
Since 1994 the New Zealand fishing industry has implemented voluntary measures with respect to 
longline fishing that are detailed in a “Code of Practice”. Specific measures include gear 
specifications, environmental standards, operational practices and closed areas. The intent of the 
measures is to minimize: 
• 
bycatch (eg of seabirds and marine mammals); 
• 
catch of SBT smaller than 20 kg; 
• 
impacts on other domestic tuna fisheries, and 
• 
gear conflict among SBT longline vessels. 
Other measures that are used but not part of the “Code of Practice” include catch limits by area, 
changing areas when bird bycatch reaches a specific level, using multiple “tori” lines and longer 
lines than specified in regulations, night-setting, and the use of pneumatic “bird-scaring” cannons. 
 
Regulatory measures 
New Zealand continues to impose the previously agreed national catch limit of 420 tonnes (whole 
weight). This catch limit is a competitive limit among all license holders. Regulations specify the 
annual catch limit and make it an offence to take SBT once the catch limit has been reached. The 
catch limit applies within and outside New Zealand fisheries waters for the “fishing year” which 
extends from 1 October to 30 September. In the few years when the catch limit has been 
exceeded, it has been reduced in the following year by an equivalent amount. 
 
Until midway through the 2000/01 fishing season the SBT quota has applied to the catch of both 
southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) and Pacific bluefin tunas (formerly Thunnus thynnus, 
now recognized as Thunnus orientalis). The quota restriction on Pacific bluefin tuna was removed 
late in the 2000/01 SBT season when it was demonstrated that Pacific bluefin could be readily 
distinguished from SBT in catches based on morphological characteristics. SBT landings reported 
prior to June 2001 distinguished between northern and southern bluefin despite the fact the 
catches of both were counted against the SBT quota.  Catches reported as northern bluefin were 
most likely Pacific bluefin.  The quota restriction on northern bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) was 
removed in 2002. 
 
 
2
New Zealand is engaged in consultations with stakeholder groups to introduce SBT and other 
highly migratory fish species into the Quota Management System (QMS). SBT is currently 
scheduled for introduction into the QMS on 1 October 2004. 
 
3.  Catch and Effort 
Table 1 gives the estimated SBT catch by gear type since 1990 and clearly shows that since this 
time the New Zealand SBT fishery has essentially been a longline fishery. Longline effort now 
dominates the fishery and catches by handline and trolling are negligible components. Total SBT 
catches are summarised by calendar year and fishing year (1 October to 30 September) in Table 2. 
Figure 1 shows the effort trend (in millions of hooks) for the longline fishery from 1989 to 2002, 
the most recent complete year of processed data.  It is clear from this figure that total domestic 
longline effort, measured in millions of hooks, has increased exponentially since the early 1990s. 
The increase in effort is attributable to the growing number of New Zealand owned and operated 
longliners that primarily target bigeye tuna. In contrast, the longline effort targeting SBT has been 
stable since 1989 (average = 1.4 million hooks per year). The total number of longline hooks set 
each year is now slightly more than 10 million and sets targeting SBT account for about 20% of 
all longline effort.  
 
4.  Historical Catch and Effort 
Figure 2 shows the trend in SBT nominal CPUE since 1980 by fleet. The foreign licensed fleet 
CPUE shows a decline throughout the period fished except in 1985, 1990 and 1995, the last year 
when the fleet fished in the EEZ. CPUE for the chartered fleet (beginning in 1989) and the 
domestic owner-operator fleet (beginning in 1991) are highly variable. Nominal CPUE 
throughout the 1990s is not regarded as a very good indicator of abundance because of changes in 
operational practices and areas fished by each fleet. 
 
5.  Annual Fleet Size and Distribution 
The New Zealand longline fleet has broadened its area of operation and now fishes most areas of 
the east and west coasts of both the North and South Islands. The total number of longliners 
fishing in 2002 was 156 vessels, 67% of which were small longliners (< 50 GRT). This represents 
an additional 24 longliners fishing in 2002 relative to 2001 and a slight decrease in the proportion 
of smaller longliners < 50 GRT. 
 
SBT target fishing by longline primarily occurs off the west coast of the South Island and along 
the east coast of the North Island. SBT also comprises a significant bycatch in the bigeye target 
fishery in the Bay of Plenty but is also targeted by domestic owned and operated vessels primarily 
between 37º and 42º S. Figure 3 shows the position of all longline sets targeting SBT in 2001/02 
(charter and owner-operator vessels combined). 
 
6.  Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
The New Zealand SBT fishery began off the west coast of the South Island as a winter small boat 
handline and troll fishery in the early 1980s. These methods have comprised only a minor 
component of the fishery since 1990. During the 1980s to mid-1990s most longlining was 
conducted by foreign licensed longliners from Japan. However, declining catch rates, shortened 
seasons of availability and reports of increased operating costs in the EEZ resulted in the foreign 
licensed fleet ceasing operations in 1995. Domestic longlining began in 1991 and has steadily 
increased up to at least 2002, although most effort is not targeted at SBT. The change in vessel 
numbers and in vessel size composition is shown in Figure 4. The change in vessel numbers is 
essentially linear since 1989.

7. Fisheries Monitoring 
Observer coverage 
Observer coverage has been 100% in the charter fleet for several years. However, the small size 
of domestic owned and operated vessels and short trips has made it difficult for the Ministry of 
Fisheries (MFish) to realise the 10% target for observer coverage in this fleet.  As a consequence, 
observer coverage has typically been low. However, a target of 10% observer coverage for this 
fleet and 100% coverage for the charter fleet has been agreed. Coverage during the 2001/02 
fishing year resulted in 29 % of all longline hooks set targeting SBT observed (95% of hooks in 
the Charter fleet and 6% of domestic owner-operator vessels. Realignment of MFish observer 
allocation should result in continued improvements in coverage of domestic owned and operated 
longline vessels. Observer coverage on vessels using handline or trolling is not planned because 
the contribution of these methods to the total catch is negligible. 
RTMP coverage 
MFish operates an in-season catch monitoring system for SBT. This system requires that on-shore 
processing companies and freezer vessels (including all of the chartered fleet) report their catch 
by e-mail or fax during the season to MFish. Weekly reporting is required once 25% of the catch 
allocation is reached and daily reporting is required when 50% of the catch allocation has been 
reached. Reports are collated and analysed by MFish with the season being closed as close as 
possible to reaching our national allocation. All SBT permit holders are then notified that the 
season is closed and that it would be an offence to take southern bluefin tuna for the remainder of 
the fishing year.  
Biological information 
Observers from the MFish Scientific Observer Programme are responsible for collecting 
biological data on SBT and bycatch data for catch characterisation. In 2001/02, otoliths were 
collected from 1203 SBT and observers recovered 11 tags (10 CSIRO tags and 1 Japanese tag). 
Otoliths are stored at NIWA and tag recovery data were provided to the tagging agency. Length, 
weight (both processed and whole weights) and sex are recorded regularly for SBT and all major 
fish bycatch species. In total stomach contents were collected from over 2322 SBT and 3004 SBT 
were measured. 
 
8. Other Factors 
Import/export statistics 
Statistics on the export of SBT are compiled by Customs and summarized by the Department of 
Statistics. Export statistics are further summarized by the New Zealand Seafood Industry Council 
and maintained as a database for economic evaluations of New Zealand fisheries. 
Markets 
The only market for SBT caught in the EEZ is the Japanese sashimi market and all fish of suitable 
quality are exported. Domestic consumption is negligible. 
Mitigation 
New Zealand regulations specify that all tuna longline vessels shall use seabird-scaring devices 
(“tori-lines”). The minimum standard for “tori lines” is the same as specified by CCAMLR. The 
domestic fishing industry has a voluntary code of practice advocating night setting for all tuna 
longlining and for the large tuna longline vessels a limit on total incidental mortality of “at risk” 
seabirds has been set. 
Recreational and Indigenous Catches of SBT 
Recreational fishing for SBT is limited. There are records of recreational catch from both the 
North and South islands.  Historical catches may well have been higher.  There are no estimates 
of SBT catches by Maori non-commercial fishing.

Annual Review of Korea’s SBT Fisheries for the Annual Commission Meeting 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) fishery is the most recently developed tuna fishery by Korean distant-water 
fishing industry since the early 1990s. The SBT catch made by Korean fleet reached a maximum in 1998, 
followed by continuous decrease until recent years. This was mainly due to the voluntary regulation of 
fleet size by Korean fishing companies to implement the resolution adopted by CCSBT. However, the 
shift of Korean longliners from the Indian to the Pacific Ocean aiming to higher profit from fishery also 
contributed to the decrease in catch of this species. In recent years, this phenomenon was more often than 
in the past.  
 
2. Operational Constraints on Effort 
To implement the recommendations adopted by CCSBT, Korea has introduced its domestic regulations. 
Those are minimum size limit for Southern Bluefin tuna. With a view to protecting spawning stock of 
southern bluefin tuna. 
 
3. Catch and Effort 
In 2002, 10 out of 16 registered longliners made a catch of 649 mt SBT in the usual fishing area, showing 
a decrease by about 18% from 2001 figure. This may be due to the decrease in fishing effort (i.e. month) 
of some longliners. 
 
4. Historical Catch and Effort 
Fishing season of Korean SBT longline fishery usually starts in March and ends by November or 
December. Thus, fisheries statistics are collected and reported for a calendar year. In the first half of 
fishing season from March to July or August, usually Korean longliners are fishing in the high seas of the 
western Indian Ocean off South Africa, with occasional expanded operation to the southeastern Atlantic, 
while in the second half they move to the eastern Indian Ocean off the western Australia. This fishing 
pattern and fishing grounds have rarely been changed for the past 10 years of fishing history for SBT 
except for 1991, but in 2002 some catches were also taken from the western fishing grounds until October 
(Table 1, 2).  
. 
5. Annual Fleet Size and Distribution 
Korean fleet size have been regulated by the voluntary among fishing industries from 1998 and annual 
fleet size for SBT fishery never exceeded 16 registered number since then which resulted in less catch 
than allocated quota of 1,140 mt in 2002. And operated distribution of Korean fleet was shown in fig. 1. 
6. Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
Korean SBT fishery commenced in 1991 with a few longliners shifted from tropical waters where they 
targeted bigeye and yellowfin. Thus, in the early years of this fishery, SBT did not attract Korean fishing 
industry, but because of higher market price, from 1995 onward number of longliners rapidly increased to 
reach a maximum fleet size of 19 longliners in 1998. Annual fleet size for SBT fishery is 16 and 
registered number is still maintained in 2002. 
The Korean longline fishery operation area for southern bluefin tuna is very broad from the waters off the 
southwestern part of Australia to the waters off the southern part of Africa, extending further to the 
southeastern Atlantic Ocean in some years. However, fishing activities have generally concentrated on the 
areas between 35-45oS and 90-110oE,  35-45oS and 25-50oE, and between 40-45oS and 5-10oE. 
 
7. Other Factors 
Observer program 
Korean government initiated fisheries observer program in 2002 to monitor its distant water fisheries 
including those for tunas and to meet the requirements of regional fisheries bodies. At the initial stage, the 
size of observer program will be fairly small to cover only for the fisheries to be urgently implemented 
such as SBT longline fishery in CCSBT Convention Area but will be gradually developed to a bigger 
scale to cover all required areas of fisheries.

Resolution on Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported Fishing (IUU) and Establishment of a 
CCSBT Record of Vessels over 24 meters Authorized to Fish for Southern Bluefin Tuna 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Concerned that illegal, unregurated and unreported fishing for southern bluefin tuna is 
continuing; 
 
Noting that IUU fishing is inconsistent with objectives of the Convention and undermines the 
effectiveness of CCSBT conservation and management measures and that Members are 
required to cooperate in taking appropriate action to deter any fishing activities that are not in 
consistent with the objectives of the Convention; 
 
Noting the responsibilities of flag states to ensure that their vessels conduct their activities in a 
responsible manner; 
 
Recognising the need to take a comprehensive approach to deter IUU fishing activities and 
that a range of tools are available for this purpose 
 
Recalling that CCSBT has been taking various measures to prevent, deter and eliminate the 
IUU fisheries conducted by large-scale tuna fishing vessels including the implementing of the 
CCSBT Statistical document programme; 
 
 
 Recognizing that CCSBT adopted the Resolution to establish the status of Co-operating 
Non-member of the Extended Commission and the Extended Scientific Committee,  
 
  
Recalling that the FAO Council adopted on 23 June 2001 an International Plan of Action 
(IPOA) aiming to prevent, to deter and to eliminate IUUfishing , that this plan stipulates that 
the regional fisheries management organization should take action to strengthen and develop 
innovative ways, in conformity with international law, to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU 
fishing and in particular to establish records of vessels authorized and records of vessels 
engaged in IUU fishing,  
  
 
Noting that large-scale fishing vessels are highly mobile and easily change fishing grounds 
from one ocean to another, and have high potential of fishing for southern bluefin tuna (SBT) 
without timely registration with the Commission,  
 
Recognizing the need to take further measures to effectively eliminate the IUU large scale tuna 
fishing vessels; Agrees , in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8 of the CCSBT 
Convention, that:  
  
1. The Contracting Parties, Member of the Extended Commission and Cooperating 
Non-Members shall: 
a. ensure that all vessels under their registry do not carry out IUU fishing activities for 
southern bluefin tuna. 
b. take every possible action, consistent with relevant law, to prevent ,deter and eliminate 
IUU fishing. 
c.  review progress on the issue of IUU fishing for SBT and the implementation of it’s IUU 
measures including adopting further measures as required on a regular basis.  
 
2. The Extended Commission shall establish and maintain an CCSBT Record of fishing vessels 
larger than 24 meters in length overall (hereinafter referred to as "large scale fishing vessels" or 
"LSFVs") authorized to fish for SBT.  For the purpose of this recommendation, LSFVs not 
entered into the Record are deemed not to be authorized to fish for, retain on board, tranship or 
land SBT. 
 
3. Each Member of the Extended Commission (hereinafter referred to as “Member”), and 
Co-operating Non-member shall submit electronically, where possible, to the Executive 
Secretary by 1 July 2004, the list of LSFVs flying its flag that are authorized to fish for SBT.  
This list shall include the following information:  
      - Name of vessel(s), register number(s);  
      - Previous name(s) (if any);  
      - Previous flag(s) (if any);  
      - Previous details of deletion from other registries (if any);  
      - International radio call sign(s) (if any);  
      - Type of vessel(s), length and gross registered tonnage (GRT);  
      - Name and address of owner(s) and operator(s);  
      - Gear(s) used;  
  
      - Time period authorized for fishing and /or transhipping  
The Members and Co-operating Non-members shall indicate, when initially submitting their 
list of vessels according to this paragraph, which vessels are newly added or meant to replace 
vessels currently on their list submitted to the Executive Secretary.  The initial CCSBT record 
shall consist of all the lists submitted under this paragraph. 
 
4. Each Member and Co-operating Non-member shall promptly notify, after the establishment 
of the initial CCSBT Record, the Executive Secretary of any addition to, any deletion from 
and/or any modification of the CCSBT Record at any time such changes occur. 
 
5. The Executive Secretary shall maintain the CCSBT Record, and take any measure to ensure 
publicity of the Record and through electronic means, including placing it on the CCSBT 
website, in a manner consistent with confidentiality requirements noted by the Members and 
Co-operating Non-members. 
 
6.The flag Members and Co-operating Non-members of the vessels on the record shall: 
a) authorize their LSFVs to fish for SBT only if they are able to fulfill in respect of these 
vessels the requirements and responsibilities under the CCSBT Convention and its 
conservation and management measures; 
b) take necessary measures to ensure that their LSFVs comply with all the relevant CCSBT 
conservation and management measures; 
c) take necessary measures to ensure that their LSFVs on the CCSBT Record keep on board 
valid certificates of vessel registration and valid authorization to fish and/or tranship; 
d) affirm that if those vessels have record of IUU fishing activities, the owners have 
provided sufficient evidence demonstrating that they will not conduct such activities any 
more;  
e) ensure, to the extent possible under domestic law, that the owners and operators of their 
LSFVs on the CCSBT Record are not engaged in or associated with fishing activities for 
SBT conducted by LSFVs not entered into the CCSBT Record; 
f) take necessary measures to ensure, to the extent possible under domestic law, that the 
owners of the LSFVs on the CCSBT Record are citizens or legal entities within the flag 
Members and Co-operating Non-members so that any control or punitive actions can be 
effectively taken against them. 
 
7. The Members and Co-operating Non-members shall review their own internal actions and 
measures taken pursuant to paragraph 5, including punitive and sanction actions and in a 
  
manner consistent with domestic law as regards disclosure, report the results of the review to 
the Extended Commission at its 2004 meeting and annually thereafter. In consideration of the 
results of such review, the Extended Commission shall, if appropriate, request the flag 
Members and Co-operating Non-members of LSFVS on the CCSBT Record to take further 
action to enhance compliance by those vessels to CCSBT conservation and management 
measures. 
 
8. a) The Members and Co-operating Non-members shall take measures, under their applicable 
legislation, to prohibit the fishing for, the retaining on board, the transhipment and 
landing of SBT by the LSFVs which are not entered into the CCSBT Record. 
b) To ensure the effectiveness of the CCSBT conservation and management measures 
pertaining to SBT Statistical Document Programs: 
i) flag Members and Co-operating Non-members shall validate statistical documents 
only for the LSFVs on the CCSBT Record, 
ii) the Members and Co-operating Non-members shall require that SBT caught by 
LSFVs, when imported into the territory of a Member be accompanied by statistical 
documents validated for the vessels on the CCSBT Record and, 
iii) the Members and Co-operating Non-members importing SBT and the flag States of 
vessels shall co-operate to ensure that statistical documents are not forged or do not 
contain misinformation. 
 
9. Each Member and Co-operating Non-member shall notify the Executive Secretary of any 
factual information showing that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting LSFVs not on the 
CCSBT record to be engaged in fishing for and/or transhipment of SBT.   
 
10 a) If a vessel mentioned in paragraph 8 is flying the flag of a Member and Co-operating 
Non-member, the Executive Secretary shall request that Member and Co-operating 
Non-member to take measures necessary to prevent the vessel from fishing for SBT.  
b) If the flag of a vessel mentioned in paragraph 8 cannot be determined or is of a 
non-Member without cooperating status, the Executive Secretary shall compile such 
information for future consideration by the Extended Commission.  
 
11 The Extended Commission and the Members and Co-operating Non-members concerned 
shall communicate with each other, and make the best effort with FAO and other relevant 
regional fishery management bodies to develop and implement appropriate measures, where 
feasible, including the establishment of records of a similar nature in a timely manner so as to 
  
avoid adverse effects upon other tuna resources in other oceans.  Such adverse effects might 
consist of excessive fishing pressure resulting from a shift of the IUU LSFVs from fishing for 
SBT to other fisheries.  
  
12 Before the Extended Commission decides to implement measures specified in paragraph 8, 
the Extended Commission and the Members shall contact all the relevant countries to inform 
of this resolution and consult with them, and give them sufficient time to adopt themselves to 
this resolution.  They shall continue to encourage non-Contracting Parties to become 
Members or Co-operating non-Members.

Report of the working group on Trade Information Scheme matters 
 
A working group was formed to discuss issues in relation to the CCSBT Trade 
Information Scheme.  The issues discussed were: 
1. Minimum standards for the TIS 
2. Inclusion of a requirement to report export destination on the official TIS form 
(Annex 1 of the CCSBT Statistical Document Program) 
3. Potential improvements to the CCSBT TIS Programme. 
 
Minimum standards for the TIS 
 
The group considered the draft minimum standards that had been developed by the 
Secretariat.  The draft standards were modified and an agreed version of the minimum 
standards is presented at Annex 1. 
 
Inclusion of a requirement to report export destination on the official TIS form    
(Annex 1 of the CCSBT Statistical Document Program) 
 
The CCSBT Statistical Document Program requires exporting countries/fishing entities to 
keep a record of the destination country for each SBT shipment and report this (amongst 
other things) to the Secretariat.  At present, it is up to each member to decide how it will 
collect this information.  In order to simplify the recording of this information, New 
Zealand proposed that the destination country should be recorded on the official TIS form. 
 
The working group agreed that export destination should be included as a requirement of 
Annex 1 of the CCSBT Statistical Document Program, and be included on the official 
CCSBT TIS form. 
 
Improvements to the CCSBT TIS Programme. 
 
The working group noted that one of the objectives of the TIS Programme was to provide 
accurate, consistent and comprehensive information on the catch of SBT through trade. 
 
The group discussed emerging markets for SBT taken by both members and non-
members. It was noted that in addition to Japan, there are SBT markets developing in a 
number of other countries including the USA, Hong Kong, Korea and the Philippines.  
Taiwan also advised that it has commenced a marketing program to promote domestic 
SBT consumption.  The Indonesian Catch Monitoring Workshop had indicated that a 
small amount of Indonesia’s catch went to some EU countries.  
 
The group agreed that given the current depressed market in Japan these emerging 
markets were likely to expand.  In this context a pro-active approach to monitoring all 
SBT catches, particularly those by non-members was essential.    
The group recommended that CCSBT collaborate with relevant RFMO’s with a view to 
ensuring that their respective trade and/or catch information schemes were 
complementary and were contributing to the objectives of CCSBT. 
 
The inclusion of export destination on the TIS form would assist in identifying emerging 
SBT markets or changing SBT trade patterns as early as possible.  
 
The group also noted the deficiency of the current TIS process in monitoring domestic 
consumption and trade of SBT particularly amongst non members, and recommended 
that CCSBT investigate strategies to best characterise such catch and trade of SBT.  
Annex 1 
 
 
Minimum Standards for completion of CCSBT Statistical Documents 
(to become Annex 5 of the CCSBT Statistical Document Program) 
 
 
1. 
Responsibility of Exporter and Exporting Country/Fishing Entity 
1.1. 
The exporter is responsible for completing the export section of the statistical 
document (except for item 8 - validation) and the source of the product (captured 
or farmed). 
1.2. 
The exporting country/fishing entity is responsible for enforcing correct 
completion of each statistical document.  The export section (items 1-8), the 
document number and the source of the product (captured or farmed) must be 
correctly completed in accordance with the instruction sheet of Annex 1. 
1.3. 
The exporting country/fishing entity must ensure that the validator is responsible 
for checking that the statistical document is fully completed and is correct.  The 
validation section of the statistical document should only be completed and the 
export approved when this check has been conducted and the statistical document 
has been determined to be complete and correct. 
 
 
2. 
Responsibility of Importer and Importing Country/Fishing Entity 
2.1. 
The importer is responsible for completing the import section of the statistical 
document. 
2.2. 
The importing country/fishing entity is responsible for enforcing correct 
completion of the import section of each statistical document.  The import section 
must be correctly completed in accordance with the instruction sheet of Annex 1. 
2.3 
If any information specified in 1.2 is missing, illegible or incorrect, the importing 
member country/fishing entity should report such deficiencies to the Secretariat.  
The reports will be provided to the Secretariat on a quarterly basis.  The report 
will include the document number in question and identify the missing, illegible 
and/or incorrect information. 
 
3. 
Responsibility of the Executive Secretary 
3.1. 
The Executive Secretary will monitor the accuracy and completeness of all 
statistical documents received. 
3.2. 
When information on SDP documents is found to be missing or inaccurate, the 
Executive Secretary will contact the countries/fishing entities involved1 to advise 
them of what they are required to provide and to request that the 
missing/inaccurate information be provided or corrected2. If the requested 
information is not supplied within an appropriate time frame, or if information is 
repeatedly omitted by a country/fishing entity, the Executive Secretary will refer 
the matter to the Extended Commission for consideration. 
 
                                                 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 This will be the export country/fishing entity for all items of information except the import section, which 
will be the import country. 
2 It is expected that the exporting country/fishing entity would take appropriate action against the exporting 
company/validators if information is repeatedly omitted.

Revised Confidentiality Policy of 
the CCSBT Central Database and the CCSBT Statistical Document Program 
 
 
 (1)  Confidentiality Policy for the CCSBT Central Database 
 
This is the policy for releasing data from the CCSBT Central Database.  This policy 
has no influence on the data that should be provided to the database by members of 
the Extended Commission and other parties. 
 
The use of the word “data” in this policy refers to both raw and aggregated data. 
 
The CCSBT will publish and provide on request national catch and effort (number of 
hooks for longline fisheries and search hours for surface fisheries) and length 
frequency data by 5° square by month for longline and 1° square by month for each 
other gear type.  
 
All other data provided for the CCSBT database will be treated confidentially and will 
not be released by the Secretariat except where members of the Extended Commission 
approve the specific data release on a case by case basis. 
 
Consensus at SAG/ESC meetings and subsequent approval by the Extended 
Commission is sufficient approval for release of specific data to members of the 
Extended Commission for the purpose of routine data exchange for the stock 
assessment and management procedure.  This approval will apply until the Extended 
Commission revises the data confidentiality policy. Release of other data requires case 
by case approval from an exchange of correspondence (including e-mails) between 
Extended Commission member’s nominated contacts. 
 
When providing approval to release specific data, members of the Extended 
Commission can specify that the particular data does not require their re-approval for 
future releases by the Secretariat.  In these situations, members of the Extended 
Commission must also specify the groups of people (e.g. public, Extended 
Commission members) to whom the Secretariat may release the data without 
requiring case by case re-approval.  The Secretariat will maintain a list of data sets 
(and associated groups of people) that are approved for release without requiring case 
by case re-approval.  The list will be provided to members of the Extended 
Commission and members of the Extended Commission have the right to revise the 
approvals that they have given. 
 
(2) Amendment to Section 5.3 of the CCSBT Statistical Document Program 
5.3 
The Executive Secretary shall report to the Commission on and circulate to all 
Members the data collected by the Program each year by 1 June for the period 
of 1 July - 31 December of the preceding year and by 1 December for the period 
of 1 January - 30 June of the current year. The formats of the reports are 
attached as Annex 2 and Annex 2a. The Executive Secretariat shall provide an 
electronic copy of the report only to a designated authority of each Member. The 
Secretariat will post on the CCSBT website a subset of the report comprising: 
• Import country 
• Flag country 
• Harvest year 
• Gear code 
• Net weight
