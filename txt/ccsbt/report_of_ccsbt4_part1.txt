Report of the Fourth Annual Meeting 
First Part 
8 – 13 September 1997 
Canberra, Australia 
 
 
The representatives of the Governments of Australia, Japan and New Zealand convened 
the Fourth Annual Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna (CCSBT4) from 8 to 13 September 1997. 
 
Agenda Item 1: Opening of Meeting 
 
1.1  Election of Chair and Vice Chair for CCSBT4 
 
The Secretariat noted that the Chair and Vice Chair of the Commission had been elected 
immediately prior to the conclusion of the resumed third annual meeting. However, 
New Zealand had since advised that the Chair had fallen vacant. In accordance with 
Rule 4 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure, New Zealand had selected Mr Royce 
Elliott as Chair. New Zealand's nomination was approved by the Commission. The Vice 
Chair for the meeting was Mr Yasuo Takase (Japan), as elected at the resumed third 
annual meeting. 
 
1.2  Welcoming Address 
 
The Chair welcomed delegates from Australia, Japan and New Zealand, and observers 
from the Republic of Korea and Taiwan. Mr Hermes from Australia was identified as 
the observer from the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living 
Resources (CCAMLR). Mr Morishita from Japan was identified as the observer from 
the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). 
 
1.3  Adoption of the Agenda 
 
The agreed agenda and list of participants are at Attachments A and B, respectively. 
 
1.4  Appointment of Rapporteurs 
 
Rapporteurs were appointed as follows: for Australia, Mr Barrington and Ms Wallace, 
for Japan, Mr Komatsu and Mr Morishita, and for New Zealand, Ms Futschek and Ms 
Robinson. 
 
A list of documents tabled at the meeting is shown as Attachment C. 
 
Agenda Item 2: Opening Statements 
 
2.1  Australia 
 
Australia's opening statement is included in full at Attachment D. 
 
 
 
2
2.2 Japan 
 
Japan presented an oral summary of its opening statement, which is included in full at 
Attachment E. 
 
2.3  New Zealand 
 
New Zealand presented an oral summary of its opening statement, which is included in 
full at Attachment F. 
 
2.4  Other States and Entities 
 
2.4.1 The Republic of Korea 
 
The Republic of Korea's oral summary of its opening statement is included at 
Attachment G. 
 
2.4.2  Taiwan 
 
The representative from Taiwan thanked the CCSBT for the invitation to attend 
CCSBT4 as an observer. He hoped that this meeting would have excellent outcomes; he 
thought it very important for the Republic of Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan to join next 
year's Commission meeting as members. 
 
2.4.3 Indonesia 
 
The Members expressed disappointment that Indonesia had been unable to send an 
observer to the meeting. 
 
Agenda Item 3: Application by Greenpeace International for Independent  
 
 
 
 
Observer Status at CCSBT Meetings 
 
The Executive Secretary advised that the Commission had received a request for an 
invitation for Greenpeace International to attend the fourth annual Commission meeting 
as an observer. However, Japan had not supported the application. In accordance with 
Rule 3.5 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure, the Commission considered the 
objection at this meeting. 
 
Japan stated that it did not support the application because Greenpeace was known to 
use radical methods to achieve its goals and to act against the provisions and spirit of 
the Convention. Japan stated that in light of the Commission's objective to ensure, 
through appropriate management, the conservation and optimum utilisation of southern 
bluefin tuna, it would be inappropriate to assign observer status to Greenpeace. 
 
New Zealand noted the clear movement to ensure transparency in international fora 
through the participation of observers. New Zealand was firmly of the view that the 
Commission's proceedings should also be transparent. It stated there were good reasons 
to facilitate observation of the meeting by non-government organisations (NGOs) with a 
legitimate interest in the management of SBT. Active exclusion of outside parties 
 
3
inevitably led to mistrust. From its experience in domestic fora, New Zealand believed 
that the participation of groups with an interest in the fishery led to a clearer 
understandings of the issues by all parties. New Zealand stated that it would continue to 
support the involvement of Greenpeace as an observer at the Commission meetings. 
 
Australia associated itself with the comments by New Zealand and affirmed its support 
for transparency in the Commission's dealings through the involvement of both industry 
and environmental NGOs. 
 
The Chair noted that observers can only participate in Commission meetings if the 
Commission offered an explicit invitation to attend. In the absence of consensus within 
the Commission about extending such an invitation to Greenpeace, the chair concluded 
that Greenpeace could not be invited to the meeting. The Commission noted Australia's 
concerns that such a rejection should not be seen as establishing a precedent for future 
applications for observer status by NGOs. 
 
Agenda Item 4: Report from the Secretariat 
 
The Executive Secretary introduced the Report of the Secretariat (Attachment H) 
which summarised the Secretariat's activities since the last Commission meeting. The 
Commission noted the Report, thanked the Secretariat for its work, expressed its 
appreciation for the presentation and usefulness of the report. 
 
Agenda Item 5: Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
Mr Iino (Japan) was elected as Chair of the Standing Committee for Finance and 
Administration. The Committee adopted an agenda for the Committee meeting 
(Attachment I) and considered the following papers: 
 
• 
Report from the Secretary (CCSBT/9709/5); 
• 
Proposed Procedure to Finalise and Adopt the Japanese Version of Reports 
 
(CCSBT/9709/6); 
• 
Revised Budget for 1997 (CCSBT/9709/7); 
• 
Draft Budget for 1998 (CCSBT/9709/8). 
 
The Committee Chair presented a report to the Commission which was adopted. The 
report of the Committee is at Attachment I. It included a revised budget for 1997 
(Attachment J). 
 
The Executive Secretary spoke to the Secretariat's paper CCSBT/9709/8. The 
Committee gave qualified endorsement of the draft budget for 1998, noting that a 
revised budget may need to be prepared depending on the outcome of decisions by the 
Commission on data management, costs of meetings outside Canberra, and 1998 work 
plan. The Finance and Administration Committee requested the Secretariat to prepare a 
revised 1998 budget for consideration intersessionally or at any resumed Commission 
meeting in 1997 once decisions had been made on these three items. 
 
 
 
 
4
Agenda Item 6: Compliance Issues 
 
6.1  Terms of Reference for the Compliance Committee 
 
The Commission adopted the draft terms of reference (TOR) for the Compliance 
Committee (Attachment K). The Commission agreed that the Committee would hold 
its first meeting in conjunction with CCSBT5. 
 
6.2  Implementation of Article 8(9) of the Convention, Monitoring 
 
The Commission agreed to defer this matter to the first meeting of the Compliance 
Committee which will be held in conjunction with CCSBT5. 
 
Agenda Item 7: Review of SBT Fisheries 
 
The Commission considered the Review of SBT Fisheries reports prepared by Australia 
(CCSBT/9709/11) (Attachment L), Japan (CCSBT/9709/12) (Attachment M), New 
Zealand (CCSBT/9709/13) (Attachment N) and Taiwan (CCSBT/9709/27) 
(Attachment O) and an oral presentation by the Republic of Korea. 
 
The Commission asked that observers from Taiwan and the Republic of Korea present 
information about their respective fisheries in the same written format used by 
Commission Parties. 
 
The Commission adopted a proforma for the preparation of the Review of SBT 
Fisheries. The Commission asked the Secretariat to seek information from 
non-members using the pro-forma for subsequent meetings. 
 
Australia requested that Japan advise of details of actual catch in its report, as well as 
planned catch. Australia reiterated its request for clarification of how Japan arrived at a 
figure of 55 per cent survival rate for non-retained SBT and the level of non-retained 
catch in 1995 that Japan stated it would supply at CCSBT3. Australia queried what was 
Japan's policy in relation to non-retention for 1997 and what was the magnitude (in 
tonnes) of the non-retained catch in 1996. Australia also sought feedback from Japan on 
the arrangements that had been developed to strengthen compliance, following the 
issues that arose in 1996. 
 
Japan advised that the provisional catches by area for the calendar year 1996 were as 
outlined below: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Area

other (research vessel catch, by catch after 
minor 
season and fishing in other areas) 
 
 
 
Total 
6,012

Japan reported that, as of 1997, Japan no longer had a policy of releasing small SBT.  
Japan agreed to respond in detail to the remaining Australian queries out of session. 
 
New Zealand noted that the three members have their own observer programs. It 
considered there would be benefits for the Commission, if the members harmonised 
their respective observer programs in regard to SBT. This would include collaboration 
about issues such as determining the nature and extent of information to be collected 
and appropriate levels of observer coverage for stock assessment purposes.   
 
Japan noted that it has a statistically appropriate level of observer coverage and it 
believed its current level of observer coverage was sufficient. It reported that data 
collected under the Real Time Monitoring Program (RTMP) had been extended to all 
Japanese vessels taking SBT. Japan stated that rather than examining the level of 
observer coverage, the value of the current observer data should be appreciated in the 
light of overall information provided and its value to the Scientific Committee. 
 
Japan reported that import statistics from the Ministry of Finance, indicated that when 
the conversion factor of 1.15 was applied to the 1996 SBT import statistics from Taiwan, 
Taiwan had exceeded its voluntary catch limit of 1,450 t. Taiwan reported that a vessel 
had caught 110 t of SBT in December 1995 which was not landed until January 1996, 
resulting in the apparent overcatch of the 1,450 t catch limit for 1996. 
 
Taiwan reported that most fishing for SBT occurred on the high seas in the Indian 
Ocean and Atlantic Ocean off southern Africa, and these vessels are required to report 
catches of SBT. The representative has been unable to confirm as yet through interviews 
with fishing vessel masters whether the Atlantic Ocean catch was SBT or northern 
bluefin tuna (NBT). While most catch of SBT was as a by-catch, 16 of the 145 fishing 
vessels had caught more than 10 t of SBT during 1996. The Taiwanese authorities 
monitored the catch and once 1,450 t had been caught, fishers were required to return 
SBT to the ocean. 
 
New Zealand expressed concern at the use of such a practice as a mechanism to limit 
total catch. 
 
Japan refuted the assertion that the Taiwanese fleet fished in areas where SBT would 
only be taken as a bycatch. The fishing areas identified in the Taiwanese report were 
largely south of other tuna fishing grounds and were, in fact, at latitudes where SBT was 
a target species. 
 
The Republic of Korea reported that Korean fishing for SBT had begun in the early 
1990s with annual catches varying by year, season, and vessel numbers. Korean 
longliners targeting yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna, had moved progressively into the 
SBT grounds. In recent years fishing for SBT occurred during most of the year. From 
1992 the catch of SBT had increased such that in 1996, eight Korean longliners caught 
1,179 t of SBT (around 147 t of SBT per vessel). To June 1997, thirteen Korean 
longliners had caught 886 t of SBT in an area of operation which now extended from 
south west Australia to the south east Atlantic. Of the Korean SBT catch 70 to 80 per 
cent was exported to Japan, with the remainder consumed domestically. The level of 
 
6
domestic consumption of SBT was increasing. Within the ICCAT area Statistical 
Document Forms were completed for all northern bluefin tuna (NBT) catch. 
 
Each member sought clarification on some of the points raised in other members' 
reports or presentations. Members agreed to respond to each other's queries in a timely 
manner. A response from Australia to questions from Japan was tabled at the meeting 
(Attachment P). 
 
Agenda Item 8: Relationship with Other Parties 
 
8.1; 8.2 The Republic of Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan; Other Parties 
 
The Commission agreed on the need for urgent action to facilitate the accession of the 
Republic of Korea and Indonesia to the CCSBT and to secure Taiwan's cooperation. The 
catch of these non-members had risen rapidly over the past few years to the point where 
it threatened the recovery of the SBT stock. Such action is contrary to their international 
obligations to cooperate in conservation and management of the SBT stock. 
 
The Commission also noted the increasing number of other non-members fishing for 
SBT. All members expressed their concern at this trend and recognised the need to 
collect more information and to facilitate accession to the CCSBT or cooperation of 
non-members. 
 
The Commission had substantial discussions in relation to concerns over non-member 
catch of SBT, the need for non-members to accede to the Convention or apply its 
conservation and management measures, and the need for non-members to immediately 
reduce the level of fishing for SBT. Resolution on this matter was deferred to the 
Resumed Fourth Annual Meeting. 
 
8.3 Reports from Meetings of Relevant Fisheries Management Organisations 
 
Australia reported that the IOTC at its last meeting had recognised the CCSBT as 
having primary responsibility for the management of SBT. Australia undertook to 
circulate the text of the relevant meeting to New Zealand and Japan. 
 
8.4 Relevant Organisations and International Instruments 
 
The Executive Secretary introduced the paper Relationship with Other Parties - 
Relevant Organisations and International Instruments (CCSBT/9709/16) which set out 
proposals for establishing relationships between the CCSBT and other international 
organisations and compliance with international instruments. 
 
Australia and New Zealand asked that the Secretariat prepare a detailed analysis of  
provisions in the UNIA, as the Agreement is of direct relevance to the Commission.  
Japan requested the Secretariat to prepare a paper on the timing and appropriateness of 
establishing collaborative management arrangements with relevant international 
organisations and arrangements that purported competence over SBT. 
 
The Commission noted and thanked the Secretariat for preparing the paper and agreed 
 
7
to provide written comments out of session. The Secretariat was asked to complete the 
tasks identified by the members and report intersessionally. 
 
8.5 FAO - Co-ordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics 
 
After considering a report from the Secretariat (CCSBT/9709/17), the Commission 
recognised the general merits for CCSBT to cooperate with the FAO Coordinating 
Working Party (CWP) on Fishery Statistics. Recognising the importance of cooperating 
with the CWP, Japan supported the recommendation by the Secretariat that the CCSBT 
join the CWP. While the Commission agreed that the Secretariat should initiate steps 
necessary to apply for membership of the CWP, Australia and New Zealand asked the 
Secretariat to provide additional information to members about the responsibilities and 
obligations of a member, noting that the level of involvement should be determined by 
the Commission in light of budgetary and other priorities. 
 
8.6 IGOs Attendance at Scientific Committee Meetings 
 
Japan stated that it had submitted an interpretation of Article 14 of the Convention in 
relation to IGO attendance at Scientific Committee meetings to the Commission 
Secretariat out of session. Japan considered that while a strict interpretation of the 
Convention precluded IGOs from being invited to participate at Scientific Committee 
meetings, other options for inviting participation should be developed out of session. 
 
New Zealand noted Japan's position, but considered that in the absence of agreed Rules 
of Procedure for the Scientific Committee, the Commission's Rules of Procedure would 
apply. Rule 3(1) of these provide with the consensus of the parties for the attendance of 
IGOs. Australia considered that the Commission should be able to invite relevant IGOs 
to attend Scientific Committee meetings as such participation provided tangible benefits. 
The Commission recognised and agreed that there were benefits in inviting relevant 
IGOs to meetings of the Scientific Committee and agreed to consider inviting them to 
the 1998 Scientific Committee Meeting, using a mechanism acceptable to all the 
members. 
 
Agenda Item 9: Trade Issues for Southern Bluefin Tuna 
 
9.1 Certification of Trade in Southern Bluefin Tuna 
 
Australia strongly supported the immediate introduction of a statistical document 
program to provide accurate information on the origin and volume of SBT entering 
international trade. Australia indicated that there were good international precedents, 
and advocated a scheme along the lines already implemented by ICCAT. 
 
Australia proposed that a certification scheme be devised by 30 November 1997 and 
implemented by 1 March 1999 as a necessary part of a coordinated approach to 
documenting and controlling rapidly expanding non-member catch. 
 
The Commission noted that more detailed SBT trade information was a key issue to be 
addressed. 
 
 
8
Australia and New Zealand stressed that the development of a trade certification scheme 
would be a decisive action in the face of the dramatic increases of non-member SBT 
catch. The members made a strong commitment to intersessional work, with the 
objective of evaluating such a scheme as soon as practicable. 
 
Agenda Item 10: Scientific Committee Meeting 
 
10.1  Report from the Scientific Committee 
 
Dr. Annala, Chair of the Third Meeting of the Scientific Committee (Canberra, 28 July 
to 8 August 1997) provided a summary of the outcomes contained in the Report of the 
Meeting (CCSBT/9709/Rep 2) (Attachment Q) and some personal comments on the 
Scientific Committee process (Attachment R). 
 
The Commission thanked Dr. Annala for his contribution to the work of the Scientific 
Committee and acknowledged the work of the external scientists. The heads of the 
scientific delegations provided statements about this year's Scientific Committee 
meeting (Attachment S). The members agreed to respond intersessionally to queries 
raised in this session. 
 
Commission scientists present at the Annual Meeting met informally during the meeting 
to develop a work plan for the Scientific Committee for 1997/98 (Attachment T). 
Australia and New Zealand sought the approval of the Commission to adopt the report.  
Japan did not support the proposed approach, because it considered there had not been 
sufficient time to discuss it. The Commission noted the report and deferred further 
consideration until the Resumed Fourth Annual Meeting. 
 
10.2 Report from the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
 
The Chair invited Australia as chair of the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
(ERSWG) to provide a summary of the Second Meeting of the Working Group 
(CCSBT/9709/Rep 2). The Commission agreed to adopt the recommendations in 
Attachment U. 
 
New Zealand noted that the 1997 Scientific Committee recognised the necessity for 
improving the effectiveness of the ERSWG by strengthening its capacity for technical 
evaluations of information. New Zealand asked that the parties give serious 
consideration to this issue and endeavour to complete work on the draft technical papers, 
with the objective of allowing consideration of final versions of those papers at 
CCSBT5. 
 
10.3 Rules of Procedure for the Scientific Committee 
 
The Commission noted the Draft Rules of Procedure for the Scientific Committee 
(CCSBT/9709/19). The Members agreed to exchange comments intersessionally on the 
revised draft. 
 
The Commission also agreed that the Scientific Committee should continue 
implementing the procedures and approaches developed at the Scientific Process 
 
9
Workshop at Coogee in May 1997, noting that these had already contributed to 
improved effectiveness at the 1997 Scientific Committee meeting. 
 
Agenda Item 11: Review of Scientific Process Workshop 
 
11.1 Late Data 
 
The Commission agreed that the provision of late data was a serious issue and 
acknowledged that data required for feeding into the scientific process were consistently 
late. The scientists had suggested lack of time as being one reason for not reaching 
conclusions in the Scientific Committee. The Commission urged the members to ensure 
the Scientists had the data in time to complete the assessments with which the 
Commission had tasked them. New Zealand considered that one response to late data 
was to defer the time table accordingly. This would ensure that the Scientists had 
adequate time to complete their analysis following receipt of the data. It was agreed that 
the Secretariat would forward communications to those providing their data late. 
 
11.2 Two Year Stock Assessment Cycle 
 
The Commission agreed that a stock assessment should be conducted every year for the 
time being. Japan noted that there are some instances where a two-year stock 
assessment is adopted in other international organisations, but in each case the condition 
of the stock was stable. Australia and New Zealand agreed that a two-year stock 
assessment cycle might be a possibility within the context of a well defined 
management strategy for the future, noting that such a two-year cycle was inconsistent 
with Article 9(3) of the Convention. 
 
11.3 Fine Scale Data 
 
Australia acknowledged the cooperative access already provided for Australian 
scientists to fine scale data in Japan. Australia explained the desirability of the members 
making the fine scale data more easily accessible to the members' scientists, as the 
current arrangements constrain the analyses that can be completed. Australia suggested 
that a possible compromise solution would be the exchange of data at the level of 1 
degree squares. However, Japan felt there was insufficient basis to support this point 
and that provision of 1 degree square data could infringe on the confidentiality of 
commercial/private data. Japan also believed cooperation from industry might be 
difficult to obtain. New Zealand supported Australia's views, and noted there was a need 
to develop mechanisms to expeditiously and practically exchange fine scale data 
between members. 
 
New Zealand strongly supported continued and improved provision of fine scale data, 
and this would go some way to improving scientific results. New Zealand added that if 
there were a good intent there were ways to overcome commercial confidentiality 
issues. 
 
 
 
11.4 Other Matters Arising 
 
10
 
There were no matters arising. 
 
Agenda Item 12: Role of Secretariat in Data Management 
(including Implementation of Article 8(1) of the Convention, Data Collection) 
 
The Commission accepted that there was a role for the Secretariat to maintain data for 
the purposes of information exchange with other organisations and providing 
information to the public. 
 
It was agreed that the nature, scale and format for the data and arrangements for its 
maintenance would be developed in close consultation with scientists from member 
countries. A draft data base format to be maintained by the Secretariat was prepared by 
the Secretariat in collaboration with Japan (Attachment V). Australia and New Zealand 
expressed concerns about the scope, scale and cost of the proposed data base, and 
potential duplication with the Scientific Committee. The Commission agreed that the 
members would provide comments on the draft intersessionally. 
 
Agenda Item 13: Proposal for an Experimental Fishing Program 
 
New Zealand noted that Steps 1 & 2 of the process to evaluate experimental fishing 
were to identify and narrow the range of uncertainty in the stock assessment as much as 
possible; assign objective weightings to those uncertainties; and determine the risk 
which catch in addition to 11,750 t would pose to the recovery of the stock. This work 
has not been completed. Although it is important to take steps to resolve uncertainty, the 
Commission could not evaluate the risks and benefits of resolving uncertainties in 
CPUE associated with implementing experimental fishing, particularly in comparison 
with resolution of other sources of uncertainty. New Zealand considered that there are 
serious risks associated with increased catch levels and it would be irresponsible to 
implement an Experimental Fishing Program (EFP) at this time. 
 
Japan expressed its regrets that the Third Scientific Committee meeting could not fulfill 
its mission of completing Steps 1 & 2. It also noted the lack of progress on the issue of 
an Experimental Fishing Program (EFP) (CCSBT/9709/22) since the proposal was first 
made in 1995. Japan emphasized the need to implement the EFP as soon as possible, 
because the EFP would, in its view, definitely contribute to the resolution of one of the 
major uncertainties, i.e. CPUE hypothesis, and presents, logically, no risk to the 
recovery of the SBT stock under the proposed pay-back system. Japan also presented a 
new analysis that if the EFP can rule out the Variable Square hypothesis, the model 
projections for recovery of the stock to 1980 levels would be improved as follows; 
 
 
Including Variable Square hypothesis 
% 
Excluding Variable Square hypothesis 
% 
Aust.

Japan

Australia pointed out that it was inappropriate for Japan to be presenting projections 
which other delegations and the Scientific Committee had not had the opportunity to 
 
11
consider. Australia considered that, given the current stock status and prospects for 
recovery, the risks associated with experimental fishing were too great and therefore 
Australia did not support Japan's proposal to implement a pilot experimental fishing 
program. 
 
Agenda Item 14: Total Allowable Catch and Quota Allocation 
 
Japan renewed its proposal to increase the TAC by 3,000 t or more, referring to the high 
stock recovery probabilities of more than 60 per cent by the Japanese VPA analysis, 
using both Japanese and Australian weightings. Japan also stressed that managers 
should not use uncertainties or a lack of perfect information as an excuse for not making 
decisions, based on the currently available information, because the available 
information provides a basis for making a decision. 
 
New Zealand noted the depleted status of the stock and, as estimated by New Zealand 
and Australia, the low probability of stock recovery to the 1980 level of parental 
biomass by the year 2020. Several other factors concerned New Zealand including the 
high exploitation rate on recruiting year classes, the sharp increase in non-member catch 
and the optimistic bias of projections undertaken to date. Given the status of the stock 
and the uncertainty in the stock assessment, New Zealand urged the Commission to give 
serious consideration to the application of conservation measures to better ensure the 
recovery of the stock. New Zealand considered that this could only be achieved through 
a reduction to the current TAC of 11,750 t and the adoption of urgent steps to restrain 
non-member catch. New Zealand considers such action would be in line with the 
precautionary approach specified in Articles 5 and 6 of UNIA. These articles specify 
that "States shall be more cautious when information is uncertain, unreliable or 
inadequate. The absence of adequate scientific information shall not be used as a reason 
for postponing or failing to take conservation and management measures." 
 
Australia considered that the SBT stock remained in a severely depleted condition and 
noted the 1996 Scientific Committee Report stated that the parental biomass was only 8 
per cent or lower, when compared with the 1960 parental biomass. The recent rapid 
increase in non-member catches of SBT, meant that Australian assessment of the 
probability of the recovery of the stock to 1980 levels by 2020 had further declined. 
Australia therefore strongly favoured a precautionary approach in setting the global 
TAC. 
 
This item generated considerable debate but has yet to be concluded. 
 
Australia expressed its concern that it would soon set its national SBT quota allocation 
for 1997-98. In the absence of a global TAC for SBT, Australia confirmed that it would 
restrain its SBT catch to a level no higher than that agreed for Australia in 1996-97 by 
the Commission. New Zealand stated that, it would restrain its catch in 1997/98 to the 
1996-97 national catch allocations under the global TAC. New Zealand was strongly of 
the view that this was the only responsible action to take, in the absence of a global 
TAC for 1997-98. 
 
Japan was of the view that the decisions of both Australia and New Zealand on 
voluntary catch restrictions should reflect their respective views on stock status. 
 
12
 
Agenda Item 15: Future Quota Allocation Mechanism 
 
Japan commented on the paper 'A Future Quota Allocation Mechanism for Parties in 
accordance with the Provisions of the Convention (CCSBT/9709/23)'. The proposal 
sought to review the national allocations of SBT to Members in light of the entry into 
force of the Convention and to see whether the current allocation mechanism, which 
was established before the Convention came into force, was appropriate. Japan stated 
that the paper proposed amended shares for the Members' national SBT allocations, 
based on six factors, outlined in the paper. A calculation of the allocations, using the six 
factors was completed and the results are included in the paper. 
 
Australia and New Zealand did not support Japan's interpretation of criteria described in 
Article 8(4) of the Convention or the weightings used by Japan. They stated that at this 
time, Commission efforts should focus on priority issues such as non-members and 
certification of SBT trade. New Zealand noted that the proposed criteria did not take 
into account the current mechanism for future quota allocation. In reply, Japan sought a 
detailed response from New Zealand and Australia on their concerns in relation to the 
Japanese weightings and factors and a commitment to a serious discussion on this 
matter at some stage. 
 
The Commission agreed to consider this matter in the future, but that it be set aside in 
the interim to allow the Commission to focus on other significant priorities. 
 
Agenda Item 16: Conversion Factors 
 
In 1996 the Scientific Committee advised that the historically applied conversion factor 
of 1.15 was unsatisfactory over all areas. New Zealand and Australia believe that the 
Scientific Committee concluded at their 1996 meeting that the most reasonable global 
conversion relationship was: 
 
whole weight = (1.155* processed weight) + 1.39 
 
New Zealand and Australia considered that the 1996 Scientific Committee had 
identified an appropriate global conversion factor. However, the Commission decided 
that the management implications, including those relating to the TAC and allocations, 
meant the Commission deferred consideration of changing the conversion factor at this 
time. 
 
Japan stated that the report of the Scientific Committee does record differences of 
opinion on an appropriate conversion factor. Japan noted that the proposed conversion 
factor, if and when it were to be used, would necessitate an increase in the national SBT 
allocations since the current stock assessments are conducted on the basis of number of 
fish, not weight. 
 
Australia and New Zealand understood that the Scientific Committee had undertaken 
considerable work on this matter and were reluctant to return it to that forum for further 
consideration. However, they acknowledged the link identified by Japan between the 
conversion factors and the Commission's global SBT TAC and national allocations.

Agenda Item 17: Confidentiality of Commission Documents 
 
Japan thanked the Secretariat for the revised paper [Confidentiality of Commission 
Documents (CCSBT/9709/24 Rev1)] that took into account discussion on the matter in 
previous Commission meetings. It considered that the paper should be edited to ensure 
that it clearly stated that the reports of Subsidiary Committees would only become 
public after the adoption of the relevant Commission meeting report. 
 
The Secretariat agreed to amend the text accordingly, and suggested a minor 
amendment such that Subsidiary Committee reports would be available once the 
Commission meeting report had been adopted. 
 
Members undertook to provide comments on matters they had identified in relation to 
the paper to the Secretariat out of session. 
 
The Commission agreed to the Secretariat preparing a revised paper out of session. 
 
Agenda Item 18: CCSBT Management Strategy 
 
The Commission noted that at CCSBT3 it would convene the Management Strategy 
workshop, at a venue (to be decided) from 27 - 30 October 1997. Papers to be 
considered at the workshop include: SBT Management Arrangements 1997 
(CCSBT/9709/26) and the Draft Management Strategy prepared by Australia (Version 
February 1997) (CCSBT/9709/27). 
 
Agenda Item 19: Program of Work for 1997-98 
 
The Commission agreed to an Australian request that meetings of the Scientific 
Committee would be held at least five weeks prior to meetings of the Commission, in 
order to meet Australian Ministerial briefing requirements. 
 
The Commission prepared a draft Program of Work for 1997-98 (Attachment W) to be 
considered at the resumed Fourth Annual Commission Meeting. 
 
New Zealand advised that as the next meeting would be a resumed meeting, New 
Zealand would retain the Chair, and it is highly likely that the meeting would be 
convened in Canberra because it would be required to meet the additional cost of the 
meeting in New Zealand. 
 
Agenda Item 20: Other Business 
 
There was no other business. 
 
 
 
 
 
Agenda Item 21: Close of the Meeting 
 
14
 
21.1 Election of Chair and Vice Chair for 1997-98 
 
The meeting did not close, therefore the elections did not occur. 
 
21.2 Adoption of the Report of the Meeting 
 
The meeting approved and adopted the report of the meeting. 
 
21.3 Closure of the Meeting 
 
The Commission acknowledged the excellent work of the Chair during the course of the 
meeting. All delegations acknowledged the interpreters and the Secretariat for their hard 
work. 
 
New Zealand acknowledged the Secretariat especially Ms Maree Tuohy who would be 
leaving the Commission shortly. New Zealand regrets the lack of progress on many of 
the key issues at this meeting. In particular, New Zealand noted the disparate positions 
in the Commission on key issues such as accession or cooperation of non-members, the 
setting of a global TAC and consideration of observer status of non-government 
organisations in Commission meetings. At CCSBT4 the members developed a 
Communique calling for the immediate accession or cooperation of non-members and 
substantial reductions of their SBT catch. For its part, New Zealand pressed strongly for 
the Communique to be released and passed directly to non-members at CCSBT4 and to 
finalise plans for demarches to non-members to negotiate accession or cooperation.  
Given the lack of progress in this and other key areas, New Zealand looked forward to 
resolving those issues at the reconvened meeting, which should be held as soon as 
practicable. 
 
Australia recorded its great disappointment at the lack of progress on the resolution of 
the core issues of quotas, accession of non-members and certification. It regarded these 
matters as crucial to ensuring the conservation and sustainable use of the SBT fishery 
and the integrity of the Commission and committed itself to work with the other 
members to resolve these issues at the resumed meeting. 
 
The Japanese delegation joined the other members in thanking the Chairman, the 
observers from Taiwan and the Republic of Korea for their patience, and the interpreters 
for their hard work. Japan asked the observers to commit themselves to attending 
subsequent meetings of the Commission and to the early accession to the Convention or 
cooperation with the conservation and management measures of the Commission.  
Japan regretted that the meeting had not been able to finalise the TAC, review of 
national allocations, EFP to contribute for resolving uncertainty of the SBT stock 
assessment and early accession or cooperation of non-members. Japan hoped that the 
meeting would resume as early as possible and be able to finalise the outstanding work. 
 
The Commission agreed to adjourn the meeting. The Commission agreed that the 
agenda of Resumed CCSBT4 would comprise unresolved agenda items from 
CCSBR4(1). These were: 
 
 
15
Non-members; 
Trade information issues; 
Total Allowable Catch and national allocations; 
Proposal for an experimental fishing program; 
Work program; and 
1998 Budget. 
 
The Commission agreed CCSBT4 should be resumed as soon as possible.

Opening Statement: CCSBT4 
Australia 
 
 
I would like to welcome all delegations to the Fourth Annual Meeting of the 
Commission. 
Australia is convinced that urgent and decisive action is required at this meeting to 
secure recovery of SBT stocks and to achieve sustainable management of the Southern 
Bluefin Tuna fishery. 
Australia is deeply concerned that the Commission's management efforts to halt the 
decline in SBT stocks and to build a stable framework for stock recovery are in 
jeopardy. 
Some differences of view remain on aspects of the stock assessment, but on many basic 
points the scientists are in agreement. The SBT stock is depleted far below safe levels of 
parental biomass, and the expansion in unregulated catch outside the Commission 
regime is seriously prejudicing recovery of the SBT stock. 
There is increasing and justified international scrutiny of both SBT stock status and 
environmental impacts in the global SBT fishery, such as seabird bycatch. This 
Commission has a strong mandate to deal with both issues and must be prepared to 
explore new mechanisms for securing a sustainable and environmentally responsible 
future for the SBT resource and the fishing industries which depend on it. 
There are clear international standards and principles which need to be recognised and 
met by both members and observers at this Commission. The CCSBT Convention, the 
Law of the Sea and the United Nations Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly 
Migratory Fish Stocks all demand cooperation amongst all those who fish for SBT. 
New measures, such as the swift introduction of a scheme for certification of 
international trade in SBT, are vital to strengthen that cooperation and underpin 
responsible management action so as to secure sustainable and responsible use of global 
stocks of SBT. 
Australia is committed to working closely with all delegations to use this week to 
deliver substantial, tangible improvements to our collective management of the 
Southern Bluefin Tuna fishery.

Opening Statement by Japan at the Fourth Annual Meeting of CCSBT 
 
September 1997 
Canberra 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, Country Representatives, Observers, 
 
At the outset of the 4th Annual Meeting of CCSBT, I would like to say a few words. 
 
I am informed that Dr. Turner, who has guided us as the chair of the Commission 
meeting for the last few sessions, has been promoted to a new position. I would like to 
take this opportunity to praise the enormous contribution she made to CCSBT and at the 
same time express my deep appreciation. I would like to congratulate Mr. Elliott from 
New Zealand on the appointment as the new chair. I also wish to thank the Australian 
Government for making various arrangements to host this meeting. I wish to welcome 
Mr. Mae, who has assumed his duties as Deputy Executive Secretary from May this 
year. Mr. Mae's participation, together with the efforts made by Mr. McGregor, 
Executive Secretary, have strengthened the role of the Secretariat and made the smooth 
functioning of the duties possible. I also wish to welcome the observers from Korea, 
Taiwan, ICCAT and CCAMLR. 
 
Now I would like to talk about Japan's basic position on some of the major isues facing 
this meeting. 
 
Non-Party Issue 
 
One of the major developments in SBT fishery since the last year's Commission 
Meeting in September, is the rapid expansion of SBT catch by non-parties. It is thought 
that the estimated annual catch of 2,000 to 2,500 tonnes by non-parties during 1989 to 
1995 has suddenly increased to over 4,000 tonnes in 1996. This is a situation which can 
seriously impact on the SBT stock, which is finally starting to show a trend towards 
recovery. At the same time, this situation can potentially nullify all the efforts made by 
the contracting parties under years of stringent catch restriction measures, which we 
endured in the hope to rebuild the stock. 
 
Therefore, Japan recognizes the early formulation of plans concerning non-parties and 
its fulfillment to be the most important issue facing this year's annual meeting. To be 
more specific, it is necessary to collect more accurate data on fishing activities by 
non-parties and to encourage them to accede to or co-operate with CCSBT. In order to 
achieve these goals, it is important to consider the effectiveness and outlines of a system, 
which enables us to collect more accurate fishing information through international 
trade, and to immediately start working on setting up direct negotiation opportunities 
with non-parties with an aim to facilitate their accession and co-operation. 
 
In reference to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the United 
Nations Implementation Agreement, it is prescribed that non-parties involved in SBT 
fishery are obliged to accede to CCSBT, which is the regional fisheries management 
organization, or co-operate with its conservation measures. Not only is this their 
obligation as members of the international community, but an important prerequisite to 
engage in SBT fishery. 
 
I would like to repeat the previous statement that Japan recognizes the issue of 
non-parties as the most important issue at this Annual meeting. We are willing to 
co-operate with other parties and make all possible efforts to achieve this goal. 
 
EFP, Scientific Committee 
 
Moving on to the Experimental Fishing Program. Based on the agreement at the 
resumed meeting of the Third Annual Commission Meeting, held last February, this 
year's Scientific Committee Meeting did not conduct its usual stock assessment work, 
but instead, worked intensively on Step 1 and 2 of the EFP. The respective steps 
involved the identification of uncertainties in the stock assessment and narrowing down 
of their ranges with a view to conduct EFP and the evaluation on the impact of 
additional catch by EFP on stock recovery. Having dedicated the time to these tasks, 
there was substantial progress in the area of cross-verification of VPAs. However, at the 
last stage of the meeting, problems arose in working out the projections, and much to 
our regret, Step 2 could not be completed. 
 
This development, however, made us feel even more strongly about the need to conduct 
EFP at an early timing. What I mean by this is, there are a number of uncertainties 
identified, and it is clear that EFP can most certainly provide new knowledge relevant to 
hypotheses on the interpretation of CPUEs, which is one of the more important issues. 
The Pilot Program which was submitted at the resumed Commission meeting included a 
pay-back system, and without extensive deliberations, it is apparent that the impact on 
stock recovery is negligible. Under such circumstances, we view CCSBT's inability to 
conduct an experimental fishing program as a serious concern over its responsibility as 
a regional fisheries management organization. In this light, we strongly hope to see 
constructive discussions on this matter at this meeting. 
 
TAC 
 
Since the Third Annual Commission Meeting, Japan has been proposing an increase in 
the Total Allowable Catch by 3,000 tonnes or more. Our nation's fishers have been 
operating under stringent catch restrictions over a prolonged period and the emerging 
trend of stock recovery, which is becoming clear in recent years, is the fruit of their 
efforts. Such efforts should be rewarded by an increase of the quota, and Japan will 
continue to seek an increase in the TAC at this year's meeting. 
 
VPA 
 
The Scientific Committee of CCSBT has been using VPAs in the stock assessment of 
SBT. Currently, VPAs discussed by scientists from Japan, Australia and New Zealand 
incorporate various parameters, and compared to VPAs used world-wide, they are fairly 
complex. Because of this, problems associated with those VPA are also becoming 
apparent. In other words, in order to address various uncertainties in the stock 
assessment, models are becoming increasingly complicated, and slight modifications to 
certain parameters can change the entire picture of the stock, and errors are occurring 
frequently. In addition to this, looking from a layman's perspective, it appears that while 
there is a heavy reliance on computer programs, not enough time and energy are 
directed at collecting biological information and conducting research work. Furthermore, 
the effort by scientists over the year's to produce elaborate programs has not shown any 
definite outcomes. And to be honest, we do not feel very optimistic about the prospect 
of achieving something in the near future by continuing this path. Therefore, although 
the work on VPAs needs to be maintained, we believe that we have reached the point 
where we should consider a shift in the focus of the Scientific Committee which 
includes a change over to new methods of stock assessment. What is important here is 
that the outcomes of the deliberations of the Scientific Committee are derived from 
principles which can be comprehended by the non-scientific population of the society, 
and not from a black box. By making this proposal, I am not hinting at lowering the 
level of scientific discussions. It is based on the belief that, as a responsible regional 
management organization, it is our obligation to present our decisions in a manner 
which can be explained to and appreciated by the general public. 
 
Increased attention from Environmental Groups 
 
Lastly, as we can see from the recently published report by WWF and Traffic Oceania, 
as well as the application for the observer status from Green Peace International, the 
general public's interest in CCSBT's activities is increasing. Claims made by these 
groups are based solely on pessimistic information. We are concerned that not only do 
they fail to reflect CCSBT's views with fairness, but run the risk of creating 
misunderstanding and confusion within the society by stirring up excessive sense of 
crisis. Faced with this situation, Japan believes that CCSBT needs to demonstrate that 
we are a regional fisheries management organization which is functioning effectively. In 
this context, it is critical for us to swiftly achieve substantive progress on major issues I 
talked about earlier, which will, in turn, increase the credibility of our forum. 
 
In concluding my opening remarks, I look forward to constructive discussions and many 
fruitful outcomes. 
 
Thank you.

OPENING STATEMENT - NEW ZEALAND 
 
 
• 
The New Zealand delegation appreciates the opportunity to meet and work with the 
delegations from Australia and Japan, and the staff of the Secretariat, at this, the 
fourth annual meeting of the Commission. In addition, we welcome representatives 
from Indonesia, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan 
 
• 
For the sake of brevity I will summarise New Zealand's country statement, but will 
provide a copy of the full statement for inclusion in the record. 
 
• 
In recent years, meetings of the Commission have been difficult and protracted 
affairs as the parties sought to reconcile differences in approach. While progress 
has been made both within the Commission and in recent working group meetings, 
a number of outstanding issues remain. To resolve these issues, the Commission 
parties will need to listen carefully to the perspective of the other parties, and  
commit to cooperative work at this meeting and subsequently. 
 
• 
Our primary management objective must be an improved stock status-even taking 
into account the different views, the parental biomass is severely depleted and there 
are risks for security of future harvests. We strongly advocate that the Commission 
needs to critically examine both its ability and obligations to respond to the 
scientific differences that exist and the resulting uncertainty. New Zealand is very 
of aware not only our own interests in retrieving the stock situation, but the 
increasing scrutiny applied by both international and domestic fora to the 
performance of the CCSBT. 
 
• 
The hope of the New Zealand delegation is that all parties will build on the 
working relationship and understanding developed in recent meetings to 
constructively progress a number of matters, some of which are outlined below. 
 
Non-Party Accession or Cooperation 
 
• 
Non-party catches and their involvement in the Commission must be a high priority. 
The integrity and function of the Commission is compromised by the current 
situation. New Zealand remains extremely concerned about increasing SBT catch 
by Indonesia and the Republic of Korea. Such expansion is inappropriate given the 
catch restraints applied by Commission parties, in contrary to responsibilities under 
international law and ignores the perilous stock position. New Zealand is 
encouraged by Taiwan's statement in 1996 that Taiwan would restrain its catch 
level to no more than its 1995 level of catch (1 447 tonnes). We believe this is a 
useful step towards the development of a cooperative arrangement with the 
Commission. We strongly urge Indonesia and the Republic of Korea to work with 
the parties with a view to accession to the Convention as soon as is practical. 
 
 
Status of the Stock 
 
• 
New Zealand retains considerable concern about the status of the stock and the 
prospect of stock recovery in the future. The Scientific Committee has estimated 
that the parental stock is 25-38% of the 1980 level of parental biomass and 5-8% of 
the 1960 level of parental biomass. New Zealand scientists believe it is unlikely 
that the sequential increases in juveniles which we have observed in recent years 
will contribute to the parental stock because of the high exploitation rate applied to 
these year classes. 
 
• 
Given this situation, New Zealand strongly advocates that the Commission 
consider adopting management action to enhance the probability of stock recovery.  
This can only be achieved through ensuring overall reductions in the take of SBT 
through restraint of catch taken by non-parties and Commission members. 
 
Experimental Fishing 
 
• 
The Commission undertook to consider experimental fishing at this meeting. This 
consideration was dependent on scientific work in advance of this meeting to be 
done to evaluate the risk which catch in addition to 11 750 tonnes would pose to the 
recovery of the stock. This work has not been completed. 
 
• 
New Zealand considers that completion of the planned work is essential before the 
Commission further considers the implementation of experimental fishing with 
catch in addition to 11 750 tonnes. We question the priority of this issue relative to 
alternative pressing scientific and management issues. Given the disparity of view 
evident in the stock assessment, we fully support the continued efforts of the 
Scientific Committee to address uncertainty and more closely align the approaches 
taken by the respective parties. 
 
Scientific Processes 
 
• 
In August there was less procedural controversy in the Scientific Committee 
meeting than in recent years. Undoubtedly, the workshop on scientific processes 
contributed to that improvement. However ,we have real concerns about the 
approach taken to what should be scientific and objective discussions. 
 
• 
Different outputs and uncertainty in the stock assessment are only part of the 
difficulty. We need to change our approach and examine the process to move 
forward. 
 
• 
In addition to a full stock assessment, the Commission needs to carefully consider 
work that can be undertaken in the coming year to collaboratively advance efforts 
to resolve uncertainty. Such work should be a high priority. 
 
• 
However, fishery assessments will always have a degree of uncertainty. The 
Commission needs to carefully consider how it takes management decisions in the 
face of uncertainty and the lack of consensus in the Scientific Committee. 
• 
New Zealand strongly advocates that the Commission apply the precautionary 
approach-to be more cautious when information is uncertain, unreliable or 
inadequate, and that the absence of adequate scientific information should not be 
used as a reason for postponing of failing to take conservation and management 
measures. 
 
Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
 
• 
The June workshop on ecologically related species served to give direction to the 
work which the three parties can undertake collaboratively to address the issue of 
seabird captures in SBT longline operations. New Zealand strongly advocates that 
continued efforts are made to complete the work of the June workshop. In 
particular, the completion of the eight draft technical papers. A programme of work 
to allow that work to be done in a timely manner should be developed at this 
meeting. 
 
• 
The working group developed a number of recommendations for the consideration 
of the Commission. New Zealand notes that the three parties now require the 
mandatory use of tori lines in their SBT fisheries. New Zealand suggests that the 
Commission adopt a conservation measure to reflect this action. We also strongly 
support that the Commission encourage all non-parties to adopt the mandatory use 
of tori poles during setting operations at least south of 30ºS. 
 
• 
We note that the Scientific Committee recognised the necessity for improving the 
effectiveness of the working group by strengthening its capacity for technical 
evaluations of information. Certainly, New Zealand hopes the Commission will 
also consider this issue at this meeting. 
 
Fisheries Subsidies 
 
• 
On a more generic matter, New Zealand remains concerned at the level of 
over-capacity, and associated subsidies, in world fisheries and the threat that this 
poses to the achievement of fisheries conservation and management. The issue 
continues to pose a real threat to the fulfilment of the management objectives of 
organisations such as the CCSBT's. 
 
• 
New Zealand is please to see that progress on the issue of over-capacity is taking 
place and recognises the important contribution that Japan and the USA have made 
to progressing the establishment of a Technical FAO Working Group on the 
over-capacity issue. 
 
***************** 
 
• 
The New Zealand delegation looks forward to a productive week during which we 
can focus on priority areas with a view to be able to report real progress for our 
efforts. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement - Republic of Korea 
 
 
Thank you, Mr Chairman and distinguished delegates from the member countries and 
non member country. 
 
On behalf of the Korea government, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr 
Chairman and the member countries of CCSBT for inviting us to participate in the 
momentous conference as an observer. 
 
In recent years, the effectuation of UNCLOS and the adoption of the Fish Stocks 
Agreement has made regional organisations play an important role for the conservation 
and management of marine living resources. 
 
Therefore, we hope that CCSBT will become an exemplary fishery organisation for 
making efforts to promote common interest of relevant countries and to manage and 
conserve rationally southern bluefin tunas. 
 
We are well aware that CCSBT has been strenuous to manage rationally southern 
bluefin tunas from the past. My country has also wanted to be a CCSBT member 
country to join this organisation. However, Korea can not have membership to CCSBT 
because the member countries of CCSBT have closed their door and they are not willing 
to open. 
 
Member countries suggested a quota allocation formula for us to accede to CCSBT, but 
we think that the suggestion is unreasonable for a new entrant to join the organisation. 
 
We are facing great difficulties because there is no conclusion between the government 
authorities and the business circles on the quota allocation model suggested by CCSBT. 
 
Korea has considered the accession to CCSBT, if we can secure an appropriate quota 
which would amount to at least about 1,000 MT a year. 
 
I would like to ask for your deep understanding and cooperation to ensure the fishing 
quota proposed by Korea through several channels. 
 
Korea has a keen interest in tuna and tuna-like species, because tuna fisheries comprises 
an important portion in the fishing industry. 
 
Korea has obtained memberships of many international fishery organisations for 
example IOTC, ICCAT, CCAMLR etc and has actively participated in conserving and 
managing fishery resources. Korea also has performed its duties and obligations 
sincerely as a member country. In particular, my country made a great contribution to 
the establishment of IOTC, as an international fishery organisation by depositing the 
tenth instrument of acceptance. 
 
Korea, as one of the major fishing nations in the world, wants to cooperate with the 
CCSBT member countries for the purpose of making sustainable management for 
fishery resources. 
 
Even though we are a non-member country, we have submitted scientific data such as 
CPUE, catches, etc which are necessary for managing southern bluefin tunas and have 
despatched Korean scientists to the scientific committee of CCSBT. 
 
We also intend to have cooperation with the member countries, with the aspects of 
joining the rational conservation and utilisation of southern bluefin tunas. 
 
Finally, I hope this conference will get a great success to be more cooperative between 
member countries and non-member countries. 
 
Thank you

c. If meetings are held more than twelve weeks prior to the Commission Meeting, the 
Secretariat will take the procedure stipulated 6.1 above. 
 
6.3 Past Reports 
 
The Committee agreed that past Commission reports including the report from CCSBT1, 
be translated within the budget and manpower of the Secretariat as a non urgent task as 
time permitted. 
 
It was agreed that as a principle, all formal reports from Commission meetings should 
be translated into both Commission languages. 
 
Agenda Item 7: Proposed Amendment of the 1997 Budget 
 
The Executive Secretary spoke to the Secretariat's paper CCSBT/9709/7. 
 
The Committee endorsed the revised 1997 budget as detailed in the Secretariat's paper, 
noting that many of the changes resulted from decisions by the Commission on work 
programs after the original 1997 budget had been approved. The Committee also noted 
that while the Commission's approval of the program implied that the necessary 
approval of expenditure, this approval did not comply with budgetary guidelines 
(Attachment G of the Resumed CCSBT3 Report). The Committee reaffairmed that these 
 
guidelines should be followed by the Secretariat when revising Commission budgets, 
including funding for new Commission initiatives. 
 
The Committee requested where budget amendments were sought, the Secretariat 
should provide the following information in future to the Finance and Administration 
Committee: 
 
a. 
Comparison of both the originally agreed budget and the revised budget; 
b. 
List of items increased by over 10 percent from original budget; and 
c. 
Reasoning behind changes in each budget item. 
 
The Committee noted that an additional Commission meeting may be held in 1997 and 
that the Secretariat was authorised to draw appropriate funds to cover this meeting in a 
revised 1997 budget. The Finance Committee requested the Secretariat to provide a 
revised 1997 budget to be approved out of session if the additional Commission meeting 
is held. 
 
Agenda Item 8: Draft Budget for 1998 
 
Agenda Item 9: Other Matters 
 
9.1 Preparation of Secretariat Papers for Commission Meetings 
 
New Zealand suggested that papers prepared by the Secretariat for consideration at 
Commission meetings should be distributed well in advance of Commission meetings 
so that they can be considered fully by members prior to the meeting. 
 
In line with New Zealand's suggestion, the Secretariat agreed to distribute papers as far 
in advance of Commission meetings as was practicable. 
 
It was suggested that the Commission should reduce as far as practical the number of 
the documents to be submitted to the meeting. 
 
The Secretariat requested that Japan priorities the papers which they would like to be 
translated and distributed by the Secretariat prior to the meeting. 
 
9.2 Confidentiality of Commission documents 
 
This item was not considered by the Finance Committee and was referred to the 
Commission. 
 
The Meeting finalised its business on 13 September 1997.

Attachment L 
 
OVERVIEW OF 1996/1997 AUSTRALIAN SBT SEASON 
 
 
1. 
Introduction 
 
The Australian SBT Fishery continued to comprise a combination of domestic and 
Japanese effort. The Australian catch for 1996/97 is expected to almost reach the 
national catch allocation of 5265 tonnes by the end of the season (1 December 1997). 
The Japanese quota taken in the AFZ is less than in previous years as Japan chose to 
take only 200 tonnes from Tasmania (down from 400 tonnes in recent years) and a 
further 200 tonnes was set aside for bycatch in the Eastern Tuna & Billfish Fishery 
(ET&BF). The 200 tonne Tasmanian catch has been taken. As the ET&BF is still 
operating a final SBT catch figure is not yet available, however the 200 tonnes is not 
likely to be reached. 
 
2. 
Operational constraints on effort 
 
Voluntary measures 
The ET&BF bycatch limit of 200 tonnes is a voluntary catch limit for Japan given effect 
through the Bilateral Agreement between Japan and Australia. 
 
Regulatory measures 
Domestic operators are managed through ITQs granted as Statutory Fishing Rights 
(SFRs) under the Southern Bluefin Tuna Management Plan 1995. The Plan also sets the 
domestic TAC in line with the decision of the Commission; 5265 tonnes for 1996/97. 
For 1996/97, the fishing year will be 16 December 1996 to 30 November 1997 
following an amendment to the fishing season start date which is now 1 December. 
 
The catching of Japan's quota in the AFZ is managed through the Bilateral Agreement.  
Japan is able to take up to 200 tonnes of SBT from Tasmanian waters and a further 200 
tonnes from the ET&BF. For 1996/97 Japanese vessels were not permitted to fish within 
17nm of Tasmania, an increase from 12nm from 1995/96. 
 
3. 
Catch & Effort 
 
Recent years show major shifts in the structure of the Australian SBT Fishery. Prior to 
1990 almost no Australian quota was taken by longline, however more than half was 
taken by longlining during 1990 to 1994 under the Joint Venture (JV). The JV ceased in 
1995 and surface fishing operations (purse seine/pole & line) have accounted for more 
than 90% of the SBT catch since then. Catches for 1995/96 (5,148 tonnes) and 1996/97 
(currently ~ 5,000 tonnes) have come close to the TAC of 5,265 tonnes. The bulk of the 
catch, slightly over 3,000 tonnes, has gone into tuna farming, with a further ~1,600 
tonnes taken by pole and line fishing. The average fork length at capture of these fish is 
around 100cm. 
 
The remaining SBT (several hundred tonnes) is taken by longline. Catch rates in the 
longline sector have been good during winter months (up to 100 SBT per set) with small 
quantities being caught through to September. Weights of fish were commonly 40 to 
60kg (~ 140cm) and of high quality. 
 
Observer data from Tasmania shows increased representation of small (around 105cm) 
SBT compared with the four previous years, however, very small SBT were absent from 
most catches. This is forth successive year of decline in representation of very small 
SBT.  
 
4. 
Current fleet size and distribution 
 
The domestic fleet is stable with a relatively small number of purse seine and pole and 
line vessels operating from South Australia (around 20 vessels). The bulk of their catch 
is taken in the Great Australian Bight during warmer months (November to March) for 
tuna farming (purse seine) or chilled export (pole & line) to Japan. 
 
Domestic longline vessels (commonly 20 to 30) are generally not dedicated SBT 
catchers and usually fish SBT seasonally and/or along with other tuna species. Catches 
are taken from the east coast of Tasmania up to northern NSW. The fishery is 
predominantly a winter fishery (May to August) and overlaps with Japanese activity. 
 
Japan operated eight vessels round Tasmania during June and July 1997. Up to 52 
Japanese vessels have been operating in the ET&BF targeting yellowfin, big-eye and 
broadbill swordfish, and taking incidental catches of SBT. 
 
5. 
Historic fleet size and distribution 
 
Historically, SBT has been taken by domestic boats adjacent to the western, southern 
and eastern coasts of Australia. However, there has been no significant catch of SBT off 
Western Australia since 1991/92 and catches adjacent to NSW remain low. This is part 
due to the ITQ system which has lead to a redistribution of quota ownership and 
encouraged value adding. Since the advent of tuna farming in South Australia in 1992, 
there has been a progressive domestication of the catch. Pole and line fishing and a 
relatively small amount of longlining continue adjacent to southern and eastern states. 
 
The substantial decline in TAC and the introduction of ITQs in the 1980s lead to a 
reduction in the number of operators and fleet size which have now stabilised. 
 
6. 
Fisheries Monitoring 
 
In-port inspections of domestic longline and pole and line vessels, and monitoring of 
transfers of SBT to tuna farms, continued in 1997. There has been a focus on 
compliance with tori pole regulations (operation albatross) which was successful and 
will likely be repeated in 1998. The length monitoring programme continued both at sea 
and in port with coverage of all fishing areas and methods. This has been extended in 
1997 to include the collection of SBT otoliths 
 
Observer coverage of the Japanese fleet operating adjacent to Tasmania increased to 
50% in 1997. Although this is higher than in previous years and must be viewed in the 
light of a reducing number of vessels (10 in 1996; 8 in 1997) and catch (400 tonnes in 
1996; 200 tonnes in 1997). Pre and post fishing inspections were also maintained.  
Data collection by observers was similar to previous years, with SBT 
measurements/weights and seabird bycatch priority areas. 
 
Compliance with quota allocations has been good to date with all operators remaining 
within quota or leasing quota to cover any unintentional overcatch. The management 
advisory committee for the SBT Fishery recently commenced a review to improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of compliance and monitoring arrangements. The review is 
expected to be completed by March 1998. 
 
7. 
Other Factors 
 
Import/export statistics 
Australia is working to reconcile apparent inconsistencies between Japanese import 
statistics for SBT from Australia and Australian production. 
 
Markets 
The major market for Australian SBT remains Japan with more than 95% of the catch 
sold there. This is almost all fresh chilled SBT with a small amount of frozen longline 
catch. Recently, several hundred tonnes of farmed SBT was transferred to a Japanese 
freezer vessel for export to Japan. 
 
Mitigation 
Australian regulations require that all longline vessels (domestic and Japanese) 
operating in the AFZ carry and use tori poles when operating south of 30 degrees South.  
In 1995 longlining was recognised as a key threatening process for the survival of 
albatross in the AFZ. A draft Threat Abatement Plan will be released for public 
consultation later in 1997 and be implemented in mid 1998.

(2) The 1996 fishing year was ordered to be closed after the setting of longlines on 30 
November. The recorded catch was 6,012 tonnes against the catch limit of 6,065 
tonnes (53 tonnes were not used.). However, after the close of the fishing season, 
the activities of the forty fishing vessels, which were prosecuted for operating 
contrary to the domestic regulation regarding the management of the Japanese 
national allocation on the high seas of the south Indian Ocean (South Indian Ocean 
Fishing Ground) in December last year, led to the national allocation of 6,065 
tonnes being exceeded by 308 tonnes. 
This is as reported in the Commission meeting held in February this year, and the 
excess amount will be reduced from the Japanese national allocation of the 1997 
fishing year.

RTMP Scientific Observer 
(1) In the 1996 fishing year, 15 trips were covered by Japanese observers and the total 
days of observers on board was 869. The total number of trips was same as the 
previous year. However, the total days covered by observers decreased substantially 
compared to the 1995 fishing year because of the shorter period of operations in the 
South Indian Ocean Fishing Ground caused by the early entry into ports of 
Australia for provisioning in the mid October as the difficulties encountered in the 
fisheries consultation between Japan and Australia made the port call to Australia 
difficult after November.

(2) Arrangements in the 1997 fishing year will be similar to those in 1996; there will 
be no research activity outside the normal fishing periods. However, it is intended 
to achieve more observer coverage than in the previous year against the total days 
of operations. For the first half of this fishing year, Japanese observers covered 
three trips outside Tasman AFZ and four trips off South Africa. It is planned that 
observers will cover eight trips in the South Indian Ocean Fishing Ground where 
fishing operations are currently conducted.

Annual Review of New Zealand SBT Fisheries 
 
 
1. 
Introduction 
 
 
Longlining was the predominant method used to take SBT in the New Zealand 
 
Exclusive Economic Zone, although domestic owned and operated vessels also 
 
spent a limited time trolling and handlining for SBT. Domestic SBT fishing was 
 
conducted from March to mid-August 1997 with the total catch 331 tonnes (as at 
 
25 August 1997). 
 
 
Standardised and nominal CPUE for the domestic fishery show a decline in 1996 
 
(of about 40%) relative to 1995 with preliminary information from 1997 suggesting 
 
that CPUE is similar to that in 1996. 
 
2. 
Operational constraints on effort 
 
 
Voluntary measures 
 
 
Regulatory measures 
 
 
Regulations specify an annual catch limit for SBT and make it an offence to take 
 
SBT once the catch limit has been reached. The New Zealand fishing year extends 
 
from 1 October 1997 to 30 September of the following year. The SBT catch limit 
 
for the 1996-97 fishing year was 420 tonnes. 
 
3. 
Catch and Effort 
 
 
Domestic fishing effort exhibited a regular increase in effort from 1992 to 1995 
 
with a subsequent drop in 1996 attributed to very poor catch rates and low fish 
 
quality. The subsequent decrease in fishing effort in 1997 has been attributed to 
 
economic constraints on the domestic fishery although catches have exceeded 330 
 
tonnes. 
 
4. 
Annual fleet size and distribution 
 
 
Whereas New Zealand domestic catches of SBT prior to the advent of longlining 
 
were largely restricted to June to August, the domestic season now extends from 
 
March to August or September. SBT fishing is still largely a winter fishery, despite 
 
some fish being caught throughout the year, with over 90% of all domestic landings 
 
being made from June to August. The domestic fishing pattern contrasts with that 
 
of Japanese foreign licensed vessels, which no longer fish in the EEZ, whose New 
 
Zealand fishing season continually contracted during the 1980s and 1990s. 
 
 
Since the early 1990s nearly all fishing for SBT (> 99%) has been conducted either 
 
off the West Coast of the South Island or off East Cape (east coast North Island). 
 
Early in the 1997 season, some fishing was also conducted off the South 
 
Canterbury-Otago coast, an area not fished since the mid-1990s. Catches were 
 
reported as good. 
 
5. 
Historical fleet size and distribution 
 
 
The New Zealand domestic fishery (Charter and domestic owned and operated 
 
vessels) continues to be dynamic, exhibiting substantial changes each year. In 1997, 
 
vessel number declined substantially, reportedly because of economic constraints, 
 
despite the reactivation of charter arrangements between New Zealand and 
 
Japanese companies. About 30 domestic vessels fished for SBT in 1997 compared 
 
with 60 vessels in 1996. No foreign licensed longliners fished in the EEZ in 1996 
 
or 1997. 
 
6. 
Fisheries Monitoring 
 
 
Observer coverage in 1997 was over 60% with 424 longline sets observed on 
 
chartered and domestic owned and operated vessels. This is a substantial increase 
 
over the previous two years (7% in 1996 and 10% in 1995) observer coverage of 
 
the domestic fishery. 
 
 
RTMP coverage declined in 1997 owing to a decrease in domestic fishing effort 
 
(31 boats in 1997 compared 50 in 1996 and 57 in 1995). This represents a decline 
 
in days fished to less than 800. Weight and length measurements supplied by 
 
RTMP vessels remain high with 3410 SBT weighed and 3409 SBT measured for 
 
length. 
 
 
Biological information is collected by the Ministry of Fisheries Observer 
 
Programme. In 1997 samples were collected for genetic reference material to 
 
distinguish southern bluefin from northern bluefing tuna. Genetic samples were 
 
also collected from swordfish for a Japanese research project to delineate stock 
 
structure. Observers also facilitated the recovery of tags from a CSIRO tagging 
 
programme. 
 
 
The New Zealand SBT fishery is managed by a competitive catch limit. The 
 
Ministry of Fisheries uses two sources to monitor the SBT catch limit. The first is 
 
be a programme which requires licensed fish receivers and larger vessels which 
 
freeze their catch to submit weekly reports of catch to the Ministry. Catch reported 
 
by this system is verified the Ministry's catch and effort system. 
 
7. 
Other factors 
 
 
Import/export statistics 
 
 
Markets 
 
 
 
 
Mitigation 
 
 
New Zealand regulations specify that all tuna longline vessels are required to use 
 
seabird scaring devices. The minimum standard for the bird scaring devices that 
 
specified by CCAMLR for tori lines. The New Zealand fishing industry have a 
 
voluntary code of practice advocating that tuna longline gear is set at night.

Review of SBT Fisheries - Taiwan 
 
 
1. 
Taiwan still set the catch limit for SBT. 
 
The annual catch limit for 1996 was 1,450 MT. 
 
2. 
All the SBT catched by Taiwan fleet was exported to Japan. 
 
According to the document which was circulated in this conference, in 1996, the 
 
volume was 1,397 MT for Taiwan exporting to Japan.

2) What is the survival rate of SBT in the farms as sourced by pole and line/purse 
seine? 
 
The figures for pole and line/ purse seine are not distinguishable. After counting into the 
farms the average mortality is about 5%. Average time in pens between 3-5 months.  
Losses are mainly due to seals, parasites and storms. (Source TBOAA).

4) What is the observer coverage for the domestic fleet? 
 
There is no formal at-sea observer program for the domestic SBT fleet, although the 
length monitoring program has an at-sea component. AFMA runs a farm monitoring 
program where all the transfers from towing cages to fish farms are observed. The 
compliance review of the SBT Fishery (reported in agenda item 7, CCSBT 4) will be 
considering the need for more formal observer programs to monitor off-shore SBT 
operations.

Personal Comments regarding Scientific Committee Process 
 
 
• 
I was often disappointed and frustrated at the slow progress and lack of agreed 
outcome at the Scientific Committee. 
 
• 
There often appeared to be a lack of goodwill between the Parties and the lack of 
desire to reach an agreed outcome. 
 
• 
I am concerned because I believe that the slow progress and lack of agreed 
outcome could jeopardise the continuation of the scientific process of the 
Commission, and perhaps jeopardise the continued existence of the Commission 
in its present form. 
 
• 
CCSBT needs to make progress in the stock assessment and management of SBT 
to retain its credibility in this area. 
 
• 
Other international fisheries agencies can and do reach agreement in the 
assessment and management of shared stocks. 
 
• 
CCSBT needs to take steps to ensure that the slow progress and lack of agreed 
outcomes of the Scientific Committee are overcome. 
 
• 
The Scientific Processes Workshop held in May 1997 made positive suggestions 
to address some of the problems experienced by the Scientific Committee. 
 
• 
However, there needs to be the will and commitment of all parties to CCSBT to 
make the scientific process more effective. 
 
• 
New Zealand is reviewing its current level of commitment to the Scientific 
Committee, and unless substantive progress can be made, it will consider 
substantially reducing its involvement in the Scientific Committee in the near 
future. 
 
 
 
 
 
Dr John Annala 
Chair, Scientific Committee 
Attachment S 
 
Australia's Statement on the Scientific Committee Report (Agenda Item 10.1) 
 
 
Australia thanked Dr. Annala and the external scientists for their contribution to the 
Scientific Committee. It noted that agreement that had been reached on otolith 
collecting and age estimation and hoped that the Commission would endorse the 
proposed work. 
 
Australia noted its concern that the focus on Steps 1 & 2 meant that inadequate 
consideration was given to information that did not directly fit within the VPA and 
projection framework. In particular, it noted that 
 
a) 
juvenile CPUE which had started increasing in 1987-88 had peaked in 1993 and 
 
was now declining; 
 
b) 
that although the catch rates for recent juvenile cohorts were higher than any 
 
cohorts since 1980, the catch rates for these cohorts has declined rapidly as they 
 
aged. As such, their potential to contribute to future rebuilding of the spawning 
 
stock is less than initially anticipated. These rapid declines in CPUE by cohort have 
 
occurred even though substantially less catch has been taken from them. 
 
Australia noted that some progress had been made since the end of the Scientific 
Committee meeting but was disappointed that Steps 1 and 2 had not been completed. It 
noted the progress and commitment made to resolving the computational problems that 
had occurred at the end of Scientific Committee Meeting and considered that the 
collaborative efforts to resolve these problems should continue as part of the 
intersessional work program for 1997/98. 
 
Australia noted that the reliability of any stock assessment ultimately depends upon the 
completeness and integrity of the underlying catch and effort data. Australia is 
increasingly concerned about the growing uncertainty and level of reliability of the 
catch and effort data. Australia also shared the Scientific Committee Chair's concern 
about the scientific process at the Scientific Committee meeting. It was also concerned 
about the lack of consideration given to whether all of the various VPA models were 
consistent with the available data (i.e. lack of reality checking). 
 
Japan's Statement on the Scientific Committee Report (Agenda Item 10.1) 
 
Japan thanked the Scientific Committee Chair and acknowledged the contribution made 
by the external scientists. At the end of the process discrepancies between the Australian 
and Japanese models had meant that Steps 1 & 2 were not completed. Post-meeting 
informal processes had sought to narrow the discrepancies and had seen some 
convergence of views for some areas but not all. Japan tends to continue to seek to solve 
these technical problems to achieve a harmonised approach by CCSBT5. 
 
In order to progress Steps 1 & 2 Japan seeks advice from the Commission: 
 
a) 
with respect to differences in the calculation of results; 
 
b) 
on resolving weightings (which are influenced by individual scientists and parties) 
 
c) 
on modifying the current process of undertaking independent calculations then 
 
collaboratively examining discrepancies and attempting to reconcile these (a 
 
collaborative approach towards calculation is merited); 
 
d) 
on pursuing alternative approaches (other than VPA) to improve the robustness of 
 
the model. 
 
Japan was disappointed with the inability of the Scientists to complete Steps 1 & 2 and 
agreed with many of the personal comments express by Dr Annala. It sought a 
commitment from the Scientists to a timetable and work plan to complete Steps 1 & 2. 
 
New Zealand Statement on the Scientific Committee (Agenda Item 10.1) 
 
New Zealand has serious ongoing concerns about the status of the SBT stock. We also 
have continuing concerns about our ability to adequately model trends in SBT stock 
status. Reconciliation of differences in VPA modelling will be an area of ongoing 
development for the Parties. We are also concerned to ensure that the models used 
adequately reflect the signals observable in the fisheries for SBT. 
 
We noted with interest Japan's comment in their opening statement that a wider range of 
stock assessment methods than are currently used should be considered. While New 
Zealand has supported this approach for some time, we also consider that changes to 
stock assessment approaches must be considered in the context of the information 
requirements of the Commission. 
 
We are also concerned that the Commission in its current reliance on VPAs and focus on 
projections doesn't lose sight of the fact that many of the scientific papers prepared for 
the last meeting of the scientists contained signs that cause us to continue our concern 
over stock status. 
 
Of key concern to us are the following indicators of stock status which we observed in 
the papers presented to the scientific meeting: 
 
a) 
Parental abundance indices (8+ year olds) have steadily declined from 1969 to 
 
1996 to about 17% of their former level. This trend is independent of assumptions 
 
about unfished areas. CCSBT-SC/9707/14 and CCSBT-SC/9707/19. 
 
b) 
Increases in CPUE in the global Japanese fishery in the early 1990s have not 
 
persisted and CPUE has steadily declined to 1996. CCSBT-SC/9707/11. 
 
c) 
Juvenile abundance indices are dependent on assumptions about abundance in 
 
unfished areas and most models indicate an increase from about 1990 to 1993.  
 
Since 1993, however, there is no evidence of continuing increases in juvenile 
 
abundance. CCSBT-SC/9707/14 and CCSBT-SC/9707/19. 
 
d) 
The abundance of juveniles appears to have declined in all fisheries off eastern 
 
Tasmania resulting in a failure of the troll fishery in 1996 and 1997. CCSBT-
 
SC/9707/6. 
 
e) 
In the New Zealand area SBT abundance appears to be fluctuating at about 20% of 
 
1980 levels. CCSBT-SC/9707/9. 
 
f) 
Recruitment into the New Zealand fishery evident in the late 1980s and early 1990s 
 
has declined from the mid-1990s through to 1997 to very low levels (<1-5%).  
 
CCSBT/96/2, CCSBT-SC/9707/9 and CCSBT-SC/9707/10. 
 
We are concerned that unlike previous meetings, we were only able to detect some 
hopeful signs in model results, and then only in those models which were in our view 
less likely. Whatever modelling approach(es) the Commission takes we consider it 
essential that reality checks be applied to ensure that the results are not misleading.  
There was insufficient time to apply such checks during the last scientific meeting and 
the ones we have applied subsequently raise grave concerns for us not only with respect 
to the parental stock but also with respect to the potential for the juveniles to replenish 
the severely depleted parental biomass.

Scientific Committee Workplan for 1997-98 
 
 
1.  A workplan was developed by considering a range of issues including completion 
 
of step1 and 2 and carrying out a full stock assessment for 1998. 
 
2.  A range of problems were identified in order to complete steps 1 and 2 within the 
 
next 6-9 months. If these problems are not resolved within this time frame, new 
 
data and scientific developments would have to be included to be able to provide 
 
the Commission with the best available scientific advice. 
 
3.  The problems and their potential resolution were: 
 
 
(a) Computational and model implementation problems that can be solved.  
 
 
The workplan includes intersessional work that should resolve these by  
 
 
February 1. 
 
 
 
(b) Not all the uncertainties can be included in the analyses conducted by all 
 
 
parties (eg alternative catch histories) 
 
 
 
(c) Parties can presently provide their own interpretation for weightings based 
 
 
on the same data and information and no method has been developed to  
 
 
objectively integrate these to provide an overall answer. 
 
 
Because (b) and (c) are constrained by factors outside of the scientific process, the 
 
group concluded that there was little prospect of completing steps 1 and 2 before 
 
the next scientific committee meeting. 
 
4.  A timetable leading up to next year's stock assessment group and scientific 
 
committee meetings has been developed. 
 
5.  The otolith collection and archiving program as agreed in the 1997 Scientific 
 
Committee meeting is included in the workplan. 
 
 
Scientific Committee Workplan for 1997-98 
 
 
The following workplan presents the main collaborative work required by CCSBT to 
meet the objectives of completing the computational and implementation problems 
relevant to steps 1 and 2 and providing a full stock assessment for 1998. It does not 
include the extensive program of research which will be conducted to support the 
assessments or the related SBT research to be conducted intersessionally by individual 
members. 
 
Intersessional work 
 
The following work was identified as high priority and includes agreed target dates for 
completion: 
 
1. 
Evaluate and develop output weight procedure by exchanging reviews and 
comments on SC/9707/29 
 
 
- by January 1, 1998 
2. 
Resolving remaining computational differences in VPAs and projections 
 
 
- by February 1, 1998 (starting from now until resolved) 
3. 
Process for handling differences in implementation 
 
 
- by February 1, 1998 (starting from now until resolved) 
4. 
Discuss planned stock assessment for 1998 including alternative methods for VPA 
 
and projections 
 
 
- possibly telephone conference in April, 1998 or tack on to existing meeting 
5.

Database format maintained in the Secretariat. 
(Proposal by the Secretariat in collaboration with Japan) 
 
 
The following three types of data sets are essential for the Secretariat to provide 
fundamental information on SBT fishery in responding to a potential range of questions 
from outside scholars, individuals and international and intergovernment organizations: 
 
 - 
Catch and effort data : SBT catch in number and weight and effort expressed in 
 
hooks number used for longline fishery and in number of operating days for the 
 
other fisheries by 5 degrees square and month, fishery and party. All catch and 
 
effort within SBT Statistical Area as well as square where SBT caught outside of 
 
SBT Statistical Area should be covered. 
 Format: Year/Month/Party/Fishery code/Lat./Lon./SBT Area/SBT catch in 
 
number/SBT catch in weight/Effort 
 
 -  Size data : SBT size distribution of catch by SBT Statistical Area, month, fishery 
 
and party. 
 Format: Year/Month/Party/Fishery code/SBT Area/Size code (L or W)/Size/Frequency 
 
 - 
Trade statistics: All SBT trade information available should be included. 
 Format: Year/Month/Source code/Importing party/Exporting party/Amount of 
 
trade/Type of product 
 
All members are required to provide the above mentioned three types of data for the 
most recent year as well as any revision when necessary in agreed format on annual 
basis. 
 
The Secretariat should 
 - 
update data sets with data provided from all parties, 
 - 
monitor and instruct an appropriate and timely provision of data by members, and 
 - 
ask and encourage non-member SBT fishing parties to provide the same data in the 
 
agreed format. 
 
In addition to the data mentioned above, the members and non-member SBT fishing 
parties should report total SBT catch made in the most recent year with the Secretariat 
maintaining these figures. 
 
The expected size of data should be handled with any general database software 
currently available. The data should be kept in large capacity recording devices such as 
ZIP and MO and access to the data should be carefully monitored to secure 
confidentiality. When the information regarding the SBT fishery would be requested, 
the Secretariat should provide the necessary information in an appropriate form under 
the instruction and approval of the Commission. The type of information include: 
 - 
seasonal and annual change of SBT catch and effort in global as well as in specific 
 
area, 
 - 
comparison of trend in SBT catch and effort among different fisheries and different 
 
parties, and 
 - 
size of fish caught by fishery and/or by party as well as historical change in size of 
 
catch. 
 
Costs required would be: 
 - 
purchase of data base software:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
$ 1,500 
 - 
purchase of additional hardware for large capacity recording devices: $ 2,000 
 -
