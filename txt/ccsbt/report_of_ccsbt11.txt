Report of the Extended Commission of the 
Eleventh Annual Meeting of the Commission 
19-22 October 2004 
Busan, Republic of Korea 
 
Agenda Item 1. 
Opening of meeting 
1.1 Election of Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended Commission of the 
Eleventh Meeting of the Commission 
1. 
The Chair of CCSBT 11 (Mr Ki Hiok Barng) welcomed participants to the third 
meeting of the Extended Commission and declared the meeting open. 
2. 
The Executive Secretary outlined the primary matters that the Extended Commission 
would be considering at this meeting. 
 
1.2 Adoption of agenda 
3. 
A revised agenda was adopted and is included at Attachment 1. 
4. 
The list of meeting participants is included at Attachment 2. 
5. 
The list of documents submitted to the meeting is at Attachment 3.  
 
1.3 Opening statements 
1.3.1 Members 
6. 
Opening statements by members of the Extended Commission are at Attachment 4. 
 
1.3.2 Cooperating non-members 
7. 
The opening statement of the Philippines is at Attachment 5. 
 
1.3.3 Other States and entities 
8. 
South Africa presented an opening statement, which is at Attachment 6. 
 
Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
9. 
Members noted the report from the Secretariat (CCSBT-EC/0410/04).   
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Report from the Finance and Administrative Committee 
2 
10. The Executive Secretary briefly introduced papers CCSBT-EC/0410/05 and 
CCSBT-EC/0410/06 concerning the revised budget for 2004 and draft budget for 
2005.  Detailed consideration of these papers and preparation of budgets was 
referred to the Finance and Administrative Committee (FAC). 
11. New Zealand expressed concern at escalating costs in the budget and noted that the 
Commission should concentrate resources where it more directly contributed to 
improving our understanding of the stock and its management rather than on 
meetings. 
12. The FAC was convened to consider the revised budget for 2004 and the proposed 
budget for 2005 (these are at Attachment 7).   Australia was nominated to Chair this 
meeting.  The Commission accepted the revised budget for 2004 and the following 
items were considered in accepting a revised budget for 2005. 
• In 2005, a special consultation meeting will be held following the next MP 
workshop in Canberra (with a 1-day break in between these meetings).   
• It was agreed to use only sufficient cash reserves to balance the difference 
between expenditure and income.  Accordingly, the cash reserve required was 
reduced from $150,000 to $83,986 by, among other things, the use of Australia’s 
tagging money contribution to offset member contributions, deferring the 
ERSWG meeting to 2006 and removing the budget line item ‘Intersessional work 
on SRP’.   $32,000 had been set aside in the 2005 budget for intersessional work 
on SRP, so in removing this item from the revised 2005 budget, any future 
requirement for this will be met from the cash reserve. 
• Australia has provided $50,223 to offset member contributions for the 2005 
budget, but this will not continue beyond 2005 as Australia would like to use the 
money in other areas such as Indonesian port monitoring, recruitment monitoring 
and an international observer program. 
• The next ERSWG meeting will be deferred to early 2006, which Taiwan will host, 
with the cost of the meeting venue to be borne by Taiwan (a saving of $9,000 in 
the 2006 budget).  The deferral of this meeting from 2005 to 2006 will yield a 
significant saving in the 2005 budget. 
• The FAC noted that there would only be a standard range of meetings in 2006 so 
it was unlikely that the Extended Commission would be required to access the 
cash reserve that year.   
• Further savings were realised by funding one Indonesian delegate (instead of two) 
at the 2005 Commission and SC meetings and none for the next SAG meeting. 
• The Extended Commission requested the Secretariat to keep a ‘watching brief’ on 
increased costs on items such as the tagging program, consider other savings not 
already identified and review the budget again in mid-2005.  
• Finally, it was agreed that there is a need to hold costs and duration of all 
meetings under review. 
13. Taiwan noted that a comparison of budgets calculated by the Secretariat, 
demonstrated a difference between holding the Management Procedure Workshop 
and the management consultation in Canberra and in Taipei was about $60,650.  
3 
Taiwan indicated that it would be able to provide funding for this sum as a special 
contribution to the Extended Commission. However, considering a commitment 
given to Australia, to have the workshop held in Canberra, it was willing to give up 
the opportunity of hosting the Management Procedure Workshop and special 
consultation following the MP workshop. Taiwan indicated that this was a very 
special case, and should not set a precedent for future practice. 
14. Korea noted that it was only utilising a small proportion of its national allocation of 
the TAC, but that its financial contribution to the CCSBT does not incorporate any 
discount factor for the conservation value of this non utilised allocation.  Korea 
would like this to be considered at CCSBT 12. 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Relationship with Non-members 
15. The Executive Secretary presented the report on the relationship with non-members 
(CCSBT-EC/0410/07). 
4.1 Indonesia 
16. Discussion in relation to Indonesia was conducted under agenda item 17. 
 
4.2 South Africa 
17. South Africa intends to develop an SBT fishery with a voluntary limit of 250 tonnes. 
It was noted that South Africa as a party to the United Nations Fish Stocks 
Agreement should not enter the fishery unless it first accedes to the Convention or 
otherwise applies the conservation and management measures of the CCSBT. 
18. The meeting recognised that South Africa’s catch history and status as a range state 
gave it rights to an SBT catch allocation from the CCSBT.  Members discussed the 
appropriate level of allocation and views ranged from the 30 tonnes agreed at 
CCSBT 10 to not providing an allocation and instead, observing the development of 
South Africa’s fishery and advising South Africa of the CCSBT’s concern with the 
expansion of SBT fishing by South Africa. 
19. The Extended Commission agreed that it did not want to place South Africa in a 
position where it might fish in a manner inconsistent with the conservation and 
management measures of the CCSBT.   
 
4.3 Philippines 
20. Members of the Extended Commission welcomed the Philippines as a Cooperating 
Non-Member of the Extended Commission. 
21. The Philippines advised that it was pleased to be accepted as a Cooperating Non-
Member and that it will strive to comply with all the conservation and management 
measures adopted by the Extended Commission.  The Philippines also advised that it 
4 
wished to further develop its distant water fishing fleet and to become a full member 
of the Commission in the future. 
 
4.4 Others 
22. Concern was expressed that China was expanding its fishing capacity and that 
therefore, the Extended Commission needed to observe future catches by China. 
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Review of SBT Fisheries 
23. Reports on the SBT fisheries of members of the Extended Commission and 
Cooperating Non-Members are included at Attachment 8. 
24. Members of the Extended Commission discussed the level of scientific observer 
coverage that they were achieving and the nature of difficulties being experienced in 
achieving the target level.  For future national reports, the Extended Commission 
requested that members report observer coverage levels in accordance with the 
Scientific Observer Standards so that performance against the target could be 
properly assessed. 
25. Members agreed that all sources of SBT mortality (e.g. discards, recreational fishing) 
and the breakdown of domestic consumption versus exports should be included in 
national fishery reports presented to the Extended Commission.  The standard report 
should be amended accordingly. 
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
26. The Chair of the Scientific Committee (SC), Mr Penney presented the stock status 
and management advice arising from the Fifth Meeting of the Stock Assessment 
Group and the Ninth Meeting of the Scientific Committee.  The report of the Ninth 
meeting of the Scientific Committee and its Extended Scientific Committee (SC9) is 
provided at Attachment 9.  The stock status and management advice is shown at 
paragraph 20 and paragraphs 23-28 respectively of the SC9 report. 
27. In response to the presentation from the SC9 report, the following main questions 
and issues were raised: 
• Stock projections under constant catch: It was noted that, even in the low 
productivity scenarios, SBT spawner biomass would not be expected to decline to 
zero as most fisheries, particularly longline fisheries, would be forced to withdraw 
from the fishery for economic reasons before this occurred. 
• Recruitment uncertainty: Developing reliable estimates of recruitment has been 
recognised as a high priority by the SC.  It is hoped that the 2005 review of the 
expanded list of indicators, together with the comprehensive evaluation of 
sensitivity tests around the MP operating model at the MP4 workshop 
5 
(particularly those related to low recruitment) will provide information on the 
impact of different recruitment scenarios on MP behaviour.  
• Information required to improve understanding in 2005: Every effort needs to be 
made to collect, provide and exchange all the data required to develop the 
expanded list of indicators recommended by SC9 to be evaluated in 2005.  In 
particular, emphasis should be placed on: 
o Aerial and acoustic surveys of juvenile abundance; 
o Tag recovery, and improvement of observer coverage to improve estimates of 
tag reporting rates; 
o Collection of representative catch-at-size data for all fishery sectors, and 
collection and reading of otoliths to provide representative catch-at-age data for 
all fleets, including the Indonesian fishery; and 
o Provision of data and information on operational changes in longline fleet 
fishing patterns that may have affected CPUE and fleet distribution, 
particularly information regarding targeting changes, discard rates and by-catch 
of other species. 
• Australia encouraged members to increase the international observer coverage on 
their vessels. 
• Understanding reasons for observed trends: Information and opinions from 
fishermen should be considered when interpreting observed trends in the fishery, 
to assist in understanding possible operational reasons for these trends.  In 
particular, any available information on economic factors or market-preferences 
needs to be considered to ascertain how these may have affected targeting or size 
composition of landed catch. 
• Influence of environmental factors: The possible role of environmental factors, 
particularly water temperature, needs to be considered when evaluating possible 
reasons for changes in fleet distribution, or apparent range contractions of SBT. 
• Design of ‘Meta-Rules’: The Extended Commission recommended that SC10 
develop meta-rules that could be used to identify ‘exceptional circumstances’ 
(such as continued low recruitment).  The rules will need to include clear and 
objective definitions of such exceptional circumstances, as well as proposed 
responses.  SC10 will be expected to provide clear advice on how to rebuild the 
stock under such circumstances. 
• Advice on appropriate catch reductions: It is difficult for the Commission to take 
decisions on appropriate levels of catch reduction to rebuild the SBT stock 
without clear scientific advice in this regard.  Any SC recommendations on the 
possible need for catch reduction should include evaluations of the likely effect of 
various alternate levels of reduction, and estimates of uncertainty around these 
predictions. 
28. The general views of the Extended Commission in relation to the stock status and 
management  advice from SC9 were summarised as: 
• The Extended Commission is concerned about the state of the SBT stock and 
recognises that the next 12 months is critical to the state of the fishery; 
6 
• The Extended Commission recognises that when it makes decisions in response to 
the advice from the SC, such as TAC reductions, they could have serious impacts 
on industry and related communities, and the Extended Commission is aware of 
these impacts; 
• Members would like an increased level of certainty about the scientific advice 
before the Extended Commission would make a decision for a large change in 
TAC, nevertheless the Extended Commission is prepared to make the necessary 
decision(s); 
• The research priorities identified by SC9 for 2004/05 to better evaluate the 
indications of recent low recruitment were fully endorsed by the Extended 
Commission. 
29. The Chair of the Scientific Committee reported on the progress with the Scientific 
Research Program as documented in Item 8 of the report of SC9.  He also presented 
key conclusions regarding the requirements for further work in 2004/05, including 
the workplan and options for finalising the Management Procedure. 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Management Measures 
7.1 Management strategy for the 2004/2005 fishing season 
30. Members noted the advice of SC9 concerning the status of the SBT stock. It was 
agreed that the Extended Commission was confronting a difficult situation that it 
must take seriously and address in a responsible manner. 
31. The Extended Commission agreed that in the light of the advice from SC9 on the 
status of the SBT stock, that it should have a coherent and committed plan for 
managing the fishery in the 2004/2005 fishing season. In particular, members should 
make every effort to respond to the data requirements identified by SC9 to enable the 
scientific processes in 2005 to be completed satisfactorily. 
32. The Extended Commission also agreed that it was important that appropriate 
management measures be pursued for the 2004/2005 fishing season, which 
addressed the issues raised by SC9 in relation to the status of the SBT stock. 
33. A range of activities and their importance were identified for this purpose. These are 
outlined in Attachment 10. 
 
7.2 Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
34. This agenda item was discussed in two parts. 
• Total allowable catch and national allocations for members; and 
• Catch limits for cooperating non-members. 
35. Members noted that a decision on an adjustment of the TAC would have significant 
impacts on the fishery and the communities that relied on it. Any decision to reduce 
the TAC as a management response could not, therefore be taken lightly and must be 
7 
taken on the best scientific advice. It was noted that evidence of low recruitment was 
cause for serious concern but that additional data is needed to confirm whether this is 
a continuing event. This evidence was expected to be available from the 
deliberations of the SC10. 
36. In this context it was agreed that the TAC for members would be maintained at 
14,030 tonnes and the 2003/04 allocations to members would be continued in the 
2004/05 fishing season. 
37. However, Australia noted that, due to the negative assessment of the stock by SC9, 
and that at the 2003 Annual Meeting of the Extended Commission 12 months was 
considered a suitable lead time for implementing TAC changes, a reduction in TAC 
and national allocations may be considered by the Extended Commission for the 
fishing season 2005/06 if the Report of the SC10 continues to indicate low 
recruitment. 
38. New Zealand noted that if the SC10 confirmed continued low recruitments to the 
SBT fishery, the Extended Commission should be prepared to take action to address 
the matter at CCSBT 12 including likely reductions to the TAC. 
39. For cooperating non-members it was considered that the same restraint was required 
to that being asked of by members. Therefore: 
• For the Philippines it was agreed to maintain a catch limit of 50 tonnes; 
• An offer of 30 tonnes would be made to South Africa; and 
• The catch limit to be used for Indonesia in future negotiations over cooperating 
non-membership would be no greater than 800 tonnes. 
40. The offer to South Africa would indicate that the Extended Commission believed the 
amount of 30 tonnes was sufficient for initial implementation of its tuna longline 
fishery as advised to the Extended Commission. The advice would also indicate that 
progress in the development of the South African fishery would be monitored and 
future catch limits be established in the light of the management and conservation 
measures of the Extended Commission. 
41. The Philippines accepted the catch limit of 50 tonnes but observed that rejection of 
its proposal to increase its catch limit to 70 tonnes might send a message to other 
developing countries about the Extended Commission’s willingness to embrace their 
legitimate aspirations. 
42. The Extended Commission reaffirmed its decision at CCSBT 10 that there is an 
outstanding issue with respect to adjustment of national allocations as set out in the 
Mutual Understanding reached at CCSBT 1 and that this issue should be resolved no 
later than CCSBT 11 in the context of the future consideration of the TAC, national 
allocations and decision rules for the management procedure (Paragraphs 52 –54 of 
the CCSBT 10 Report). 
43. The Extended Commission welcomed the paper it had requested in paragraph 54 of 
the Report of CCSBT 10 on this subject, which New Zealand submitted to the 
meeting (CCSBT-EC/0410/25).  It agreed that the issue should be resolved before 
the implementation of the management procedure. 
8 
44. The Extended Commission noted that decision rules for allocating the TAC derived 
from the management procedure need to be agreed prior to the introduction of the 
management procedure.  The Extended Commission agreed that rules shall take into 
account the allocation principles reflected in the CCSBT 1 Mutual Understanding. 
45. The Extended Commission decided that agreement on these rules should be 
developed through inter-sessional contact and decided by CCSBT 12. (A proposal 
from New Zealand for Decision Rules concerning Allocation of TAC is at 
Attachment 11). 
46. The Extended Commission agreed that if it takes a decision on the TAC prior to the 
introduction of the management procedure it shall apply the rules to its decision. 
 
7.3 Other measures 
47. Japan presented its proposal (CCSBT-EC/0410/26) to amend CCSBT’s “Resolution 
on Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported Fishing (IUU) and Establishment of a 
CCSBT Record of Vessels over 24 meters Authorised to Fish for Southern Bluefin 
Tuna” by removing the vessel size limit of 24 metres.  Japan also indicated it would 
change its domestic regulations to expand the application of the resolution to fresh as 
well as frozen southern bluefin tuna. 
48. The meeting noted that the removal of the vessel size limit would impose additional 
administrative burdens on Australia and New Zealand who would have to provide 
significantly larger lists of vessels authorised to take SBT. 
49. The Extended Commission approved the modified resolution, which is at 
Attachment 12. 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Management Procedure 
50. The Chair of the Scientific Committee, Mr Penney presented the advice from SC9 on 
options for further development of the management procedure. 
51. The Extended Commission agreed on option “B” from paragraph 120 of the SC9 
report for further development of the management procedure.  It was considered that 
this option gave the highest chance of completing the management procedure 
development in time for CCSBT 12.  Option “B” required a fourth management 
procedure workshop in May 2005 and it was agreed that this meeting and a special 
consultation meeting would be held in Canberra. 
52. All members expressed concern at the delay in completing the development of the 
management procedure and the Extended Commission agreed to instruct SC10 to 
complete the work for consideration at CCSBT 12. 
53. The Chair of the Scientific Committee requested that participants provide feedback 
to the SC on their preferences for management procedure performance by 
completing an exercise of ranking the performance of 4 different management 
procedures for 20 different realisations of the fishery. 
9 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Funding Formula 
54. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/0410/12 on options for 
amending the CCSBT funding formula. 
55. The Extended Commission agreed not to amend the funding formula noting that 
such an amendment would require an amendment to the Convention, which would 
be difficult to achieve in a short timeframe. 
56. Members considered that financial disincentives to developing countries acceding to 
the Convention such as Indonesia and the Philippines were an important issue.  In 
this context, New Zealand advised that it was considering alternative mechanisms to 
address the issue without requiring an amendment to the Convention and suggested 
that other members could do the same. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Catch Monitoring System 
57. CCSBT 10 requested that the Secretariat prepare a paper on catch monitoring 
options for the CCSBT and the Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-
EC/0410/13 which provided 5 options for a catch monitoring system. 
58. Members considered the paper useful, but there was no consensus on a catch 
monitoring option for the fishery: 
• Japan preferred the status quo (option “1”) because they did not consider that any 
of the options would result in improved scientific data; and 
• The other members preferred option “3” which retained existing systems but 
increased the catch reporting frequency from members to a monthly basis because 
they thought that the fishery need to be monitored more closely for reasons 
additional to scientific purposes. 
59. Australia also emphasised the need for accurate and timely reporting of domestic 
consumption in order to provide a more complete picture of SBT trade and catch. 
60. New Zealand supported a proposal by Australia that the Extended Commission 
should move towards a catch documentation system similar to that in other Regional 
Fisheries Management Organisations and standardised global catch monitoring. 
61. Korea expressed its concern that the CCSBT needs to have a system that is 
compatible with the four other tuna related Regional Fisheries Management 
Organisations. 
62. The meeting agreed to consider the matter again at CCSBT 12. 
63. Members welcomed the offer from the Philippines that it would be willing to 
improve its catch monitoring system as much as possible. 
 
10 
Agenda Item 11. 
Admission of New Members 
64. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/0410/14 which presented 
options on the admission of new members.   
65. Members noted that in the context of the circumstances of the fishery including that 
it is fully exploited and that existing members have made sacrifices there were 
significant impediments to new entrants into the fishery.  Consideration of new rules 
for the admission of new members was not an urgent matter.  
66. The Extended Commission therefore agreed that for the moment, Article 18 of the 
Convention provided sufficient criteria to guide the Extended Commission on the 
admission of new members. 
67. New Zealand noted that the Convention’s Article 8(4) contains allocation principles 
and that it did not see value in creating an alternative set of criteria for new members, 
but that, from an administrative point of view, process guidelines for engaging with 
potential new members may be useful. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Indonesian Catch Monitoring 
68. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/0410/12 which provided 
background on catch monitoring in Indonesia. 
69. Members agreed that it was extremely important that the catch monitoring system in 
Indonesia be continued and all members were prepared to consider arrangements for 
continued funding of the monitoring.  Some members considered that funding should 
be arranged through the CCSBT budget. 
70. Japan advised that it was investigating a bilateral approach with Indonesia for 
continuing current data collection in Benoa and Jakarta.  The meeting agreed that 
any discussions with Indonesia to ensure the continuation of the monitoring program 
should be continued and that the final funding mechanism would be agreed 
intersessionally. 
71. Australia advised that it was happy to participate in funding arrangements that Japan 
developed.  New Zealand said it would be willing to consider contributing funding 
but only where data collection was conducted as part of a scientific program of the 
Extended Commission. 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Quota Trading 
72. The Executive Secretary presented the paper on quota trading (CCSBT-EC/0410/16) 
that included independent legal advice from Bill Edeson on quota trading together 
with a discussion paper on quota trading in the CCSBT context.  New Zealand 
submitted a legal opinion in response to the request in paragraph 56 of the CCSBT 
10 report.  Some delegations noted that both opinions state that the Commission 
could decide to approve quota trading arrangements but that without such a decision 
11 
and under the current legal framework, a member could not unilaterally decide to 
trade or lease its quota.  By contrast, Korea commented that national quota is the 
legal asset of the country and could be tradeable. 
73. Three alternate opinions were expressed on the issue of quota trading, these being: 
• That quota trading should be considered when the Management Procedure is 
implemented since at that stage, the TAC would be based on scientific 
information and a procedure should be in place for deciding national allocations 
of the TAC; 
• While the stock was considered to be in a serious state, unused quota should not 
be re-allocated through quota trading which would increase catch; and 
• That in principle quota trading was not desirable because a Member should not 
profit by trading its unused quota with another Member and because allocations 
are not conferred on a permanent basis. 
74. Members agreed to defer further discussion of quota trading until CCSBT 12. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Recording Intersessional Decisions 
75. The Executive Secretary presented the Secretariat’s paper (CCSBT-EC/0410/17) that 
proposed a method for recording intersessional decisions of the Commission. 
76. The Extended Commission agreed with the Secretariat’s proposal and noted that: 
• In principle, decisions of the Extended Commission should be taken at formal 
meetings; 
• In exceptional circumstances where decisions were required intersessionaly, the 
new system of recording decisions would apply; 
• Exceptional circumstances would need to be clearly defined; and 
• The record of the decision should indicate on what basis the decision was made. 
77. The Extended Commission noted that communication systems had evolved since the 
rules of procedure had been established for managing intersessional decisions.  It 
was agreed that a modification to the relevant parts of the rules of procedure to 
reflect these developments would be considered at CCSBT 12. 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Recreational Fishing 
78. Australia provided an update on its recreational SBT fishery.  Discussions are 
underway with the Game Fish Association of Australia (GFAA) for the GFAA to tag 
and release all the SBT that its members catch.  Tagging would be conducted with 
CCSBT tags and with the release data being provided to the CCSBT. 
79. Members considered this to be a worthwhile development, but since the location and 
quantity of tag releases is being conducted opportunistically rather than through a 
scientific plan, it was agreed that research mortality allowances would not be used 
12 
for this tagging.  Instead, any associated mortality would count against Australia’s 
catch allocation. 
80. In this context, New Zealand advised that it has assigned a 4 tonne SBT catch 
allocation for its recreational fishery out of its national allocation which it considers 
sufficient to cover its recreational catch. 
 
Agenda Item 16. 
Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
81. The Extended Commission adopted the report of the Fifth Meeting of the 
Ecologically Related Species Working Group (ERSWG).  It was agreed that the next 
meeting of the ERSWG should be held in early 2006 in Taiwan. 
82. Australia and New Zealand noted that issues related to improved data collection and 
provision, such as increased resolution and data for all species, had been raised at the 
ERSWG 5 and SC9 meetings and that they supported those comments. 
 
Agenda Item 17. 
Action Plan 
83. The Executive Secretary presented the paper CCSBT-EC/0410/20 on the Action 
Plan. 
84. Members noted that they had previously suspended taking action in accordance with 
the Action Plan adopted in 2000 against Indonesia on the basis that Indonesia 
advised that it wished to cooperate with the Extended Commission.  The Extended 
Commission was disappointed and concerned at Indonesia’s failure to become a 
Cooperating Non-Member of the Extended Commission. 
85. The meeting agreed that the Extended Commission would write to Indonesia within 
two months of the meeting to advise that the Extended Commission is considering 
taking stronger action against Indonesia in accordance with the Action Plan.  The 
letter would also indicate to Indonesia that it was still the Extended Commission’s 
wish that Indonesia become a Cooperating Non-Member as soon as possible. 
 
Agenda Item 18. 
Research Mortality Allowance 
86. In the 2003/2004 fishing season, 2.67 tonnes of RMA had been used for the Japanese 
spawning ground survey, and 14.68 tonnes of SRP mortality allowance had been 
used for tagging programs. 
87. One tonne of RMA was requested by Japan for an acoustic survey program in 
2004/05.  The Extended Commission approved this request. 
88. Fifty tonnes of SRP mortality allowance was requested for SBT tagging programs in 
2004/05, these being: 
• CCSBT surface fishery tagging (8t); 
13 
• Japanese longline pilot tagging in the western Indian Ocean (10t); 
• Australian longline tagging pilot in the Australian east coast fishery and eastern 
Indian Ocean (15t); 
• Australian global spatial dynamics tagging (AGSDT) program (12t); 
• New Zealand longline tagging in the western Pacific Ocean (5t). 
89. With the exception of the two Australian tagging projects, all SRP mortality 
allowance requests were approved.  For the two Australian projects, it was agreed 
that: 
• The total mortality allowance for the two Australian projects would not exceed 23 
tonnes; 
• Australia would provide further advice to the Extended Commission on the 
apportionment of mortality allowance between the projects once further analysis 
had been completed; 
• Australia would provide details of RMA utilized within its EEZ and on the high 
seas, including details of the tagging vessels utilized; and 
• Utilization of the Australian RMA on non-Australian flagged vessels would 
require agreement among Members intersessionally. 
90. It was agreed that in future detailed tagging proposals should be assessed and 
approved by the SC prior to the Extended Commission approving a RMA for the 
project.  It was also agreed that detailed project reports of current tagging work 
should be provided to the SC for assessment against research priorities. 
Agenda Item 19. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
91. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/0410/22 which outlined the 
interaction with other organisations during 2004 together with the proposals for 2005. 
92. The Extended Commission supported the proposals, but noted that participation at 
ACAP (Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels) was on the 
provision that this would only involve one day of participation and that the 
Executive Secretary fully explained the CCSBT’s work in relation to mitigating 
seabird bycatch. 
 
Agenda Item 20. 
Program of Work for 2005 
93. The program of work for 2005 was agreed and is at Attachment 13. 
 
Agenda Item 21. 
Confidentiality of Commission Documents 
94. The Extended Commission agreed that all documents produced for CCSBT 11 could 
be made publicly available. 
14 
 
Agenda Item 22. 
Other Business 
95. The Executive Secretary drew the attention of the Extended Commission to a 
possible anomaly in relation to Cooperating Non-Member status.  It seemed that 
under the wording of the resolution adopted by the Extended Commission, and 
approved by the Commission at CCSBT 10, that Cooperating Non-Members such as 
the Philippines were associated only with the Extended Commission and not the 
Commission. 
96. Members agreed that this was a matter that required assessment by national 
governments intersessionally for consideration at CCSBT 12 if necessary. 
 
Agenda Item 23. 
Close of Meeting 
23.1 Election of Chair and Vice-Chair for the Fourth Meeting of the Extended 
Commission 
97. The Extended Commission agreed that Japan should host and Chair the Twelfth 
Meeting of the Commission, and Australia will act as Vice-Chair.  The Fishing 
Entity of Taiwan would host and Chair the Extended Commission of CCSBT 12.  
Japan will be the Vice-Chair of this Extended Commission Meeting. 
98. It was agreed that the Extended Commission for CCSBT 12 will be held in Taipei on 
the tentative date of 11-14 October 2005. 
99. The Extended Commission also agreed that CCSBT 13 and its associated Extended 
Commission meeting should be hosted and chaired by Japan with Australia as Vice-
Chair. 
 
23.2 Adoption of report 
100. The report was adopted. 
 
23.3 Close of meeting 
101. The meeting closed at 6:00 pm, 22 October 2004

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Thank you Chairman. 
 
Let me begin by thanking Korea for hosting this Commission meeting here in the important port 
city of Busan.  I would also like to welcome Mr Barng as chairman of the eleventh annual meeting 
of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and Andrew Penny as the chair 
of the Scientific Committee. We also note that Dr Soh will be assisting the Chair and he has our full 
confidence.   
 
It is again pleasing that all the members of Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna are here today, as well as the Philippines as a co-operating non member.  South Africa is here 
as an observer and you are welcome.  This small commission has grown and is regarded by many as 
the best of the world’s fisheries commissions.   
 
But we have chair been delivered a real challenge by the Scientific committee and the external 
scientist.  The next 12 months will represent some of the most important work that we do together 
in this fishery.  The results from the stock assessment cannot be ignored and if we are to better 
understand this fishery so that we can make learned judgements on its future at CCSBT 12 then we 
need to be open and transparent with each other and readily share information and thoughts about 
the fishery.  
 
You know the frustrating thing about this is feeling that I have been here before. I left Christchurch 
last year with a genuine feeling that we were getting somewhere and all the problems of the 
previous 5 years had finally been resolved and we had a good basis for moving forward.  When I 
say it feels as though I have been here before though there are important differences and the most 
important of these is the working relationship between the parties and while we might argue and 
take strong county positions on issues there seems to be a common level of understanding about the 
challenges that we face with this stock. I can only hope that these relationships built between both 
government and industry leaders on al sides can get us through because I for one don’t want a return 
to past relationships. 
 
There area number of important issues for us at this meeting but they are all centred around the 
stock assessment and the TAC.  Last year the Commission as I have noted already reached 
agreement on a global TAC and national allocations for the first time in 5 years, I hope that 
members work to reach a similar consensus on this issue at this meeting.   
 
I will be asking members to make a commitment at this meeting to put in place a research and 
information gathering and analysis plan for the next 12 months to deliver for us information that 
will allow us to make conclusions on the stock assessment at the 2005 meeting.  Based on this 
additional information and the 2005 assessment against indicators, we will need to take 
management action including a reduction in the Global TAC in the 2005-06 fishing season, if the 
information we gather over the next 12 months does not disprove the declining stock/recruitment 
trends.   
 
It is imperative that the Commission has the most accurate data available to make a decision on 
TAC at CCSBT12.  We must all work together to collect this information as accurate data is in all 
of our best interests.  Members will need to share information on changes they see in the fishery this 
information will need to be used constructively if we are to move forward and I give you our 
commitment to do just that. 
 
If the CCSBT is to have a better understanding of the stock, we need to collect and share all 
possible data.  The data that Australia sees as vitally important is information on recruitment, the 
spawning stock and CPUE.   Of particular interest to us is a biomass estimate of the Great 
Australian Bight and getting international observers into all fleets even at low numbers to check on 
recruitment decline.   
 
Australia remains firmly committed to the development of the management procedure.  Agreeing to a 
new management objective is imperative to the management procedure process and therefore the 
future functioning of the Commission and deserves an appropriate amount of attention. 
 
It is important that the members of the Commission work to manage non-member catch, especially of 
Indonesia considering its impact on the spawning stock.  Australia would like to see a marine 
conservation area considered for the high seas area of the SBT Spawning Ground.  This would provide 
some refuge for the adult SBT.  I would also like to see members take the initiative at this meeting to 
make a strong statement to those countries outside of the Commission that engage in illegal, 
unreported and unregulated fishing to the detriment of Commission members who make sacrifices to 
manage the species sustainably.  
 
In closing it is important for all of us to remember the importance of this industry to not just our 
countries but to the towns and people who depend on the fish for a living.  For Australia this is an 
iconic industry and it is not one that I am going to give up but in saying that I am fully committed to 
co-operation through this commission to save both the fish and our industry.  At the end of the day the 
only hope this fish ahs for the future is a strong and functioning CCSBT. 
 
Can I also at this point congratulate Brian Macdonald for accepting a further 2 years at the CCSBT.  
He has made a major contribution to improvements in the functioning of the Secretariat and I for one 
am pleased that he has agreed to stay. I would also like to congratulate Narasawa-san for the 
constructive role he is playing in the CCSBT.  He is by far the most active and engaged Deputy 
Executive Secretary that we have had and he should be congratulated on his initiative. 
 At this meeting we also need to decide the future of the external scientific group and their ongoing 
engagement with the CCSBT.  They have been very influential also in improved relations and we must 
give this issue serious consideration.  My sense tells me to keep them but I am happy to discuss. 
   
I would like to thank the interpreters in anticipation of your efforts this week; this meeting would 
not function without your tireless efforts.  Finally I thank the Secretariat for all the hard work they 
have undertaken over the last year to bring us to what I expect will be a challenging but productive 
meeting. 
 
 
I look forward to the week.  Thank you. 
 
Attachment 4-2 
 
Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen 
 
First of all, on behalf of my delegation, I would like to extend my appreciation to the government of 
the Republic of Korea for providing such an excellent venue in holding this meeting. I would also 
like to extend my thanks to the Executive Secretary, Brian Macdonald and his staff for their 
excellent work in preparing the documents for the meeting. 
 
Mr. Chairman, it has been two years since our accession to the Extended Commission in 2002 as a 
member. Over the past two years, we have been working closely with other members with a view to 
achieving the objective of CCSBT in the conservation and management of SBT. We promise to 
continue doing so with other members and all those with interests in SBT to ensure sustainability of 
the stock for the need of the future generations. Since it will be the first time that meeting of the 
Extended Commission be held in Taiwan next year, I hope the Taiwan meeting can be comparable 
to the previous meetings if not better. One of the purposes of my heading this delegation to attend 
this annual meeting held in Busan, is to learn what attention we should pay to make the meeting in 
Taiwan flawless.  
 
I would like to extend my appreciation to all the scientists for their strenuous efforts in participating 
in the scientific work concerning SBT, particularly in developing a management procedure for the 
conservation of SBT. However, we are somewhat concerned about the lengthy process taken for 
developing the management procedure such that the Extended Commission has not been able to 
decide upon an applicable management strategy on the SBT stock. Further delay in finalizing the 
management procedure may jeopardize the future efforts in recovering the stock. We urge the 
technical working group to expedite the work, with completion of an updated and integrated 
operating model as soon as possible.   
 
In order to ensure conservation of SBT and management of SBT fishery, CCSBT should invite all 
those with real interests in SBT, including those coastal States through whose exclusive economic 
zone or fishery zone SBT migrates. However, in deciding catch limits for the new entrants, the 
Extended Commission shall take into account all relevant factors, in particular their historical catch 
of SBT, and the corresponding fishery they have developed. Catch limits shall only be given to 
those who have demonstrated their development of the fishery, rather than acquiring catch limits 
with the hope or aspiration of future possible development of the fishery. 
 
In closing, we look forward to working together with all members in the coming few days for 
achieving fruitful results. 
 
Thank you.      
Attachment 4-3 
 
Opening Statement by Japan 
(Translated by the Secretariat) 
 
First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to Korea and the people concerned for the 
arrangements made for this meeting. Also, I would like to express our appreciation to Executive 
Secretary, Mr. Brian Macdonald and his staff for their effort in preparing and circulating the various 
meeting documents and the logistics for the meeting. 
 
One year has already passed since CCSBT10 last year. We had a very constructive discussion last 
year and agreed on a TAC for the first time in seven years. We believe that we can maintain this 
constructive attitude at this meeting. 
 
The Scientific Committee, in September 2004, concluded that status of SBT stock is a matter of 
concern. Since the CCSBT was established, we have actively worked towards the conservation and 
management of SBT, and we have endured considerable TAC reductions to this end. Because of 
this, it was a great surprise to us to learn of the result of the stock assessment. 
 
We hope that we can have a clear explanation from this meeting regarding the reasons for the quick 
reduction of the stock. On the other hand, it is a fact that we have the responsibility as members to 
improve this condition. We are under pressure to urgently introduce various measures at this 
meeting. In Japan’s view, we need to address three issues : 
 
The first one is “what can we do more as members ourselves” and the second is “what are the more 
effective measures against non-members”. The last one is “what are the effective measures to 
protect the spawning ground”. 
 
Japan has a strong determination to positively address these issues as a developer of this stock and 
the biggest market country. 
 
Mr. Chairman, I would like to repeat again that I hope this meeting will finish successfully in four 
days time if we can repeat the constructive attitude shown by all members at last annual meeting. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Good morning and thank you to our hosts, Korea, for once again welcoming us so warmly 
to Pusan. 
 
As I said at the Special Commission meeting in April, New Zealand was greatly heartened 
by the outcomes of the meeting in New Zealand last year.  My delegation looks forward, 
under your leadership Mr Chairman, to a similar level of engagement, cooperation and 
agreement at this meeting. 
 
I would like to extend a special welcome to the Philippines as this Commission’s first 
cooperating non-member. An expanded membership of CCSBT that includes all those with 
an interest in this fishery can only benefit the long-term conservation and management of 
SBT.  My delegation looks forward to working with you this week.   
 
New Zealand sees significant challenges ahead for this Commission.  As members of the 
CCSBT and its Extended Commission we have a responsibility in our deliberations this 
week to live up to the core objective of the Convention under which this Commission was 
established 
 
 
… to ensure, through appropriate management, the conservation and optimum 
utilisation of southern bluefin tuna.” 
 
Balancing the competing objectives of conservation and use, as embodied in the 
Convention’s objective, is seldom easy.  In reaching management decisions, in particular 
the setting of a TAC and national allocations, many factors must be taken into account, in 
particular the advice from the Scientific Committee on the status of the stock.   
 
But there are other principles enshrined in the Convention, other parameters within which 
we must work.  In taking any management decisions we must ensure that we are not 
creating further inequities within this Commission. 
 
Mr Chairman, our Scientific Committee and our independent scientific panel have worked 
hard to bring us their best advice and their concerns about the status of the stock.  New 
Zealand shares these concerns and believes that the members of this Extended Commission 
must act within the constraints that such advice imposes on us.   
 
Indeed it has been the ongoing concern about the status of the SBT stock and the need to 
ensure that all fishing for SBT occurs within the ambit of CCSBT that has stopped New 
Zealand at previous meetings from pressing for the entitlement to an increase in our 
national allocation that was acknowledged by the Commission as far back as the Mutual 
Understanding reached at CCSBT1 in 1994. 
 
New Zealand has adhered to a 420 tonne allocation since national allocations were first 
agreed in 1994, even though in doing so we have severely constrained the ability of the 
New Zealand industry to develop the fishery in the New Zealand EEZ, or utilise the 
resources of that industry to build its catch more widely – at a time when others were 
engaged in just such expansion of their catch.  New Zealand has been a responsible 
member of this Commission.  The price of such restraint on our part has been a continuing 
inequity in New Zealand’s allocation.   
 
We therefore welcomed the decision of the Extended Commission at our meeting in 
Christchurch twelve months ago to acknowledge that there were outstanding issues that 
needed to be resolved.  In response to the Extended Commission’s invitation New Zealand 
has prepared a paper that addresses these issues, and suggests ways in which they might be 
resolved.  That paper has been distributed to all members and we look forward to engaging 
with you on the issues that it raises. 
 
At the Christchurch meeting the Extended Commission rightly identified that there were 
‘allocation principles’ reflected in the 1994 Mutual Understanding that needed to be 
accommodated in the current CCSBT environment.   The Commission did not call for a 
literal implementation of the CCSBT1 Understanding.  Nor is that what New Zealand is 
seeking in the paper we have distributed, or will be seeking in our discussions at this 
meeting. 
 
What we do argue, and what this Commission must address, is the outstanding claim that 
New Zealand has over the level of its allocation.  This allocation does not reflect our status 
as a coastal state, our past conservation efforts, and the available catch within our EEZ – all 
important allocation principles reflected in the CCSBT Convention itself and in 
international law. 
 
At CCSBT10 the Extended Commission undertook to resolve this issue, at the latest, in the 
context of agreement on the management procedure.  This remains New Zealand’s 
objective and our expectation of what the Commission will accomplish. 
 
In our discussion of this, and the many other important issues on our agenda this week, 
New Zealand will approach our deliberations with a clear acceptance of the responsibility 
we hold to take hard management decisions where these are needed.  We must all recognise 
that as Members of this Commission and as international managers of a resource under 
pressure, we have responsibilities that we cannot avoid or ignore, no matter how difficult 
the impact of this may be on the interests of those in the industries that we represent.   
Sometimes such responsibilities and obligations may make life difficult for regulators and 
officials in their dealings with industry.  Sometimes it may require action that may be 
difficult politically.  But it is on the way that we discharge those obligations at critical 
points that our success as a Commission and as individual members will be judged. 
 
Let me make it clear that New Zealand is willing to subject our management of the fishery, 
and the actions of vessels under our flag or under New Zealand control, to the scrutiny of 
our peers around this table.  We call on others to be similarly forthcoming. 
 
Mr Chairman, we have many other important issues on our agenda at this meeting.  We 
must continue to work hard at finding workable and effective solutions to the challenges we 
face.  We are particularly interested in hearing from the Chair of the Scientific Committee 
on progress with the Management Procedure process and more generally on the work of 
that Committee.   There has been extensive effort and commitment of resources put in to 
developing the MP - something which New Zealand has fully supported and will continue 
to support.  We do however need to bring this process to a satisfactory conclusion and 
reach agreement on a management procedure and related issues in 2005.   
 
Mr Chairman, these are just some of the challenges in a lengthy agenda ahead of us.  We 
are confident that you will lead us to repeat the successes of our Christchurch meeting in 
reaching agreement on TAC and national allocations, and in making substantive progress in 
other areas of our agenda.  My delegation and I look forward to working constructively, 
openly and in a spirit of cooperation with you, and with all delegates over the next few 
days. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the Republic of Korea 
 
Good Morning, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen! 
 
We, the Korean delegation, would like to extend a warm welcome to all the participants of the 
Extended Commission to Busan.  Also, I am very delighted to be here with you again in Busan in 
the midst of Korea’s beautiful autumn.  My special thanks goes to all the staff members of the 
Secretariat who have devoted themselves to organizing and preparing this meeting. 
 
Our concerted efforts focus on the conservation and rational use of SBT resources.  In this regard, I 
would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the scientists and experts as well as the 
Chairperson of the CCSBT Scientific Committee for the valuable role they have played in the field 
of stock assessment and the Management Procedure.  
 
However, despite the great endeavors of scientists and experts, it is really regrettable that the 
completion of the Management Procedure cannot be achievable in this meeting.  Nevertheless, in 
Korea we have a proverb that says that late fruit keeps well, so I hope that we will put together a 
dependable Procedure in the coming year.  
 
Korea would like to propose that the change of TAC be discussed after the completion of the 
Management Procedure.  Since an ad hoc change of TAC without any scientific basis is not 
appropriate, and it would be quite difficult to reach a consensus on this issue at this time.   In 
addition, we have a number of issues that we have to address, including quota trading, Non-member 
related issues and the Catch Monitoring System.  
 
Again, we should bear in mind that non-members represent a growing threat to undermine the 
conservation and management measures taken by the Commission.  We need to introduce stronger 
MCS and other trade measures, as our Action Plan stipulates, so that the non-members may abide 
by the Commission’s conservation and management measures. 
 
Before I finish, I would like to express my hearty congratulations to Mr. Brian Macdonald, the 
Executive Secretary, and Mr. Robert Kennedy, the Database Manager, for the extension of their 
contracts. 
 
I am looking forward to working closely with all the participants and engaging in constructive 
discussions. 
 
I hope that you will have a pleasant stay in Busan.  
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the Philippines 
 
The Philippines delegation is pleased to participate at this 11th Annual Meeting of the 
Commission on Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), this time as a 
Cooperating Non-Member Party. We assure the Commission of the Philippines’ 
commitment to comply with the conservation and management measures of the 
Commission, specifically those which are contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the 
Resolution to Establish the Status of Cooperating Non-member of the Extended 
Commission and the Extended Scientific Committee. Also, we expect the upgrade of 
the Philippines’ status from being a cooperating non-member to member of the 
Commission. 
 
The Philippines looks forward to a positive result of the discussion on total allowable 
catch and its allocation. As you are aware, our country has been allocated with a quota 
of 50 tonnes per year. In my statement during the 10th CCSBT meeting, I informed the 
Commission about the modest SBT fishing industry in our country. Last year, 
however, our newly established SBT fishing industry has demonstrated a robust 
capacity for growth as manifested by an increase of almost a hundred percent of its 
SBT catch. Accordingly, and to sustain our SBT fishing industry, we believe that the 
current quota for the Philippines should be increased. I hope to be given an 
opportunity to justify this application during the discussion of the subject. 
 
In relation to its projected development of SBT fishing industry and capability of the 
Philippines, and reluctant to cause further reduction of the stocks, the Philippines 
strongly endorses the quota trading that has recently been floated about. Quota trading 
would serve as a suitable equalizer as it enables the participating members and 
cooperating non-members to transfer part of their non-utilized share to other members 
and non-members, which have the capability to utilize the allocation.  
 
The Philippines delegation also looks forward to the discussion of other issues that we 
view as equally important. These include the admission of new members, funding 
formula, and the management procedures.  
 
One particular concern, which is not included in the current agenda, but which I hope 
would be considered for future discussion is the possibility of the Commission’s 
adoption of the usual considerations and concessions that are granted to the 
developing countries by various Regional Fisheries Management Organizations 
(RFMOs). I have made a request on this in the past CCSBT meeting, and I certainly 
hope that this will be discussed in future CCSBT meetings. 
 
Thank you, and good day!

Opening Statement by the Republic of South Africa 
 
CONTRACTING PARTIES AND COOPERATING NON-CONTRACTING 
PARTIES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
  
RE: SOUTH AFRICA’S COOPERATION WITH THE CCSBT AND 
POSSIBLE CATCHES OF SBT   
 
The DFA has the honour to present its compliments on behalf of South Africa. South 
Africa regrets to inform the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna (CCSBT) that the delegation of the Department of Environmental Affairs and 
Tourism, the DDG Horst Kleinschmidt will be unable to attend the 11th Commission 
meeting.  
 
South Africa has in the past stated its intention to develop a tuna longline sector to the 
Commission. This intention is currently being translated into action before the 
allocation of fifty longterm rights in the pelagic longline sector for the 2004/5 fishing 
season. Recognising that Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) are likely to be caught by this 
fishery, advance notice of South Africa’s intentions is hereby being given to the 
Commission. This request reiterates a similar notice of intent that was given to the 
Commission at the ninth Commission meeting in Canberra.  
 
Previous requests for a catch allocation from the Commission was denied, irrespective 
of the fact that SBT occurs within the South African EEZ, and up to 100mt annually 
of SBT has been successfully caught by foreign large scale longline vessels within our 
EEZ. Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine the quantum of SBT caught in 
close proximity to our EEZ, which could be targeted by South African vessels, as the 
historic reporting structure did not allow for it.  
 
South Africa furthermore wishes again to point out some of the conclusions of the 
FAO Expert Consultation on the Management of Shared Fish Stocks (Norway 2002):  
“On the basis of existing evidence, the Working Group concluded that zonal 
attachment and historical catches were the most applied criteria. Zonal 
attachment was considered especially important for that segment of the 
resource to be found within the EEZ or EEZs whereas historical catches were 
found to be particularly important for sharing that part of the resource in the 
adjacent high sea. When historic catches are used as an allocation criterion, it 
needs to be recognised that developing States may, for various reasons, not 
enjoy the benefit of a history of fishing. In such cases, due to cognisance 
should be given to the special status given to developing States by both the 
1982 UN Conventions on the Law of the Sea and the 1995 UN Fish Stocks 
Agreement. The supplementary criteria listed with reference to transboundary 
stocks are equally relevant to the case of straddling fish stocks”  
 
“A second issue concerning historical catches pertains to the historical 
catches within the EEZ. The question is whether the catches by the fleet or 
fleets of the coastal state alone are to count in determining the coastal state’s 
share of the resources or whether the catches of foreign vessels within the 
EEZ are to be included as well. The consensus is that all catches within the 
EEZ are to be counted, when establishing the historical catch record of the 
coastal state.”    
 
South Africa thus wishes to reiterate to the CCSBT that it has the firm intention to 
establish a tuna longline fishery and that this fishery will in all likelihood catch SBT, 
as it occurs in our EEZ. Furthermore, the participants in this fishery will not be 
restricted to the South African EEZ, thus will fish on the high seas as well. It is 
possible that catches in excess of 400mt of SBT may be landed by the South African 
longline fleet of 50 large scale longline vessels.  
 
South Africa therefore takes this opportunity to alert the Commission that it intends to 
catch SBT and that it may place a voluntary upper catch limit of 250 mt SBT in this 
fishery. South Africa remains committed to sustainable resource use and responsible 
fishing and will as a matter of priority report all SBT catches to the Commission, as 
required by the trade information procedures accepted by the Commission. Although 
it is not possible to place a  quantum on catches, since we have not received an 
allocation, all SBT catches will be reported. 
 
Given the preference of the CCSBT to use past catch history as a guideline to 
establishing a catch allocation, the Commission has placed South Africa in the 
untenable position of being forced to establish a catch history, which may in all 
likelihood contribute to the unsustainable depletion of the resources and acting 
contrary to the stock rebuilding efforts of the CCSBT.  
 
South Africa would therefore like to report the latest available catch statistics of 
Southern bluefin tuna by vessels registered to fish with South African permits:  
Year          Catch (kg) 
2002    
15 239 
2003     
7 321  
2004      
 
In conclusion, South Africa humbly requests the members of the Commission to take 
heed of the FAO Expert Consultation and to possibly review its position on past catch 
history as the sole allocation criteria. South Africa may be willing to declare a 
voluntary upper catch limit of 250 mt, bearing in mind that such upper limit should 
not hamper the establishment of a tuna longline fishery.   
 
South Africa has an outstanding reputation as a responsible fishing nation and offers 
to cooperate with the CCSBT not only on scientific programs and catch sampling and 
monitoring in its ports. South Africa wishes to inform the Commission that it intends 
to expand its cooperation with the CCSBT to become a co-operating non-contracting 
party and the notice to obtain Ministerial approval for this status has been drafted. 
 
South Africa is also at the forefront to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unregulated 
and unreported catch in the waters surrounding Southern Africa, as the recent 
intervention with the alleged illegal toothfish vessel “Pisces”, “Apache 1” and others, 
as well as the co-operation agreements with SADC countries to undertake joint 
inspection patrols. 
 
South Africa offers that it would be a worthy addition to the Commission and would 
like to participate in the CCSBT, to harvest the precious SBT resource on a 
sustainable basis. Should the Commission grant South Africa a provisional 250 mt 
catch allocation, we will endeavour to request our Minister to seek the Commission’s 
permission to become a contracting party to the CCSBT.   
 
Yours sincerely

Update of the Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery for the 2002-03 Season 
 
1. 
Introduction 
This report summarises catches and fishing activities in the 2002–03 quota year1 of the Australian 
southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii; SBT) fishery. It also provides a summary of the history of 
the Australian SBT fishery. Caton et al. (1995) provides a more detailed historical description of the 
fishery. The Australian Domestic SBT catch for the 2002-03 quota year (1 December 2002 to 30 
November 2003) was 5391 tonnes.  The 2002-03 figure is over the previously agreed Australian 
allocation of 5,265 tonnes because two operators exceeded their individual allocation over that 
season.  This has been dealt with by deducting the overcatch from the operators concerned at the 
start of the 2003-04 season.   
 
2. 
Operational Constraints on Catch 
Regulatory Measures 
Australia’s commercial SBT catch is managed under a Total Allowable Catch (TAC).  This TAC is 
made up of  individual transferable quotas (ITQs) granted as statutory Fishing Rights (SFRs) under 
the Southern Bluefin Tuna Management Plan 1995. 
 
Australia continued with restricted access arrangements to reduce the incidental catch of SBT in the 
domestic longline fishery.  Longline fishers that did not hold adequate quota to cover incidental 
catch of SBT in areas of high abundance were prohibited from fishing in such areas.  Those 
operators who were granted access were subject to a range of additional monitoring and compliance 
conditions including Vessel Monitoring Systems, and observer coverage.   
 
3. 
Catch and Effort 
In 2002–03, 99.7% of the Australian catch of SBT was taken by purse seine with the remainder 
taken by longline. Australian catch by gear and State for the quota years 1988-89 to 2002-03 is 
shown in Table 1. The Australian catch of SBT for the calendar years 2002 and 2003 is mapped in 
Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively. 
 
4. 
Historical Catch and Effort 
History 
Troll catches of SBT were reported as early as the 1920s off the east coast of Australia but 
significant commercial fishing for SBT commenced in the early 1950s with the establishment of a 
pole-and-live-bait fishery off New South Wales, South Australia and, later (1970), Western 
Australia. Purse seine gear overtook pole as the predominant method and catches peaked at 21 500 t 
in 1982. The bulk of this early Australian catch of SBT was canned. Following quota reductions in 
1983–84, the Western Australian pole fishery for very small juveniles closed down and the south-
eastern fishery began to target larger juveniles to supply the Japanese sashimi market. Surface 
catches were further reduced between 1989 and 1995 when about half of the Australian total 
                                                 
1 Various time periods, such as ‘calendar years’, ‘fishing seasons’ and ‘quota years’, can be used when describing Australia’s SBT 
fishery. Unless otherwise indicated, we have used quota years in this report, but note that fishing seasons of the various fishery 
components often span quota years. The start and end dates of Australian quota years have varied and are presented in Appendix 1. 
allowable catch (TAC) was taken by Australia–Japan joint venture longliners in the Australian 
Fishing Zone (AFZ). The joint venture ceased in late 1995. From 1992 to 1998, domestic longliners 
operating off Tasmania and New South Wales also took around 5-10% of the total Australian catch.  
In 1990–91 about 20 t of SBT tuna were transferred to fattening cages in Port Lincoln, South 
Australia, to enhance their value. These ‘farming’ operations increased from 3% of the Australian 
SBT TAC in 1991–92 to 98% in 1999–00 and has remained at or above that level since. 
Following declaration of the Australian Fishing Zone (AFZ) in 1979, Japanese longliners fished 
under a range of bilateral conditions, real time monitoring program and joint-venture arrangements 
until 1997 when Japanese longliners were excluded from all AFZ fishing operations following 
failure to reach agreement on global TAC within the CCSBT. Caton and Ward (1996) provide 
copies of annual subsidiary agreements for the operations of bilateral-licensed longliners in the AFZ 
from 1979–80 to 1994–95.  
Recent Seasons 
The Australian domestic SBT catches for the 2002 and 2003 calendar years were 4711 t and 5822 t, 
respectively. The 2003 calendar year catch is larger than the previously agreed national allocation to 
Australia of 5265 t because it represents the aggregation of catches from periods in two quota years. 
The 2001–02 quota year catch was 5262 t while the catch for the 2002–03 quota year was 5391 t. 
The 2002–03 figure is over the previously agreed national allocation to Australia because two quota 
holders caught over the allocation in that season. This has been dealt with by deducting the over 
catch from their 2003–04 allocation. 
 
5. 
Annual Fleet Size and Distribution 
In 2002–03, a total of 26 commercial fishing vessels landed SBT in Australian waters. 
South Australia 
The one- to five-year-old SBT, which school from late spring to autumn in surface waters of the 
eastern Great Australian Bight, South Australia, were fished by seven purse seiners during the 
2002–03 quota year, but various live bait, pontoon-towing and feeding vessels were also involved. 
Fishing commenced in early December 2002 and finished in late March 2003. 
Western Australia  
Four longliners caught SBT off the WA coastline in 2002–03. For confidentiality reasons all 
catches are incorporated in the NSW longline catch. Longline fishing in WA commenced in July 
2003 and finished in November 2003. 
New South Wales 
During 2002–03, 15 domestic longliners participated at some time in the area of the fishery for 
older juveniles and adults in deeper waters off NSW in winter. Longline fishing off NSW 
commenced in June 2003 and finished in October 2003. 
 
6. 
Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
Australians began fishing SBT in the early 1950s off New South Wales and South Australia and 
then later (1970) off Western Australia. Historically, the bulk of the Australian catch had been used 
for canning. Progressively over the mid to late 1980s, the Australian catch focused on supplying the 
Japanese sashimi market, with an increasing amount of the catch being transhipped to Japanese 
freezer vessels in the Great Australian Bight. 
The introduction of an ITQ based management plan in 1984 based on an Australian TAC of 14 500 
tonnes resulted in the redistribution of quota ownership.  In the late 1980s the Australian quota 
reductions to 5265 tonnes led to further restructuring.  From 1990 to 1994 approximately half the 
Australian quota was taken by Australian-Japan joint venture longliners.  With the termination of 
the joint venture arrangements in 1995 Australian catches again focused on the surface fishery with 
poling operations supplying the fresh chilled sashimi market and purse seiners providing SBT to 
farms. Since 1992 there has been a progressive increase in the number of SBT taken under farming 
operations.  In the 2002-03 season this component utilised over 99% of the Australian quota. 
 
7. 
Fisheries Monitoring 
There are a series of logbooks and associated catch records that are required by law to be completed 
by fishers and fish receivers and sent to AFMA for the purposes of monitoring, compliance and 
research.  Each logbook has been specifically designed for use in the various SBT catching sectors, 
that is pelagic longline, purse seine, and minor line/troll.  All of the data provided from Logbooks 
and Catch Disposal Records must be supplied to AFMA within specified time periods specific to 
each record.  Validation of this data is undertaken as a minimum on an annual basis through an 
audit process by AFMA compliance staff, and sometimes on a needs basis.  The monitoring 
arrangements in the SBT fishery continue to be reviewed and refined in order to improve 
monitoring and compliance. 
Catch Disposal Records 
Catch disposal records for SBT are for recording SBT taken by fishers for the purposes other than 
farming and are signed by the fishing concession holder and the first receiver immediately after 
unloading the catch.  Catch disposal records provide a means to verify logbook data. 
Australian Daily Fishing Log and Farm Transit Log 
In the SBT purse seine fishery for farms, the Master of the catcher vessel (with quota assigned) is 
required to complete the Australian Purse Seine and Pole Daily Fishing Log – for farmed SBT only.  
A specific permit called the Farm Transit Log is then completed by the holder of the SBT carrier 
boat permit or representative, and provided to the monitoring company which undertakes the fish 
count when fish are transferred from tow cages to farm cages. 
Farm Disposal Record 
A specific process has been designed to obtain data to allow for research, monitoring, and 
compliance of SBT fishing operations that support SBT farming operations.  An independent 
company is contracted annually by AFMA to conduct a 40 fish sample and subsequent video count 
of all SBT transferred from tow cages to grow out cages. This count of captured fish will be 
multiplied by the average fish weight derived from the 40 fish sample and is then deducted from 
operators quota holdings.  All mortalities that occur during the capture and towing operations must 
also be recorded on specific forms.  AFMA Compliance Officers have been regularly deployed on 
farm tow vessels to observe procedures and protocols as part of a risk based SBT compliance 
program.  
Observer Programmes  
Observer programmes for the purse seine and longline sectors were implemented in the 2002-2003 
fishing season and achieved greater than 10 percent coverage of catch and effort. A detailed 
overview of the 2004 SBT observer program is provided at Attachment 1 in Australia’s 2002-03 
Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishing Season report to the ninth meeting of Scientific Committee meeting. 
Seasonal Area Restrictions 
To minimise the risk of non-quota take of SBT by longliners off New South Wales and Western 
Australia, access to the waters through which SBT migrate has been restricted to vessels holding 
SBT quota since 2000 in NSW and 2001 in WA. 
 
8. 
Other Factors 
Import/Export Statistics 
The Trade Information Scheme (TIS) that records all exported Australian fish has been 
implemented and refined.  A TIS form is completed by an authorised signatory from the export-
registered establishment that is the last to handle the consignment before the product leaves 
Australia and validated by a Government officer.  The form is used for both farmed and non-farmed 
SBT.  This program provides a complete record of SBT exports that can be compared with the 
Japanese Import Statistics. 
Markets 
More than 95% of Australia’s SBT catch is exported to Japan.

Review of Taiwan’s SBT Fishery of 2003/2004  
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Taiwan has traditionally been fishing for southern bluefin tuna (SBT) 
since 1970s.  The SBT was caught partly by seasonal target fishery and 
partly by albacore/bigeye fisheries as a by-catch.  Seasonal target fishery 
was conducted mainly by longliners equipped with super cold freezers, fishing 
in two seasons, i.e. one from June to September and the other from October to 
February of the following year, in the waters around 30°S-35°S.  However, 
no year-round target fishing has yet been conducted.  The annual catch in 
2003 was preliminarily estimated to be 1,128 M.T. 
 
2. OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON EFFORT 
Regulatory Measures 
Taiwan has become a member of the Extended Commission of CCSBT in 
2002, and agreed to national catch limit of 1,140 M.T. Two groups of fishing 
vessels for seasonal target fishery and by-catch on SBT are differentiated and 
each of those authorized vessel is allocated with individual quota.  Each 
vessel is required to register with the Taiwan Tuna Association either for 
target or by-catch fishery, and those vessels have to be reviewed and approved 
by the government before catching SBT.  About 95% of the annual catch 
was allocated to the seasonal target fishery vessels, while the remaining 5% 
to the by-catch vessels in 2003.  
In order to collect SBT catch information in a timely way and to manage 
the total SBT catch not exceed the catch limit, every vessel that catches SBT 
has been required to weekly report it’s catches of SBT in weight and fishing 
location to the fisheries authorities since 1996.  This system has been refined 
in 2002 to obtain more accurate catch information including the length 
measurement of each fish caught.  Taiwan has undertaken issuing of SBT 
Statistical Document to export of SBT from June 2000 to comply with the 
requirement of Trade Information Scheme (TIS).  All vessels fishing for SBT 
have also been required to be equipped with Vessel Monitoring System 
(VMS) for transmitting the vessel location in near real time to the monitoring 
center since 2002.  Fishing in spawning area of SBT suggested by Scientific 
Committee is prohibited and document of TIS will not be issued to any catch 
from this area to protect the spawning stock.   
 
3. CATCH AND EFFORT 
In the 2003 fishing season, catch limit of 1,140 tons was set, and the 
actual catch was 1,128 tons caught by 101 vessels including seasonal target 
  
 
and by-catch fishery.  About 93% of the Taiwanese SBT catch was caught in 
the southern and central Indian Ocean, 7% was caught in the southern and 
western Indian Ocean extending to the eastern boundary of the Atlantic 
Ocean.  There are 134 vessels approved as seasonal target or by-catch 
fishery in 2004. 
  
4. HISTORICAL CATCH AND EFFORT 
In early 1980s, annual catch of SBT was relatively small as less than 250 
M.T.  With continuously expanding of tuna longliners fleet, fishing grounds, 
increase in annual catches was prominent afterwards.  Between 1989 and 
1992, there was significant increase of SBT annual catch exceeding 1,100 
M.T. of which drift net fishery accounted for about 1/4 of the catches.  With 
the prohibition of drift net fishery on the high seas since 1993 in compliance 
with United Nations Gillnet Moratorium, the annual catch of SBT decreased 
to a stable level fluctuating between 800 and 1,600 M.T. during the last 
decade (Table 1).  
 
5. ANNUAL FLEET SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION 
In 2003, 101 longline vessels were approved for catching SBT, of which, 92        
operated in the Indian Ocean, while the remaining 9 operated in the Atlantic Ocean. 
Their fishing grounds were mainly in the waters of 20°S - 40°S, seasonally 
distributed in the southern and central Indian Ocean from June to September, 
and in the southern and western Indian Ocean extending to the eastern 
boundary of the Atlantic Ocean from October to February of the following 
year.  
 
6. HISTORICAL FLEET SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION 
SBT was caught only by longline fishery after 1992 in the three oceans, but 
mainly in the Indian Ocean.  According to the weekly reports from the fishing 
vessels and trader’s information, about 140 Taiwanese deep sea longliners landed 
SBT each year during 1998-2002, and most of them operated in the Indian Ocean.  
 
7. FISHERIES MONITORING 
Intensive efforts have been continuously exerted for better understanding and 
monitoring the fishery through the following measures: 
1. The weekly report for SBT catch is required through the Taiwan Tuna Association 
to submit to the Fishery Agency. Provision of daily records, including catch, 
fishing location and discards in the weekly report has been required for applying 
SBT statistical document since 2002.   
2. From April 2002, it is mandatory for the vessels that catch SBT to be equipped 
with VMS in order to monitor location of the vessels.  
3. The experimental scientific observer program has been launched since 2003. 
  
 
4. TIS program has been implemented to collect more updated and detailed catch 
information. While applying for TIS document, the applicant is required to submit 
the transshipment document issued by the cargo carriers. After unloading catch in 
Japan, the applicant is required to submit to Fisheries Agency the unloading 
documents issued by the Japanese Customs for further verification of catch 
statistics. 
 
8. OTHER FACTORS 
Markets 
Currently, SBT caught by Taiwanese vessels is mainly exported to Japan for its 
sashimi market.  Due to lack of sufficient super cold storage and low domestic 
consumption, the domestic SBT market in Taiwan is still in a low level in the year of 
2003.

Review of Southern Bluefin Tuna Fisheries of Japan for the 2003 Fishing Season 
 
1.  Summary 
(1) The total amount of catch of SBT for the 2003 fishing season (1 March 2003 - 29 
February 2004) was 5,570 MT. 
(2) Japanese distant-water tuna longline fisheries industry has faced a severe business 
situation due to a fall in the price of tunas caused by a decline of demand for tunas 
because of the long-term recession of Japan and the continuing high-level import of 
tunas. 
 
2. Management of Catch and Effort for SBT 
(1) Government of Japan (GOJ) has been managing the catch of SBT for each fishing 
season based on TAC and national allocations agreed by CCSBT. 
(2) Fishing operations for the 2003 fishing season was set catch limit of 5,839MT, which 
was subtracted 226MT from a voluntary catch limit of 6,065MT because no agreement 
was reached for this season at CCSBT Commission. 
(3) Moreover, GOJ has conducted the time/area closure to protect spawning grounds and 
juveniles. 
(4) Every year the Japanese fishing industry has voluntary set starting days for three 
sub-fishing areas (high seas area off Tasmania/Sydney, off Cape Town and in Southern 
Indian Ocean), and limits the total number of vessels for each sub-fishing area. 
 
3. Catch and Effort for 2003 period (refer to Appendix 1) 
In the 2003 fishing season, the total amount of actual catch by Japanese fishing vessels 
was 5,770 MT by 221 vessels.  This amount is divided into three sub-regional areas:  
high seas off Tasmania/Sydney with the catch of 1,556 MT by 53 vessels, high seas off 
Cape Town with 2,884 MT by 105 vessels and high seas in the Southern Indian Ocean 
with the catch of 1,074 MT by 63 vessels, respectively.  The amount of by-catch was 
257 MT. 
 
4. Historical Catch and Effort (refer to Appendix 1) 
 (1) In the 1999 fishing season, GOJ set catch limit as 6,065 MT, which was same as for 
the 1998 fishing season in the absence of the decision on TAC by the Commission.  
However, following the prescription of provisional measures by International Tribunal 
for the Low of the Sea (ITLOS) concerning the experimental fishing conducted by 
Japan, the actual catch for the 1999 season was 5,354 MT. 
(2) In the 2000 fishing season, GOJ set the voluntary catch limit as 4,578MT, which was 
1,487MT less than that of the national allocation to Japan agreed in 1997. However, 
since the provisional measures prescribed by ITLOS was revoked in August 2000, the 
voluntary catch limit was changed to 6,065MT in September 2000. The actual catch in 
the 2000 season was 6,027MT. 
 
 
(3) In the 2001 fishing season, fishing operations were started with the original catch 
limit as 6,065MT and GOJ set revised catch limit as 6,421MT after consultations with 
the relevant Members. The actual catch in the 2001 season was 6,647MT. 
(4) In the 2002 fishing season, fishing operations were set as a voluntary catch limit of 
6,065MT, and the actual catch was 6,192MT. 
 
5. The Historical Number of Vessels and Distribution (refer to Appendix 1) 
(1) In the 1999 fishing season, the number of vessels for SBT was 227, which was 30 
vessels less than that of 1998 fishing seasons since Japan cut the number of 
distant-water tuna longline vessels following the Plan of Action agreed by FAO. 
(2) In the 2000 fishing season, the number of vessels for SBT was reduced to 172 in 
accordance with the reduction of the catch limit based on the provisional measures 
prescribed by ITLOS. However, since the provisional measures were revoked, 27 more 
vessels were added to the original, and consequently 199 vessels operated for SBT 
because of the increase of the catch limit in September. 
(3) In the 2001 and 2002 fishing season, the number of vessels for SBT was 227 and 224, 
respectively. 
 
6. Fisheries Monitoring 
(1) GOJ issued a notification to the industry that each vessel targeting SBT must report 
to GOJ every 10days for the management of the catch limit. 
(2) GOJ took necessary measures to control and monitor the fishery including dispatch 
of enforcement vessels to the fishing area and requirement for fishing vessels to install 
VMS on-board and to report a daily position to GOJ. 
(3) In the 2003 fishing season, 3 enforcement vessels were dispatched to the SBT fishing 
grounds. 
 
7. Others factors (refer to Appendix 2 for Japanese import of SBT) 
(1) From 1995 to 1998, the amount of SBT imported to Japan had significantly increased. 
From 1998 to 2002, the amount of SBT import had been stable at around just over 
10,000MT (product weight). 
(2) The amount of import of SBT in 2003 was 8,244MT (product weight), approximately 
2,000 MT less than that of 2002.  Of SBT exporting countries, the biggest 4 exporting 
country/entities (1: Australia, 2: Taiwan, 3: Republic of Korea, 4: New Zealand) 
accounts for 98.4% of the total amount. 
(3) In 2003, the amount of SBT import from Australia, the biggest exporting 
country/area of SBT to Japan, was 6,368 slightly decreased from 2002. This amount of 
SBT accounts for 77.2% of the total import of SBT to Japan.

*Notes：
  Imported SBT from China is originally captured by Japanese vessel and then processed at the factory in China which 
owned by Japanese company then reimported to Japan.The factory mentioned above was located in the Special Tariff 
area, therefore these imported tuna is treated specially on tax(reduction of taxes). For this reason Japan has not requested 
China to attach TIS documents.

Review of New Zealand SBT Fisheries 
 
1.  Introduction 
Since the start of the domestic southern bluefin tuna (SBT) fishery handline, trolling and 
longline have been used to target SBT in the EEZ. In recent years nearly all of the SBT 
catch has been by surface longline with small catches by trolling. The domestic fishery is 
composed of a wide range of vessel types including many small owner-operated boats, a 
few large low temperature longliners purchased overseas and 4–5 large low temperature 
Japanese operated distant water longliners chartered by a New Zealand company. Both 
the chartered vessels and the New Zealand owner-operated vessels fish competitively 
against New Zealand’s SBT catch allocation. 
 
New Zealand’s fishing year starts 1 October and finishes 30 September of the following 
year. SBT is seasonally present from March/April to July. Fishing takes place primarily in 
two areas, off the east coast of the North Island north of 42 S and off the west coast of the 
South Island south of 42 S. The distribution of SBT catches by month and latitude in 
2002/03 is shown in Figure 1. The 2002/03 SBT season was closed early when the 
reduced quota (388 t) was reached.  
 
In 2003/04 the New Zealand southern bluefin tuna season was closed 12 July 2004 
(midnight) in anticipation of realising the national catch limit. The final catch (as of 13 
September 2004) was 397.3 t.  
 
2.  Operational Constraints on Effort 
Voluntary measures 
Since 1994 the New Zealand fishing industry has implemented voluntary measures with 
respect to longline fishing that are detailed in a “Code of Practice”. Specific measures 
include gear specifications, environmental standards, operational practices and closed 
areas. The intent of the measures is to minimize: 
• bycatch (eg of seabirds and marine mammals); 
• catch of SBT smaller than 20 kg; 
• impacts on other domestic tuna fisheries, and 
• gear conflict among SBT longline vessels. 
Other measures that are used but not part of the “Code of Practice” include catch limits by 
area, changing areas when bird bycatch reaches a specific level, using multiple “tori” 
lines and longer lines than specified in regulations, night-setting, and the use of 
pneumatic “bird-scaring” cannons. 
 
Regulatory measures 
New Zealand continues to impose the previously agreed national catch limit of 420 t 
(whole weight). This catch limit has been a competitive limit among all license holders. 
Regulations specified the annual catch limit and made it an offence to take SBT once the 
catch limit had been reached. The catch limit applied within and outside New Zealand 
fisheries waters for the “fishing year” which extends from 1 October to 30 September. In 
the few years when the catch limit had been exceeded, it was reduced in the following 
year by an equivalent amount. 
 
 
Until midway through the 2000/01 fishing season the SBT quota has applied to the catch 
of both southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) and Pacific bluefin tunas (formerly 
Thunnus thynnus, now recognized as Thunnus orientalis). The quota restriction on Pacific 
bluefin tuna was removed late in the 2000/01 SBT season when it was demonstrated that 
Pacific bluefin could be readily distinguished from SBT in catches based on 
morphological characteristics and DNA analysis. SBT landings reported prior to June 
2001 distinguished between northern and southern bluefin despite the fact the catches of 
both were counted against the SBT quota. Catches reported as northern bluefin were most 
likely Pacific bluefin. The quota restriction on northern bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) 
was removed in 2002. 
 
Southern bluefin tuna was introduced into the Quota Management System (QMS) 
effective 1 October 2004. The combination of small national allocation and large number 
of longline vessels operating in the EEZ had resulted in the traditional New Zealand SBT 
fishery becoming an “Olympic” fishery. The entry of SBT into the QMS provides a 
framework where recognised SBT quota holders can maximise the economic efficiency of 
their longline operations. New Zealand’s allocation applies to all fishing and fishing 
related mortality caused by New Zealand nationals and for the 2004/05 fishing year has 
been allocated as follows: 
 
Tonnes 
(whole weight) 
Recreational take 
4 
Customary take 
1 
Other fisheries related sources of mortality 
2 
Total allowable commercial catch 
413 
Total 
420 
 
NZ anticipates a number of improvements in the management of its southern bluefin tuna 
fishery as a result of a move to QMS management.  There are a number of flexible 
provisions within that system which if fully implemented will see NZ catch continue to 
vary from year to year. The ability to balance any over catch from one year to the next 
will also be affected however NZ will ensure that on average the catch from the fishery 
does not exceed the national allocation. 
 
Pacific bluefin tuna were also introduced into the QMS on 1 October 2004 with a total 
allowable commercial catch of 116 t. 
 
3.  Historical Catch and Effort 
Table 1 gives the estimated SBT catch by gear type since 1999 and clearly shows that the 
New Zealand SBT fishery has essentially become a longline fishery. With the advent of 
domestic longline fishing (starting in 1990) longline effort has almost completely 
replaced fishing effort by trolling and handline. However, small amounts of SBT continue 
to be caught by trolling and handline and together with a small SBT bycatch in the mid-
water trawl fishery (1.1 to 2.5 t per year) comprises the SBT fishery in New Zealand 
waters. Total SBT catches are summarised by calendar year and fishing year (1 October 
to 30 September) in Table 2.  
 
The charter fleet primarily operates off the west coast of the South Island while the 
domestic owned and operated vessels primarily operate off the east coast of the North 
Island. The fishing season for SBT is essentially the same for both areas and begins in 
 
March/April and finishes when the quota is reached usually in June/July. Figure 2 shows 
the effort trend (in thousands of hooks) for the longline fishery from 1999 to 2003 for the 
two primary fishing areas for SBT for both SBT target and all tuna target sets. This figure 
also shows the nominal CPUE (number per 1000 hooks) for each area and also for 
longline sets that target SBT compared to those where it is a bycatch. It is clear from this 
figure that longline effort in the northeast area (mostly domestic owned and operated 
vessels) has dramatically increased since 1999, continuing a trend begun in the early 
1990s, while the fishing effort in the southwest area by the charter fleet has been 
relatively constant. It is also clear from this figure that while total effort (charter and 
domestic combined) targeting SBT has increased during this period, CPUE has declined 
in the core fishing areas and months by about 50%. 
 
4.  Annual Fleet Size and Distribution 
Longline fishing targeting SBT longline primarily occurs off the west coast of the South 
Island south of 42º S and along the east coast of the North Island north of 42º S. SBT also 
comprises a significant bycatch in the bigeye target fishery in the Bay of Plenty. Figure 3 
shows the position of all longline sets targeting SBT in 2002/03 (charter and owner-
operator vessels combined). 
 
The total number of longliners fishing in 2003 was 132 vessels, 58% of which were small 
longliners (< 50 GRT). This represents a 15% reduction in number of longliners fishing in 
2003 relative to 2002, due to a decrease in longliners < 50 GRT. The changes in vessel 
size composition since 1990 are shown in Figure 4. 
 
5.  Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
The New Zealand SBT fishery began off the west coast of the South Island as a winter 
small boat handline and troll fishery in the early 1980s. Since 1990, however, these 
methods have comprised only a minor component of the fishery. During the 1980s to 
mid-1990s most longlining was conducted by foreign licensed longliners from Japan. 
However, declining catch rates, shortened seasons of availability and reports of increased 
operating costs in the EEZ resulted in the foreign licensed fleet ceasing operations in 
1995. Domestic longlining began in 1991 and steadily increased up to  a maximum 
number of vessels in 2002 before declining again in 2003.  
 
6. Fisheries Monitoring 
Observer coverage 
Observer coverage has been nearly 100% in the charter fleet for several years. However, 
the small size of domestic owned and operated vessels and short trips has made it difficult 
for the Ministry of Fisheries (MFish) to realise the 10% target for observer coverage in 
this fleet. As a consequence, observer coverage in this fleet has typically been low. 
Observer deployments during the 2002/03 fishing year resulted in 15% of all longline 
operations targeting SBT being covered (77% of sets in the Charter fleet and 4% of sets 
on domestic owner-operator vessels). This level of observer coverage resulted in 39% of 
the New Zealand catch (in number) being observed. Realignment of MFish observer 
allocation should result in continued improvements in coverage of domestic owned and 
operated longline vessels. Observer coverage on vessels using handline or trolling was 
not done because the contribution of these methods to the total catch is negligible.  
 
RTMP coverage 
To date MFish has operated an in-season catch monitoring system for SBT. This system 
required that on-shore processing companies and freezer vessels (including all of the 
chartered fleet) report their catch by e-mail or fax during the season to MFish. Weekly 
reporting was required once 25% of the catch allocation was reached and daily reporting 
required when 50% of the catch allocation had been reached. Reports were collated and 
analysed by MFish with the season being closed as close as possible to reaching our 
national allocation. All SBT permit holders were then notified that the season was closed 
and that it would be an offence to take southern bluefin tuna for the remainder of the 
fishing year.  
 
From 1 October 2004 the catch monitoring and catch balancing systems in place for all 
other NZ quota species will apply to southern bluefin tuna.  All fishers are required to 
furnish monthly returns of catch and these are then matched to individual holdings of 
quota entitlement.  Financial penalties will apply to fishers (on a monthly basis) who 
catch southern bluefin tuna other than under the authority of quota.  Fishers have the 
opportunity to reconcile their catch and quota entitlements up until the end of the fishing 
year and if they do not do so the financial penalties increase.  The total fishery catches 
will be assessed annually and any adjustment made to future years to balance the catch 
from the fishery and the NZ national allocation as required. 
 
Biological information 
Observers from the MFish Scientific Observer Programme are responsible for collecting 
biological data on SBT and bycatch data for catch characterisation. In 2002/03, otoliths 
were collected from 845 SBT and observers recovered 5 tags (4 CSIRO tags and 1 
Japanese tag). Otoliths are stored at NIWA and a proposal for reading SBT otoliths is 
being prepared; tag recovery data were provided to the tagging agency. Length, weight 
(both processed and whole weights) and sex are recorded regularly for SBT and all major 
fish bycatch species. In total stomach contents were collected from over 1521 SBT and 
1647 SBT were measured in 2002/03. 
 
7. Other Factors 
Import/export statistics 
Statistics on the export of SBT are compiled by Customs and summarized by the 
Department of Statistics. Export statistics are further summarized by the New Zealand 
Seafood Industry Council and maintained as a database for economic evaluations of New 
Zealand fisheries. 
Markets 
The only market for SBT caught in the EEZ is the Japanese sashimi market and domestic 
consumption is negligible. 
Mitigation 
New Zealand regulations specify that all tuna longline vessels shall use seabird-scaring 
devices (“tori-lines”). The minimum standard for “tori lines” is the same as initially 
specified by CCAMLR. The domestic fishing industry has a voluntary code of practice 
advocating night setting for all tuna longlining and for the large tuna longline vessels a 
limit on total incidental mortality of “at risk” seabirds has been set. New Zealand is 
currently implementing an approved National Plan of Action for Seabirds in response to 
the FAO International Plan of Action for Seabirds. 
 
Recreational and Customary Catches of SBT 
Recreational fishing for SBT in New Zealand waters is limited. There are records of 
recreational catch from both the North and South Islands. There are no estimates of SBT 
catches by Maori non-commercial fishing. However, a nominal allowance is made that is 
expected to be sufficient to cover both recreational and customary catches within New 
Zealand’s national allocation.

Korean SBT longline fishery 
 
Dae-Yeon Moon, Jeong-Rack Koh, and Doo-Hae An 
National Fisheries Research and Development Institute 
Republic of Korea 
 
Introduction 
 
    Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) fishery is the most recently developed tuna fishery by 
Korean distant-water fishing industry since the early 1990s. The SBT catch made by Korean 
fleet reached a maximum in 1998, followed by continuous decrease until recent years. This 
was mainly due to the voluntary regulation of fleet size by Korean fishing companies to 
implement the resolution adopted by CCSBT before Korea joined CCSBT. The voluntary 
regulation of the fleet size at 16 vessels is effective until now, but the shift of these vessels 
from the Indian to the Pacific Ocean aiming to higher profit from fishery also contributed to 
the further decrease in catch of this species. 
 
Catch and Effort 
 
Fishing season of Korean SBT longline fishery usually starts in March and ends by 
November or December. Thus, fisheries statistics are collected and reported for a calendar 
year. In the first half of fishing season from March to July or August, usually Korean 
longliners are fishing on the high seas of the western Indian Ocean off South Africa, with 
occasional expanded operation to the southeastern Atlantic, while in the second half they 
move to the eastern Indian Ocean off the western Australia. This fishing pattern and fishing 
grounds have rarely been changed for the past 10 years of fishing history for SBT except for 
1991, but in 2002 some catches were also taken from the western fishing grounds until 
October.  
In 2002, 10 out of 16 registered longliners fished for SBT and made a catch of 649 mt 
(reported as processed weight) of SBT in the usual fishing area, showing a decrease by about 
18% from 2001 figure. This may be due to the decrease in fishing efforts (i.e. months) of 
some longliners. Longline catches in the SBT fishing grounds consisted of about 90% of SBT 
and 10% of non-target species including yellowfin, bigeye, albacore, swordfish and others. 
 
Nominal CPUE 
 
Catch per unit effort of Korean longline fishery for SBT has shown a decreasing trend 
from a peak at 8.4 fish/1,000 hooks in 1994. However, CPUE appeared to be more or less 
stable between 2.3 and 4.1 fish/1,000 hooks in recent years. CPUE in 2002 increased 
compared with that of 2001. It was noted from the monthly CPUE analyses that catch 
efficiency is higher from the western fishing ground, 2.7-5.6 fish/1,000 hooks than the 
eastern ground, 1.8-2.8 fish/1,000 hooks.  
 
Size composition 
 
Fishermen on board have routinely collected size of SBT but the data should be used 
with caution due to relatively small sample size and no validation procedure. Size of SBT 
caught by Korean longliners during the past 5 years ranges from 100 to 210cm FL with the 
average of 153cm and shows that SBT caught in the eastern area (162.3cm) were bigger than 
those in the western area (152.4cm). 
 
Fleet size and distribution 
 
Korean SBT fishery commenced in 1991 with a few longliners shifted from tropical 
waters where they targeted bigeye and yellowfin. Thus, in the early years of this fishery, SBT 
did not attract Korean fishing industry, but because of higher market price number of 
longliners rapidly increased to reach a maximum fleet size of 19 longliners in 1998. However, 
by the voluntary regulation of fleet size among fishing industries, annual fleet size for SBT 
fishery never exceeded 16 registered number since then which resulted in less catch than 
allocated quota of 1,140 mt in 2001 and 2002. Annual number of fishing vessels for SBT 
largely depends on Japanese market price and fishing condition on the fishing grounds. 
  
Other relevant information 
 
Observer program 
The Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (MOMAF) initiated fisheries observer 
program in 2002 to monitor Korean distant-water fisheries including those for tunas and to 
meet the requirements of regional fisheries bodies. At the initial stage, the size of observer 
program will be fairly small to cover only for the fisheries to be urgently implemented such 
as SBT longline fishery in CCSBT Convention Area but will be gradually developed to a 
bigger scale to cover all required areas of fisheries.  
The goal of the first stage of observer program development from 2002 to 2006 is to 
establish a domestic training system to educate national observers. In 2002, a total of 5 
observer candidates received a trainship from Hawaii longline observer program provided by 
Pacific Island Area Office (PIAO), NOAA. Among those 5 trainees, two joined 2-months 
research survey on-board RV of NFRDI in 2003, as part of  the on-board training practices 
that will be continued in 2004.

Report of the Philippines 
 
This being the first time that the Philippines, as a new Cooperating Non Member, will 
submit its National Report to CCSBT, this Report will contain a short description of the 
tuna fisheries of the Philippines.  
 
Description of the Philippine Tuna Fisheries 
 
Philippine waters have been a major tuna producer in the Western and Central Pacific 
Ocean since the early 1970’s with the successful development of purse seine fishing in 
conjunction with the use of payaos (anchored fish aggregating devices). In recent years, 
over 200,000 mt of tuna or about 10% of the WCPO tuna catch has been attributed to the 
domestic fisheries of the Philippines.  
 
Most of the tuna catch is taken by purse seine, ring net and handline gears with a variety 
of other artisanal gears also in use, such as gill net, troll, multiple handline and mini-
longline.  
 
The tuna fisheries is usually divided into two sectors, the municipal sector, involving 
vessels less than 3 GRT and the commercial sector, with vessels above 3 GRT and are 
prohibited from fishing in municipal waters less than 15 kilometers from the shoreline. 
The commercial sector provides the majority of the catch of oceanic tunas (146,000 mt in 
2002, or 70 % of the official tuna catch). This is primarily taken by larger purse vessels 
targeting skipjack and yellowfin, whereas the municipal sector catch, with handline as the 
predominant gear, takes similar quantities of oceanic and neritic tunas. Much of the 
municipal catch is utilized as fresh fish for local consumption whereas most of the 
municipal catch of skipjack and small yellowfin is for the canneries for processing and 
export. The larger yellowfin and bigeye tunas taken by handline are exported to sashimi 
market. The handline vessels range widely in their operations, in some cases beyond 
Philippine waters. 
 
Since the mid 1980s, larger purse seine vessels operated by Philippine companies have 
fished in neighboring countries under access, joint venture agreements or as local 
companies, with most of their catch being landed in Philippine ports for processing. 
Catches are also taken in high seas areas by purse seine and longline vessels. In view of 
the passage of the Philippine Fisheries Code in 1998 providing for incentives for 
Philippine fishing vessels operators to fish further in the Philippine EEZ and beyond have 
encouraged them to venture in other oceans like the Atlantic and Indian Oceans to catch 
tunas like yellowfin, big-eye and some incidental catch of southern bluefin tuna. So that 
in 1998, a number fishing companies taking advantage of the incentives provided under 
the Fisheries Code acquired several longline fishing vessels through outright purchase or 
through bareboat charter. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the implementation of the relevant CCSBT conservation and management measures, 
Philippine flagged fishing vessels are required under the Fisheries Code that before they 
can operate outside Philippine waters they should first secure an International Fishing 
Permit and Certificate from the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources 
(BFAR). They are also required to keep a daily record of fish catch and spoilage, landing 
points, and quantity and value of fish caught, and off-loaded for transshipment, sale 
and/or other disposal. The detailed areport should be submitted to the BFAR for 
validation. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the non-renewal of their 
Commercial Fishing Vessel and Gear License (CFVGL) and International Fishing Permit.  
 
The Fisheries Code also provide the establishment of a monitoring, control and 
surveillance system to ensure that the fisheries and aquatic resources in Philippine waters 
and adjacent waters are judiciously and wisely utilized and managed on a sustainable 
basis. The BFAR is now negotiating with some foreign companies that deal with vessel 
monitoring system (VMS) but due to the prohibitive cost and coupled with the country’s 
dire financial straits this might not come soon. 
 
Fisheries Information of Philippine vessels  
 
In 2003, the Philippines have 24 Philippine flagged longline vessels that are authorized to 
fish in the CCSBT Convention Area (list of vessels have already been provided to 
CCSBT). Table I shows a summary of by-catch of SBT by Philippine longline vessels 
from 1998 to 2003 and up to September 2004. It will be noted that in 2003 a total of 
about 85 mt SBT by-catch was taken by Philippine vessels.  
 
This year up to September 2004 Philippine flagged vessels only catch about 13 mt of 
SBT as by-catch. Report of by-catch for the rest the year will submitted to CCSBT after 
the end of the fishing season in December. 
 
Research and Statistics 
 
The Bureau of Agricultural Statistics of the Department of Agriculture is the agency 
mandated to collect/gather official fisheries statistics, among others. However, the 
Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources is the government agency collecting and 
collating data in so far as those reported by fishing vessels operating in the Atlantic, 
Indian and Pacific Oceans are concerned. The data gathered are reported to concerned 
Regional fisheries management bodies annually.. 
 
Tuna Statistical Document Program 
 
The Philippines have implementing CCSBT  SBT Statistical Document Program  for all 
catches exported by Philippine fishing companies to Japan as required by CCSBT 
management measures.  
 
As a new Cooperating Non-member of CCSBT the Philippines will strive to comply with 
all the conservation and management measures adopted by the Commission. Rest assured, 
therefore, of its commitment towards the sustainability of the tuna resources wherever 
they are found, the Philippines being also a member of the International Commission for 
the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) 
and now in the process of ratifying the Convention for the Conservation and Management 
the Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC).

New Zealand Proposal for Decision Rules concerning Allocation of TAC  
 
On the introduction of the management procedure the Extended Commission shall 
apply, and shall continue to apply, the following rules to determine the national 
allocations for members and for cooperating non-members whose allocations are less 
than 500 tonnes:  
• If the TAC is within a range of 10,000 tonnes and 15,000 tonnes the 
allocations will not be reduced.  
• If the TAC is below 10,000 tonnes, the allocations will be reduced in the same 
ratio as that applied to other members for that part of the reduction which is 
below 10,000 tonnes, or according to any other decision the Commission 
takes. 
 
If the TAC is set at a level above 15,000 tonnes the CCSBT 1 Mutual Understanding 
will be used as a basis for the determination of allocation. 
 
If the management procedure is not adopted at CCSBT 12 the Extended Commission 
will apply the above rules in its decisions on national allocations. 
  
Attachment 12 
 
Resolution on amendment of the Resolution on “Illegal, Unregulated and 
Unreported Fishing (IUU) and Establishment of a CCSBT Record of Vessels over 
24 meters Authorized to Fish for Southern Bluefin Tuna” adopted at the 
CCSBT10 in 2003 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Noting that the Resolution on “Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported Fishing (IUU) and 
Establishment of a CCSBT Record of Vessels over 24 meters Authorized to Fish for 
Southern Bluefin Tuna (hereinafter referred to as “the original Resolution”) ” was 
adopted at its 10th annual meeting in 2003; 
 
Further Noting that substantial amount of Southern Bluefin Tuna has been and are 
harvested by vessels less than 24 meters operating under flags of non-members to the 
CCSBT which are not covered by the original Resolution; 
 
Considering the urgent need to take further comprehensive approach to deter IUU 
fishing activities; and 
 
Recognizing technical difficulties for import states to establish effective inspection 
schemes on import of fresh tuna products. 
 
Agrees, in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8 of the CCSBT Convention, that:  
 
The provision regarding vessel size limitation in the original Resolution which applies 
to those more than 24 meters is removed, and the original Resolution is amended as 
follows: 
 
1. The Contracting Parties, Member of the Extended Commission and Cooperating 
Non-Members shall: 
a. ensure that all vessels under their registry do not carry out IUU fishing activities 
for southern bluefin tuna; 
b. take every possible action, consistent with relevant law, to prevent, deter and 
eliminate IUU fishing; and 
  
c. review progress on the issue of IUU fishing for SBT and the implementation of it’s 
IUU measures including adopting further measures as required on a regular basis.  
 
2. The Extended Commission shall establish and maintain an CCSBT Record of 
fishing vessels(hereinafter referred to as "fishing vessels" or "FVs") authorized to fish 
for SBT.  For the purpose of this recommendation, FVs not entered into the Record 
are deemed not to be authorized to fish for, retain on board, tranship or land SBT. 
 
3. Each Member of the Extended Commission (hereinafter referred to as “Member”), 
and Co-operating Non-member shall submit electronically, where possible, to the 
Executive Secretary by 1 July 2005, the list of FVs flying its flag that are authorized to 
fish for SBT.  This list shall include the following information:  
      - Name of vessel(s), register number(s);  
      - Previous name(s) (if any);  
      - Previous flag(s) (if any);  
      - Previous details of deletion from other registries (if any);  
      - International radio call sign(s) (if any);  
      - Type of vessel(s), length and gross registered tonnage (GRT);  
      - Name and address of owner(s) and operator(s);  
      - Gear(s) used; and 
      - Time period authorized for fishing and /or transhipping. 
  
The Members and Co-operating Non-members shall indicate, when initially submitting 
their list of vessels according to this paragraph, which vessels are newly added or 
meant to replace vessels currently on their list submitted to the Executive Secretary.  
The initial CCSBT record shall consist of all the lists submitted under this paragraph. 
 
4. Each Member and Co-operating Non-member shall promptly notify, after the 
establishment of the initial CCSBT Record, the Executive Secretary of any addition to, 
any deletion from and/or any modification of the CCSBT Record at any time such 
changes occur. 
 
5. The Executive Secretary shall maintain the CCSBT Record, and take any measure to 
ensure publicity of the Record and through electronic means, including placing it on 
the CCSBT website, in a manner consistent with confidentiality requirements noted by 
the Members and Co-operating Non-members. 
  
 
6. The flag Members and Co-operating Non-members of the vessels on the record 
shall: 
a) authorize their FVs to fish for SBT only if they are able to fulfill in respect of 
these vessels the requirements and responsibilities under the CCSBT Convention 
and its conservation and management measures; 
b) take necessary measures to ensure that their FVs comply with all the relevant 
CCSBT conservation and management measures; 
c) take necessary measures to ensure that their FVs on the CCSBT Record keep on 
board valid certificates of vessel registration and valid authorization to fish and/or 
tranship; 
d) affirm that if those vessels have record of IUU fishing activities, the owners have 
provided sufficient evidence demonstrating that they will not conduct such 
activities any more;  
e) ensure, to the extent possible under domestic law, that the owners and operators of 
their FVs on the CCSBT Record are not engaged in or associated with fishing 
activities for SBT conducted by FVs not entered into the CCSBT Record; 
f) take necessary measures to ensure, to the extent possible under domestic law, that 
the owners of the FVs on the CCSBT Record are citizens or legal entities within 
the flag Members and Co-operating Non-members so that any control or punitive 
actions can be effectively taken against them. 
 
7. The Members and Co-operating Non-members shall review their own internal 
actions and measures taken pursuant to paragraph 5, including punitive and sanction 
actions and in a manner consistent with domestic law as regards disclosure, report the 
results of the review to the Extended Commission at its 2005 meeting and annually 
thereafter. In consideration of the results of such review, the Extended Commission 
shall, if appropriate, request the flag Members and Co-operating Non-members of FVs 
on the CCSBT Record to take further action to enhance compliance by those vessels to 
CCSBT conservation and management measures. 
 
8. a) The Members and Co-operating Non-members shall take measures, under their 
applicable legislation, to prohibit the fishing for, the retaining on board, the 
transhipment and landing of SBT by the FVs which are not entered into the 
CCSBT Record. 
b) To ensure the effectiveness of the CCSBT conservation and management 
  
measures pertaining to SBT Statistical Document Programs: 
i) flag Members and Co-operating Non-members shall validate statistical 
documents only for the FVs on the CCSBT Record, 
ii) the Members and Co-operating Non-members shall require that SBT caught 
by FVs, when imported into the territory of a Member be accompanied by 
statistical documents validated for the vessels on the CCSBT Record and, 
iii) the Members and Co-operating Non-members importing SBT and the flag 
States of vessels shall co-operate to ensure that statistical documents are not 
forged or do not contain misinformation. 
 
9. Each Member and Co-operating Non-member shall notify the Executive Secretary 
of any factual information showing that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting 
FVs not on the CCSBT record to be engaged in fishing for and/or transhipment of 
SBT.   
 
10 a) If a vessel mentioned in paragraph 8 is flying the flag of a Member and 
Co-operating Non-member, the Executive Secretary shall request that Member 
and Co-operating Non-member to take measures necessary to prevent the vessel 
from fishing for SBT.  
b) If the flag of a vessel mentioned in paragraph 8 cannot be determined or is of a 
non-Member without cooperating status, the Executive Secretary shall compile 
such information for future consideration by the Extended Commission.  
 
11 The Extended Commission and the Members and Co-operating Non-members 
concerned shall communicate with each other, and make the best effort with FAO and 
other relevant regional fishery management bodies to develop and implement 
appropriate measures, where feasible, including the establishment of records of a 
similar nature in a timely manner so as to avoid adverse effects upon other tuna 
resources in other oceans.  Such adverse effects might consist of excessive fishing 
pressure resulting from a shift of the IUU FVs from fishing for SBT to other fisheries.  
  
12 Before the Extended Commission decides to implement measures specified in 
paragraph 8, the Extended Commission and the Members shall contact all the relevant 
countries to inform of this resolution and consult with them, and give them sufficient 
time to adopt themselves to this resolution.  They shall continue to encourage 
non-Contracting Parties to become Members or Co-operating non-Members.
