Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
9. 
The report from the Secretariat was provided to the meeting as paper CCSBT-
EC/1910/04.  The meeting noted the activities of the Secretariat as reported. 
10. The EC agreed to the Secretariat’s proposed changes to the Chairing 
arrangements for CCSBT subsidiary bodies, to reflect the existence of the 
Technical Compliance Working Group that was created at CCSBT 25. The 
revised Chairing arrangements are at Attachment 6. 
 
11. The EC accepted an offer from Mr Robert Kennedy to continue as Executive 
Secretary for another term, which would finish in October 2023. Mr Kennedy 
committed to providing substantial notification to the EC, to allow recruitment of 
a replacement Executive Secretary, if he was not able to continue for the full 
term. 
12. The EC deferred consideration of whether to modernise the CCSBT’s formal 
annual financial statements to the Finance and Administration Committee. 
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
13. Mr. Dominic Vallières from New Zealand was nominated as Chair of the Finance 
and Administration Committee (FAC). 
14. The Executive Secretary provided a brief presentation of the draft revised budget 
for 2019 (CCSBT-EC/1910/05), and the proposed budget for 2020 and indicative 
budget for 2021 - 2022 (CCSBT-EC/1910/06).   
15. The Executive Secretary noted that the 2020 draft budget and 2021 - 2022 
indicative budget includes funding to implement the Extended Scientific 
Committee’s (ESC) three-year workplan. Detailed consideration of the two 
budget papers was referred to the Finance and Administration Committee. 
16. Australia advised that work on its regulations to restore the GST exemption for 
the CCSBT is progressing and is expected to be completed in the next few 
months. Once implemented, Australia expects that the Secretariat will be able to 
claim GST paid back to June 2017. 
17. The FAC was convened to consider: 
• The revised budget for 2019; 
• The proposed budget for 2020; and  
• The indicative budget for 2021 - 2022. 
 
3.1. Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
18. The Chair of the FAC presented the report of the FAC, which is provided at 
Attachment 7. It includes: 
• A revised budget for 2019; 
• A budget for 2020;  
• Indicative budgets for 2021-2022; and 
• Consideration of changes to formal financial statements format. 
19. The Meeting thanked the FAC Chair and the FAC for its hard work. 
20. The EC adopted the report of the FAC, including the revised 2019 budget at 
Annex A and the budget for 2020 at Annex B. The EC also noted the indicative 
budgets for 2021-2022 at Annex B. 
21. The EC agreed to the FAC recommendation that it retain the current format for 
the CCSBT’s Annual Financial Statements. 
 
22. The EC agreed with the comment by FAC in its report that the endorsement of 
the additional expenses relating to close-kin genetics analysis should not be 
considered a precedent for increased budget in response to future increases in 
sample size based on stock size, and that the ESC should be encouraged to 
constrain costs in this area. 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries and ERS Interactions 
23. The Chair noted the deliberations of the Compliance Committee (CC) on 
Members’ National Reports and invited Members to ask any questions regarding 
Members’ National Reports additional to those already raised at the Fourteenth 
Meeting of the Compliance Committee (CC 14).  
24. Australia clarified that at this time it has not considered future recreational 
fishing surveys. 
25. No additional questions were asked in relation to Members’ National Reports. 
 
4.1. Reports on Members’ projects 
26. Australia presented paper CCSBT-EC/1910/26 on Australia’s progress towards 
implementation of stereo video. 
27. Some Members were disappointed with the progress and noted that stereo video 
monitoring is the best technology, as recommended by ESC, for measuring fish 
during farm transfers and provides good results in the Mediterranean, where it is 
mandatory. Some Members sought clarification from Australia as to why it can’t 
implement stereo video monitoring when countries in the Mediterranean are able 
to do so.  
28. Australia stated that it will adopt stereo video technology when it is able to 
satisfy its pre-conditions, being that it needs to be automated, in real-time, and 
the costs are comparable to current costs. Australia clarified that it is not planning 
to review the pre-conditions at this stage and has not currently committed to any 
pilot studies with stereo video or setting implementation timeframes until these 
pre-conditions are met. 
29. There was also some discussion of electronic monitoring (EM), noting that this 
can be a very useful technique, but that CCSBT’s scientific observer program 
standards requires human observers and that EM does not replace this 
requirement. Australia noted the need for EM to be allowed under CCSBT rules, 
the WCPFC process to develop EM standards, and the need to wait for this 
process to conclude. 
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
30. The independent Chair of the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
(ERSWG), Mr Alexander Morison, presented the report of the Thirteenth 
meeting of the ERSWG (ERSWG 13) which is summarised in papers CCSBT-
 
EC/1910/08 and CCSBT-EC/1910/19. The full ERSWG 13 Report is at 
Attachment 8.    
31. The EC adopted the: 
• Proposed revisions to the ERSWG Data Exchange, which is provided at 
Attachment 4 of the CC 14 Report; 
• Proposed revisions to the ERSWG Annual Report template, which is provided 
at Attachment 5 of the report of ERSWG 13. Footnote 10 of the template, for 
the Human Observer / EM column, will be changed to match footnote 10 of 
the ERSWG Data Exchange; and 
• Proposed overall objective and five specific objectives for a CCSBT Multi-
year Seabird Strategy, which is provided at attachment 7 of the report of 
ERSWG 13. 
32. The Meeting discussed the three options that were considered by the ERSWG for 
the definition of high-risk areas for seabirds. During discussions, it was noted 
that: 
• The ERSWG has previously wished to advise that best practice mitigation, as 
referred to in the 2012 ERSWG report, should be applied in high risk areas; 
• Fishing vessels may find operations difficult if the required mitigation 
measures are different depending on the area fished; and 
• A revision to the risk assessment is planned for the next ERSWG meeting, 
which is provisionally planned for 2021. 
33. The meeting did not agree to a definition of high-risk areas and the mitigation 
measures that should be used while operating in such areas. It was agreed to 
reconsider the matter at the next EC meeting. 
34. It was noted that the ERSWG had not amended its previous advice that the level 
of interaction between seabirds and SBT fisheries is still a significant concern. 
This risk assessment, applied to data from 2016, found that for nine of the 25 
albatross and petrel species the estimated annual incidental bycatch in surface 
longline fisheries exceeded the population productivity. One Member commented 
that the CCSBT needed to go beyond using the measures of other tuna RFMOs 
and introduce additional measures. One Member stated that this should be 
achieved by working with the other tuna RFMOs to seek strengthening of their 
measures, which would then apply to the CCSBT. 
35. It was noted that the ERSWG confirmed its previous advice that there were 
currently no specific concerns about shark bycatch that warranted additional 
mitigation requirements. 
36. The EC approved the ERSWG’s updated workplan, as presented in the report of 
ERSWG 13. 
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
37. The independent Chair of the CC, Mr Frank Meere, presented the report of CC 
14, outlining key points. It is provided at Attachment 9. 
 
38. The CC Chair highlighted the report’s workplan (paragraph 101) and combined 
notes/recommendations to the EC (paragraph 104), and thanked participants for a 
productive meeting.  
39. The European Union (EU) noted that it is satisfied with the use of the 
COMTRADE database to annually review trade statistics, but that the same 
issues of miscoding that have been discussed previously will likely remain, and 
that it would be more accurate to use the export/import information provided in 
its annual reports to the CC/EC or from CDS.  
40. Regarding a Quality Assurance Review (QAR) of the EU, the EU explained that 
it was amenable to a desktop review being conducted by the Secretariat at no 
cost, potentially based on the EU’s annual report to the CC/EC. Contracting a 
consultant to conduct the QAR would involve additional cost.  It was agreed that 
the CC Chair and the Compliance Manager should work together with input from 
interested Members to draft a Terms of Reference (ToR) for an EU QAR for 
consideration by the EC. 
41. The meeting agreed to the ToR for conducting an EU QAR with the provision 
that, based on the results of this initial QAR, the EC will determine whether any 
additional QAR assessments are necessary.  The agreed ToR is provided at 
Attachment 10.  
42. With regard to potentially developing an electronic CDS (eCDS), NZ noted that 
there is currently no line item included within the draft budget for this work to 
proceed.  There was also some discussion about additional costs that would be 
involved in supporting an eCDS including general maintenance and training costs 
as well as allowing for system amendments due to future revisions of the 
Resolution.   
43. Members supported developing a trial eCDS based on the current (2014) CDS 
Resolution, although Japan emphasised that there were still issues with the 2014 
CDS Resolution that would need to be resolved before it could agree to 
formalising any eCDS system that may be developed. There were further 
discussions that CCSBT should consider other RFMOs’ CDS systems while 
developing its own, including consideration of whether a CCSBT system should 
be completely different to other systems, for example, the eBCD system used by 
ICCAT. 
44. The EC adopted CC 14’s recommendations with the exception of items (b) and 
(j) which are contingent on the necessary funding being available, noting that: 
• Recommendation (b), “That the EC considers the lack of progress on the 
revised CDS resolution and decides if it wishes to move to an eCDS”, was 
agreed with an amendment that a trial eCDS should be developed based on the 
current 2014 CDS and its operational practices; 
• With respect to recommendation (g), the Executive Secretary confirmed that it 
is not necessary to amend the Rules of Procedure to permit intersessional 
decisions to be made regarding invitations – this is already permitted under 
current Rule 3(5); 
• Some items referred to under the paragraph 104 (‘Items to Note’) sub-header 
were considered to be recommendations (rather than items to note) and so 
require endorsement by the EC, these being: 
 
o (j): “The CC continues to support the $20,000 contingency fund to access 
Trygg Mat Tracking services if and when needed”, and needs to first be 
considered by the FAC as it has budget implications; 
o (m): “The CC agreed that it would be useful to have a review mechanism 
for papers from external parties, so that Members can make comments 
prior to these papers being formally submitted”; and 
o (o): “That three electronic intersessional groups have been established to 
progress further consideration of ….”, three matters. 
• Regarding (m) above it was agreed that the details of a review process for 
papers from external parties be drafted.  The meeting agreed a review process 
which is provided at Attachment 11. 
45. EC endorsed the CC 14’s report. 
46. The EC discussed whether to hold a one-day Informal Technical Compliance 
Working Group (TCWG) immediately before CC15 in 2020. The CC Chair 
advised that the TCWG is only convened on an ‘as-needed’ basis on technical 
compliance issues and that no items have arisen to date that would warrant 
discussion in 2020. The EC agreed that it would not be necessary to convene a 
TCWG in 2020. 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
47. The independent Chair of the ESC, Dr Kevin Stokes, presented the report of the 
ESC for the Twenty-Fourth meeting of the Scientific Committee (ESC 24), 
which is summarised in papers CCSBT-EC/1910/10 and CCSBT-EC/1910/20, 
and provided in full at Attachment 12. Presentation and discussion of the part of 
the ESC report relating to the development of a new Management Procedure 
(MP) was deferred to agenda item 9.    
48. The EU noted that the objective of reaching 30% initial biomass by 2030 had not 
been assessed, which had been agreed at last year’s annual meeting and the EU 
considered this to be important as it thought that the CCSBT should be ambitious 
with respect to stock recovery. The ESC Chair later noted that the agreement at 
ESC 25 was to provide a performance statistic related to EU’s request. This has 
been done and is shown in Attachment 10 (Table 3) of ESC 25 report but was not 
adopted as a tuning criterion. 
49. Members had lengthy discussions concerning the recommendations from the 
farm and market experts and on actions to take in relation to the farm and market 
isues. 
50. Japan proposed that: 
• It would prepare, in consultation with the Secretariat, a proposal for an 
analysis of the Japanese market to present to the EC in 2020 and implement in 
2021, that would compare Japanese market data with catch data from all 
Members; and 
• Australia present an outlook for the implementation of stereo video to the EC 
in 2020, and if it can be developed then it can implement it in 2021. 
 
51. Japan commented that its decision on whether to proceed with the market 
analysis would be dependent on Australia’s progress with stereo video. 
52. Some Members agreed that there was a need for Australia to define timeframes 
and commit to milestones for its plans to meet its pre-conditions and implement 
stereo video. 
53. New Zealand referred to its position outlined in its Opening Statement and stated 
that the pre-conditions appear to be unachievable. 
54. Australia re-stated that it was committed to stereo video but that it must also 
satisfy its pre-conditions for stereo video before it can proceed and that it could 
not commit to a timeframe to implement stereo video. Australia also commented 
that it has reservations on the market analysis since an important data source 
from the Tokyo market was not being made available. 
55. Further discussion on the farm and market issues was deferred to Agenda Item 9, 
on the adoption of a new MP. 
56. Members noted that shortfin mako has been listed on CITES Appendix II but 
agreed that it was not necessary for the ESC or ERSWG to conduct work in 
relation to this, since it would be conducted by other RFMOs. 
57. Members also noted that SBT is currently classified by the IUCN as being 
critically endangered, and that this classification is due for review in 2019. It was 
agreed that the Secretariat should contact IUCN and provide information, with 
assistance from experts if required, to IUCN for its review of SBT’s 
classification. 
58. The meeting noted that Australia submitted two papers for this agenda item 
(papers CCSBT-EC/1910/27 and 28) relating to farms and markets.  
59. One Member queried whether “industry” papers could be presented by Members 
and the EC agreed that papers should either be Member papers, or could be 
submitted separately through the meeting observer mechanism. 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
8.1. Attributable SBT Catch 
60. The Chair noted that the EC has agreed to implementation of the Attributable 
SBT Catch from the 2018 season and opened the floor to discussion on how each 
Member has begun to account for its SBT mortalities.  
61. Members reported the amount of their 2018 national allocation set aside to 
account for recreational catch, customary catch, and discard mortalities: 
• Australia allocated 250t to account for its recreational catch; 
• The Fishing Entity of Taiwan (Taiwan) allocated 10t to account for discard 
mortalities; 
• South Africa allocated 5t to account for its recreational catch; 
• Korea allocated 5t to account for its discard mortalities; 
 
• New Zealand allocated 20t for its recreational fishery, 2t for customary catch, 
and 20t for discard mortalities; and 
• Japan allocated 20t for discard mortalities  
62. Australia reported that its national survey for recreational SBT catches began on 
1-Dec-2018 and would finish on 30-Nov-2019, with results expected during mid-
2020. Australia has made efforts to reduce mortalities in its recreational fishery 
with a communication and educational program for recreational fishers to 
promote catch and release fishing and release methods to increase SBT survival 
rates. 
63. Australia clarified that its longline vessels can only fish in an SBT zone when it 
has uncaught quota remaining. Discarded SBT must be live and vigorous and if 
not, such as when a fish is gaffed, then it is deducted from the fisher’s quota. 
64. The EU clarified that observer coverage of its Members fleets was varied and 
was 7-8% overall, but coverage for one of the fishing fleet segments in the Indian 
Ocean was only 1-2%. It intends to address this issue as the coverage should be 
at least 5%. 
65. Indonesia reported that its reported catches include small-scale fisheries catch, 
and it has investigated other fisheries but so far found no other source of SBT 
mortalities. 
66. South Africa advised that the rights of SBT right holders not active before or on 
the 31-May are transferred to other right holders that have been active in that 
season, and that if its TAC is reached or exceeded then the fishery is closed and 
SBT should be released. 
67. New Zealand presented paper CCSBT-EC/1810/21 regarding a proposal to 
amend the “Resolution on Limited Carry-forward of Unfished Annual Total 
Allowable Catch” to clearly specify how all components of the SBT Attributable 
Catch should be taken into consideration when determining carry-forward. 
68. The EC discussed New Zealand’s proposal and agreed to the revised Resolution 
at Attachment 13. 
 
8.2. TAC Determination 
69. The Chair noted that at CCSBT 23, the EC agreed to set the TAC for 2018-2020 
at 17,647 tonnes per year in accordance with the recommendation from the 
CCSBT’s MP. 
70. The EC accepted the ESC’s advice there were no exceptional circumstances that 
required the 2020 TAC to be revised, and the TAC for 2020 was confirmed at 
17,647t. 
71. The EC also accepted the ESC’s advice that there is no requirement for the EC to 
change the amount of the TAC that it has set aside to account for IUU catch by 
Non-Members. Consequently, 306t will be set aside to account for IUU catch by 
Non-Members in 2020. 
72. The ESC Chair confirmed that the existing MP is robust to uncertainties relating 
to unaccounted mortalities including those from farms. 
 
 
8.3. Research Mortality Allowance 
73. The Chair advised the meeting that the ESC had endorsed a total Research 
Mortality Allowance (RMA) of 3.1t to be set aside for 2020 as follows: 
• 2.0t for the CCSBT Gene Tagging Project; and 
• 1.1t to Japan for the projects listed in paper CCSBT-EC/1910/11 from the 
Secretariat. 
74. The EC approved these RMA requests. 
 
8.4. Allocation of TAC 
75. The Chair advised that the allocations and effective catch limits to Members for 
2018-2020 were agreed at CCSBT 23 and these allocations are provided on page 
3 of paper CCSBT-EC/1910/11 and are repeated in Table 1 below. The EC 
confirmed that the allocations for 2020 would be as agreed at CCSBT 23.

Agenda Item 9. 
Adoption of a new Management Procedure 
76. The Chair advised that the new CCSBT MP needs to be adopted by the EC if the 
ESC is to run that MP in 2020 and recommend the global Total Allowable Catch 
for 2021 to 2023 inclusive. This means that, in his view, a new MP should be 
adopted at this meeting (CCSBT 26). 
77. The ESC Chair presented ESC’s recommendations regarding the selection of a 
new MP, noting that the 5th Meeting of the Strategy and Fisheries Management 
Working Group (SFMWG 5) provided valuable guidance on long-term goals and 
desirable features of a new MP such as tuning biomass levels which form the 
basis for the ESC’s recommendations. 
78. In response to questions, the ESC Chair noted that: 
                                                 
 
1 These figures reflect the voluntary transfers of 21t that Japan is providing to Indonesia and 27t that Japan is 
providing to South Africa for the 2018 to 2020 quota block. The starting point for Japan, Indonesia and South 
Africa in considering the allocation from 2021 will be 6165t, 1002t, and 423t respectively. 
 
• The uncertainty in unreported catches is incorporated in the Operating Model 
(OM) (baseline grid) by including an assumed over-catch of 20% for the purse 
seine fishery as well as 1000t each of small and large fish which gives the OM 
a lot of buffering with respect to potential unreported catch; 
• The ESC decided to recommend only a single candidate MP (RH13) to reach a 
target biomass of 30% of SSB0 by 2035 with a 50% probability, and to allow a 
maximum 3000t TAC change;  
• If the maximum TAC change was decreased from 3000t to 2000t there would 
be no overall improvement in conservation performance but there would be 
slightly lower TACs overall;  
• If the maximum TAC change was increased to 4000t there would be no overall 
improvement in conservation performance but average annual variation in 
catch and the probability of a TAC decrease following increases would be 
slightly increased; and 
• To change the objectives of the MP now would mean re-doing all the work 
already conducted by ESC and there wouldn’t be a scientific basis upon which 
to set the TAC at next year’s meeting; in addition there would be implications 
to the ESC’s WorkPlan and its associated budget. 
79. One Member noted it preferred that the objective should be to reach spawning 
stock associated MSY as soon as possible and that any possible increase in TAC 
should be moderate. 
80. Another Member noted that if the recommended MP is not agreed, then it 
understands that the EC can still set a TAC without guidance from a MP. The 
ESC Chair noted that in the absence of an MP the ESC would need a framework 
for providing advice based on stock assessment and that this might require 
intersessional work. Further, the ESC would require a framework that could lead 
to advice on TAC decreases as well as increases if incoming data so suggest. 
81. The meeting discussed how the farm and market experts’ recommendations could 
be taken into account to reduce uncertainties in the MP. New Zealand noted it 
was concerned that an over-catch of 20% in the farm sector was accepted as a 
component of the MP.  Australia commented that the assumed over-catch has not 
been verified. 
82. New Zealand reiterated its concern relating to the lack of resolution of 
uncertainties noting the large number of papers exchanged on potential 
unreported catch and in particular the views of the independent scientific experts 
on the farm analysis.  
83. Members noted that the MP is a tool to assist the EC to make decisions on the 
TAC.  Therefore, the decision on whether to adopt the ESC’s recommended 
candidate MP (RH13) will be separated from the TAC setting decision which 
will occur in 2020.  However, some Members highlighted that the MP is not 
completely disassociated from factors leading to uncertainty that could influence 
the results of the MP. 
84. Australia advised its preference to move towards resolving uncertainties in the 
farm sector is to continue to work on the introduction of Stereo Video (SV) 
monitoring technology and that it had been working hard to progress SV’s 
implementation.  Australia further advised that any introduction of SV 
 
technology would need to occur over a two to three-year period to ensure the 
necessary regulations and technology could be implemented. 
85. Australia committed to submit a paper at least 4 weeks prior to CCSBT 27 
providing a plan on its efforts to implement SV. An alternative outlook could be 
provided to improve confidence in the sampling system (currently the 100 fish 
greater than or equal to 10kg sample), seeking advice on protocols to avoid 
sampling bias from ESC 25. 
86. Japan committed to submit a paper to the ESC and CCSBT 27, which will 
include a proposal to compare Japanese market data with catch data from all 
Members to identify any anomalies or discrepancies.  
87. Members agreed to adopt the recommended MP, noting that the TAC that will be 
recommended by the MP will be considered separately at CCSBT 27. The 
decision on the TAC should also consider other information such as the 
sustainability of the SBT stock and fisheries as well as the papers and proposals 
that Australia will provide on SV and Japan will provide on markets. 
88. New Zealand and the EU advised that at CCSBT 27, they would need to see that 
there had been real and measurable progress towards resolving current farm 
uncertainties and satisfactory progress on the market study proposal to 
investigate uncertainties before they could agree to any increased TAC that may 
be recommended by the MP.  
89. The EC requested that the ESC provide advice on the timeframe that would be 
needed to reach SSBMSY if the TAC is maintained at its current level. 
90. The EC agreed to a modified Resolution on the Adoption of a Management 
Procedure. The adopted Resolution is at Attachment 14. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Ecologically Related Species (ERS) 
91. The Chair referred to the Secretariat’s paper CCSBT-EC/1910/13, which has 
three components:  
• A draft update to the ERS measures in the new ERS Resolution2 to take 
account of recent decisions taken on ERS at the Annual Meetings of the IOTC, 
WCPFC, and ICCAT. 
• A recommendation to end the CCSBT’s 1997 requirement to use Tori 
pole/lines south of 30oS and to discontinue the CCSBT’s 1999 guidelines for 
the design and deployment.  The recommendation included incorporating the 
Tori pole/lines requirement within the new ERS Resolution for when fishing 
outside Areas of Competence as defined in that Resolution. 
• A proposal for some changes to the CCSBT’s ERS Recommendation3 to 
update that recommendation to take into account the new ERS Resolution. 
92. The EC agreed to: 
• Adopt the revised ERS Resolution at Attachment 15; 
                                                 
 
2 Resolution to Align CCSBT’s Ecologically Related Species measures with those of other tuna RFMOs. 
3 Recommendation to Mitigate the Impact on Ecologically Related Species of Fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna. 
 
• Discontinue the CCSBT’s 1997 requirement to use Tori pole/lines south of 
30oS and discontinue the CCSBT’s 1999 guidelines for the design and 
deployment of Tori pole/lines; and 
• Adopt the revised ERS Recommendation at Attachment 16. 
93. The Chair advised that the Secretariat had presented a paper (CCSBT-
CC/1910/05) to the CC on Members’ implementation of ERS measures, and 
Members’ performance with respect to ERS. The EC agreed that, as the paper 
had already been considered by the CC, it did not require further consideration by 
the EC.  
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Terms of Reference and Panel for the Performance Review of 
the CCSBT 
94. The EC considered the Secretariat’s paper CCSBT-EC/1910/14 on a Terms of 
Reference for the 2021 Performance Review of the CCSBT.  
95. The EC agreed to the Terms of Reference for the Performance Review at 
Attachment 17. These Terms of Reference include: 
• Composition, operation, selection and funding of the Performance Review 
Panel; 
• Criteria for evaluating the CCSBT’s performance; 
• Resources available to the Panel; 
• Report of the Performance Review; and  
• Process for consideration and follow-up of Performance Review 
recommendations 
96. The meeting noted that the report of the performance review panel would be 
provided to the EC as a finalised report and that there would not be formal 
process where Members could review the report and suggest changes. However, 
it was further noted that the EC would review the final recommendations and 
decide which recommendations would be accepted for implementation. 
97. One Member considered that the report should identify any divergent views 
amongst the review panel. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Review of Convention text 
98. The Chair advised that a variety of views were expressed at CCSBT 25 on the 
need to update the Convention text. Most Members at CCSBT 25 considered 
revision of the Convention to be a low priority. One Member considered that 
there was no need to revise the Convention, while some other Members thought 
it was important to explore ways to extend full membership to Fishing entities 
and REIOs4, and/or to modernise the Convention. CCSBT 25 agreed that 
interested Members would communicate intersessionally and possibly prepare a 
                                                 
 
4 Regional Economic Integration Organisations. 
 
paper(s), on reflections regarding the Convention including a work plan on 
potential revisions for discussion at CCSBT 26. 
99. The Chair further advised that in January 2019, a letter from the EU was 
distributed in CCSBT Circular #2019/006, which amongst other things, advised 
that internal EU discussions concluded that “at this stage, the revision of the 
Convention should be postponed in favour of other pressing CCSBT priorities 
until better opportunities emerge, notable in terms of time planning and 
definition of priorities to relaunch these discussions.”. 
100. The EC agreed that a review of the Convention text was not considered to be a 
high priority at the present time, but that this will be reconsidered at a future 
meeting if requested by any Member.  
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
101. The Secretariat presented paper CCSBT-EC/1910/15 on CCSBT’s relationship 
with non-Members and advised that the China, Fiji, Mauritius, Singapore and the 
USA had been invited to attend the meetings of the CC and EC. Singapore and 
the USA responded that they would not be able to attend, but hoped to be able to 
attend future meetings. The Secretariat also advised that there has been 
considerable interaction between the CCSBT Secretariat and non-Member States 
and other organisations during 2019, mostly in the compliance area. 
102. It was clarified that Tristan da Cunha has no active SBT fishery at this point in 
time, but that SBT is occurring around its waters. 
103. In relation to the People’s Republic of China (China), the Secretariat advised the 
EC that: 
• In January 2019, China issued a Notification that specifies no retention, 
transhipping and landing of SBT, releasing of incidentally caught SBT, and 
recording of SBT in log books. China’s Notification also prohibits fishing in 
some SBT areas at some times, but not all SBT areas at all times. 
• The outcome of China’s investigation, including DNA sampling, concerning 
alleged illegal fishing activities in 2018 by vessels registered to China was 
that: “According to the information available at present, there is no evidence 
indicating that the Ping Tai Rong Leng 2 has conducted illegal transhipment 
at sea of southern bluefin tuna.”. 
104. It was agreed that the CCSBT should write a letter to China asking for 
confirmation of the implementation of its regulations concerning SBT area 
closures and non-retention of SBT, including whether China is using VMS to 
monitor compliance of its vessels with the closures and China’s level of SBT 
discarding. 
105. One Member commented that when a new Member joins the CCSBT, the new 
Member should not affect or diminish the rights of equal participation, status and 
nomenclature of existing Members. However, it was noted that States can accede 
to the Convention without permission of any existing Member. One Member 
noted that the process of providing an allocation to a new Member would likely 
impact on existing Members’ allocations. 
 
106. The meeting was advised that the USA has continued its cooperation with the 
CCSBT’s Catch Documentation Scheme, and the EC expressed appreciation for 
the USA’s continued cooperation. 
107. The EC agreed that the Secretariat should repeat its invitations to China, Fiji, 
Mauritius, Singapore and the USA for CC 15 and CCSBT 27, and also invite 
Namibia. The Secretariat will provide drafts of the invitation letters to non-
Members to Members for comment before they are sent. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Kobe Process 
108. The Secretariat presented paper CCSBT-EC/1910/16 which provided an update 
in relation to Kobe process and joint tuna RFMO activities, as well as a link to 
reports from projects conduct through the Common Oceans ABNJ Tuna Project. 
109. In relation to the report from the second meeting of the joint tuna RFMO FAD 
working group, the EC advised that FADs are not used in SBT fisheries and that 
CCSBT representation at FAD meetings is not a priority for the CCSBT. 
110. Japan provided a detailed summary of the outcomes of the joint tuna RFMO 
meeting on the Ecosystems Approach to Fisheries that was held in September 
2019. 
111. The EC noted that an Australian participant of the ESC would participate at the 
upcoming Joint Tuna RFMO Bycatch Working Group meeting on sharks for the 
CCSBT. 
112. It was suggested that a CCSBT representative participates in the joint tRFMO 
Bycatch Working group. Furthermore, ACAP commented that it would be useful 
for the Joint Tuna RFMO Bycatch Working Group to consider holding a meeting 
in relation to seabird bycatch and effectiveness of mitigation. 
113. The EC also noted that if a meeting of the Management Strategy Evaluation 
(MSE) Working Group is held then the CCSBT should be actively involved since 
it is a front-runner in MSE. 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
15.1. Reports from other RFMO meetings of interest  
114. The Chair introduced this item which is summarised in the Secretariat’s paper 
CCSBT-EC/1610/17 on activities with other organisations. 
115. The following reports were provided by Members as part of their Observer duties 
for the CCSBT. 
• A verbal report by Korea on the on 15th Regular Session of the Western and 
Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC);  
• Australia’s report (CCSBT-EC/1910/25) on the 37th Annual Meeting of the 
Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
(CCAMLR);  
 
• Indonesia’s report (CCSBT-EC/1910/24) on the Twenty Third Session of the 
Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC);  
• Japan’s report (CCSBT-EC/1910/23) on the 21st Special Meeting of the 
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT); 
and 
• Taiwan’s report (CCSBT-EC/1910/22) on the 2019 Annual Meeting of the 
Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). 
116. Indonesia informed to Members that Indonesia will organise 24th Session of the 
IOTC Commission from 31 May to 12 June 2020 following the 4th Bali Tuna 
Conference (BTC) and the 7th International Coastal Tuna Business Forum 
(ICTBF) as back to back meetings in Bali. Furthermore, Indonesia intends to 
invite Executive Secretary of CCSBT and one Member of CCSBT to be keynote 
speakers in BTC/ICTBF 2020. 
117. It was agreed that the following Members would act as Observers to other 
RFMOs on behalf of CCSBT during 2019/20: 
• Korea to continue as Observer to WCPFC; 
• New Zealand would become the Observer to CCAMLR; 
• Indonesia to continue as Observer to IOTC; 
• Japan to continue as an Observer to ICCAT; and 
• Taiwan to continue as an Observer to IATTC. 
 
15.2. 
Arrangement with CCAMLR  
118. The Secretariat advised the meeting that the renewed Arrangement with 
CCAMLR was signed in January 2019. The Secretariat further advised that 
CCSBT and CCAMLR Secretariats had planned to develop an implementation 
plan for the renewed arrangement to facilitate enhanced cooperation. However, 
the plan is not a priority and has not been progressed. Nevertheless, regular 
communication and cooperation continues between the CCSBT and CCAMLR 
Secretariats.  
 
Agenda Item 16. 
Confidentiality of Data and Documents 
16.1.   Confidentiality of reports and documents from 2019 
119. The Chair introduced paper CCSBT-EC/1910/18 on the confidentiality of reports 
and documents submitted as meeting documents during 2019.   
120. The meeting noted that all the reports of meetings and documents submitted to 
meetings under the jurisdiction of CCSBT 26 would be made publicly available 
with the following exceptions: 
• Attachment A of paper CCSBT-ESC/1909/04 from the Secretariat titled 
“Secretariat Review of Catches”; 
• Paper CCSBT-ESC/1909/20 from Japan titled “Update of estimation for the 
unaccounted catch mortality in Australian SBT farming in the 2018 fishing 
season”; 
 
• Paper CCSBT-ESC/1909/21 from Japan titled “Monitoring of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna trading in the Japanese domestic markets: 2019 update”; 
• Paper CCSBT-ESC/1909/23 from Japan titled “Approach to the verification of 
reported catch of southern bluefin tuna by all CCSBT member countries using

for a presentation titled “Reconciling Japan market data and catch data for 
SBT”; and 
• Paper CCSBT-EC/1910/28 from Australia titled “Japan Market Update and 
Comments on the 2019 Advice of the CCSBT expert”. 
121. The meeting also noted that fifteen “BGD” papers submitted to the ESC this year 
have been previously classified as confidential by the EC and that the re-
submitted versions of these papers should also be classified as being confidential. 
These papers are CCSBT-ESC/1909/BGD 08, 17, 21, 23 and 25-35. 
 
Agenda Item 17. 
Meetings for 2020 
122. It was agreed that the following meetings and dates would apply for 2020: 
• The 25th Extended Scientific Committee meeting, in Tokyo, Japan from 31 
August to 5 September 2020;  
• The 15th Compliance Committee Meeting, in Sapporo, Japan from 8 to 10

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
On behalf of the Australian delegation, I would like to begin by thanking South Africa 
and the wonderful city of Cape Town for hosting this meeting. I understand this is the 
first time the Extended Commission has met in South Africa, after South Africa 
joined the Commission in 2016. I am looking forward to a fruitful and effective 
meeting over the next four days. 
Thank you also to the Chair of the meeting, Mr Saasa Pheeha, for his participation, 
and the Secretariat, as always, for their work in preparing for the meeting and 
throughout the year.  I would also like to acknowledge the presence of the 
independent chairs of our subcommittees, Dr Stokes, Mr Meere and Mr Morison. 
This year we are tasked with agreeing a new management procedure.  I am told there 
has been some excellent cooperation in creating candidate management procedures 
and narrowing the range of options down to one. I am conscious of the vital role of 
the management procedure in recovering the stock and providing certainty for 
Members and stakeholders and am keen for us to move to the new procedure as 
quickly and seamlessly as possible.  
A focus for Australia again this year will be on how we collectively address wildlife 
interactions in the fishery. I understand these issues were discussed last week and 
some good progress has been made. As the fishery rebuilds, it should be our goal that 
the number of fishing related ecologically related species mortalities declines both as 
a percentage of fishing but also in real terms.  
I would like to thank in advance our translators who have the difficult task of keeping 
up with complex discussions and sometimes very enthusiastic presenters. I hope none 
of us on our side set off the red light during the meeting.  
Australia is committed to working constructively with all Members to achieve the best 
outcomes for the CCSBT.  
Thank you. 
Attachment 4 – 2 
 
Opening Statement by the European Union 
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
The EU Delegation is very pleased to be present at the 26th Annual Meeting of 
CCSBT. I would like first of all to thank South Africa for the very warm welcome, for 
hosting the annual meeting in Cape Town and for the conditions provided. We would 
also like to thank the Secretariat for the preparatory work. 
The EU is a major fishing player and fish producer, the world’s largest importer, in 
market value, of fish and fish products and one of the biggest consumers of fish. 
However in CCSBT, the EU has limited direct interest either in terms of catches or 
imports. Notwithstanding, the EU continues to be strongly committed to ensuring 
compliance with conservation and management measures and contribute to the sound 
management of the Southern Bluefin Tuna stock and to promote good governance and 
coherence amongst tuna RFMOs, namely by sharing experiences from other RFMOs. 
The European Union looks forward to benefit from the work and recommendations of 
science in general and particularly from the Scientific Committee and the Ecological 
Related Species Working Group in support to the adoption of conservation and 
management measures aiming at the sustainable exploitation of the natural resources. 
The EU is also strongly committed to ensuring and support compliance in CCSBT.  
We have an extensive agenda full of important points but, not being exclusive, I 
would like to highlight a couple of topics.  
The new Management Procedure that will be made available in October 2020 to 
determinate the TAC for the next 3-year block period is an essential matter that will 
be addressed this year. The EU aims at rebuilding the SBT stock, as fastest as 
practicable, by reaching the spawning biomass level that would produce the 
Maximum Sustainable Yield and keep the level of fisheries also ensuring the MSY. 
Another agenda point concerns the analysis of farming and market data and the 
related recommendations made by the Scientific Committee. In this regard, the EU 
looks for the adoption of practical measures leading to the sound management of the 
SBT fisheries, particularly contributing to solve remaining doubts on SBT mortalities.  
Once again, we will also contribute to endorse the recommendations made by the 
Compliance Committee. On Monitoring, Control and Surveillance measures the EU 
globally aligns with the situation and experiences from other tuna RFMOs. 
To conclude, I would like to underline our willingness to work constructively and co-
operatively with all CCSBT Contracting Parties this week, in order to finish on a 
successful and positive note on Thursday. 
Thank you for your attention.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen, Good 
morning. 
On behalf of Taiwan delegation, I would like to extend our appreciation to the 
Republic of South Africa for hosting this event in beautiful Cape Town. 
Moreover, I would also like to thank Mr. Kennedy, the Executive Secretary and the 
Secretariat staffs for your hard work in preparing the meeting documents and the 
arrangement this meeting. 
Taiwan pays considerable attention to the development of a proper management 
procedure for sustainable utilization of Southern Bluefin Tuna resource. We 
understand the new MP development that resulted in sharing of knowledge, data, code 
and learning. The new MP advised by ESC for determining the Total Allowable Catch 
for 2021 to 2023 and the performance is well across wide range of attributes. Thanks 
to the excellent work done by the Operating Model and Management Procedure 
Technical Group and Extended Scientific Committee, equip the Extended 
Commission with adequate information to select a new MP. In order to set the global 
TAC on schedule, Taiwan sincerely hopes that the Extended Commission can adopt a 
robust new MP this year. 
Regarding to Ecologically Related Species, we believe that the mitigation and 
conservation of such species is an important subject for SBT fisheries management. 
To this end, Taiwan has made its effort to comply with the Conservation and 
Management Measure for Ecologically Related Species of relevant tuna Regional 
Fisheries Management Organizations. We appreciate the good progress made in the 
ERSWG this year. 
To conclude my remark, I look forward to working with all members in the following 
days to achieve constructive outcomes. With the cooperation of every member, I 
believe that we can make further contributions to the sustainability and proper 
management of SBT fishery. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Honorable Chairman and Executive Secretary of the Commission, 
Distinguished Delegates, Observers, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, I would like to thank to 
the Government of the Republic of South Africa, particularly the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries for rendering your hospitality and hosting this 
meeting in this beautiful city of Cape Town. I am also taking this opportunity to 
express our sincere appreciation to the Chair of the Extended Commission, Mr. Saasa 
Pheeha, Executive Secretary, Mr. Robert Kennedy and all Chairs of the Committees 
and Working Group as well as Secretariat Staffs for their work throughout the year, 
and for always making excellent jobs in arranging all preparatory works to this 
meeting. 
To begin the Opening Statement, I would like to share our sympathy and deepest 
condolence to the Government and People of Japan who are currently experiencing a 
typhoon disaster. I wish there is no victims and your people are able to recover very 
soon. 
Honorable chairman and distinguished delegates, as we noted in the past few years, 
the Extended Scientific Committee continued to provide empirical evidences that the 
rebuilding stock of SBT still remains gave us the positive signal with the level of 
rebuilding spawning biomass will be achieved faster than expected by Bali Tuna 
Management Plan.  Having this scientific background, Indonesia would like to 
express our high expectation that all CCSBT Members in this 26th Annual Meeting 
will agree to select the new Management Procedures (MP) to replace the Bali 
Management Procedure which has been implemented since 2011. In this conjunction, 
the selection of the new MP should consider socio-economic fairness among the 
Members, while ensuring sustainability of SBT in the future. The new MP should 
ensure inevitability for the conducive and prospective investment of SBT fisheries in 
the long term basis, certainty of increasing cumulative TAC is along with the stability 
of the premium price of SBT in the future.  
In this good opportunity, I would also like to inform you that the Government of the 
Republic of Indonesia has taken several MCS improvement related to the 
conservation and management of SBT Fisheries, among others to address the IMO 
number issues, Indonesia now agreed to move forward to revise the CCSBT 
Authorized Vessel List Resolution.  Indonesia also concerns with the issues of the 
development of new e-CDS to assist particularly for developing countries to improved 
their MCS, however e-CDS has been established in Indonesia therefore the transition 
to the new system should consider compatibility aspects with the existing national 
system among the member. 
As the pioneer state in relation to the campaign against IUU Fishing Activities in the 
global level, Indonesia is persistent to commit and support any measures for 
combating IUU fishing practices particularly in the CCSBT, such utilization of AIS 
and VMS Data for detection of suspected illegal activities as well as market 
information for tracking of unreported/untagged SBT should highly be considerable.    
To conclude my remarks, I wish all important agenda to be deliberated this week on 
this commission meeting will provide the fruitful results which can contribute 
significantly to our joint efforts to meet the CCSBT objectives. With that, I would like 
to underline our willingness to work constructively and co-operatively with other 
delegations to a success of this meeting. 
Thank you. 
Attachment 4 – 5 
 
Opening Statement by Japan 
 
On behalf of the Japanese Delegation, I would like to make an opening statement. 
First of all, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to South Africa for hosting 
this meeting here in Cape Town. I would also like to extend our thanks to the 
Executive Secretary, Mr. Kennedy and the staff of the CCSBT Secretariat for their 
tireless efforts for organizing this meeting, as well as to the interpreters who always 
do excellent job. 
The most important issue at this meeting is the adoption of a new management 
procedure (MP). The Scientific Committee (SC) extensively discussed this issue this 
September, following the substantive discussion at the Strategy and Fisheries 
Management Working Group and the Commission meeting last year. The 
conservation and management utilizing the MP is one of the most unique features of 
the CCSBT, enabling it to make proper management decisions even under some 
uncertainties. We believe that adoption of the new MP at this meeting would add 
further credibility to CCSBT and at the same time demonstrate that CCSBT is the 
front runner in this area among tuna RFMOs. We look forward to working with other 
Members toward this goal. 
Even with the MP, it is important to minimize uncertainties relating to catch of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT), whether it is attributable to Members or non-Members. 
The SC agreed that implementation of stereo-video cameras is the only direct 
methodology for addressing the uncertainty relating to Australian SBT farming. The 
SC also agreed that the recent Japanese market data shows no clear signal of anomaly 
of SBT catch by Japanese vessels and recommended updating the estimation for catch 
verification of all Members. To further strengthen the robustness of the MP, we once 
again request Australia to take positive actions on stereo-video cameras and would 
like to engage in frank and constructive discussion with the Secretariat and other 
Members on the Commission-wide catch verification scheme using Japan’s market 
data. In this process, it is essential to address uncertainties attributable to Non-
members through various available approaches, with proper cautions.  
Finally, I would like to conclude my remark by expressing my hope that we will be 
able to make an important step forward for the future development of the CCSBT and 
re-building of SBT stock, through a constructive discussion among all participants 
during this four day meeting. 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Tena koutou katoa 
(Hello everybody) 
Firstly may I express our thanks to South Africa for hosting this 26th meeting of 
CCSBT. Cape Town is certainly a spectacular city and members of our delegation 
have enjoyed their time here so far. 
Secondly our thanks to the members of the Secretariat and the members and Chairs of 
our subsidiary bodies for their work during the course of the year. 
I will be brief. The issues before us are well known. We have been lucky. Nature has 
given us a significant helping hand in rebuilding the southern Bluefin tuna stock. This 
gives us the opportunity to be more ambitious in setting targets for a new management 
procedure and New Zealand is a strong advocate of that approach. 
However, it is a fact that New Zealand’s interests as a range state have been 
undermined by past unreported catches of southern Bluefin tuna. We also believe that 
the continued failure to resolve uncertainty in farm and market reporting further 
undermines our and other Members’ interests. 
Despite raising these concerns regarding farm and market uncertainties over a number 
of years this Commission has yet to see a clear path to their resolution. It is our 
position that real and measurable progress is a precursor to the adoption of a new 
management procedure for this commission and any future increases in the global 
total allowable catch.  
It is the complacency that we have observed on these issues that has driven us to this 
position. It is not in our interest to hold up the implementation of a new management 
procedure so we have not reached this position lightly. We have considered the 
outcome of the recent meeting of the scientific committee and note the initiatives 
proposed by Japan and the advice of the farm and market experts. We have also 
considered the Australian paper on progress towards implementation of stereo video. 
There is clearly more work to be done and concrete milestones need to be set. We 
look forward to hearing proposals from other members on how we can move forward 
to resolve these long standing issues.   
That’s all I have to say about that for now. 
Thank you 
Attachment 4 – 7 
 
Opening Statement by Republic of Korea 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  
To begin with, on behalf of the Korean delegation, I would like to extend our sincere 
appreciation to the Government of South Africa for hosting the 26th annual meeting 
of the Commission in this beautiful and dynamic city of Cape Town. Also, Korea 
thanks the Executive Secretary and Secretariat staff very much for their usual 
excellent meeting arrangements, especially for their professional work and enthusiasm 
in preparing the meeting documents.  
Mr. Chairman,  
This delegation believes that the Southern Bluefin Tuna resources gradually recovered 
over the last ten years or so and consequently, we were able to increase the global 
TAC continuously. Korea believes this is a good example of an effective management 
of marine resources and therefore, would like to commend all Members and the 
Secretariat for their dedication and hard work done so far.  
However, we believe there is still much work to do in front of us to strengthen and 
further refine the scientific work of the Commission in a manner that minimizes 
uncertainties and increases robustness in the stock assessment, as is always the case in 
the other RFMOs as well.  
To this end, as Members may be aware, Korea has conducted various scientific 
research activities including otolith analysis and pop-up tagging program, in addition 
to its improved reporting and MCS systems which ensure more organized data 
collection. In this context, we would like to reassure the Members that Korea will 
remain committed to making its utmost effort to contribute to the work of the 
Commission and the subsidiary Committees in future years.  
In this meeting, we have many important issues to discuss and agree upon including 
the allocation of TAC and the adoption of a new Management Procedure. Although 
the respective positions of Members may differ in each agenda item, I think our 
common and ultimate goal is the same and we have no doubt that the Commission 
will be able to reach consensus on any issues if Members work constructively in the 
spirit of cooperation and compromise. 
Having said that, we very much look forward to working with the Chairman, all 
Members, NGOs and the Secretariat this week, bearing in mind the objective of the 
Convention which is the conservation and optimum utilization of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna. 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by South Africa 
 
Chairperson,  
CCSBT Executive Secretary,  
Esteemed Members, Delegates and Observers, all Protocol observed.  
First of all, I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the Republic of South 
Africa, to welcome you to the 26th Annual Meeting of the Extended Commission of 
the CCSBT  in South Africa, and to our beautiful, water scarce city of Cape Town, 
also affectionately known as the Mother City. Looking at actual data, you will 
understand that Cape Town water levels have improved significantly over the past 
few months, following the worst droughts in centuries. I hope that you will take note 
of the existing water restrictions and keep your showers short, and drink wine instead 
of water! 
South Africa’s commitment to Regional Fisheries Management Organisations 
(RFMO’s) is unquestionable.  South Africa is a Contracting Party to a number of 
Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) including three tuna 
RFMO’s, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), 
the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the 
Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC). In addition, South Africa is a founding 
member of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living 
Resources (CCAMLR). Very recently, we have acceded to The Agreement on Port 
State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated 
Fishing. As such, South Africa is obligated to comply with all relevant Conservation 
Management Measures adopted by the aforesaid RFMOs.   
South Africa had to establish sound institutional arrangements and most importantly 
participate in the existing platforms that provide robust engagements on fisheries and 
sustainable management thereof and optimize the social and economic benefits from 
our oceans. Fisheries stimulates local economic activity and job creation for fishers, 
who enjoy longer and more sustained employment, and through the grading, packing, 
processing and value adding of the fish. Similarly, economic activity is enjoyed by 
local Airfreight companies who are tasked to transport and export the fresh produce to 
the international markets. The local fresh operations create further extensive onshore 
support services for supplies, food, fuel, bait food, gear, etc. Repair and maintenance 
of these operations are extensive and offer extensive employment on shore. As a 
developing nation, South Africa is well placed in terms of its geographic location and 
its available infrastructure to further develop its tuna directed fisheries and in 
particular the fishery for SBT and consequently deriving maximum economic benefit 
for its citizens. 
Chairperson, I am confident that the 26th Annual Meeting of the Extended 
Commission of the CCSBT will have constructive, fruitful discussions and good 
decisions that are guided by mutual respect, fairness as well as by the desire to 
sustainably manage the SBT population for the benefit of all and including future 
generations.  
Excellences, 
Management and compliance with best national and international instruments so as 
conserve fish resources for future generations is important. I wish you all successful 
deliberations and I hope that you will have some time to go around and explore Cape

Opening Statement by  
the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) 
 
Bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries is one of the greatest threats to seabirds, 
particularly albatrosses and petrels. The Agreement on the Conservation of 
Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP https://acap.aq/) through its 13 Parties strives to 
conserve albatrosses and petrels by coordinating international activities to mitigate 
threats to their populations.   
This year ACAP's Advisory Committee declared that a conservation crisis continues 
to be faced by its 31 listed species, with thousands of albatrosses, petrels and 
shearwaters dying every year as a result of fisheries operations. Despite efforts that 
have been put into researching and recommending effective bycatch mitigation 
measures to address seabird bycatch in fisheries by ACAP and other bodies, in many 
instances these were not being implemented or were not being fully implemented.  A 
lack of compliance with seabird bycatch mitigation measures adopted by those 
Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) responsible for high-seas 
tuna fisheries, including the CCSBT, was identified as a critical issue. Within 
jurisdictions where implementation of effective mitigation measures and appropriate 
enforcement has occurred, reductions in seabird bycatch have been demonstrated, 
sometimes dramatically so and without perceived detrimental consequences arising.  
Given the conservation crisis facing albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters, ACAP is in 
the process of developing new and augmented areas of focus and activities for the 
immediate and longer term, and would like to work with RFMOs and others to 
enhance implementation of strategies and actions to reduce bycatch of seabirds in 
fishing operations, acknowledging that this needs to be done at a range of different 
scales. In addition, ACAP is working to communicate more effectively the 
conservation crisis facing albatrosses and petrels, and its advice regarding how best to 
address the threats that these seabirds face.

Opening Statement by BirdLife International 
 
Thank you for the opportunity for BirdLife to attend this meeting as an observer. 
This year there have been a few positive steps in relation to SBT fisheries and 
threatened albatross populations. In particular, drafting is planned for the new CCSBT 
multi-year seabird strategy which we believe is highly important for future CCSBT 
progress. In addition, a project funding concept has been developed for actions to 
enhance implementation of seabird bycatch measures, which we hope this Extended 
Commission will endorse. We also appreciate the efforts made by some Members to 
enhance their robustness of reporting on seabird bycatch and mitigation measure use.  
However, the urgent and continuing conservation crisis facing albatrosses as a result 
of bycatch is unabated, as expressed this year by the Agreement for the Conservation 
of Albatrosses and Petrels. In 2019, the CCSBT ERSWG once again expressed its 
serious concern regarding the continuing level of albatross bycatch in SBT fisheries.  
With twenty years past now since CCAMLR members already fixed the same 
problem in sub-Antarctic toothfish fisheries, it’s past time that CCSBT Members find 
ways to turn the current reputational risk into the conservation success story that it can 
become. 
We believe the single most important action that can reverse current bycatch is 
increasing compliance with existing seabird bycatch regulations.  At this meeting, in 
addition to endorsing the seabird project concept, we call on the Extended 
Commission to make firm commitments to accelerate and strengthen CCSBT 
compliance with seabird measures, and to set seabird strategy objectives with clear 
timeframes. It is also important that the overall objective of the new multi-year 
seabird strategy fully reflects duties set out in the UN Fish Stocks Agreement and 
FAO Code of Conduct, namely to minimise bycatch as well as minimising impacts on 
populations. 
Thank you Chair and Members for your time.

Opening Statement by Pew Charitable Trusts 
 
The Pew Charitable Trusts thanks the secretariat and members for the opportunity to 
be here and observe the proceedings of this Commission.  We would also like to thank 
the government of South Africa for hosting the meetings and to the translators for 
their hard work over the current meetings. 
Pew’s International Fisheries program engages as an observer in most of the worlds 
RFMO’s with the objective of contributing to discussions to improve the management 
of the fisheries under their jurisdiction, and we look forward to doing so for the case 
of Southern Bluefin Tuna. 
Thank you Chair. 
Attachment 5 – 4 
 
Opening Statement by TRAFFIC 
 
Thank you, Mr Chairman.  
TRAFFIC thanks the Commission for the opportunity to participate as an observer to 
meetings of the Extended Commission and its other subsidiary bodies. We thank 
South Africa for hosting this meeting and the Secretariat for the preparation. We look 
forward to contributing to these critical deliberations.  
TRAFFIC welcomes the continued signs the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) stock is 
showing of recovery and will meet with 70% probability the interim rebuilding target 
of 20% of the initial spawning stock biomass by 2035. TRAFFIC, ever since the 
adoption of an interim target, has been requesting the Commission adopt a suitably 
precautionary long-term rebuilding target. We note the recommendation by the 
Extended Scientific Committee to this meeting that the 30% of initial spawning stock 
biomass by 2035 tuning be used for the selection of a new MP. We would support the 
development of a new MP using this tuning level but ask Commissioners to articulate 
clearly at this meeting what the long-term rebuilding target is for the spawning stock 
at a level representative of a precautionary target reference point. 
TRAFFIC notes the continued action of the Commission to address unaccounted SBT 
mortality and that specifically in this regard a CCSBT Non-Member, China, advised 
its fleet in 2019 to avoid catching and landing SBT, with prohibitions on SBT 
retention, area closures, transhipment and reporting requirements. To have confidence 
in the implementation of such requirements, this Commission should take steps for 
their verification and look to address other unaccounted mortalities, for example by 
acting on the recommendations made by the Farm and Market Experts to the 
Scientific Committee. As we move to a new MP, we need to have confidence the 
setting aside of 306 tonnes to account for IUU catch by Non-Members is adequate.  
Regarding Ecologically Related Species (ERS), we are concerned that some Members 
are not meeting targets for observer coverage or not reporting their ERS catches. 
TRAFFIC is concerned by the reported level of shark catch by Members that it is 
generally based on little information, while the estimates of catch, mortality and 
discard by some Members is extremely high for Blue Sharks. While we welcome the 
CCSBT Resolution on the use of ERS measures adopted by other RFMOs, we feel 
those measures are not specific enough to the sharks being caught by CCSBT 
Members and will not address or identify any issues of overfishing for the species 
until it is too late. TRAFFIC encourages the Commission to direct the Scientific 
Committee as a priority to assess status and management needs for sharks caught as 
part of CCSBT activities. 
TRAFFIC also notes the number of shark and ray species included within the 
appendices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
Fauna and Flora (CITES) and encourages the Commission to request the Compliance 
and Scientific Committees provide Members with adequate advice to meet their 
obligations when catching and trading in CITES-listed species. This will require 
advice on what constitutes a sustainable catch level of such species.  
Chair, we cannot emphasise enough that CCSBT needs to deal now with ensuring the 
catch of all ERS are at sustainable levels under the current SBT Total Allowable 
Catch (TAC). Unless this takes place, we may witness an unacceptable dramatic 
decrease in the conservation status of ERS given the potential increases in TAC and 
therefore fishing effort as the stock recovers.  
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
Mr Dominic Vallières (New Zealand) agreed to chair the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC). The FAC was tasked with the following agenda:  
• Revision of the 2019 budget  
• Draft 2020 budget  
• Draft indicative budgets for 2021 and 2022 
• Consider changes to a more modern reporting format for the formal financial 
statements 
 
Consideration of changes to formal financial statements format 
The FAC was invited to consider whether it wished to update the CCSBT’s Financial 
Statements into a more contemporary format. Such a change may make the statements 
easier to read for external audiences but would come at a cost of approximately 
$4,000.  
Members of the FAC did not consider that such a change was necessary and that the 
current reporting format was meeting the needs of this Commission. 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission retain the current format for 
the CCSBT’s Annual Financial Statements. 
The revised budget for 2019 
The Executive Secretary gave a summary of the 2019 revised budget outlined in 
CCSBT-EC/1910/05. The revision incorporates actual income and expenditure 
together with forecast income and expenditure for the remainder of the year.  
Expenditures for 2019 are forecast to total $2,929,800, which is a 5% decrease on the 
amount approved for 2019. The Secretariat was able to realise savings from a variety 
of sources including the use of Secretariat staff for the translation of meeting 
documents rather than an external translation services. Members of the FAC 
expressed their gratitude to the Deputy Executive Secretary in relation to the latter. 
The Executive Secretary provided additional details on individual items of the revised 
2019 budget where significant changes had occurred from the initially planned 
amounts. 
Following advice from the Chair of the ESC, changes were made to the expenses 
related to OM/MP given that no additional work is planned for the current financial 
year. The FAC also transferred funds from the statistical analysis associated with the 
maturity study from 2019 to 2020 as this work is not likely to be conducted until 
2020. 
Members of the FAC thanked the Secretariat for the revised budget and its efforts to 
reduce costs throughout the year. 
Australia provided an update on the status of the Secretariat tax exemption under the 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (Privileges and 
Immunities) Regulations 1996. Australia apologised for the delays in amending the 
regulations and explained that these were due to the Australian regulatory process and 
the recent federal election. 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission note the revised budget for 
2019 at Annex A. 
 
Draft budget for 2020 
The FAC considered the proposed budgets outlined in CCSBT-EC/1910/06, which 
includes funding for the CCSBT’s usual business.  
The draft budget for 2020 contained $39,000 more expenditure than the interim draft 
budget for 2020 that was provided in Circular #2019/051. This increased expenditure 
was related to the following two items from the updated Extended Scientific 
Committee (ESC) workplan 
• An additional $28,100 to enable 1,100 more tissue samples in the close-kin 
genetics work for estimating the abundance of the SBT spawning population; 
and; 
• An additional $10,400 for the Operating Model and Management Procedure 
Technical Meeting (OMMP) meeting to include consideration of the Scientific 
Research Plan, which will require attendance of the ESC Chair in addition to 
the full advisory panel and consultant. 
In discussion with the Chair of the ESC, the FAC considered the two additional 
requests from the ESC and endorsed their inclusion in the 2020 budget. It was noted 
however that the current endorsement of the additional expenses relating to close-kin 
analysis should not be considered as setting a precedent for increased budget in 
response to future increases in sample size based on stock size. The ESC should be 
encouraged to constrain costs in this area. 
In addition, decisions made at the EC carried financial ramifications and the FAC was 
asked to accommodate these decisions within the budgeting process. These include: 
• The development of a trial electronic Catch Documentation Scheme (eCDS) at 
a cost of $150,000; 
• A smaller scale Quality Assurance Review (QAR) for the European Union at a 
cost of $10,000; 
• A decision to transition to using the United Nations Pensionable Remuneration 
Table for the calculation of superannuation for Secretariat professional staff;  
• Continued contingency funding for ad-hoc AIS analysis; 
• The extension of the current Executive Secretary’s contract; and 
• Inclusion of an IOTC Contracting Party as a member of the CCSBT 
performance review panel. 
The FAC discussed how best to incorporate the changes within the 2020 budget given 
the sums involved. The additional costs associated with  the proposed changes, with 
the exception of the eCDS trial, were endorsed without the need for budget cuts.  
The funding requirements for the trial eCDS could not also be met with the current 
annual income or through cost savings in other areas. Two options were considered by 
the FAC: to withdraw from existing cash reserves and fund the trial immediately; or 
to delay the trial until such time that the anticipated Australian tax refund is received.  
The recommended option  of the FAC is to draw from existing Secretariat reserves to 
fund the development of a trial eCDS and the FAC believes this best reflects the 
decisions of the EC.  
The FAC notes that the CCSBT anticipates a tax refund from the Australian Taxation 
Office in the coming year and recommends that, once received, these funds be put 
back into cash reserves to offset this additional withdrawal. In reaching this decision, 
the FAC  considered that the operating risks to the Secretariat from the reduction in 
cash reserves were limited and could be managed.  
The FAC also shifted the recruitment expenses assigned to the 2020 budget to the 
indicative 2022 budget to partially reflect the Executive Secretary’s contract 
extension. 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission approve the 2020 General 
Budget as set out in Annex B to this document.  
 
Indicative budgets for 2021 and 2022 
The FAC was also asked to consider indicative budgets for the two years beyond the 
upcoming budget.  Members of the FAC examined the indicative budgets and 
diligently looked for potential savings that could be made. 
The Executive Secretary also noted that there are some financial risks associated with 
the current in-kind contribution from CSIRO towards gene tagging.  Those in-kind 
contributions may decrease in future years as the work becomes a monitoring exercise 
rather than development of a new methodology.  
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission note the proposed changes to 
the indicative 2021 and 2022 budgets.

Terms of Reference for the 2020 Quality Assurance Review of the European Union (EU) 
for the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna  
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) is an 
intergovernmental organisation responsible for the management of southern bluefin tuna 
throughout its distribution.  Members of the Extended Commission (EC) comprise: Australia, 
the European Union (EU), the Fishing Entity of Taiwan, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, 
New Zealand and South Africa. 
 
The CCSBT's objective is to ensure, through appropriate management, the conservation and 
optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna.   
 
The purpose of the CCSBT’s Quality Assurance Review (QAR) process is to provide an 
independent review to assist Members to identify how well their management systems 
function with respect to their CCSBT obligations and to provide recommendations on areas 
where improvement may be needed.   
 
EU – Background Information 
The EU is a Regional Economic Integration Organisation (REIO) comprising 28 Member 
States.  While EU Member States transferred their competences on fisheries to the EU, 
Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) capabilities generally remain the responsibility 
of the specific EU Member State. 
 
The EU has a very specific profile as Member of the CCSBT Extended Commission. Unlike 
other CCSBT Members, the EU does not have a SBT fisheries. It does prohibit its vessels to 
target SBT and, the limited EU SBT quota (11t) is permitted exclusively for bycatch1. In this 
regard, the most recently recorded SBT bycatches were in 2012 (4.4 tonnes). 
 
The EU has also a negligible trade in SBT. 
 
There is no specific department dealing with SBT in the EU or its Member States. Instead, 
the EU has dedicated human and administrative resources to other tuna RFMOs in areas 
where SBT could potentially be by-caught. The assessment of the EU management of those 
RFMO’s fisheries does not fall within the remit of the CCSBT. 
 
 
2. SCOPE 
This QAR will review the suitability of the EU’s systems and processes for ensuring 
compliance with the following two key CCSBT measures: 
i) National allocations (i.e., by-catch of SBT); and  
 
1 Council Regulation (EU) 2019/124 of 30 January 2019 fixing for 2019 the fishing opportunities for certain fish 
stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Union waters and, for Union fishing vessels, in certain non-Union 
waters. . 
 
ii) The Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS). 
 
In particular, this QAR will determine whether the EU’s systems and processes meet 
CCSBT’s minimum performance requirements2 with respect to these two measures.  
 
The consultation is to take place with the European Commission Directorate-General for 
Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. 
 
In assessing the suitability of systems, the QAR will take into account the particular 
circumstances and characteristics of the EU (i.e., absence of a SBT fisheries) and will provide 
a high-level review of the EU’s MCS systems on the following two areas: 
i) Distant Water Bycatch Fishery – emphasis will be placed on the systems and 
processes in place for the accurate reporting and verification of any bycatch and 
discards, as well as for recording and verifying any landings of SBT; and  
ii) Market State – emphasis will be placed on the systems and processes in place to 
support requirements for the importation of SBT products including effective 
implementation of CDS requirements. 
 
 
3. LANGUAGE 
The review will be conducted in English. 
 
 
4. REVIEW PROCESS 
 
Desktop Review 
The purpose of this QAR is to independently document and evaluate whether the EU’s 
systems and processes, and taking into account that the EU has no SBT fisheries and the 
other elements mentioned in the background information, meet the relevant minimum 
performance requirements of CCSBT’s measures.  
The reviewer must evaluate the EU’s current MCS systems and processes with respect to the 
two key measures identified, and assess the following matters: 
• What systems and supporting processes are in place for ensuring: 
o Compliance with the EU’s national allocation of the SBT Total Allowable 
Catch (TAC), in particular with respect to attributing mortalities from any 
SBT bycatch and discards, and for recording and verifying any catches any 
landings of SBT; and  
o The requirements for the importation of SBT products including effective 
implementation of the CDS are met?  
 
It is expected that the review will involve the following general steps: 
1) Analysis of existing documentation, in particular the most recent National Report 
submitted to the CCSBT by the EU; 
2) Determination of whether the EU’s selected pertinent internal documentation 
adequately describes and reflects the relevant CCSBT systems and processes that are 
actually in place? 
 
2 These can be found on the CCSBT website 
3) Verification of the existence of relevant EU data capture and information documents 
including: 
o Documents to provide information on processes for the appropriate 
implementation of CCSBT’s CDS including for receipt of imports, 
submission, validation and certification requirements and the use of CCSBT 
tags;  
o Documents to record any SBT bycatch and discards at sea, including 
information on observers’ responsibilities; and 
o Documents to record any SBT landings, exports, imports, CDS tags issued and 
CDS validators authorised (if required).  
4) Determination of whether existing systems and processes are effective to ensure that 
the EU meets its CCSBT obligations?  
 
Following the above steps the reviewer should: 
 
• Undertake a SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities, threat/risk) analysis; 
• Develop recommendations including whether there is any possible further 
improvement of the EU’s compliance systems and processes, taking into account the 
results of the assessments listed above; and 
• Prepare a draft report. 
 
5. QAR REPORT 
The report should describe the findings of the review of the EU’s systems, analysis of the 
suitability of the systems and recommendations for improvements.  
The following process and timeline should be followed in preparing the QAR report3: 
• The reviewer will provide the draft report to the EU by xxxx4; 
• The EU may seek clarification from the reviewer concerning the draft report and may 
provide comments to the reviewer on any aspect of the draft report, particularly in 
relation to factual errors and omissions.  The EU’s comments should be provided to 
the reviewer within 8 weeks of receiving the draft report and no later than xxxx; 
• The reviewer will correct any factual errors reported by the EU.  The reviewer will 
also consider other comments provided by the EU and make modifications to the 
report as the reviewer considers appropriate;   
• The reviewer will provide the finalised report to the EU and to the CCSBT Executive 
Secretary no later than six weeks before the commencement of the Compliance 
Committee meeting.  The table of contents of the finalised individual QAR Report 
will include provision for an attachment at the end of the report to be provided by the 
Eu containing comments it wishes to make in relation to the outcomes of the QAR; 
and 
• The Secretariat will provide a feedback form in relation to the reviewer’s performance 
to Members. 
 
 
3 These timeframes are necessary in order for the finalised individual QAR Reports to be commented on and distributed in 
time for consideration by the Annual Meeting of the CCSBT Compliance Committee. 
4 It should be re-iterated that the QAR is intended to be for the benefit of the Member and that discussion and feedback 
between the Member and reviewer during the review period is encouraged.  Consequently, the Member should be aware of 
any significant outcomes before receiving the draft report. 
6. CONFIDENTIALITY, DATA PROTECTION, COPYRIGHT and 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) 
In carrying out this review the reviewer will have access to confidential and commercially 
sensitive information. 
With the exception of the final QAR report, all information and material obtained or 
produced by the reviewer during the course of conducting a QAR is confidential between the 
reviewer and the EU and shall not be released by the reviewer to any other party either during 
or after conducting the QARs.  The reviewer will be required to make a declaration to this 
effect. 
 
The final QAR report will be subject to the CCSBT confidentiality requirements for 
documents submitted to a meeting of a subsidiary or advisory body of the Commission as 
described in Rule 105 of the CCSBT’s Rules of Procedure.   
 
Where the QAR auditors would come into contact with personal data it is necessary to refer 
to the full applicability of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing 
of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free 
movement of such data. Under this regulation, protected personal data is transferable outside 
of the EU under exceptional circumstances and only if the third country or the international 
organisation provides appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable data subject 
rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available. 
 
7. QUALIFICATIONS OF REVIEWER 
The reviewer will be expected to have sound knowledge of fisheries management and 
fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance systems.  The reviewer will also have relevant 
experience of auditing/reviewing such systems and be independent (i.e. no conflict of 
interest) of the agencies being reviewed. 
 
The name and qualifications of the reviewer will be advised to the EU and CCSBT Members 
prior to the review taking place.   
 
8. MANAGEMENT OF QAR PROGRAMME 
The following roles and responsibilities for the effective implementation of this QAR 
programme have been identified: 
i) Executive Secretary – to manage the QAR contract; 
ii) Executive Secretary and Chair of the Compliance Committee – approve review 
methodology in consultation with the EU, provide technical advice to the reviewer 
and peer review the final overall report;  
iii) QAR Coordinator – the EU is responsible for appointing a suitably qualified official 
to coordinate the QAR activities, including providing technical support and 
advice;   
iv) Reviewer – must complete this QAR based on these Terms of Reference, the 
established methodology and the direction of the Executive Secretariat; and 
v) EU – to provide advice and access to systems, processes and information to the 
reviewer, provide the reviewer with feedback on the draft QAR Report and 
provide feedback on the performance of the reviewer to the Executive Secretary.  
 
 
Attachment 11 
 
Process for Review of external Document  
including possible non-compliances of Members 
 
In order to provide Members with an opportunity to review external papers which 
include possible non-compliances of Members prior to CCSBT meetings and to 
correct errors of fact, the following processes shall be applied: 
1. Any external papers which include possible non-compliances of Members to be 
considered by CCSBT meetings must so indicate and be received by the 
Secretariat at least 45 days prior to the meeting to which such papers are 
submitted. 
2. Such paper(s) shall be developed based on reasonable ground for believing that 
those potential non compliances have reasonable and reliable evidence without 
relying on mere speculation or anecdotal information.  
3. When a paper is received by the Secretariat it will be circulated to Members at 
least 45 days prior to the CCSBT meetings. 
4. Once the paper(s) are circulated, Members will have 20 days to consider the 
paper(s) and provide the Secretariat with their initial response to the paper(s).  
That response should consider any errors of fact, and any other matters they wish 
the meeting to be aware of. If the compliance case refers to a vessel, the vessel 
information shall not become public if a Member so requests until the EC decides 
on how to deal with it. 
5. Should Members identify errors of fact, these will need to be detailed and 
depending on the number of Members identifying errors of fact, either dealt with 
bilaterally (between that Member and the authors), or if needed, multilaterally 
with the Secretariat being the liaison point between Members and the author(s) of 
the report. The author(s) will be required to return the revised paper(s) no later 
than 15 days prior to the meeting to the Secretariat for circulation among 
Members. 
6. The revised paper(s) will be discussed at the CCSBT meetings. During 
discussions at CCSBT meetings, if a Member demonstrates that the revised 
paper(s) still contain errors of fact, and if consensus is reached, the paper(s) shall 
be withdrawn, unless those errors are corrected. 
External paper means any paper other than that submitted and endorsed by a Member, 
CNM, or the Secretariat.

Resolution on Limited Carry-forward of Unfished Annual Total Available Catch 
of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
(Revised at the Twenty Sixth Annual Meeting: 17 October 2019) 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
Noting the “Resolution on the Adoption of a Management Procedure” was adopted at 
the eighteenth annual meeting in 2011; 
Further noting that the above resolution adopted a management procedure that sets 
the global total allowable catch (TAC) for southern bluefin tuna in three year blocks; 
Considering the need for Members to effectively manage their total available catch 
within each quota year and to allow limited carry-forward of Member’s annual total 
available catch; 
Recognising that a provision to carry-forward undercatch can benefit the fishery by 
providing catch flexibility between quota years; 
Informed that such a provision will not have a negative effect on the operation of the 
current Management Procedure and the setting of global TACs; 
Mindful that this carry-forward provision may present administrative complexities for 
some Members, and that it should therefore be up to each Member whether it wishes 
to implement the provision for its vessels; 
Agrees in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8, that: 
 
Section 1: Establishment of a Carry-forward Procedure 
1.  The Extended Commission hereby establishes a procedure for limited carry 
forward of Members’ un-fished annual total available catch1. 
2.  Members shall decide whether or not to carry-forward un-fished total available 
catch. However, if a Member decides to carry-forward unfished quota, such 
carry-forward shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures defined in 
sections 2 – 4 below. 
 
1 Total available catch means a Member’s Effective Catch Limit allocation for that quota year plus any 
amount of unfished allocation carried forward to that quota year. 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 2: Carry-Forward Procedure 
3.  If a Member’s annual total available catch is under-caught, that Member may 
carry forward the unfished quota to the following quota year. However, the total 
quota carried forward from one year to the next shall not exceed 20% of that 
Member’s Effective Catch Limit2 for the year from which the quota is being 
carried forward. 
4.  A Member’s unfished annual total available catch is equal to the Member’s annual 
total available catch minus the total of all mortalities attributed to that Member for 
that quota year.  The total of all mortalities attributed to that Member shall include 
the: 
a) Mortality resulting from commercial fishing operations, whether primarily 
targeting SBT or not; and  
b) The Member’s full allowances set aside within their national allocations for: 
• Releases and/or discards; 
• Recreational fishing; 
• Customary and/or traditional fishing; and 
• Artisanal fishing. 
5.  Members shall make efforts to obtain best estimates of the actual catch amount for 
the quota year for each element outlined at paragraph 4(b) above.  If available, this 
shall be included in the total of the mortalities attributed to that Member instead of 
the Member’s full allowance. 
6.  A Member’s total available catch for a quota year shall not exceed the sum of its 
national allocation for that year plus an amount equal to 20% of its national 
allocation for the previous quota year. 
Section 3: Notification and Reporting of Carry-Forward Procedure 
7.  The Secretariat shall seek confirmation from Members at the end of the quota 
year as to whether they intend to carry forward unfished quota to the next quota 
year. Members that have elected to carry forward unfished quota shall provide 
 
2 This is the Member’s allocation plus any adjustments for agreed short term changes to the National  
Allocation. 
 
 
 
 
 
confirmation to the Secretariat within 90 days of receipt of the request and shall 
include a revised total available catch limit for the new quota year.  
8.  Members shall report on their use of the procedure in their annual reports to the 
Extended Commission, regardless of whether the procedure was in fact used by 
the Member during that quota year.  
Section 4: Circumstances When Carry-Forward Is Not Applicable 
9.  If, on the basis of advice from the Extended Scientific Committee that 
exceptional circumstances exist that necessitate additional management action, 
the Extended Commission agrees to reduce the global total allowable catch within 
a three year quota block, the carry-forward procedures provided in this resolution 
shall not be applied by any Member. 
10.  If the Extended Commission agrees within a three year quota block to reduce the 
national allocation of one or more Members, that Member or those members shall 
not apply the carry- forward procedures provided in this resolution unless decided 
otherwise by the Extended Commission taking into account the circumstances of 
the reduction. 
11.  If either the Management Procedure recommends, or the Extended Commission 
decides on a lower Global TAC, then the carry-forward procedures provided for 
in this Resolution shall not be applied by any Member unless decided otherwise 
by the Extended Commission. 
12.  If a Member exceeds its national allocation for the 2017 fishing season or later 
without paying back its excess catch for those seasons, the carry-forward 
procedures provided in this resolution shall not be applied by that Member until 
those catches have been paid back, unless otherwise agreed by the Extended 
Commission. 
Section 5: General Provisions 
13.  The procedures in this Resolution shall take effect immediately upon adoption. 
14.  Following the adoption of a new Management Procedure the Extended 
Commission shall review and amend, if necessary, this Resolution taking into 
account the advice of the Extended Scientific Committee.  
 
 
 
 
 
15. This Resolution replaces and supersedes the “Resolution on Limited Carry-
forward of Unfished Annual Total Allowable Catch of Southern Bluefin Tuna” 
that was adopted at the Twenty-First Annual Meeting. 
 
Attachment 14 
 
Resolution on the Adoption of a Management Procedure 
(updated at the Twenty Sixth Annual Meeting – 14-17 October 2019) 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
 
Seized by the need to ensure the conservation and optimum utilisation of southern 
bluefin tuna based on the best available scientific advice, 
 
Taking account of the current status of the stock and, in particular, the most recent 
stock assessment from the Extended Scientific Committee advising that the spawning 
stock biomass for 2016 was between 11% and 17% of the original spawning stock 
biomass and there are indications from the 2019 Extended Scientific Committee that 
the stock continues to rebuild,  
 
Determined to rebuild the status of spawning stock to an interim rebuilding target 
reference point of 20% of the original spawning stock biomass by 2035, 
 
Noting that the CCSBT’s original management procedure presided over the rebuilding 
of the stock from approximately 5% in 2010 of the original spawning biomass to 
approximately 13% in 2016 and that there are indications that the stock reached 
approximately 17% of the original spawning biomass in 2018, 
 
Targeting to further rebuild the stock to 30% of the original spawning biomass by 
2035, 
 
Taking account of the management procedure developed by the Extended Scientific 
Committee at its annual meeting in September 2019, 
 
Further to the Resolution on the Allocation of the Global Total Allowable Catch 
updated by the Extended Commission at its annual meeting in 2017, 
 
Recognising the obligations of each Member and Co-operating Non-Member to take 
the necessary steps to ensure that the level of its catch complies with its national 
allocation and to give effect to the Resolutions adopted by the Extended Commission, 
 
In accordance with paragraph 3(a) of Article 8 of the Convention for the Conservation 
of Southern Bluefin Tuna, the Extended Commission decides as follows: 
 
1. The Extended Commission adopts the Management Procedure (MP), to be 
known as the ‘Cape Town Procedure’, recommended by the Extended 
Scientific Committee at its annual meeting in 2019 and incorporating the 
meta-rule process described in Attachment 10 of the 18th Report of the 
Scientific Committee, incorporating the Extended Scientific Committee. The 
meta-rule process will be tailored for the Cape Town Procedure by the 
Extended Scientific Committee and will take effect once it has been endorsed 
by the EC. 
 
 
2. The MP shall be used to guide the setting of the global total allowable catch 
(TAC) for 2021 and beyond. 
 
3. The MP will recommend the TAC for 2021-2023 inclusive (i.e. no lag), but 
after that, there will be a one-year lag between TAC calculation by the MP and 
implementation of that TAC (i.e. the 2024-2026 TAC would be calculated in 
2022). 
 
4. The parameters of the MP shall be as follows: 
 
(i) 
The MP shall have at least a 70% probability of rebuilding the stock to 
an interim building target reference point of 20% of the original 
spawning stock biomass by 2035; 
 
(ii) 
The MP shall have a 50% probability of achieving a biomass level of 
30% of the original spawning stock biomass by 2035; 
 
(iii) 
The minimum increase or decrease TAC change shall be 100 tonnes; 
 
(iv) 
The maximum increase or decrease TAC change shall be 3000 tonnes; 
and 
 
(v) 
The TAC shall be set for three-year periods. 
 
5. The national allocation of the TAC within each three-year period will be 
apportioned according to the Resolution on the Allocation of the Global Total 
Allowable Catch1.

Resolution to Align CCSBT’s Ecologically Related Species measures 
with those of other tuna RFMOs 
(Adopted at the Twenty Sixth Annual Meeting – 14-17 October 2019) 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Recalling the decision made at the 5th Strategy and Fisheries Management Working 
Group Meeting to develop a binding Ecological Related Species (ERS) measure for 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) Members 
without duplicating the effort of other tuna RFMOs by creating a CCSBT Resolution 
that requires CCSBT Members to follow the ERS measures of other relevant tuna 
RFMOs, 
 
Noting the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation 
and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the 
need to cooperate and ensure consistency between conservation and management 
measures in the different tuna regional fisheries management organisations, 
 
Concerned that some seabird species, notably some albatrosses and petrels, are 
threatened with global extinction, 
 
Mindful that fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna can also cause incidental harm to other 
species such as sea turtles, sharks and cetaceans, 
 
Further recalling the requirement in Article 5(2) of the Convention for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna that the Parties shall expeditiously provide to 
the CCSBT data on, inter alia, ecologically related species, 
 
Determined to mitigate incidental harm to ecologically related species caused by fishing 
for Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Noting the importance of harmonising conservation and management measures with 
other organisations responsible for managing international fisheries, as agreed at the 
Kobe Meeting of Joint Tuna RFMOs on 26 January 2007, 
 
Reaffirming the recommendation at the seventh meeting of the Ecologically Related 
Species Working Group (ERSWG) held in Tokyo from 3 to 6 July 2007, that Members 
and Cooperating Non-Members will provide national reports on their interactions with 
ecologically related species in Southern Bluefin Tuna fisheries to the ERSWG, 
Agrees in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8, that: 
 
1. For the purposes of this CCSBT Resolution: 
a) the ‘Area of Competence of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission’ is that 
described in Article 2 of the Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian 
Ocean Tuna Commission;  
b) the ‘Convention Area of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 
Commission’ is that described in Article 3 of the Convention on the 
Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western 
and Central Pacific Ocean;  
c) the ‘Convention Area of the International Commission for the Conservation of 
Atlantic Tunas’ is that described in Article 1 of the International Convention 
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas;  
d) An Area defined in paragraphs a) – c) above is an “Area of Competence” and 
are collectively the “Areas of Competence”;  
e) ‘ERS Measures’ mean all measures relating to ecologically related species in 
force in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), the Western and Central 
Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the International Commission for the 
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), as adopted and amended from time 
to time, as contained in Annex I; 
f) Member or Cooperating Non-Member means a Member or Cooperating Non-
Member of the Extended Commission of the CCSBT. 
 
2. This Resolution shall apply to all vessels on the ‘CCSBT Record of fishing vessels 
authorised to fish for Southern Bluefin Tuna’ in the Areas of Competence. Each 
Member and Cooperating Non-Member shall ensure that such vessels flying its flag 
and fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area of Competence comply with all 
ERS Measures in force in that Area of Competence (whether or not the Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member is a member of the tuna RFMO in which the ERS 
Measures were adopted). 
 
3. When fishing outside Areas of Competence, Members and Cooperating Non-
Members shall use Tori lines in all long-line SBT fisheries below 30 degrees south. 
 
4. Where Areas of Competence overlap, Members and Cooperating Non-Members 
shall elect which applicable RFMO’s ERS Measures to apply.  
 
5. Each Member and Cooperating Non-Member shall ensure that effective action is 
taken in response to a vessel flying its flag that fails to comply with the obligations 
contained in the ERS Measures when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area 
of Competence. If a Member or Cooperating Non-Member of the Extended 
Commission undertakes fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area of 
Competence of a Convention of which it is not a Member, that Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member shall report, if any, such actions relating to the relevant 
ERS Measures to the Compliance Committee of the CCSBT, unless the compliance 
of that Member or Cooperating Non-Member with such ERS measures is assessed 
in the appropriate body of that Convention.  
 
6. The CCSBT secretariat will annually update the list of ERS Measures contained in 
Annex I before the CCSBT Extended Commission Meeting according to any 
decisions taken on ecologically related species at the Annual Meetings of the IOTC, 
WCPFC, and ICCAT. 
 
7. Except in the case of WCPFC, Members and Cooperating Non-Members that have 
formally objected to an ERS Measure in the relevant tuna RFMO, and who, by 
reason of that formal objection and the operation of the tuna RFMO’s decision-
making rules, are not bound by that ERS Measure, are exempted from applying that 
ERS Measure when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in the applicable Area of 
Competence. In the case of WCPFC, Members and Cooperating Members that have 
sought a review of a decision on an ERS measure in accordance with Article 20, 
paragraph 6 of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly 
Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean are exempted from 
applying that ERS Measure when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in the 
applicable Area of Competence until the Measure becomes binding. 
 
8. The Secretariat shall annually present a report to the CCSBT Compliance 
Committee on the implementation of the ERS Measures, for the sole purpose of the 
provision of information for Members and Cooperating Non-Members.

Recommendation to Mitigate the Impact on Ecologically Related Species of 
Fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna 
(Updated at the Twenty Sixth Annual Meeting – 14-17 October 2019) 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Concerned that some seabird species, notably albatrosses and petrels, are threatened 
with global extinction, 
 
Mindful that fishing for southern bluefin tuna can also cause incidental harm to other 
species such as sea turtles and sharks, 
 
Recalling the definition of ecologically related species in Article 2 of the Convention 
for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Further recalling the requirement in Article 5(2) of the Convention for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna that the Parties shall expeditiously provide to 
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna data on, inter alia, 
ecologically related species. 
 
Determined to mitigate incidental harm to ecologically related species caused by 
fishing for southern bluefin tuna, 
 
Noting the importance of harmonising conservation and management measures with 
other organisations responsible for managing international fisheries, as agreed at the 
Kobe Meeting of Joint Tuna RFMOs on 26 January 2007, 
 
Reaffirming the recommendation at the seventh meeting of the Ecologically Related 
Species Working Group (ERSWG) held in Tokyo from 3 to 6 July 2007, that 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members will provide national reports on their 
interactions with ecologically related species in southern bluefin tuna fisheries to the 
ERSWG, 
Recommends that: 
 
1. 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members will, to the extent possible, implement 
the International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catches of Seabirds in 
Longline Fisheries (IPOA-Seabirds), the International Plan of Action for the 
Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA-Sharks), and the FAO Guidelines to 
reduce sea turtle mortality in fishing operations (FAO-Sea turtles), if they have not 
already done so. 
2.   Members and Cooperating Non-Members will collect and report data on 
ecologically related species to the Extended Commission and/or its subsidiary bodies 
as appropriate, including the Ecologically Related Species Working Group.   
3.   Members and Cooperating Non-Members will report annually to the 
Compliance Committee of the Extended Commission on the action they have taken 
pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this recommendation. 
4.  
The Secretariat of the CCSBT is authorised to collect and exchange relevant 
data concerning ecologically related species with the Secretariat of the Indian Ocean 
Tuna Commission, the Secretariat of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 
Commission and the Secretariat of the International Commission for the Conservation 
of Atlantic Tunas. 
5.  
The Extended Commission will review the operation of this Recommendation 
and the “Resolution to Align CCSBT Ecologically Related Species measures with 
those of other tuna RFMOs” with a view to enhancing the protection of ecologically 
related species from the impacts of fishing for southern bluefin tuna. 
6.  
The Extended Commission and/or its subsidiary bodies as appropriate will 
undertake an assessment of the risks to ecologically related species posed by fishing 
for southern bluefin tuna.  The Extended Commission will consider how these risks 
are mitigated by the adoption of the “Resolution to Align CCSBT Ecologically 
Related Species measures with those of other tuna RFMOs”, and will consider 
whether any additional measures to mitigate risk are required.  
 
Attachment 17 
 
Terms of Reference for the 2021 Performance Review of the CCSBT 
 
Composition of the Performance Review Panel 
The independent performance review panel will be comprised of between four and 
seven people as described below: 
• Between two and four experts from different Members of the Extended 
Commission (EC).  The Member experts should have extensive experience 
with the CCSBT and include a Member with distant water fisheries, a coastal 
State and a developing State. As a group, the Panel should have expertise in 
fisheries management, fisheries science, compliance and legal governance at 
the international level. 
• Two independent external internationally recognised experts with expertise, as 
a group, in the best practices for international fisheries management (including 
compliance) and fisheries science.  The external experts shall not be officers or 
officials of the CCSBT or of a CCSBT Member government at the time of 
appointment nor throughout the term of the contract to conduct the 
performance review. 
• One expert from an IOTC Member country that is not also a CCSBT Member. 
 
Chair and operation of the Performance Review Panel 
• The Chair of the Performance Review Panel will be chosen by the EC from 
one of the independent external experts. The Chair will present the report of 
the Performance Review Panel to the annual meeting of the CCSBT. 
• It is envisaged that there will be one or two physical meetings of the Panel as 
determined by the Panel.  
• The Panel will determine its own mode of operation for conducting the 
performance review and for preparing its report. 
• The Panel may invite submissions from stakeholders in relation to the agreed 
criteria. The Secretariat will provide support to the panel by answering queries 
and providing background material requested by the Panel and assisting in the 
organisation of Panel meetings. The Executive Secretary will attend 
meeting(s) of the Panel if requested by the Chair of the Panel. 
• All work of the review panel will be conducted in English.  However, the 
Secretariat will translate the final report into both official languages of the 
CCSBT. 
 
Selection Process 
The process for selecting the panel for the performance review panel is outlined 
below: 
• Experts from Members of the EC will be nominated and elected at the annual 
meeting prior to commencement of the Performance Review (i.e. CCSBT 27). 
• The two independent external experts will be selected intersessionally, 
preferably prior to CCSBT 27.  This will involve: 
o Members providing a list of potential independent external experts, together 
with background information on those candidates, to the Secretariat; 
o The Secretariat circulating the lists of candidates, together with the 
background information on those candidates, to all Members; 
o Members ranking candidates as well as their preference for the Chair of the 
Panel and advise the Secretariat; and 
o The Secretariat contacting the suitable candidates in order of rankings and 
engaging two candidates to conduct the review.   
 
Funding 
• The participation and attendance of meetings by CCSBT Member experts will 
be funded by the relevant Member. 
• Consultancy fees, travel and associated costs of the two independent experts 
will be funded by the CCSBT. 
• Hire of any necessary meeting venue(s), equipment and catering will be 
funded by the CCSBT. 
 
Criteria for evaluating the CCSBT’s performance 
The criteria to be used to evaluate the performance of the CCSBT are at Annex A. 
The criteria are based on the Kobe criteria with modification to include relevant 
criteria from ICCAT’s 2016 Performance Review and to also exclude criteria that 
were considered to be of less relevance to the CCSBT. 
 
Resources available to the Panel 
The following resources will be provided to the Performance Review Panel: 
• The Report of the Performance Review Working Group (2008) 
• The Report of the Independent Expert (David Balton) on the Performance 
Review (2008) 
• The Performance of the CCSBT 2009-2013: Independent Review. 
• All other publicly available CCSBT meeting reports, documents and data 
requested by the Panel; and 
• Access1 to Secretariat staff, independent Chairs (including Compliance 
Committee, Extended Scientific Committee and Ecologically Related Species 
Working Group) and Members to respond to questions from the Panel. 
 
Report of the Performance Review 
The final report of the Performance Review Panel should be a concise, well-structured 
and easy to read document that: 
• Describes the process and steps taken to conduct the review (e.g. documents 
examined, individuals that were consulted etc.); 
• Presents the outcomes of the review;  
• Provides recommendations from the Panel for the CCSBT on how to improve 
its performance with respect to the review criteria; and 
• Prioritises the recommendations from the perspective of the Panel. 
 
 
1 By email, telephone, and direct person to person contact where this is practical and cost effective. 
The Chair of the Performance Review Panel will present the report to the annual 
meeting of the EC in October 2021 and respond to questions from Members 
concerning the report.  The finalised report will be published on the public area of the 
CCSBT’s website and the joint tuna RFMO website (www.tuna-org.org) after the 
annual meeting. 
 
Process for consideration and follow-up of Performance Review 
recommendations 
The EC will initially consider the recommendations of the Performance Review at its 
October 2021 meeting. At that meeting, the EC will decide whether there are any 
urgent recommendations that need early implementation. 
 
The Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) and Compliance Committee (CC) will 
consider aspects of the Performance Review report relevant to them at their 2022 
meetings. The EC meeting that year will consider their advice and provide direction to 
the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group (SFMWG) in relation to 
development of an implementation plan for the Performance Review 
recommendations. 
 
The Ecologically Related Species Working Group (ERSWG) will consider aspects of 
the Performance Review report that are relevant to it when the ERSWG next meets, 
which could be early 2023. 
 
Approximately mid 2023, the SFMWG will consider the advice from all the 
subsidiary bodies together with any direction from the EC and develop an 
implementation plan for the Performance Review recommendations. The 2023 EC 
meeting would consider and adopt an implementation plan for the recommendation of 
the Performance Review. 
 
A standing item will be placed on the agenda of future EC meetings to follow up on 
progress made against the implementation plan.
