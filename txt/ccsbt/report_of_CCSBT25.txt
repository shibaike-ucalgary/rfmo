EC/1810/04.  The meeting noted the activities of the Secretariat as reported. 
 
10. In relation to matters raised in the Report from the Secretariat, the EC agreed 
that: 
• The independent Chair of the Compliance Committee (Mr Frank Meere) 
should be reappointed for another three-year term; 
• The EC Referred consideration of proposed changes to the Financial 
Regulations with respect to the independent external auditor to the FAC; 
• The Rules of Procedure will be revised in accordance with Attachment 6 to 
allow the intersessional decision-making process to approve the release of 
meeting documents prior to the annual meeting of the EC; and 
• Meeting documents that have been declared to be publicly available at annual 
meetings of the CCSBT, will be placed on the public area of the CCSBT 
website. 
11. BirdLife International (BirdLife) withdrew its request for long-term observer 
status to meetings of the Compliance Committee (CC). BirdLife commented that 
during this agenda item, a Member reserved its position on the acceptance of 
BirdLife as a long-term observer at the CC in relation to a paper which was 
presented by BirdLife at the CC 13. This paper was presented under CC 13 
agenda item 4.3 in an attempt to add value to the Secretariat’s paper which 
described IOTC’s current transhipment observer protocols in relation to seabird 
measures. BirdLife presented this paper with the understanding that as it was 
publicly available on the IOTC website it would be acceptable to present to 
CCSBT. However, it is now apparent that there were issues presenting the paper 
at this time to CCSBT, so Birdlife asked to withdraw the paper from the CC 13 
and apologised for any inconvenience that this has caused. 
12. The meeting noted that with the withdrawal of this paper, paragraphs 51 and 52 
of the CC 13 report are no longer valid and should not be referenced in the future. 
13. There was some discussion concerning the Consolidated List of Authorised 
Vessels (CLAV) and it was noted that there had been a request at CCSBT 24 for 
information to be provided to CCSBT 25 on how the CLAV is utilised and the 
benefits of the CLAV to the CCSBT. 
14. The Executive Secretary advised the meeting that the main purpose of the CLAV 
is to make information on authorised vessels available to help fight and deter 
IUU activities. The CLAV consolidates information and reduces the human 
burden in determining which vessels have the right to fish in which areas. The 
Secretariat wrote to the Common Oceans ABNJ1 tuna project in April 2018 to 
seek information on the CLAV, but apart from a quick phone call, did not receive 
the formal response that was promised. Nevertheless, the ABNJ Tuna Project did 
advise that the main cost in maintaining the CLAV is the human cost of 
maintaining data quality and that if we are willing to let the data quality degrade 
over time, the CLAV can continue with daily automated updates for essentially 
no cost. The Executive Secretary further advised that maintaining the data quality 
of the CLAV has the important feedback effect of maintaining the data quality of 
each of the tuna RFMO authorised vessel databases and he suggest that this 
alone, is probably worth CCSBT’s share of the likely cost.  It was requested that 
                                                 
 
1 Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction. 
 
the Executive Secretary continue to seek a response from the ABNJ Tuna Project 
on the usage of the CLAV.  
15. It was noted that if CLAV maintenance is to be continued until the end of ABNJ 
project in September 2019, no further funding needs to be sought until 2020, and 
so potential funding arrangements need not be finalised until CCSBT 26.  
16. One Member queried whether a funding model based on the number of 
authorised vessels per tuna RFMO was an appropriate model.  The Secretariat 
noted that no decision had been taken on the funding model and that any 
suggestions regarding appropriate potential alternative funding models would be 
appreciated. 
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
17. Mr. Dominic Vallières from New Zealand was nominated as Chair of the Finance 
and Administration Committee (FAC).  Members nominated their participants to 
the FAC. 
18. The Executive Secretary provided a brief presentation of the draft revised budget 
for 2018 (CCSBT-EC/1810/05 (Rev.1)), and the proposed budget for 2019 and 
indicative budget for 2020 - 2021 (CCSBT-EC/1810/06).   
19. The Executive Secretary noted that the 2019 draft budget and the 2020 - 2021 
indicative budget includes funding to implement the Extended Scientific 
Committee’s three-year workplan. Detailed consideration of the two budget 
papers was referred to the Finance and Administration Committee. 
20. The FAC was convened to consider: 
• The revised budget for 2018; 
• The proposed budget for 2019; and  
• The indicative budget for 2020 - 2021. 
 
3.1. Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
21. The Chair of the FAC presented the report of the FAC, which is provided at 
Attachment 7. It includes: 
• A policy regarding the treatment of resources received free of charge and in-
kind contributions in the CCSBT’s Annual Financial Statements; 
• A revision to the CCSBT’s Financial Regulations to enable the EC to consider 
alternative auditors and potential cost savings; 
• A revised budget for 2018; 
• A budget for 2019; and  
• Indicative budgets for 2020 - 2021. 
22. The EC thanked the FAC Chair and the FAC for its hard work. 
23. The EC adopted the report of the FAC, including the policy at Annex A, the 
revision to the Financial Regulations at Annex B, the revised 2018 budget at 
 
Annex C and the budget for 2019 at Annex D.  The EC also noted the indicative 
budgets for 2020-2021 at Annex D.  
24. In response to a question, the Secretariat advised that the contributions from 
Members shown in the approved budget for 2019 at Annex D of Attachment 7 
does not include the Advance Contributions which resulted from South Africa’s 
accession in February 2016. The Advance Contributions for each Member are 
shown on page 5 of paper CCSBT-EC/1810/06. The actual amount that Members 
need to pay to the CCSBT in 2019 are their contributions as shown in Annex D 
minus the Advance Contributions shown in paper CCSBT-EC/1810/06. The 
Secretariat also advised that if Members wished to reduce fluctuations in 
contributions from year to year, they could choose to keep some of their Advance 
Contribution to offset their payments in 2020. This will be explained in the letter 
from the Secretariat that requests payment of Member contributions for 2019. 
25. Some Members were disappointed that the funding for the proposed study from 
the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) for analysis of farm and market data 
had been substantially reduced and that the project would now need to be 
conducted with less resources than proposed by the ESC. New Zealand expressed 
its frustration for delays in resolving farm and market reporting issues and 
reiterated that it would have difficulty adopting a new MP if it does not see 
progress in this matter. Japan stated that if these issues are not resolved before 
establishing a new MP, the MP should take into account such uncertainties. The 
EC agreed to a Terms of Reference for discussion on farm and market analysis at 
the 2019 ESC meeting. The Terms of Reference is provided at Attachment 8.  
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries and ERS Interactions 
26. The Chair noted the deliberations of the CC and invited Members to ask 
questions about Members’ National Reports additional to those already raised at 
the Thirteenth Meeting of the Compliance Committee (CC 13). 
27. It was requested that Australia provide an update on its stereo-video (SV) camera 
technology research, and a potential timeframe within which the remaining issues 
with this technology might be resolved. 
28. Australia confirmed that it is confident of its current sampling method but 
committed to adopting SV technology as soon as a fully automated, cost-
effective system is available, but noted that it is unlikely to deliver cost effective 
or satisfactory results without agreed appropriate standards (such as for example 
the E-monitoring standards currently being discussed by WCPFC). 
29. Some Members commented that they had not previously been informed of the 
link between having CCSBT e-monitoring standards and implementation of 
stereo video. Australia indicated that it became aware of this requirement as part 
of its continuing work on SV. Australia commented that it is important to have 
standards on the required accuracy and precision of fish measurements as these 
will have cost implications, and that it is also important to know the proportion of 
fish that should be measured and what implications there are on analyses for fish 
that cannot be measured.  
 
30. Australia committed to provide a paper to CCSBT 26 outlining the work it has 
conducted to automate SV measurements, what it has learned through this work 
and what Australia needs to overcome remaining issues, including what decisions 
need to be made by the EC (such as on data standards) in order to resolve these 
issues to enable implementation of SV. 
 
4.1. Reports on Members’ projects 
31. No reports were provided in relation to Members’ projects. 
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working 
Group 
32. Australia, as host of the Fifth Meeting of Strategy and Fisheries Management 
Working Group (SFMWG 5) presented the report of the SFMWG’s March 2018 
meeting, which is at Attachment 9. 
33. New Zealand noted that one of the issues discussed by the SFMWG was whether 
to set up rules for allocations of the TAC, particularly in relation to non-Members 
and potential new Members. New Zealand remarked that the EC should plan for 
possible approaches from non-Members to become a Member, particularly in 
light of the CC’s discussions as to the potential SBT catches of non-Members. 
34. Japan stated that allocation to potential new Members should take into account 
how much allocation those Members request vis-a-vis how much allocation 
existing Members have and that it would be easier for Members to consider such 
allocation when that TAC is increased. 
35. The EC approved the report of SFMWG and noted its recommendations.  
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
36. The independent Chair of the Compliance Committee, Mr Frank Meere, 
presented the report of CC 13 which is provided at Attachment 10. 
37. The CC Chair highlighted the report’s workplan (paragraph 111), 
recommendations to the EC (paragraph 115) and notes for the EC (paragraph 
116), and thanked participants for a productive meeting. 
38. The EC adopted CC 13’s report and recommendations, noting that some items 
needed to be discussed further, these being: 
• Some Members expressed concerns regarding whether the Global Trade Atlas 
(GTA) could be considered an official information source of trade data and 
requested that the Secretariat investigate alternative sources of trade data 
statistics; 
• The EU advised that it has not had any catch of SBT for the past 4-5 years and 
that it is in a very complex situation as it has a large number of Member 
States.  Therefore, the EU has concerns about the opportunity to undertake the 
QAR in the EU and if currently proposed QAR options will be representative 
 
and produce meaningful conclusions.  The EU will provide more information 
intersessionally during 2019 so that an informed decision can be made on the 
EU QAR; 
• Taiwan commented that while it was positive towards encouraging new 
Members to join the CCSBT, care should be taken to ensure that the 
acceptance of any new Members does not affect the rights of existing 
Members; in addition, that any new Members should confirm their 
commitment to abide by CCSBT’s Convention and its Resolutions and 
Conservation and Management Measures (CMMs) before joining; 
• It was noted that the proposal (for enhancing the implementation of ERS 
measures through outreach/education and verifying compliance with 
measures) to be developed collaboratively between the Secretariat, BirdLife 
and Members, would need to be agreed by Members before it could proceed; 
and 
• One Member noted that while CC 13 had not identified any non-compliance 
issues requiring corrective actions under the Corrective Actions Policy, some 
issues of non-compliance had been identified and Members should work to 
correct these deficiencies, for example, in the reporting of attributable catch. 
39. The EC approved the CC 13’s report and noted its recommendations.  
40. In addition:  
• The EC agreed a Terms of reference for an annual Technical Compliance 
Working Group meeting which is provided at Attachment 11; and 
• New Zealand offered to lead an intersessional process to re-develop and refine 
the current CC/EC annual reporting template for the consideration of CCSBT 
26. One Member noted that if any new reporting obligations were added to 
this template, then some of the existing obligations should be removed so as 
not to increase the burden to Members.  
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
41. The independent Chair of the Extended Scientific Committee, Dr Kevin Stokes, 
presented the report of the ESC meeting which is summarised in papers CCSBT-
EC/1810/10 and CCSBT-EC/1810/18. The full ESC Report is at Attachment 12.    
42. The Humane Society International (HSI) asked the ESC Chair several questions 
on the nature of the advice from ESC including concern of possible evidence of 
overfishing from the lengths of fish on spawning grounds, how the ESC accounts 
for non-Member and illegal fishing, whether the ESC was constraining its focus 
too tightly on achieving 0.30 or 0.35 of unexploited biomass by 2035, and 
whether the risks of climate change have been considered by the ESC. In 
response to these questions, the ESC Chair advised that: 
• He did not see evidence of over-fishing from the lengths of fish in the 
spawning grounds and that the lengths could be interpreted in many ways, 
including in a positive manner due to the appearance of more smaller fish 
coming through, but noting that this could also be a sampling issue; 
 
• The ESC would like the best possible data on removals but has to deal with the 
information that it has. The Management Procedure (MP) has robustness trials 
to deal with uncertainties in unaccounted mortalities;  
• Given the current Operating Model (OM) and starting conditions, the focus 
has been on CMPs that meet the SFMWG guidance, but in 2019 the OM will 
be updated and wider targets may be considered; and 
• There is no direct consideration of climate change, but the MP considers a 
wide range of productivity as part of the robustness process, and the meta-
rules and exceptional circumstances procedures allow for situations out of the 
scope of what is tested. 
43. The meeting discussed what guidance to give the developers of the MP on the 
specifications and the desired behaviour for the new MP, including timeframes to 
reach target spawning stock biomass levels. It was agreed to maintain the 
guidance given by the March 2018 SFMWG meeting but allow developers the 
flexibility to explore and report on different scenarios where appropriate and 
feasible. It was noted that the Operating Model (OM) will be updated with new 
data in 2019 and that as a result, scenarios that exhibited undesirable behaviour in 
this year’s trials (such as large TAC decreases or fluctuations in TACs) might 
have slightly different behaviour with the updated OM and could potentially be 
reconsidered. It was further agreed to add a new performance statistic for each 
Candidate Management Procedure (CMP) showing the probability of reaching 
30% of the unfished spawning biomass by 2030. 
44. Extensive discussions were held on the proposal from the ESC for independent 
panels to determine a methodology for resolving issues regarding the possible 
Australian farm and Japanese market anomalies that have been unresolved for 
many years and whether the proposal is likely to be effective in resolving the 
issues in these areas. Members generally agreed that the effectiveness was not 
able to be determined before the studies were done, but some believed it was a 
step forward towards resolution of the issues. Some Members thought the cost 
was too high to justify, but others were accepting of the proposal if it was the 
only solution and if costs could be reduced. During discussions, Australia 
clarified that its CDS data are confidential and could not commit to providing 
these data to a third party for analysis until the methodology is provided and 
Australia can evaluate whether the methodology would be able to provide a 
definitive result.  
45. It was commented that the farm methodology survey would not be necessary if 
stereo video monitoring was implemented by Australia, which Australia is still 
investigating in terms of automation, cost-effectiveness and other issues. The EU 
offered to provide information on stereo video monitoring of bluefin that has 
been used by ICCAT, which the EU stated was an accurate, efficient and proven 
technology. Australia advised that it was happy to have discussions with the EU 
on this but noted that operations in Australia were different to those in the 
Mediterranean and it was not necessarily straightforward to transfer the 
technology. 
46. The meeting also discussed potential non-Member catches. It was agreed that 
non-Member catches were a concern and needed to be better estimated, but that 
they were difficult to estimate, especially without fine-scale data. Suggestions 
included: using WCPFC and IOTC data to obtain estimates as done in a previous 
 
study and pursuing an MoU with IOTC for an exchange of data similar to the 
MoU with the WCPFC. Japan noted that provision of fine scale data could be 
made only for stock assessment on a case by case basis. No agreement was 
reached, but it was noted that there was an agenda item at ESC for this issue and 
that papers would be required from Members on the potential types of non-
Member catches and how to estimate them.  
47. The meeting discussed that examining markets was one method that could be 
used to identify the potential for unaccounted mortalities. The results of the 
TRAFFIC market survey of China was an example where some SBT catch has 
not been appropriately accounted for. The meeting noted that market surveys 
need to be carefully designed to avoid uncertainty in the conclusions (for 
example CCSBT is yet to resolve whether there are uncertainties associated with 
the Japan Market survey). One Member stated that improved fisheries monitoring 
would reduce potential reliance on market survey to identify unaccounted 
mortalities. 
48. One Member stated that while non-Member catches were a problem, 
underestimation of Members catches was potentially a larger problem. Another 
Member stated that unless the problem of under-reporting of Member catches 
was resolved it would have difficulty in agreeing to a new MP. It was clarified 
that the OMs already account for uncertainty in Member catches and that the 
overall TAC recommendation should be robust to such uncertainty. However, 
this is also a potential problem as Members not involved could have their 
allocation of the TAC adversely impacted by this approach. 
49. The EC approved the report of ESC 23 and noted the recommendations of the 
ESC.  
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
8.1. Attributable SBT Catch 
50. The Chair commented that the EC has agreed that full implementation of the 
Attributable SBT Catch commences from the 2018 season and opened the floor 
to discussion on how each Member has accounted for its SBT mortalities.  
51. Australia reported that its logbook information had improved since the 
implementation of electronic monitoring and asked other Members how they 
were able to reconcile differences in discards between logbook and observer data, 
particularly given that observer coverage rates were low. In response to this 
question: 
• Japan commented that there were no discrepancies between the Real Time 
Monitoring Program (RTMP) data and observer data for its fleet; 
• Korea explained that it uses observer data to estimate its discard mortality, that 
its vessels were obliged to record discards in logbooks and it cross-checks this 
against observer data; and 
• Taiwan stated that it uses daily logbook data and observer data and believes it 
can provide accurate data. Taiwan has been experimenting with electronic 
monitoring but is at the early stages and is not implemented for the SBT fleet. 
 
52. Australia advised that the introduction of electronic monitoring had shown 
discrepancies that weren’t evident in historical data and encouraged Members to 
continue to explore ways to validate their data. It stated that electronic 
monitoring is an effective approach and encouraged Members to consider 
implementing electronic monitoring in the future.  
53. Australia explained that its policy has always been to discourage discards and 
only to allow the discarding of live and vigorous fish, with penalties if discarding 
is detected for fish not in that state. 
54. In response to questions about its recreational fishery mortality estimates, New 
Zealand responded that: 
• Its recreational estimates included both charter vessel catch and catch from the 
general population. 
• Charter vessels are required to report SBT, while other catches have been 
estimated from ramp-based surveys and game-fishing records. 
• The option of a 40t allowance for recreational fishers was provided by the 
recreational sector as a basis for consultation. The provisional estimates for the 
most recent season is 12t. New Zealand is concerned about potential catch and 
is considering imposing bag and/or boat limits. As an outcome of this 
consultation, there is currently a domestic catch allowance of 20t for this 
sector. 
 
8.2. TAC Determination 
55. At CCSBT 23, the EC agreed to set the TAC for 2018-2020 at 17,647 tonnes per 
year in accordance with the recommendation from the CCSBT’s Management 
Procedure (MP). 
56. The EC confirmed there were no exceptional circumstances that required the 
2019 TAC to be revised, and the TAC for 2019 was confirmed to remain at 
17,647t. 
 
8.3. Research Mortality Allowance 
57. The Chair advised the meeting that the ESC had endorsed a total Research 
Mortality Allowance (RMA) of 4.0t to be set aside for 2019 as follows: 
• 3.0 t for the CCSBT Gene Tagging Project; and 
• 1.0 t to Japan for trolling surveys of juvenile SBT in Western Australia. 
58. The EC approved these RMA requests. 
 
8.4. Allocation of TAC 
59. The Chair advised that allocations and effective catch limits to Members for 
2018-2020 were agreed at CCSBT 23 and these allocations are provided on page 
3 of paper CCSBT-EC/1810/11 and are repeated in Table 1 below. The EC 
confirmed that the allocations for 2019 would be as agreed at CCSBT 23. 
 
 
Table 1:  Allocations (tonnes of SBT) to Members for 2018-2020. Japan is providing a voluntary 
transfer of 21t to Indonesia and 27t to South Africa for the 2018 to 2020 quota block.  This transfer is 
included in column “(3)” of Table 1.  6,165 will be Japan’s starting point in considering the allocation 
from 2021.

Agenda Item 9. 
CCSBT Strategic Plan 
60. The Secretariat presented paper CCSBT-EC/1810/12 which provides background 
information on the current CCSBT Strategic Plan and its five-year Action Plan.  
Discussions focused on five action items specified for 2018 or for 2019 that 
require initial discussion at EC 25. 
Undertake Commission performance reviews periodically to routinely assess 
opportunities for improvements, including both self-assessment and independent 
reviews 
61. The EC noted that if the next performance review is conducted during 2019, the 
new MP will not be in place, the new management objectives for the fishery will 
not be available and the last stock assessment will be two years old. Conversely, 
if the performance review was conducted in 2021, the new MP will be in place 
with the new management objectives, and an up-to-date stock assessment will 
have been conducted in 2020. Furthermore, the UNSFA Informal Consultations 
to be held in 2019 will be focusing on performance reviews of RFMOs, so it may 
be prudent to hold off the performance review until the outcomes of those 
consultations are known. 
62. The EC agreed that the next CCSBT Performance Review should be postponed 
until 2021.  
a) Review Convention text (if Member/s propose such negotiations) and, where 
appropriate, incorporate modern fisheries management principles and/or standards 
through decisions of the Commission e.g. in reviewing Management Procedure; 
measures to manage ERS (noting the latter option may be more efficient)  
b) Develop mechanisms for extending full CCSBT Membership to Fishing Entities 
and REIOs 
63. A variety of views were expressed on the need to update the Convention text. 
Most Members considered revision of the Convention to be a low priority. One 
Member considered that there was no need to revise the Convention, while some 
other Members thought it was important to explore ways to extend full 
membership to Fishing entities and REIOs, and/or to modernise the Convention. 
 
64. It was agreed that interested Members will communicate intersessionally and 
possibly prepare a paper(s), on reflections regarding the Convention including a 
work plan on potential revisions for discussion at CCSBT 26.  
Task the SC with incorporating modern fisheries management principles and/or 
standards that have not yet been included in its work 
65. It was noted that the ESC is already required to incorporate advice consistent 
with the precautionary approach into its advice to the EC and that it incorporates 
the best scientific information available in its advice, some of which is from 
cutting edge science. 
66. The EC confirmed that it seems unnecessary to task the ESC with any further 
fisheries management principles and/or standards in relation to its work with 
southern bluefin tuna. 
Formalise the ongoing role of the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working 
Group (SFMWG), including to ensure modern fisheries management standards are 
incorporated into the Commission’s decision making.  
- Clearly define the on-going role of the SFMWG, its name, terms of reference and 
its chairing arrangements as part of the review at 7.1(vii) 
- Include provision in the terms of reference for the SFMWG for incorporating 
modern fisheries management standards into its advice to the Commission  
67. The EC agreed to a revised the Terms of Reference for the SFMWG, which are 
provided at Attachment 13. 
Investigate ways of providing for the participation and/or cooperation of a wider 
range of actors 
68. There was discussion concerning the merits of widening CCSBT’s Membership 
to potentially allow non-Member States with CCSBT authorised carrier vessels, 
and/or potentially also SBT port States and/or market States to become CNMs. In 
addition, there was extensive discussion on whether the Flag of carrier vessels 
shall be restricted only to Members and CNMs. 
69. In both cases, the EC could not agree on introducing changes. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Ecologically Related Species (ERS) 
10.1. Consideration of the CCSBT’s vision in relation to ERS 
70. Australia presented paper CCSBT-EC/1810/23 related to options for providing 
focus and direction to the work of the Ecologically Related Species Working 
Group (ERSWG). The paper proposed six recommendations that were discussed 
by the meeting.  
71. The EC reached agreement on three of the recommendations, as follows: 
• That ERS is to remain a standing item on the Annual Meeting agenda, and the 
Secretariat is to provide annual reports on Members’ performance with respect 
to ERS; 
• To convene the ERSWG on an ad hoc basis, to address specific issues 
identified by the EC; and 
 
• The Secretariat should forward the ERSWG report to the ESC and CC for their 
information.  
72. It was clarified that the report provided by the Secretariat would be a simple 
report of numbers and species by Member for the past 3 years, derived from 
Members annual reports and submitted ERS data, and did not require additional 
submission from Members.  
 
10.2. Resolution on binding ERS measures for the CCSBT 
73. New Zealand presented NZ/EU joint paper CCSBT-EC/1810/19 on a draft 
Resolution to Align CCSBT Ecologically Related Species measures with those of 
other tuna RFMOs. 
74. HSI suggested the inclusion of ACAP in the preamble and to include IATTC in 
the list of RFMOs, but these suggestions were not accepted by Members. 
75. The EC adopted the Resolution to Align CCSBT Ecologically Related Species 
measures with those of other tuna RFMOs, which is provided at Attachment 14. 
76. BirdLife and HSI expressed its disappointment that, in their view, the Resolution 
does not allow the CCSBT to consider compliance in the CC with ERS measures 
and that the Resolution is not compatible with taking corrective action. It 
commented that this is a particular problem since the CCSBT is the RFMO that 
has the greatest overlap with threatened seabird populations. 
 
10.3. Terms of Reference for the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
77. The Secretariat presented paper CCSBT-EC/1810/13 on Terms of Reference for 
the ERSWG. The EC agreed on the updated Terms of Reference for the ERSWG, 
which are provided at Attachment 15. 
78. The EC agreed that the report of the ERSWG would be provided to the ESC for 
comment, and that the ERSWG Chair would present the report to the EC 
including any comments made by the ESC. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
79. The Secretariat presented paper CCSBT-EC/1810/14 on CCSBT’s relationship 
with non-Members and advised that China, Fiji, Singapore and the United States 
had been invited to attend the meetings of the Compliance Committee and 
Extended Commission, but that Singapore and the United States attended CC 13 
only. Further, the Secretariat advised that there has been considerable interaction 
between the CCSBT Secretariat and non-Member States and other organisations 
during 2018, mostly in the compliance area. 
80. The Secretariat noted that the CCSBT had corresponded with China twice since 
CCSBT 24.  The first item of correspondence was a letter signed by the CCSBT 
Chair in December 2017 on various matters including an invitation to China to 
become a Member, Cooperating Non-Member or an observer of the CCSBT.  
The second was a letter regarding alleged IUU fishing activities by Chinese-
flagged vessels that occurred in July-August 2018. No response was received to 
 
the first letter, but a brief response was received to the second letter indicating 
that China would conduct an investigation. 
81. It was suggested that in addition to inviting China to attend CCSBT’s meetings, 
another approach might be to ask China to conduct a specific action. It was 
proposed that the Secretariat could provide a map to China setting out areas 
where SBT are expected to be caught and request that China ask its longliners not 
to fish within that area and to monitor its longliners’ positions by VMS. There 
was general support for this type of approach.  It was also noted that 
opportunities to follow-up with China during Members’ bilateral discussions 
could be helpful.  
82. The Secretariat noted that it wrote to the Philippines to inform it of CCSBT 24’s 
decision that the Philippines did not qualify to retain the status of Cooperating 
Non-Member of the CCSBT. In addition, the Secretariat acknowledged the 
USA’s continued cooperation with the CCSBT’s CDS. 
83. The EC agreed that: 
• The Secretariat should repeat its invitations to China, Fiji, Singapore, and the 
USA for CC 14 and CCSBT 26, as well as inviting Mauritius (an important 
port State) as was recommended by CC 13; and 
• The CCSBT would communicate with China, requesting that its fleet avoid 
fishing in areas likely to catch SBT and provide information as to the specific 
areas to avoid. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Kobe Process 
84. The Secretariat presented paper CCSBT-EC/1810/15 which provided an update 
on Kobe process activities. 
85. The paper noted that the Chair of the Kobe Steering Committee (KSC) provided 
a concept note for consideration by the five tuna RFMOs. This concept note 
proposes that the practical work of Kobe would be arranged into the following 
three main categories: 
• Cooperation, exchange of information and coordination within the Steering 
Committee; 
• Organisation of meetings of existing or new working groups covering 
particular topics. (e.g. MSE, FADs, by-catch, catch documentation, external 
communication, best practices in science, compliance); and 
• The organisation of a new large-scale meeting will also be considered - 
tentative timing is for September 2019.  
86. One Member noted that it was important to recognise that the BBNJ2 process is 
in progress and that RFMOs should develop a common view and understanding 
on what’s happening in this area. 
                                                 
 
2 Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction 
 
87. With regard to the three categories listed in the Kobe Chair’s concept note, the 
EC agreed that: 
• It supports the first activity and the Kobe process in general; 
• It supports some suggestions for themes of small technical meetings as part of 
the second activity; and 
• Some Members still have reservations about supporting a large-scale Kobe IV 
given there is not yet any information available on the proposed main themes 
for such a meeting. If Kobe IV proceeds, individual Members would make 
their own decisions on whether to attend depending on the theme. It was noted 
there were mixed views between the Members as to whether Kobe IV is likely 
to be useful. 
88. The Executive Secretary will respond to the KSC Chair noting the EC’s advice, 
including that the proposed meeting date of September is not ideal for CCSBT 
Members and that initial discussion indicated July might be a better time. A 
Member encouraged all Members to continue participating in the Kobe Process 
and promote this process in other tuna RFMOs.   
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
13.1. Reports from other RFMO meetings of interest  
89. The Chair introduced this item which is summarised in the Secretariat’s paper 
CCSBT-EC/1810/16 on activities with other organisations. 
90. The following reports were provided by Members as part of their observer duties 
for the CCSBT. 
• Korea’s report (CCSBT-EC/1810/25) on the on 14th Regular Session of the 
Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC);  
• Australia’s report (CCSBT-EC/1810/20) on the 36th Annual Meeting of the 
Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
(CCAMLR);  
• Indonesia’s report (CCSBT-EC/1810/24) on the Twenty Second Session of the 
Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC);  
• Taiwan’s report (CCSBT-EC/1810/22) on the 2018 (93rd) Annual Meeting of 
the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC); and  
• Japan’s report (CCSBT-EC/1810/21) on the 25th Regular Meeting of 
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).  
91. It was agreed that the following Members would act as Observers to other 
RFMOs on behalf of CCSBT during 2018/19: 
• Korea to continue as an Observer to WCPFC; 
• Australia to continue as an Observer to CCAMLR; 
• Indonesia to continue as Observer to IOTC; 
• Japan to continue as an Observer to ICCAT; and 
• Taiwan to continue as an Observer to IATTC. 
 
 
13.2. Review of the “Arrangement” with CCAMLR  
92. The Secretariat presented Section 2 of paper CCSBT-EC/1810/16 on the current 
Arrangement between CCSBT and CCAMLR. This Arrangement is now due for 
review and a decision is required from both Commissions regarding whether it 
will be renewed. The Secretariat confirmed that it considers that the current 
Arrangement is suitable as an overarching agreement and that it would be 
acceptable to renew the arrangement in its current form. 
93. Members asked about the status of the proposed implementation plan to facilitate 
enhanced cooperation, as well as the reciprocal meeting invitation arrangements. 
It was confirmed that the implementation plan is in only the very early stages of 
discussion. In addition, that while reciprocal meeting invitation arrangements are 
in place, the Executive Secretary has not attended any CCAMLR meetings.  
Instead, Australia participates at CCAMLR as the observer from CCSBT. A 
CCAMLR scientific officer has attended one CCSBT ERSWG meeting.  
94. The EC agreed to renew the Arrangement between the CCSBT and CCAMLR, 
which is provided at Attachment 16. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Confidentiality of Data and Documents 
14.1.   Confidentiality of reports and documents from 2018 
95. The Chair introduced paper CCSBT-EC/1810/17 (Rev.2) on the confidentiality 
of reports and documents submitted as meeting documents during 2018.   
96. The meeting noted that all the reports of meetings and documents submitted to 
meetings under the jurisdiction of CCSBT 25 would be made publicly available 
with the following exceptions: 
• Attachment A of this paper (CCSBT-ESC/1809/04);  
• Paper CCSBT-ESC/1809/16 and CCSBT-CC/1810/BGD04 from Australia 
titled “Japan Market Update 2018”; 
• Papers CCSBT-ESC/1809/30 and CCSBT-CC/1810/BGD02 from Japan titled 
“Monitoring of Southern Bluefin Tuna trading in the Japanese domestic 
markets: 2018 update”; 
• Paper CCSBT-ESC/1809/31 from Japan titled “Summary points of market 
monitoring of southern bluefin tuna, based on Attachment 7 in report of 
ESC22”; and  
• The Secretariat’s papers CCSBT-CC/1810/20 on Potential Non-Member 
Fishing Activity & Trade/Emerging Markets and CCSBT-EC/1810/14 on 
relationships with non-Members. 
97. With the exception of the last two Secretariat papers, all of the above papers were 
classified as being confidential because they referred to information from other 
confidential documents. The Secretariat’s last two papers were classified as 
confidential because the activity of named vessels was specified in those papers 
and the Flag State is still investigating those cases. 
 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Meetings for 2019 
98. The EC discussed whether to hold the next ERSWG meeting during 2019. There 
was general support for a suggestion that the agenda should include risk 
assessments of seabirds and threat assessments of sharks as well as other items 
relating to the Terms of Reference of the ERSWG. 
99. The EC agreed that the ERSWG will be held in 2019, in Canberra, with the 
meeting dates to be determined intersessionally by the Executive Secretary. 
Initial indications suggested that a meeting date during April or May might be 
possible. 
100. It was agreed that the following meetings and dates would apply for 2019: 
• An informal Operating Model and management Procedure Technical Meeting, 
in Cape Town, South Africa, on 1 September 2019; 
• The Extended Scientific Committee meeting, in Cape Town, South Africa 
from 2 – 7 September 2019;  
• An informal Compliance Technical Working Group Meeting, in Cape Town, 
South Africa on 9 October 2019; 
• The Compliance Committee Meeting, in Cape Town, South Africa from 10 – 
12 October 2019; and   
• The Extended Commission Meeting, in Cape Town, South Africa from 14 – 
17 October 2019. 
101. The Executive Secretary will determine suitable dates for a five-day 
intersessional OMMP meeting during June 2019 after discussion with the 
scientists involved, in accordance with past practise for this meeting. 
 
Agenda Item 16. 
Election of the Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended 
Commission of the 26th Annual Meeting of the CCSBT 
102. The Chair asked Members to nominate candidates for the Chair and Vice Chair 
of the Extended Commission for CCSBT 26.  
103. No candidates were nominated, so the Chair advised that the next Chair and 
Vice-Chair will be determined in accordance with past practice and the rotation 
of meetings. Therefore, South Africa will provide the Chair of the Extended 
Commission and Japan will provide the Vice-Chair. 
104. South Africa advised that it will nominate the person to Chair the Extended 
Commission of CCSBT 26 soon after CCSBT 25.  Japan nominated Mr Shingo 
Ota to be the Vice-Chair. 
 
Agenda Item 17. 
Other Business 
17.1.   Scientific Advisory Panel 
105. The Chair advised the meeting that Professor John Pope has retired from the 
Scientific Advisory Panel and that the ESC has advised that it is important to 
replace Professor Pope with a new expert. 
 
106. The EC agreed that a replacement expert would be appointed to the panel and 
that the new expert needed to be independent and not under any potential 
influence from any Member government. 
107. The selection criteria for the replacement panel Member was agreed and is 
provided at Attachment 17.  
108. The meeting also agreed to the following selection process for the new panel 
Member: 
• Members provide nominations to the Secretariat for candidates that meet the 
Selection Criteria by the end of November this year. The nominations should 
include CVs of the candidates.  The Secretariat will then run an intersessional 
voting/selection process in a similar manner as it did for the Chair of the ESC.  
This will involve: 
o The Secretariat distributing nominees’ CVs for Members to rank in order of 
preference; 
o Secretariat tallies the ranking; 
o Successful candidate is notified; and 
o Members notified of the successful candidate.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Good morning / Bonjour. 
On behalf of the Australian delegation, I would like to begin by thanking the 
European Union and the Territory of New Caledonia for hosting this meeting. We 
appreciate the warm welcome we have received and these excellent meeting facilities. 
Thank you also to the Chair of the Extended Commission, Mr du Reitz for his 
participation, and the Secretariat for their work throughout the year, particularly in the 
lead up to these meetings.  
I would also like to thank in advance our translators who I am told often have the 
difficult task of keeping up with complex discussions, but whom we rely on so 
heavily. 
The Commission has a vital role managing southern bluefin tuna, and the fishery is of 
great importance to Australia. It is an important aspect of our work in the international 
community. I am honoured to have taken on the role of Australia’s CCSBT 
Commissioner and look forward to working with each and every one of you. I was 
impressed to learn that some delegates at this meeting have worked on these issues 
since before Commission was created. I appreciate the welcome I have already 
received and the support offered in meeting my new responsibilities.  
Australia notes the positive news that the southern bluefin tuna stock is showing some 
signs of recovery. We must remain cautious however, as the spawning stock biomass 
remains low.   
A 25th annual meeting is a great milestone for any organisation. Australia sees the 
work of the Commission over future years as building on already solid foundations, 
and consolidating and refining our management arrangements. This year we continue 
our deliberations about the nature and objective of the new Management Procedure.  
Australia considers that good progress was made at the Extended Scientific 
Committee and that the Commission is well placed to make a decision about the new 
Management Procedure this time next year. I look forward to our discussion on this 
over the next few days. Australia sees a need for the Commission to be forward-
looking and ready to engage in emerging issues. 
From our perspective this includes:  
• 
dealing with non-Member catch;  
• 
ensuring we account fully for attributable catch at a national level—and being 
transparent about the processes and assumptions we use in doing this;  
• 
responding to ecologically related species issues—including by working 
closely with other Regional Fisheries Management Organisations to minimise 
our impact on the marine environment;  
• 
striking the right balance between long-term sustainable financing and 
ensuring the Commission can continue its important work without placing an 
unsustainable burden on Members.  
Australia is committed to working constructively with all Members to achieve the best 
outcomes for CCSBT.  
Thank you.  
Attachment 4 – 2 
 
Opening Statement by the European Union 
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
On behalf of Mr. Vella, the European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and 
Fisheries, I would like to warmly welcome you in Noumea at the 25th Meeting of the 
Commission for the Conservation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna. 
I sincerely hope that you all will enjoy your stay in New Caledonia, and hope that you 
find some time, despite the substantial agenda, to enjoy the local culture and way of 
life during your stay in this beautiful island. 
The EU is very pleased to host the CCSBT Annual Meeting for the first time and in 
this occasion we would like to express our full committed to this organisation and 
desire to help strengthen CCSBT as a vital axis for tuna fisheries and contribute to the 
sustainable management of the Southern Bluefin Tuna. 
Despite being a major fishing player and fish producer, the world’s largest importer, 
in market value, of fish and fish products and one of the biggest consumers of fish, the 
EU has limited direct interests in CCSBT either in terms of catches or imports. 
Notwithstanding, we are very keen to contribute to the sound management of the 
Southern Bluefin Tuna stock and to promote good governance and coherence amongst 
tuna RFMOs, notably by supporting science and compliance in CCSBT and sharing 
here our experiences from other sister organisations. 
The European Union looks forward to benefit from the work and recommendations of 
science in general and particularly from the Scientific Committee in support to the 
adoption of conservation measures aiming at the sustainable exploitation of the 
natural resources. The EU is also strongly committed to ensuring and support 
compliance in CCSBT.  
An important matter that will be discussed this year, not yet for final decision, refers 
to the future Operating Model and Management Procedure that will be made available 
in October 2020 to determinate the TAC for the next 3 year block period (2021, 2022 
and 2023 fishing seasons). In this important framework, the EU aims at rebuilding of 
the SBT stock, as fastest as practicable, by reaching the spawning biomass level that 
would produce the Maximum Sustainable Yield and keep the level of fisheries also 
ensuring the MSY. 
We are also particularly interested in contributing to endorse the recommendations 
made by the Compliance Committee. Globally, on Monitoring, Control and 
Surveillance measures the EU aligns with the situation and experiences from other 
tuna RFMOs. 
This year one of the most important agenda points concerns the management of the 
Ecological Related Species in CCSBT fisheries. In fact, SBT fisheries have a high 
impact in ERS, particularly on endangered sea-birds. It this context, the EU support s 
the reinforcement of ERS management, notably through the Ecological Related 
Species Working Group that so far had a very limited and undefined role.  
In this same framework, we look forward the adoption of the resolution requiring 
members to apply ERS measures, relevant in other tuna RFMOs, when their vessels 
fishing SBT operate in areas overlapping with other tuna RFMO Convention's areas. 
To conclude Ladies and Gentlemen, 
I would like to invite all Contracting Parties to work together in a constructive spirit 
and towards joint objectives to make this CCSBT session a success. 
Thank you for your attention. 
Attachment 4 – 3 
 
Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen, Good 
morning. 
On behalf of Taiwan delegation, I would like to extend our appreciation to our host 
European Union for choosing this beautiful city, Noumea to hold this meeting.  
I would also like to thank Mr. Kennedy, the Executive Secretary and the Secretariat 
staffs for your excellent work in preparing the complete meeting documents and 
arranging this meeting. 
According to the Management Procedure schedule, the new Management Procedure 
will guide the setting of Total Allowable Catch for 2021 to 2023. During the 23th 
Extended Scientific Committee, members have initially reviewed the development 
and the stock rebuild target of each Candidate Management Procedures. I believe that 
our effort on the development of the new Management Procedure is a crucial progress 
for the Commission toward carrying out the new Management Procedure in time. 
Other than that, for the first time, the development of new Management Procedures 
this year incorporates data from Gene-tagging and Close-kin into the analysis models. 
I think it would be very helpful to simulate future stock status more effectively with 
abundant data input. 
Meanwhile, the accidental by-catch occurs during operation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
has always been our concerned issues, especially on the implementation of Seabird 
by-catch mitigation measures. With the conservation of Ecologically Related Species 
in mind, Taiwan is and has been in compliance with the Conservation and 
Management Measure for Ecologically Related Species of relevant tuna Regional 
Fisheries Management Organizations.  
Finally, I look forward to working with all members in the following days to achieve 
constructive outcomes for the sustainability of SBT fishery. 
Thank you. 
Attachment 4 – 4 
 
Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Honorable Chairman and Executive Secretary,  
Distinguished Delegates, Observers, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
On behalf of the Government of the Republic Indonesia, I would like to thank to the 
European Union for hosting this meeting in this beautiful island of New Caledonia. I 
am also taking this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to the Executive 
Secretary, Mr. Robert Kennedy and all Secretariat Staffs for their work throughout the 
year, and for always making excellent jobs in preparing all working papers and 
ensuring the meeting runs smoothly.  
As we noted since last year when the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC-22) 
advised that the stocks assessment results gave the positive signal of earlier rebuilding 
of the stock than anticipated in 2011, the last Extended Scientific Committed (ESC-
23) held in San Sabastian also remains providing us with good confidence on the 
stock recovery process.  The continued positive signal of stock recovery process is 
expected to be able to increase our fighting spirit on the efforts to improve our 
conservation and management measures that have been carried out so far.  
As Indonesian concern last year, on how to utilize IT system to improve our fisheries 
management, Indonesia has currently developed the electronic logbook system to be 
implemented gradually to all fishing vessels above 30 GT.  The system will be 
integrated to all national database monitoring systems, including Fishing Permit, 
VMS, Fishing Port Landing, Catch Certificate, and others. With that, hopefully 
Indonesia can improve data quality to be submitted to the Secretariat, provide more 
accurate operational data as well as ERS information which are also our main 
concerns in managing SBT.  In simultaneously, the Fisheries Improvement Programs 
for Tuna Fisheries and the Harvest Strategy Framework for Tropical Tuna Fisheries 
have been implemented by Indonesia, in which, these and all other Indonesian 
commitments will hopefully give directly or indirectly benefits for the improvement 
of conservation and management of tuna fisheries including Southern Bluefin Tuna. 
To conclude my remarks, I wish all important agenda to be deliberated this week on 
this commission meeting will provide the fruitful results which can contribute 
significantly to our joint efforts to meet the CCSBT objectives.  With that, I would 
like to underline our willingness to work constructively and co-operatively with other 
delegations to a success of this meeting. 
Thank you 
Attachment 4 – 5 
 
Opening Statement by Japan 
 
Good morning.  On behalf of the Japanese Delegation, I would like to extend our 
greeting to the Chairperson and all participants. 
First of all, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to the European Union for 
hosting this meeting here in Noumea. 
I would also like to extend our thanks to the Executive Secretary, Mr. Kennedy and 
the staff of the CCSBT Secretariat for their strenuous efforts for organizing this 
meeting, as well as to the interpreters who always do excellent job. 
One of the issues to be discussed at this meeting is selection of candidate management 
objectives. This was extensively discussed at the meeting of the Strategy and Fisheries 
Management Working Group last March.  Since the Scientific Committee did 
excellent work on this, I believe that we can make a decision easily at this meeting.  
We would like to continue frank discussion with other Members towards the adoption 
of a management procedure next year. 
The second issue is IUU fisheries by non-Members.  The Commission has been 
informed recently that Chinese longline fishing vessels allegedly caught SBT in the 
SBT fishing grounds and tried to transship them under the name of yellowfin tuna.  
IUU fishing activities by non-Members could pose a threat on sustainable use of the 
SBT resource and the Commission should move quickly to address them.  It should be 
noted, however, that this case contains several sensitive issues and therefore should be 
handled with caution.  
The third issue is ERS.  The Commission has been discussing how to deal with ERS 
issues at every annual meeting with no conclusion.  However, EU proposed a new 
approach at the meeting of the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group 
last March.  A new draft resolution has been submitted in line with this.  While 
several parts of this paper should be amended in our ideas, we could support the 
general direction.  We would like to cooperate with other Members towards 
finalization of the resolution at this meeting. 
Finally, I would like to conclude my remarks by hoping that we will be able to make 
an important step for the future development of the CCSBT and for the re-building of 
SBT stock, through a constructive discussion among all participants during this four-
day meeting. 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Tena koutou, tënä koutou, tënä koutou katoa. Nga mihi nui ki a koutou 
(Greetings to everyone gathered here) 
On behalf of the New Zealand delegation I would like to thank the European Union 
for hosting this meeting and also the local government of New Caledonia for its 
welcome.  
I would also like to extend our thanks to the members of the Secretariat and to the 
Chairs of the CCSBT subsidiary bodies for their work throughout the year. We look 
forward to working with you all during the course of this meeting.   
We are encouraged by the progress in the development of a new management 
procedure at the recent meeting of the Extended Scientific Committee and the 
willingness of members to consider more ambitious targets for final adoption. We 
look forward to the presentation of the ESC Chair and the subsequent discussion 
noting that further development will be required over the coming year.  
However the management procedure review reminds us of the unfinished business of 
this Commission. I refer to the continued uncertainty in relation to Australian farm 
and Japanese market reporting. We have yet to see the introduction of stereo video in 
the farming operations to reflect a commitment made to this Commission in 2006. We 
also have ongoing suggestions that the amount of fish available on the Japanese 
market exceeds the authorised and reported amount. The lack of resolution of these 
issues obstructs open and transparent communication between members and has the 
potential to prejudice the interests of the members not involved.  
New Zealand is committed to its role as a CCSBT member and as always is here to 
work constructively with other delegations to meet the objectives of the Commission. 
However we also wish to ensure that there is equity between members and that the 
interests of some members are not simply ignored. To sign up to a new Management 
Procedure that includes substantial levels of non-reporting as its baseline to take 
account of farm and market uncertainty is in our view prejudicial to the interests of 
New Zealand and other members of the Commission. In our view this uncertainty 
should be removed or accounted for within the national allocations of the members 
concerned as attributable catch. There are solutions available and I can again only 
encourage concerted action over the next year to implement them. 
We are also pleased to see the potential for resolution of another ongoing and 
unresolved issue regarding the adoption of a binding resolution on the application of 
spatially based measures to mitigate the impacts of fishing on ecologically related 
species.  This would be a significant step forward for this Commission and would 
have significant reputational benefits. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Republic of Korea 
 
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen. 
On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Korea, I would like to express our 
sincere appreciation to EU for hosting the 25th session of the Extended Commission 
for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in this beautiful city of Noumea with 
their warm hospitality. And I would also like to extend my thanks to Executive 
Secretary, Mr. Robert Kennedy, his staff and local organizers for preparing and 
supporting this meeting. And I would like to further extend our gratitude to the Chairs 
of subsidiary bodies for their hard works for this Commission. 
Mr. Chairman, it is certainly good for us to be informed that the ESC has confirmed 
the SBT stock is this year again showing more positive status and recovery which 
would be expected to reach the interim rebuilding target about 10 year earlier than set 
with the MP adoption in 2011. These are supported by higher recruitments and 
consistent positive trend in the longline CPUE estimates in recent years. The other 
news is certainly the new MP development. The ESC agreed the target levels which 
are 30% of unfished level by 2035 and 35% unfished level by 2040, of which 
specified by the SFMWG meeting in March. Korea hopes that this new MP would be 
more rubust to a range of uncertainty, including the question of unaccounted mortality 
and others.  
I would like to note that Korea has made a progress in scientific activities such as 
CPUE stadardization and biological study. The ESC evaluated that Korean CPUE 
series are very valuable as CPUE monitoring series that are completely independent 
of the core CPUE series used in MP work. In addition, Korean SBT otolith and 
ovaries collected the Atlantic Ocean would be useful for comparison with those 
collected in the Indian Ocean collected by other members. Korea will continue to 
enforce scientific activities. Korea has actively participated in seabird mitigation 
activities in collaboration with RFMOs and birdlife international since 2012. 
With regard to the MCS, the Ministry of Oceans & Fisheries (MOF) operates an 
electronic reporting system to the full extent after a trial operation, applying to all 
Korean flagged distant water fishing vessels. It is the system that provides information 
including fishing efforts and catches of the vessel operating outside of Korea’s 
jurisdiction to a designated in-land office responsible for monitoring, control and 
surveillance activities via a satellite-based communication device. 
Mr. Chairman, this year we are assigned many important tasks under your 
chairmanship. First one is to confirm the TAC for 2019.  
The second one is amendment of Resolution. Many proposals have been submitted 
this year as usual. We would like to contribute our genuine dedication in order for 
these agendas presented or left to be adopted by consensus.  
Before closing, I look forward to productive and successful outcomes for the 
conservation and sustainable use of SBT stock based on our cooperation among 
members, cooperating non-member and stakeholders.

Opening Statement by South Africa 
 
Chairperson,  
CCSBT Executive Secretary,  
Esteemed Members, Delegates and Observers, all Protocol observed.  
On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of South Africa, I would like to thank the 
European Union for hosting the 25th Annual Meeting of the Extended Commission of 
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in this beautiful City 
of Nouméa. I would also like to express my deep appreciation to the CCSBT 
Secretariat staff for the excellent preparations and arrangements for this meeting. 
Lastly, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the interpreters. 
South Africa is one of the few range states for the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) and 
is situated close to some of this species’ most productive fishing grounds. As a 
developing nation, South Africa is well placed in terms of its geographic location and 
its available infrastructure to further develop its tuna directed fisheries and in 
particular the fishery for SBT. 
Esteemed delegates, last year South Africa concluded the allocation of new fishing 
rights in the Large Pelagic Longline sector, 60 fishing rights were allocated for 15 
years. As reported last year, an independent law expert reviewed South Africa’s 
fisheries legislation in relation to relevant Conservation Management Measures 
adopted by the various tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations, which 
South Africa is a Contracting Party Member to. We have incorporated the 
recommendations that emanated from the review to our domestic policies.  
Having taken this step, South Africa is committed to continuous improvement and 
endeavors to adhere to the all the relevant Conservation Management Measures as 
adopted by CCSBT. It is thus not by chance that we have increased our compliance 
with the relevant adopted measures in the last couple of years. We have significantly 
improved our reporting of all relevant data and we have increased our Observer 
Coverage this year in the Large Pelagic Longline Sector to 20%.  
Chairperson, now that South Africa is a full member of the CCSBT with an increased 
SBT allocation, an allocation system for SBT has been put in place as this species has 
now become a viable target for South African tuna fisheries. With the revised 
management system, individual SBT quotas can now be monitored and controlled. 
We have improved data collection efforts, to this end, South Africa has developed a 
new Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) database to minimise data capturing errors 
and prevent invalid data formats and duplicates, thereby increasing data capturing 
efficiency. In addition, for the first time South Africa is using the CCSBT centralised 
tags starting this year. 
We have been able to strengthen our research and scientific capacity on tuna fisheries. 
Over the last two years we have been an active participant at the 2017 OMMP 
meeting in Seattle at the Extended Scientific Committee meetings in 2017 and 2018, 
which took place in Yogyakarta and San Sebastian, respectively. Through 
considerable research infrastructure and qualified personnel South Africa is dedicated 
to continuously further its contribution to the collection and analyses of data 
necessary to improve our understanding of SBT. Esteemed delegates, as you may 
probably know, South Africa has been among the pioneer nations to implement the 
Operational Management Procedures, OMP in short, into real-world fisheries 
management, with the South African hake OMP being one of the most well-known 
early success stories. Being a fairly new full member to the CCSBT, South Africa 
embraces the opportunity to fully engage in the Management Procedure development 
and on-going evaluation processes and thereby play its part to carry yet another 
success story of fisheries management into the future.  
Esteemed delegates, this year Quality Assurance Review was conducted on South 
Africa to provide independent reviews in order to help identify as to how well our 
management systems function with respect to their CCSBT obligations and to provide 
recommendations in areas where improvement is needed. The final report was 
provided to South Africa in September 2018. The Department is currently studying 
the report and will soon be engaging with key stakeholders in order to address any 
identified weaknesses as well as recommendations provided. 
Chairperson, as have been expressed in the previous Commission Meeting, South 
Africa will continue to endeavor to improve its allocation of SBT. Improved 
allocations within a thriving, well managed fishing industry will lead to the creation 
of new jobs and the improvement of the livelihoods of South African fishers and their 
families.  
Chairperson, I am confident that the 25th Annual Meeting of the Extended 
Commission of the CCSBT will have constructive, fruitful discussions and good 
decisions that are guided by mutual respect, fairness as well as by the desire to 
sustainably manage the SBT population for the benefit of all and including future 
generations.  
I thank you. 
Attachment 5 – 1 
 
Opening Statement by BirdLife International and Humane Society International 
 
This opening statement is made on behalf of Humane Society International (HSI) and 
BirdLife International. We thank the Extended Commission for the opportunity to 
participate once again as observers to this important decision-making meeting. We 
hope that this meeting will see concerted and important steps forward in securing the 
sustainability of the SBT fishery, both in terms of SBT and in terms of the impact that 
SBT fishing has on non-target species. 
Both our organisations have long highlighted the very high rates of albatross bycatch 
in CCSBT longline fisheries – of all five tuna commissions CCSBT has the highest 
degree of overlap between its fisheries and albatrosses, such that it is impossible for 
CCSBT member states to escape responsibility for seabird deaths caused by the tuna 
longliners they authorise. Indeed, recent technological advances in MCS, and the 
public nature of some of that information will make it even more difficult to escape 
that responsibility, and in the coming years CCSBT member states will be held more 
accountable for their actions relating to ERS, as both transparency and scrutiny 
increases.    
We welcome the good news that the target stock of southern bluefin tuna seems to be 
showing some signs of recovery in response to strong recruitment, however we urge 
CCSBT members to remember that for every two tonnes increase in SBT longline 
catch, another albatross will be killed.  
Currently, CCSBT only requires authorised vessels to use bird scaring lines and to 
follow the seabird bycatch mitigation requirements of other tuna RFMOs. However, 
the continued very high rates of albatross bycatch in some CCSBT longline fleets, 
their low reported compliance with use of mitigation measures, and the lack of ability 
of CCSBT to undertake compliance actions under the current system means improved 
mitigation measures are urgently required to reduce the severe impact that CCSBT 
fisheries continue to have on albatross populations.  
HSI and BirdLife urge the CCSBT to adopt clear, binding requirements for vessels to 
use effective seabird bycatch mitigation measures, as a condition of access to the SBT 
fishery, and that these requirements must reflect best practice bycatch mitigation as 
recommended by the Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels 
(ACAP). 
BirdLife and HSI support the effort by the European Union and New Zealand to bring 
forward a binding ERS measure for CCSBT. This represents an important step 
forward as long as it clearly establishes the ability of the CCSBT compliance process 
to monitor and enforce compliance with the ERS measure under CCSBT’s Corrective 
Actions Policy. In doing so, CCSBT must fully embed into its Monitoring Control 
and Surveillance (MCS) the elements necessary to monitor and enforce this ERS 
Resolution, including within inspections in port, at-sea, and during transhipment. 
However, it should be recognised that the existing seabird bycatch mitigation 
measures of WCPFC, IOTC and ICCAT fall short of ACAP best practice advice, 
which includes more effective line weighting specifications, the option of using of 
hook shielding devices, and the use of three measures, not two, in areas of highest 
albatross bycatch.  CCSBT fisheries have some of the highest albatross bycatch in the 
world. If CCSBT is to fulfil its duties under current international legal frameworks to 
remove the threat of extinction posed by the longline fishing it authorises, the 
proposed seabird bycatch mitigation measure on the table must go further to fully 
reflect ACAP best practice.  
HSI and Birdlife would like to reiterate our position and support for a stand-alone 
seabird bycatch mitigation measure at CCSBT, consistent with acceptance of ACAP 
best practice advice, reflecting the level of protection necessary and essential for 
seabirds through the range of SBT. 
We would like to conclude by reminding member States that almost all Southern 
Hemisphere populations of albatrosses remain threatened with extinction, some of 
which are predicted to be functionally extinct within twenty years – and that longline 
fisheries in high risk areas, authorised by tuna RFMOs, continue to be the principal 
cause of the problem. It’s now twenty years since CCAMLR members took effective 
steps to fix this same albatross bycatch problem in sub-Antarctic toothfish fisheries. 
We know what needs to be done and the world is growing tired of waiting for tuna 
fisheries to fix their problem.  
Thank you Chair and Members for your time.

Opening Statement by WWF 
 
Thank you Mr Chair. 
WWF sincerely thank the Commission for allowing WWF to participate and 
contribute as an observer to meeting of the Extended Commission. We would like to 
thank EU for hosting this meeting and the Secretariat for the wonderful preparation.  
WWF recognize that the latest stok assessment by the Scientific Committee indicated 
that the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) stock is estimated to 13% of its unfished 
spawning stock biomass, however, the stock status is still at an extremely low level, 
and well below the level that could produce maximum sustainable yield. As a result, 
WWF maintain our strong concerns regarding the health of the SBT stock and 
remains committed to restoring and rebuilding this ecologically and economically 
important fishery resource.  
As the Scientific Committee mentioned, we believe that it is urgent to quantify all 
sources of unaccounted SBT mortality and take necessary actions on the issue. WWF 
strongly recommend the Commission to prioritize this matter and make every effort in 
quantifying estimates for all sources of unaccounted mortality. 
Unaccounted mortality catch remains a crucial issue relating to potential under-
reporting by Members and catch and discard by Non-Members. Last year, it was 
revealed that Chinese flagged unlicensed vessels to fish for SBT, and misreported 
over 100 tonnes of SBT as another tuna species. We are very disappointed that this 
year, again, there were a number of Chinese-flagged longliners situated in the 
Southern Indian Ocean and it was confirmed that SBT to be caught and/or taken as 
bycatch by those longliners without propoer reporting.  
Recognizing that the common definition of attributable catch is fully implemented 
from the 2018 quota year, WWF expess our serious concerns on such IUU events that 
could jourpatize all good efforts made by the Commission to rebuiled the SBT stock 
to sustainable level. Therefore, we urge the Commission to improve the monitoring, 
control, and surveillance to eansure that only licensed vessels are operating and 
subject to adequate oversight including high seas boarding and inspection. Until such 
pragmatic MCS system is implemented and the Commission is able to quantify the 
estimates, we recommend the Commission to be more precautionary to set larger 
reduction than 306t in the annual TAC available for allocation to Members account 
for IUU catch by Non-Members. 
Scientific observers play an important role in ensuring the compliance of management 
measures and collecting information on ERS. WWF urge the Commission to increase 
the target level of observer coverage for longliners from 10% to 20% to ensure 
statistical validity for scientific/stock assessment purposes. A higher rate of coverage 
would be necessary for MCS purposes as well. In light of the increased number of 
juvenile fish, we also urge the Comission to strengthen the monitoring of SBT 
fisheries not limited to increasing the observer coverage on longline vessels and 
coupling technologies by implementing best practice stereo video monitoring and 
vessel monitoring systems to implementing. In order to support human observers to 
conduct their duties, it is recommended to consider ensuring observer safety and 
security in SBT fisheries by revising the Standards as nescessary. 
Furthermore, WWF call for a better protection of the SBT spawning ground where 
known to be in the waters between Indonesia and Australia. We believe this is 
important step to do to accelerate the stock rebuilding at biomass level effort. We 
propose an effective measures to be implemented to sustain the SBT stock in the 
region, while incentive should also be provided to the neighboring country who will 
be affected by such management. 
Regarding Ecologically Related Species (ERS), although the ERS Working Group has 
not expressed specific concerns about shark bycatch in SBT fisheries, we encourage 
the Commission to collect relevant data and instruct the Scientific Committee and 
ERS Working Group to consider the prioritisation of research and management for 
affected shark and ray species. 
WWF strongly expect Members to make the necessary decisions, with the required 
sense of urgency, in order to demonstrate effective conservation of ERS, especially 
sharks, seabirds and marine turtles, requesting that the FAO code of conduct for 
responsible fisheries should be made mandatory not to keep as voluntary. 
Thank you, Mr Chair and Members.

Attachment 7 
 
Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
Mr Dominic Vallières (New Zealand) agreed to chair the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC). The FAC was tasked with the following agenda:  
• Policy to formalise treatment of resources received free of charge and in-kind 
contributions; 
• Review changes to Financial Regulations to allow the use of recognised 
independent auditors 
• Revision of the 2018 budget  
• Draft 2019 budget  
• Draft indicative budgets for 2020 and 2021   
 
Resources received free of charge and in-kind contributions 
The most recent audit of the Commission recommend that it formalise its accounting 
policy regarding the treatment of resources received free of charge and in-kind 
contributions.  The Secretariat drafted a policy based on this recommendation, which 
is provided at Annex A.  It was noted that the policy would lead to changes in the 
reporting provided to auditors but would not influence the budgeting process that is 
conducted as part of the FAC.  
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission adopt the CCSBT policy 
regarding the treatment of resources received free of charge and in-kind 
contributions in the CCSBT’s Annual Financial Statements. 
Use of Independent Auditors 
The CCSBT’s Financial Regulations currently require that the Commission appoint an 
“external auditor who shall be the Auditor-General or equivalent statutory authority 
from a Member of the Commission”. Within Australia, this is the Australian National 
Audit Office (ANAO).  To enable the CCSBT to consider alternatives, the CCSBT’s 
Financial Regulations require amending and the Secretariat has proposed a revised 
draft, which is provided at Annex B. 
The Chair noted that the changes proposed were in line with the approach taken 
across a number of other RFMOs and that the Commission was committed to the 
current audit provider for 2019 so that any changes agreed would only apply to audits 
conducted from 2020 and onwards. 
The FAC supported the proposal to allow greater flexibility and asked that the 
Secretariat seek quotes from alternate audit service providers in 2019 and relay 
outcomes of this exercise to Members via Circular. 
Australia supports efforts to minimise costs but expressed a preference for the 
services of the ANAO to be retained if quotes received from alternative providers do 
not allow for meaningful savings. 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission endorse the proposed changes 
to the Financial Regulations to allow flexibility in the choice of auditors. 
The revised budget for 2018 
The Executive Secretary gave a summary of the 2018 revised budget outlined in 
CCSBT-EC/1810/06. The revision incorporates actual income and expenditure 
together with forecast income and expenditure for the remainder of the year. The 
Executive Secretary identified a further $22,718 in cost reductions to the FAC since 
the figures produced for CCSBT-EC/1810/06. With these reductions, expenditure for 
2018 is forecast to total $2,783,035, which is 4.5% lower than the amount which had 
been budgeted. The Executive Secretary also wished to note the voluntary and in-kind 
contributions made by Australia, the European Union, New Zealand and the CSIRO. 
The Executive Secretary provided additional details on individual items of the revised 
2018 budget where significant changes had occurred from the initially planned 
amounts. 
Members of the FAC thanked the Secretariat for its efforts to reduce costs given the 
budgeting constraints faced by the Commission. 
Australia provided an update on the status of the Secretariat tax exemption under the 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (Privileges and 
Immunities) Regulations 1996. Australia advised that regulatory changes were being 
sought to reinstate the exemption and that those changes would apply retrospectively 
from the time that the matter was raised with the relevant Australian Government 
department (19 June 2017). 
FAC members expressed concern at the financial implications of this situation and the 
uncertainty created in terms of budgetary planning. 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission note the revised budget for 
2018 at Annex C. 
 
Draft budget for 2019 
The FAC considered the proposed budgets outlined in CCSBT-EC/1810/06, which 
includes funding for the CCSBT’s usual business. The draft budget contained 
$185,736 more expenditure than the interim budget, which had been previously 
circulated to Members. The increase in expenditure was largely driven by additional 
expenses related to farm and market analysis in the updated ESC work plan.  
The Chair noted that the transition from the aerial survey to gene tagging technology 
along with the additional expenses related to the development of a new MP continue 
to impact on the financial position of the Commission.  
In order to reduce expenses during this financially burdensome period for CCSBT, the 
FAC declined the ESC requests for a Webinar MP consultation. For similar reasons 
but also based on the doubts and constraints highlighted by the EU, a decision was 
made to delay the EU QAR to 2020 and remove the funding allocated to the 2019 
budget. 
To reflect comments made in plenary, FAC members were also asked to consider 
budgetary options that would allow a technical one day workshop to be held 
immediately prior to the Compliance Committee.  South Africa agreed to extend the 
financial support that it is already providing to the hosting of meetings in 2019 to 
accommodate the additional venue costs of the one day workshop. The Chair thanked 
South Africa for its generosity. 
Considerable discussion was had on the ESC work plan item related to the farming 
and market analysis. Members did not support the budgeted amount presented in the 
initial paper drafted by the Secretariat. Japan proposed a smaller scale alternative 
which would cover the funding of two experts to attend the next meeting of the ESC 
and provide support on farming and market issues in order to resolve the current 
impasse. 
Members questioned whether the smaller scale project proposed could deliver on the 
original objectives identified by the ESC. A number of concerns were also raised 
relating to the uncertainty in expected outputs from the experts and any terms of 
reference associated with their involvement with the ESC. 
Australia noted that it was confident about its current system and that the concerns 
about it were from some other Members. The current provisions in the assessment 
were there for testing robustness, not because they were factual. 
Many of the issues raised were beyond the scope of the FAC and were referred to 
plenary for further discussion. The FAC has agreed to include a $50,000 item in the 
2019 budget for two experts to support the ESC on farming and market issues; 
recognising that further clarity on the specific use of the funds will need to be 
resolved intersessionally when drafting terms of reference.   
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission approve the 2019 General 
Budget as set out in Annex D to this document.  
 
Indicative budgets for 2020 and 2021 
The FAC was also asked to consider indicative budgets for the two years beyond the 
upcoming budget.  Members of the FAC examined the indicative budgets and briefly 
looked for potential savings that could be made. 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission note the proposed changes to 
the indicative 2020 and 2021 budgets. 
 
 
Financial Burden on Members 
A number of Members raised concerns about the financial impact that the recent 
increases in contribution levels were having. The group considered whether the 
current target of constraining annual increases to contributions to below 10% was 
sustainable. 
Members recognised the importance of this issue but also wished to balance the need 
to have an efficient Secretariat and the ability to fund significant projects in a given 
year. Funding pressures on Member governments is likely to be an ongoing concern 
for several Members. 
 
 
Annex A 
 
CCSBT policy regarding the treatment of resources received free of charge and 
in-kind contributions in the CCSBT’s Annual Financial Statements 
 
Members of the Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna, 
 
Noting that Article 10.3 (c) of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna describes “The Secretariat functions shall be prescribed by the 
Commission, and shall include preparing administrative and other reports for the 
Commission and the 
Scientific Committee”,  
 
Further noting that, the Secretariat submits the annual financial statement to Members 
of Extended Commission and the external auditor not later than 1 March every year in 
accordance with Regulation 10.2 and 10.5 of CCSBT’s Financial Regulations, 
 
Recognising that, in the audit of the 2017 financial statements, the external auditor 
recommended that the Commission formalises its accounting policy regarding the 
treatment of resources received free of charge and in-kind contributions, 
 
Agree as follows: 
 
1. Subject to a threshold of financial materiality, the Commission will disclose 
resources received free of charge and in-kind contributions to the CCSBT in its 
Annual Financial Statements in accordance with paragraph 2 to 4 of this policy. 
 
2. Resources received free of charge or in-kind contributions will be included in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income when: 
(a)  The dollar amounts can be reliably determined1; and 
(b)  The function or task being conducted with the resource is of a nature such that 
the CCSBT would have sought to conduct that function or task in the absence 
of these resources/services. 
 
3. If the disclosure of a resource received free of charge or in-kind contribution is 
included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the nature of the gain will be 
clearly specified as a resource received free of charge or an in-kind contribution 
and the use of the resource/service will be recognised as an expense. 
 
4. Where a resource received free of charge or an in-kind contribution is not included 
in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the resources/contribution received 
will be described in a note within the Annual Financial Statements. 
                                                 
1 In cases where the value of a resource or contribution is specified by the Party that provided the 
resource/contribution, the specified value shall be considered to be the correct amount for the resource/contribution 
for inclusion in the Annual Financial Statements. Where precises amounts are not known, quotes or recent past 
costs, may be used to estimate amounts. However, in the case of meetings, past costs are not considered reliable 
unless they involve the same country, venue and equipment providers. If estimated amounts are believed to have a 
material level of error, then they should not be considered to be reliably determined for the purposes of this 
paragraph.

1 These estimates are rounded up to the nearest $100
2 The EU is hosting these meetings in 2018 and it has provided a grant to the CCSBT Secretariat for the Secretariat to pay the catering, venue and 
equipment hire components of these costs.
3 Australia (AU) and New Zealand (NZ) jointly funded the participation of two panel members. The negative forecast remaining expenditure is due to a 
reimbursement for the panel Members that had not been provided as at 31 August 2018 (but has since been provided). The forecast final expenditure 
does not include the cost of these panel members as it was an AU/NZ initiative (not a CCSBT decision) to have these panel Members at the meeting.
4 New Zealand is contributing $9,825.45 towards the consultants costs for the OMMP 9 meeting.
5 The EU is contributing up to 80,000 euros for stage 1 of the 2018 long term gene tagging project.
6 CSIRO is providing an "In-kind" contribution to this project of $322,000.
7 CSIRO is providing an "In-kind" contribution of up to $61,000 for the close-kin work.

Attachment 8 
 
Terms of Reference  
for Discussion on Australian Farm Analysis and Japanese Market Analysis  
at the 2019 ESC Meeting 
 
1. Selection of external experts 
Each Member of the EC may nominate one external expert1 having expertise in 
tuna farm analysis and one external expert having expertise in tuna market 
analysis to the Secretariat by the end of January 2019. The Secretariat will 
circulate the list of experts nominated by EC Members by the end of February 15, 
2019. If more than one expert is nominated for one field, the EC will choose one 
expert in that field from among the candidates by voting (simple majority) as soon 
as possible for the farm analysis and for the market analysis. Nominations must 
include a current CV, declaration of conflicts of interest and demonstration of 
independence. 
(1) In selecting the expert for the Australian Farm Analyses preference should be 
given to an understanding of the operational aspects of Australian or similar 
tuna farming and expertise in statistical analysis and inference, including the 
modelling of multi-nomial distributions 
(2) In selecting the expert for the Japanese Market Analyses, preference should be 
given to an understanding of the structure of tuna markets and transactions of 
tunas. 
 
2. Expected outcomes at the 2019 ESC Meeting 
The 2019 ESC Meeting is expected to review the history of discussion on these 
two issues and develop methodologies for estimating possible unaccounted 
mortality.   
 
3. Roles of experts  
(1)  In general, the external experts are expected to: 
• Review historical reports and information;  
                                                      
1 The expert shall not directly or indirectly be employed by Australian and Japanese governments and/or 
industry for the farm analysis and market analysis respectively or have any other conflict of interest at 
the time of appointment nor throughout the term of the contract, or in the previous three years. 
• Provide independent advice on technical matters; and 
• Contribute ideas on a way forward. 
(2) For Australian Farm Analyses, the external expert is expected to: 
• provide advice on the appropriate methods that could be applied to the 
analysis of the data potentially available (including CDS data) to assist 
with catch estimation for the Australian Farm Fishery. The advice would 
also detail any assumptions that would need to be satisfied for each 
method to be applicable and the implication these have on statistical 
inference. 
(3) For the Japanese Market Analyses, the external expert is expected to: 
• provide advice on the range of methods that could be applied to allow 
connection between CDS data submitted from Members and some Non-
Members, to CDS tagID and sale of fish. The advice would detail the 
assumptions that would need to be satisfied for each method to be 
applicable. 
• provide advice on a methodology that takes better account of the current 
market conditions.   
(4) The external experts will be allowed access to confidential documents subject 
to a confidentiality agreement, and if required, they may have access (in 
accordance with the Member’s domestic requirements) to confidential data 
necessary for accomplishment of the work, subject to the agreement on data

Revised Terms of Reference of the 
Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group 
 
Composition and Operation 
1. 
The Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group (SFMWG) shall 
consist of the Commissioners from Members of the Extended Commission, 
the Secretariat, and as appropriate, other experts in fisheries management, 
compliance and fisheries science. Numbers of participants will be kept to a 
minimum.

Attachment 14 
 
Resolution to Align CCSBT’s Ecologically Related Species measures 
with those of other tuna RFMOs 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
Recalling the decision made at the 5th Strategy and Fisheries Management Working 
Group Meeting to develop a binding Ecological Related Species (ERS) measure for 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) Members 
without duplicating the effort of other tuna RFMOs by creating a CCSBT Resolution 
that requires CCSBT Members to follow the ERS measures of other relevant tuna 
RFMOs, 
Noting the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation 
and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the 
need to cooperate and ensure consistency between conservation and management 
measures in the different tuna regional fisheries management organisations, 
Concerned that some seabird species, notably some albatrosses and petrels, are 
threatened with global extinction, 
Mindful that fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna can also cause incidental harm to other 
species such as sea turtles, sharks and cetaceans, 
Further recalling the requirement in Article 5(2) of the Convention for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna that the Parties shall expeditiously provide to 
the CCSBT data on, inter alia, ecologically related species, 
Determined to mitigate incidental harm to ecologically related species caused by fishing 
for Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
Noting the importance of harmonising conservation and management measures with 
other organisations responsible for managing international fisheries, as agreed at the 
Kobe Meeting of Joint Tuna RFMOs on 26 January 2007, 
Reaffirming the recommendation at the seventh meeting of the Ecologically Related 
Species Working Group (ERSWG) held in Tokyo from 3 to 6 July 2007, that Members 
and Cooperating Non-Members will provide national reports on their interactions with 
ecologically related species in Southern Bluefin Tuna fisheries to the ERSWG, 
Agrees in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8, that: 
1. For the purposes of this CCSBT Resolution: 
a) the ‘Area of Competence of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission’ is that 
described in Article 2 of the Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian 
Ocean Tuna Commission;  
b) the ‘Convention Area of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 
Commission’ is that described in Article 3 of the Convention on the 
Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western 
and Central Pacific Ocean;  
c) the ‘Convention Area of the International Commission for the Conservation of 
Atlantic Tunas’ is that described in Article 1 of the International Convention 
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas;  
d) An Area defined in paragraphs a) – c) above is an “Area of Competence” and 
are collectively the “Areas of Competence”;  
e) ‘ERS Measures’ mean all measures relating to ecologically related species in 
force in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), the Western and Central 
Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the International Commission for the 
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), as adopted and amended from time 
to time, as contained in Annex I; 
f) Member or Cooperating Non-Member means a Member or Cooperating Non-
Member of the Extended Commission of the CCSBT. 
2. This Resolution shall apply to all vessels on the ‘CCSBT Record of fishing vessels 
authorised to fish for Southern Bluefin Tuna’ in the Areas of Competence. Each 
Member and Cooperating Non-Member shall ensure that such vessels flying its flag 
and fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area of Competence comply with all 
ERS Measures in force in that Area of Competence (whether or not the Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member is a member of the tuna RFMO in which the ERS 
Measures were adopted). 
3. Where Areas of Competence overlap, Members and Cooperating Non-Members 
shall elect which applicable RFMO’s ERS Measures to apply.  
4. Each Member and Cooperating Non-Member shall ensure that effective action is 
taken in response to a vessel flying its flag that fails to comply with the obligations 
contained in the ERS Measures when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area 
of Competence. If a Member or Cooperating Non-Member of the Extended 
Commission undertakes fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area of 
Competence of a Convention of which it is not a Member, that Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member shall report, if any, such actions relating to the relevant 
ERS Measures to the Compliance Committee of the CCSBT, unless the compliance 
of that Member or Cooperating Non-Member with such ERS measures is assessed 
in the appropriate body of that Convention.  
5. The CCSBT secretariat will annually update the list of ERS Measures contained in 
Annex I before the CCSBT Extended Commission Meeting according to any 
decisions taken on ecologically related species at the Annual Meetings of the IOTC, 
WCPFC, and ICCAT. 
6. Except in the case of WCPFC, Members and Cooperating Non-Members that have 
formally objected to an ERS Measure in the relevant tuna RFMO, and who, by 
reason of that formal objection and the operation of the tuna RFMO’s decision-
making rules, are not bound by that ERS Measure, are exempted from applying that 
ERS Measure when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in the applicable Area of 
Competence. In the case of WCPFC, Members and Cooperating Members that have 
sought a review of a decision on an ERS measure in accordance with Article 20, 
paragraph 6 of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly 
Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean are exempted from 
applying that ERS Measure when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in the 
applicable Area of Competence until the Measure becomes binding. 
7. The Secretariat shall annually present a report to the CCSBT Compliance 
Committee on the implementation of the ERS Measures, for the sole purpose of the 
provision of information for Members and Cooperating Non-Members.

Arrangement between 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
and 
The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
 
 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (hereafter CCSBT) 
and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
(hereafter CCAMLR); 
 
NOTING that the objective of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna (hereafter CSBT Convention) is to ensure, through appropriate 
management, the conservation and optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna; 
 
NOTING FURTHER that the objective of the Convention for the Conservation of 
Antarctic Marine Living Resources (hereafter CAMLR Convention) is the 
conservation of Antarctic marine living resources, which includes rational use; 
 
RECOGNISING that Article 12 of the CSBT Convention requires the CCSBT to 
collaborate with other inter-governmental organisations which have related objectives 
to, among other things, obtain the best available information including scientific 
information to further the attainment of the objective of the Convention and seek to 
avoid duplication with respect to the work of the other organisations.   
 
CONSIDERING that the Preamble to the CAMLR Convention recognises that it is 
desirable for CCAMLR to establish suitable machinery for recommending, 
promoting, deciding on and co-ordinating the measures and scientific studies needed 
to ensure the conservation of Antarctic marine living organisms; 
 
NOTING that provisions of the CAMLR Convention address the conservation of 
non-target, associated or dependent species which belong to the same ecosystem as 
the target species;  
 
NOTING FURTHER that the Preamble to the 2008 CCSBT Recommendation to 
Mitigate the Impact on Ecologically Related Species of Fishing for Southern Bluefin 
Tuna identifies that the CCSBT is determined to mitigate incidental harm to 
ecologically related species caused by fishing for southern bluefin tuna; 
 
DESIRING to put into place arrangements and procedures to promote cooperation in 
order to enhance the conservation and rational use of stocks and species which are 
within the competence and/or mutual interest of both organisations so as to avoid 
duplication or conflict between the activities of the two organisations; 
 
NOW THEREFORE the CCSBT and CCAMLR record the following arrangements: 
 
 
 
1. 
OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARRANGEMENT 
The objective of this Arrangement is to facilitate, where appropriate, cooperation 
between the CCSBT and CCAMLR (‘the Commissions’) with a view to enhancing 
the conservation and rational use of stocks and species which are of interest to both 
Commissions.  
 
2. 
AREAS OF COOPERATION 
The Commissions will establish and maintain consultation and cooperation in respect 
of matters of common interest to both organisations. In particular, the Commissions 
will: 
 (i) 
exchange meeting reports, information, documents and publications 
regarding matters of mutual interest, consistent with the information sharing 
policies of each Commission; 
(ii) 
exchange data and scientific information in support of the work and 
objectives of both Commissions, consistent with the information sharing 
policies of each Commission including, but not limited to information on: 
(a) vessels authorised to fish in accordance with the Commissions’ 
conservation measures; 
(b) illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing vessels; 
(c) catch, bycatch and vessel information and/or data1; 
(d) an annual CCSBT report to CCAMLR covering the global stock 
assessment of southern bluefin tuna for that year; and the latest southern 
bluefin tuna catch data classified by ocean, gear and catching country; 
and 
(e) an annual CCAMLR report to CCSBT detailing any catches (by flag and 
gear) of southern bluefin tuna from vessels fishing within the CAMLR 
Convention area. 
(iii) cooperate to harmonise approaches in areas of mutual interest and concern, 
most notably on bycatch of non-target, associated and dependent species 
(ecologically related species); 
(iv) where appropriate, collaborate on analyses and research efforts relating to 
species of mutual interest; 
(v) 
consider methods of recognising and cooperating with each other’s 
conservation and management measures; and 
(vi) consistent with each Commission’s rules of procedure, grant permanent 
reciprocal observer status to representatives of the respective Commissions in 
relevant meetings of each Commission. 
                                                 
1 Noting that publicly available CCSBT bycatch data is currently limited to information provided in 
reports to the CCSBT; that the confidentiality classification of bycatch data exchanged between 
CCSBT Members prevents its release without explicit approval of the Members providing the data 
together with a signed confidentiality agreement; and that catch data relating to individual vessels is 
classified as confidential. 
 
 
(vii) encourage cooperation between the Secretariats in areas of common interest 
such as information management, compliance evaluation, CDS, website 
developments, data modelling and infrastructure, database development, data 
exchange protocols and secretariat-administrative matters.
