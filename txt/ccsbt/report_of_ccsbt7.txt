 
 
Report of the Seventh Annual Meeting of the Commission 
18 - 21 April 2001  
Sydney, Australia 
 
 
Agenda Item 1 
 Opening of the Meeting 
 
Agenda Item 1.1. 
Welcoming address 
 
1. 
Mr Bill Mansfield opened the meeting, noting that the opening session was a public 
one and welcomed representatives from Australia, Japan, and New Zealand and observers 
from the Republic of Korea, the Republic of South Africa and Taiwan. At a later point in the 
meeting the Chair welcomed the representatives from the Republic of Indonesia. 
 
Agenda Item 1.2.  
Adoption of the Agenda 
 
2. 
The Agenda was adopted as circulated in Attachment A.  
 
3. 
The list of meeting participants is included at Attachment B. 
 
4. 
The list of documents tabled at the meeting is included at Attachment C. 
 
Agenda Item 1.3. 
Opening Statements 
 
 
Agenda Item 1.3.1. Members 
 
5. 
In introducing their position in the CCSBT, members identified those agenda items of 
highest priority to their delegation.  Opening statements are included at Attachment D. 
 
 
Agenda Item 1.3.2. Other States and Entities 
 
6. 
The Republic of Korea, the Republic of South Africa and Taiwan thanked the 
Commission for the invitation to attend the meeting. The Republic of Korea, and Taiwan 
submitted opening statements which are included at Attachment D. The Republic of South 
Africa also expressed its interest in attaining full membership with the matter still under 
consideration by the government. The Republic of Indonesia subsequently expressed interest 
in joining the CCSBT but budgetary and financial considerations had been a major constraint. 
 
 
Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
 
7. 
Mr Campbell McGregor, the Executive Secretary of the CCSBT, submitted 
document CCSBT/0104/04, a report on the activities of the Secretariat since the Sixth 
Annual meeting in March 2000. The Commission noted the Report.  
 
Agenda Item 3 
Report from the Finance and Administration 
Committee 
 
8. 
The Finance and Administration Committee considered the draft budget submitted by 
the Secretariat and amended it to accommodate additional expenditure likely to be incurred in 
2001, identified in the work plan for the Scientific Research Program, and meetings 
programmed for the remainder of 2001.  The Commission agreed to the budget at 
Attachment E, noting that governments of members would need to consider the expenditure 
in the context of national budget arrangements. The Commission also noted the possibility of 
review of the 2001 budget at CCSBT8, based on the potential accession of the Republic of 
Korea in 2001, progress on the SRP from the Scientific Committee, etc. The Republic of 
Korea’s contribution would be in the order of AUD$70,000 if it joined the Commission in the 
second half of 2001. 
 
Agenda Item 4.  Review of SBT fisheries 
 
9. 
Reports on the SBT fisheries of members as well as, reports from the Republic of 
Korea, and Taiwan are included at Attachment F. 
 
10. 
New Zealand explained that its reported SBT catch in 1999/00 quota year of 404 
tonnes included 23 tonnes of northern bluefin tuna reflecting New Zealand’s domestic 
reporting requirements which cover both northern and southern bluefin tuna species in one 
category.  
 
Agenda item 5. 
Report from the Scientific Committee  
 
Agenda Item 5.1  
Outcomes of discussions on Scientific Research 
Program 
Agenda Item 5.2  
Progress towards Stock Assessment Process 
 
11. 
The Commission noted the report of the Scientific Committee which includes a 
report on the SRP. Mr Andrew Penny, Scientific Committee Chair, presented the report of 
the Scientific Committee and in particular, the ‘Report of the SC to CCSBT on the Scientific 
Research Program’, included at Attachment G. 
 
12. 
CCSBT members thanked the Scientific Committee for their report and the input by 
the Scientific Advisory Panel and independent chairs. The Commission adopted the report 
and its recommendations including the SRP proposal.  
 
13. 
In adopting the report it was agreed to accept the offer by the Advisory Panel to 
initiate development of a management strategy evaluation framework.  
 
14. 
Japan also referred to the reference in the report that "…The data available indicate 
that the variable square interpretation of CPUE trends is not valid; there are many fish in 
areas not now being fished by Japanese longliners. This is demonstrated, at a large spatial 
scale, by the distribution of effort by other parties and, at a local scale, by results of past 
Experimental Fishing Programs….". It was confirmed that characterization of the SBT catch 
and scientific observer program should be carried out under the responsibility of the flag state 
countries in the case of high seas fishing and coastal countries in the case of fisheries within a 
200-mile zone. Japan advised that it intended to conduct a tagging program using dedicated 
longline fishing vessels, the objectives of which included investigation of mixing of small SBT 
and the migratory pattern of large SBT. Japan also stressed that need for a workshop for the 
SRP, especially for the tagging program, before CCSBT8. While individual countries will run 
some of the nine components of the SRP, it was recognized that the CCSBT should be 
involved in all components to the extent necessary to ensure that the program progressed 
satisfactorily. Japan advised that it is ready to conduct a recruitment monitoring program and 
spawning ground research program using RV Sho-yo Maru and one other research vessel. It 
requested the cooperation of related countries for the successful conduct of these programs. 
Japan also suggested observers should cover all types of fleets of all related countries/entities 
and that the observer coverage should be realistic, considering similar programs in other tuna 
regional management organizations and cost, etc.  
 
15. 
In regard to any proposals for a research program to be conducted in another 
country's EEZ, Indonesia indicated its understanding that any such program would be 
conducted with permission from the country. 
 
16. 
An informal working group met outside of the Plenary to develop a work plan for 
initial implementation of the SRP. The ‘Report of the Working Group on Implementation of 
the CCSBT Scientific Research Program’ was adopted and is at Attachment H. Japan 
requested that the unutilised portion of the Scientific Quota be carried over for future use. The 
Chair of the Scientific Committee noted that there might be a need to consider a CPUE 
interpretation experiment in the coming year, in which case access to some research quota 
would be needed. The Commission agreed to keep under review the availability of the 
unutilised research quota for use in the SRP. 
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Relationship with Non-members  
 
Agenda Item 6.1  
Indonesia, Korea, South Africa and Taiwan 
 
17. 
In dialogue between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia, the Republic of 
Indonesia indicated that it considers its take of SBT to be largely bycatch. However, it also 
believed there was some targeting of SBT by Taiwanese vessels or vessels with Taiwanese 
fishing masters. The Republic of Indonesia’s view was that about 300 tonnes of SBT were 
landed in the Republic of Indonesia. Given that about 500 vessels were operating out of Bali 
for fishing in the Indian Ocean, there was a need to clarify whether all catch has been landed 
in the Republic of Indonesia or whether some was transhipped. 
 
18. 
The Republic of Indonesia is keen to determine two things  
 
(1) 
Where exactly spawning occurs on the spawning grounds; and  
 
(2) 
What the main spawning seasons are.  
 
19. 
This information can then be used by the Republic of Indonesia to advise their 
fishermen and perhaps regulate their fishing practices. 
 
20. 
The Republic of Indonesia had indicated funding for CCSBT membership was a 
problem and had wondered whether some collaborative arrangement was possible. Australia 
and the Republic of Indonesia have already engaged in some valuable collaborative port 
sampling and monitoring work and Australia is currently working with it to develop further 
collaborative work on its tuna fisheries.  
 
21. 
The Republic of Korea advised that it is making a concerted effort to resolve those 
issues remaining for finalising its process for accession to the Convention. The Republic of 
Korea also reported its progress towards acceding to the SBT Convention with the 
expectancy of becoming a member of the CCSBT by the end of the year.  It expressed 
support for the SRP proposal, and indicated its willingness to be a participant to all SRP 
related meetings to contribute better and effective promotion of the program in the future.  
 
22. 
The Commission expressed its concern at the rate of progress of accession and 
requested that the Republic of Korea provide a specific timetable for its accession as soon as 
possible.  
 
23. 
Commission members advised the meeting that following discussions with 
representatives from Taiwan, arrangements had been developed for the establishment of an 
extended Commission and an extended Scientific Committee to facilitate the participation of 
Taiwan in the work of the Commission, in accordance with the resolution at Attachment I.  
The Commission agreed to the resolution.  In agreeing to the resolution, Japan advised that in 
relation to the Government of Japan its agreement was on the basis of interpreting the 
reference to the Exchange of Letters as not meaning an exchange of diplomatic documents. 
 
24. 
Taiwan appreciated the efforts made by the Members of the Commission regarding 
its participation in the CCSBT. With the resolution adopted, Taiwan will expedite its domestic 
process before expressing its willingness to accept the arrangements. Taiwan hopes to be a 
part of the work of the CCSBT at the earliest possible time. 
 
Agenda Item 6.2  
Others 
 
25. 
The Commission noted that the data provided by Japan on statistics of imports of 
SBT to Japan (CCSBT/0104/18) indicated changes in the catch levels of a number of non-
member countries, resulting in lower imports into Japan of SBT from these non-members.  
 
Agenda Item 6.3  
Action Plan 
 
26. 
The Commission noted the steps taken to inform countries and entities of the 
provisions of the CCSBT Action Plan (CCSBT/0104/05). In accordance with paragraph 2 
of the Action Plan, the Commission agreed to identify Cambodia, Republic of Equatorial 
Guinea, Republic of Honduras, and Belize as non-members whose vessels had been catching 
SBT in a manner which diminished the effectiveness of the Commission’s conservation and 
management measures. It was agreed that no trade action would be taken against those 
countries at this stage, however, their actions would continue to be monitored with a view to 
negotiating arrangements consistent with the Commission’s management measures if there 
was no cooperation from these countries in controlling the taking of SBT in the near future.   
 
27. 
Dialogue was continuing between the Republic of Indonesia and the Commission and 
the members agreed that Australia should continue discussions with it with a view to securing 
its cooperation. It was therefore agreed that no action be taken under the Action Plan to 
identify the Republic of Indonesia at this time, but this issue would be reviewed at CCSBT8. 
 
28. 
The joint action being taken by Japan and Taiwan to minimise the activities of Flag of 
Convenience (FOC) longline vessels was discussed.  The program involved the return of 
Taiwan-built FOC vessels to control under the Taiwan flag and the buy-back and scrapping 
of second hand Japan-built FOC vessels.  Japan considered that some vessels were outside 
the control of the government and industry organisations and this was reducing the 
effectiveness of the program.  Taiwan acknowledged that it has been unable to implement 
actions as quickly as agreed with Japan because of domestic impediments and that further 
consultations would be held in the next few weeks. 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Trade Information Scheme application and operation 
 
29. 
Japan reported that over the ten months of operation of the Scheme, SBT products 
have been imported from Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, 
Philippines, the Republic of Indonesia and the Kingdom of Tonga. While a number of the 
countries exporting to Japan have overcome the initial shortcomings of incomplete 
accompanying documentation, problems still exist with some countries. Difficulties applying to 
the documentation accompanying imports from the Republic of Indonesia have included 
failure to show the registered validation seal in the accompanying documentation, and 
incomplete catch and catch location data. The official Republic of Indonesian validation seal 
originally registered with the Secretariat has since been changed. Japan noted that data on 
farmed fish is to be supplied to the Secretariat every six months and looked forward to 
receiving this information in respect of Australia shortly. 
 
30. 
Japan requested that a letter be sent to all the relevant countries/entities to the TIS 
requesting them to appropriately implement the TIS and noted that under its domestic 
regulations regarding TIS, it is possible to hold the product received. Japan also indicated that 
it might have to apply this rule strictly.  
 
31. 
Australia will be providing a report on SBT exports of farmed SBT to the Secretariat 
shortly. Australia advised that before CCSBT 8 it will carry out a scientific assessment of 
growth rates of farmed SBT. Australia would also provide further detailed explanation of the 
TIS requirements to those domestic operators exporting SBT. 
 
32. 
New Zealand reaffirmed its commitment to the TIS. New Zealand also noted that 
the reduction of exports of SBT to Japan by some non-member countries was possibly the 
result of the TIS. New Zealand indicated that it would work to make the system work as 
efficiently as possible.  
 
33. 
Japan pointed out their understanding that Taiwan had agreed to a voluntary national 
catch limit of 1450 tonnes. However,  Japan Trade Statistics in 1999 indicated Taiwan 
exported the equivalent of over 1800 tonnes of live weight catch to Japan. Japan considered 
this apparent excess of the voluntary constraint as a serious matter. The question was raised 
as to whether these figures included catch taken by other countries including the possibility of 
catch taken by Indonesia. There is an urgent need for clarification.  
 
34. 
Taiwan replied that it has fully cooperated with the CCSBT by taking voluntary 
catch restraint and implementing the TIS program. The figures cited by Japan includes catch 
in fresh form, probably from those small longliners that have entered into fisheries cooperation 
with Indonesia.  
 
35. 
Australia found the possible link between the Republic of Indonesia and Taiwan as 
disturbing. From its information, it understands the Taiwanese skippers of the Republic of 
Indonesia/Taiwan joint fishery are targeting SBT in the SBT spawning ground and urged that 
this practice cease. 
 
36. 
Taiwan agreed that there was a need for further investigation on the catch taken by 
joint venture vessels and will follow up on the problems raised by Australia. Australia urged 
these matters (targeting on the spawning grounds and the attribution of SBT catch taken by 
Taiwanese-skippered joint venture vessels in waters of the Republic of Indonesia) be treated 
with some urgency in a scientific way, suggesting presentation of papers on this at the 
Scientific Committee meeting in August 2001. 
 
37. 
Japan, in supporting Australia’s proposal, pointed out that while the formal meeting 
should be held as early as possible, the next Scientific Committee meeting had already set its 
priorities; suggesting it be covered at an alternative meeting. In the meantime, Japan proposed 
that member countries continue informal discussions with the Republic of Indonesia and 
Taiwan. In agreeing to these proposals regarding the TIS and the targeting of SBT on the 
spawning grounds, New Zealand reiterated its desire for greater clarity in regard to these 
matters. 
 
38. 
The meeting agreed that papers on these matters be prepared for presentation at 
CCSBT8 in October 2001. 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Relationship with other organizations 
 
Agenda Item 8.1  
Reports from meetings of relevant fisheries 
management organizations 
 
39. 
Australia reported on the meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, from 29 January to 
2 February 2001, at which an ‘Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels of 
the Southern Hemisphere’ was adopted. A copy of the Conference report was tabled for 
member’s consideration out-of-session and discussion at the next Commission meeting. 
 
40. 
Commission members recognised bycatch of seabirds as an important issue and have 
taken steps to mitigate such incidental bycatch. Japan noted that it had taken action to 
conserve seabirds in accordance with the International Plan of Action and had taken steps to 
seek compliance by its industry.  Commission members agreed that action on migratory birds 
be referred the Ecologically Related Species Working Group (ERSWG). Australia and New 
Zealand proposed that sharks and turtles be included in the ERSWG’s work, while Japan 
considered the FAO to be the appropriate forum for discussion of these species.  
 
41. 
Japan indicated that the interaction between cetaceans and SBT stock and SBT 
fisheries should also be included in the work of the ERSWG. Australia and New Zealand 
indicated that they did not consider that this issue was appropriate for discussion in that 
context. 
 
 
Agenda Item 8.2  
Relevant Organizations and International Instruments 
 
42. 
The meeting considered that it was important to ensure that the CCSBT maintained 
contacts with other relevant international organisations and attend meetings relevant to the 
interests of CCSBT.  The FAO Coordinating Working Party on Fisheries Statistics (CWP), 
the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), the Commission for the Conservation of 
Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and any relevant FAO meetings should be 
priorities for the CCSBT. Attendance at other fora, such as the International Commission for 
the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna 
Commission (IATTC), should be on the basis of the relevance of the meeting as indicated by 
the agenda for that meeting.  
 
43. 
The Meeting noted issues relating to the actions necessary to implement the 
requirements of international instruments as set out in CCSBT/0104/16. Members agreed to 
consider these issues with their experts and to review them at the next meeting of the 
CCSBT. 
 
Agenda Item 8.3  
Meeting of FAO and non-FAO regional fishery bodies 
 
44. 
A written report on the meeting by the Executive Secretary was noted 
CCSBT/0104/07. 
 
Agenda Item 8.4  
IGO’s attendance at the scientific committee meetings 
 
45. 
The members agreed to work to be at a position to reach a decision on this matter at 
CCSBT8. 
 
Agenda Item 9. Total Allowable  Catch and its Allocation 
 
Agenda Item 9.1  
Total Allowable Catch 
 
46. 
The Commission noted the contribution the Scientific Research Program it had 
adopted at this meeting would make to the stock assessment process. New Zealand 
considered that there was no basis to support a change in TAC until the relevant scientific 
work identified in the Scientific Research Program had been carried out and incorporated in 
the stock assessment process. Japan considered that the SBT stock was moving in a 
favourable direction and that on the basis of their calculations it is reasonable to increase the 
TAC by 3000 tonnes to approximately 15 000 tonnes. Australia considered that a change to 
the TAC was premature. It believed it was important to support the work of the external 
scientists and to await the outcome of the SAG and the stock assessment before considering 
a change to the total allowable catch. 
 
47. 
The Commission was not able to set a TAC for 2001, however, it recognised that the 
2001 stock assessment process would be completed prior to CCSBT8 and would allow 
members to consider and adopt a TAC for 2002. 
 
Agenda Item 9.2  
National Allocation 
 
48. 
Australia and New Zealand indicated that in the absence of a TAC, they would 
maintain their national quota allocations, on a voluntary basis, at the levels last agreed by the 
Commission.  
 
49. 
Japan stated that although it would continue to apply voluntary restrictions it sought 
the Commissions' understanding to take into account the catch of 711 tonnes it had refrained 
from catching in 1999 following the provisional measures issued by the International Tribunal 
on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). It noted that these orders were subsequently revoked by the 
Arbitral Tribunal when it decided it did not have jurisdiction in the SBT dispute. New Zealand 
noted that the question of whether Japan was entitled to add 711 tonnes to its catch for 2001 
turned on different legal interpretations of the relevant part of the Arbitral Tribunal’s Award. 
In its view it would be unfortunate if Japan were to proceed without clarification of the legal 
questions involved. Australia noted that its previously stated legal position that Japan should 
not take up this tonnage, had not changed and in its view Japan should not undo those actions 
already undertaken under the ITLOS Provisional Measures.  
 
50. 
Japan stated that while it recognised its baseline of 6065 tonnes as a voluntary national 
allocation for 2001, it would seek understanding by Australia and New Zealand with regard to 
the increase of 711 tonnes through various appropriate channels. 
 
Agenda Item 10. Program of work for 2001-02 
 
Agenda Item10.1 
Date of next ERS Working Group meeting 
 
51. 
The ‘Draft Agenda CCSBT – Ecologically Related Species Working Group', was 
tabled. The Agenda was accepted by the Commission and is included at Attachment J.  
 
Agenda Item 10.2 
Other Meetings 
 
52. 
The Commission adopted a program of work for 2001, which is included at 
Attachment K.  
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Other business 
 
Agenda Item 11.1 
Executive Secretary Recruitment Process 
 
53. 
The Commission noted that this matter had been concluded at CCSBT 6(3). 
 
 
Agenda Item 11.2 
Appointment of Database Manager 
 
54. 
The Commission noted the advice from the Executive Secretary that Mr Robert 
Kennedy had been appointed to the position of Database Manager. 
 
Agenda Item 11.3 
Coordinating Input of Data to Database  
 
55. 
The Commission noted that this matter was included in the work plan for the SRP 
and would be further discussed as part of characterisation of SBT catch. 
 
Agenda Item 11.4 
Confidentiality of Commission documents 
 
56. 
The Commission considered the matter of confidentiality of reports of Commission 
meetings, reports of subsidiary or advisory bodies of the Commission and documents 
submitted to such meetings, and agreed to amend Rule 10 of the Commission’s Rules of 
Procedure.  The agreed amended Rule 10 is included at Attachment L. 
 
57. 
The Commission agreed that Rule 10 (as amended) would have effect from the 
close of the seventh annual meeting of the Commission, i.e. from 21 April 2001. 
 
58. 
The Commission noted there was a number of documents in existence prior to its 
agreement to amend Rule 10.  Commission Members agreed that such documents would be 
made available, on request, where both the author and the Member (if the author is a 
representative of a Member) had given permission for the document to be released. 
 
59. 
The Commission confirmed that the reports of prior Commission meetings, except 
for attached reports of subsidiary or advisory bodies, would be made publicly available. 
Commission Members agreed that prior reports of subsidiary or advisory bodies of the 
Commission would be made available, on request, when the permission of all Members had 
been granted. 
 
Other business 
 
Western and Central Pacific Fishery Convention (WCPFC) 
 
60. 
Japan expressed concern with the WCPFC which could significantly influence the 
SBT issues in the future, especially in its responsibility overlapping those of CCSBT, the 
decision making processes and dispute settlement mechanism, etc.  Japan also stressed that 
the current WCPFC went against the spirit of cooperation under Articles 64 and 118 of the 
UNCLOS and Article 8(3) of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. 
 
61. 
In response, New Zealand and Australia noted that the Convention adopted in the 
MHLC (the WCPFC) was the outcome of extended negotiation involving Pacific States and 
Distant Water Fishing Nations.  New Zealand and Australia advised that the first 
Preparatory Conference of the WCPFC would be held in Christchurch the following week, 
and understood that discussions were being held to ensure that issues that Japan had indicated 
were of concern to it could be discussed at the PrepCon.  New Zealand and Australia noted 
that the issue raised by Japan of overlapping jurisdiction in respect of SBT between the 
WCPFC and CCSBT mirrored the situation in other regional fisheries arrangements where 
the same distinction between a regionally based mandate and the species specific 
responsibilities of CCSBT for SBT also existed. 
 
62. 
Japan replied that it was impossible to proceed fair discussion for improvement of the 
WCPFC under circumstances of closed membership, and this makes it impossible for Japan 
to participate in the conference.  Japan also mentioned that at the MHLC7 it tried to have 
SBT excluded from the WCPFC jurisdiction.  Australia and New Zealand, however, 
opposed the exclusion of SBT from the Convention. 
 
Port ban 
 
63. 
Japan requested that Australia should open its ports to Japanese fishing vessels 
immediately for humanitarian, including medical checks and emergency reasons, and it 
explained the increase in incidents including death, after the unilateral ban on port access. 
 
64. 
In response, Australia advised that it attaches the highest importance to safety of life 
at sea, and in accordance with Australia’s international obligation, foreign fishing vessels may 
enter an Australian port without the need of a port permit in genuine cases of emergency. 
 
65. 
Australia also stated that it hoped that arrangements for port access to Australian 
ports for Japanese fishing vessels could be normalized in the near future.

Australia’s opening statement- CCSBT7 
 
 
Thank you Mr Chairman for your kind welcome and on behalf of Australia I would like 
to extend a warm welcome to all delegates and observers to the seventh annual meeting 
of CCSBT here in Sydney.  In particular, we welcome the delegates of Japan and New 
Zealand along with observers from the Republic of Korea, Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), the 
Republic of Indonesia and the Republic of South Africa. 
 
Australia would like to welcome Bill Mansfield of New Zealand to the Chair of the 
Commission and we are sure you will bring wisdom to the guidance of the work of the 
CCSBT. 
 
Our appreciation to Campbell McGregor for a job well done as Executive Secretary and 
our wishes go with him for the future either in retirement or in any other avenues of 
endeavour that he might pursue. 
 
Australia, along with the other Commission Members, was pleased with the 
announcements by the Republic of Korea and the Republic of Indonesia of their 
intention to accede to the 1993 Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna.  We look forward to the early completion of the domestic procedures relating to 
the accession process and the day when we can welcome both countries as full 
Members of the Commission. 
 
Australia continues to be committed to the successful operation of this Commission and 
through it, the long-term conservation and optimal utilisation of the global southern 
bluefin tuna stock.  For its part, Australia remains committed to the primacy of the 
CCSBT in developing, implementing and reviewing effective global arrangements for 
SBT. 
 
We would like to place on record our thanks to both the External Scientists and to the 
Member scientists of the CCSBT who have worked to bring forward a very credible 
SRP. This new era of cooperation and collaboration is appreciated and should be 
encouraged. 
 
There is much on the table to discuss at this meeting.  In particular, Australia would like 
the Commission’s deliberations to focus on: 
 
− 
Arriving at an agreement to and framework for implementation of the Scientific 
Research Program (SRP) amongst the CCSBT Members. 
 
− 
Confirming the stock assessment arrangements for 2001 to enable a Total 
Allowable Catch (TAC) of SBT to be set by the CCSBT for 2002 and in this 
context agreeing to TAC arrangements for 2001. 
 
− 
Reviewing the CCSBT Action Plan in relation to non-Members.  We must 
continue to emphasise the importance of encouraging the accession or formal 
cooperation of all SBT fishing states or entities.  Australia is keen to examine 
what further measures Commission Members should take to ensure adherence by 
non-Members to the Commission’s conservation and management measures and 
to deter SBT fishing activities that undermine the objective of the Commission. 
 
− 
Reviewing the status of the CCSBT Trade Information Scheme/Statistical 
Document Program (TIS) and gaining the agreement from all Commission 
Members and cooperating Non-Members to provide data at a similar level of 
detail to that required under. Trade Information Scheme (TIS).  In this context we 
are determined to pursue the External Scientists recommendations to gain better 
information on the catch of all parties fishing for SBT.  This will include regular 
reporting of all parties of their catch against their allocation through the fishing 
season. 
 
− 
Setting a date and venue for a meeting of the Ecologically Related Species 
Working Group in 2001. 
 
As I said at the outset Australia is committed to working cooperatively with the Chair 
and the other delegations to achieve the conservation and optimal utilisation of the 
global southern bluefin tuna fish stock. 
 
However having said that we are equally determined to see the work of the CCSBT 
move forward and to put the issues of the past clearly behind us.  In order to do that we 
seek the ongoing cooperation of all parties.

Opening Statement 
The 7 th Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
18 April 2001 
JAPAN 
 
Thank you, Chairman. 
 
Last August, the Arbitral Tribunal decided that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with 
the “southern bluefin tuna case”. Since then, issues relating to conservation and 
management of southern bluefin tuna have been discussed under the framework of the 
CCSBT with the cooperation and collaboration of member countries of CCSBT. I am 
pleased to note that progress has been made for improvement of the stock assessment 
process and non-member issues. 
 
The most urgent requirement for CCSBT is to agree upon an appropriate level of TAC 
through appropriate stock assessment procedures based upon scientific evidence. I am 
also pleased to note that improvement has been made for re-functioning of the CCSBT, 
including improvement of the stock assessment process. 
 
Especially, at the Fifth meeting of the Scientific Committee (SC), held last month in 
Tokyo, substantial progress was made for the establishment of an appropriate stock 
assessment and scientific research program. In this meeting, member countries will 
further discuss the result of the SC meeting. Japan highly respects the recommendations  
of the SC and is ready to discuss this issue. 
 
In this respect, Japan would like to express appreciation to the external scientists, 
independent chairs of the Scientific Committee and Stock Assessment Group for their 
initiatives and contributions toward improvement of the stock assessment and 
development of a scientific research program. Japan would like to ask their continued 
cooperation for further development of science within CCSBT. 
 
At the coming meeting of Stock Assessment Group (SAG), the first stock assessment 
will be conducted since the 1998 SAG meeting. Japan would like to stress that member 
countries should make the utmost effort to conduct an appropriate stock assessment of 
SBT, following the recommendations made by the SC. Member countries also should 
make the utmost effort to set a TAC for 2002 based upon the result of the assessment. 
 
On the other hand, progress also has been made in terms of non-member issues. For 
example, the Republic of Korea formally announced its intention for accession to the 
Convention for the Convention of Southern Bluefin Tuna.  
 
However, as a result of informal discussions with officials of the Government of Korea, 
it has become clear that the internal procedure of ROK for accession to the Convention 
has not shown  progress. 
 
I believe that the Commission needs to work further for ROK’s early accession to the 
Convention. 
 
It is regrettable that little progress has been made on the matter of other non-member’s 
accession to the Convention or cooperation with the CCSBT. It is necessary for the 
CCSBT to decide further action under the “ Action Plan ” in this meeting and to make 
further progress on this matter. 
 
As for the total allowable catch for 2001, Japan is planning to set a voluntary national 
allocation, taking into account the amount of catch which could not be used for 
commercial catch in 1999, because of the provisional measures prescribed by ITLOS 
which have already been revoked. 
 
Now, this year, Japan is the host country for SAG, SC and CCSBT8. 
 
SAG/SC will be held in Tokyo and CCSBT8 will be held in Miyako-city, Iwate 
Prefecture. Japan does hope that good progress will be made on various issues with 
cooperation and collaboration of member countries of CCSBT in these meetings as well 
as in this CCSBT7 meeting. Also, we hear that ROK which participates in this meeting 
still with observer status is now making every effort for early accession to the 
Convention. I do hope that ROK will participate in the CCSBT8 as a member country.  
 
Lastly, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Australian Government which 
hosts the meeting and the staff of the Secretariat of the CCSBT. Especially, I would like 
to express my thanks to Mr. Campbell McGregor, current Executive Secretary of the 
CCSBT, for his long term work for the CCSBT. I hope his future will be prosperous. 
 
Thank you.

NEW ZEALAND OPENING STATEMENT 
 
 
Good morning ladies and gentlemen. We are looking forward to working with the 
delegations from Australia and Japan under the guidance of our new chairs, Bill 
Mansfield. We also extend a warm welcome to the representatives from Taiwan and 
South Africa who are with us today as well as Korea as member-designate. 
 
We are pleased with the progress we made at our last meeting, particularly with regards 
to steps that were taken in relation the SRP and to non-members. 
 
Since our last meetings much progress has been achieved. The external scientists have 
developed draft SRP that was discussed by the Scientific Committee. All members of 
the SC meeting at their last meeting accepted a final draft of the Scientific Research 
Programme proposal without reservation. We would like to acknowledge the effort 
made by the scientific delegation and the externals over the past few months to put the 
SRP together. It is now our duty to ensure that the SRP is adopted by the Commission 
and successfully implemented. We feel strongly that will be a critical step in ensuring 
the effective management and conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna stocks. 
 
As noted earlier we are also especially pleased with the progress that has been made 
regarding non-members. Korea’s formal announcement of its intention to become a 
member of the Commission was very good news. We look forward to Korea finalising 
the accession process to that it can become a full member of the Commission.   
 
As recognised by all parties, restraint of non-member catch will contribute to an 
improved potential for stock rebuild. For this reason we need to continue negotiations 
with other non-members to determine the steps required to achieve closer co-operation. 
 
We are confident that in the next few days we will build on the progress we achieved at 
out last meeting and we look forward to a successful outcome from our discussions. 
 
We also would like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank Mr Campbell 
McGregor for the his contribution to the CCSBT during the past few years. 
 
Thank you.

Seventh Commission Meeting 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
Sydney, Australia, 18-21 Apr., 2001 
 
Statement by the Republic of Korea 
 
CCSBT Opening Statement 
Pyung-Shik Shin  
Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Republic of Korea 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, and ladies and gentlemen. 
 
Good morning. 
 
On behalf of my delegation, I thank Mr. Chairman and all CCSBT Member States for 
inviting the Korean delegation to this Commission meeting, and I’d like to extend our 
sincere appreciation to the Secretary and all the staff members for the successful 
arrangements of this important meeting. 
 
It is frequently said that the fisheries management incorporates political, social, and 
economic conditions, on top of the scientific stock assessment.  This preposition can 
be best used only when there are enough fish resources at sea.   
 
During the last several decades, hundreds of famous fisheries have been collapsed 
worldwide, and even the abundance and fish size of the remained fisheries resources 
require special care.  With the large-scale variability of climate changes, overfishing 
has been one of the critical factors that control the stock conditions in commercial fish 
species.  Especially in tuna fisheries, both gr owth and recruitment overfishing can 
significantly impact on the remaining stocks.  In this respect, and for the sustainable 
exploitation of one of our food resources, various precautionary activities that the 
CCSBT promotes, including the Scientific Research Program, seems very timely and 
appropriate.   
 
As one of the fishing states, Korea has already recognized the importance of the 
resources exploitation through the adequate conservation and management of the 
fisheries resources.  Therefore, it has cooperated with the efforts of the world fisheries 
organizations by reducing fishing fleet size, eliminating IUU fishing, joining regional 
fisheries organizations, etc.  According to our policies, Korea will also cooperate with 
the management, sustainability, and optimum exploitation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna 
resources, based on an objective and reasonable interpretation of the best scientific 
information available.   
 
For the accession to the Convention, Korea delivered the Formal Letter of Intention to 
the Secretariat of the CCSBT last January that it will become a full member of the 
CCSBT, and the Korean government has made all our efforts to progress relevant 
domestic procedures as was scheduled.  In this regard, the Korean delegation would 
like to have an informal meeting with the member states to discuss on the issues 
remained. 
 
Once again, I thank for your generosity and long endurance for Korea to be one of your 
collaborative colleagues and I promise that Korea will address and discern various 
questions  on the Stakeholders’ interests in a fair and reasonable way, and will cooperate 
with all CCSBT activities for the common benefits of the Members and for the 
conservation and optimum exploitation of Southern Bluefin Tuna resources. 
 
I hope this meeting will have a fruitful outcome after our four days’ devotion and fever.  
Thanks.

OPENING STATEMENT BY TAIWAN 
 
April 18, 2001 
 
Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
First of all, on behalf of the Taiwan delegation, I would like to express our gratitude to 
the CCSBT Secretariat for inviting us to participate in this meeting. 
 
We fully understand that CCSBT has dedicated to managing southern bluefin tuna for 
many years.   We appreciate very much its efforts taken by the three existing 
Contracting Parties to the Convention.  As a responsible deep-sea fishing nation, we 
are conscious of the need for international cooperation on the conservation and 
management of tuna resources in the region.  For sustainable utilization of southern 
bluefin tuna, my government has made its best efforts to cooperate with CCSBT since 
its establishment in 1994. 
 
As you are aware, over the past several years, we have taken many measures in 
compliance with the resolutions adopted by CCSBT in spite that Taiwan is not a 
member to date.  The measures include, but not limited to enacting domestic 
regulations to implement the resolutions, imposing a self-restraint catch limit, providing 
catch statistics, participating in scientific research on southern bluefin tuna.  I believe 
our efforts will be respected from all SBT fishing nations concerned.  
 
In various occasions, we have repeatedly expressed that obligation of a fishing nation 
should be commensurate with its right.  We have also expressed that we have the 
strong willingness to participate as a member on an equal basis as other members in 
CCSBT.  CCSBT organized a delegation to visit Taipei last October, and thoroughly 
exchanged views with us on a new proposal presented by CCSBT to accommodate 
Taiwan in the regime.   We thank the efforts by CCSBT, although the agreement has 
not yet been reached so far.  My government is prudently evaluating the CCSBT’s 
proposal because of its complicated nature and involvement in our domestic legal and 
political circumstances.  What Taiwan intends to secure is an equal status and full 
participation as other parties to the Convention in the CCSBT regime.   It is hoped that 
Taiwan and CCSBT may continue to negotiate to find out a suitable resolution 
acceptable by both sides. 
 
Finally, we look forward to having a productive week during which we can resolve 
substantial issues and reach fruitful results.  My delegation appreciates very much for 
the codsiderate arrangement and hospitality extended by the Secretariat.

Review of the Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery 
for the 1999/00 and Preliminary 2000/01 Seasons 
Prepared by Carolyn Robins, BRS (10 April 2001) 
 
1. 
Introduction 
The Australian domestic SBT preliminary catch during the 1999/00 season (1 December 1999 
to 30 November 2000) was 5257 tonnes. The preliminary 2000/01 catch (1 December 2000 to 
30 November 2001) reported by 11 April 2001 is 5160 tonnes.  
2. 
Operational Constraints on Effort 
Regulatory Measures 
Domestic operators are managed through individual transferable quotas (ITQs) granted as 
Statutory Fishing Rights (SFRs) under the Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery Management 
Plan 1995. Although the global total allowable catch (TAC) has not been determined by the 
Commission since 1998, Australia agreed to maintain its national catch limit at 5265 tonnes, 
which has remained unchanged since 1989/90. 
3. 
Catch and Effort 
The SBT landings for the 1999/00 season were: 
South Australia  
5143 tonnes (5130 t in farm cages and 13 t longlined)  
and Western Australia  
New South Wales 
 
114 tonnes  
and Tasmania  
SBT caught for fish farms in South Australia, using purse seine vessels, utilise most of the 
Australian quota (3% in 1991/92 to over 97% in 1999/00). The domestic longlining component 
declined from 10% in 1996/97 to less than 3% in 1999/00. There were no SBT poled off South 
Australia or trolled off Tasmania during the 1999/00 season. 
The majority of the catches reported by April 2001 for the 2000/01 season come from the farm 
sector in South Australia. The season continues until 30 November 2001.  
4. 
Historical Catch and Effort 
Major restructuring occurred in Australia’s SBT fisheries following reductions in the global 
TAC and national catch allocations in the late 1980s. Attachment A summarises the catch 
taken by each sector of the Australian industry since 1988/89. Confidentiality guidelines prevent 
the release of data from groups of less than 5 boats. Therefore, data are combined for some 
fishing methods.   
5. 
Annual Fleet Size and Distribution 
Fishing for SBT, by eight purse seine vessels, for the farm operations in South Australia 
components commenced in December 1999 and continued until March 2000. Some longlining 
also occurred in South Australia (2 vessels), Tasmania (2 vessels) and Western Australia (18 
vessels). Longline fishing off New South Wales (37 vessels) commenced in May 2000 and 
continued until November.  
During the 2000/01 season eight purse seine vessels caught fish for the Port Lincoln tuna farms. 
Fishing started in December and most of the available quota had been caught by March 2001.  
6. 
Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
Australians began fishing for SBT in the early 1950s off New South Wales and South Australia 
and then later (1970) off Western Australia. The Australian catch peaked at 21 500 tonnes in 
1982. Historically, the bulk of the Australian catch had been used for canning.  
The introduction of an ITQ based management plan in 1984 based on an Australian TAC of 
14 500 tonnes resulted in the redistribution of quota ownership. Progressively over the mid to 
late 1980s, the Australian catch focussed on supplying the Japanese sashimi market, with an 
increasing amount of the catch being transhipped to Japanese freezer vessels in the Great 
Australian Bight. 
In the late 1980s the Australian quota reductions to 5265 tonnes led to further restructuring. 
From 1990 to 1994 approximately half the Australian quota was taken by Australia-Japan joint 
venture longliners. With the termination of the joint venture arrangement in 1995 Australian 
catches again focused on the surface fishery with poling operations supplying the fresh chilled 
sashimi market and purse seiners providing SBT to farms. 
Since 1992 there has been a progressive increase in the number of SBT taken for farming 
operations. In the 1999/00 season this component utilised over 97% the Australian quota 
resulting in quota being less available for other operations. 
7. 
Fisheries Monitoring 
The monitoring arrangements in the SBT fishery continue to be reviewed and refined in order 
to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the procedures. To prevent the incidental bycatch 
of SBT off NSW, operators with insufficient quota were prohibited from operating in the zone 
south of Sydney from June to August 2000. The catch disposal records, including one designed 
to cater for farm operations, were readily adopted in 1999/00. During the 1999/00 and 2000/01 
seasons AFMA Compliance Officers were deployed on farm tow vessels to observe 
procedures and protocols. These operations will continue in future seasons. In addition, farm 
monitoring procedures are reviewed annually with boat inspections while in port and the 
monitoring of all transfers of fish to farm cages continuing. The AFMA Compliance Program 
also introduced an ongoing audit of fishing records in 2000/01.  
 
 
8. 
Other factors  
Import/Export Statistics 
The Trade Information Scheme that records all exported Australian fish has been implemented 
and refined. This program will provide a complete record of SBT exports that can be compared 
with the Japanese Import Statistics.  
Markets 
More than 95% of Australia’s SBT catch is exported to Japan.

Review of Southern Bluefin Tuna Fisheries of Japan in 1999 Fishing Season 
 
1. Summery 
(1) 
In the 1999 fishing season (1 March 1999 - 29 February 2000), fishing for SBT by 
Japanese fishing vessels started on 15 April 1999 and terminated on 1 December 
1999.  The total Catch during the fishing season was 5,354tons. 
(2) 
Japanese distant-water tuna longline fishing, including fishing for SBT, faces a 
severe economic situation due to a decline in demand for tuna because of the long 
recession in Japan and a fall in the price of tuna caused by increased import of 
tuna. 
 
2. Catch Control 
(1) 
The Government of Japan (GOJ) took voluntary measures to set an upper limit of 
catch (6,065tons), which was the Japanese national allocation agreed by CCSBT 
in 1997, and established a fishing plan for the 1999 fishing season. Japanese 
industry operated into fishing activity in accordance with the plan.  However, in 
accordance with provisional measures prescribed by ITOLS, GOJ decreased the 
upper limit in the mid of the fishing season. 
(2) 
GOJ issued a notification to the industry, which ordered it to comply with the plan. 
The plan divided the fishing area into three (3) sub-fishing areas (high seas area 
off Tasmania/Sydney, high seas area off Cape Town and Southern Indian Ocean), 
and put the vessels under obligations to report to GOJ the date of entry to and 
departure from each sub-fishing area, and report to GOJ catch information every 
10 days. GOJ also established closed seasons for each sub-fishing area for the 
purpose of protecting spawning stocks and juvenile stocks, etc. 
(3) 
GOJ took necessary measures to control and monitor the fishery, which include 
dispatching enforcement vessels to the fishing area, observers on board of 
operating vessels, as well as requirement for fishing vessels to install VMS on 
board vessels and to report a daily position to GOJ. 
 
3. Catch and Effort 
In the 1999 fishing season, GOJ took voluntary measures to set an upper limit of 
6,065 tons, which was agreed as the national allocation to Japan in 1997, in the 
absence of a decision on TAC by the Commission.  Actual catch in 1999 fishing 
season was 5,354tons, reducing 711tons from the catch limit, in accordance with 
provisional measures prescribed by ITLOS. The breakdown of the actual catch was as 
follows; 
- 
high seas off Tasmania/Sydney 
 
1,539tons 
- 
high seas off Cape Town   
 
2,513tons 
- 
Southern Indian Ocean 
 
 
1,113tons 
- 
Other areas including South Africa’s EEZ 
189tons.   
 
4. Past Catch and Effort 
The catch limits planned and actual catches for recent 3 years are shown in 
Attachment 1. 
(1) 
The actual catch in 1996 exceeded the plan by 308tons. As the result, GOJ 
placed under its control a total of 5,757tons (i.e. the national allocation in 1997 
(6,065tons) minus 308tons) of SBT as the catch limit for the 1997 fishing season. 
The actual catch was within the catch limit. 
(2) 
In the 1998 fishing season, GOJ took voluntary measures to set an upper limit of 
6,065 tons, which was agreed as national allocation to Japan in 1997, in the 
absence of a decision on TAC by the Commission. The actual catch in 1998 was 
within the catch limit. 
 
5. Total Number of Fishing Vessels and Their Distribution 
The number of fishing vessels targeting SBT in the 1999 fishing season was 227.  
The number of vessels on the high seas off Tasmania/Sydney was 69, the number of 
vessels on the high seas off Cape Town was 99, and the number of vessels in Southern 
Indian Ocean was 59. 
 
6. Past Fishing Vessel Numbers and Their Distribution 
Vessel numbers and their distribution to sub-fishing areas for recent 3 years are shown 
in Attachment 1. 
 
The total number of fishing vessels targeting SBT in 1998 fishing season was 257. 
However, Japan reduced the number by 30, following a voluntary reduction of 
numbers of Japanese distant-water tuna longline fishing vessels by 20%.  
 
7. Monitoring 
(1) 
In the 1999 fishing season, the number of observers on board was 20 and a total 
observed days were 1,033 days. 
(2) 
During the same period, Japan dispatched 5 enforcement vessels to the fishing 
area of SBT for a total of 576 days. 
 
8. Others  
(The amount of import of SBT to Japan) 
The amount of import of SBT to Japan is shown in Attachment 2. 
The import of SBT to Japan has increased steadily every year, and has more than 
doubled over these 5 years (1995-1999).  The drastic increase was caused by the 
increase in imports from Australia, Korea and Taiwan.  Imports in 1999 totaled 
10,600tons.  The biggest exporting country is Australia (66% of the total volume 
imported.).  The major exporters (Australia, Korea and Taiwan) account for 91% of 
the total volume.

Review of Southern Bluefin Tuna Fisheries of Japan in 2000 Fishing Season 
 
1. Summery 
(1) 
In the 2000 fishing season (1 March 2000 - 29 February 2001), fishing for SBT by 
Japanese fishing vessels started on 15 April 2000 and terminated on 27 December 
2000. 
(2) 
Experimental fishing was conducted by two research vessels from 1 August to 31 
August 2000. This experiment was conducted within an upper limit of SBT catch 
voluntarily established by the Government of Japan (GOJ). 
(3) 
Japanese distant-water tuna longline fishing, including fishing for SBT, faces a 
severe economic situation due to a decline in demand for tuna because of the long 
recession in Japan and a fall in the price of tuna caused by increased import of 
tuna. 
 
2. Catch Control 
(1) 
GOJ originally took voluntary measures to set an upper limit of catch (4,578tons) 
in accordance with the provisional measures prescribed by ITOLS (“Japanese 
national allocation agreed by CCSBT in 1997 (6,065tons)” - “amount of SBT 
caught by 1999 EFP (2,198tons - 711tons)”). However, since the provisional 
measures were revoked by the arbitral tribunal on 4 August 2000, GOJ changed 
the upper limit to 6,065tons. 
(2) 
GOJ issued a notification to the industry, which ordered it to comply with the plan. 
The plan divided the fishing area into three (3) sub-fishing areas (high seas area 
off Tasmania/Sydney, high seas area off Cape Town and Southern Indian Ocean), 
and put the vessels under obligations to report to GOJ the date of entry to and 
departure from each sub-fishing area, and report to GOJ catch information every 
10 days. GOJ also established closed seasons for each sub-fishing area for the 
purpose of protecting spawning stocks and juvenile stocks, etc. 
(3) 
GOJ took necessary measures to control and monitor the fishery, which include 
dispatching enforcement vessels to the fishing area, observers on board of 
operating vessels, as well as requirement for fishing vessels to install VMS on 
board vessels and to report a daily position to GOJ. 
 
3. Catch and Effort 
In the 2000 fishing season, GOJ originally took voluntary measures to set an upper 
limit of 4,578tons in accordance with the provisional measures prescribed by ITOLS 
(see 2.(1) above), and established a fishing plan with this upper limit.  However, 
since the provisional measures were revoked by the arbitral tribunal, GOJ changed the 
upper limit to 6,065tons and modified the fishing plan in accordance with the changed 
of the upper limit. 
 
4. Past Catch and Effort 
Catch and effort by Japanese fishing vessels for recent 3 year are shown in 
Attachment 1. 
(1) 
In the 1998 fishing season, GOJ took voluntary measures to set an upper limit of 
6,065 tons, which was agreed as national allocation to Japan in 1997, in the 
absence of a decision on TAC by the Commission. The actual catch in 1998 was 
6,038tons. 
(2) 
In the 1999 fishing season, GOJ originally took the same voluntary measures as 
1998 fishing season, in the absence of a decision on TAC by the Commision.  
However, following the prescription of provisional measures by ITLOS, actual 
catch in 1999 was 5,354tons.  711tons of SBT were not utilized for fishing. 
 
5. Total Number of Fishing Vessels and Their Distribution 
The number of fishing vessels targeting SBT in the 2000 fishing season was 199.  
The number of vessels on the high seas off Tasmania/Sydney was 52, the number of 
vessels on the high seas off Cape Town was 75, and the number of vessels in Southern 
Indian Ocean was 72.  For this fishing season, the provisional measures by ITLOS 
and their revocation within the season adversely affected the fishing planning.  As 
the result, the number of fishing vessels decreased compared to the previous season. 
 
6. Past Fishing Vessel Numbers and Their Distribution 
Vessel numbers and their distribution to sub-fishing areas for recent 3 years are shown 
in Attachment 1. 
 
The total number of fishing vessels targeting SBT in 1998 fishing season was 257. 
However, in the 1999 fishing season, Japan reduced the number by 30 vessels, 
following a voluntary reduction of numbers of Japanese distant-water tuna longline 
fishing vessels by 20%.  
 
7. Monitoring 
(1) 
In the 2000 fishing season, the number of observers on board was 12 and a total 
observed days were 867 days. 
(2) 
During the same period, Japan dispatched 4 enforcement vessels to the fishing 
area of SBT for a total of 447 days. 
 
8. Others  
(The amount of import of SBT to Japan) 
The amount of import of SBT to Japan is shown in Attachment 2. 
(1) 
From 1993 to 1998, amount of SBT imported to Japan had significantly 
increased.  Since 1998, it seems that the amount of imported SBT has stabilized 
around just over 10,000tons (product weight). 
(2) 
Import of SBT in 2000 tabled 10,356tons (product weight).  Import from the 
biggest 5 exporting country/entities (1 Australia, 2 Taiwan, 3 Republic of Korea, 
4 New Zealand, 5 Indonesia) account for 99.6% of the total. 
(3) 
Import from Australia, the biggest export of SBT to Japan has increased its 
export of SBT steadily, reaching 7,831tons (product weight).  This amount of 
SBT accounts for 75.6% of the total import of SBT to Japan.

Review of New Zealand SBT Fisheries for CCSBT–7 
 
1. 
Introduction 
Three fishing methods are used to target SBT in the EEZ.  By far, most fishing effort is 
with surface longlining although a small amount of fishing is still done by trolling and 
handlining.  The domestic fishery is composed of a wide range of vessel types including a 
variable number of small owner-operated boats and 4–5 low temperature freezer longliners 
chartered by a New Zealand company that otherwise are part of the Japanese distant 
water fleet.  Both the chartered vessels and the New Zealand owner-operated vessels fish 
competitively against New Zealand’s SBT catch allocation of 420 tonnes. 
As is typical in most seasons, most fishing for SBT in 1999–00 was conducted off the west 
coast of the South Island and the northeast coast of the North Island.  Landing statistics 
indicate an over catch of the adjusted national allocation in 1999–00.  As a result, the 
regulations controlling catch for New Zealand will be modified and the SBT catch 
correspondingly reduced for the 2000/01 fishing year. 
2. 
Operational constraints on effort 
 
Voluntary measures 
The domestic fishing industry has undertaken a number of voluntary measures with respect 
to longline fishing first set out in a “Code of Practice” in April 1994.  Specific measures 
include gear specifications, environmental standards, suggested operational practices and 
closed areas.  While the measures are voluntary their intent is to minimize: 
• bycatch (eg of seabirds and marine mammals); 
• catch of SBT smaller than 20 kg; 
• impacts on other domestic tuna fisheries, and 
• gear conflict among SBT longline vessels. 
Other voluntary measures employed by specific sectors include catch limits by area, 
changing areas when bird bycatch reaches a specific level, using multiple “tori” lines and 
longer lines than specified in regulations as the minimum, night-setting, and the use of 
pneumatic “bird-scaring” cannons. 
 
Regulatory measures 
New Zealand continues to impose the previously agreed national catch limit of 420 tonnes 
(whole weight).  This catch limit is a competitive limit among all license holders.  
Regulations specify the annual catch limit and make it an offence to take SBT once the 
 
2 
catch limit has been reached.  The catch limit applies within and outside New Zealand 
fisheries waters for the “fishing year” which extends from 1 October to 30 September and 
applies to the catch of both southern and northern bluefin tunas (Thunnus maccoyii and T. 
orientalis).  In the few instances when the catch limit has been exceeded, it has been 
reduced in the following year by an equivalent amount. 
3. 
Catch and Effort 
 
New Zealand catches of SBT in whole weight have averaged about 280 tonnes per year 
over the last 14 years.  Catches are summarised by calendar year and fishing year (1 
October to 30 September) in Table 1.  The trend in catches over this period has been 
increasing (see Figure 1) and corresponds to an increase in domestic longline effort since 
1990.  Longline effort has dominated the New Zealand fishery for the past decade and 
catches by handline and trolling are minor components of the New Zealand SBT fishery.  
Figure 2 shows the effort trend (in millions of hooks) for the longline fishery from 1989 to 
1999.  It is clear from this figure that the increase in effort is attributable to the growing 
number of New Zealand owned and operated longliners. 
4. 
Annual fleet size and distribution 
 
The New Zealand longline fleet has broadened its area of operation and now fishes most 
areas of the east and west coasts of both the North and South Islands.  Total fleet size is 
about 160 vessels of mostly small to medium size, there are only a few longliners equivalent 
to the Japanese distant water fleet. 
 
SBT target fishing by longline primarily occurs off the west coast of the South Island and 
off the North Island off East Cape and the Mahia peninsula.  SBT also comprises a 
significant bycatch in the bigeye target fishery in the Bay of Plenty. 
5. 
Historical fleet size and distribution 
 
The New Zealand SBT fishery began off the west coast of the South Island as a winter 
small boat handline fishery in the early 1980s.  This fleet now comprises only a minor 
component of the fishery.  During this same period most longlining was conducted by 
foreign licensed longliners from Japan.  However, declining catch rates, shortened seasons 
of availability and reports of increased operating costs in the EEZ resulted in this fleet 
ceasing its operations in the mid-1990s.  The rise of domestic longline fishing began in 1991 
and regularly increased up to at least 2000. 
6. 
Fisheries Monitoring 
 
Observer coverage  
Observer coverage has been 100% in the charter fleet for several years.  However, owing 
to the small size of domestic owned and operated vessels and frequent short trips, the 
Ministry of Fisheries (MFish) has had difficulty placing observers in this fleet.  As a 
consequence, observer coverage has typically been low.  In 1999–00 approximately half of 
 
3 
the total SBT catch was observed.  Recent realignment of MFish observer allocation 
should result in a substantial increase in coverage of domestic owned and operated longline 
vessels from 2000–01.  Observer coverage on vessels fishing by handline or trolling has not 
been done.  The reason for this is because these methods are not used in all years, they 
contribute to only a small portion of the SBT catch and it has not been possible to determine 
in advance of a fishing trip whether handlining or trolling would be used. 
 
RTMP coverage 
MFish operates an in-season catch monitoring system for SBT.  This system requires that 
on-shore processing companies and freezer vessels (including all of the chartered fleet) 
report catch by e-mail or fax on a weekly basis to MFish.  Daily reporting is required once 
a trigger point is reached.  The trigger point was formerly 75% of the catch allocation but 
has now been lowered to 25%.  Reports are collated by MFish and if catch reports indicate 
that the limit is going to be met, all SBT permit holders are notified that the catch limit has 
been taken and that it would be an offence to take southern bluefin for the balance of the 
fishing year.  
 
Biological information 
Observers from the MFish Scientific Observer Programme are responsible for collecting a 
range of biological data on SBT and fish bycatch.  In 1999–00 otoliths were collected from 
149 SBT and four tagged SBT were recovered by observers.  Otoliths are stored at 
NIWA and tag recovery data were provided to the tagging agency (CSIRO).  Tissue 
samples were collected from SBT, fish identified as northern bluefin tuna and from 
swordfish.  Swordfish samples were collected for scientists at NRIFSF while the 
remaining samples were collected for NIWA scientists as part of a project funded by 
MFish.  In addition length, weight (both processed and whole weights) and sex are 
recorded regularly for SBT and major fish bycatch species. 
7. 
Other factors 
 
Import/export statistics 
Statistics on the export of SBT are compiled by Customs and summarized by the 
Department of Statistics.  Export statistics are further summarized by the New Zealand 
Seafood Industry Council and maintained as a database for economic evaluations of New 
Zealand fisheries.   
 
Markets 
The only market for SBT caught in the EEZ is the Japanese sashimi market and all fish of 
suitable quality are exported.  Domestic consumption is negligible.   
 
Mitigation 
 
4 
New Zealand regulations specify that all tuna longline vessels are required to use seabird-
scaring devices.  The minimum standard for these, is the same as specified by CCAMLR 
for “tori lines”.  The domestic fishing industry has a voluntary code of practice advocating 
night setting for all tuna longlines and for the large tuna longline vessels a limit on total 
incidental mortality of “at risk” seabirds has been set.   Large tuna longliners have had 
100% observer coverage in recent years.

Review of the Korean SBT Fishery 
 
Doo-Hae Ahn 
National Fisheries Research and Development Institute 
The Republic of Korea 
 
 
The fishery 
 
   The Korean longline fishery for SBT began its operation in the southern Indian 
Ocean in 1991. Until 1995, the number of longliners was 1-3 vessels annually, followed 
by an increase to 8 vessels in 1996 and further to 19 in 1998.  However, 16 longliners 
operated in 2000 (Table 1).   
   At the early stage of this fishery, some vessels fishing for tropical tunas moved to 
the southern Indian Ocean to fish for SBT. Therefore, fishing activities by these vessels 
were limited to only a few months out of the year. During 1991-1993, the longliners 
operated for five to six months each year, with 40-80 mt of SBT catch per vessel. In 
recent years, operations have increased to almost year round, which resulted in the catch 
of 100-150 mt per vessel. 
   Annual catch of SBT has continuously increased since 1992. The 1998 catch of SBT 
by Korean longliners was 1,562 mt, showing roughly an increase of 18% , compared 
with the previous year. This increase was directly related with the increase of longliners, 
from 14 in 1997 to 19 in 1998.  However, catches of SBT gradually decreased after 
1998, and catches in 1999 and 2000 were 1,271 mt and 980 mt, respectively.  The 
reduction of the catch in 2000 was due to the reduction of the fleet size from the 
industry’s voluntary coordination. 
 
Species composition and catch per unit effort 
 
  Species composition of the longline fishery shows that SBT comprised 95.2% of the 
total catch in 1999. The remaining 4.8% constituted bigeye, yellowfin, swordfish and 
other species including billfishes (Table 2). 
   Catch per unit effort (CPUE), as [no. ind./1,000 hooks], was increased from 1.8 in 
1992 to 8.4 in 1994, and then decreased to 5.7 next year. In 1996 and 1997, it was 
around 4.0 fish/1,000 hooks, and then decreased to 3.4 and 3.2 in 1998 and 1999, 
respectively (Table 1). 
   Fish sizes (fork length) of SBT, collected by National Fisheries Research and 
Development Institute (NFRDI) from fishing vessels, ranged from 78 to 197cm (an 
average of 146.6cm), of which 50% of the total fish measured on board by fishermen 
was 145-160cm in fork length.  
 
Fishing grounds 
 
   The fishing area is broad but largely divided into two regions. Until 1993, most 
fishing operations were concentrated on the southeastern part of the Indian Ocean, while 
in 1994 and afterwards some longliners extended their operation to the southwestern 
waters off the southern tip of Africa, and further to the southeastern Atlantic Ocean later.   
However, fishing activities have generally concentrated on the areas between 35-45°S 
and 90-120°E, 30-45°S and 0-60°E. Higher CPUE distribution was shown in the 
southwestern part of the Indian ocean off the southern tip of South Africa.   
 
Research 
 
   Researches on tuna and tuna-like species by the National Fisheries Research and 
Development Institute (NFRDI) focus on tuna fisheries and biology based on catch, 
effort, and length frequency data collected from fishing vessels. Those data were 
compiled and reported to the international fisheries organizations including the CCSBT.

Review of Taiwan SBT Fishery of 1999/2000  
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Taiwan has traditionally been fishing for southern bluefin tuna (SBT) since 
1970s.  The fish was caught partly by seasonal directed fishery and partly by 
albacore/bigeye fisheries as a by-catch.  Directed fishery was conducted mainly 
by longliners equipped with super cold freezers, fishing in two seasons in the 
waters around 35°S.  However no year-round target fishery has yet been 
developed. 
The total annual catch in 1999 was 1,787 mt, among which 1,513 mt were 
in frozen form, caught by deep-sea longliners, and the others were in fresh form 
probably from those small longliners that have entered into fisheries cooperation 
with Indonesia.  The accumulated catch in 2000 was preliminarily estimated to 
be 1,689 mt, with 1,448 mt in frozen form and 241 mt in fresh form. 
2. OPERATIONAL CONSTRANITS ON EFFORT 
Though Taiwan is not a member of CCSBT, to conserve the stock and to 
cooperate with CCSBT in freezing the SBT catch at the 1995 level as 
recommended by the Commission in 1995, a voluntary catch limit of 1,450 mt 
was imposed in 1996.  Annual SBT catch will be maintained to this level 
thereafter, unless the stock has recovered or for other reasons Taiwan deems 
appropriate. 
To gather more SBT catch information promptly and to manage the total 
SBT catch under the self-regulated level, every vessel that has caught SBT was 
required to report weekly its SBT catches in weight and fishing location (Weekly 
Report) to the fishery authorities from 1996 onward.  Trading information on 
SBT product was also collected through the subscription of certified weight 
reports of Shin Nippon Kentai Kaisha as from 1994.  The catch data from 
 
 
Weekly Reports were crosschecked with this trading information to reduce the 
possibility of non-reporting.   
CCSBT has adopted the Trade Information Scheme during its 6 th 
commission meeting in November of 1999.  Measures for issuing SBT 
Statistical Document to fishermen have been implemented since June of 2000 to 
fulfill the requirement of the scheme. 
3. ANNUAL CATCHES 
SBT was mainly a by-catch of Taiwan tuna fishery in the past, and since the 
development of super-cold freezers, some vessels equipped with such freezing 
capacity started to operate seasonally directed fishing on the species during 
recent years.  Historically, annual catches of SBT were smaller than 250 mt 
during early 1980s, but, due to the increase of tuna fleet size, developing of deep 
longliners, and expanding of fishing ground, the catches were increased 
thereafter.  From 1989 onward, the SBT catches increased to a tonnage of 
more than 1,000 mt, where drift net fishery accounted for about 1/4 of the 
catches in 1989 and 1990.  After then, the SBT catches did not continue to 
increase, but rather fluctuate between 800 and 1,700 mt. 
4. FLEET SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION 
SBT was caught only by longline fishery after 1993 in the three oceans with 
the majority in the Indian Ocean.   According to the weekly reports and trading 
information, during 1998-2000 about 130 deep sea longliners reported and to 
have landed frozen form SBT, and most of them were operating in the Indian 
Ocean.  There were also some small longliners operating in the Indonesian and 
adjacent waters and to have landed fish in fresh form.  During the same period, 
there were altogether about 600 longliners operating the three oceans, with more 
than 55% in the Indian Ocean.   
Similar to the previous years, SBT catches were mainly made in the waters 
of 20°S - 40°S, which was due more to the north than the traditionally known 
fishing ground.  Seasonally, the SBT catch was mainly made in the southern and 
central Indian Ocean during June to September, and in the southern and western 
Indian Ocean extending to the eastern limit of the Atlantic Ocean during October 
to February of the following year. 
 
 
5. FISHERIES MONITORING 
For better understanding and monitoring the fishery, more efforts have been 
exerted since the implementation of TIS to collect more updated and detailed 
catch information.  Since this year, provision of daily records in the Weekly 
Report was required for obtaining a SBT statistical document. 
Since 1997, collaborative work with scientists from CSIRO on field visit 
and sampling of SBT catch were conducted in Mauritius, with the most recent 
one in September 2000.  We welcome such joint work to improve the 
understanding of SBT fishery. 
A project for the development of vessel monitoring system (Inmarsat-C) 
incorporated with the function of logbook transmission was established recently.  
Initial development of the system was completed and experiments were 
successfully carried out on 12 vessels operating on the high seas.  Further 
studies and pilot applications on deep sea longliners were still ongoing.  
6. OTHER FACTORS 
Mitigation on seabirds issue 
Taiwan is willing to cooperate with CCSBT through information exchange to 
improve understanding of the interaction between fishing operation and seabirds 
catch.  To reduce incidental seabirds mortality, fishermen were subsidized to 
use tori lines.  Education program was continuously made through Tuna 
Association to increase the understanding of the seabird issue among fishermen, 
including distribution of educational pamphlets in Chinese translation ‘Catching 
fish, not bird’ and training on application of tori lines.

REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CCSBT 
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROGRAM 
 
 
 
The acceptance by the CCSBT of a comprehensive Scientific Research Program (SRP) 
proposal to guide CCSBT research activities over the next few years represents substantial 
progress towards resolving problems that have hindered assessment of the SBT resource over 
the past few years.   While it is certainly necessary to initiate research activities under this 
SRP without delay, it is also important to ensure that major SRP components, particularly 
multi-national tagging and observer programs, are correctly planned and implemented, to 
maximise their success. 
 
SRP implementation activities during the remainder of 2001 should therefore focus on 
preparatory work towards detailed planning by specific technical or research meetings in late 
2001 and early 2002.  Considering the limited time remaining in 2001, it is also important that 
SRP implementation activities this year should not detract from preparatory work for the 
forthcoming SAG meeting.  Conducting an effective assessment of the SBT resource remains 
the main priority for 2001. 
 
The SRP implementation activities proposed below are primarily intended to be conducted 
between May 2001 and the CCSBT8 meeting.  Further detailed workplans for 2002 will be 
developed during technical workshops and the remaining 2001 SAG and SC meetings.  
However, to provide an indication of the main SRP activities to be conducted during 2002, 
the broad objectives for 2002 under each of the four primary SRP components are also 
included, shown in italics. 
 
Although it is not possible at this stage to establish what the specific costs of the proposed 
SRP implementation activities will be, activities that are likely to have CCSBT budgetary 
implications have been marked with an *.  The actual budgetary requirements for these items 
will be determined in more detail during the technical workshops, SAG or SC meetings.  In 
particular, financial requirements are likely to increase sharply in 2002, particularly for 
implementation of tagging and observer programs.

shall have equal voting rights.  The provisions of the Convention relating to the Commission 
and the Scientific Committee (Articles 6 to 9, except for 6.9 and 6.10) shall apply mutatis 
mutandis with regard to the Extended Commission and the Extended Scientific Committee.  
Any dispute concerning the interpretation or implementation of this Resolution, including the

The Extended Commission shall report forthwith to the Commission if the latter is in 
session, and in any other case before the latter’s next meeting or session of a meeting, all 
 
 
 
decisions it adopts.  Decisions so reported shall become decisions of the Commission at the 
end of the session of the meeting to which they were reported, unless the Commission decides 
to the contrary.  Any decision of the Commission that affects the operation of the Extended 
Commission or the rights, obligations or status of any individual Member within the Extended

representative of such entity or fishing entity to this effect.  In so doing, the applicant shall give 
the Commission its firm commitment to respect the terms of the Convention and comply with 
such decisions of the Extended Commission as become decisions of the Commission pursuant 
to paragraph 4. 
 
7. 
If the Extended Commission decides to admit the applicant, it shall negotiate with the 
applicant a formula to govern the level of catch of SBT by the applicant pending the next 
decision of the Commission setting a total allowable catch and its allocation among the 
Members.  Upon the successful completion of the negotiations referred to in the previous 
sentence, the Executive Secretary will exchange letters with the applicant as referred to in 
paragraph 6; the applicant shall thereupon assume the status of Member of the Extended 
Commission.  
 
8.

shall be entitled to appoint one representative, to be accompanied by experts and advisers, as 
an Observer to meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies, including the Scientific

the budget of an applicant that is admitted as its Member shall be determined by application 
mutatis mutandis of Article 11 of the Convention.

the operations of the Extended Commission are solely for the purposes of the Convention.

The Executive Secretary shall prepare a report of every annual and special 
meeting of the Commission. The report of an annual meeting shall include a 
summary of Commission activities since the previous annual meeting of the 
Commission. The Executive Secretary shall provide a draft report to the 
Commission for its adoption, subject to amendment prior to the end of the 
annual or special meeting. 
2 
Where an annual or special meeting is adjourned, the Executive Secretary may 
be requested by the Commission to prepare a report of the meeting prior to the 
adjournment. In this case, the Executive Secretary shall provide a draft report to 
the Commission for its adoption, subject to amendment, prior to the 
adjournment of the meeting. Rules applying to an annual or special meeting 
shall also apply to an adjourned meeting.

Every subsidiary or advisory body shall adopt a report prior to the close of its 
meeting and submit its report to the next Commission meeting. 
4 
Subject to this paragraph, the report of a meeting of the Commission shall 
become available for release outside the Commission when that report is 
adopted, unless a Member requests that the report, or a specified part of the 
report, of a meeting of the Commission not be made available for release.  The 
request must be made before adoption of the report.  In that event the 
Commission shall decide whether and to what extent to restrict its release. 
5 
A report to the Commission from a subsidiary or advisory body shall become 
available for release outside the Commission when the report of the meeting of 
the Commission to which the report of that subsidiary or advisory body was 
submitted, is adopted, unless a Member requests that the report, or a specified 
part of the report, of a subsidiary or advisory body not be made available for 
release.  The request must be made before adoption of the report of the meeting 
of the Commission to which the report of the subsidiary or advisory body was 
submitted. 
6 
Subject to paragraphs 8 and 9,  a document submitted to a meeting of the 
Commission shall become available for release outside of the Commission when 
the report of that meeting is adopted, unless either the author of that document, 
or the Member (if the author is a representative of a Member), makes a request 
to restrict its release.  The request must be made before adoption of the report. 
 
 
7 
Subject to paragraphs 8 and 9, a document submitted to a meeting of a 
subsidiary or advisory body of the Commission shall become available for 
release outside the Commission when the report of the meeting of the 
Commission to which the report of that subsidiary or advisory body is 
submitted, is adopted, unless either the author of the document, or the Member 
(if the author is a representative of a Member), makes a request to restrict its 
release.  The request must be made before adoption of the report. 
8 
If a document submitted to the Commission, or a subsidiary or advisory body of 
the Commission contains data from a previous document submitted to the 
Commission or a subsidiary or advisory body of the Commission, the release of 
which has been restricted, the author of the document, or the Member (if the 
author is a representative of a Member) must obtain the permission of the author 
or the Member (if the author is a representative of a Member) that requested the 
restriction of the previous document before granting permission for its release.  
The author or the Member (if the author is a representative of a Member) of the 
previous document may request to restrict the release of the relevant part(s) of 
that document. 
9 
If a document submitted to the Commission, or a subsidiary or advisory body of 
the Commission, contains data or product of data, the release of which has been 
restricted, the author of the document, or the Member (if the author is a

whom the data originated, for its release.  The Member from whom the data 
originated may request to restrict the release of the relevant part(s) of that 
document.

meeting of the Commission, copies of documents or reports of any subsidiary or 
advisory bodies that are to be considered at that meeting to individuals or 
organisations within the Member’s country with whom a Member considers it 
necessary to consult.  The Member shall obtain the necessary undertaking from 
such individuals or organisations to treat the said documents or reports as 
confidential and not to release them to the public or to the media until such time 
as they become public documents.

copies of public documents and reports shall be available to the public at a price 
determined by the Executive Secretary to recover the cost of printing and 
distribution.  Electronic copies of Commission reports shall be made available
