Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
10. The meeting noted the activities of the Secretariat as reported in CCSBT-
EC/1310/04 and agreed to the following recommendations: 
 
• The Terms of Reference (ToR) for the Compliance Committee be amended.  
These amendments allow the CC Chair to be re-appointed twice (for a 
maximum of six years in office) and are provided at Attachment 7; 
• Dr. John Annala be confirmed as Chair of the Scientific Committee (SC) and 
Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) for a further two year period; and 
• Mr. Stan Crothers be confirmed as Chair of the Compliance Committee for a 
further 2 year period. 
11. The Extended Commission also advised that it would be happy for the Executive 
Secretary’s contract to be renewed following the conclusion of his current 
contract on 30 October 2014. 
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
12. The Executive Secretary provided an outline of financial matters that the EC 
would need to consider, including the revised budget for 2013 (CCSBT-
EC/1310/05), and the draft budget for 2014 (CCSBT-EC/1310/06).   
13. The forecast expenditure for 2013 reported in CCSBT-EC/1310/05 provided an 
11% savings on the approved 2013 budget.  Approximately half of these savings 
were attributed to the relocation of the Compliance Committee Working Group 
(CCWG2) from Tokyo to Canberra, and to the exclusion of on-site assessments 
from the Trial Quality Assurance Reviews (QARs).  
14. The Executive Secretary noted that two versions of the 2014 draft budget had 
been prepared.  One version included an allowance for a $100,000 contribution to 
the scientific aerial survey, while the alternative budget included a $750,000 
contribution to the aerial survey as requested by Australia.  
15. Detailed consideration of the two budget papers was referred to the Finance and 
Administration Committee (FAC). 
16. The FAC was convened to consider: 
• The revised budget for 2013; 
• The budget for 2014; and 
• Related matters, including financial implications of meetings and workplans 
proposed by the Compliance Committee (CC) and the Extended Scientific 
Committee (ESC). 
17. Dr Kevin Sullivan (New Zealand) was nominated as Chair of the FAC. 
 
3.1. Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
18. The Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC) presented the 
report of the FAC, which is provided at Attachment 8. It includes a revised 
budget for 2013 and a recommended budget for 2014. 
2013 
19. The Executive Secretary identified further savings for the revised 2013 budget at 
the FAC meeting and the final revised 2013 budget provided savings of 
approximately 12% against the approved expenditure for 2013. 
 
20. The meeting adopted the revised 2013 budget which is provided at Annex A of 
the FAC’s report. 
2014 
21. The FAC recommended the following main budget items for 2014: 
• Funding of two scientific research projects: Continued collection of close-kin 
samples ($30,000) and a design study for future close-kin studies ($75,000); 
• A Quality Assurance Review budget of $100,000 including the proviso that 
the Executive Secretary may spend up to an additional 30% of this amount if 
required; 
• $75,000 for the CCSBT performance review; 
• A funding contribution of $100,000 to the scientific Aerial Survey; and 
• Meetings of the Compliance Committee Working Group (CCWG3) in Busan 
during April 2014 (approximately $89,000), a 4-day scientific technical 
meeting in Seattle ($68,000), and the annual SC/ESC, Compliance Committee 
and Commission/EC meetings as proposed in paper CCSBT-EC/1310/06. 
22. It was noted that the proposed budget for 2014 results in an overall cost increase 
of 5.3% in Members’ contributions for 2014. 
23. The meeting adopted the 2014 budget which is provided at Annex B of the report.  
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries and ERS Interactions 
24. The Chair noted the deliberations of the Compliance Committee and invited 
Members to ask any additional questions regarding Members’ and CNMs’ 
National Reports to those already raised at CC8.  No additional questions were 
raised.  
 
4.1. Reports on Members’ projects 
25. The Chair opened the floor for any special reports from Members. 
 
4.1.1. Market Monitoring 
26. Japan noted it had not submitted a paper on the monitoring of its markets to this 
meeting, but it had continued its monitoring and that no major issues had been 
identified in Japan’s market monitoring this year. 
 
4.1.2. Australian SBT farming operations, including implementation of 
stereo video monitoring 
27. The Chair requested that Australia update the meeting on its progress with 
respect to stereo video monitoring.  Australia explained that the newly elected 
Australian Government was concerned that unautomated stereo video monitoring 
would impose an excessive regulatory and financial burden on industry. The 
Government had therefore decided to postpone the implementation of stereo 
video monitoring until an automated solution could be developed although 
 
Australia still remains committed to the implementation of stereo video.  In the 
interim, Australia noted that it would be increasing its efforts to find an 
automated solution as well as continuing with its 100 fish sampling regime.  
28. Japan and other Members noted the extra uncertainty of unaccounted mortality 
created by the delay in the implementation of the stereo video system.  
 
4.1.3. Other 
29. There were no other special projects that Members wished to report on.  
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
30. The Chair of the Compliance Committee presented the report of the Eighth 
Meeting of the Compliance Committee (CC8), including the extensive workplan, 
and thanked participants for a productive and constructive meeting.  
31. The CC Chair noted that there were two outstanding items that had not been 
resolved during the CC meeting, and that these would both be discussed further 
under agenda item 9 of the EC: 
• Australia’s delay in implementation of stereo video; and 
• The review of Japan’s compliance.  
32. The Chair of the CC drew attention to CC8’s recommendations to the Extended 
Commission.  
33. There was further discussion on Attachment 6 of the report (the CCSBT IUU 
Resolution).  This was subsequently adopted with two small amendments: 
• Deletion of the phrase “agreed updated current” from paragraph 2; and 
• The removal of Annex III, item v. 
34. The meeting then adopted the CC8 report and its recommendations with the 
exception of the following two recommendations which would be discussed and 
refined during the current meeting: 
• The QARs proposed for 2014; and  
• The future work plan.  
35. The report of CC8 is provided at Attachment 9. 
36. The Terms of Reference for the QARs to be conducted during 2014 were agreed 
by the EC and are provided at Attachment 10. 
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
37. The Chair of the Ecologically Related Species Working Group (ERSWG) 
presented CCSBT-EC/1310/19, the report of the Tenth meeting of the ERSWG 
(Attachment 11), including a review of the ERSWG’s 2014 workplan, which is 
summarised in paper CCSBT-EC/1310/09. 
38. The EC adopted the Report of the ERSWG 10 meeting. 
 
39. It was agreed that the ERSWG would not be reconvened until March 2015. 
However, New Zealand expressed concern regarding the extended timeframe 
before the next ERSWG meeting.  
40. Japan noted that a small technical working group (the Effectiveness of Seabird 
Mitigation Measures technical Group) had been formed that would progress work 
on technical matters related to monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of 
bycatch mitigation measures,  up until the next ERSWG meeting.  A Terms of 
Reference (ToR) for this small technical Working Group is provided at 
Attachment C of paper CCSBT-EC/1310/09.   
41. New Zealand proposed a revision to the ToR to reflect the need to avoid delays in 
the absence of an ERSWG meeting in 2014. 
42. Following further discussions, a revision of the “Effectiveness of Seabird 
Mitigation Measures Technical Group Terms of Reference” was agreed and is 
attached at Attachment 12.  
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Modification of CCSBT’s ERS Recommendation 
43. Australia drew attention to papers CCSBT-EC/1310/22 and CCSBT-EC/1310/23 
which propose two new draft Resolutions with respect to Ecologically Related 
Species (ERS). It was noted that no intersessional comments had been received 
on these two draft resolutions. 
44. Some Members indicated their support for the introduction of binding mitigation 
measures, while other Members indicated their flexibility in terms of being able 
to consider binding measures. Japan showed its concern for introducing binding 
ERS measures by CCSBT from both legal and operational aspect. 
45. Paper CCSBT-EC/1310/10 was also discussed.  This paper contains a draft 
Resolution considered at CCSBT 19 that converts CCSBT’s agreed ERS 
Recommendation into a binding measure. 
46. Australia noted its preference to adopt the more specific and recently proposed 
binding resolutions proposed in papers 22 and 23, rather than the earlier proposal 
detailed in paper 10 but was willing to use paper 10 as a starting point if other 
members so chose. 
47. No agreement was reached regarding the “Draft Resolution to Mitigate the 
Impact on Ecologically Related Species of Fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna”, 
put forward by Australia. 
48. Australia and Japan will continue to work intersessionally. 
49. New Zealand requested that intersessional discussions include consideration of 
adding the IATTC area into the draft resolution text. 
50. Members provided a commitment to adhere to the ERS rules in the RFMO 
Convention Areas in which their vessels fish for SBT. 
 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
51. The Chair of the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) presented the report of 
the ESC meeting which is summarised in papers CCSBT-EC/1310/11 and 
CCSBT-EC/1310/20.   
52. The Extended Commission adopted the ESC report and its recommendations 
with the exception of the following three recommendations which would be 
discussed and possibly refined later during the current meeting: 
• The Management Procedure (MP) recommendations for the Total Allowable 
Catch (TAC); 
• The recommended allocation of 10 t per year to cover mortality associated 
with approved research projects; and 
• Priorities for the Scientific Research Plan for 2014 to 2018. 
53. The report of the ESC is at Attachment 13.  
54. The meeting agreed to discuss the TAC and research mortality allowance further 
under agenda item 9, and to refer the proposed research plan to the FAC for its 
consideration. Members provided additional information on the close-kin and 
gene tagging research proposals in order to assist the FAC with its prioritisation 
process. 
55. Members asked the ESC Chair a number of questions on recruitment indicators, 
2014 work plan priorities, and details of the Management Procedure.  In response 
to questions, the ESC Chair confirmed that: 
• the MP assumed all catch was included within the global TAC and took no 
account of additional SBT mortalities (noting that robustness testing for 
historical overcatch had been undertaken but not for overcatch going forward); 
and 
• the differing indices of recruitment (aerial, troll and commercial SAPUE) 
measured the relative abundance of different age classes of SBT. 
56. It was noted that the full stock assessment being planned by the ESC for 2014 
would be conducting sensitivity runs to examine the impact of unaccounted catch 
mortality, such as: catches by non-members, releases/discarded fish, recreational 
catch estimates and mortality from other unreported sources. 
57. The meeting acknowledged the recent increased participation of Indonesia, Korea 
and Taiwan in SBT research and encouraged these Members to participate in 
future research projects in order to build scientific research capacity across all 
CCSBT Members.  
58. Following report back from the FAC, the meeting adopted the ESC Workplan  
noting that expenditure has been approved for two of the three proposed items 
listed in the Scientific Research Program: 
• Continued collection of close-kin samples; and 
• Design study for close-kin studies. 
 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
59. Indonesia presented its proposal that the EC consider a re-assessment of its 
annual catch quota, in particular that an additional and separate allocation of 
approximately 300t be allocated to its artisanal fleet (≤30GT, registered by 
provincial and districts).  
60. Indonesia explained the difficulties of managing an artisanal fishery where SBT 
was caught as an unexpected bycatch, and requested Members’ understanding, 
support and approval of its proposal.  Members acknowledged that Indonesia 
faced compliance challenges. 
61. The CC Chair explained that Indonesia had agreed to participate in phase 1 and 2 
QARs during 2014 in order to identify areas where the Commission might 
provide assistance to Indonesia to strengthen its compliance systems and 
processes including to address Indonesia’s request for consideration of its 
allocation.  Japan noted that capacity building to assist Indonesia to obtain 
accurate catch amount should be addressed prior to any consideration of 
allocation changes.  
62.  Japan gave a presentation on its compliance systems to assist with its compliance 
review of as outlined in the Resolution on the Allocation of the Global Total 
Allowable Catch.   
63. Japan clarified that genetic testing was conducted only on imported tuna not 
Japanese fleet landings. The Chair asked about the level of non-compliance 
detected and Japan reported that under the current system there had been no 
violations detected. 
64. Members asked Japan about its at-sea and in-port transhipping processes, as well 
as its in-port inspection processes for both imported and domestically caught tuna.   
 
9.1 TAC Determination 
65. The EC agreed to continue a precautionary approach during the early stages of 
the spawning stock rebuilding by: 
• Commencing the process to account for all mortalities in the SBT fishery; and 
• Increasing the transparency of SBT fisheries. 
66. Recognising uncertainties around all sources of unaccounted catch mortality, the 
EC agreed to develop a common definition of the “Attributable SBT Catch” for 
all Members and CNMs that would include all sources of mortality.  As a first 
step the EC asked the CC to develop by 2014 a common definition of the 
“Attributable SBT Catch” taking into account the importance of including all 
sources of mortality and for Members to consider and commit to a timetable for 
its implementation commencing in 2015 with annual reporting to the EC1. 
67. In addition, the EC requested the ESC to conduct sensitivity analysis around all 
sources of unaccounted catch mortality as part of the ESC’s planned 2014 stock 
assessment and to incorporate this information in its advice on the existence of 
                                                 
 
1 The annual reporting template to be modified accordingly. 
 
exceptional circumstances and approach to follow as defined in the Management 
Procedure in accordance with the metarule process.  The EC also asked the ESC 
to provide preliminary advice to CCSBT 21 on the impact of any unaccounted 
catch mortalities on the stock assessment projections and the possible 
Management Procedure recommendation beyond the 2015-17 quota block.  
68. The sources of mortality should include: 
• Unreported or uncertainty in retained catch by Members, for example: 
o surface fisheries, 
o artisanal catch, 
o non-compliance with existing measures (e.g. catch over-run);  
• Mortality from releases and/or discards; 
• Recreational fisheries; 
• Catches by non-Members;  
• Research Mortality Allowance; and 
• Any other sources of mortality that the ESC is able to provide advice on 
(including depredation). 
69. The EC agreed to the following measures to increase transparency of SBT 
fisheries management: 
• Quality Assurance Reviews (QARs): 
o Indonesia  - Phase 1&2 in 2014, 
o Australia - Phase 2 in 2014, 
o Taiwan – Phase 1 in 2014, 
o Japan - Phase 2 in 2015. 
• QARs once the above reviews have been completed, commencing with New 
Zealand and Korea; 
• Australia has invited Members to observe the 100 fish sampling method and 
transfers to grow-out pontoons;  
• Japan will conduct genetic testing of its domestic tuna landings from 2014 and 
report results in its annual reports to the EC1, commencing in 2014; and 
• Enhanced provision of data. 
70. Recognising the uncertainty in relation to unaccounted catch mortality and the 
EC’s request to the ESC for advice and noting the EC’s procedures for handling 
uncertainty and its exceptional circumstances and metarule processes, the EC 
agreed to confirm the TAC for 2014 at 12,449 tonnes and agreed to set the TAC 
for 2015-2017 at 14,647 tonnes per year.  The EC will confirm the 2016-2017 
TAC at CCSBT 21 following consideration of the advice from the ESC and other 
information identified above. 
71. The EC further reiterated its commitment to full implementation of its Corrective 
Actions Policy. 
 
 
9.2 Research Mortality Allowance 
72. The EC approved the requests of Australia and Japan for Research Mortality 
Allowances (RMA) totalling 5.95 t and 1.0 t respectively in 2014.   
73. As part of the process to account for all mortalities in the SBT fishery, the EC 
agreed that from 2015, an allocation of 10 t would be made for Research 
Mortality Allowance within the TAC recommended by the MP. 
 
9.3 Allocation of the TAC 
74. The meeting confirmed that South Africa’s Nominal Catch will be 150 tonnes 
once it accedes to the Convention.  South Africa’s allocation for the year it 
accedes will be 150 t if it accedes by 31 May of that year, otherwise South 
Africa’s allocation will remain on 40 t for that year. 
75. The EC confirmed that allocations of the TAC to Members and Cooperating 
Non-Members would continue to be conducted in accordance with the CCSBT’s 
Resolution on the Allocation of the Global Total Allowable Catch.   
76. The agreed allocations of the TAC for 2014 are shown in Table 1.  
 
Table 1: Current allocations for 2014 
 
(A)

77. Table 2 provides the agreed annual allocations for 2015-2017 based on the 
assumptions that the TAC for 2016-2017 is confirmed as being 14,647 t, noting 
that 10 t of this amount has been allocated to RMA, and that no other decisions 
are taken by the EC to change the nominal catches for any Member. 
 
                                                 
 
2 These figures apportion the additional 110 t (from South Africa) to Members according to their nominal catch 
percentage levels in accordance with the Resolution on Allocation of the Global Total Allowable Catch.

78. The Chair noted that QARs are an important element of this agenda item. 
79. TRAFFIC stated that it was important to have in place adequate penalties for any 
SBT over-fishing that is identified by the Commission.  This view was noted by 
the Chair. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Implementation of the CCSBT Strategic Plan 
80. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/1310/13 on the 
implementation of the CCSBT Strategic Plan.  The paper presented action items 
from the Strategic Plan for 2013 and 2014 that have not already been considered 
at CCSBT meetings. 
 
10.1.  Action scheduled for 2013 
10.1.1. Performance Review of the CCSBT (high priority) 
81. The meeting agreed to the Draft Terms of Reference for the Second Performance 
Review of the CCSBT, as well as to the Draft Qualification Criteria and 
Selection Process for the Independent Review Panel provided in attachments A 
and B respectively of paper CCSBT-EC/1310/13.  
82. The Executive Secretary confirmed that the current budget covers the selection of 
three review panel members and advised that four nominations have been 
received for the review panel.    
83. It was agreed that the Chair of the Commission and the Executive Secretary will 
progress selection of performance review panel members intersessionally. 
 
                                                 
 
3 These figures apportion the additional 110 t (from South Africa) to Japan because all other Members have 
reached their nominal allocation. 
4 Indonesia’s allocation will be re-assessed by the Extended Commission, once the QAR report is available. 
 
10.1.2. Develop mechanisms for extending CCSBT Membership to REIOs 
(medium priority)  
84. CCSBT 19 considered mechanisms for extending CCSBT membership to 
Regional Economic Integration Organisations (REIOs) such as the EU.  The 
Executive Secretary noted the most prudent mechanism to pursue at the present 
time would be to modify the text of the existing, “Resolution to Establish an 
Extended Commission and an Extended Scientific Committee (Extended 
Commission Resolution)”, rather than amending the Convention text.  Modifying 
the Convention is probably the most appropriate option in the long term and any 
such modification should include consideration of Taiwan. 
85. The EU assured the EC that it still has a strong interest in becoming a Member of 
the CCSBT, and confirmed its support for the proposed method of joining. The 
EU also reiterated that it would fully comply with all CCSBT measures.   
86. Taiwan noted that any amendment to the Extended Commission Resolution 
should not in any way change its status as a Member of the Extended 
Commission or require it to reapply for Membership status.   
87. The meeting recommended the proposed amendments to the draft Extended 
Commission Resolution.  The draft Resolution is provided for consideration by 
the Commission and is at Attachment 14. 
 
10.1.3. Flag State/Fishing Entity self assessment of capacity (low priority) 
88. The Chair noted that each Member and CNM had been requested to conduct a 
self-assessment of its SBT fishing capacity, and that New Zealand was the only 
Member that had provided its self-assessment to CCSBT 20.  
89. Members commended New Zealand for providing its self-assessment.  Korea 
advised that its QAR included questioning of its fishing capacity and that Korea 
commented that it considers its capacity to be at an appropriate level in relation 
to its available fishing opportunities.  Japan, Korea and Taiwan undertook to 
provide self-assessments to CCSBT 21, and Australia noted that it would aim to 
provide its self-assessment immediately following CCSBT20. 
90. The Chair recommended that this agenda item be carried forward to CCSBT 21.    
 
10.2.  Action scheduled for 2014 
91. The Chair noted the three low priority items from the Strategic Plan that had not 
yet been considered by the EC: 
• Analysis of Maximum Economic Yield (MEY); 
• Evaluation of alternative harvest strategies to optimise returns from the 
SBT stock including the adoption of MEY as the rebuilding reference 
point; and 
• Developing and implementing a framework for quota trading between 
Members and CNMs.  
92. Members agreed that these three items should remain in the Strategic Plan as 
lower priority items to be considered in the long term.  
 
 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Cooperating Non-Members 
93. The Chair presented paper CCSBT-EC/1310/14 and noted the absence of South 
Africa from the meeting. The Chair noted that South Africa had written to the 
Commission requesting that its CNM status be continued and advising that its 
accession process was nearing finalisation.  
94. The meeting expressed its serious concerns about South Africa’s continued 
overcatches and affirmed the Compliance Committee’s request that South Africa 
implement a plan to remedy its overcatch and to report all required information in 
its Annual Report.  In particular, instead of reporting operations by the charter or 
domestic fleets, South Africa is requested to further break this down by the type 
of target fishery. 
95. The meeting confirmed the continuing CNM status of all three existing CNMs: 
the EU, the Philippines, and South Africa for 2014. 
96. Japan noted that in July 2013, Croatia had joined the European Union as its 28th 
Member. Japan asked whether any SBT caught by Croatian-flagged vessels 
would now be included as EU catch within the EU’s current allocation.  The EU 
confirmed that this was the case.  
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
97. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/1310/15 on CCSBT’s 
relationship with Non-members. 
98. The Executive Secretary confirmed that, as requested by CCSBT19, letters had 
been sent to China, Hong Kong, Singapore and the USA inviting them to attend 
CC8 as observers.  Singapore had accepted the invitation and attended CC8.  The 
USA had also accepted the invitation, but were unable to attend due to the 
shutdown of the USA Government.  Hong Kong advised that it would not attend 
CC8, but wished to assure the CCSBT that it recognised the importance of the 
conservation of marine resources, and noted that it will continue to strengthen its 
efforts in promoting the conservation and sustainable use of the marine 
environment.  No response was received from China. 
99. New Zealand sought clarification as to whether the USA collects copies of any 
CCSBT CDS forms received.  The Executive Secretary confirmed that this is the 
case, but that these copies are not yet provided to the Secretariat.  The Secretariat 
is uncertain as to the level of checking conducted by the USA with respect to the 
CDS forms it receives. 
100. The meeting agreed that it was extremely important to continue its efforts to 
engage with China.  It was reiterated that a delegation of CCSBT Members will 
seek to meet with China in the margins of next WCPFC meeting to be held in 
Cairns during December 2013, and that Japan has agreed to take the lead in terms 
of coordinating this CCSBT delegation.  
101. It was also agreed that in order to further encourage China’s engagement with the 
CCSBT: 
• Members will individually consider contacting to China via their diplomatic 
channels; and  
• The Chair of the Commission will write to China on behalf of all Members. 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Evaluation of Kobe Process  Recommendations 
102. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/1310/16 on the Kobe 
process.  It was noted that, with the exception of two low priority items, CCSBT 
has made progress on all of the Kobe III recommendations.  
103. At New Zealand’s request, the Chair of ERSWG provided additional background 
information on the Joint Technical Bycatch Working Group (JTBWG).  
104. It was agreed that the ERSWG Chair should write to the JTBWG Chair, and that 
the Chair of the Commission should write to the Steering Committee to try to re-
invigorate the JTBWG’s activities, and to ensure that the JTBWG is inclusive of 
all RFMOs in order to promote harmonisation.  
105. Korea asked why there had been no progress noted on Kobe III recommendation 
11 under item III - Compliance and Enforcement.  This recommendation states 
that: “Kobe III participants recommended that the tRFMOs establish a common 
format for assessing compliance with data reporting requirements. Furthermore, 
to facilitate compliance, participants recommended that all tRFMOs streamline 
and harmonize their reporting formats, procedures, and timing.”  The Executive 
Secretary explained that this item had initially been identified as being low to 
medium priority.   
106. The meeting agreed that the Secretariat would liaise with the other tuna RFMOs 
in relation to the formats they used for assessing compliance with data reporting 
requirements and give consideration to a harmonised format. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
107. The Chair introduced this item which is summarised in the Secretariat’s paper 
CCSBT-EC/1310/17 on activities with other organisations. 
108. CCSBT Members act as observers at other RFMO meetings of interest and 
provide report backs to CCSBT on matters of relevance in order to improve 
coordination with other RFMOs. 
109. The following reports were delivered by Members as part of their Observer 
duties for the CCSBT, and are provided at Attachment 15. 
• Korea’s report on the on 9th Annual Meeting of WCPFC in Manila, the 
Philippines between 2 - 6 Dec 2012; 
 
• Australia’s report on the 31st Annual Meeting of the Commission for the 
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in Hobart, 
Australia between 23 Oct – 1 Nov 2012. It was noted that the proposed 
cooperative arrangement with CCSBT had been endorsed by CCAMLR, and 
that CCAMLR had also indicated its willingness to share its knowledge on 
reducing incidental seabird mortalities with CCSBT; 
• Indonesia’s report on the 17th Session of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission 
(IOTC) in Mauritius between 6 – 10 April 2013;  
• Taiwan’s report on the 85th Annual Meeting of the Inter-American Tropical 
Tuna Commission (IATTC) held in Veracruz, Mexico between 10 -14 June 
2013; and 
• Japan’s report on the 18th Special Meeting of the International Commission for 
the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in Morocco between 12 -19 
November 2012. 
110. It was confirmed that there was no discussion about matters related to CCSBT at 
any of the observed meetings except for the CCAMLR meeting. 
111. It was agreed that the following Members would act as Observers to other 
RFMOs on behalf of CCSBT during 2013/14: 
• Korea to continue as an Observer to WCPFC; 
• Australia to continue as an Observer to CCAMLR; 
• Indonesia to continue as an Observer to IOTC;  
• Japan to continue as an Observer to ICCAT; and 
• Taiwan to continue as an Observer to IATTC.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Good morning everybody, and welcome to Adelaide. 
I trust that everyone who participated in the tour of the Adelaide hills and the various 
stops along the way had a pleasurable experience and a memory of Adelaide in which 
they will remember for a long time.  
Australia appreciates the thanks expressed by Members for hosting the 20th annual 
meeting of the CCSBT and wishes to extend our thanks to the preparation work of the 
Secretariat in their organisation of the meeting and all the documents we will consider 
over the next four days, which are of the usual high standard.   
In Australia’s view, success this week will be a consensus decision to adopt a global 
total allowable catch level in accordance with our management procedure that 
addresses the depleted state of the southern bluefin tuna spawning stock and continues 
to secures its rebuilding. Although there are some positive signs for rebuilding 
projections, they remain only that – projections.  
This week’s meeting also requires the Extended Commission to focus on the wider 
management of the SBT fisheries. In Australia’s view, success this week will see 
stronger management measures in place, continued co-operation by all Members 
(similar to that experienced last year), particularly in relation to ecologically related 
species.  
At last week’s Compliance Committee meeting there was general consensus among 
Members and Co-operating Non-Members that there is a need to strengthen 
compliance by adopting binding measures. The success of four Members undergoing 
the trial quality assurance review was evidence of this, and was further supported by 
the constructive discussions towards an ongoing implementation of the quality 
assurance review mechanism. 
Australia recognises the importance of this week in agreeing the national allocation of 
each Member and Co-operating non-Member within the global total allowable catch.  
For Australia, as a significant coastal range State for southern bluefin tuna with an 
important locally-based industry, this is a crucial issue. Despite the best efforts of this 
organisation, and the tens of millions of dollars that Australia alone has spent on 
scientific research, the southern bluefin stock remains in a significantly depleted state.  
This organisation has at times struggled to move past the annual focus on setting the 
total allowable catch and national allocations. It is Australia’s expectation that, if we 
can achieve our main task this week of setting the total allowable catch for the next 
three years and establishing national allocations, this will then allow the Extended 
Commission to turn its focus to other priorities. For Australia, paramount among these 
is to first, address the impacts of fishing for southern bluefin tuna on ecologically-
related species, such as seabirds, sharks and sea turtles. This work has been identified 
by our working groups in the intersessional period as a priority for consideration at 
this meeting, which is highlighted by the observer reporting requirements we will 
discuss during this week. 
In closing, let me again welcome you all to Australia, and assure you all that Australia 
will continue to work constructively and cooperatively with all Members to ensure the 
Extended Commission achieves its objectives this week. 
Thankyou.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen, Good 
morning. 
 
On behalf of the Taiwanese delegation, I would like to extend our appreciation to our 
host, the Australian Government for the very warm welcome to the beautiful city, 
Adelaide and arrangements for the wonderful excursion yesterday. We all enjoyed the 
trip and the excellent morning tea, lunch, and wine testing. My thanks also go to Mr. 
Kennedy and the staffs of the Secretariat for preparing such completed meeting 
documents and making meeting arrangements. I would also like to welcome the 
representatives of the Philippines, and European Union as Cooperating Non-Member 
and observers from the Human Society International, Fisheries Development Council 
International (FDCI), U.S.-Japan Research Institute, and TRAFFIC. 
 
In 2011, we made a very important decision that a Management Procedure (MP) 
would be used to guide the setting of the SBT global total allowable catch (TAC) to 
ensure that the SBT spawning stock biomass achieves the interim rebuilding target of 
20% of the original spawning stock biomass.  
 
After last several years reducing TAC by members, we are pleased to have the 
recommendation from the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) held in Canberra this 
September that there is no need to revise the TAC (12,449 t) for 2014 made by the 
Extended Commission in 2011. Besides, the recommended annual TAC for the years 
2015- 2017 (14,647.4 t) based on MP can be increased about 18% from the TAC in 
2014.  
 
For reaching the above interim rebuilding target of the stock, we believe that 
controlling and monitoring national allocation or catch limit of all members and 
cooperating non-members is the most important task of monitoring, control, and 
surveillance (MCS) measures. At the same time, the Catch documentation scheme 
(CDS) adopted by the CCSBT is the most useful tool of the current MCS measures. 
We should ensure its effective implementation. Besides, how to assist developing 
country to build its capability for data collection and MCS measures is still a vital 
issue. Another critical issue we are concerned is that all sources of SBT mortality 
have to be collected, monitored, and reported to the Extended Commission to ensure 
the accuracy of data used by the stock assessment. 
 
In closing, I look forward to working with all members and co-operating 
non-members in the following days to achieve positive outcomes for the SBT fishery. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Mr. Chair, distinguish delegates, ladies and gentlemen. 
Good morning everybody and  
Thank you vey much for this floor.  
Firstly, On behalf of Indonesia delegation, I wish to extend my thanks to Austarlia 
Government for hosting this Extended Commission Meeting and organizing  a free 
memorable tour yesterday. We really enjoy the tour and a beauty of this city.  
At the same time, I also would like to thanks to CCSBT Secretariate who has made a 
good effort in the convening of the 20th CCSBT Extended Commission Meeting.  
I understand that this Extended Commission Meeting will discuss and decide some 
important issues related to the SBT conservation and management measures.  As a 
member, I need to reiterate our commitment to comply with the measures, eventhough 
there are some issues, in fact,  could not be avoid. For that reason, I do hope that in 
the decision making process, we need to take into account the circumtances or 
difficulties being faced by the member,  in relation to effective implementation of the 
adopted conservation and management measures.  
Mr. Chair, distinguish delegates, ladies and gentlemen. 
At this important occasion, let me  share our experience in implementing annual catch 
quota allocation. As we have mentioned before that we do committed to support this 
management measures, which we believe,  it is intended to ensure the sustainability 
use of SBT resource.  
But after implementing the quota approach within 5 (five) years, we have had some 
difficulties controlling the annual catch limit based on the current reserved quota,  due 
to the existency of artisanal tuna longliner or small scale fisheries, that are mainly 
fishing within Indonesia fisheries management zone.  We could not prevent them 
from catching SBT,  since SBT is caught as un-expected bycatch.  We also could not 
blame them or fine them from catching SBT, since they are not intending to catch 
the fish, but other tunas as their main livelihood. Morever, they have  been involving 
in this artisanal tuna longline fisheries for some decades.  
Mr. Chair, distinguish delegates, ladies and gentlemen 
For the interest of the artisanal fishermen livelihood, we have submitted a proposal to 
re-visit Indonesia annual catch quota, as the current reserved quota is considered too 
small. We have addressed this issue during the Compliance Committee Meeting and  
we would like to present the proposal to the 20th CCSBT Extended Commission 
Meeting for consideration, support and approval.  
Finally, under the spirit of cooperation among members, once again, I thank you very 
much for members’ understanding in this concern.  
 
Thank you very much

Head of Indonesia Delegation

Opening Statement by Japan 
 
Good morning. I would like to say a few words on behalf of the Japanese delegation.  
First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to Australia for hosting 
the 20th Annual Commission Meeting in this beautiful city of Adelaide. Blessed with 
very pleasant weather, I have been enjoying my stay here. Yesterday, I also had the 
opportunity to enjoy beautiful scenery, famous Australia wines and an enjoyable lunch, 
thanks to the kind invitation of Australia. For the first time in my life, I tried 
Kangaroo meat. I would like to also thank Mr. Kennedy and the Secretariat staff for 
their work in organizing this meeting, as well as the interpreters who do a wonderful 
job every time. 
 
This year is a significant year as we are having our 20th Commission Meeting. It is 
also an important year, as we have in front of us the 2nd round of TAC calculated by 
the Management Procedure agreed in 2011, and to make our decision on quota based 
on this. We are on track to recover the stock based on this Management Procedure. 
Fortunately, SBT stock is showing signs of recovery thanks to the past effort put in by 
those involved. We must work to develop our fishery while we also take care of 
ecologically related species. 
 
In Japan, we have been for the last few years working to enhance our domestic system 
to strengthen compliance. This was a difficult and painful process both for the 
Japanese SBT industry and for the administrators, but we have accomplished our task. 
Through full implementation of detailed daily reporting and landing inspections on all 
SBT landing, we have ensured compliance of conservation and management measures 
that CCSBT has adopted, and we are proud of that. But we will not be satisfied with 
this; we will continue to work hard to make further improvements. I hope that we will 
gain your understanding on this matter. 
 
Next, in order to have a constructive discussion, I have to say things that are hard to 
say. On this occasion we came here with high hopes, expecting that progress will be 
made on the long standing concern of CCSBT. That is, in relation to the Australia 
SBT farming sector, we expected that stereo video cameras would be introduced, as 
Australia had promised last year. To our great disappointment, our expectations were 
crushed at last week’s Compliance Committee Meeting. But we have not given up 
hope. I strongly hope that we are able to remove this concern as soon as possible by 
tackling the problem head on, and hope that we see some progress made on this issue 
at the Extended Commission Meeting. 
Attachment 4-4 
 
We have a full agenda again at this meeting. There may be plenty of difficult items but 
I hope we have a constructive discussion based on friendship and can make this a 
fruitful meeting. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Tena koutou, tënä koutou, tënä koutou katoa. Nga mihi nui ki a koutou 
 
On behalf of the New Zealand delegation I would like to extend our greetings to the 
Chair, distinguished visitors, our colleagues from other delegations and to observers at 
this meeting.  
  
Firstly thank you for today’s welcome and our thanks also to our hosts the Australian 
Government for the selection of Adelaide and its fine convention centre as the venue 
for this meeting.  
  
I would also like to thank the Australian delegation for the excursion yesterday. It 
provided a welcome break after the rigours of a three day meeting of the Compliance 
Committee. 
 
Turning to the meeting before us, as always, New Zealand looks forward to further 
constructive dialogue on the important business of this Commission. The adoption of 
a management procedure was a major milestone for us all and it is encouraging to see 
that according to that procedure we can already realize the benefits from the 
conservation initiatives taken by this Commission. 
 
Given the optimism with which we approached this meeting we were dismayed to 
receive advice in the Compliance Committee of a further delay in the implementation 
of the stereo video technology in the Australian fishery, a commitment originally 
made to this Commission 2006. This delay will have a significant impact on the 
interests of other Commission members and New Zealand will need to reflect upon 
these impacts as we move through the agenda of this meeting. This is disappointing to 
say the least. 
 
On a more positive note, it is pleasing to see that the Scientific Committee has at last 
initiated a process to incorporate all sources of fishing related mortality in its 
assessment of the southern bluefin tuna stock. This is a significant step forward and 
long overdue. It is now time for the Commission to take a similar step forward and 
account for all those mortalities in its management arrangement. 
 
It will come as no surprise to other members that New Zealand continues to advocate 
that as a matter of principal, all southern bluefin tuna mortalities including 
recreational catches and discards should be attributed to the national allocations to 
which they relate. 
 
We clearly have the opportunity to do this as and when the global TAC and national 
allocations increase and New Zealand considers that a common definition of 
attributable catch to include all such mortalities should be developed and applied as a 
matter or urgently. Only once we achieve this can we confidently claim that we have 
both a principled and a sound fisheries management regime in place for southern 
bluefin tuna. This action would also provide greater strength to our argument that all 
countries with vessels that catch southern bluefin tuna should cooperate with this 
Commission. 
 
New Zealand is also conscious that, as and when catches increase, we must take 
particular account of the potential impact of increasing fishing effort on ecologically 
related species. Managing and mitigating any adverse effects of fishing on incidental 
bycatch species is also a matter of good practice and sound fisheries management.  
We should be prepared to adopt further mitigation actions to address key areas of risk 
and species at risk. 
 
Chair, in closing New Zealand has been encouraged by the progress achieved by the 
Commission in recent years and we believe that it is essential that we maintain that 
momentum at this and future meetings.  
  
Thank you  
 
Attachment 4-6 
Opening Statement by Republic of Korea 
 
Mr. Chair,  
the Executive Secretary and his team,  
Distinguished delegates from Members, Cooperating Non-members and Observers,  
 
First and foremost, on behalf of the Korean delegation, I would like to extend my 
gratitude to the Australian government for hosting the 20th meeting of the CCSBT 
here in this beautiful city of Adelaide. I also thank Mr. Kennedy and his team for 
facilitating the meeting so efficiently.  
 
As we are aware, this is the Extended Commission’s second time to decide three-year 
TAC since the adoption of the MP two years ago. During the short period of two years, 
the Commission has made significant achievements. For example, we introduced and 
implemented an external compliance verification system called the Quality Assurance 
Review and developed the Minimum Performance Requirements for major 
management tools such as CDS. Although there is still a lot of room for improvement, 
all these progresses we have been making so far will serve as a good example to other 
RFMOs and we deserve to be proud of ourselves.  
 
The Scientific Committee this year concluded that there had not been any abnormal 
situation happened in SBT resources and the Commission could afford a slight 
increase in its TAC. This is definitely good news because it means that the 
Commission is smoothly moving towards its goal of recovering the resources. 
However, it doesn’t necessarily mean that we can let our guards down, sit back and 
relax. Rather, it means we should keep strengthening our compliance with CCSBT 
measures and closely monitor the changes in the resources. This way, we will be able 
to keep walking down the road that will lead us to achieving the goal we set in 2011. 
To this end, important, but pending issues such as Port State Measures Resolution, 
revision of Transshipment Resolution and strengthening scientific observer standards 
will need to be duly addressed sooner rather than later. 
 
CCSBT 20 has a lot on a plate this year as well. I hope all Members and Cooperating 
Non-members should pool our strengths and wisdom together to draw fruitful results 
at this meeting.  
 
Again, I would like to thank all of you who are involved in the work of this great 
organization.

Opening Statement by the Philippines  
 
 
 
On behalf of the Philippine delegation, I would like to express our gratitude to 
the Government of Australia for the gracious hospitality extended to us and for 
hosting the 20th  Annual Meeting of the Commission on the Conservation of Southern 
Blue Fin Tuna (CCSBT). 
  
 
The Philippines, as a cooperating non-member in the Commission for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), is committed to comply with the 
requirements and management measures established by the Commission in 
accordance with  Article 3 of the Convention which is to ensure, through appropriate 
management, the conservation and optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna. The 
Philippines considers this as compliance to its duty to cooperate in accordance with its 
obligations under Article 64 [Highly migratory species] of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea. 
 
 
In this regard, and in behalf of our industry, I would again request that the 
Commission continue to recognize the status of the Philippines as a cooperating non-
member in the Commission, and look forward for the renewal of such status in this 
Meeting.  
 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by European Union  
 
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
  
The European Union is very pleased to be present at the annual meeting of the 
CCSBT. We would like to thank Australia for ghosting this meeting. 
 
The EU is committed to contributing to sustainable oceans and fisheries management 
in the best possible way. There is now full agreement between all the EU Member 
States and the European Parliament on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, 
which strongly aims at bringing fish stocks back at sustainable levels. 2014 will be the 
year for implementation. This reform also entails an important external dimension as 
any conservation policy makes little sense in isolation. 
 
A priority in the EU’s external fishery policy is to develop and support governance 
systems through international cooperation at multinational levels, among other things 
by contributing to the process towards ensuring the best possible functioning of 
RFMOs that will allow them to deliver against their mandate. 
 
As an active member of 15 RFMOs and as Cooperating Non-Member to the CCSBT, 
the EU continues to be committed to ensuring compliance with conservation and 
management measures. The EU is also striving for ensuring the best data for fishing 
activities, as data provides the stepping stone for the scientific advice on which 
fisheries management decisions are based. 
 
We continue to seek ways of improving the timely submission of data as regards the 
unavoidable by-catches of SBT taken by EU long line vessels. Great efforts are made 
to keep those by-catches to the minimum, including training of vessel masters and 
crew. These efforts have been successful as could be deducted from the falling EU 
SBT catches. 
 
For any further improvements as regards reporting obligations, we look forward to 
working constructively with you in that regard. 
 
Finally, the EU would still very much like to extend its participation in CCSBT to full 
membership. 
 
We look forward to participating in this meeting and hope it will be a productive and 
successful.

Opening Statement by Humane Society International (HSI) 
 
 
Humane Society International (HSI) would like to thank the Commission for the opportunity 
to participate as an observer to these important discussions. At the last meeting, CCSBT19, 
HSI noted that with the agreement of the Management Procedure (MP) came the great 
potential for members to focus on the bycatch of Ecologically Related Species (ERS) and 
work to reduce the impacts of SBT fishing on these species. 
 
HSI has an interest both in the conservation status of the target species as well as the impacts 
of SBT on the wider environment. We want to see the target stock recovered with the greatest 
certainty. In light of the information presented in recent days we are concerned that the MP is 
based on incomplete and uncertain data, and we are pleased to hear that further work is 
underway within the ESC. So it is only prudent that the Extended Commission does not 
approve any recommended TAC increase and delay any decision until after the 2014 stock 
assessment. 
 
We look forward to members adopting the proposal for mandatory measures to mitigate ERS 
bycatch. This would be a significant step forward for CCSBT. The ongoing failure of CCSBT 
members to fully account for ERS mortalities or report on mitigation uptake is a significant 
concern and must be addressed as a matter of urgency, through improved monitoring, 
compliance and surveillance.  
 
HSI further suggests that CCSBT members nominate which bycatch mitigation option each of 
their vessels has selected, which should be updated if any changes are made. This would allow 
for improved compliance monitoring and more accurate calculation of ERS bycatch, 
particularly of the 90% of vessels that are currently unobserved. 
 
We are concerned that without evidence of improved mitigation and its widespread uptake, 
any TAC increase will result in increased ERS mortalities. Remember, that for every two 
tonnes of TAC increase on longlines one more albatross will be killed, meaning a total of 515 
more albatrosses killed in 2014 and 842 albatross killed per year between 2015 and 2017. Of 
the 25 albatross and petrel species impacted by CCSBT fisheries 18 are threatened with 
extinction. Introduction of effective bycatch measures in these high risk waters deserves 
urgent action by CCSBT members. 
 
Thank you Chair and members for your time.

Opening Statement by TRAFFIC 
 
 
Thank you Mr. Chairman. 
 
TRAFFIC and WWF thank the Commission for the opportunity to participate as observers to 
meetings of the Commission, Extended Commission and its other subsidiary bodies.  We look 
forward to contributing to these critical deliberations.   
 
We recognise the work by the Commission in implementing the management procedure 
adopted in 2011 which has an interim rebuilding target of 20% of the original spawning 
biomass by 2035 and sets out to achieve that with a 70% probability. 
 
As we have noted previously, this is an interim target and we ask the Commission as a matter 
of urgency to remind itself of the precautionary principle and define the long term 
biologically safe target of rebuilding for the SBT stock, as the current discussions we will 
have this week around the next three years of TAC’s, allocations etc. are all based around an 
interim target.  
 
From an outside perspective looking in at this Commission, it is hard to ignore decisions 
being prioritized around increasing the TAC every year based on an interim target, with no 
apparent effort at looking to set a long-term target, and managing the catch to reach that target 
in the shortest possible timeframe. The generous offerings of increases in the TAC being 
discussed by the Commission now may in fact be tempered if we had our long-term target on 
the table. 
 
In regard to Ecologically Related Species (ERS), we welcome the progress made in the ERS 
working group this year, particularly in relation to sharks the progress on determining the 
stock status of the Southern Hemisphere population of porbeagle shark.  
 
As we are all aware, the recent listings under CITES of a number of important commercially 
fished shark species is highly relevant to CCSBT. These listings will come in to effect in 
September 2014, at which time a Flag State will only be able to issue a permit for trade if it 
can demonstrate that the provenance of the catch is both sustainable and legal.  
 
More broadly on ERS, we encourage the members to adopt the draft Resolution before this 
meeting so as to mitigate the impact on ERS species while fishing for SBT. 
  
We urge Members to make the necessary decisions, with the required sense of urgency, to 
conserve effectively SBT and other ecologically related species, especially sharks, seabirds 
and marine turtles. We believe that the right balance of conservation interventions made at the 
appropriate time will not only benefit SBT and ecologically related species, but also help 
ensure the ongoing sustainability of this commercially important fishery. 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Attachment 8 
 
Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
1. Dr. Kevin Sullivan (New Zealand) was agreed by Members to be the Chair of the Finance 
and Administration Committee (FAC). The Chair proposed a general agenda, which was 
agreed by the FAC. 
 
2. The FAC discussed the revised budget for 2013, and the proposed budget for 2014. The 
FAC also considered possible assistance to developing Members and CNMs. 
 
The revised budget for 2013 
 
3. The Executive Secretary gave a summary of the 2013 revised budget outlined in CCSBT-
EC/1310/05, highlighting major savings that had been made in relation to: 
• The Compliance Committee Working Group (CCWG2) meeting, which was held at a 
free venue in Canberra. The approved budget was based on holding the meeting in 
Tokyo, so significant savings had been made. 
• The Trial Quality Assurance Reviews (TQARs), which had been budgeted on the 
assumption that a Phase 2 (on-site) review would be conducted for two Members. 
However, the final agreed Terms of Reference for the TQARs only provided for 
Phase 1 (desktop) reviews, which meant the overall price was significantly lower. 
• The approved budget provided funds to assist the Secretariat conduct intersessional 
compliance work. However, these funds were not used. 
 
4. Additional savings for 2013 were also identified by the Executive Secretary in the FAC 
meeting: 
• Translation costs for the meeting documents (EC/CC) have been reduced to $5600 
from $10,000. 
• As no meeting was held by the Joint Tuna RFMO Bycatch Technical Working group, 
the participation costs of the chair of ERSWG were not incurred (a saving of $4800)1. 
• No payments have been made in 2013 from the fund to provide “Assistance to 
developing states”, a saving of $12,5001.. 
 
5. Final income for 2013 is estimated to be 0.7% higher than the amount approved at 
CCSBT 19 for 2013. The slightly increased income is due to a greater return on 
investments than expected in the approved budget for 2013. The importance of all 
members paying their full contributions to the CCSBT by the date required was noted by 
the FAC, as this has resulted in more effective use of term deposits and positive returns 
for the EC budget. 
 
6. The expenditure for 2013 is estimated to be 12% lower than the amount approved for 
2013. A surplus of $273K is now estimated for 2013, and it is proposed that this surplus 
be carried forward as income into the 2014 budget. The FAC thanked the Executive 
Secretary for the work done on the budget. 
 
7. The FAC recommends that the revised budget for 2013 at Annex A be agreed by the 
Extended Commission. 
 
                                                            
1 Note that an equivalent sum has been included in the proposed budget for 2014. 
 
 
 
 
 
The proposed budget for 2014 
 
8. The FAC considered the proposed budget for 2014 as outlined in CCSBT-EC/1310/06, 
and also a revision of this prepared by the Executive Secretary. The revision included 
updated estimates of expenditure costs based on the recommendations from the 
Compliance Committee (CC8) and decisions made by the Extended Commission (EC 20).  
 
9. The FAC discussed the cost estimates for a number of budget items and agreed the 
following recommendations on the major budget items: 
 
• Scientific Research Program Projects ($105,000): The FAC recommends to the 
Extended Commission that two of the three CCSBT funded projects proposed by the 
ESC be conducted in 2014, these being: Continued collection of close-kin samples 
($30,000) and a design study for future close-kin studies ($75,000). The FAC 
recommends that the other proposal, a design study for future gene-tagging ($75,000), 
be deferred until 2015.  The FAC requested the Secretariat to liaise with CSIRO to 
seek proposals for this work to proceed. Upon receipt of these proposals, Members 
agree to the above amounts being the maximum spending on these projects. The ESC 
will receive progress reports on these projects and a final report on the conclusion of 
the work. 
• Quality Assurance Review (QAR) ($100,000): During 2014, the CCSBT 
proposes to conduct further  QARs of Members. Depending on the number of phase 1 
and phase 2 QARs completed this sum may not be adequate to cover the full costs of 
the reviews. The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission approve that the 
Executive Secretary may spend up to 30% additional funding, drawn from the cash 
reserves, to fully fund the reviews as necessary. The increased costs of the QARs in 
2014 are because of the need for on-site verification of the initial reviews in phase 2. 
• Performance Review of the CCSBT ($75,000): CCSBT 19 agreed that the next 
performance review of the CCSBT would be conducted during 2014. The cost of this 
review is unknown: the proposed budget is an approximation based on the 
engagement of three independent panel members to undertake the review. 
 
10. The FAC considered the proposed meeting program for 2014. The FAC recommends to 
the Extended Commission, that:  
 
(i) 
A five day Compliance Committee Working Group (CCWG) meeting to be held
in Busan on a date to be decided around April 2014. A venue, interpretation soun
system, all equipment, office supplies and catering will be provided free of charge 
by the Korean Government, thereby significantly reducing the cost to the CCSBT. 
(Cost ~$89,000) 
 
d 
’s 
ce 
 
(ii) 
A four day scientific technical meeting be held in Seattle (July 2013). The ESC
workplan for 2014 includes a small technical meeting to progress the full SBT 
stock assessment that is scheduled for 2014 and to update the Operating Model in 
advance of the ESC meeting. Three of the independent Advisory Panel members 
and a technical consultant would be required. (Cost ~$68,000) 
 
(iii) 
The annual meetings of the Extended Scientific Committee, the Complian
Committee and Extended Commission be planned and budgeted as proposed in 
CCSBT-EC/1310/06. 
 
 
 
The FAC noted the Scientific Committee’s advice that all four members of the 
independent advisory panel be required for the ESC meeting in 2014. The FAC 
recommends that the Extended Commission fund a four member Advisory Panel in 
2014.  
 
Funding of scientific aerial survey 
 
11. The FAC discussed Australia’s proposal for the Commission to increase funding for the 
scientific aerial survey. It was noted that because of the budgetary constraints faced by 
some Members, it was not possible to agree to increase funding for the survey work at 
this time. However, the FAC agreed to recommend to the Extended Commission that an 
amount of $100,000 (excluding GST) be made available in the 2014 budget to partially 
fund the aerial survey work (i.e. at the same level as in 2013). 
 
12.  It was further agreed that payment of the amount of $100,000 towards the costs of the 
scientific aerial survey would be made by the Secretariat to the Australian Government 
Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) on receipt of an invoice from 
DAFF and notification to the Secretariat by DAFF of successful completion of the 
scientific aerial survey. 
 
Assistance to developing Members and CNMs 
 
13. The FAC agreed that an amount of $12,500 should again be allocated in the 2014 General 
Budget to assist developing Members and CNMs by supporting their attendance in 
relevant workshops and to also be used by the Commission to fund training and 
workshops held for developing Members and CNMs. 
 
14. Developing Members and CNMs can apply intersessionally to use the funds and the 
Secretariat would provide those funds subject to intersessional agreement by the 
Members. 
 
Recommended Budget 2014 
 
15. The FAC agreed to recommend the General Budget for the Extended Commission in 
2014 as set out in Annex B to this document. The Extended Commission is asked to note 
that the recommended Budget will result in a 5.3% increase in Member contributions.

Terms of Reference for the 2014 Quality Assurance Review Programme 
for the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna  
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) is an 
intergovernmental organisation responsible for the management of southern bluefin tuna 
throughout its distribution.  Members of the Extended Commission comprise: Australia, the 
Fishing Entity of Taiwan, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea and New Zealand.  
Cooperating Non-Members (CNMs) of the Extended Commission comprise: the Philippines, 
South Africa and the European Union.  Within the remainder of this document all references 
to Members includes Cooperating Non-Members. 
 
The CCSBT's objective is to ensure, through appropriate management, the conservation and 
optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna.   
 
The purpose of CCSBT Quality Assurance Reviews (QARs) is to provide independent 
reviews to help Members identify how well their management systems function with respect 
to their CCSBT obligations and to provide recommendations on areas where improvement is 
needed.  It is further intended that QARs: 
• Benefit the reviewed Member by giving them confidence in the integrity and 
robustness of their own monitoring and reporting systems; 
• Promote confidence among all Members as to the quality of individual Members’ 
performance reporting; and 
• Further demonstrate the credibility and international reputation of the CCSBT as a 
responsible Regional Fisheries Management Organisation. 
 
The Extended Commission may consider the outcomes of QARs for fisheries management 
decision making.  
 
The 2014 QAR programme has a significant development and continuous improvement 
dimension.  Consequently, in addition to the purposes of a QAR described above, the 2014 
QAR Programme is intended to: 
• Develop and test a methodology for Phase 2 use in this and future QARs;  
• Demonstrate the value (or otherwise) of QARs for the CCSBT; and 
• Identify issues that may arise in the implementation of QARs. 
 
 
2. SCOPE 
The QARs will review the suitability of Members’ systems and processes for ensuring 
compliance with the following measures: 
i) National allocations;  
ii) Catch Documentation Scheme; and  
iii) Transhipments 
In particular, the reviews will determine whether Members’ systems and processes meet 
CCSBT’s minimum performance requirements for these three measures.1  
 
The reviews will be focused on government systems and processes, and will not involve 
reviews of any industry systems nor consultation with a Member’s industry, except at the 
discretion of the Member.  Consultation is to take place with nominated government officials 
and if applicable government-authorised third party service providers involved in the 
management of SBT 
 
In assessing the suitability of systems QARs will take into account the particular 
circumstances and characteristics of each Member being reviewed.  QARs will also take into 
account any issues identified by the Compliance Committee.  All QARs will provide an 
overall review of the Members monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) systems however 
some areas may need particular attention based on the Members involved, including: 
i) Market States – emphasis will be placed on the systems and processes in place to 
support requirements for the importation of SBT products; 
ii) Farm States – emphasis will be placed on the systems and processes required for 
accurate reporting of catch, monitoring the introduction of SBT into farms 
including the effectiveness of the 100 fish sampling methodology and the 
harvesting of farmed SBT product; 
iii) Developing States – emphasis will be placed on the systems and processes in place 
required to monitor, manage and accurately report artisanal and industrial catch 
including to address Indonesia’s request for consideration of its allocation; and 
iv) Distant Water Fishing States – emphasis will be placed on the systems and 
processes in place for the accurate reporting of catch, recording/verifying of 
landing and/or transhipment and monitoring of direct exports of SBT.  
 
Any compliance risks agreed by the Extended Commission shall be provided to the reviewers 
by the Executive Secretary.   
 
Phase 1 QARs for Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand took place in 2013.  
 
The 2014 QAR Programme will include: 
i) Taiwan (Phase 1); 
ii) Indonesia (Phase 1 and 2); and 
iii) Australia (Phase 2) 
 
3. LANGUAGE 
The review teams shall include at least one member which meets the language requirement of 
the Member state being reviewed. 
 
4. REVIEW PROCESS 
The review company is required to develop the methodology for the Phase 2 reviews.  The 
methodology that the company intends to use should be detailed in its proposal to the 
CCSBT. 
 
4.1 Phase 1 Reviews 
                                                 
1 Members can find these on the CCSBT website 
The purpose of a Phase 1 QAR is to independently document and evaluate Members’ systems 
and processes to meet relevant minimum performance requirements of CCSBT measures.  
 
The reviewer must evaluate the Member’s current MCS systems and processes, and assess 
the following matters: 
• What systems and supporting processes are in place for ensuring compliance with national 
allocations of the SBT Total Allowable Catch (TAC)?  
• Are the systems and processes fit for purpose?  
• Do the systems meet CCSBT obligations in terms of the CCSBT’s minimum performance 
requirements? 
• Are any changes or improvements to current MCS systems underway or being planned? 
• Have any corrective or preventative measures been taken in response to compliance 
monitoring? 
 
It is expected that the review will involve the following general steps: 
• Analysis of existing documentation, in particular the most recent National Report 
submitted to the CCSBT by the Member (these can be obtained from the CCSBT 
Secretariat on request); 
• Building an initial process map of systems in place; 
• Consultation with the Member (via electronic means – e-mail or telephone) to verify the 
general accuracy of the initial process map, clarify areas of uncertainty and seek any 
additional information required to complete the process map; 
• Finalise the process map; 
• Conduct a SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities, threat/risk) analysis; and 
• Develop recommendations and prepare a draft report. 
 
4.2 Phase 2 Reviews 
Phase 2 is an on-site inspection of the Member’s MCS systems and processes documented 
in the Phase 1 QAR.  The purpose of the Phase 2 QARs is the independent verification of 
the existence and effectiveness of Members’ systems and processes. During Phase 2, the 
reviewer is expected to assess: 
• Whether the documentation of systems and processes in Phase 1 is correct and 
whether the documentation accurately reflects the systems and processes that are 
actually in place? 
• Whether these systems and processes are effective to ensure that Members meet their 
obligations?  
• Whether there is any possible further improvement of each Members compliance 
systems and processes, taking into account the results of the assessments listed above. 
 
It is expected that Phase 2 will involve the following general steps: 
• Development of a site visit, interview and testing plan based on the outcomes of 
Phase 1; 
• A visit to the principal site(s) where the Member’s main systems and processes are 
located and: 
o Interviews of the key people involved in the operation of these systems and 
processes; and 
o Verifying operation and effectiveness of systems and processes with objective 
evidence such as demonstrations of how the systems work/function in practise; 
• Modify the process map and SWOT analysis from Phase 1 as appropriate;  
• Produce a gap analysis between Phase 1 and Phase 2 QAR findings; and 
• Develop recommendations for the overall review (Phase 1 & 2) and prepare a draft 
report. 
 
5. REPORTS 
The final outputs from the reviewing company will be individual QAR Reports for each 
Member undertaking the reviews and one Final Report of the 2014 QAR Programme.   
 
5.1 Individual QAR Reports 
A separate report is to be prepared for the QAR of each Member.  The report will include 
both Phases of the review for those Members that undergo both Phases.  Each report is to 
describe the findings of the review of that Member’s systems, including the process map, 
analysis of the suitability of the systems and recommendations for improvements.  It 
should also include any variations in the methodology used to conduct the specific QAR, 
noting that the full methodology will be provided in the Final Report of the 2014 QAR 
Programme. 
 
The following process and timeline should be followed in preparing each of the QAR 
reports2: 
• The reviewer will provide the draft report to the relevant Member by 30 May 20143; 
• The Member may seek clarification from the reviewer concerning the draft report and 
may provide comments to the reviewer on any aspect of the draft report, particularly 
in relation to factual errors and omissions.  The Member’s comments should be 
provided to the reviewer within 8 weeks of receiving the draft report and no later than 
31 July 2014; 
• The reviewer will correct any factual errors reported by the Member.  The reviewer 
will also consider other comments provided by the Member and make modifications 
to the report as the reviewer considers appropriate;   
• The reviewer will provide the finalised report to the Member and to the CCSBT 
Executive Secretary no later than 31 August 2014.  The table of contents of the 
finalised individual QAR Report will include provision for an attachment at the end of 
the report to be provided by the Member containing comments that the Member 
wishes to make in relation to the outcomes of the QAR; and 
• The Secretariat will provide a feedback form in relation to the reviewers’ 
performance, to Members. 
 
5.2 Final Report on the 2014 QAR Programme  
The reviewing company is to provide a final report of the overall 2014 QAR Programme, 
containing: 
• A detailed description of the methodology used for the QARs.  The methodology 
needs to be in sufficient detail to enable the QARs to be repeated with other Members, 
or with the same Members but for different CCSBT obligations; 
                                                 
2 These timeframes are necessary in order for the finalised individual QAR Reports to be commented on and distributed in 
time for consideration by the Annual Meeting of the CCSBT Compliance Committee, which will be held from October 
2014. 
3 It should be re-iterated that the QAR is intended to be for the benefit of the Member and that discussion and feedback 
between the Member and reviewer during the review period is encouraged.  Consequently, the Member will hopefully be 
aware of any significant outcomes before receiving the draft report. 
• A description of issues encountered during the reviews (including benefits and 
limitations of the approach and methodology used in the programme); and  
• Recommendations for future QARs, including any improvements of the methodology.   
 
The final report on the overall 2014 QAR Programme is to be provided to the CCSBT 
Executive Secretary by 31 August 2014. 
 
6. CONFIDENTIALITY, COPYRIGHT and INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) 
In carrying out the reviews the reviewers will have access to confidential and commercially 
sensitive information. 
With the exception of the finalised individual QAR reports and the 2014 QAR Programme 
Final Report, all information and material obtained or produced by the reviewing company 
and individual reviewer(s) during the course of conducting a QAR is confidential between the 
reviewer and the relevant CCSBT Member and shall not be released by the reviewing 
company or reviewer(s) to any other party either during or after conducting the QARs.  The 
reviewing company and reviewer(s) will be required to make a declaration to this effect. 
 
The finalised individual QAR reports and the 2014 QAR Programme Final Report will be 
subject to the CCSBT confidentiality requirements for documents submitted to a meeting of a 
subsidiary or advisory body of the Commission as described in Rule 104 of the CCSBT’s 
Rules of Procedure.   
 
The CCSBT will own exclusive copyright of each report and will have the right to reproduce 
each report (including any part thereof) and make each report publicly available at its sole 
discretion.  The CCSBT will also own the IP for methods and techniques developed in the 
process of conducting the reviews and will be able to re-use these methods as it chooses. 
 
7. QUALIFICATIONS OF REVIEWING COMPANY AND REVIEWERS 
Reviewers will be expected to have sound knowledge of fisheries management and fisheries 
monitoring, control and surveillance systems.  Reviewers will also have extensive experience 
of auditing/reviewing such systems.  The reviewing company is required to clearly 
demonstrate in its proposal to the CCSBT that its reviewers have this knowledge and 
experience, that it can operate in  English or Japanese, and the language of the Member being 
reviewed, and that the company and its reviewers are appropriately qualified to ISO 
9001/ISO 17065 standard or similar, with relevant accreditation.  The reviewing company 
must also be independent (i.e. no conflict of interest) of the agencies being reviewed. 
 
The reviewing company and the name and qualifications of the reviewers will be advised to 
the Member being reviewed prior to the review taking place.   
 
8. MANAGEMENT OF QAR PROGRAMME 
It is intended to use Global Trust Certification for the 2014 QAR Programme. 
 
The following roles and responsibilities for the effective implementation of the 2014 QAR 
programme have been identified:

fisheries 
Purpose 
To provide advice to CCSBT-ERSWG on feasible, practical, timely, and effective technical 
approaches for measuring and monitoring the effectiveness of seabird mitigation measures in 
SBT longline fisheries. This does not detract from the need to implement effective seabird 
bycatch mitigation measures in line with the recommendations under agenda item 10 of 
ERSWG10. 
 
Composition 
Participation is open to representatives of Members and CNMs, Birdlife International and 
ACAP with technical, and scientific and other expertise concerning approaches for measuring 
and monitoring the effectiveness of seabird bycatch mitigation measures. 
Participation is also open to other invited experts whose particular expertise would make a 
beneficial contribution to the work being undertaken. 
 
Activities 
1. Preparation of a scoping paper that considers approaches for monitoring the effectiveness 
of seabird mitigation measures in SBT longline fisheries taking into account, among other 
things: 
• proposed elements for monitoring the effectiveness of seabird bycatch mitigation set 
out in CCSBT-ERS/1308/17(Rev.1) 
• need for both immediate and longer-term approaches for monitoring effectiveness 
• the feasibility, practicality, timeliness and effectiveness of any proposed approaches 
for monitoring effectiveness 
• ways of conducting retrospective analyses of existing data on seabird bycatch 
mitigation to test developed methods of measuring and monitoring 
• ways of extending monitoring across other tuna RFMOs and bodies with 
responsibility for seabird bycatch mitigation in longline fisheries 
• need to finalise the scoping paper to timelines for ERSWG-11. 
2. Conduct of an intersessional workshop involving the participants to discuss ways to 
measure and monitor the effectiveness of seabird bycatch mitigation measures in longline 
fisheries and to inform the development of the scoping paper. 
3. Participants will develop the scoping paper collaboratively. 
 
Review 
These terms of reference will be reviewed by the Ecologically Related Species Working 
Group and Extended Commission during their next ordinary sessions with a view to 
developing terms of reference for additional work towards implementing the approaches for 
monitoring the effectiveness of seabird mitigation measures in SBT longline fisheries set out 
in the scoping paper. 
 
Resourcing 
The workshop will be conducted in English without interpretation.  The workshop will be 
supported by the host Member with minimal involvement of the CCSBT Secretariat.

Attachment 14 
DRAFT RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH AN EXTENDED COMMISSION AND AN 
EXTENDED SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE 
 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (the Commission): 
 
RECOGNISING that ensuring the sustainability of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) stock 
requires that all those States, regional economic integration organisations and entities or 
fishing entities fishing this species work together through the Commission; 
 
CONSIDERING that continued fishing for SBT by States, regional economic integration 
organisations and entities or fishing entities not adhering to the Commission's conservation 
and management measures substantially diminishes the effectiveness of those measures; 
 
RECOGNISING the continuing need to encourage all States eligible to accede to the 
Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (the Convention) to do so, and to 
encourage regional economic integration organisations and entities or fishing entities with 
vessels fishing for SBT to implement the Commission's conservation and management 
measures; 
 
Decides as follows: 
1. Acting under Articles 8.3(b) and 15.4 of the Convention, the Commission hereby 
establishes an Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (the 
Extended Commission) and an Extended Scientific Committee, whose Members shall be 
comprised of the Parties to the Convention and any regional economic integration 
organisation, entity or fishing entity, vessels flagged to which1 have caught SBT at any time 
in the previous three calendar years, that is admitted to membership by the Extended 
Commission pursuant to this Resolution. 
 
2. The Extended Commission and the Extended Scientific Committee shall perform the same 
tasks as the Commission and the Scientific Committee including, but not limited to, deciding 
upon a total allowable catch and its allocation among the Members. All Members shall have 
equal voting rights.  A regional economic integration organisation that is a Member shall 
have one vote and its member States shall have no right to vote in the Extended 
Commission2.  The provisions of the Convention relating to the Commission and the 
Scientific Committee (Articles 6 to 9, except for 6.9 and 6.10) shall apply mutatis mutandis 
with regard to the Extended Commission and the Extended Scientific Committee. Any 
dispute concerning the interpretation or implementation of this Resolution, including the 
articles of the Convention specified in the Resolution, or the Exchange of Letters referred to 
in paragraph 6, shall be resolved by negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration 
or other peaceful means agreed by the parties to the dispute. 
 
3. The Secretariat of the Commission shall function as the Secretariat of the Extended 
Commission. 
 
 
                                                            
1 Including vessels flagged to a State that is a Member of the regional economic integration organisation. 
2 This lack of voting right in the Extended Commission does not apply to a member State of a regional economic integration 
organisation that becomes a Member of the Commission in representation of one of its territories that is not part of the 
regional economic integration organisation. 
4. The Extended Commission shall report forthwith to the Commission if the latter is in 
session, and in any other case before the latter’s next meeting or session of a meeting, all 
decisions it adopts. Decisions so reported shall become decisions of the Commission at the 
end of the session of the meeting to which they were reported, unless the Commission 
decides to the contrary. Any decision of the Commission that affects the operation of the 
Extended Commission or the rights, obligations or status of any individual Member within 
the Extended Commission should not be taken without prior due deliberation of that issue by 
the Extended Commission. 
 
5. The Rules of Procedure for the Extended Commission shall be as annexed to this 
Resolution. Any revision to the Rules shall be made by the Extended Commission. 
 
6. Any regional economic integration organisation, entity or fishing entity, vessels flagged to 
which1 have caught SBT at any time in the previous three calendar years, may express its 
willingness to the Executive Secretary of the Commission to become a member of the 
Extended Commission. The Executive Secretary of the Commission, on behalf of the 
Commission, will conduct an Exchange of Letters with the representative of such regional 
economic integration organisation, entity or fishing entity to this effect. In so doing, the 
applicant shall give the Commission its firm commitment to respect the terms of the 
Convention and comply with such decisions of the Extended Commission as become 
decisions of the Commission pursuant to paragraph 4. 
 
7. In deciding whether to admit an applicant, the Extended Commission shall evaluate the 
commitment provided by the applicant at paragraph 6 together with the applicant’s record of 
compliance with decisions of the Extended Commission. 
 
8. If the Extended Commission decides to admit the applicant, it shall negotiate with the 
applicant a formula to govern the level of catch of SBT by the applicant pending the next 
decision of the Commission setting a total allowable catch and its allocation among the 
Members. Upon the successful completion of the negotiations referred to in the previous 
sentence, the Executive Secretary will exchange letters with the applicant as referred to in 
paragraph 6; the applicant shall thereupon assume the status of Member of the Extended 
Commission. 
 
9. Any Member of the Extended Commission that is not a Member of the Commission shall 
be entitled to appoint one representative, to be accompanied by experts and advisers, as an 
Observer to meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies, including the Scientific 
Committee. Such representative shall be entitled to be present and speak as an Observer at 
meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies. 
 
10. The Extended Commission shall decide upon an annual budget. The contributions to the 
budget of an applicant that is admitted as its Member shall be determined by application 
mutatis mutandis of Article 11 of the Convention. 
 
11. The provisions of this Resolution relating to participation by regional economic 
integration organisations and entities or fishing entities in the operations of the Extended 
Commission are solely for the purposes of the Convention. 
 
12. For the purposes of this Resolution, ‘regional economic integration organisation’ means a 
regional economic integration organisation to which its member States have transferred 
competence over matters covered by the Convention, including the authority to make 
decisions binding on its member States in respect of those matters. 
 
13. This Resolution replaces the Resolution to Establish an Extended Commission and an 
Extended Scientific Committee of 20 April 2001 (the 2001 Resolution), which is hereby 
repealed. Any entity or fishing entity admitted as a Member through an Exchange of Letters 
under the 2001 Resolution shall continue as a Member of the Extended Commission under 
this Resolution.

CCSBT Observer (Korea) 
 
1. The Ninth Regular Session of the Commission for the Conservation and Management of 
Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC9) took 
place from 2-6 December 2012 at Manila, Philippines, attended by 40 Members and 
Cooperating Non-Members (CNMs), 10 inter-governmental organizations and 14 non-
governmental organizations.  
 
Matters directly related to the CCSBT were not discussed at the meeting. 
 
Major Issues Discussed 
 
2. Major agenda items included: 1) IATTC/WCPFC Overlap Area issues; and 2) 
REPLACEMENT MEASURE FOR CMM 2008-01 / CMM 2011-01 (tropical tuna measures).   
 
3. Regarding the overlap area issue, WCPFC9 agreed to accept the short and long-term 
process as follows: 
a. In the short term, the following applies: 
i. Vessels listed exclusively in the WCPFC record of Fishing Vessels shall apply the 
conservation and management measures of the WCPFC when fishing in the overlap area; 
ii. Vessels listed exclusively in the IATTC register shall apply the conservation and 
management measures of the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area; 
iii. In the case of vessels listed in the record/register of both organizations, the corresponding 
flag Member shall decide and notify to both Commissions under which of the two 
commissions those vessels shall operate when fishing in the overlap area, as regards the 
application, for a period of not less than three years, of the conservation and management 
measures of that Commission. 
iv. In the case of vessels listed in the record/register of both organizations, the vessels of a 
Cooperating Non-Member shall apply the conservation and management measures of the 
Commission of which it is a member, when fishing in the overlap area. 
b. Initiate in parallel a longer-term process through the establishment of a joint working 
group to explore avenues for managing tuna stocks in the entire Pacific Ocean 
 
4. Regarding tropical tuna measures, the participants had an extensive discussion on the 
Chair’s draft. Opinions varied on major components such as FAD management, capacity and 
effort limitation, restrictions by fishery types and observers and the Commission could not 
draw a consensus on a concrete measure. To address the situation, a small working group was 
formed to produce a recommendation for CMM2012-01, which would be a single-year 
                    Attachment 15
measure. WCPFC9 adopted the tropical tuna management measure produced by the SWG 
and edited by the plenary as CMM 2012-01. Japan proposed to host a working group meeting 
on the draft multi-year management program for tropical tunas in Japan prior to TCC9. 
WCPFC9 agreed that TCC9 would focus on the draft multi-year management program for 
tropical tunas and compliance issues. 
 
Other Adopted Measures (CMM) and Decisions 
 
4.  Measures on whale shark protection: 
WCPFC9 adopted a CMM on the protection of whale sharks from purse seine fishing 
operations. As this measure did not include handling and safe release guidelines, WCPFC9 
noted the need to continue development of such science-based guidelines through discussions 
at SC and TCC, including establishing field tests to assess handling, post-release mortality, 
practicality and effectiveness. 
 
5.  Charter notification extension: 
WCPFC9 agreed to extend the CMM on charter notification (CMM 2011-05) for a three-year 
period.  
 
6.  Pacific Bluefin Tuna measure: 
WCPFC9 adopted the NC’s recommended CMM for PBF noting that the measure will be 
reviewed in 2013 pending the results of the soon to be completed ISC stock assessment. 
 
7.  Amendment to the seabird measure: 
New Zealand introduced a proposal to mitigate the impact of fishing for highly migratory fish 
stocks on seabirds, which was designed to allow higher latitude areas to utilize the most 
effective seabird mitigation measures and to align WCPFC-approved mitigation measures 
with those in other tuna RFMOs. WCPFC 9 adopted this proposed amendment. 
 
8. WCPFC9 also agreed that the Commission will participate in the GEF ABNJ Sustainable 
Management of Tuna Fisheries and Biodiversity Project, with its in-kind co-financing in the 
amount of $6,347,000. 
 
Venue for Next Meeting  
 
At WCPFC9, no offers for hosting the meetings were forthcoming and the Chair tasked the 
Executive Director with determining the most economically and logistically attractive venue 
for each meeting. At the meeting, it was decided that FSM would host the meeting as a 
default venue, but later, Australia offered to host WCPFC10 in Cairns from December 2-6, 
2013. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
REPORT FROM THE CCSBT OBSERVER TO THE  
31ST ANNUAL MEETING OF THE COMMISSION 
FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC  
MARINE LIVING RESOURCES 
 
(23 October - 1 November 2012, Hobart, Tasmania)

This paper is presented for consideration by CCSBT and may contain unpublished data, analyses, and/or conclusions subject 
to change.  Data in this paper shall not be cited or used for purposes other than the work of the CCSBT Commission, Scientific 
Committee or their subsidiary bodies without the permission of the originators and/or owners of the data. 
                   
 
 
 
 
REPORT FROM THE CCSBT OBSERVER (AUSTRALIA) TO THE  
31ST ANNUAL MEETING OF THE COMMISSION FOR THE  
CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC MARINE LIVING RESOURCES 
1. The thirty-first meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine 
Living Resources (CCAMLR XXXI) was held in Hobart, Tasmania from 23 October to  
1 November 2012. 
2. The following Members of the Commission were represented: Argentina, Australia, 
Belgium, Brazil, Chile, People’s Republic of China (hereafter referred to as China), 
European Union, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Namibia, New 
Zealand, Norway, Poland, Russian Federation, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America and 
Uruguay. The Netherlands attended as a Contracting Party with observer status. Singapore 
and Vietnam attended as non-Contracting Parties with observer status. The Antarctic and 
Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC), the Coalition of Legal Toothfish Operators (COLTO) 
and the Association of Responsible Krill Fishing Companies (ARK) attended as invited 
NGO observers. Several international organisations were also represented.  
Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing 
3. The Commission discussed the evidence provided by Members on the current IUU 
activities in the CAMLR Convention Area. It was a general observation that IUU fishing 
continues at a relatively low level, although it was possible it was increasing and that the 
spatial distribution of IUU fishing may be changing.  
4. The Commission agreed that, given the uncertainty surrounding gillnet catch rates, future 
estimates of IUU should focus on the level of effort, rather the level of catches although 
estimates of total removals are needed for stock assessments. The Commission noted that 
gillnets were of particular concern due to the potential impacts on by-catch species and 
benthic ecosystems. 
Performance Review 
5. The Commission considered and reported on progress made on the recommendations from 
the 2008 Performance Review of CCAMLR. 
6. The Commission agreed that there had simply been insufficient time at this meeting to 
discuss many of the issues that were formerly considered in this agenda item. The need to 
consider the range of emerging issues faced by the Commission meant that there was little 
time to address fundamental and substantive issues. In order to address this, the Chair 
invited discussion papers to be submitted to the Commission in 2013.  
Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) 
7. The Commission considered two MPA proposals, one in the Ross Sea (proposed by USA 
and New Zealand) and the other for a representative system of MPAs in East Antarctica 
(proposed by Australia, France and the EU). The Commission noted the discussion and 
advice of the Scientific Committee on the proposals, however the Commission was unable 
to agree to either of these proposals. 
8. The Commission agreed to a proposal from Member to host a Special Meeting of the 
Commission and an intersessional meeting of the Scientific Committee in July 2013 to 
continue the Commission’s work in relation to MPAs for the following purposes: 
a. the Special Meeting of the Commission will consider MPA issues and make 
decisions, if possible, on the joint New Zealand and USA MPA proposal on the 
 
 
 
 
Ross Sea region and the joint Australia, France and EU MPA proposal on East 
Antarctica 
b. the meeting of the Scientific Committee will review and advise the Commission on 
the science already considered by the Scientific Committee and any additional 
available science relevant to assist the Commission’s deliberations on the 
proposals, in accordance with CM 91-04. 
Cooperation between CCAMLR and CCSBT 
9. The Commission endorsed the cooperative arrangement between CCSBT and CCAMLR.  
10. The Commission maintained that no fishing for southern bluefin tuna should occur in the 
CAMLR Convention Area without the vessel fully complying with CCAMLR 
conservation measures.  
11. It also noted the usefulness of CCAMLR sharing its experience in the reduction of seabird 
mortality with both CCSBT and WCPFC. 
CCAMLR Compliance Evaluation Procedure 
12. The procedure will use information already provided to the Secretariat, as required under 
the Convention, conservation measures and other rules and procedures such as the System 
of Inspection as well as provide an opportunity for Members to comment on the 
compliance with CCAMLR conservation measures. The procedure also gives the 
Secretariat a formal mechanism to capture and record information on the implementation 
of conservation measures by Members. Accordingly, the CCAMLR Compliance 
Evaluation Procedure was adopted. 
Other issues   
13. Other issues discussed at CCAMLR XXXI included new and exploratory fisheries; data 
poor fisheries; krill fishery management; and climate change.   
14. The Commission recognised that the initial contract of the Executive Secretary was due to 
expire on 18 April 2014. Expressing its satisfaction with the work of Mr Wright, the 
Commission, in accordance with Rule 14(a) of the Rules of Procedure, agreed that his 
office shall be extended for a second four-year term (to April 2018). 
15. The thirty–second annual meeting of CCAMLR will be held from 23 October to  
1 November 2013 in Hobart, Tasmania.

CCSBT-EC/1310/21 
Report from the CCSBT Observer to 
the 18th Special Meeting of 
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) 
(12 November – 19 November, Agadir, Morocco) 
 
CCSBT Observer (Japan) 
 
 
44 Contracting Parties and four Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities, 
seven non-Contracting Parties, five intergovernmental organizations and 25 non-governmental 
organizations attended the 18th Special Meeting of the International Commission for the 
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. 
 
No matter related to cooperation between ICCAT and CCSBT was discussed in the meeting.  
 
The Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) findings of possible improvement 
in the east Atlantic and Mediterranean stocks of bluefin tuna constituted one of the major 
incentives to the over 500 meeting participants, but other issues such as billfish, shark 
management and compliance performance were also high priorities for the Commission. With 
all eyes on ICCAT, the Commission lived up to its recent commitment to act responsibly by 
heeding the advice of its scientific community and maintaining bluefin tuna quotas at levels 
which would allow sustainable growth and recovery of the stock, and at the same time 
strengthening the control mechanisms in place. The importance of science-based management 
was also highlighted by the Commission’s commitment to the Atlantic-wide Research Program 
for Bluefin Tuna (GBYP), with measures proposed to ensure steady funding for this program. 
Although the complexities of the issue required the final decision of the funding mechanism to 
be deferred until 2013, parties undertook to continue the research through voluntary 
contributions. 
Billfish species were back on the agenda following the white marlin stock assessment in May 
2012, and the new management plan set clear limits on landings of blue marlin, white marlin 
and spearfish.  
South Atlantic swordfish measures were prolonged for a further year as stocks are due to be 
assessed in 2013. 
Also up for discussion were several species of sharks, which resulted in the strengthening of 
existing conservation and management measures by ensuring better reporting. 
 
Monitoring, surveillance and control (MCS) measures were given special attention, with the 
adoption of improved Port State Measures in order to close all doors to any illegal Atlantic tuna 
catches, and improved measures relating to at-sea transshipment.  
A timeframe was determined for the final implementation of the electronic bluefin tuna catch 
document scheme, and an inter-sessional meeting convened to develop, among other things, the 
framework for future traceability systems of other tuna species with a view to having new 
systems in place by 2015. 
Despite the increasing complexity of ICCAT conservation and management measures – with a 
staggering 101 reporting requirements for many Contracting Parties in addition to the 
implementation of MCS measures – the Compliance Committee noted a considerable 
improvement in compliance with management measures in 2012, with only seven of the 
Contracting Parties being identified as having some compliance deficiencies of serious concern. 
Recognizing that even this number is too high, greater efforts will be made in 2013 to facilitate 
the submission of data and other required information. 
In 2012, ICCAT spent around 222,000€ in assistance to developing States for capacity-building 
activities. These funds have been used to facilitate participation in meetings, training workshops, 
sampling and observer programs, and to recover historical logbook data. In addition to existing 
funds, a further 150,000€ has been pledged for 2013 from the Working Capital Fund, in addition 
to voluntary contributions, to ensure continued participation of developing States at ICCAT 
meetings and sustain the Commission’s policy of inclusiveness. 
2013 promises to be another full year for the Atlantic tuna agenda, with work to ensure the 
implementation of the ICCAT Regional Observer Programme for bigeye and yellowfin tuna 
(ROPTROP) in 2014, as well as revisions to the transhipment observer programme and the 
eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna observer programme (ROP-BFT), the switch to 
the electronic bluefin tuna catch document scheme scheduled for the start of the bluefin purse 
seine fishing season and the implementation of the new measures. As well as an inter-sessional 
meeting of the Working Group on Integrated Monitoring Measures, a joint Panel 2/Compliance 
Committee meeting will be held to review the members’ bluefin management plans. Other 
meetings include a West Atlantic bluefin tuna working group and a meeting of a Working Group 
to consider amendments to the ICCAT Convention, which was drawn up almost 50 years ago. 
The next annual meeting of ICCAT will be held in Cape Town, South Africa between 18 and 
25 November 2013.  
 
REPORT FROM THE CCSBT OBSERVER (CHINESE TAIPEI) 
ON THE 2013 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE 
INTER-AMERICAN TROPICAL TUNA COMMISSION 
 
1. The 2013 annual meeting (the 85th meeting) of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna 
Commission (IATTC) was held in Veracruz, Veracruz (Mexico) on 10 to 14 June 
2013. 
2. The Meeting was attended by representatives of 20 Members of the Commission: 
Belize, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, European Union, 
France, Guatemala, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Chinese Taipei, 
United States, Vanuatu, and Venezuela. Bolivia, Honduras, Indonesia and Cook 
Islands attended as observer. Several international organizations and 
non-governmental organizations were also represented. 
Cooperation between IATTC and CCSBT 
3. No matter related to cooperation between IATTC and CCSBT was discussed in the 
meeting.  
Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing 
4. The Commission decided to remove from the IUU list the Colombian-flagged vessel 
Marta Lucía R, and adopted the list without any other change. The updated IUU list 
has been posted on the website of IATTC. 
Adopted Resolutions 
5. Six resolutions were approved: 
(a) Multiannual program for the conservation of tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean 
2014-2016: The Commission agreed to extend the current conservation measures 
for tuna for the next three years. The length of the closures are maintained as 62 
days for purse seiner and the catch limit for longline fishing vessels are also 
maintained as the same in the past years. 
(b) Conservation measures for bluefin tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean: The 
Commission agreed that the commercial catches of bluefin tuna by all members 
and cooperating non-members (CPCs) during 2014 shall not exceed 5,000 metric 
tons. 
(c) Supplementary resolution on northern Pacific albacore tuna: The Commission 
requested all CPCs to report their catches and fishing efforts on north Pacific 
albacore in the past years, and requested the scientific staff to review and assess 
the effectiveness of the current effort-based approach for north Pacific albacore. 
(d) Collection and analysis of data on fish aggregating devices (FADs): The 
Commission requested all purse seine vessels fishing on FADs from 1 January 
2015, to collect and report the required information and to identify all FADs 
deployed or modified by such vessels. The Commission also sets principles for 
the design and deployment of FADs and prohibits setting of purse seine vessels 
on whale shark.  
(e) Data confidentiality policy and procedures: The Commission agreed upon the 
policy for releasing catch-and effort, length-frequency data submitted by CPCs 
and set up procedures for Individuals and scientific staff to access to confidential 
data.  
(f) Financing for fiscal year 2014: The Commission agreed its budget of 
US$6,554,232 for fiscal year 2014. 
Other Issues Discussed 
6. Several other proposals were also discussed, such as in-port inspection: minimum 
standards for inspections, conservation of hammerhead shark, conservation of sharks, 
procedures for selection of the director of the Commission, management of fleet 
capacity, amendment to Resolution C-11-07 on the process for improved compliance 
of resolutions adopted by the Commission, amendment of Resolution C-05-07 on 
IUU Vessel List, and the use of information on compliance. However, no consensus 
was reached on these issues.
