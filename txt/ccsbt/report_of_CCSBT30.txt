Report of the Extended Commission of the  
Thirtieth Annual Meeting of the Commission 
9 –12 October 2023 
Busan, Korea 
 
Agenda Item 1. 
Opening of meeting 
1.1. Confirmation of Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended Commission of the 
Thirtieth Meeting of the Commission 
1. 
Dr. Dae-Yeon Moon (Korea) was confirmed as the Chair of the Extended 
Commission of the Thirtieth meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna (EC 30), and Mr Tsu-Kang Wen (Fishing Entity of 
Taiwan) was confirmed as the Vice Chair. 
2. 
The Chair welcomed Members and observers and opened the meeting. The 
Chair advised that the meeting this year is the first in-person meeting of the EC 
since CCSBT 26 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and was pleased to be 
able to host participants. The Chair also noted that discussion for some agenda 
items had commenced in advance of the meeting by correspondence.  
3. 
The list of participants is provided at Attachment 1. 
 
1.2. Adoption of agenda 
4. 
The agenda was adopted and is included at Attachment 2. The Chair advised 
that a proposal for the introduction of a secondment program between the 
Korean government and the CCSBT will be discussed under Agenda item 15 – 
Other Business. 
5. 
The list of documents submitted to the meeting is provided at Attachment 3. 
 
1.3. Opening statements 
6. 
The Minister of Oceans and Fisheries of the Republic of Korea, Mr Cho Seung 
Hwan, provided his opening remarks, which are shown in Attachment 4. 
7. 
Opening statements were circulated in advance of the meeting and were taken as 
having been read. 
1.3.1. Members 
8. 
Opening statements by Members of the Extended Commission (EC) are 
provided at Attachment 5.  
9. 
New Zealand also took the floor to express its thanks to the Korean government 
for hosting this meeting. New Zealand also noted the importance of the meeting 
in terms of decision-making and looked forward to working collaboratively with 
other Members to reach a successful outcome. 
1.3.2. Observers 
10. 
Opening Statements by Observers are provided at Attachment 6. 
 
11. 
Birdlife International reminded Members of the key recommendations from the 
2021 Performance Review in relation to the ongoing issues with addressing 
seabird bycatch. 
 
Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
12. 
Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC meeting. 
13. 
The Report from the Secretariat was provided to the meeting as paper CCSBT-
EC/2210/04 and was considered during the pre-meeting discussion process. The 
report contained two matters for consideration by the EC as follows: 
• The reappointment of Dr Kevin Stokes for a third and final term as Chair of 
the Scientific Committee; and  
• The reappointment of Professor Sean Cox for a second term to the Scientific 
Advisory Panel. 
14. 
The Chair advised that Heads of Delegations have agreed to renew the 
appointments of Dr Kevin Stokes and Professor Sean Cox for another three-year 
term respectively and congratulated both on their reappointment. 
15. 
The meeting noted the activities of the Secretariat as reported. 
2.1. Proposed Amendments to CCSBT Staff Regulations 
16. 
Discussion for this sub-agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance 
of the EC meeting. 
17. 
The Chair advised that the Secretariat submitted paper CCSBT-EC/2310/05, 
which proposed amendments of the CCSBT Staff Regulations to align the Staff 
Regulations with modern staffing practices, better reflect current UN staffing 
rules, eliminate ambiguity, meet Australian employment regulatory standards, 
and bring additional transparency. 
18. 
The Chair recognised that some of the proposed changes may impact on future 
budgets and referred further discussion of this item to the Finance and 
Administration Committee (FAC). 
19. 
During pre-meeting discussions, one Member asked whether there would be 
increased staffing costs associated with the proposal. The Secretariat clarified 
that the proposal would not increase staffing costs and would in fact limit the 
future earnings of professional Secretariat staff. 
20. 
The meeting agreed to adopt the proposed revised CCSBT Staff Regulations, 
which is shown in Attachment 7. 
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
21. 
The Chair advised that the Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee 
(FAC) was announced intersessionally in Circular #2023/040. The Chair 
thanked Mr Neil Hughes for agreeing to Chair the FAC. It was also noted that 
the FAC has already commenced its work. 
 
22. 
The Executive Secretary provided a brief presentation of the draft revised 
budget for 2023 (CCSBT-EC/2310/06), the proposed budget for 2024 and the 
indicative budget for 2025 - 2026 (CCSBT-EC/2310/07). The Executive 
Secretary noted that the CCSBT is currently in a strong financial position based 
on the past accumulation of savings, particularly during the pandemic. 
23. 
For the revised 2023 budget, the Executive Secretary noted that: 
• All Members have paid their 2023 contributions to the CCSBT in full.  
• The total expenditure for 2023 is forecast to be approximately $3,371,558, 
which is a ~$207,542 (6%) saving on the amount previously approved for 
2023.  
• Income was also forecast to be ~$130,000 more than budgeted. 
24. 
For the 2024 draft budget, the Executive Secretary noted that proposed 
expenditure would put a significant strain on CCSBT’s financial position, and 
the Secretariat has put forward several areas of potential savings that will need 
to be considered by the FAC. 
25. 
Detailed consideration of the two budget papers was referred to the FAC. 
26. 
The FAC was convened to consider: 
• The revised budget for 2023; 
• The proposed budget for 2024;  
• The indicative budget for 2025 – 2026; and 
• Proposed Amendments to CCSBT Staff Regulations. 
 
3.1. Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
27. 
The EC thanked the FAC Chair and the FAC for its hard work.   
28. 
The EC Chair also thanked CC Chair for his concessions regarding TCWG 
being merged with CC. 
29. 
One Member expressed concerns about significantly drawing down the 
Commission’s Contribution Stabilisation Fund (CSF) and also about the 
disparity between science and compliance spending. 
30. 
Members discussed whether savings could be made by making the OM 
development meeting virtual rather than in-person, but it was agreed the in-
person meeting provided an important capacity building opportunity, 
particularly for Indonesia. 
31. 
There was also consideration of whether EC 31 could be decreased from four 
down to three days, but it was agreed that a four-day EC meeting should be 
retained given that important discussions around future allocations were to 
commence in 2024. 
32. 
The EC adopted the report of the FAC, noting the revised 2023 budget (Annex 
A), approving the budget for 2024 (Annex B) and noting the indicative budgets 
for 2025-2026 (Annex B). 
33. 
The Chair of the FAC reported back the following key points from the Report of 
the FAC: 
 
• The FAC noted the 2024 budget includes a 5% increase in Member 
contributions. 
• The FAC supports the changes proposed to the Staff Regulations with the 
addition of travel days in the case of bereavement leave. 
• The FAC recommended the proposed Technical Compliance Working Group 
(TCWG) for 2024 be merged with the meeting of the CC as a cost saving. 
• The FAC recommended the EC approve a 2024 budget totalling 
approximately $4,244,400 as set out in Annex B, noting this will require 
approximately $600,000 from the CSF to balance income and expenses. 
• The FAC noted, with concern, that both the 2025 and 2026 budgets require a 
drawdown of Commission cash reserves, with the CSF completely drawn 
down by 2025.   The FAC highlighted that under all the funding scenarios it 
considered, an annual increase of Member contributions of around 5% will 
be required from 2025 onwards unless further reductions in expenses are 
achieved. 
• Regarding future meeting costs, the FAC agreed that Members consider 
either providing funds for costs above the amount identified by the 
Secretariat or agree their turn to host a meeting be replaced by a meeting in 
Canberra or other lower cost location. However, the FAC recommends that 
the current approach should be retained which allows final decisions 
regarding cost sharing and location of annual meetings to be made by the EC, 
subject to advice from the FAC. 
• After considering the Secretariat’s proposal to consolidate current part-time 
positions, the FAC recommended this not proceed, noting that additional 
support to the Secretariat may be available through Korea’s staff secondment 
proposal. 
• The FAC recommended the EC agree to a proposal from the Secretariat to 
improve transparency of financial accounting and to better align with 
existing requirements under the Financial Regulations by making an 
additional statement to Members as part of Year End Financial Statements to 
advise on the CCSBT’s net cash position and whether the potential exists to 
make a contribution to the CSF. 
34. 
The meeting agreed to revise the 2024 budget to reflect the decision to hold a 
four day EC and endorsed the report of the FAC provided at Attachment 8. 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries and ERS Interactions 
35. 
The Chair noted the deliberations of the CC and invited Members to ask any 
questions regarding Members’ national reports additional to those already raised 
at the Eighteenth Meeting of the Compliance Committee (CC 18).  
36. 
No additional questions were asked in relation to Members’ rational reports. 
 
4.1. Reports on Members’ projects 
37. 
The Chair invited Australia and Japan to provide an update on progress with 
trials for automated SV and Japan’s Market Proposal respectively.  
 
Automated stereo video (SV) trial by Australia 
38. 
Australia provided an oral update on its trial of automated stereo video (SV), 
noting that it was meeting the milestones set out in its 2022 Workplan. Phase 1 
of its Workplan is to test the accuracy of the SV camera and that was 
undertaken in Port Lincoln during 2023 where it was found that SV estimated 
fish lengths closely matched actual fish lengths, but also identified some issues 
to be further explored in phase 2, such as the length-weight key to be applied, 
and a small number of instances of counting the same fish twice or incorrect 
detection of fish. 
39. 
In February 2024, phase 2 of the project will test the ability of SV to operate 
under Australian farm operating conditions and be used to determine likely 
implementation costs. 
40. 
One Member noted that the introduction of SV has been an issue for many years 
and progress on SV has been previously cited as a key pre-condition to any 
TAC increase. 
41. 
Another Member asked if there were any obstacles foreseen regarding the 
completion of phase 2 of the trial, and whether the results could be reported 
earlier than EC 31.   
42. 
It was also suggested that Australia engage with other Members when 
developing its monitoring program. 
43. 
In response to the questions raised, Australia advised that: 
• No barriers to implementing the trial in 2024 were foreseen; 
• The report on the trial is due by June 2024 and therefore could be provided 
by Circular when available and by EC 31 at the latest;  
• It will provide as much transparency as possible about the trial; and 
• Monitoring program design is a significant piece of work that as outlined in 
the 2022 Workplan will progress beyond CCSBT 31 but Australia can 
provide an update at that meeting. 
44. 
Members thanked Australia for the update and acknowledged the progress 
made. 
Japan’s Market Proposal 
45. 
Japan provided an update on it Market Proposal noted that it was discussed and 
approved by CC 18 (CCSBT-CC/2310/19) and that some results had also 
already been reported (CCSBT-CC/2310/13). 
46. 
In response to a question, Japan advised that the study was examining only the 
markets in Toyosu and Yaizu since between them they represent the majority of 
the market share. 
47. 
Members thanked Japan for its work to date. 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working 
Group 
48. 
The Sixth Meeting of the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group 
(SFMWG 6) was held from 25 – 28 July 2023 in Tokyo, Japan, to consider 
 
recommendations from the 2021 CCSBT Performance Review along with 
advice from CCSBT’s subsidiary bodies in order to develop an updated draft 
CCSBT Strategic Plan (including a draft Five-Year Action Plan) for EC’s 
consideration. The full report of SFMWG 6 is provided at Attachment 9. 
49. 
On behalf of the Chair of the SFMWG, Mr Ichiro Nomura, the Secretariat 
presented paper CCSBT-EC/2310/09 summarising the outcomes of SFMWG 6 
including the draft Strategic Plan for 2023 – 2028. 
50. 
In response to a question from HSI about incorporating more modern fisheries 
management concepts into CCSBT’s Convention, New Zealand noted that 
updating the Convention would be a long and complex negotiation, but that the 
current Convention was not an over-riding constraint and that more could be 
done with the Convention in its current format.  
51. 
The EC agreed to endorse the SFMWG report and adopt the proposed Strategic 
Plan and its associated workplans, which is provided at Attachment 10.  
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
52. 
The independent Chair of the Compliance Committee (CC), Mr Frank Meere, 
noted that CC 18 was conducted in a very positive manner and thanked all CC 
18 participants (Members, observers, the Secretariat and the interpreters) for 
their efforts during the meeting, including thanking Members for responding to 
questions in the pre-meeting discussion documents. 
53. 
The CC Chair noted that the Fourth Meeting of Technical Compliance Working 
Group (TCWG 4) had been held immediately prior to CC 18 to review 
compliance risks and proposed Action Items for input into the Compliance 
Action Plan (CAP). This work was not completed and was continued by CC 18. 
54. 
The CC Chair presented the report of CC 18 (Attachment 11). 
55. 
The CC Chair highlighted some of the key Member compliance issues discussed 
by CC 18 which were: 
• South Africa’s various compliance issues relating to the Catch 
Documentation Scheme (CDS), non-provision of data, non-attendance of 
meetings, non-submission of national reports and non-submission of its 
Corrective Action Plan requested by EC 29; 
• The EU’s lack of attendance at meetings and failure to provide some national 
reports; 
• Japan’s lack of scientific observer coverage during 2022; 
• Korea’s lack of submission of some CDS import documents;  
• Indonesia’s ongoing non-compliance with CCSBT’s Transhipment 
Resolution; and 
• Insufficient observer coverage and data reporting on compliance leading to 
an inability to assess the levels of compliance of Members seabird bycatch 
mitigation measures. 
56. 
The CC Chair highlighted other important issues discussed including that: 
 
• CC 18 had continued but did not complete TCWG 4’s work and 
recommended the development of a CAP should continue intersessionally 
and be finalised at TCWG 5 (if convened)/CC 19 in 2024; 
• CCSBT’s Corrective Actions Policy (CPG3) was discussed and it was 
recommended to reconsider it in 2024 through a combination of an 
intersessional process and a possible TCWG 5; 
• For QARs, CC 18’s preferred approach was to utilise QARs for any new 
Members joining CCSBT and to also utilise targeted QARs if appropriate; 
• Japan’s market proposal was endorsed and Japan’s proposal to develop an 
open-access CCSBT webpage to search individual SBT information by CDS 
tag number was strongly supported; 
• It was agreed that consideration of the CDS Resolution (to take into account 
eCDS developments) be deferred until CC 19, and that the full 
implementation date for the eCDS be 1 January 2026 unless otherwise 
decided by the EC; and 
• Members noted progress with the Seabird Project and their willingness to 
engage with it. 
57. 
The CC Chair noted that CC 18’s recommendations to EC 30 included: 
• Adopting a set of High-Level Electronic Monitoring/Systems Guiding 
Principles for the CCSBT; 
• Adopting a revised CCSBT Authorised Vessel Resolution to collect 
information on whether vessels are authorised to fish outside waters under 
the national jurisdiction of the flag State; and 
• Adopting a revised strengthened Transhipment Resolution, which includes 
improvements already adopted by ICCAT and IOTC plus some elements 
from the UN-FAO Voluntary Guidelines as well as a two-year transhipment 
at-sea trial proposal for 17 Indonesia-flagged wooden carrier vessels 
including a targeted Quality Assurance Review (QAR) of the trial. 
58. 
Other CC 18 recommendations include that: 
• The Executive Secretary write to the EU to determine its continued interest 
in CCSBT and remind the EU that it is an obligation of all Members to 
submit annual reports and attend all Commission meetings; 
• Indonesia continue with its Payback Plan; and  
• South Africa provide a Corrective Actions Plan by 31 December 2023 to 
address areas on non-compliance, including providing the timing for the 
provision of outstanding data (before 15th meeting of the Ecologically 
Related Species Working Group (ERSWG) for ERS data) and national 
reports.  
59. 
Members thanked the CC Chair for his thorough report. 
60. 
Some Members noted that the lack of a High Seas Boarding and Inspection 
(HSBI) Resolution in the IOTC was an area of concern and encouraged 
Members who are also IOTC Members to try to facilitate the introduction of 
such a measure in the IOTC.  One Member noted that an IOTC HSBI proposal 
was likely to be made in 2024 but that previously such proposals had not been 
adopted.   
 
61. 
The EC Chair confirmed that EC endorsed CC 18’s report and all of its 
recommendations.  
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
62. 
The independent Chair of the ESC, Dr Kevin Stokes, presented the report of the 
ESC for the Twenty Eighth meeting of the Scientific Committee (ESC 28), 
which is summarised in papers CCSBT-EC/2310/11, and provided in full at 
Attachment 12. 
63. 
The ESC conducted a stock assessment in 2023, with key points as follows: 
• The 2019 Operating Model (OM) was used for tuning the Cape Town 
Procedure (CTP) such that the stock should reach 30% Total Reproductive 
Output (TRO) by 2035; 
• The baseline reference set of OMs in the 2023 Stock Assessment still result 
in a relative TRO estimate of 30% in 2035, with a range of 19-45%; 
• All sensitivity tests suggest that the CTP would ensure the stock does not 
decline, and all would be picked up through testing for exceptional 
circumstances; 
• A wide range of projections and sensitivity tests show similar or slightly 
more positive stock estimates for 2025, with some exceptions; and 
• Overall, the assessment is robust and accepted by the ESC. The stock is 
estimated to be on track to meet CCSBT objectives under continued use of 
the MP. 
64. 
The ESC Chair highlighted the key management recommendations from ESC 
28 were: 
• The ESC 27 recommended TAC for 2024-2026 is 20,647 t. 
• ESC 28 concluded that there is no reason to modify the 2024-2026 TAC 
recommendation on the basis of Exceptional Circumstances; 
• An allocation of 3.0 t be made in in 2024 to cover mortality associated with 
agreed research projects; and 
• In projections conducted at ESC 28 based on the new stock assessment and 
using all available data (see 11.3 of ESC 28), the ESC noted that (noting that 
this advice could change in future years): 
o The probability of the 2027-2029 TAC decreasing below 20,647 t, or 
increasing by 0-1,999 t is small; and 
o The probability of the 2027-2029 TAC increasing by 2,000-3,000 t is 
high. 
 
65. 
In response to questions from Members, the ESC Chair clarified that: 
• Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) changes between assessments because 
of changes in recruitment, fishing patterns, and other biological parameters, 
especially the estimate of natural mortality;  
 
• The F-to-Fmsy ratio compares current fishing to Fmsy, and indicates that 
current fishing levels are at about half the rate that could be achieved if the 
stock had recovered;  
• Unaccounted Mortalities (UAM) are estimated as best as can be done using 
indirect methods and are accounted for in testing of the Management 
Procedure (MP), not deducted from the total allowable catch (TAC); and 
• HSI questioned how EC can be better informed about any TAC increase 
implications for ERS species, in particular seabirds. 
66. 
The EC endorsed the report of the ESC and its recommendations. 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
8.1. TAC Determination 
67. 
The Chair noted that the ESC ran the Cape Town Procedure (CTP) in 2022 and 
has recommended a TAC of 20,647 t per year for 2024 to 2026, which is a 
3,000 t increase over the TAC for 2021 to 2023. The ESC recommended the 
adoption of this TAC at CCSBT 29, however, Members elected to defer this 
decision to CCSBT 30. 
68. 
The Chair also noted that Paragraph 2 of the Resolution on the Adoption of a 
Management Procedure states that “The MP shall be used to guide the setting of 
the global TAC for 2021 and beyond”, and the ESC 28 this year concluded that 
there is no evidence of exceptional circumstances and therefore confirmed the 
TAC recommended for 2024-2026 of 20,647 t/year. 
69. 
The meeting noted that measurable progress had been made by Australia and 
Japan with respect to the issues related to the implementation of SV monitoring 
and the Japan market study respectively. 
70. 
It was noted that it was important to implement the increase in the TAC that was 
the recommendation of the best available science, and that it was pleasing to see 
an increase that was a result of careful management of the stock. 
71. 
The EC agreed to adopt the global SBT TAC of 20,647 tonnes per year from 
2024 to 2026 inclusive as calculated by the MP and recommended by the ESC. 
 
8.2. Research Mortality Allowance 
72. 
The Chair noted that, at CCSBT 29, the EC agreed to continue 6 tonnes of fixed 
deduction from the TAC from 2024 to 2026 for Research Mortality Allowance 
(RMA) each year. The Chair advised that ESC 28 has endorsed the provision of 
the following amounts of RMA to cover research projects in 2023/2024: 
• 1.5 t for the CCSBT Gene Tagging Project;  
• 1.0 t by Japan for an age-0 distribution survey and an age-1 trolling survey in 
Western Australia; and 
• 0.5 t by Australia for the e-tagging project in the Great Australian Bight. 
73. 
The EC approved a total 3.0 t of RMA for 2023/2024 as endorsed by the ESC. 
 
 
8.3. Allocation of TAC 
Allocation of TAC 
74. 
The Chair noted that the TAC for 2024 to 2026 was to be determined at CCSBT 
29, however, the decision was deferred to CCSBT 30. In addition, CCSBT 29 
agreed that Indonesia would provide a proposal for revising the TAC allocation 
at CCSBT 30 for consideration by Members, and also noted that this proposal 
would be for a simple adjustment to the allocation percentages and not a 
proposal for a completely new mechanism. 
75. 
Indonesia presented paper CCSBT-EC/2310/17, which proposes an increase to 
Indonesia’s allocation. In its presentation, Indonesia emphasised its status as a 
developing coastal State with immediate access to SBT fishing grounds within 
its EEZ. Indonesia stated that it possessed a demonstrated ability for greater 
SBT catch but had been forced to limit its catch since joining this Commission. 
Indonesia also highlighted its efforts to develop monitoring systems, including 
the CDS, and contribution to the science process as evidence of its commitment 
to the management of the stock. 
76. 
Several Members raised the concern over the limited time to fully assess the 
proposal from Indonesia and to give it due consideration including its potential 
impact on the allocation of other Members.  Several Members also noted that 
many of the reasons that Indonesia put forward to support its request for an 
increase in its allocation percentage also applied to them, such as SBT being 
present in their EEZs, past higher historical catch, and socioeconomic impact. 
77. 
Members expressed sympathy for Indonesia’s situation and recognised its status 
as a developing coastal State. 
78. 
One Member sympathised with Indonesia’s difficulties in managing fisheries 
within its allocation but also cited this as a source of concern. 
79. 
Another Member expressed concerns about providing an increase to Indonesia 
prior to completion of its payback plan. 
80. 
Indonesia reminded Members of the flexibility it has shown in considering 
temporary solutions to the issue of allocation given its preference for a 
permanent remedy through a change in the allocation percentages currently 
found in the Allocation Resolution. 
81. 
Members expressed an openness to discussing a possible way forward to 
address the position that Indonesia is in, which may include a review of 
allocation percentages. It was suggested that long term arrangements could be 
considered next year providing a paper was put forward well in advance of the 
meeting (at least 60 days prior to the start of the meeting) to allow for 
consultations with stakeholders. It was noted that the next quota block would be 
the preferred timing for implementation of a change and that the earlier 
discussions started the better. Early discussion would be important for a 
proposal to succeed. 
82. 
Recognising that the EC agreed the CTP recommended TAC of 20,647 t and 
also agreed to deduct 6.0 t of RMA from the recommended TAC, the TAC 
available for allocation to Members will be 20,641 t. Members’ allocations of 
 
this available TAC in accordance with the Allocation Resolution is provided in 
the column (1) of table 1. 
83. 
In consideration of Indonesia’s situation, the EC agreed that a special temporary 
allowance of 130 t would be provided to Indonesia per year from 2024 to 2026 
inclusive. 
84. 
Korea noted that according to CCSBT’s Corrective Actions Policy (CPG3), a 
Member that has exceeded its catch limit is not eligible for an increase in its 
Effective Catch Limit1 until its excess catch has been paid back, unless 
otherwise agreed by EC. Korea noted that it could be argued that this situation 
applies to Indonesia, but would reluctantly join consensus in agreeing the 
increase for Indonesia. 
85. 
The special temporary allowance is subject to:  
• an annual review of Indonesia’s compliance undertaken at CC and an ability to 
revoke or reduce the temporary allowance; 
• this arrangement will expire at the end of 2026 and not extended beyond; and 
• not setting a precedent for, and being without prejudice to, future discussions 
on allocation and interpretation of CCSBT’s decisions. 
86. 
The annual review of compliance mentioned above will include evaluation of 
performance against obligations, including in areas such as: catch against 
allocation, transhipment, CDS, management of small-scale fisheries, data 
exchange requirements, and observer requirements. 
87. 
This is a temporary arrangement that does not affect Member’s allocation 
percentage within the Annex of the Resolution on the Allocation of the Global 
Total Allowable Catch.  
88. 
In addition, Japan has agreed to provide a voluntary transfer of 21 t to Indonesia 
and 27 t to South Africa each year for 2024 to 2026.

89. 
The EC agreed to the allocations specified in Table 1 and the conditions in 
paragraph 85 and 86. 
90. 
Indonesia expressed its appreciation to Members for their consideration and 
thanked Japan for its voluntary transfer. In addition, it provided the statement 
below: 
• Indonesia has taken reasonable approach and request in regard to allocation. 
Indonesia is not pushing forward the percentage change this year, as 
suggested in EC 29. Indonesia also counts on other possible option with the 
expectation that the minimum amount request to reflect the current and 
immediate need is fulfilled. Indonesia strongly believes that to be able to 
maintain and control of our healthy SBT fisheries management is through 
adequate allocation that truly reflects the capacity and dynamic of fishing 
fleet. Its population grows and demands for job, so do Indonesian fisheries, 
which provide significant socio-economic contribution. 
• Indonesia will continue its endeavour in the future for fair allocation, since 
this is the only sensible way out to avoid a series of most probable overcatch 
and to end up in permanent payback mechanism, and also avoid having 
prolong discussion on allocation. That is certainly inconvenient and 
unhealthy situation.  
• Furthermore, it is in its strong perspective that the percentage for quota 
allocation needs to be revisited next year. Indonesia is very much concern 
over this issue which entails the concerns and geographical position of 
Indonesia as a developing coastal state on the basis of relevant provisions of 
international law, among others, the United Nations Convention on the Law 
of the Sea as well as the Convention for the Conservation of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna. This urgent matter needs to be addressed in a timely manner 
and should receive a positive response considering the strategic and pivotal 
role of Indonesia sovereignty and sovereign rights as spawning ground and 
migration route of southern bluefin tuna to be conserved and managed. 
Amendment to the Allocation Resolution 
91. 
Japan presented paper CCSBT-EC/2310/18 on its proposal to amend the 
Resolution on the Allocation of the Global Total Allowable Catch, noting that 
Japan proposed further revisions to this paper during the meeting. In this 
proposal, Japan suggested revising provisions related to allocations for new 
Members or CNMs to remove any ambiguity and improve the procedures, 
considering the 2021 CCSBT Performance Revision Recommendations (PR-
2021-59 and 62). Japan further suggested maintaining the allocation for the new 
Member unchanged during the first three fishing seasons unless the EC decides 
otherwise. Japan also proposed removing the “nominal Catch” column from the 
Annex of the Allocation Resolution so that the actual quota is used as the basis 
for calculating Members’ contributions. 
92. 
Members collaborated on a revised draft of the proposal put forward by Japan 
and agreed to the amended resolution provided at Attachment 13. 
 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Ecologically Related Species (ERS) 
93. 
Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC.  
Update to CCSBT’s Resolution on Ecologically Related Species (ERS) 
94. 
The Chair advised that the Secretariat prepared paper CCSBT-EC/2310/13 
(Rev.1), which provides a draft update to CCSBT’s Resolution to Align 
CCSBT’s Ecologically Related Species measures with those of other tuna 
RFMOs to take into account decisions taken on ERS at the Annual Meetings of 
the ICCAT, IOTC and WCPFC. 
95. 
Birdlife International and ACAP noted the IOTC’s Resolution 23/07 on 
Reducing the Incidental Bycatch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries, which will 
enter into force on the 1 July 2024, has now added the use of hook-shielding 
devices (as a best practice measure) to the list of mitigation measures that can be 
used to reduce seabird bycatch. Hook-shielding devices can be used as a stand-
alone measure and should help prevent albatross and petrel bycatch. 
96. 
ACAP further noted that the most recent update of its best practice advice 
(endorsed at the 13th Meeting of its Advisory Committee - AC13 - in May 
2023), continues to recommend that the most effective way to reduce seabird 
bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries is to use the following three best practice 
measures simultaneously: (1) branch line weighting, (2) night setting and (3) 
bird scaring lines, or use of one of the assessed hook-shielding devices or the 
assessed underwater bait setting device. ACAP’s latest best practice advice also 
provided clarification of what constitutes night setting. ACAP noted that both 
the IOTC and the WCPFC had endorsed the use of hook shielding devices as a 
best practice mitigation measure. ACAP would be pleased to provide a detailed 
presentation on its updated best practice advice at ERSWG 15. 
97. 
HSI noted that it had been hoping that uncertainty around night setting be 
discussed at CC 18 and sought clarification on the mitigation intent of ICCAT, 
IOTC and WCPFC measures for sets which failed to be completed within the 
hours of darkness.  HSI also suggested that an individual and collective Member 
seabird catch reduction target and timeframe could help greatly in management 
of one species (SBT) into abundance increase whilst at the same time preventing 
further contribution to the extinction of others (seabirds). 
98. 
Australia noted that it was supportive of the use of hook-shielding devices and 
pleased that these had been included as an option in the IOTC’s ERS measure. 
Australia also noted its support for consideration of the use of best practice 
mitigation measures at ERSWG 15 in 2024, and was open to discussions about 
night setting. 
99. 
New Zealand noted that it is currently reviewing its domestic seabird 
regulations in the surface longline fleet, which will consider ACAP best 
practice. New Zealand is considering strengthened regulations (three best 
practice mitigations simultaneously or hook shielding devices) either spatially-
temporally or across all effort. It also noted the benefits of electronic monitoring 
 
(EM), particularly the potential to analyse information to provide better 
understanding of seabird interactions. 
100. Pew supported the views of other observers and suggested that the Commission 
consider the use of EM for monitoring ERS bycatch. 
101. The EC agreed to adopt the revised CCSBT ERS Resolution, which is provided 
at Attachment 14.  
Members’ performance with respect to ERS 
102. The Chair noted that the Secretariat’s report on Members’ performance with 
respect to ERS was presented to the CC in paper CCSBT-CC/2210/05.  
103. Members did not raise any issues under this agenda item. 
CCSBT Multi-year Seabird Strategy 
104. The Chair noted that the CCSBT’s Multi-year Seabird Strategy was adopted in 
2022 and invited Members to discuss the progress made to date. 
105. Members had no comments currently and the Chair noted this item can be 
discussed at ERSWG 15 in 2024. 
Agenda Item 10. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
106. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC.  
107. The Secretariat submitted paper CCSBT-EC/2310/14 which summarised the 
Secretariat’s interactions with non-Members since CCSBT 29. China, Fiji, 
Mauritius, Panama, Singapore and the USA were invited to attend this meeting 
and CC 18. 
108. The EC agreed to invite China, Fiji, Malaysia, Mauritius, Panama, Republic of 
Seychelles, Singapore, and the USA to participate as observers at CC 19 and 
CCSBT 31. 
109. The Chair thanked the United States for its continued cooperation with the 
CCSBT’s CDS.  The Chair also thanked the Republic of Seychelles for 
attending this meeting, which was appreciated. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
110. Discussion of this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of the 
EC.  
111. The meeting noted section 4 of paper CCSBT-EC/2310/15, which explains that 
the CCSBT has been approached by Mr Shingo Ota in his role as the Chair of 
the Catch Documentation Scheme Technical Meeting, which is a subsidiary 
body of the joint IATTC and WCPFC Northern Committee Working Group on 
the Management of Pacific Bluefin Tuna (JWG).  The JWG is seeking technical 
support from the CCSBT in the development of its electronic Pacific Bluefin 
Tuna Catch Documentation. The support requested includes the sharing of 
resources developed by the CCSBT for its eCDS system.  Discussions are 
underway between the various parties involved to develop an instrument that 
 
would allow technical sharing while recognising the Pacific Community (SPC) 
contribution to data and the CCSBT Secretariat will continue to support these 
discussions. 
11.1. Reports from other RFMO meetings of interest  
112. Members have acted as CCSBT observers at RFMO meetings of interest, and 
these Members have provided reports back to the CCSBT on matters of 
relevance in order to improve coordination with other RFMO.  
113. The following reports were provided by Members as part of their Observer 
duties for the CCSBT. 
• Korea’s report (CCSBT-EC/2310/24) to the 19th Regular Session of the 
Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC);  
• New Zealand’s report (CCSBT-EC/2310/23) to the 41st Annual Meeting of 
the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
(CCAMLR);  
• Indonesia’s report (CCSBT-EC/2310/19) to the 6th Special Session and 27th 
Annual Meeting of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC); 
• Japan’s report (CCSBT-EC/2310/20) to the 2022 Discussions on Essential 
Commission Business in Lieu of The 23rd Special Meeting of The 
International Commission for The Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT); 
and 
• Taiwan’s report (CCSBT-EC/2310/21) on the 2023 Annual Meeting of the 
Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission. 
114. It was agreed that the following Members would act as Observers to other 
RFMOs on behalf of CCSBT during 2023/24: 
• Korea to continue as Observer to WCPFC; 
• New Zealand to continue as an Observer to CCAMLR;  
• Indonesia to continue as an Observer to IOTC; 
• Japan to continue as an Observer to ICCAT; and 
• Taiwan to continue as an Observer to IATTC. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Confidentiality of Data and Documents 
12.1.   Confidentiality of reports and documents from 2023 
115. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC.  
116. The EC agreed that all the reports of meetings and documents submitted to 
meetings under the jurisdiction of CCSBT 30 would be made publicly available 
with the exception of Attachment A of paper CCSBT-ESC/2308/04 from the 
Secretariat titled “Secretariat Review of Catches” and the report from Trygg 
Mat Tracking (TMT) found at Attachment A of paper CCSBT-CC/2310/14 
titled “Potential Non-Member Fishing Activity/Trade & Trade Summaries”. 
 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Meetings for 2024 
117. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC.  
118. The EC agreed that the dates for the in-person ESC, CC and EC meetings in 
Taiwan during 2024 will be: 
• The 29th Extended Scientific Committee meeting, from 2 to 6 September 
2024;  
• The 19th Compliance Committee Meeting, from 3 to 5 October 2024; and   
• The 31st Extended Commission Meeting, from 7 to 10 October 2024. 
119. The EC also agreed that the 15th Meeting of the Ecologically Related Species 
Working Group (ERSWG 15) will be held as in-person meeting from 4 to 7 
June 2024 in Tokyo, Japan. It was noted that the timing of the meeting was 
before the 2024 ERSWG Data Exchange and that there were deficiencies in data 
for recent years, which would constrain progress of the ERSWG. New Zealand 
offered to bring additional information about hook-shielding device use in its 
fishery. 
120. New Zealand will host a hybrid virtual meeting of the ERSWG to advance risk 
assessment for seabirds. The meeting will be open to attendance by Members, 
but it is intended to be virtual. The date and venue will be decided 
intersessionally in consultation with the ERSWG Chair and Members, but it will 
be held before ERSWG 15. 
121. The EC agreed that the 14th Operating Model and Management Procedure 
Technical Group meeting (OMMP 14) be held during the week starting 24 June 
2024 in Seattle, USA. It was noted that this OMMP meeting is held in the 
context of the OM Specification and software upgrade project, and consequently 
the nature of this meeting is informal and will not produce a meeting report. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Election of the Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended 
Commission of the Thirty First Annual Meeting of the CCSBT 
122. The Chair advised that there were no nominations for the Chair and Vice-Chair 
of the EC, and that consequently, the Chair and Vice-Chair will be determined 
in accordance with past practice and the rotation of meetings. Therefore, Taiwan 
will be Chair of the EC and Indonesia will be Vice-Chair. 
123. The Chair requested that Taiwan provide its nomination for the Chair to the 
Secretariat as soon as possible. 
124. Indonesia nominated Professor Indra Jaya as the Vice-Chair for the EC 31 
meeting. 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Other Business 
125. Korea presented paper CCSBT-EC/2310/22 proposing to establish a 
secondment program to the CCSBT Secretariat from Korea. Korea 
 
acknowledged the pivotal role that the CCSBT plays among the tRFMOs by 
effectively managing fisheries and preserving ecosystem balance, and it viewed 
CCSBT as an ideal platform to both learn from and contribute Korea’s fisheries 
management expertise. Therefore, Korea proposed the establishment of a 
secondment program, allowing Korean staff to work within the CCSBT 
Secretariat, noting management rules to address various aspects of the program. 
126. Members were supportive of the initiative and its contribution to capacity 
building and the benefits of the extra capacity it would provide to the 
Secretariat. Members showed interest in extending the program to include other 
Members in the future. 
127. The main concern noted by Members was that of confidentiality of data. The 
Secretariat confirmed that there were no issues with constraining a secondee’s 
access to data and that this could be done in line with Members’ decisions on 
the scope and restrictions to apply to the secondee role.  
128. One Member asked a question regarding the level of experience of the 
candidates for the program, and Korean responded that a level did not have to 
be specified.  The key criterion was that the secondee had an appropriate level 
of expertise in fisheries matters.   
129. Members endorsed Korea’s secondment proposal and provisionally endorsed 
the MOU, subject to the details regarding the scope of the secondee’s work and 
the confidentiality agreement being shared with and approved by Members 
before the secondment starts.

Welcome/Opening Remarks  
by the Minister for Oceans and Fisheries Republic of Korea 
 
Excellencies, Executive Secretary Mr. Dominic Vallières, Chairperson of the 
Commission Dr. Daeyeon Moon, Distinguished delegates from Australia, Indonesia, 
Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, and the Fishing Entity of Taiwan, Respected 
observers, 
I extend my heartfelt congratulations on the 30th Annual Meeting of the CCSBT, and 
I extend a warm welcome to all of you here in Busan. 
Busan has had the privilege of hosting numerous international fisheries-related 
conferences. Consequently, some of you may have hoped for this meeting to take 
place in different locations. 
While Korea boasts many beautiful cities, Busan stands out as our nation's premier 
port city.  
It serves as a vital port of call for both coastal and distant water fisheries vessels.  
The bustling port and lively fish markets in Busan provide a unique opportunity to 
experience the dynamic energy of the fisheries community, right from the crack of 
dawn. 
For this reason, Busan holds a special place in the realm of fisheries, which is why, as 
the Minister of Oceans and Fisheries, I hold a deep attachment to this city. 
Moreover, I am delighted that an important conference like the CCSBT is taking place 
here in Busan, allowing me the privilege of addressing all of you today in this opening 
speech. 
Distinguished guests, 
The significance of this 30th Commission Meeting cannot be overstated.  
It marks our return to in-person meetings after three years of virtual gatherings 
necessitated by the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. Additionally, it marks the 
first meeting with our newly appointed Executive Secretary, Dominic Vallières. 
During this commission, we will deliberate on crucial matters such as the adoption of 
the TAC based on the outcomes of the MP and the subsequent allocation decisions.  
It is indeed a fortunate opportunity for us to gather in person for these important 
discussions. 
In accordance with the outcomes of the ESC meeting held this August in Jeju Island, 
we are encouraged to witness a positive trend in the SBT stock.  
This encouraging trend has led to a scientific advice for a 3,000 ton increase in the 
current TAC. 
While we anticipate further discussion, I wish to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all 
members and fishermen for their unwavering dedication and tireless efforts in 
contributing to the recovery for the SBT stock. 
CCSBT has showcased remarkable efficiency in stock management by implementing 
the MP at an earlier stage compared to other T-RFMOs.  
This is a legacy that all of you should take pride in. With this legacy in mind, I am 
confident that this year`s meeting, guided by the best available scientific information, 
will lead to highly productive outcomes. 
Esteemed guests, 
RFMOs today, including CCSBT, hold a critical position in shaping strategies for 
protecting by-catch species and preserving marine ecosystems, extending their 
responsibilities beyond catch allocation and fisheries management. 
In order to align ourselves with this global imperative, the Ministry of Oceans and 
Fisheries of Republic of Korea is committed to fostering close collaboration with 
RFMOs and reinforcing our national policies. 
We are eager to sustain and further this proactive approach through the course of this 
meeting. 
In closing, I wish everyone a productive and insightful week of discussions here in 
Busan.  
May you cherish the memorable moments created during your stay in our vibrant city. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Australia would firstly like to thank the Republic of Korea for hosting this year’s 
meeting, and our Chair, Dr Dae Yeon Moon, and the Secretariat for the meeting 
papers and arrangements, which are of the usual high standard, our excellent and 
patient translators and of course all other delegates and delegations.  
I understand Compliance Committee last week was very successful and held with a 
good spirit of cooperation. Australia sees compliance as a key aspect of the 
Commission’s work and we are pleased to see continuing improvement in how we go 
about this. 
This year the Commission will again be asked to agree catch limits for the next quota 
block, taking into account the very positive outcome of the Cape Town Procedure last 
year and the recommended maximum increase in global Total Allowable Catch.  
Australia strongly supports the close link between the Management Procedure and 
global TAC setting, not only this year with a proposed increase but also if we are 
asked to agree to reduce quotas to ensure stock rebuilding in the future. 
Last year Australia provided a work plan on our stereo video trial and we are pleased 
to note that we have met all the milestones of the plan. We will undertake the next 
stage of the stereo video trial in early 2024 and will report back to the Commission on 
this. 
Australia is proud to again take on the role of Chair the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC) this year. The work of the FAC is critical to for the Commission, 
and we note the broader backdrop of increasing cost pressures. We will work to find 
budget solutions for the next two budgets and seek to balance our income and 
expenditure in a way that is sustainable into the future. 
Like everyone here, Australia is committed to working constructively with all 
members to achieve the best outcomes for CCSBT.  
Australia’s delegation to the meeting is listed in the participants lists, but let me note 
we have participants from the department, from our fisheries regular (AFMA) and 
industry members.  
And finally, it would be remiss not to acknowledge that this is the last year Mr Brian 
Jeffriess will attend these meetings. Brian has been associated with the SBT fishery 
since the 1990s and has attended every CCSBT meeting since the Commission was 
established. Brian has a wealth of knowledge about the fishery and the Commission 
and will be greatly missed by the Australian delegation and all of the CCSBT. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Honorable Chairperson, Distinguished Delegates, Observers, Ladies, and Gentlemen, 
It is my pleasure to join you at the 30th Annual Meeting of the Commission, which is 
the first physical meeting after the Covid-19 pandemic. On behalf of Taiwan 
delegation, I would first like to commend Executive Secretary, Mr. Dominic 
Vallières, and his team for their excellent performance over the past year. 
I would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to Republic of Korea for their 
huge supports of organizing this important event as well as their warm hospitality to 
my delegation. In addition, I wish to thank the interpreters for their contributions in 
facilitating this meeting. It is indeed a huge help. 
The works for the annual meeting this year will be focused on such important issues 
as the annual TAC for 2024-2026, the budget for 2024, and the connections with other 
international organizations and non-Members. All are issues of critical importance 
that accord with not only a sustainable SBT fishery but also a steady and stable 
operation of this organization. I am convinced that with the firm supports of all 
Members, this Commission will continue to fulfill its mandate in the years to come. 
In this meeting, Members are going to decide the venue for the 31st meeting next 
year. Considering the transportation, safety, facilities, capacity, and convenience, I am 
confident that Taiwan remains the best venue for 2024 CCSBT meetings. I therefore 
wish to welcome you all next year in Taiwan. 
I am looking forward to fruitful discussions in the meeting of the following few days.  
Thank you!

Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Good morning to all. Indonesia first wishes to extend our appreciation to the 
Government of Korea for hosting this meeting and for the warm hospitality. This 
meeting is the first-ever offline meeting for the Commission meeting since the Covid-
19 pandemic. We are just as enthusiastic as you are to have the opportunity to 
reconvene with other delegates in this Extended Commission of the 30th Annual 
Meeting of the Commission. Ahead of us, we have a series of agendas to go through.  
In this opportunity, allow us to share with you our initial thoughts pertinent to some of 
the key agenda items. Recalling the recommendation of the Cape Town Procedure, we 
are supportive of the increase of global TAC for 2024-2026. Further to that, we view 
that we need an amendment to the SBT quota distribution, which is fairer and reflects 
the interest and concerns of developing coastal states. We believe that after more than 
20 years of CCSBT quota distribution in place, it is a perfect time to distribute them 
more equitably, which truly represents the dynamic and recent development of the 
fishing activities carried out by each member. 
All in all, Indonesia stands ready to discuss this important matter with other 
distinguished delegates. We believe that this meeting will be productive. We look 
forward to the discussion and hope that we can reach a consensus in the days to come. 
 
Attachment 5 – 4 
 
Opening Statement by Japan 
 
Honourable Chair, 
Executive Secretaries, Distinguished Delegates of All Members and Observers, 
First of all, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Republic of Korea for 
hosting this meeting here in Busan. I would also like to extend our thanks to the 
Executive Secretary, Mr. Dominic Vallières, and the staff of the CCSBT Secretariat 
for their tireless efforts in organising the first in-person annual meeting after four 
years, as well as to the interpreters who always do an excellent job. 
We recognise that this year is significant for CCSBT because of its task to conduct the 
stock assessment of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) and agree on the global Total 
Allowable Catch (TAC) for the next three-year block, 2024 – 2026.  
The 28th Extended Scientific Committee conducted the stock assessment and agreed 
that the stock has been rebuilding steadily toward the rebuilding target reference point 
of 30% of the original spawning stock biomass by 2035. It also concluded that no 
evidence exists for exceptional circumstances and that the TAC figure recommended 
last year, 20,647 tons, does not need to be modified. As CCSBT is the body that 
centers around the best available scientific evidence on SBT management, including 
the Management Procedure, and as the next TAC block will begin in a few months for 
some Members, this annual meeting is our last opportunity to agree on the TAC for 
the next TAC block. For that purpose, all Members should reaffirm the significance 
and necessity to discuss this agenda item cooperatively at this annual meeting. 
Another topic we focus on at this year's meeting is fulfilling our obligations as 
CCSBT Members and ensuring compliance with CCSBT rules and conservation and 
management measures. Fulfilling our obligations as CCSBT members is a prerequisite 
for exercising our rights as CCSBT members, including the opportunity to catch SBT. 
While it is necessary to consider unpredictable situations such as COVID-19, we are 
prepared to make every effort with any Member who has difficulty in carrying out its 
obligations to help address such difficulty. 
We hope to have a constructive discussion among all participants during this four-day 
meeting and make a significant step forward for better management of SBT. 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by South Africa 
 
Honourable Chairperson, Distinguished Delegates, Observers, Ladies, and 
Gentlemen, the South African delegation is elated to once again be party to this 30th 
physical Meeting of the CCSBT Commission after such a very long time of virtual 
interaction. Our gratitude and compliments are extended to Republic of Korea for 
hosting us in this beautiful town of Busan. To the Executive Secretary, and the 
Secretariat staff, thanks for your excellent administration and arrangements leading to 
this meeting. 
South African government continues to maintain and strive to enhance the 
management of its marine resource, including the management of all the tuna 
resources found both within and outside of our Exclusive Economic Zone. We 
understand the impact of managing these resources withing the broader ecological 
context, their interaction, and the impact of human activities on them. As custodians 
of these resources on behalf of our national and global citizen, it is for these reason 
that we continue to participate in various national and international forums that shapes 
and influence strategies so as legislation governing their sustainable management 
continues to remain relevant.  
Chairperson, this commitment, it is made against the backdrop of many other 
commitments we have made as a country both at national level and internationally. In 
delivering on these commitments we have made of sustainable management of marine 
resources,  we have to balance these against other competing socio-economic needs to 
promote justifiable economic and social development in South Africa to reduce 
poverty, inequality, and unemployment, especially for our rural communities. 
Since the 29th Meeting of the Extended Commission (EC), there has been attrition in 
capacity of staff responsible for tuna and tuna like species within various units in the 
South African Fisheries Management Branch, and this continues to remain a growing 
concern. The reduction thereof, has impacted negatively with regards to the 
management not only of the tuna and tuna like species. Although, there are processes 
underway to address the reduction in that capacity and in addition, we do appreciate 
the Secretariat’s continuous support, as well as the relevant CCSBT members and 
observers understanding and their willingness to assist moving forward. 
We are mindful of eminent and intense negotiations relating to distribution and 
allocation of catch over the coming few days and we believe that criterion that hinges 
on human and financial resources such as inability to participate in meetings and 
Working Groups will be prejudicial to developing member states that have limited 
resources, further plummeting them into recession and consequently affecting 
development and livelihoods. Although our capacity may be limited at the current 
moment, we are doing whatever we can to contribute to all efforts that are aimed at 
the furtherance of sustainable development and the protection of the marine 
environment. 
Lastly Chairperson, I trust that South Africa, together with the committed support 
from the Secretariat and relevant members and Observers of the CCSBT will address 
all of the critical and outstanding matters, including any other new matters that might 
arise during this 30th Meeting of the Extended Commission.  
On behalf of the Republic of South Africa, I would like to wish everyone a very 
fruitful and productive meeting and an enjoyable stay in Busan. Thank you, Enkosi, 
Ndza khensa.

Opening Statement by  
the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) 
 
ACAP is pleased to be able to participate in the in-person meetings of the Compliance 
Committee and Extended Commission. We thank the CCSBT Secretariat and the host 
country for the invitation and congratulate them on the smooth arrangements for these 
meetings.  
We were pleased to renew in December 2021 Memorandum of Understanding with 
the CCSBT, originally signed in 2015. We look forward to ongoing collaboration with 
the CCSBT in efforts minimise seabird bycatch and to tackle the ongoing 
conservation crisis faced by albatrosses and petrels. 
Through its 13 Parties, the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels 
(ACAP https://acap.aq) strives to conserve albatrosses and petrels by coordinating 
international activities to mitigate threats to their populations. Bycatch in pelagic 
longline fisheries is one of the greatest threats to seabirds, particularly albatrosses and 
petrels. We see this as a joint endeavour for ACAP, RFMOs and others. Fortunately, 
the crisis is not insoluble. Within jurisdictions where implementation of effective 
mitigation measures and appropriate enforcement has occurred, reductions in seabird 
bycatch have been demonstrated, sometimes dramatically so and without perceived 
detrimental consequences arising.  
Documents and reports submitted to the CCSBT Compliance Committee and 
Extended Commission illustrate that, while there have been some improvements, 
bycatch of seabirds remains a critical issue in CCSBT fisheries. We also note that 
some members have not been able to provide the full information required, resulting 
in some cases from a lack of the the required level of observer coverage. We also 
recall that the performance review of the CCSBT (discussed at EC29) included some 
concerns about seabird bycatch mitigation. 
In efforts to reduce seabird bycatch, compliance is key, and capacity building on 
enhancing compliance is vital. In this context ACAP is pleased to be a partner in the 
project coordinated by the CCSBT under the FAO’s Common Oceans Tuna project, 
aimed at enhancing awareness on and implementation of seabird measures in CCSBT 
fisheries. ACAP will be happy to contribute its expertise to the training and other 
activities planned under this project. Our updated best practice advice, guidelines, 
mitigation fact sheets and other resources are available, with some of them translated 
into Indonesian. ACAP’s guidelines for observers and for electronic monitoring, 
adopted in 2021, should be particularly useful for the project, as will our updated 
seabird identification guide, which is almost completed.  
ACAP continues to investigate best practice mitigation measures and to provide 
updated advice and guidance. The most recent meetings of ACAP’s Seabird Bycatch 
Working Group (SBWG11) and Advisory Committee (AC13), held in May this year, 
reviewed and endorsed ACAP’s current best practice advice. Following this review, 
ACAP continues to recommend that the most effective way to reduce seabird bycatch 
in pelagic longline fisheries is to use the following three best practice measures 
simultaneously: (1) branch line weighting, (2) night setting and (3) bird scaring lines, 
or use of one of the assessed hook-shielding and underwater bait setting devices. The 
simultaneous use of the three ACAP recommended mitigation measures optimises 
seabird bycatch reduction in longline fisheries. All three recommended measures are 
demonstrated to be effective; however, each has limitations when used alone. There is 
a period of time when hooks are accessible to birds even when branch lines are 
weighted. Night setting used alone is less effective at reducing seabird bycatch for 
nocturnally active birds and during bright moon light conditions. Bird scaring lines 
used alone can rarely protect baited hooks beyond the aerial extent of the line. 
Consequently, the simultaneous use of the three ACAP recommended seabird bycatch 
mitigation measures compensates for these limitations. 
SBWG11 reviewed new research relevant to lasers as mitigation measure, specifically 
research to determine if lasers cause eye injury in birds. Available evidence shows 
that high-energy lasers are ineffective at deterring seabirds from danger areas around 
fishing vessels and likely damage seabird visual systems with negative effects on 
foraging behaviour of laser exposed seabirds. The use of high-energy laser 
technologies for seabird bycatch mitigation is strongly discouraged by ACAP, since 
there is currently no evidence of effectiveness, and serious concerns remain regarding 
the potential impacts on the health of individual birds. 
The full 2023 ACAP review of mitigation measures and best practice advice for 
pelagic longline fisheries, is available on the ACAP website 
(https://www.acap.aq/resources/bycatch-mitigation/mitigation-advice/4548-acap-
2023-pelagic-longlines-mitigation-review-and-bpa/file). 
We look forward to presenting our updated advice to the ERSWG meeting next year 
and discussing them in more detail on that occasion, as well as making input as 
appropriate to assisting implementation of the Multi Year Seabird Strategy.

Opening Statement by BirdLife International 
 
BirdLife International thanks the CCSBT for continuing progress to improve fisheries 
management for Southern Bluefin Tuna and for the opportunity to participate in this 
work. We thank the Secretariat for the meeting arrangements, and our hosts, South 
Korea for their generous hospitality in hosting the Commission meetings this year. 
We are reminded of the importance of in person meetings for making meaningful 
progress on important Commission issues.  
BirdLife International reminds CCSBT Members that the conservation crisis for 
albatrosses and petrels is ongoing, and we note that seabird mortality caused by SBT 
fleets is a long-standing issue for the Commission. Indeed, seabird bycatch was the 
main failing identified in the 2007 Performance Review, and again in the 2021 
Performance Review. It’s important to note that the CCSBT fishing area has the 
greatest overlap with seabird distribution of any of the tuna RFMOs. 
BirdLife International thanks CCSBT Members for discussions on the issue of seabird 
bycatch in the Compliance Committee and the commitment to improve performance 
of their fleets in this area, including considering increasing observer coverage and the 
review rate of electronic monitoring. This is critical as we note that the Annual Report 
on the Performance of Members on ERS made it clear that the data being provided to 
the Commission is inadequate for measuring compliance to the implementation of 
seabird mitigation measures, the impacts of COVID-19 notwithstanding.  
BirdLife International contributed Information Paper CC18-02 to the Compliance 
Committee, which provides evidence of the importance of independent verification to 
assess the impact of CCSBT fisheries to ecologically related species, particularly 
seabirds. Key findings of the research that assesses the implementation of night-
setting compliance in tuna fisheries include:  
• Limited reporting of onboard observer data to RFMOs was identified. 
• Discrepancies between reported and actual night setting were observed. 
• Longline setting occurs most often over dawn when albatrosses are actively 
feeding, putting them at greater risk of being bycaught on hooks. 
• The study methods can be used by fisheries managers to better understand 
longline fleet activity and the implementation of conservation management 
measures. 
This research demonstrates that increased and improved observer coverage 
(human/electronic) in longline fleets is required to understand the impact of CCSBT 
fisheries to seabirds and compliance with Conservation and Management Measures 
that Members are obliged to implement.  
BirdLife is committed to collaborative efforts to improve the implementation of 
seabird bycatch mitigation measures in all tuna fisheries. We look forward to working 
with Members and the Secretariat to improve the performance on seabird mitigation 
measures through the Seabird Project, coordinated by Dr Ross Wanless.

Opening Statement by Humane Society International 
 
HSI appreciates the opportunity to again participate as an observer to the Extended 
Commission’s annual meetings. 
Regrettably most issues raised in our address to the 29th Annual Meeting are still of 
concern today, particularly with respect to ERS and how impacts of the SBT fishery 
can be better mitigated. With SBT continuing on a welcome pathway to abundance 
increase, it is even more important that seabird bycatch mitigation is not neglected, 
and this is supported by CCSBT Performance Review. 
In the previous two Commission meetings, we expressed our concern at the 
unaccounted increase in bycatch of seabirds resulting from greater fishing effort due 
to TAC increases. Based on current bycatch rates, the CCSBT TAC increases will 
cause an estimated 1,900 more lethal seabird interactions annually and deepen the 
conservation crisis which ACAP faces. Should Members agree to the proposed TAC 
increases, by 2029 the SBT longline sector will be responsible for killing 
approximately 20,900 birds annually. This number will have doubled in 6 years and 
would continue to increase under maintained circumstances of SBT stock recovery 
and commensurate TAC increase. Despite mitigation efforts, Member CC18 ERS 
Reports indicate high rates of bird interactions and we are apprehensive about 
adequate improvements being delivered by the Seabird Strategy in time to 
appropriately mitigate impacts. Allowing SBT vessels to continue following the 
CMM requirements of other tRFMOs will likely undermine the Strategy. HSI urge 
CCSBT to consider what measures will be required to mitigate increased impacts on 
seabirds with a TAC increase. Without these measures, pausing the TAC increase is 
the only option to avoid significantly increased seabird impacts until the Seabird 
Strategy (and its mitigation benefits) has been implemented.  
Recently, CCSBT Strategic Plan and SFMWG06 recognised the necessity of 
processes to account for the ecological implications of TAC increases, having stated 
‘the need for greater clarity in relation to the management of SBT vision and its 
application to ERS’ along with ‘moving toward more modern fisheries management 
concepts in the CCSBT Convention’. With unavoidable increased impacts on 
bycaught species due to TAC increases, we encourage and echo the need for this 
progress. 
HSI wishes Members a highly productive return to the advantages of again being 
together in meeting rooms and thanks Korea for hosting pleasantries of Haeundae 
seaside.

REGULATION 8 
 
SOCIAL SECURITY 
 
8.1 
It is a condition of employment that each staff member will contribute to a

insurance cover to the satisfaction of the Executive Secretary. Such insurance cover 
shall include adequate provision for dependants. The Commission shall pay two-thirds 
of the total contribution to the retirement fund and of the insurance premiums, up to 
the maximum percentage applying in the United Nations Secretariat from time to time 
of the total of the staff member's salary and salary related allowances. Such payment 
shall be by way of reimbursement upon the production of receipts, or shall be paid 
direct together with the employee's contribution. 
 
Personal leave applies to full-time and part-time employees (on a pro rata basis) but 
does not apply to casual employees, unless where expressly stated.  
 
Personal leave may be used for the purposes of carer’s leave subject to the person 
being a member of the staff member’s immediate family.  
 
Paid personal leave is available to a staff member, other than a casual employee, when 
they are absent:  
(i) 
due to personal illness or injury; or  
(ii) 
for the purposes of caring for an immediate family who is sick and 
requires the employee’s care and support or who requires care due to an 
unexpected emergency.

how long they have worked for the Commission and accrues as follows:  
 
(i) 
a full-time staff member is entitled to 20 days’ paid leave a year  
(ii) 
pro-rata entitlement applies to part-time staff members.  
 
A staff member’s entitlement to paid personal leave accrues progressively during a 
year of service according to the staff member’s ordinary hours of work and 
accumulates from year to year. 
 
8.2 
Staff members shall not be granted personal leave for a period of more than 3 
consecutive days and more than a total of 7 working days in any calendar year without 
producing a medical certificate.

second 6 months on half salary, except that no more than 4 months on full salary shall 
normally be granted in any period of 12 consecutive months. 
 
8.4 
After one year of employment in the Secretariat staff members shall be 
entitled to parental leave. On the basis of medical advice that the confinement will

from duty until eight weeks after confinement. During this period staff members shall 
receive full pay and corresponding allowances. 
 
8.5 
Staff members shall be entitled to bereavement leave upon the death of a 
family member or relative, up to a maximum of three days (not including travel days 
if required) in any calendar year. 
 
8.6 
In the event of death of a staff member following illness or surgery not 
resulting from an accident covered by the appropriate insurance, the right to salary, 
allowances and other corresponding benefits shall cease on the day on which death 
occurs, unless the deceased leaves dependants, in which case these shall be entitled to 
mortality allowances and return travel and removal expenses to country of origin or 
former residence at the expense of the Commission. 
 
8.7 
Eligibility of the dependants of a deceased staff member for the payment of 
return travel and removal expenses shall lapse if the travel is not undertaken within 
six months of the date of the staff member's death. 
 
8.8 
The above mortality allowance for death shall be calculated in accordance 
with the following scale: 
 
Years of Service 
 
 
 
 
Months of Net Base Pay Salary 
Following Death 
 
Less than 3 years

such lesser period as may be approved by the Executive Secretary or the Commission, 
as the case may require.

comply with the duties and obligations set out in these Regulations, or is incapacitated 
for service. 
 
10.4 
In the event of separation from service with the Secretariat, staff members 
shall be compensated at a rate of one month base pay for each year of service, 
beginning the second year, unless the cause of termination has been gross dereliction 
of duties imposed in Regulation 2. For a part year of continuous service, an employee 
will be paid a pro-rata part of one month’s base pay proportionate to that partial year 
of service. 
 
10.5 
On separation from service, a staff member shall, subject to Regulation 10.6

Attachment 8 
 
Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
CCSBT Members agreed that Mr Neil Hughes (Australia) chair the Finance and 
Administration Committee (FAC). The FAC was tasked with the following agenda:  
• Revision of the 2023 budget.  
• Drafting of the 2024 budget; and  
• Drafting of the indicative budgets for 2025 and 2026 
The FAC was also asked by the Extended Commission (EC) for advice on a proposal 
by the Secretariat to update the CCSBT Staff Regulations (paper CCSBT-
EC/2310/05). 
FAC also considered a proposal by the Executive Secretary to benchmark costs for 
annual CCSBT meetings with a view to seeking contributions for meeting costs above 
these costs from hosting Members. 
The FAC also considered proposed changes to the reporting of underspend as part of 
the year-end financial statements. 
The revised budget for 2023 
The Executive Secretary provided a summary of the 2023 revised budget prior to the 
meeting and FAC Members were asked to provide initial comments at that time. 
Details of the revised budget are also outlined in CCSBT-EC/2310/06. The revision 
incorporates actual income and expenditure together with forecast income and 
expenditure for the remainder of the year.  
Overall costs for 2023 are forecast to total $3,371,558, which is a 6% ($207,542) 
saving on the amount approved in 2023. This saving was the result of contributions by 
Japan and Korea towards meetings costs, improved returns on investment by the 
Secretariat, reduced travel costs, and reduced costs for the annual OMMP meeting. 
Members of the FAC thanked the Secretariat for the revised budget and endorsed it, 
and thanked Japan and Korea for their contributions to costs, the Secretariat for 
providing cost free translation services and for increased investment returns. 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission note and agree the revised 
budget for 2023 at Annex A. 
CCSBT Staff Regulations 
The Executive Secretary presented proposed changes to the CCSBT Staff 
Regulations, noting they had not been revised in over 20 years and the need to 
modernise these regulations, consistent with Australian standards. The Executive 
Secretary noted these changes had been informed in part by recent changes to the 
CCAMLR staff regulations, noting the CCAMLR Secretariat is also Australia based. 
The FAC recommends the EC agree to the proposed changes with an additional 
change to regulation 8.5, which relates to bereavement leave. The FAC recommends 
that international travel time be provided in addition to the proposed bereavement 
leave. 
The FAC also noted and agreed changes to Regulation 12 that would require the 
Executive Secretary to consult the CCSBT FAC Chair on any doubts arising from the 
application of the Regulations and this would occur in cases where no CCSBT Chair 
was in place. 
Proposed cost sharing arrangements for meeting costs. 
The Executive Secretary provided an overview of a Secretariat proposal to 
‘benchmark’ annual meetings costs, based on likely minimum meeting costs if 
meetings were to be held in Canberra. It was proposed that Members hosting meetings 
with higher costs be asked to cover these costs. 
FAC agreed that Members consider either providing funds for costs above the amount 
identified by the Secretariat or agree their turn to host a meeting be replaced by a 
meeting in Canberra or other lower cost location.  
However, the FAC recommends that the current approach which allows final 
decisions regarding cost sharing and location of annual meetings to be made by the 
EC, subject to advice from the FAC. 
Draft budget for 2024 
The FAC considered the proposed budgets outlined in CCSBT-EC/2310/07, which 
includes funding for the CCSBT’s usual business.  
In the Executive Secretary paper on the draft 2024 budget, it was noted that current 
contribution levels are not sufficient to cover the annual running costs of the CCSBT. 
The draft budget for 2024, presented in paper CCSBT-EC/2310/07, noted that it 
would result in a 32% increase in Total Expenditure from the previous year and that 
this level of increase cannot be sustained without a matching increase in contributions. 
The Executive Secretary therefore proposed a number of potential changes to reduce 
costs. 
 
The FAC recommends the proposed Technical Compliance Working group (TCWG) 
for 2024 be merged with the meeting of the Compliance Committee as a cost saving 
with an online process, initiated by the Secretariat, to complete the Compliance Risk 
Plan and to further categorise non-compliance in terms of the Corrective Actions 
Policy.  
The FAC noted to save costs the length of Compliance Committee meeting might not 
be changed, but daily meeting times extended to allow more time to include TCWG 
actions. 
The FAC also considered the Secretariat’s proposal to consolidate current part-time 
positions, at additional cost. The FAC recommends this not proceed at this time 
and noted additional support to the Secretariat might be available if Korea’s staff 
secondment proposal proceeds. 
The FAC considered options to top up the meeting participation fund, noting that it 
had been agreed the fund be financed by voluntary contributions or such other sources 
the Commission may identify. The FAC noted that the approximately $17,000 
remaining in the fund may be sufficient for meeting attendance considering the 
number of science-related meetings in 2024. The FAC Chair invited Members to 
further consider their capacity to voluntarily contribute to the fund. 
FAC noted the earlier EC decision to reduce the length of EC meetings, and factored 
savings associated with this decision into the 2024 budget. 
The FAC noted the 2024 budget carries a 5% increase in Member contributions. 
The FAC recommends the Extended Commission approve a 2024 budget totalling 
approximately $$4,283,400 as set out in Annex B, noting this will require 
approximately $640,000 from the Contribution Stabilisation Fund (CSF) to balance 
income and expenses. 
Indicative budgets for 2025 and 2026 
The FAC was also asked to consider indicative budgets for the two years beyond the 
upcoming budget. 
Most expenses within the indicative budgets represent ongoing commitments and did 
not require significant change from the FAC.  
The FAC noted with concern that both the 2025 and 2026 budgets require a 
drawdown of Secretariat savings, with the CSF completely drawn down by 2025. 
The FAC wishes to highlight that under all the funding scenarios considered, an 
annual increase of Member contributions of around 5% will be required from 2025 
onwards unless further reductions in expenses are achieved.  
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission note the indicative 2025 and 
2026 budgets as set out in Annex B. 
Other matters 
The FAC considered appropriate a proposal by the Secretariat to improve 
transparency of financial accounting and to better align with existing requirements 
under the Financial Regulations by making an additional statement to Members as 
part of Year End Financial Statements to advise on the CCSBT’s net cash position 
and whether the potential exists to make a contribution to the CSF. The FAC 
recommends the Extended Commission agrees this change be adopted.

1. Introduction 
A strategic plan for the Commission for the Conservation of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna 
This strategic plan outlines a common vision for how Members of the Commission for 
the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) would like to see the 
Commission operate in the future.  
 
Components of that vision include the state of the southern bluefin tuna (SBT) stock; 
how the CCSBT operates to effectively manage the stock; and how Members are 
implementing their obligations and benefiting from the management of the stock.  
 
This plan outlines not only a desired future state but also specific strategies and tasks 
associated with achieving the desired future state. This is the third Strategic Plan 
written for the CCSBT and builds on the 2009 and 2015 plans. 
The 2021 CCSBT Performance Review 
The 2015 Strategic Plan noted the CCSBT agreed to undertake periodic performance 
reviews of the CCSBT to assesses opportunities for improvement.  
 
A performance review was conducted in 2021 (the 2021 Review) and this provided 
suggestions for ongoing performance improvement. This strategic plan allows these 
actions to be incorporated into future work plans as well as confirming ongoing 
priority work for the Commission. In drafting this plan, suggested actions have been 
prioritised so that the overall work plan is achievable.  
Key challenges 
The 2021 CCSBT Performance Review concluded that the CCSBT’s performance 
status had remained challenging in certain areas, specifically: 
• 
Status of non-target species1; 
• 
Relationship to non-cooperating non-members; and 
• 
Special requirements of developing States.   
 
Taking into account the wide range of recommendations made by performance reviews 
of the CCSBT to date, key challenges for the CCSBT include: 
• 
Providing for the rebuild of the stock to a level that can sustain maximum 
sustainable yields (stock re-building); 
• 
Balancing the competing demands of those who harvest SBT against the 
biological demands of stock rebuilding (TAC setting and allocation);   
• 
Ensuring all SBT mortalities are attributed against Total Available Catch limits, 
and Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) catches are prevented (compliance);  
 
1 Species that belong to the same ecosystems as, or are associated with or dependent upon, the major 
target stocks. (paragraph 18 of the report of the 2021 CCSBT Performance Review)  
 
 
2 
 
 
• 
Ensuring that all States with an interest in SBT fisheries are cooperating with 
the Commission; 
• 
Ensuring CCSBT’s systems and processes allow for the rights and 
responsibilities of all Members and encourage cooperation from non-members 
(governance);  
• 
Considering the special requirements and capacity building needs of 
developing State Members and potential Cooperating Non-Members in terms 
of compliance with CCSBT obligations; and 
• 
Addressing the impact of SBT fisheries on non-target species that belong to the 
same ecosystem, in particular seabirds. 
 
2. Background 
The Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
Origins 
Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) were heavily fished in the past, with annual catches 
reaching 80,000 tonnes in the early 1960s. Heavy fishing resulted in a significant 
decline in the numbers of mature fish, and the annual catch began to fall rapidly.  
In the mid-1980s it became apparent that a way of limiting catches was needed. To 
enable the SBT stocks to rebuild, the main nations fishing SBT at the time – Australia, 
Japan, and New Zealand – began to apply strict quotas to their fishing fleets from 
1985. 
On 20 May 1994, the voluntary management arrangement between Australia, Japan 
and New Zealand was formalised when the Convention for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna, which the three countries signed in May 1993, came into force. 
The role of the CCSBT 
The objective of the Convention is to ensure, through appropriate management, the 
conservation and optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna. Decisions of the 
Commission and the Extended Commission are taken by a unanimous vote of the 
Members, consistent with the Rules of Procedure and relevant Resolutions of the 
CCSBT.  
 
The Convention created the Commission for the Conservation of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) and describes how it operates and functions. The 
functions of the CCSBT include— 
• collecting data and information, 
• deciding on a total allowable catch (TAC) for SBT and its allocation to 
Members,  
• deciding on additional measures including monitoring, control, and 
surveillance (MCS) measures considered necessary to achieve effective 
implementation of the Convention, 
• agreeing an annual budget, and 
• encouraging accession by other states. 
 
3 
 
 
Initially, the Commission adopted a relatively devolved mode of operation, with most 
core functions (such as provision of science and monitoring, control, and surveillance 
services) being done directly by Members, sometimes in line with standards 
established by the Commission. This approach has shifted in recent times with much of 
the scientific work now procured, funded, and managed by the Secretariat on behalf of 
Members. 
Membership of the Commission 
Membership of the CCSBT Commission is only open to Nation States. To facilitate 
the participation of fishing entities, the CCSBT established by resolution the Extended 
Commission (EC) and the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) in 2001 and revised 
the Resolution in 2013 to allow Regional Economic Integration Organisations (REIOs) 
to join the EC.  
Membership of the EC and the ESC includes all parties to the Convention, fishing 
entities, and REIOs.  
The EC and the ESC perform the same functions as the CCSBT and the SC 
respectively. Each Member has equal voting rights. Decisions of the EC that are 
reported to the CCSBT become decisions of the CCSBT unless the CCSBT agrees 
otherwise (but this has not happened since the EC resolution was agreed). Any 
decision of the Commission that affects the operation of the EC or the rights, 
obligations, or status of any individual Member within the EC should not be taken 
without prior due deliberation of that issue by the EC. 
Currently the EC consists of eight Members. There are currently no CCSBT 
Cooperating Non-Members: 
Members 
• Australia joined in 1994 
• Japan joined in 1994 
• New Zealand joined in 1994 
• Republic of Korea joined in 2001 
• Fishing entity of Taiwan joined in 2002 (Member of the EC only) 
• Indonesia joined in 2008 
• European Union joined in 2015 (Member of the EC only) 
• South Africa joined in 2016 
The CCSBT meets annually and has five subsidiary bodies which provide 
advice on their areas of expertise, either annually or as required— 
• the Scientific Committee (SC)/Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) 
(along with other technical working groups that may be required to 
complete its work, such as the Operating Model and Management 
Procedure (OMMP) Technical Meeting), 
• Finance and Administration Committee (FAC). 
• Compliance Committee (CC) and technical working groups, 
• Ecologically Related Species Working Group (ERSWG), and  
• the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group (SFMWG), 
A panel of independent scientists attend ESC meetings and provides advice 
directly to the CCSBT as required on scientific issues relating to the stock.

The southern bluefin tuna fishery 
Characterisation of the fishery 
The primary market for SBT is the Japanese Sashimi market, where premium prices 
can be obtained. 
The main methods used for catching SBT are longline fishing and purse seining. 
Longlining involves using long lengths of fishing line with many hooks. SBT are 
usually frozen at very low temperatures (-60C) and either unloaded at intermediate 
ports and shipped to markets in Japan or unloaded directly at markets in Japan. 
Purse seining involves using purse seine nets to enclose schools of SBT. This method 
is currently only used in the Australian SBT fishery. The enclosed schools of fish are 
towed to waters near the Australian mainland to floating cages anchored to the ocean 
floor. The tuna are fattened for several months and sold direct to export markets as 
frozen or chilled fish. 
Status of the stock 
As noted above, the SBT stock was historically subject to high levels of fishing 
pressure and remains in a depleted state. CCSBT has adopted a Management 
Procedure (MP) – a pre-agreed set of rules that specify changes to the TAC based on 
updated monitoring data – with the aim of rebuilding the stock based on scientific 
guidance on TAC setting.  
The CCSBT adopted an MP, known as the ‘Bali Procedure’, in 2011 to guide the 
setting of the global SBT TAC for the fishing years from 2012 and onwards. It 
presided over the rebuilding of the stock from approximately 5% of the original 
spawning biomass in 2010 to approximately 20% in 2020, which was the CCSBT’s 
interim rebuilding target.  
In 2019, the CCSBT developed a new MP, known as ‘Cape Town Procedure’ which 
incorporates new data series and a new rebuilding objective to guide the setting of 
TACs for 2021 and onwards. The Cape Town Procedure is tuned to a 50% probability 
of achieving a biomass level of 30% of the original spawning stock biomass (SSB) by 
2035, which is the current CCSBT’s rebuilding target. 
Since 2017, CCSBT has measured reproductive capacity as Total Reproductive Output 
(TRO) rather than Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB). The 2020 stock assessment 
indicated that the SBT TRO is at 20% of its initial biomass as well as below the level 
that could produce maximum sustainable yield. In 2022, the stock status through 
reconditioning and future projections using the Cape Town Procedure suggested the 
stock is continuing to rebuild, and in 2021 the SBT TRO was at 22% of its initial 
biomass, still below the level that could produce maximum sustainable yield. 
 
3. Objective, vision and goals  
This strategic plan sets out the objective of the Commission (consistent with the 
Convention text). The plan also establishes a common vision for how Members would 
like to see the Commission operate in the future. Components of that vision include the 
state of the southern bluefin tuna stock; how the Commission operates to effectively 
manage the stock; and how Members are implementing their obligations and 
benefiting from their successful management of the stock. Each of these components is 
associated with specific goals – the desired future state of the Commission – and 
strategies – the suggested approach to achieving the desired future state.

Convention objective 
The objective of the Convention is to ensure, through appropriate management, the 
conservation and optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna. 
 
Vision and goals 
Management of SBT 
The Commission agrees the SBT tuna stock is to be managed at a biomass level that 
supports the maximum sustainable yield, and the risks related to fishing for SBT and 
impacts from fishing for SBT on ecologically related species are mitigated.  
• This includes strategies concerning stock rebuilding, allocation and 
ecologically related species.  
• This also includes consideration and review of all other risks including, 
but not limited to, marine pollution and human safety. 
 
Operation/Administration of the Commission and Secretariat 
It was agreed the Commission should operate effectively and efficiently, to responsibly 
manage fishing for SBT. 
• This includes strategies for effective and efficient operation of 
Commission, its subsidiary bodies and Secretariat, including 
harmonisation with other RFMOs.  
 
Participation and implementation by Members, including Compliance. 
Members are actively participating in management of SBT through the Commission 
and implementing its decisions. 
• This includes strategies concerning MCS, sanctions and assistance to 
developing countries. 
 
4. 2021 CCSBT Performance Review  
The CCSBT Performance Review Panel included 75 priority recommendations for 
CCSBT’ consideration (Sinan et al., 2021). These recommendations were prioritised 
by the Panel through allocating a ranking of very high, high, medium, or low. The 
report of the 2021 Performance Review2 of the CCSBT was provided to CCSBT 
Members on 1 March 2022. 
The Performance Review evaluated the CCSBT based on 29 criteria and found that 
most of them were rated as satisfactory or better. However, the review also identified 
three specific criteria where the CCSBT's performance was rated as ‘bad’. These 
criteria were the status of major non-target species, the relationship with Non-
Cooperating Non-Members, and responding to the special requirements of developing 
States.  
The report was also provided to the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
(ERSWG), Compliance Committee (CC) and Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) 
for these subsidiary bodies to consider and provide advice on any recommendations to 
the EC relevant to those bodies.

The Commission considered Performance Review recommendations and 
recommendations from subsidiary bodies in reaching its decision of priority actions to 
include in the Strategic Plan for the next 5 year period, noting however that some of 
the recommendations from the Performance Review did not fall within the mandate of 
any subsidiary body but were assessed as part of the SFMWG review process. 
Members have agreed on an Action Plan, found at Attachment A, that is aimed at 
addressing those recommendations having been deemed of the highest priority. 
Members note that there are a range of activities that are critical to the performance of 
the Commission that were not identified as requiring new action or resources but are 
currently being undertaken as part of the strategic ongoing work of the Commission 
outlined in Attachment B. 
 
5. Annual Monitoring and Implementation 
To ensure that the objectives of the Strategic Plan are met, the CCSBT will undertake 
annual monitoring and reporting against the actions agreed under the plan. As was the 
case with the implementation of the previous Strategic Plan, the EC will hold ultimate 
accountability for monitoring of the Strategic Plan and this task will be considered as 
part of a standing agenda item for the annual meeting. The Secretariat will be 
responsible for compiling the information necessary for the EC to conduct its annual 
monitoring review. 
Subsidiary bodies holding responsibility for particular action items are expected to 
report back on the progress of those activities as part of their respective meeting 
reports. Subsidiary bodies will also need to reflect any priorities identified in the 
Strategic Plan that were not previously included in the appropriate planning documents 
(e.g. Compliance Action Plan). 
The Finance and Administration Committee will also take into consideration the 
priorities identified in the Strategic Plan as part of its budgetary deliberations during 
the EC.

Resolution on the Allocation of the Global Total Allowable Catch 
(updated at the Thirtieth Annual Meeting – 9-12 October 2023) 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
Seized by the need to ensure the conservation and optimum utilisation of southern 
bluefin tuna based on the best available scientific advice, 
Recalling agreement reached on nominal catch levels at the 16th annual meeting of the 
Extended Commission meeting and the Resolution on the Total Allowable Catch and 
Future Management of Southern Bluefin Tuna adopted at that meeting, 
Further to the Resolution on the Adoption of a Management Procedure adopted at the 
annual meeting of the Extended Commission in 2011, 
Noting that the Management Procedure is the basis for setting the total allowable catch 
since 2012, 
Taking into account the desirability of a transparent and stable process for allocating 
total allowable catch to Members and Cooperating Non-Members, which provides 
greater certainty to Members and Cooperating non-Members, in particular for their 
fishing industries, and facilitates the administration of national allocations, 
Recalling the Extended Commission agreed at its special meeting in 2011 to 
principles that would apply to the distribution of any increase in the global total 
allowable catch under the Management Procedure, 
Further recalling the changes to nominal catch proportions agreed in 2016, 
Further recalling that all Members had returned to their original nominal catch levels 
and exceeded those levels from 2018, 
Taking it into account that the performance review in 2021 recommended 
development of clear guidelines for allocation to new Members and Cooperating 
Non-Members, 
In accordance with paragraph 3(a) of Article 8 of the Convention for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, the Extended Commission decides as 
follows: 
 
1. The total allowable catch (TAC) set on the basis of the Management Procedure 
(MP)1 shall be allocated among Members and Cooperating Non-Members 
according to this Resolution. 
2. Unless this Resolution provides otherwise, the TAC shall be allocated among 
Members based on Members’ Allocation Percentage levels set out in the Annex 
of this Resolution. 
3. If there is no change to the TAC, each Member’s allocation will remain 
unchanged. 
 
1 The Management Procedure agreed to under the Resolution on the Adoption of a Management Procedure adopted 
at the annual meeting of the Extended Commission in 2011, and any subsequent revisions to that Resolution. 
 
4. If there is an increase to the TAC, the additional tonnage will be allocated 
amongst the Members based on the Allocation Percentage level as set out in the 
Annex to this Resolution. If there is a decrease to the TAC, each Member’s 
allocation will decrease consistent with its Allocation Percentage level. 
However, the European Union’s allocation will not decrease below 10 tonnes. 
The allocation for a Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) and/or a new Member 
specified in paragraphs 6 and 7 will decrease in accordance with a separate 
decision to be made by the EC. 
5. The Extended Commission may decide on an amount of the TAC to set aside for 
Research Mortality Allowance based on the advice provided by the Extended 
Scientific Committee. 
6. The Extended Commission may decide the allocation for a Cooperating Non-
Member (CNM) at the annual meeting where its status as a CNM is agreed in 
accordance with the Resolution to Establish the Status of Cooperating Non-
Member of the Extended Commission and the Extended Scientific Committee, 
taking into account such elements as its potential SBT fishing capacity, its 
monitoring, control, and surveillance capacity, its administrative mechanisms to 
implement its CCSBT obligations, its past record of SBT fishing and 
management, and its need for SBT catch.  The allocation is subject to the annual 
review of its status as a CNM, and a possible decrease in accordance with 
paragraph 4. 
7. The Extended Commission may decide the allocation for a New Member (a 
Member that is not included in the current Annex) at the first annual meeting 
after it becomes a Member in accordance with the Resolution to Establish an 
Extended Commission and an Extended Scientific Committee, taking into 
account such elements as its potential SBT fishing capacity, its monitoring, 
control and surveillance capacity,  its administrative mechanisms to implement 
its CCSBT obligations, its past records of SBT fishing and management, and its 
need for SBT catch. The allocation shall be no more than a maximum of 0.355% 
of the TAC of the year of the annual meeting during the first three fishing 
seasons unless the Extended Commission decides otherwise, including a 
possible decrease in accordance with paragraph 4. 
8. The total amounts decided in accordance with paragraph 5 to 7 shall be deducted 
from the global TAC before allocation of the remaining TAC among Members 
as specified in the Annex2. 
9. A new Member may be added to the Annex subject to a review of its compliance 
status with CCSBT measures at least after the three-year period provided in 
paragraph 7 and when the next first determination is made in relation to the 
allocation. The Allocation Percentage levels in the Annex may be revised as a 
result of adding a New Member. 
 
 
 
 
2  For the purposes of calculating budget contributions under paragraph 2(b) of Article 11 of the Convention, 
‘nominal catches’ shall be taken as the amount determined in accordance with paragraph 7 for New Members, 
and paragraph 8 for Members.

Resolution to Align CCSBT’s Ecologically Related Species measures 
with those of other tuna RFMOs 
(Updated at the Thirtieth Annual Meeting – 9-12 October 2023) 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Recalling the decision made at the 5th Strategy and Fisheries Management Working 
Group Meeting to develop a binding Ecological Related Species (ERS) measure for 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) Members 
without duplicating the effort of other tuna RFMOs by creating a CCSBT Resolution 
that requires CCSBT Members to follow the ERS measures of other relevant tuna 
RFMOs, 
 
Noting the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation 
and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the 
need to cooperate and ensure consistency between conservation and management 
measures in the different tuna regional fisheries management organisations, 
 
Concerned that some seabird species, notably some albatrosses and petrels, are 
threatened with global extinction, 
 
Mindful that fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna can also cause incidental harm to other 
species such as sea turtles, sharks and cetaceans, 
 
Further recalling the requirement in Article 5(2) of the Convention for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna that the Parties shall expeditiously provide to 
the CCSBT data on, inter alia, ecologically related species, 
 
Determined to mitigate incidental harm to ecologically related species caused by fishing 
for Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Noting the importance of harmonising conservation and management measures with 
other organisations responsible for managing international fisheries, as agreed at the 
Kobe Meeting of Joint Tuna RFMOs on 26 January 2007, 
 
Reaffirming the recommendation at the seventh meeting of the Ecologically Related 
Species Working Group (ERSWG) held in Tokyo from 3 to 6 July 2007, that Members 
and Cooperating Non-Members will provide national reports on their interactions with 
ecologically related species in Southern Bluefin Tuna fisheries to the ERSWG, 
Agrees in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8, that: 
 
1. For the purposes of this CCSBT Resolution: 
a) the ‘Area of Competence of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission’ is that 
described in Article 2 of the Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian 
Ocean Tuna Commission;  
 
b) the ‘Convention Area of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 
Commission’ is that described in Article 3 of the Convention on the 
Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western 
and Central Pacific Ocean;  
c) the ‘Convention Area of the International Commission for the Conservation of 
Atlantic Tunas’ is that described in Article 1 of the International Convention 
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas;  
d) An Area defined in paragraphs a) – c) above is an “Area of Competence” and 
are collectively the “Areas of Competence”;  
e) ‘ERS Measures’ mean all measures relating to ecologically related species in 
force in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), the Western and Central 
Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the International Commission for the 
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), as adopted and amended from time 
to time, as contained in Annex I; 
f) Member or Cooperating Non-Member means a Member or Cooperating Non-
Member of the Extended Commission of the CCSBT. 
 
2. This Resolution shall apply to all vessels on the ‘CCSBT Record of fishing vessels 
authorised to fish for Southern Bluefin Tuna’ in the Areas of Competence. Each 
Member and Cooperating Non-Member shall ensure that such vessels flying its flag 
and fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area of Competence comply with all 
ERS Measures in force in that Area of Competence (whether or not the Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member is a member of the tuna RFMO in which the ERS 
Measures were adopted). 
 
3. When fishing outside Areas of Competence, Members and Cooperating Non-
Members shall use Tori lines in all long-line SBT fisheries below 30 degrees south. 
 
4. Where Areas of Competence overlap, Members and Cooperating Non-Members 
shall elect which applicable RFMO’s ERS Measures to apply.  
 
5. Each Member and Cooperating Non-Member shall ensure that effective action is 
taken in response to a vessel flying its flag that fails to comply with the obligations 
contained in the ERS Measures when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area 
of Competence. If a Member or Cooperating Non-Member of the Extended 
Commission undertakes fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area of 
Competence of a Convention of which it is not a Member, that Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member shall report, if any, such actions relating to the relevant 
ERS Measures to the Compliance Committee of the CCSBT, unless the compliance 
of that Member or Cooperating Non-Member with such ERS measures is assessed 
in the appropriate body of that Convention.  
 
6. The CCSBT secretariat will annually update the list of ERS Measures contained in 
Annex I before the CCSBT Extended Commission Meeting according to any 
decisions taken on ecologically related species at the Annual Meetings of the IOTC, 
WCPFC, and ICCAT. 
 
7. Except in the case of WCPFC, Members and Cooperating Non-Members that have 
formally objected to an ERS Measure in the relevant tuna RFMO, and who, by 
reason of that formal objection and the operation of the tuna RFMO’s decision-
making rules, are not bound by that ERS Measure, are exempted from applying that 
ERS Measure when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in the applicable Area of 
Competence. In the case of WCPFC, Members and Cooperating Members that have 
sought a review of a decision on an ERS measure in accordance with Article 20, 
paragraph 6 of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly 
Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean are exempted from 
applying that ERS Measure when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in the 
applicable Area of Competence until the Measure becomes binding. 
 
8. The Secretariat shall annually present a report to the CCSBT Compliance 
Committee on the implementation of the ERS Measures, for the sole purpose of the 
provision of information for Members and Cooperating Non-Members.
