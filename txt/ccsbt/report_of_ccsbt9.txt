Report of the Extended Commission of the 
Ninth Annual Meeting of the Commission 
15 – 18 October 2002 
Canberra, Australia 
 
Agenda Item 1. 
 Opening of the Meeting 
Agenda Item 1.1. 
Election of Chair and Vice Chair for the First Meeting of 
the Extended Commission 
1. The Chair and Vice Chair of CCSBT9 (Mr Daryl Quinlivan, Australia and Mr Stan 
Crothers, New Zealand) were elected as the Chair and Vice Chair of the Extended 
Commission meeting. 
Agenda Item 1.2. 
Admission of the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
2. The Chair announced that the Fishing Entity of Taiwan’s membership to the 
Extended Commission became effective on 30 August 2002.  The Fishing Entity of 
Taiwan was formally welcomed to the Extended Commission. 
3. The Fishing Entity of Taiwan addressed the Extended Commission on its admission.  
Its statement is at Attachment 1. 
4. All members welcomed the admission of the Fishing Entity of Taiwan. 
Agenda Item 1.3. 
Adoption of agenda 
5. Japan requested an amendment to the order in which the Agenda items were 
considered, to accommodate the late arrival of the Head of the Japanese delegation. 
The Extended Commission agreed, but Australia and New Zealand noted that the 
meeting should provide as much time as possible to discuss important issues such as 
the TAC and the TIS. The Agenda was adopted and is included at Attachment 2. 
6. The list of meeting participants is included at Attachment 3. 
7. The list of documents tabled at the meeting is included at Attachment 4. 
Agenda Item 1.4. 
Opening statements 
Agenda Item 1.4.1. 
Members 
8. Opening statements by members of the Extended Commission are included at 
Attachment 5.  In their opening statements, members of the Extended Commission 
identified the priority issues for consideration at the meeting. 
 
 
 
  
 
2 
Agenda Item 1.4.2. 
Other states and entities 
9. South Africa and Indonesia gave opening statements. South Africa’s statement is at 
Attachment 6.   
Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
10. The report from the Secretariat was provided as paper CCSBT-EC/0210/04. 
11. Participants accepted the report.  No comments were made on the content of the 
report, but participants noted that many of the items mentioned in the report would 
require substantial discussion under the appropriate agenda items. 
Agenda Item 3. 
Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
3.1. 
Adoption of the revised 2002 budget 
12. Mr Brian Macdonald, the Executive Secretary of the CCSBT presented paper 
CCSBT-EC/0210/05, which proposed the revision of the 2002 budget. 
13. The Extended Commission agreed to the revised budget for 2002 incorporated in 
the report from the Finance and Administration Committee. The Finance and 
Administration Committee’s report is at Attachment 7. 
3.2. 
Adoption of the 2003 budget 
14. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/0210/06, a proposed budget 
for 2003. 
15. The Extended Commission endorsed the budget for 2003 incorporated in the report 
from the Finance and Administration Committee. The Finance and Administration 
Committee’s report is at Attachment 7. 
16. The Extended Commission agreed to the surface tagging program costs, but noted 
Japan’s domestic financial situation in securing the funds before December 2002. It 
was agreed however, that the program should commence as scheduled. 
17. There was no consensus on New Zealand’s and the Fishing Entity of Taiwan’s  
proposal for the cost of the tagging program to be divided among the members on 
the basis of catch allocations. The Extended Commission agreed that the funding 
formula for the general budget should be applied for 2003 and that a review should 
be undertaken to establish guidelines for the funding of future scientific activities of 
the Extended Commission before next year’s meeting. 
3.3. 
Other matters 
18. No other matters were discussed. 
 
 
  
 
3 
Agenda Item 4. 
Relationship with non-members 
19. A draft resolution was prepared to establish the status of a “cooperating non-
member” under the auspices of the Convention. It was agreed to settle this resolution 
out of session as soon as possible. 
4.1. 
Indonesia 
20. Indonesia advised that it wished to contribute to the conservation and management 
of SBT and to act against IUU fishing.  Indonesia advised that it would be willing to 
become a cooperating non-member to the CCSBT, and that it looked forward to 
becoming a full member at some stage in the future. 
21. Members of the Extended Commission noted the importance of the SBT spawning 
ground off Indonesia and stressed the need for Indonesia to cooperate with the 
Extended Commission.  Members of the Extended Commission also expressed their 
desire for Indonesia to progress towards full membership of the CCSBT as soon as 
possible. 
22. It was noted that before accepting Indonesia as a cooperating non-member, it is 
necessary for the Extended Commission to establish the status of a “cooperating 
non-member” and then request Indonesia to become a “cooperating non-member”.  
The Extended Commission would need to consider how to work with Indonesia to 
obtain appropriate scientific information, and catch and effort data for appropriate 
management of the spawning ground.   
4.2. 
South Africa 
23. South Africa summarised the principal points from its opening statement 
(Attachment 6) forming the basis of its application to accede to the Convention. 
24. The Extended Commission welcomed the Republic of South Africa’s interest in 
joining the Commission and acknowledged the desirability of the Republic of South 
Africa becoming a member in due course. However, the Extended Commission also 
noted that allocation of SBT would be another issue that needs to be discussed with 
South Africa. 
25. The Extended Commission was not able to agree at this time on the terms and 
conditions on the basis of which to respond to the Republic of South Africa’s 
application for membership. It noted that the resolution on cooperating non-
membership would provide a basis for future engagement between the Extended 
Commission and the Republic of South Africa, and that it would provide further 
information to the Republic of South Africa on this matter when the resolution takes 
effect. 
4.3. 
Others 
26. Japan presented a draft list of IUU vessels that it had identified from TIS data and 
other sources as CCSBT-EC/0210/23.  Japan sought the meeting agreement to a 
 
  
 
4 
resolution similar to that adopted by ICCAT for action against IUU vessels.  
ICCAT’s resolution was circulated as CCSBT-EC/0210/WP-2 and a draft resolution 
for CCSBT, prepared by Japan, was circulated as CCSBT-EC/0210/WP-4. Members 
agreed to work intersessionally on this. 
Agenda Item 5. 
Action Plan 
5.1. 
Report on identified nations 
27. The Extended Commission noted the role of the Action Plan in deterring fishing 
and fishing activities that undermines the conservation and management objectives 
of the  Extended Commission.  
28. Members of the Extended Commission considered taking further measures in 
relation to Belize, Honduras, Cambodia, and Equatorial Guinea in accordance with 
the Action Plan. Some concerns were expressed regarding the appropriateness of 
taking measures at this stage against these countries, including: issues of WTO 
consistency; consistency of approach to other countries than these four countries; 
possible difficulty of taking action when no national quotas have been agreed by 
CCSBT; whether or not lack of response to communication represented an 
unwillingness to cooperate; and the discontinuation of SBT exports to members of 
the Extended Commission as reflected in the TIS data. 
29. For these reasons, some Members of the Extended Commission were not prepared 
to implement trade restrictive measures at this stage, although Japan proposed to 
prepare a measure for the time when imports from these four nations re-commenced 
in the future. This issue will be further reviewed at CCSBT 10. However, it was 
agreed that Belize would be informed that it was being raised to the second level of 
the Action Plan to bring them up to the same status as Honduras, Cambodia and 
Equatorial Guinea. The Extended Commission’s resolution to give effect to this 
decision is at Attachment 8. 
30. As regards Indonesia, the Extended Commission noted that mechanisms were under 
consideration to strengthen the cooperation of Indonesia through establishment of 
the status of a cooperating non-member, although the cooperation of Indonesia in the 
future will be further reviewed. 
5.2. 
Others 
31. The Extended Commission considered information submitted by Japan on 
identified IUU fishing vessels which indicated some activity by vessels flagged by 
the Philippines and the Seychelles. Japan suggested that the Secretariat write to these 
two countries, identifying them in accordance with the Action Plan. It was noted that 
the Philippines had supplied country catch data and TIS data, and had notified the 
Secretariat that the vessels concerned would be de-registered shortly. The Seychelles 
had also supplied TIS data for two of the vessels concerned.  
 
  
 
5 
32. The meeting agreed that the Executive Secretary should write to the Philippines 
seeking confirmation that the two vessels notified to the Extended Commission 
would be de-registered as indicated. 
33. The meeting agreed to identify the Seychelles under paragraph 2 of the 2000 Action 
Plan and that the Executive Secretary would write to the Seychelles, seeking advice 
on their involvement in the SBT fishery. The letter would indicate that their 
response would be taken into account in considering potential action under the 
Action Plan. 
Agenda Item 6. 
Review of SBT fisheries 
34. Reports on the SBT fisheries of Members of the Extended Commission are included 
at Attachment 9. Consistent with the rules of the Extended Commission, members 
of the Extended Commission sought clarification on some specific issues arising 
from these reports. 
35. In response to questions, members of the Extended Commission and observers 
made the following points of clarification: 
• Australia advised that mortalities in purse seines and tow cages are factored into 
the catch data provided to the Commission. It also advised that comprehensive 
research of recreational fishing was underway with several State Governments. 
• The Fishing Entity of Taiwan indicated that its regulations do not permit small 
boats to operate in the spawning grounds and it has not issued any TIS document 
to small boats so far. 
• Japan explained the reasons for the excess of catch to its voluntary catch limit in 
the 2001 fishing season and indicated that it would take responsible actions for 
this by reducing its level of catch in the following fishing seasons by the 
exceeded amount (226 tonnes).  Japan is implementing corrective measures to 
cross-check its catches to overcome the problem that caused the over catch.  
• Korea explained that its catch of 735 tonnes, which was less than its national 
quota, was caused by some of its SBT vessels targeting other species in the 
Pacific Ocean for economic reasons. Since there are only 16 SBT vessels 
voluntarily regulated by domestic industries, a small number of vessels can 
impact on total catch level of SBT. Korea also reported that their 2001 figures 
were provided as processed weights, not whole weights. 
• In relation to the discrepancy in Table 3 of paper CCSBT-EC/0210/14 between 
Korea’s 2001 catch and 2001 Korean TIS export information, Korea indicated 
that this was being discussed with the Secretariat.  The Secretariat indicated that 
this related partially to reporting in processed weights and partially to timing 
issues between catching and export. 
 
  
 
6 
• New Zealand advised that it would reduce its 2003/04 catch to compensate for 
its 32 tonne over catch in the 2001/02 season. 
• Indonesia advised the Extended Commission that its regulations related to tuna 
generally and indicated that it has introduced a new registration system for 
fishing in its EEZ with three classifications: (1) Joint venture (Indonesian 
flagged); (2) Purchase on instalment (moving to Indonesian flag); (3) Licensed 
(Foreign flagged).  
36. Australia stated that Japan’s over catch must be paid back in 2003 in full. 
37. New Zealand suggested that in the future the Extended Commission might consider 
implementing a standardised catch reporting mechanism. 
Agenda Item 7. 
Review of CCSBT scientific process – independent chairs of 
SAG/SC and Advisory Panel 
38. Mr Andrew Penney, Independent Chair of the Scientific Committee provided 
comment on the value of the Advisory Panel to both the scientific process and 
scientific progress of the CCSBT.  He also noted that the CCSBT was at a critical 
stage in the development of management procedures and in developing suitable 
CPUE inputs for the management procedure and stock assessment process and that 
input from the Advisory Panel was important for this work.  This work is due for 
completion in March 2004. 
39. Mr Penney said that his view and the view of the Scientific Committee was that the 
term of the Advisory Panel should be extended and that the members of the current 
panel had the required knowledge and worked well with the members of the 
Extended Commission. 
40.  Members of the Extended Commission expressed their appreciation for the good 
work done by the Panel and agreed to reappoint the active members of the advisory 
panel (Dr Hilborn, Dr Parma, Dr Ianelli and Professor Pope) for another two years.  
This would coincide with the conclusion of the management procedure development 
work.  The term of the Advisory Panel would be reviewed in 2004, at CCSBT 11. 
41. The Secretariat responded to the Fishing Entity of Taiwan’s request for clarification 
on the process for re-election of the Independent Chairs of the Scientific Committee, 
and SAG by noting that there were no specific terms of appointment for the 
independent chairs. 
42. Members of the Extended Commission also agreed to re-elect the current 
Independent Chairs of the SAG (Dr Annala) and SC (Mr Penney).  
43. In extending the terms of the SAG chair and advisory panel, Korea expressed 
concern that the operation of the SAG was difficult to follow and that only a few 
participants could fully understand discussions.  This meant that other members of 
the Extended Commission could not contribute to the meeting. Korea emphasised 
 
  
 
7 
that the SAG meeting is for all members’ benefit, not just for the exchange of the 
relevant experts’ understanding on the issues. Korea made a strong proposal that the 
chairs of the SAG and SC improve the systems for operating the meetings including 
technical arrangements such as using power point projections in their presentation. 
44. The Chair proposed that at their next meeting, the SAG and the Extended Scientific 
Committee should consider how to better communicate with each other during its 
meetings. 
45. Japan pointed out the need for highly technical discussions and that the SAG and 
SC chairs often re-capped discussion so that participants could follow progress in 
the meetings. Japan was satisfied with the operation of the SAG and SC in recent 
years. 
Agenda Item 8. 
Report from the Scientific Committee 
46. The Chair of the Scientific Committee, Mr Penney provided a detailed account of 
the report of the Seventh meeting of the Scientific Committee, which is provided at 
Attachment 10.The record presented below, only incorporates items of major 
significance from his presentation and subsequent questions from members. 
 
8.1. 
Status of the SBT stock 
47. Mr Penney advised that based on an inter-sessional review of 7 fisheries indicators, 
the SAG had decided that there was no evidence of substantial changes in the SBT 
fishery between 2001 and 2002, and members had decided that there was no need to 
undertake a full model-based stock assessment in 2002. 
48. The Extended Scientific Committee had also decided that there was no reason to 
change the SBT stock status advice provided to the Commission in 2001. In 
particular, Mr Penney emphasised that the 2000 catch level of approximately 15,500 
tonnes appeared to be close to the current replacement yield, with a 50 percent 
chance that the stock could either decrease or increase at this harvest level. 
8.2. 
Scientific Research Program 
49. As a general observation, Mr Penney said that there had been very encouraging 
progress on all aspects of the Scientific Research Program. However, the surface 
tagging program had not achieved its target for tag deployment this year. 
8.2.1. 
Characterisation of SBT catch 
50. Mr Penney reported that the Extended Scientific Committee had considered a list of 
deficiencies identified in Members data collection systems and that 
recommendations had been made for improvements in a number of areas where 
feasible. 
 
 
  
 
8 
8.2.2 
CPUE interpretation and analysis 
51. Mr Penney reported on progress by the CPUE modelling group in developing an 
agreed set of CPUE indicators. He said that work of the group would continue and 
that by 2009 a single robust CPUE index should be agreed for use in the 
Management Procedure. 
52. The scientists were urged to adhere to the deadline for finalising work on the 
Management Procedure. 
8.2.3. 
Scientific observer program standards and review of 
member compliance 
53. Mr Penney outlined the process by which the draft observer standard had been 
developed.  He indicated that the Secretariat has circulated a revised draft of the 
standards incorporating the discussion at the Extended Scientific Committee. He 
noted that Members had been asked to provide comments on this draft by the end of 
November 2002. 
8.2.4. 
SBT tagging program 
54. Mr Penney explained that the primary objective of the tagging program was to tag 
large numbers of juvenile fish to estimate fishing mortality rates.  He noted that the 
targets for the surface fishery tagging program had not been achieved for a number 
of reasons and outlined the options for addressing this problem. 
55. Mr Penney said that tag recovery systems had been put in place by members of the 
Extended Commission and the Secretariat.  It is important that these tag recovery 
processes be supported by regular communication between the Secretariat, members 
of the Extended Commission and non-members involved in the fishery. In 
particular, it is crucial that members maintain effective communication with their 
vessels to ensure the reporting of tagged fish that are captured. 
56. Mr Penney explained that data on tag reporting rates were essential in allowing an 
estimate of the precision of fishing mortality to be made. 
57. It was stressed that the accuracy of tag reporting rate estimates was closely related 
to the relationship between number of fish tagged, and the level of observer 
coverage. New Zealand noted that consideration needed to be given to increasing 
either the tagging rates or observer coverage, to ensure the effectiveness of the 
program. 
8.2.5. 
Direct ageing manual 
58. Mr Penney advised of the success of the Direct Age Estimation Workshop held in 
June 2002.  He noted that at the end of the workshop, all members of the Extended 
Commission were able to make consistent age estimates, and that a final draft of the 
ageing manual had been completed and is expected to be agreed shortly. 
 
  
 
9 
8.2.6. 
Other SRP components 
59. It was advised that members of the Extended Commission were making progress on 
other SRP components including: the recruitment monitoring program, the 
development of a spawning biomass index; and fisheries oceanography for the 
improvement of habitat definition. 
8.3. 
Management procedure 
60. Mr Penney advised that work on the Management Procedure was going very well, is 
on schedule and is due for completion in March 2004. The work being done is very 
sophisticated and is at the highest level internationally. Mr Penney said the 
contribution of the external panel, and the consultant, Vivian Haist had been 
extremely valuable. 
61. Members supported the work on the management procedure and indicated their 
strong desire that the timetable be adhered to. 
62. It was also observed that Industry participation was crucial to development of 
suitable management procedures.  The meeting agreed that in addition to members 
consulting with their own industry members, industry participation should occur at 
both the second and third management procedure workshops and other related 
meetings. 
63. Australia noted the need for the management strategy to reflect the reality of the 
structure of current members fishing industries for SBT. 
8.4. 
Indonesian Catch Monitoring 
64. It was agreed that the proposed workshop to review catch monitoring processes in 
Indonesia should proceed.  
65. Australia supported the review of the Indonesian catch monitoring system, but 
stated their view that if there was to be a review of this, then there must also be a full 
review of the TIS. Australia believed that the TIS was inaccurate and that it was 
providing a misleading view of catches. Australia wanted the TIS to become a catch 
documentation system and also wanted landing data for all Japanese catches to be 
provided to the TIS. 
66. Japan expressed its view that the review should be concentrated on the examination 
of the current methods of estimation of Indonesian SBT catch. 
67. The Extended Commission agreed to a terms of reference for the Indonesian catch 
monitoring system.  The agreed terms of reference are at Attachment11. 
68. The meeting agreed that the Chair of the Scientific Committee should Chair the 
Indonesian catch monitoring review workshop. 
 
 
  
 
10 
8.5 
Other matters 
69. The meeting agreed to the following recommendations that arose during Mr 
Penney’s presentation of the report of the Seventh meeting of the Scientific 
Committee: 
• Future Scientific Committee meetings should be allocated four full meeting days 
to conduct its business, provided that budgetary constraints do not prevent this. 
• Future Stock Assessment Group meetings should be allocated five full days, 
particularly in years when a full stock assessment is required, provided that 
budgetary constraints do not prevent this.  
• Option A of the Scientific Committee’s proposed work plan for 2003 was 
accepted. 
70. The meeting confirmed that in accepting option A of the Scientific Committees 
work plan for 2003, it also agreed that the data identified at SC7 for exchange and 
fishery indicator analysis in 2003 could be released by the Secretariat for this 
purpose. 
71. The meeting adopted the reports of the: 
• Seventh meeting of the Scientific Committee (Attachment 10); 
• CPUE modelling workshop (Attachment 12); and 
• First Management Procedure Workshop (Attachment 13). 
• The report of the Direct Age Estimation Workshop (Attachment 14) pending 
completion by members of  the working manual on otolith aging, which appears 
as Attachment E to the report, after CCSBT9. 
Agenda Item 9. 
CCSBT central database including confidentiality 
72. The meeting agreed to a revision of the data security policy of the Secretariat 
presented at Attachment 15. 
73. The meeting discussed the draft confidentiality policy for the CCSBT Central 
Database and agreed to a revision of the policy, which is presented at Attachment 
16. 
Agenda Item 10. 
Total allowable catch and its allocation 
10.1. 
Total allowable catch 
74. Members of the Extended Commission presented overviews of their respective 
positions on a total allowable catch and national allocations. 
 
  
 
11 
75. Australia stated that there was no justification for an increase in the TAC. It 
proposed that all members be responsible and stay with existing national allocations. 
Australia was concerned with the over catch of some countries, particularly when 
Australia has managed to stay within its allocation.  Australia noted the issue with 
its recreational catch and hopes to be in a position to report to CCSBT10 on how 
Australia has resolved to manage this fishery. In the interim, Australia pointed out 
that the amount of its under catch this year was sufficient to cover any recreational 
catch. 
76. The Fishing Entity of Taiwan commented that the Commission had not been able to 
reach consensus on TAC in recent years.  The Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
recommended a six-step approach that started with agreeing to a TAC, and 
proceeded to describing the steps that could then be taken towards determining 
criteria of national allocations that include the allocation of any surpluses among all 
members of the Extended Commission. 
77. Japan felt that account needed to be taken of both the Scientific Committee’s 
recommendation and socio-economic issues to establish TAC. Japan proposed that 
the 2001 catch figures be used to fix the global TAC and that national allocations 
should be discussed in a way as done last year. Japan further believed that, even if 
the global TAC is not raised, there would be surplus in the global TAC that could be 
allocated to members of the Extended Commission because of the membership of 
some non-members to the Extended Commission, while Japan reserves the right to 
request to make further adjustments on the allocation to the Members based on the 
outcome of the review of the monitoring program of the Indonesian SBT catch to be 
conducted by the Extended Commission. 
78. Regarding the terminology of TAC, Korea recognises that members of the Extended 
Commission needed to re-define what they meant by the TAC. Korea is considering 
it to be the global catch levels that should be recommended by the Scientific 
Committee to the Commission. Korea noted that the Commission’s goal was to 
obtain 1980 stock levels by 2020 and stated that Korea would respect this goal if all 
members of the Extended Commission agreed to maintain this goal. Regarding the 
specific level of TAC, Korea respects the current replacement catch level that was 
recommended by the Scientific Committee.  However, further discussions may be 
required for the interpretation of the recommendation. In relation to national 
allocations, Korea considered that this should be allocation of catch amongst 
members in proportion to national allocations that existed at the time that Korea 
joined the Commission.  
79. New Zealand stated that it accepted the rights (access) and duties (conservation and 
management) of the Convention. It noted that the Convention required the TAC to 
be set on the basis of recommendations of the Scientific Committee and in a manner 
consistent with the Commission’s management and conservation objective. The SC6 
noted that substantial quota reductions would be required to achieve the 
Commission’s goal to rebuild spawning stock levels to 1980 levels by 2020. New 
Zealand concluded that the Commission would need to reduce catch levels to meet 
these objectives. New Zealand, however, also noted that progress is being made in 
 
  
 
12 
developing and implementing the SRP and developing Management Procedures. 
While this was being finalised, New Zealand could agree to maintain catches at 
previously agreed levels. New Zealand also noted that if in the future scientific 
advice supported an increase in the TAC, the CCSBT had already agreed on an 
allocation mechanism for the increase in catch. 
80. The Chair noted that there had been extensive discussions between members, 
conducted with goodwill. Regretfully agreement could not be reached. The Chair 
encouraged members to resolve the issue of TAC and national allocations out of 
session. 
10.2. 
National allocations 
81. There was no additional discussion of national allocations. 
Agenda Item 11. 
Trade Information Scheme review 
82. The Executive Secretary introduced the review of the CCSBT Trade Information 
Scheme that was prepared by the Secretariat and provided with paper CCSBT-
EC/0210/14. 
83. Members of the Extended Commission agreed to the following recommendations of 
this paper: 
• Recommendation 1 (minimum standards for TIS documents) was agreed, but the 
Extended Commission noted that further discussion is required to determine the 
essential information that would be required as part of the minimum standard as 
well as potential problems when applying such minimum standards. 
• Recommendation 2 (improved processes of exporters and importers) was agreed 
provided that point three of this recommendation was extended to include 
exports to non-members. 
• Recommendation 3 (provide reconciliation of TIS documents). Option B of this 
recommendation was adopted in preference to option A. 
• Recommendation 4 (extending the reporting timeframe for the Secretariat) was 
agreed, but with changes in the recommended reporting dates from 1 May to 1 
June, and from 1 November to 1 December. 
• Recommendation 5 (changes to the reporting format of Annex 2 for 
confidentiality reasons). It was agreed that Annex 2 would not be changed and 
that the Secretariat would report in accordance with Annex 2. 
• Recommendation 6 (the Review of Indonesian catch monitoring should consider 
issues affecting the accuracy of TIS data from Indonesia) was agreed and the 
terms of reference of the Indonesian catch monitoring review had already been 
amended to include this requirement. 
 
  
 
13 
• Recommendation 7 (further comparison of Korean catch and TIS data) would 
proceed through intersessional discussions between the Secretariat and Korea. 
84. Australia and New Zealand expressed concerns with the major weakness of the TIS 
scheme that was mentioned in the review, which is that it is a trade only scheme and 
does not record catches that are not exported to a CCSBT member, including 
Japan’s entire catch.  Australia, Korea and New Zealand expressed their view that 
the CCSBT needs to move to a catch documentation scheme such as that operated 
by CCAMLR. 
85. New Zealand recommended that the Secretariat be tasked to document the 
alternative trade and catch information systems operated by RFMO’s. New Zealand 
suggested that this should be completed prior to the review of the Indonesian catch 
monitoring workshop.  
86. Japan pointed out that the original purpose of the TIS was to better account for the 
catch from non-members and that catch by the Members was already being reported 
to the Extended Commission. In this context, the TIS was properly constructed for 
its purpose. Japan’s view was that the existing trade information scheme has only 
been in operation for two years, and that the existing scheme should be improved as 
much as possible. Japan pointed out that if the CCSBT wanted to review the TIS, it 
should first review the practices of other tuna RFMOs such as ICCAT and IOTC.  
87. The Extended Commission agreed to discuss the matters raised above further at 
CCSBT 10 Commission and Extended Commission Meeting. 
Agenda Item 12. 
Report on Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
activities 
88. The Extended Commission discussed the operational practices of the Ecological 
Related Species Working Group (ERSWG) to improve arrangements for future 
meetings.  In particular, participants commented on the frequency of the meetings, 
the volume of business and the late submission of documentation. 
89. It was agreed that the terms of reference of the ERSWG did not require 
modification to address these matters.  The solution lay more in better management 
of the business of the working group so that its work contributed more to the aims of 
the Commission.  In particular, Japan stressed that research and study of prey and 
predators should be promoted more to achieve a better balance between activities on 
such species and activities on species affected by SBT fisheries. Australia and New 
Zealand believed that more attention should be paid to data collection processes. It 
was agreed to establish a small working group to consider how to advance these 
issues. The small group agreed to: 
• endorse the draft agenda for the 5th meeting of the ERS working group at 
Attachment 9 of the report of the 4th ERSWG. (CCSBT-EC-0210/Rep07) 
 
  
 
14 
• members providing a summary of papers submitted to the working group 
meeting in their national report; and 
• intersessional consultation between members and the secretariat on how best to 
manage the business of the working group and arrangements for the preparation 
and exchange of papers and reports. 
90. The Extended Commission endorsed the outcomes from the small group. 
91. The Extended Commission noted the importance of finalising the drafts of the shark 
and seabird pamphlets in 2002 and requested that all members of the Extended 
Commission make efforts to complete the work in this timeframe. 
92. Japan asked the meeting to consider its recommendation for revised guidelines on 
the deployment of Tori lines. Australia and New Zealand agreed that this was a 
useful addition to the existing guidelines, provided that the guidelines are not seen 
as prescriptive. It was noted that the guidelines may not be suited to smaller longline 
vessels. As new members to the Extended Commission, Korea and the Fishing 
Entity of Taiwan raised their concerns about making decisions during this meeting 
and thus requested time for further consideration and domestic consultation on this 
guideline. 
93. The Extended Commission discussed the frequency of meetings. The time between 
meetings was considered to be contrary to the effective management of the working 
group’s business.  It was agreed that a meeting should be scheduled for next year 
and that to save costs, this should be held back to back with other meetings. New 
Zealand suggested that the Commission adopt the general principle that, whenever 
possible, meetings be held back to back to minimise costs. The Secretariat was 
asked to report back on the best way to achieve this. 
94. The meeting adopted the report of the Fourth meeting of the Ecologically Related 
Species Working Group (Attachment 17). 
Agenda Item 13. 
Research Mortality Allowance (RMA) and mortality from 
SRP 
13.1. 
Reports from members on RMA and SRP mortality in 2001 
and 2002 
95. Members noted the RMA and SRP mortalities for 2001/02 as presented in paper 
CCSBT-EC/0210/16. 
96. Australia noted that the mortalities from its east coast tagging pilot were sold and 
that the proceeds were provided to the CCSBT.  Australia advised that it planned to 
do the same for 2003. 
 
 
 
  
 
15 
13.2. 
Advice from members on RMA and SRP mortality for 2002 
and 2003 
97. Japan advised that it sought an RMA mortality totalling 6.5 tonnes for its planned 
research and an additional 10 tonne of SRP mortality allowance for its pilot tagging 
program in the west Indian Ocean. 
98. Australia advised that it expected that it would require approximately 15 tonnes of 
SRP mortality for its 2003 east coast tagging. 
99. New Zealand advised that it may require up to 2.5 tonnes of SRP mortality 
allowance if it is able to conduct tagging during June to August of 2003. 
100. The meeting agreed with Japan’s request for 6.5 tonne of RMA.  The meeting also 
agreed to a total of 40 tonnes of SRP mortality allowance, which would include the 
CCSBT surface tagging program in southern and western Australia and the tagging 
proposals outlined above. 
101. Discussion was held on the use of funds from the sale of mortalities approved 
under the RMA or the SRP.  Australia and New Zealand believed that the proceeds 
pending should be provided to the CCSBT.  New Zealand suggested that the 
Extended Commission adopt a principle to this effect. However, Japan advised that 
its domestic regulations did not allow it to follow a similar arrangement.  
Agenda Item 14. 
Program of work for 2003 
102. The Extended Commission agreed to the program of work for 2003 set out in 
Attachment 18 and the meeting schedule for 2003 listed in Attachment 19. 
103. The Extended Commission agreed that five days should be provided for the 2003 
SAG meeting. 
104. The Secretariat was invited to prepare precise meeting dates in discussion with 
members of the Extended Commission, making provision for as many back to back 
meetings as is reasonable. 
Agenda Item 15. 
Activities with other organisations 
15.1. 
IOTC annual meeting 
105. The Extended Commission noted the report from the Executive Secretary. 
106. The Extended Commission noted the importance of maintaining direct contact 
with the IOTC. The Executive Secretary should make a judgment on attendance at 
IOTC meetings in consultation with members of the Extended Commission, taking 
into account the relevance of the agendas to CCSBT interests. It was agreed that the 
Executive Secretary would write to the IOTC advising of the admission of the 
Fishing Entity of Taiwan to the Extended Commission and its involvement in the 
CCSBT. 
 
  
 
16 
15.2. 
Regional fisheries bodies meetings 
107. The Extended Commission agreed to develop a general approach for the Executive 
Secretary to present at the 3rd meeting of Regional Fisheries Bodies intersessionaly. 
The Secretariat was asked to coordinate this exercise over the reminder of 2002 
15.3. 
Relevant meetings of FAO bodies including the 
Coordinating Working Party of Fisheries Statistics (CWP) 
108. The Extended Commission noted that the Secretariat would be represented it at the 
CWP meeting in January 2003 and the 3rd meeting of the Regional Fisheries Bodies 
in March 2003. The Extended Commission indicated that the CCSBT would benefit 
from participation at COFI and that the Executive Secretary attend given the 
minimal budget implications. 
Agenda Item 16. 
Confidentiality of Commission Documents 
109. The meeting agreed that all documents produced for CCSBT 9 meetings could be 
made publicly available. 
Agenda Item 17.

Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan to the Admission 
Canberra October 15-18, 2002 
 
 
Thank you Mr. Chairman. First of all, on behalf of our delegation, I would like to 
extend our sincere appreciation to the efforts made and the assistance rendered by all 
members for our accession to the Extended Commission and the Extended Scientific 
Committee. Without your efforts, the Resolution to Establish an Extended 
Commission and an Extended Scientific Committee can not be adopted by the 
Commission at 7th Commission meeting and we can not accede to the Extended 
Commission in such a short time.  
 
Noting that in recent years the international and various regional fisheries 
management organizations have called for coastal states and all fishing states to 
cooperate with each other for the conservation and sustainable utilization of highly 
migratory fish stocks, and also noting the imperative international responsibility 
concerning the conservation of the resource of Southern Bbluefin Tuna in the three 
oceans for the need of present and future generations, we know we have the duty for 
the conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. We therefore do our best efforts to 
conquer all barriers to apply for admission as a member of the Extended Commission 
of CCSBT after negotiation with CCSBT in length. 
 
As all of you may be aware, after exchange of letters with CCSBT, we have worked 
very hard on processing necessary domestic legal procedures in order to accede to the 
Extended Commission as early as possible. Due to our special status at CCSBT, we 
have to make strenuous efforts on persuading our authorities concerned and 
legislators about the importance of our accession to CCSBT for the sustainable 
utilization of Southern Bluefin Tuna, and finally completed our domestic legal 
procedures. 
 
I would like to take this opportunity to reassert that we commit to respect the terms of 
the Convention and comply with such decisions of the Extended Commission as 
become decisions of the Commission. Although we are not satisfied with our current 
status at CCSBT, we are more than happy to have the opportunity to cooperate with 
other members in improving the resources of SBT, so as to achieve the ends of 
conservation and sustainable utilization of the SBT stock. 
 
 
2 
For further taking our obligation on long-term conservation of SBT stock more 
efficiently, we sincerely request the Commission’s deliberation on improving our 
status in the future to grant us a full member in CCSBT.

Australian Opening Statement CCSBT 9 
Canberra 15-18 October 2002. 
 
 
Let me begin by welcoming to Australia the members of the CCSBT, Japan, NZ and 
Korea and I trust that you will enjoy your stay.  Of particular importance at this 
meeting is the admission of Taiwan to the Extended Commission of the CCSBT.  
Australia has a long association with Taiwan over fishing and it is very pleasing to be 
able to welcome you as an equal partner in the CCSBT, its discussions and decision-
making processes. 
 
We also have with us at this meeting representative for Indonesia and South Africa. 
As range states for this species I am delighted that you could attend this meeting.  I 
note that South Africa has asked for membership for the CCSBT and I trust that this 
can be finalised at this meeting. I hope that your presence here flags a longer-term 
commitment of active engagement in this Commission.   
 
I would like to acknowledge also the continued constructive involvement that the 
external scientist and chairs have with the members of the CCSBT and look forward 
to parties agreeing to continue this association at this meeting.  To our interpreters 
great to see you again and as always if I confuse you let me know.  I would also like 
to thank Brian MacDonald and his team at the CCSBT Secretariat for the professional 
way that they have conducted the business of the CCSBT over the last year.  
 
Australia is generally pleased with the progress and direction of the CCSBT and 
believe that with some good will from the parties we can build this into one of the best 
fisheries Commission in the world but this will not happen unless we co-operate to 
make it so. We have a fairly full agenda in front of us and I would like to touch briefly 
in Australia’s opening statement on the importance to Australia of some of these 
agenda items.   
 
Non-members 
 
As I have noted it is satisfying to see all nations who are involved in the fishery at this 
point in time at the table today.  If we are to continue to move forward and I believe 
that in this Commission we will; we need to finalise arrangements for both South 
Africa and Indonesia to participate as a matter of priority.  Australia for its part is 
prepared in line with our UNCLOS obligations to be reasonably flexible to ensure 
their membership and co-operation with the CCSBT. I am aware that Australia and 
Japan have been working to try to finalise a “co-operating non-member” arrangement 
for Indonesia and I trust that we can finalise agreement on this arrangement at this 
meeting.   
 
Action Plan 
 
Australia notes that we will have to decide at this meeting whether we take trade 
measures against those countries that will not co-operate with the CCSBT and 
continue to trade in SBT.  The four that have been identified are Cambodia, 
Honduras, Belize and Equatorial Guinea. There are however problems in this area and 
it centres on two issues: the need to be WTO consistent with our approach and as such 
members need to agree to national allocations before we can take action against other 
non-members. The second issue is that there have been no imports listed on the 
Japanese TIS from these four countries since 2000.  This in its self raises a number 
of questions. 
 
SRP Funding 
 
In the past year Australia has made significant contributions to moving forward the 
SRP in relation to tagging studies in Australian waters.  We believe that it is 
particularly important that all countries now commit to ongoing funding for the SRP.  
There should be funding made available particularly to support port monitoring and 
observer programs in both domestic and high seas fisheries.  
 
Total Allowable Catches 
 
Australia is concerned that since the meeting in Miyako, the parties have not been able 
to finalise national allocations for SBT.  This is in spite of considerable efforts from 
Australia.  Our position in relation to the TAC is quite clear and we believe that all 
countries should stay with their last agreed national allocations until the next stock 
assessment provides us all with a way forward. This we believe is the clear message 
that has been given to the CCSBT from the external scientists. All countries need to 
be responsible, regulated and controlled in managing their catch. 
 
Trade Information scheme 
 
Australia believes that the information coming from this scheme is inaccurate and is 
distorting the understanding of the real trade in SBT. As such the TIS must be 
reviewed in full as part of the review of the Indonesian Catch Monitoring program.  
All countries have an obligation under the WTO to be consistent in the application of 
trade measures, and so the scheme must include all catch and landing data into Japan 
from its domestic fleet.  It is untenable that we can continue to proceed with a 
scheme that has so many basic gaps in the information that it provides to members. 
We will be pursuing at this meeting the variation in the TIS data for various countries. 
 
Spawning Ground 
 
At the last meeting Japan suggested that we look at a method of preventing fishing on 
the spawning ground due to its importance to the long-term health of the fishery.  
Australia remains concerned at the level of fishing in this area and would propose that 
this meeting have a preliminary discussion on what we might be able to do in relation 
to this suggestion. 
 
Ladies and gentlemen this is our basic position in relation to SBT and the issues with 
which we are concerned and wish to pursue at this meeting.  I look forward to a 
constructive and progressive CCSBT 9 and one that will prove useful for both the 
members and the fish. 
 
 
Attachment 5-2 
Opening Statement at CCSBT9   
Canberra October 15-18 2002 
Taiwan 
Thank you Mr. Chairman.  At this historical moment, on behalf of my delegation, I 
wish to express our pleasure to be here participating in the Ninth CCSBT Commission 
meeting, and in particular, the First Extended Commission meeting as a member of the 
Extended Commission. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Government of Australia for 
hosting this meeting.  My thanks also extend to the Secretariat under the leadership of 
Mr. Brian McDonald for its logistic arrangement. 
Upon becoming a member of the Extended Commission, we realize the obligation 
ahead, and we commit ourselves to make every effort to cooperate with all other 
members for achieving the goal of long-term conservation and sustainable utilization of 
the SBT stock. We will make constructive contribution to CCSBT. However, as a New 
member for just about two months, we understand we have to work hard to get 
acquainted with the process of CCSBT, and we will appreciate it very much if the 
Members and the Secretariat can provide us necessary assistance. 
There are a lot issues that we are concerned about in this meeting, such as the 
development of Scientific Observer Program Standard.  We understand that there were 
substantial discussions on this matter in the Seventh Scientific Committee meeting and 
a revised draft was produced for further considerations by members.  The progress is 
encouraging, but we would like to point out that we do have difficulties in achieving the 
10% target level as agreed upon previously by the Commission.  As to the Standard, 
we would like to see it could be as simple, clear, and most importantly, as practical and 
achievable, as possible. 
 
We recognize that catch statistics is of high importance to SBT stock assessment and 
fishery management, and we note that accuracy of SBT catch statistics has greatly 
improved a lot since the implementation of TIS in year 2000.  However, we think there 
still are some further progresses are yet to be made, such as the clarification of 
Indonesian catch statistics.  As such, we see the need of having a collaborative review 
on the monitoring program of Indonesian SBT catch.  We hope all the catch statistics, 
for exporting or domestic consumption, from exporting nations or importing nations, 
should be as transparent as possible. 
As a member who makes contributions, we are also interested and concerned about the 
financial situation of CCSBT.  We believe some person from our side should spend 
more time in the working of the Finance and Administrative Committee.  For that 
purpose, we would like to nominate a person to take up such duty.  Our goal, which we 
believe is consistent with that of other members, is to ensure operation of the 
Committee be cost-effective. 
We recognize that the legal status of a member of the Extended Commission is different 
from that of the Commission.  To fulfill our obligation on long-term conservation of 
SBT stock, we sincerely request the Commission’s deliberations on improving our 
status in the future, to be a full member of CCSBT. 
Finally, we look forward to fruitful outcomes from this meeting, and under your able 
guidance, Mr. Chairman, many substantial issues can be resolved.  Thank you.

Opening Statement 
The 9th Annual Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT9) 
15 October 2002 
Japan 
 
 
1. Thank you Chairman. 
 
I am Akira Nakamae, Councillor of the Fisheries Agency of the Government of 
Japan. I was appointed to take over Mr Yuge’s duties last April including his 
responsibility as  the CCSBT Commissioner. This is my first participation in a 
formal CCSBT-related meeting, such as an annual meeting. I would like to 
contribute positively to the meeting over the next four days from both angles of 
the objective of the CCSBT convention, which are conservation and the 
optimum utilization of SBT. 
 
2. First, I sincerely welcome the “Fishing Entity of Taiwan” for its first formal 
participation in the Extended Commission of CCSBT.  Though the “Fishing 
Entity of Taiwan” has participated as an observer at CCSBT meetings for a long 
time to date, from this meeting, a new arrangement is provided for the “Fishing 
Entity of Taiwan” to participate in discussions, and to fulfill its responsibilities 
on all important matters concerning the conservation and management of SBT 
on an equal footing with other commission members. In this context we expect 
further contributions in the future from the “Fishing Entity of Taiwan” to the 
CCSBT. 
 
3. Two years have passed rapidly since the conclusion of the international tribunal 
case, which arose from different views on the stock assessment of SBT. In the 
meantime, activities within CCSBT toward improving its scientific functions, 
such as the development of the framework and implementation of the Scientific 
Research Program (SRP) including CPUE interpretation, the tagging program, 
the scientific observer program and characterization of SBT catch as well as 
improvement of stock assessment methods and commencement of management 
procedure development, have made remarkable progress. In particular, I would 
like to emphasize the significant contributions of the independent scientists and 
independent chairs of the Scientific Committee and the Stock Assessment Group 
in this progress.  In order to realize future progress on conservation and 
sustainable utilization of SBT based on scientific basis, we have to continue to 
make all our efforts and cooperate each other fully without losing this 
momentum while considering priorities at scientific discussions. I would also 
hope that the continued initiative from independent scientists and independent 
chairs for this progress. 
 
Concerning the development of the management procedure, which has been 
given priority by the Scientific Committee, it is necessary that we instruct 
national scientists to complete development by the due date of March 2004 at 
this meeting. 
 
4. Regarding the stock assessment of SBT, as a result of the review of several 
fisheries indicators, a series of scientific meetings held in 2002 did not conduct 
model based full stock assessments. Also, the Scientific Committee held last 
September concluded that there were no reasons to change the recommendations 
to management made last year. It was regrettable that in spite of virtual 
agreement on a global TAC last year, we could not agree on it consequently 
because some countries opposed agreeing to it by reason of no agreement on 
national allocations. The global TAC is established based on advice of the 
Scientific Committee and discussions on national allocations should be regarded 
as quite a different matter. At this meeting I do hope that we can agree on a 
global TAC at least. 
 
5. Actions towards non-members and the construction of relationships with them 
are key issues if we are to have comprehensive resources management. These 
measures will have to be reinforced. In this regard, I would like to welcome 
participation of Indonesia and South Africa as observers and would like to 
request these countries various corporations.  For example, it is imperative in 
term of resource management for us to obtain the cooperation of Indonesia 
which has spawning grounds off it, and where there are many uncertainties 
relating to its SBT catches. We have to pursue their cooperation vigorously.  
 
Also this is the first time that we have observers from headquarters of the 
government in South Africa rather than representatives from diplomatic posts. 
We hope they will endorse the conservation policies for SBT and become a 
formal member of the CCSBT unconditionally and immediately. 
 
Furthermore, the commission has to express a resolute attitude to countries that 
have not responded despite our requests to cooperate with the Commission in 
accordance with the Action Plan   
 
6. Lastly, I would like to express my gratitude to the Secretariat and the 
Government of Australia, which made significant effort for preparation of this 
annual meeting to be held in this beautiful place. The Japanese delegation hopes 
that this meeting will be a fruitful one and as a result, relationships between 
members and improvement in the CCSBT’s function will be further enhanced. 
 
Thank you.

NEW ZEALAND OPENING STATEMENT 
 
 
Good morning ladies and gentlemen. We are looking forward to working with the 
delegations from Australia, Japan, Korea and Taiwan under the guidance of our new 
chair, Mr Quinlivan. We are very pleased to note that over the last couple of meetings 
the list of Parties to the Convention has increased steadily.  
 
The Commission has always placed the highest priority on enlarging its membership to 
include all those who have an interest in the fishery. We are pleased that the 
Commission’s commitment to this goal is continuing to bear fruit..  We are pleased to 
welcome Taiwan as a member of the Extended Commission.  
 
The delegation from Taiwan has participated in several meetings as an observer as 
arrangements have been worked through to bring them to full participation in our 
deliberations. My Delegation is pleased to recall the role it played in bringing this about 
and look forward to continuing close dialogue and cooperation with Taiwan. 
 
We also extend a warm welcome to the representatives from Indonesia and South Africa 
who are with us.  We still need to actively continue negotiations with non-members to 
determine the steps required to achieve closer co-operation, and to further expand the 
Commission to include all key SBT fishing nations over time. In the meantime we 
regard restraint of non-members catch as an essential component of an improved 
potential for stock rebuild.  
 
Expansion of the Commission is one of the main achievements of this body since the 
resolution of an unfortunate dispute between members.  That dispute was time-
consuming and costly – not just in financial terms for Members, but in terms of 
achieving the Commission’s long-term objectives with regard to management of the 
fish-stock as well.   
 
New Zealand has greatly appreciated the way in which all CCSBT Members have 
worked constructively to return the body to a functional level, and to agree by 
consensus to a series of actions to be taken to ensure that this trend continues in future.   
 
One of the principal steps taken in this regard has been the establishment of the external 
Scientific Research Programme.  We are also pleased with the progress that has been 
achieved in relation to the implementation of the scientific research programme. In this 
regard we would like to thank Australia and Japan for the financial commitments they 
have made to run their national tagging programmes. We are also pleased with the 
progress that has been made in the development of management procedures.   
 
We look forward to the outcomes of the Scientific Research Programme, and the greater 
scientific clarity that it will provide to our discussions on the management of the 
fishery. 
NZ.DOC

24/10/02 09:25 A.M. 
 
The Commission has undertaken a significant amount of scientific work since its 
inception in 1993. This work has played a critical role in the setting of catch levels that 
are consistent with conservation and management objectives. In this regard we are 
particularly conscious of the stock rebuilding objectives the Commission has committed 
itself to.  Scientific input to the management process cannot be under overlooked, to do 
so would be inconsistent with the principles enshrined in the Convention. 
 
The Convention also identifies the principles that must be applied when allocating catch 
amongst both existing and future members of the Commission. We must bear in mind 
and act in a manner that is consistent with the Convention’s allocation principles when 
catch allocations are being discussed. In this regard New Zealand will draw members 
attention on earlier discussions that have held by the Commission. 
 
New Zealand considers that the solid efforts we have all made to improve the 
functionality of the Commission must be continued if we are to achieve our aims.   
 
This week, we hope we can hold on to the principles of cooperation and flexibility that 
have underpinned those efforts.  Another return to deadlock and dispute would have a 
serious impact on the ability of this body to achieve its aims.   
 
We look forward to working constructively with you over the next few days. While we 
know we may have some difficult decisions to make we are also confident that we all 
have the same objective in mind: the long-term sustainability of the resource so that 
both our and future generations can benefit from it. 
 
Finally Mr Chairman we are conscious that this meeting is taking place in the shadow of 
the tragic events in Bali. We would like to take this opportunity to extend our sympathy 
to all those who have been affected by this event. 
 
Thank you.

Ninth Annual Meeting of the Commission 
15 - 18 October 2002 
Canberra, Australia 
Korea’s Opening Statement 
 
Good morning!   
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen.   
On behalf of Korean delegation, I am greatly honored to be here in Canberra for 
the ninth CCSBT meeting.  We extend special gratitude to the Government of Australia 
and Canberra for providing this excellent venue to hold our meeting.  We also 
appreciate the Executive Secretary of the CCSBT, Mr. Brian Macdonald, and all the 
Secretariat’s staff for their insight and hard work during the last intersessional period. 
Mr. Chairman and distinguished delegates. 
CCSBT is entering another new phase in its structure and function.  From the 
original three-member structure of the past, we now have a structure including all major 
fishing states and one major fishing entity.  In addition, Indonesia and South Africa are 
expected to accede to the Convention sooner or later.   
Functions and activities of the Commission including scientific research, catch 
monitoring, designing the observer program and constructing a central database, have 
shown outstanding progress since last meeting.  Without the strenuous efforts of the 
Executive Director and staff, and full understanding and cooperation by Member States, 
the current progress could not be attained within this short time limit.  Such expansion 
and development of the Commission’s structure and functions have been clearly based 
on mutual understanding of the fishery structures of individual Member States.   
Many pending issues await us.  Korea expects all such issues like assessing stock 
conditions, establishing a TAC, allocating national quotas, conducting scientific 
research, and appropriating required funds to be resolved through full discussion and 
understanding of the goals of the Convention.   
Once again, Korea deeply congratulates Taiwan on its membership of the Extended 
Commission and hopes for continuous cooperation for the conservation of southern 
bluefin tuna. 
Thank you.

TO THE CONVENTION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF SOUTHERN BLUE 
FIN TUNA (CCSBT) 
 
 
OPENING STATEMENT BY SOUTH AFRICA TO THE NINTH ANNUAL 
MEETING OF THE COMMISSION, HELD IN CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA, FROM 
15-18 OCTOBER 2002. 
 
(Statement by Mr. Horst Kleinschmidt, Deputy Director-General in the Department of 
Environment and Tourism, responsible for Marine and Coastal Management) 
 
Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
 
I bring you the best wishes and compliments of the Government of South Africa. I want 
to thank you all most sincerely for affording me an opportunity to address you here 
today. 
 
Our presence here signals our Government’s keen interest and readiness to accede as a 
member of CCSBT. I wish to address you on the basis and reasons for such accession. 
 
Any country seeking access to a Convention such as this, and that seeks to have granted 
to itself a share of the allowable catch of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT), should be 
obliged to explain its history, motivation and track record with regard to conservation to 
the CCSBT. 
 
Mr. Chairman, allow me to provide you with the case South Africa makes. 
 
My country, at the southern tip of Africa, is only in its 8th year of democracy. As you al 
of you know the transition process has often taken place under difficult conditions. The 
orderly and lawful management of our fisheries has been no exception.  
 
In the days of apartheid a white Government awarded quota rights to a small band of 
white owned and white managed companies of not more than a few hundred. Not 
surprisingly, immediately post our first democratic elections in 1994, the number of 
rights seekers shot up to over 10,000. Our country and the Ministry I work for was not 
prepared for this new demand. A tumultuous time followed. In brief, a legally 
defensible, administratively just and transparent system had to be found that would 
ensure three critical things: transformation of the industry to reflect the demographic 
nature of our country in ownership, management and share of TAC/TAE in each 
fishery, stability to allow for a vibrant and competitive fishing industry and thirdly, 
ensuring adherence to our management protocols and an adhered to compliance through 
better law enforcement. 
 
It is with some pride and a great deal of pleasure that I can inform you that we have 
substantially succeeded in each of the three areas over the past 18 months. We have, 
recently, awarded fishing rights (quota’s) to 1,600 legal entities in 14 of the most 
important commercial fishing sectors of our country. Through this we have achieved 
significant, but not as yet full, representivity of all the people of our country as far as 
ownership, management and access to share of TAC/TAE is concerned. In fact the 
allocations have met our new standards of administrative justice, of freedom to access 
of information and, I believe, the Governments interim targets to de-racialise our 
society. Notably the number of legal challenges to the awarding of rights has 
dramatically declined and those that took us to court have all failed to date. 
 
We have, through the above also brought new stability to our industry. Annual quota 
rights have given way to four-year rights and must lead to 15-year rights. The new 
system is making it possible to re-invest in the industry, especially where vessels and 
gear is concerned. 
 
At the same time we have made new and important strides in prosecuting offenders who 
over-fished, did not report their catches or in other ways tried to deceive the authorities. 
This includes a number of incidents where vessels from other countries are involved. 
Separate to this presentation we can inform you of a string of toothfish, tuna, and 
swordfish transgression committed by foreign vessels and that we have taken action 
against in our waters or our ports recently. 
 
The most important prosecution during the past year was against a South African 
company, Hout Bay Fishing Pty. Ltd. They confessed, eventually, to over 300 counts of 
fraud and corruption. In plea-bargaining they paid the state the greatest over admission 
of guilt: R40million of close to US$5million. This also lead to the arrest of a further 18 
small operators and the dismissal of 14 of our Inspectorate. 
 
Mr. Chairman I want to demonstrate not only how we have emerged from the problems 
of the past, but also how we have been able, gradually, to establish the basis for a strong 
and vibrant new fishing industry in our country that seeks its place amongst nations, a 
place that was previously denied for obvious reasons. 
 
Be under no illusion, the South African fishing industry suffered immeasurably because 
of apartheid. Our country was rightly the target of international boycotts and this 
impacted on the fishing industry in that it could not develop or expand where other 
countries did so, throughout the 1970’s and 1980’s. 
 
I should further wish to point out, that as part of our need and desire to emerge from the 
difficult and compromised past, we have negotiated the end to preferential excess by 
other countries (i.e. Japan and Taiwan) in our waters. Those that still seek to have 
preferential access have been told, that we are involved in a concerted drive to build our 
own industry and given our past, need every means to accommodate those in our 
country who were previously excluded. 
 
It is in this context that we are now at the ready to finally rebuild our own tuna industry. 
With foreign fishing in our waters on preferential terms out of the way, we are keen to 
develop our own tuna industry by bringing our own tuna long-line experiment to an end 
and we are now looking forward to a fully-fledged own tuna industry. 
 
Let me not be misunderstood: we are not saying that we will not or are not prepared to 
work co-operatively with foreign fishing interests. We welcome foreign investment in 
our industry, including joint ventures, and my Department will facilitate in practical 
terms any arrangements that may be pursued.  
 
Let me therefore offer one key reason why, if we are to meaningfully participate, we 
seek a place at CCSBT: as a coastal developing state, we have the will, the capacity and 
the appetite to join that family of nations assembled here, and that we should form part 
of. As a country with enormous developmental needs, it would send a most important 
sign to our Government, to our industry and our country as such, if we were granted a 
quota of say 300 or 400 tons of SBT.  
 
As a developing state, we would, I have no doubt, have little capacity, if indeed any, to 
merely join on the basis of a mere prospect of a quota at some time in the future. 
 
Let me then turn to a number of pertinent and direct issues that I would like you to take 
cognisance of: 
 
1. What about us having a record, despite the apartheid history, as a nation, in the 
tuna fishery? 
 
Let me tell you first of all that South Africa may well qualify as one of the very first to 
have caught SBT from the 1960’s onwards. South Africa at the time caught around 
4,000 tons per annum. Unhappily this fishery went into decline for economic reasons 
and not least due to the boycott of our country. We thus had a SBT fishery prior to some 
of you sitting around this table. 
 
2. In more recent times and in fact right up to the end of this year, SBT was caught 
in our waters, by special concession, by Japanese and Taiwanese vessels. In 
terms of the agreements with them, we assessed and considered catch reports 
from them on a regular basis and these formed in fact the essence of our annual 
negotiations. Thus, although not caught by us, we acted as the custodians of a 
consistent catch record by foreign fleets in our waters sine the late 1970’s. These 
records are available from us for inspection. 
 
We contend, and our industry says so clearly, our capacity to develop a fully-fledged 
tuna industry in recent times, could not develop whilst others operated in our waters. 
Our position thus is that we have a valid and justifiable record of performance as I have 
explained above. 
 
I would wish to be fully and well understood with reference to the points I am making 
in regard to both the Japanese and Taiwanese participation in our waters: We seek no 
argument with either fishing nation. Having brought an end to the two arrangements, 
both of which have their roots in the apartheid era, we merely seek to normalise a 
situation that was artificially distorted due to our own past. We would like to move on, 
beyond the ending of these agreements, and continue with the fraternal relations that we 
have enjoyed with both in recent years. We do not believe that the historic anomaly is a 
reason not to co-operate on matters of mutual interest. 
 
3. We ask you to appreciate the developmental nature of what we are wishing to 
achieve. Over recent years we have established effective regulation in our long-
line industry. I have already on bringing tuna long-line industry on a full, proper 
and long term footing from now on. (We have at present some 50 tuna vessels in 
this industry.) Prior to that we brought our Hake long-line industry on a sound 
footing. The same applies to our Patagonian toothfish and shark long-line 
fisheries. 
 
In an effort to meet the socio-economic needs in our country, we have recently been 
able to attract new funds from our central treasury, to look into the science that would 
underpin the development of other fisheries in our in-shore waters that have not as yet 
been tapped. We envisage the opening up, over the next 5 years, of a further 10 to 12 
fisheries, managed on a sustainable basis in terms of our legislation. 
 
This all constitutes a drive to build our industry into a modern and responsible one. 
 
4. We should finally make the point that South Africa has a strong and proud 
record of participation in other conventions. This includes our membership of 
ICCAT and CCAMLR. Our historic record of submitting catch records and 
participation in scientific programs stands for all to see. 
5. South Africa commits itself to participate fully over issues such as observers on 
board and the fitting of VMS to our vessels.  
6. We also want to make mention of our role in southern Africa and our 
commitment to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) its 
Fisheries Protocol. The desire and intent by the region is to develop our fishing 
capacities, notably where these link us to adjacent international waters. 
7. In terms of UNCLOS, we believe that we have every right to seek access to the 
Convention and trust that you will see this similarly. 
 
 
Lastly, given the right conditions, we will be able to go back to our Minister and 
recommend accession. We do so with every will and intention of adding to the spirit 
of co-operation and international governance that the Convention stands for and has 
acted upon. We commit ourselves to act as sustainable conservationists of SBT; as 
much as anyone who is part of this convention. 
 
We trust that you will consider our need and our role in a favourable light. 
 
I thank you very much.

Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
15-18 October 2002 
Canberra, Australia 
 
 
1. Opening 
 
1. The Finance and Administration Committee met from 15-18 October 2002 in 
conjunction with CCSBT 9.  The List of Participants is attached as Annex 1 to this 
report.  Mr Paul Ross (Australia) was nominated as the Chair of the Finance and 
Administration Committee. 
 
2 Consideration of Revised 2002 Budget 
 
2. The Executive Secretary presented the proposed revision of the 2002 budget 
(CCSBT-EC/0210/05). 
 
3. The Committee noted that in the proposed Revised Budget for 2002, expenditure 
was expected to total $A 1,501,060 which is $A 148,940 less than the original 
budget.  The main reasons for the decrease are: 
 
• costs of the SAG and SC were substantially reduced because an emergency SAG 
was not required; 
 
• Age Estimation Workshop, CPUE Modelling Workshop and Management 
Procedure Workshop costs were less than originally estimated; and 
 
• no intersessional work was undertaken on the SRP. 
 
4. The proposed Revised Budget for 2002, and Taiwan’s admission to the Extended 
Commission results in a $A 229,183 surplus for 2002 that the Secretariat suggested 
could be transferred to 2003, resulting in significant reductions to membership 
contributions for that year.  However, given that it is unlikely there will be a surplus 
in the following year, this would result in membership contributions increasing 
significantly again in 2004.  The Committee expressed concern about such large 
increases and decreases in membership contributions from year to year. 
 
5. The Committee discussed ways to reduce the 2002 surplus being carried forward to 
2003.  Members recommended that part of the surplus should be set aside in a 
reserved fund to cover the costs of replacing the Deputy Executive Secretary.  This 
reduces the surplus from $A 229,183 to $A 125,183.  It was further recommended 
that $101,460 be set aside in the reserved fund to cover the cost of a special 
assessment planning meeting if needed in 2003.  This further reduces the surplus 
carried over to 2003 to $23,723. 
 
6. The Committee recommends that the 2002 Special Budget – 1 for the SRP Tagging 
Program (surface fishery) be endorsed by the Extended Commission. 
 
7. Japan raised an issue with the 2002 Special Budget – 2 SRP Pilot Tagging Program 
(east coast longline fishery) and the balance of $A 139,425 from the sale of 
mortalities.  Japan did not accept that a special fund should be established to cover 
the expenditure of this Australian pilot program.  Japan recommended that the 
income derived from the sale of mortalities be incorporated as a contribution from 
Australia into 2002 Special Budget – 1. 
 
8. The Committee agreed to discuss how the income from the east coast longline pilot 
tagging program could be utilised during its consideration of the 2003 budget. 
 
9. The adjustments above have been made by the Secretariat and the most up-to-date 
versions of the proposed Revised General Budget and Special Budgets for 2002 are 
attached (Attachment A) for consideration and approval by the Extended 
Commission. 
 
3. Consideration of the 2003 Budget 
 
10. The Executive Secretary presented the proposed 2003 budget (CCSBT-
EC/0210/06). 
 
11. The Committee based its discussion on Option A of the proposed General Budget in 
accordance with the Extended Commission’s decision on its preferred option for the 
stock assessment process for 2003. 
 
12. The Committee recommends that the Extended Commission agree to the addition of 
$A 41,000 to meet the costs of running an ERSWG meeting in 2003.  The 
Committee noted that the Secretariat had already made provision in its 2003 budget 
proposals to meet the costs of the Indonesian Monitoring Program Workshop as 
agreed to by the Extended Commission.  The Committee also noted that the 
Secretariat had already made provisions in the proposed budget, based on the 
recommendation of the SC, for additional days for the SAG/SC meetings in 2003. 
 
13. The Executive Secretary recommended that the budget for the SRP surface tagging 
program be increased by $A 50,000 to allow 30 days of tagging in South Australia, 
in line with the SC recommendation.  This would increase the total SRP surface 
tagging budget to $A 614,000.  New Zealand recommended that the balance 
remaining from the sale of SBT from the pilot east coast longline tagging program 
($A 139,425) be deducted from the SRP surface tagging budget, leaving a balance of 
$A 474,575.  Japan further recommended that the coordination costs of the SRP 
surface tagging program ($A 52,000) be reallocated to the General Budget.  These 
amendments lead to a proposed budget level for the SRP surface tagging program 
for 2003 totalling $A 422,575.  New Zealand and Japan requested that this amount, 
which represents the tagging deployment costs be presented as a Special Budget in 
2003. 
 
14. The Committee noted that the surface tagging was an integral component of the SRP 
and therefore all members have agreed to fund it.  Japan explained its view that 
because the contributions were not “voluntary”, alternative funding mechanisms 
under Financial Regulations 7.2 and 7.3 could not be used.  In noting its intention to 
pay, Japan said that it would not be able to confirm that funding had been secured 
until late December 2002. 
 
15. Japan requested that Australia make a larger contribution than calculated, taking into 
account the economic benefits derived from undertaking this activity.  Australia 
reminded the Committee that it had funded the entire surface tagging program in 
2001 and that the proceeds from mortalities in the pilot east coast longline tagging 
program were provided to the CCSBT, unlike the procedure followed by Japan. 
 
16.  New Zealand and Taiwan proposed that members’ contributions to the SRP surface 
tagging Special Budget be apportioned according to national allocation rather than 
using the General Budget formula.  New Zealand explained that scientific research 
underpins accurate stock assessments, which in turn underpins national allocations; 
and that accordingly, the benefits of the SRP are proportional to national allocations.  
The Committee agreed to refer this matter to the Extended Commission for 
consideration.  There was no consensus in the Extended Commission on New 
Zealand and Taiwan’s proposal.  It was agreed that the General Budget formula 
should be applied for 2003 only and that a review should be undertaken to establish 
guidelines for the funding of future scientific activities of the Extended Commission 
before next year’s meeting. 
 
17. The Executive Secretary advised that on the basis of the financial commitments 
made by some members he would be able to commit to undertake the surface 
tagging program, commencing on 1 December 2002, but emphasised that 
commitments by remaining members would be essential for the successful 
implementation of the Program. 
 
18. The Executive Secretary has revised the 2003 General Budget and 2003 Special 
Budget to include the recommendations of the Committee and are attached 
(Attachment B) for consideration and approval by the Extended Commission.

DECISION REGARDING BELIZE PURSUANT TO THE 2000 ACTION PLAN 
 
 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (the Commission), 
 
Recalling that the Commission has recognised that cooperation by Belize is necessary 
for the effective conservation and management of SBT;  
 
Recalling also that the Commission has since 1996 sought to establish cooperative 
arrangements with Belize to ensure the proper conservation and management of the SBT 
stock; 
 
Noting the adoption by the Commission of the Action Plan on non-members in March 
2000; 
 
Noting also the decision of April 2001, reinforced in October 2001, to identify Belize 
pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Action Plan as a non-member the vessels of which have 
been fishing for SBT in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of conservation 
and management measures for SBT; 
 
Considering that the Commission has written to Belize formally requesting that it rectify 
its fishing activities so as not to diminish the effectiveness of conservation and 
management measures for SBT and to advise the Commission of actions taken in that 
regard; 
 
Considering also that there has been a limited response from Belize indicating some 
willingness to cooperate with the Commission, but that it is unable to provide 
information on fishing vessels until domestic measures are put in place to collect such 
information; 
 
Expressing concern that the fishing activities of Belize continue to undermine the 
effectiveness of conservation and management measures for SBT; 
 
DECIDES as follows: 
 
1. 
That Belize be identified pursuant to paragraph 5 of the Action Plan, as a non-
member which has not rectified its fishing activities so as not to diminish the 
effectiveness of conservation and management measures adopted by the Commission. 
 
2. 
To instruct the Executive Secretary to write to Belize on behalf of the 
Commission, informing it of the decision of the Commission to identify Belize under 
paragraph 5 of the Action Plan, and again request that it take action to cooperate with 
the Commission and rectify its fishing activities so as not to diminish the effectiveness 
of conservation and management measures for SBT.  
 
3. 
To also instruct the Executive Secretary to inform Belize that unless the 
Commission receives a satisfactory response to its latest request prior to its next annual 
meeting, the Commission will consider imposing trade-restrictive measures, which 
avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade, to 
prevent Belize from continuing to conduct fishing activities which diminish the 
effectiveness of conservation and management measures for SBT. 
 
4. 
That at its next annual meeting, the Commission shall decide on appropriate 
measures, consistent with paragraph 6 of the Action Plan, which may include 
prohibiting the import of SBT and its products in any form from Belize unless the 
Commission decides at that meeting or before, that Belize has taken appropriate action 
to ensure that its fishing activities do not diminish conservation and management 
measures for SBT.

Update of the Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery  
for the 1999/00 and 2000/01 Season,  
Prepared by Jay Hender (AFFA) and Andy Bodsworth (AFMA) 1 October 2002 
 
1. 
Introduction 
The Australian Domestic SBT  catch for the 1999-00 quota year (1 December 1999 to 30 November 
2000) was 5257 tonnes.  The catch for the  2000-01 quota year(1 December 2000 to 30 November 
2001) was 5247 tonnes. 
 
2. 
Operational Constraints on Catch 
Regulatory Measures 
Domestic operations are managed through individual transferable quotas (ITQs) granted as statutory 
Fishing Rights (SFRs) under the Southern Bluefin Tuna Management Plan 1995.  Although the global 
total allowable catch (TAC) has not been determined by the Commission since 1998, Australia agreed to 
maintain its national catch limit at 5265 tonnes, which has remained unchanged since 1989-90. 
 
Australia continued with restricted access arrangements to reduce the incidental catch of SBT in the 
domestic longline fishery.  Longline fishers that did not hold adequate quota to cover incidental catch of 
SBT in areas of high abundance were prohibited from fishing in such areas.  Those operators who were 
granted access were subject to a range of additional monitoring and compliance conditions including 
Vessel Monitoring Systems, and observer coverage.   
 
3. 
Catch and Effort 
The SBT landings each season were: 
1999-00 
South Australia 
 
5143 tonnes (5130 tonnes in farms and 13 tonnes longline) 
and Western Australia 
 
New South Wales  
 
114 tonnes (longline) 
and Tasmania 
2000-01 
South Australia  
 
5168 tonnes (5162 tonnes in farms and 6 tonnes longline) 
and Western Australia 
 
New South Wales  
 
32 Tonnes (longline) 
and Tasmania 
 
SBT caught for fish farms in South Australia, using purse seine vessels, utilise 98.6% of the Australian 
quota, with the remainder taken by longline.  There were no SBT poled off South Australia or trolled off 
Tasmania during either season.  The Australian catch by gear and state for the quota years 1988-89 to 
2000-01 is shown in Table 1.  The Australian catch of SBT in calendar years 2000 and 2001 is mapped 
on Figures 1 & 2 respectively. 
 
4. 
Historical Catch and Effort 
Major restructuring occurred in Australia’s SBT fisheries following reductions in the global TAC and 
national catch allocations in the 1980s.  Attachment A summarises the catch taken by each sector of the 
Australian industry since 1988-89.  Confidentiality guidelines prevent the release of data from groups of 
less than 5 boats, therefore data are combined for some fishing methods. 
 
5. 
Annual Fleet Size and Distribution 
In 2000–01, a total of 57 commercial fishing vessels landed SBT in Australian waters. One longline 
vessel fished in more than one state during the 2000–01 season.  
South Australia 
The one- to five-year-old SBT, which school from late spring to autumn in surface waters of the eastern 
Great Australian Bight, were fished by eight purse seiners during the 2000–01 quota year, but various 
live bait, pontoon-towing and feeding vessels were also involved.  Two longline vessels also reported 
taking SBT from these waters during 2000–01. Fishing commenced in late December 2000 and finished 
in March 2001.  
Western Australia  
Seventeen longliners caught a small quantity SBT off the WA coastline in 2000–01. For confidentiality 
reasons all catches are incorporated in the SA longline catch.  
New South Wales 
During 2000–01, 37 domestic longliners participated at some time in the area of the fishery for older 
juveniles and adults in deeper waters off NSW in winter. Longline fishing off NSW commenced in May 
2001 and finished in November 2001.  
Tasmania 
Only two longline vessels operated during the 2000–01 quota year because of the non-availability of 
quota.  For confidentiality reasons all catches are incorporated in the NSW longline catch. 
 
6. 
Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
Australians began fishing SBT in the early 1950s off New South Wales and South Australia and then later 
(1970) off Western Australia.  The catch peaked at 21 500 tonnes in 1982.  Historically, the bulk of the 
Australian catch had been used for canning. 
 
Progressively over the mid to late 1980s, the Australian catch focussed on supplying the Japanese sashimi 
market, with an increasing amount of the catch being transhipped to Japanese freezer vessels in the Great 
Australian Bight. 
 
The introduction of an ITQ based management plan in 1984 based on an Australian TAC of 14 500 
tonnes resulted in the redistribution of quota ownership.  In the late 1980s the Australian quota 
reductions to 5265 tonnes led to further restructuring.  From 1990 to 1994 approximately half the 
Australian quota was taken by Australian-Japan joint venture longliners.  With the termination of the 
joint venture arrangements in 1995 Australian catches again focused on the surface fishery with poling 
operations supplying the fresh chilled sashimi market and purse seiners providing SBT to farms. 
 
Since 1992 there has been progressive increase in the number of SBT taken under farming operations.  
In the 2000-01 season this component utilised over 98% of the Australian quota. 
 
7. 
Fisheries Monitoring 
There are a series of logbooks and associated catch records that are required by law to be completed by 
fishers and fish receivers and sent to AFMA for the purposes of monitoring, compliance and research.  
The type of form used is dependent on the type of method used to catch SBT in the fishery.  All of the 
data provided from Logbooks and Catch Disposal Records must be supplied to AFMA within specified 
time periods specific to each record.  Validation of this data is undertaken as a minimum on an annual 
basis through an audit process by AFMA compliance staff, and sometimes on a needs basis.  The 
monitoring arrangements in the SBT fishery continue to be reviewed and refined in order to improve 
monitoring and compliance. 
 
Catch Disposal Records 
Catch disposal records for SBT are for recording SBT taken by fishers for the purposes other than 
farming and are signed by the fishing concession holder and the first receiver immediately after unloading 
the catch.  Catch disposal records provide a means to verify logbook data. 
 
Australian Daily Fishing Log and Farm Transit Log 
A Logbook form is required to be completed by fishers when using pelagic longlining or when fishing 
with minor line methods.  In the purse seine fishery the Master of the catcher vessel (with quota 
assigned) is required to complete the Australian Purse Seine and Pole Daily Fishing Log – for farmed 
SBT only.  A specific permit called the Farm Transit Log is completed by the holder of the SBT carrier 
boat permit or representative, and provided to the monitoring company which undertakes the fish count 
when fish are transferred from tow cages to farm cages. 
 
Farm Disposal Record 
A specific process has been designed to obtain data to allow for research and monitoring from farming 
operations.  An independent company is contracted annually by AFMA to monitor the farming 
operations.  All mortalities that occur during the capture and towing operations must be recorded on the 
appropriate form and must be available for inspection if requested by an AFMA officer. 
 
When SBT are transferred from tow cages to the fish farms, a video record must be carried out by the 
AFMA contracted monitoring company.  The video recording is then used to undertake a count of the 
fish that are transferred into the fish farm.  This count of captured fish will be multiplied by the average 
fish weight (derived from a 40 fish sample) and decremented from quota using the Farm Disposal Record 
.  During the 1999-00, 2000-01 and 2001-02 season AFMA Compliance Officers were deployed on farm 
tow vessels to observe procedures and protocols. 
 
Observer Programmes  
Observer programmes for the purse seine and longline sectors will be implemented for the 2002-2003 
fishing season with the aim of achieving 10 percent coverage of catch and effort.  
 
Seasonal Area Restrictions 
To minimise the risk of non-quota take of SBT by longliners off New South Wales, access to the waters 
through which SBT migrate has been restricted to vessels holding SBT quota since 2000. 
 
8. 
Other Factors 
Import/Export Statistics 
The Trade Information Scheme (TIS) that records all exported Australian fish has been implemented and 
refined.  A TIS form is completed by an authorised signatory from the export-registered establishment 
that is the last to handle the consignment before the product leaves Australia and validated by a 
Government officer.  The form is used for both farmed and non-farmed SBT.  This program provides a 
complete record of SBT exports that can be compared with the Japanese Import Statistics. 
Markets 
More than 95% of Australia’s SBT catch is exported to Japan.

Review of Taiwan’s SBT Fishery of 2001/2002  
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Taiwan has traditionally been fishing for southern bluefin tuna (SBT) 
since 1970s.  The fish was caught partly by seasonal directed fishery and 
partly by albacore/bigeye fisheries as a by-catch.  Seasonal directed fishery 
was conducted mainly by longliners equipped with super cold freezers, fishing 
in two seasons, i.e. one from June to September and the other from October to 
February in the next year, in the waters around 35°S.  However no 
year-round directed fishery has yet been developed.  The annual catch in 
2001 was preliminary estimated to be 1,580 M.T.  Catch statistics for 2002 
are not available as fishing activities for the second season of the year is still 
going on at the time of preparation of this report. 
2. OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON EFFORT 
Regulatory Mesaures 
Taiwan has become a member of Extended Commission of CCSBT in 
2002, and agreed to national catch limit of 1,140 M.T.  About 75% of the 
annual catch was allocated to the seasonal directed fishery vessels while 25% 
to the by-catch vessels.  Each vessel is required to register with the tuna 
association as vessel either for directed SBT fishery or for SBT by-catch 
fishery for authorization by the government before catching SBT. 
In order to gather SBT catch information promptly and to manage the 
total SBT catch within the voluntary catch limit of SBT, every vessel that has 
caught SBT was required to report weekly it’s catches of SBT in weight and 
fishing location (Weekly Report) to the fishery authorities as from 1996.  
This system has been refined in 2002 to obtain more accurate catch 
information. Taiwan has undertaken issuing of SBT Statistical Document to 
export of SBT after June 2000 to comply with the requirement of TIS ( Trade 
Information Scheme) .  All vessels fishing for SBT are also required to equip 
with VMS (vessel monitoring system) for providing the vessel location to the 
  
 
2 
monitoring center since 2002.  Fishing in spawning area of SBT is prohibited 
and document of TIS will not be issued to any catch from such area to protect 
the spawning stock.   
3. CATCH AND EFFORT 
The annual catch in 2001 was preliminarily estimated to be 1,580 M.T.  
by 151 vessels. Among them, about 60-70% was made in the Southern and 
Central Indian Ocean. Accurate figure is still under verification. Catch 
statistics for 2002 are not available at this moment, as fishing activity for the 
second season of the year is still going on.  There are 125 vessels registered 
to catch SBT in 2002. This figure may change toward the end of fishing 
season.  
4. HISTORICAL CATCH AND EFFORT 
During the 1980s, annual catches of SBT were relatively small, less than 
250 M.T.  With the increase of fleet size of tuna longliners, development of 
deep sea longline fishery and expansion of fishing grounds, increase in annual 
catches was prominent.  Between 1989 and 1992, greater increase of SBT 
catch was observed, where drift net fishery accounted for about 1/4 of the 
catches.  With the prohibition of drift net fishery since 1993 in compliance 
with UNGA resolution, the catch of SBT returned to normal, fluctuating 
between 800 and 1,600 M.T during the 1990s (Table 1).  
5. ANNUAL FLEET SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION 
In 2001, there were 151 longline vessels catching SBT. However, due to the 
decrease of national catch limit, the number of vessels registered for catching SBT 
reduced to 125. Their fishing grounds were mainly in the waters of 20°S - 40°S, 
seasonally distributed in the southern and central Indian Ocean during June to 
September, and in the southern and western Indian Ocean extending to the 
eastern limit of the Atlantic Ocean during October to February of the 
following year.  
  
 
3 
6. HISTORICAL FLEET SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION 
SBT was caught only by longline fishery after 1992 in the three oceans, with 
more concentration in the Indian Ocean.  According to the weekly reports and 
trader’s information, about 140 deep sea longliners landed SBT during 1998-2001, 
and most of them were operating in the Indian Ocean.  
 
7. FISHERIES MONITORING 
Such efforts have been exerted for better understanding and monitoring the 
fishery, for example, the implementation of TIS to collect more updated and detailed 
catch information.  Since 2002, provision of daily records, including catch, position 
and discards, in the updated Weekly Report was required for obtaining the SBT 
statistical document.  As from April 2002, it is mandatory for the vessels that catch 
SBT to equip with VMS in order to monitor activities of the vessels. 
8. OTHER FACTORS 
Import/Export Statistics 
The trade Information Scheme that records all exported Taiwanese fish has been 
implemented. This program will provide a complete record of SBT exports that can be 
compared with the Japanese Import Statistics. 
Markets 
SBT is mainly exported to Japanese for its sashimi market.

Review of Southern Bluefin Tuna Fisheries of Japan in the 2002 Fishing Season 
(Provisional since the 2002 fishing season has not completed.) 
 
1.  Introduction 
(1) The total amount of catch of SBT for the 2002 fishing season ( 1 March 2002 - 28 February 
2003) was 5,693 tons at 30 September 2002. 
(2) Japanese distant-water tuna longline fishery has been facing a severe economic situation due 
to a fall in the price of tuna caused by a decline in demand for tuna because of the long 
recession in Japan and the continued high level of import of tuna. 
 
2. Operational Constraints on Effort 
(1) GOJ is managing the catch of SBT for each fishing season based on TAC and national 
allocations agreed by CCSBT. 
(2) Fishing operations for the 2002 fishing season have been started with a tentative catch limit 
of 6,065tons, since no agreement was reached for this season. 
(3) Further, GOJ is managing the fishing operations by introducing the time/area closure in 
order to protect the spawning grounds and juveniles. 
(4) The industry sets voluntary starting days for three sub-fishing areas (high seas area off 
Tasmania/Sydney, high seas area off Cape Town and Southern Indian Ocean), and limits the 
total number of vessels for each sub-fishing area. 
 
3. Catch and Effort (refer to Appendix 1) 
In the 2002 fishing season, the fishing operations in the high seas area off Tasmania/Sydney 
and off Cape Town have been closed with the catch of 1,960tons by 69 vessels and 3,308tons 
by 96 vessels ( 3 vessels within 99 vessels which had been selected for targeting SBT did not 
operate) , respectively. The operations in the Southern Indian Ocean are still undertaken. 
 
4. Historical Catch and Effort (refer to Appendix 1) 
(1) In the 1998 fishing season, GOJ took voluntary measures by setting a limit of 6,065 tons, 
same as the agreed amount of catch as the national allocation to Japan in 1997, in the absence 
of a decision on TAC by the Commission. The actual catch in the 1998 season was 6,038tons. 
(2) In the 1999 fishing season, GOJ originally took the same voluntary measures as for the 1998 
fishing season, in the absence of a decision on TAC by the Commission.  However, 
following the prescription of provisional measures by ITLOS concerning the experimental 
fishing conducted by Japan, the actual catch in the 1999 season was reduced by 711tons to 
5,354tons. 
(3) In the 2000 fishing season, GOJ set the voluntary catch limit of 4,578tons, 1,487tons less 
than 6,065tons which was the national allocation to Japan agreed in 1997. However, since the 
provisional measures prescribed by ITLOS was revoked in August 2000, the voluntary catch 
limit was changed to 6,065tons in September 2000. The actual catch in the 2000 season was 
6,027tons. 
(4) In the 2001 fishing season, fishing operations were started with a tentative catch limit of 
6,065tons and GOJ set the voluntary catch limit of 6,421tons after the consultation with the 
relevant Members. The actual catch in the 2001 season was 6,647ton. 
 
5. Annual Fleet Size and Distribution (refer to Appendix 1) 
The number of fishing vessels selected for targeting SBT in the 2002 fishing season was 227. 
The number of vessels on the high seas off Tasmania/Sydney was 69, the number of vessels on 
the high seas off Cape Town was 99 ( 3 of which did not operate), and the number of vessels in 
Southern Indian Ocean was 59. 
 
6. Historical Fleet Size and Distribution (refer to Appendix 1) 
(1) Until the end of the 1998 fishing season, 257 fishing vessels operated for each year. 
(2) In the 1999 fishing season, 227 fishing vessels ( 30 vessels less than the 1998 fishing 
seasons) operated, since Japan cut the number of distant-water tuna longliners based on the 
Plan of Action agreed by FAO. 
(3) In the 2000 fishing season, the number of vessels for SBT was reduced to 172 in accordance 
with the reduction of the catch limit based on the provisional measures prescribed by ITLOS. 
However, since the provisional measures were revoked, 199 vessels, 27 vessels more than the 
original, operated for SBT based on the increase of the catch limit in September. 
(4) In the 2001 fishing season, the number of vessels for SBT was restored to the 1999 fishing 
season level, which was 227. 
 
7. Fisheries Monitoring 
(1) GOJ issued a notification to the industry that SBT catch should be reported every 10days for 
the management of the catch limit. 
(2) GOJ took necessary measures to control and monitor the fishery, which include dispatching 
enforcement vessels to the fishing area, observers on board of operating vessels, as well as 
requirement for fishing vessels to install VMS on board vessels and to report a daily position 
to GOJ. 
(3) In the 2002 fishing season, 3 enforcement vessels were/will be dispatched to the fishing 
ground and the number of observers to monitor the operation on board were/will be 19. 
 
8. Others factors (refer to Appendix 2 for Japanese import of SBT) 
(1) From 1993 to 1998, the amount of SBT imported to Japan had significantly increased. Since 
1998, the amount of SBT import has been stable at around just over 10,000tons (product 
weight). 
(2) The amount of import of SBT in 2001 was 10,926tons (product weight).  Import from the 
biggest 5 exporting country/entities (1: Australia, 2: Taiwan, 3: Republic of Korea, 4: New 
Zealand, 5: Indonesia) accounts for 99.5% of the total. 
(3) Import from Australia, the biggest exporting country/area of SBT to Japan has increased its 
export of SBT steadily, reaching 8,186tons (product weight) in 2001.  This amount of SBT 
accounts for 74.9% of the total import of SBT to Japan.

Review of New Zealand SBT Fisheries for the 9th Annual CCSBT Meeting 
 
 
 
1.  Introduction 
Three fishing methods are used to target SBT in the EEZ with most fishing by surface longline 
(about 96%) and the remainder by trolling and handlining. The domestic fishery is composed of a 
wide range of vessel types including a variable number of small owner-operated boats and 4–5 
low temperature Japanese distant water longliners chartered by a New Zealand company. Both the 
chartered vessels and the New Zealand owner-operated vessels fish competitively against New 
Zealand’s SBT catch allocation. 
 
Fishing for SBT in 2000/01 was primarily conducted off the west coast of the South Island and 
along the east coast of the North Island north of 42º S. For the 2000/01 fishing season, New 
Zealand reduced its national allocation from 4290 t to 395 t to compensate for the domestic 
fishery over catch in 1999/00. New Zealand closed the fishery in late June when it forecast that 
the fishery would reach 395 t. However, when all landings were tallied the actual catch in 2000/01 
was 362 t, an under catch of 33 t. In 2001/02 SBT catches exceeded our national allocation of  
420 t. with landings post-closure of the season resulting in a total annual catch of 452 t, an over 
catch of 32 t.  
 
2.  Operational Constraints on Effort 
Voluntary measures 
Since 1994 the New Zealand fishing industry has implemented voluntary measures with respect to 
longline fishing that are detailed in a “Code of Practice”. Specific measures include gear 
specifications, environmental standards, operational practices and closed areas. The intent of the 
measures is to minimize: 
• 
bycatch (eg of seabirds and marine mammals); 
• 
catch of SBT smaller than 20 kg; 
• 
impacts on other domestic tuna fisheries, and 
• 
gear conflict among SBT longline vessels. 
Other measures that are used but not part of the “Code of Practice” include catch limits by area, 
changing areas when bird bycatch reaches a specific level, using multiple “tori” lines and longer 
lines than specified in regulations, night-setting, and the use of pneumatic “bird-scaring” cannons. 
 
Regulatory measures 
New Zealand continues to impose the previously agreed national catch limit of 420 tonnes (whole 
weight). This catch limit is a competitive limit among all license holders. Regulations specify the 
annual catch limit and make it an offence to take SBT once the catch limit has been reached. The 
catch limit applies within and outside New Zealand fisheries waters for the “fishing year” which 
extends from 1 October to 30 September. In the few years when the catch limit has been 
exceeded, it has been reduced in the following year by an equivalent amount. 
 
Until midway through the 2000–01 fishing season the SBT quota has applied to the catch of both 
southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) and Pacific bluefin tunas (formerly Thunnus thynnus, 
now recognized as Thunnus orientalis). This additional quota restriction was removed late in the 
2000/01 SBT season when it was demonstrated that Pacific bluefin could be readily distinguished 
from SBT in catches based on morphological characteristics. SBT landings reported prior to June 
2001 did not distinguish between the two species and hence these and earlier landings are a 
mixture of the two species. 
 
Attachment 9-4

3.  Catch and Effort 
Table 1 gives the estimated SBT catch by gear type since 1990 and clearly shows that since this 
time the New Zealand SBT fishery has essentially been a longline fishery. Longline effort now 
dominates the fishery and catches by handline and trolling are negligible components of the New 
Zealand SBT fishery. Total SBT catches are summarised by calendar year and fishing year (1 
October to 30 September) in Table 2. Figure 1 shows the effort trend (in millions of hooks) for the 
longline fishery from 1989 to 2001, the most recent complete year of processed data.  It is clear 
from this figure that the increase in effort is attributable to the growing number of New Zealand 
owned and operated longliners primarily targeting bigeye but also catching SBT as a bycatch. The 
total number of longline hooks set each year is now nearly 10 million, sets targeting SBT account 
for about 20% of all longline effort. 
 
4.  Historical Catch and Effort 
Figure 2 shows the trend in SBT nominal CPUE since 1980 by fleet. The foreign licensed fleet 
CPUE shows a decline throughout the period fished except in 1990 and 1995, the last year when 
the fleet fished in the EEZ. CPUE for the chartered fleet (beginning in 1989) and the domestic 
owner-operator fleet (beginning in 1991) are highly variable. Nominal CPUE throughout the 
1990s is not regarded as a very good indicator of abundance because of changes in operational 
practices and areas fished by each fleet. 
 
5.  Annual Fleet Size and Distribution 
The New Zealand longline fleet has broadened its area of operation and now fishes most areas of 
the east and west coasts of both the North and South Islands. The total number of longliners 
fishing in 2001 was 132 vessels, over 70% of which were small longliners (< 50 GRT).  
 
SBT target fishing by longline primarily occurs off the west coast of the South Island and along 
the east coast of the North Island. SBT also comprises a significant bycatch in the bigeye target 
fishery in the Bay of Plenty. Figure 3 shows the position of all longline sets targeting SBT in 
2000/01 (Charter and owner-operator vessels combined). 
 
6.  Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
The New Zealand SBT fishery began off the west coast of the South Island as a winter small boat 
handline and troll fishery in the early 1980s.  These methods have comprised only a minor 
component of the fishery since 1990.  During the 1980s to mid-1990s most longlining was 
conducted by foreign licensed longliners from Japan. However, declining catch rates, shortened 
seasons of availability and reports of increased operating costs in the EEZ resulted in the foreign 
licensed fleet ceasing operations in 1995. Domestic longlining began in 1991 and has steadily 
increased up to at least 2001. The change in vessel numbers and in vessel size composition is 
shown in figure 4. 
 
7. Fisheries Monitoring 
Observer coverage 
Observer coverage has been 100% in the charter fleet for several years. However, the small size 
of domestic owned and operated vessels and short trips has made it difficult for the Ministry of 
Fisheries (MFish) to realise the 10% target for observer coverage in this fleet.  As a consequence, 
observer coverage has typically been low. However, a target of 10% observer coverage for this 
fleet and 100% coverage for the charter fleet has been agreed. Coverage during the 2000/01 
fishing year resulted in 42 % of all longline hooks set targeting SBT observed (96% of hooks in 
the Charter fleet and 15% of domestic owner-operator vessels. Realignment of MFish observer 
allocation should result in continued improvements in coverage of domestic owned and operated 
longline vessels. Observer coverage on vessels using handline or trolling is not planned because 
the contribution of these methods to the total catch is minor. 
 
3
RTMP coverage 
MFish operates an in-season catch monitoring system for SBT. This system requires that on-shore 
processing companies and freezer vessels (including all of the chartered fleet) to report their catch 
by e-mail or fax during the season to MFish. Weekly reporting is required once 25% of the catch 
allocation is reached and daily reporting is required when 50% of the catch allocation has been 
reached. Reports are collated and analysed by MFish with the season being closed as close as 
possible to reaching our national allocation. All SBT permit holders are then notified that the 
season is closed and that it would be an offence to take southern bluefin tuna for the remainder of 
the fishing year.  
Biological information 
Observers from the MFish Scientific Observer Programme are responsible for collecting 
biological data on SBT and bycatch data for catch characterisation. In 2000/01, otoliths were 
collected from 777 SBT and observers recovered five tags (all CSIRO tags, 1 SBT injected with 
SrCl). Otoliths are stored at NIWA and tag recovery data were provided to the tagging agency. 
Length, weight (both processed and whole weights) and sex are recorded regularly for SBT and 
all major fish bycatch species. In total stomach contents were collected from over 750 SBT and 
nearly 3000 SBT were measured. 
 
8. Other Factors 
Import/export statistics 
Statistics on the export of SBT are compiled by Customs and summarized by the Department of 
Statistics. Export statistics are further summarized by the New Zealand Seafood Industry Council 
and maintained as a database for economic evaluations of New Zealand fisheries. 
Markets 
The only market for SBT caught in the EEZ is the Japanese sashimi market and all fish of suitable 
quality are exported. Domestic consumption is negligible. 
Mitigation 
New Zealand regulations specify that all tuna longline vessels shall use seabird-scaring devices 
(“tori-lines”). The minimum standard for “tori lines”, is the same as specified by CCAMLR. The 
domestic fishing industry has a voluntary code of practice advocating night setting for all tuna 
longlining and for the large tuna longline vessels a limit on total incidental mortality of “at risk” 
seabirds has been set. 
Recreational and Indigenous Catches of SBT 
Recreational fishing for SBT is very limited and catches are insignificant. There are no estimates 
of SBT catches by Maori beyond those comprising commercial catch statistics.

           Korean SBT Fisheries in the Indian Ocean

Introduction 
 
   Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) fishery is the most recently developed tuna 
fishery by Korean distant-water fishing industry since the early 1990s. The SBT 
catch made by Korean fleet reached a maximum in 1998, followed by 
continuous decrease until recent years. This was mainly due to the voluntary 
regulation of fleet size by Korean fishing companies to implement the resolution 
adopted by CCSBT. However, the shift of Korean longliners from the Indian to 
the Pacific Ocean aiming to higher profit from fishery also contributed to the 
decrease in catch of this species.  
 
Catch and Effort 
 
Fishing season of Korean SBT longline fishery usually starts in March and 
ends by November or December. Thus, fisheries statistics are collected and 
reported for a calendar year. In the first half of fishing season from March to July 
or August, Korean longliners are fishing in the high seas of the western Indian 
Ocean off South Africa, with occasional expanded operation to the southeastern 
Atlantic, while in the second half they move to the eastern Indian Ocean off the 
western Australia. This fishing pattern and fishing grounds have rarely been 
changed for the past 10 years of fishing history for SBT except for 1991, the 
first year of SBT fishing during which Korean longliners fished in Australian 
waters. 
 
In 2001, 10 out of 16 registered longliners made a catch of 735 mt SBT in the 
usual fishing area, showing a decrease by about 25% from 2000 figure. During 
2000 - 2001, more catches were taken from the eastern fishing ground than 
from the western area.  
 
Nominal CPUE 
 
CPUE of Korean longline fishery for SBT has shown a decreasing trend  from 
a peak at 8.4 fish/1,000 hooks in 1994. However, CPUE appeared to be more 
or less stable between 2.3 and 4.1 fish/1,000 hooks in recent years. It was 
noted from the monthly CPUE analyses that catch efficiency is higher from the 
western fishing ground, 2.7-5.6 fish/1,000 hooks than the eastern ground, 1.8-
2.8 fish/1,000 hooks.  
 
Size composition 
 
Fishermen on board have routinely collected size of SBT but the data should 
be used with caution due to relatively small sample size and no validation 
procedure.  
Size of SBT caught by Korean longliners during the past 5 years ranges from 
100 to 210cm FL with the average of 153cm and shows that SBT caught in the 
eastern area were slightly bigger than those in the western area. 
 
Fleet size and distribution 
 
Korean SBT fishery commenced in 1991 with a few longliners shifted from 
tropical waters where they targeted bigeye and yellowfin. Thus, in the early 
years of this fishery, SBT did not attract Korean fishing industry, but because of 
higher market price, from 1995 onward number of longliners rapidly increased 
to reach a maximum fleet size of 19 longliners in 1998. However, by the 
voluntary regulation of fleet size among fishing industries, annual fleet size for 
SBT fishery never exceeded 16 registered number since then which resulted in 
less catch than allocated quota of 1,140 mt in 2001.    
  
Other relevant information 
 
Observer program 
Korean government initiated fisheries observer program in 2002 to monitor its 
distant water fisheries including those for tunas and to meet the requirements of 
regional fisheries bodies. At the initial stage, the size of observer program will 
be fairly small to cover only for the fisheries to be urgently implemented such as 
SBT longline fishery in CCSBT Convention Area but will be gradually developed 
to a bigger scale to cover all required areas of fisheries.   
 
Data Collection System 
   Two systems have been maintained for the collection of Korean tuna 
fisheries data. The first system has been operated by the Korean Deep-Sea 
Fisheries Association to collect total catch by species.  All Korean distant water 
fishing vessels report their catch records in terms of weight by species to their 
companies once a week or at 10-day intervals. The Association compiles the 
data by month and by FAO fishing area to submit to the Ministry of Maritime 
Affairs and Fisheries for the final review and publication.  The catch statistics 
have been published for official use annually by both the Association and the 
Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries.  
The second data collection system is to sample catch and effort data based 
on the logbooks. This system was lawful in 1977 by the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Fisheries. According to this domestic regulation, distant-water fishing 
vessels have to submit the reports of their fishing operations within 30 days 
(home-based) or 60 days (foreign-based) after completion of their operations to 
the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI).

TERMS OF REFERENCE: 
REVIEW OF MONITORING PROGRAM OF INDONESIAN SBT CATCH 
 
 
For the purpose of obtaining reliable and comprehensive information on the Indonesian 
SBT fishery for stock assessment analysis and the recommendation of a TAC, the 
CCSBT requires the monitoring arrangements and methodologies used for estimating 
the Indonesian SBT catch to be reviewed. The CCSBT also seeks guidance on the 
structure / profile of an appropriate fishery monitoring program which will provide data 
to enable a better understanding of the Indonesian fishing practice in terms of SBT 
exploitation.  
 
Review of Existing Catch Monitoring Systems 
The review will: 
• Assess the systems and methodologies currently used to provide data to the 
CCSBT on the estimated total catch of SBT by Indonesia.  
• Where appropriate, provide recommendations for improving the current systems 
and methodologies used to monitor Indonesian SBT catch.  
• Where necessary, make recommendations on measures to coordinate CCSBT and 
IOTC monitoring programs to maximize compatibility between the IOTC and 
CCSBT programs. 
• Review available data on SBT exports from Indonesia and provide comment on 
possible sources of difference between Indonesian export data and exports 
documented by the TIS. 
• Provide an estimate of cost for any proposed improvements or additional 
monitoring. 
 
Review Panel 
The review panel should include: 
• Existing participants in the current Indonesian monitoring program (CSIRO, 
RIMF, DGCF). 
• Representatives of members of the Extended Commission. 
• A representative of the IOTC Secretariat. 
• Members of the CCSBT Advisory Panel.

Attachment 15 
 
Data Security Policy of the CCSBT Secretariat 
 
The Secretariat seeks to operate a security and confidentiality policy that gives 
providers of SBT data with sufficient confidence for them to provide confidential data 
to the Secretariat. 
 
The Secretariat will abide by the following data security policy: 
 
(a) Electronic Data 
• Access to the Secretariat’s computer system will be restricted to valid users 
(primarily staff of the Secretariat1).  Users’ of the computer system will only 
be provided with the level of access appropriate to the work that they are 
conducting for the Secretariat.  The Database Manager will control the level of 
access that is allocated to individuals. 
• Access to the Secretariat’s computers will require logging on with a valid user-
name and password.  Passwords of users will be changed every 60 days. 
• The Secretariat’s computers will have screen savers with password protection. 
Screen savers will have a “wait” time of less than 10 minutes. 
• Access to the Secretariat’s database will require a valid username and 
password.  Direct access to the database will not be available via the internet. 
• Any confidential data that is not held on the database (e.g. data files received 
by the Secretariat prior to being loaded onto the database) will either be stored 
in a password protected file, or on an encrypted section of the hard disk that 
requires a password to be accessed. 
• Transmission of confidential data via electronic means (e.g. e-mail, disk, CD, 
FTP) will always use password protected files (e.g. password protected Excel 
and Zip files), or an e-mail encryption system. 
• Backups of CCSBT data (e.g. tapes, disks) will be password protected and/or 
be stored in an external secure environment.  
The above rules are designed to keep CCSBT data confidential, even in the event that 
one of the Secretariat’s computers is stolen.  A thief will not be able to access the data 
without the correct passwords to those areas in which the data are stored.  In addition, 
the use of a screen saver with password protection ensures that temporary absence of 
a Secretariat staff member while “logged-on”, will not allow an unauthorised person 
to “sneak-in” and view the data. 
 
(b) Physical Data 
• The Secretariat’s office is locked when unattended and is monitored by an 
electronic security system when the building is closed (e.g. in the evenings). 
• Physical data (e.g. paper records) of a confidential nature will be kept within 
the Secretariat’s office, or in the company of a Secretariat staff member. 
• Physical data that are deemed to be highly confidential will be stored in filing 
cabinets and cupboards that are locked when the office is unattended. 
• Physical copies of electronic data provided to the Secretariat (e.g. CD’s) will 
be destroyed or returned to the supplier of the data. 
                                                
1 If people other than Secretariat staff require access to the computer system, they would not, as a general rule, 
have access to confidential data on the system.  Access to data by such people will be treated the same as a release 
of data and such access will therefore be governed by the Confidentiality Policy. 
Attachment 16 
 
Confidentiality Policy for the CCSBT Central Database 
 
This is the policy for releasing data from the CCSBT Central Database.  This policy 
has no influence on the data that should be provided to the database by members of 
the Extended Commission and other parties. 
 
The use of the word “data” in this policy refers to both raw and aggregated data. 
 
Data provided for the CCSBT database will be treated confidentially and will not be 
released by the Secretariat except where members of the Extended Commission 
approve the specific data release on a case by case basis. 
 
Consensus at SAG/ESC meetings and subsequent approval by the Extended 
Commission is sufficient approval for release of specific data to members of the 
Extended Commission for the purpose of routine data exchange for the stock 
assessment and management procedure.  This approval will apply until the Extended 
Commission revises the data confidentiality policy. Release of other data requires case 
by case approval from an exchange of correspondence (including e-mails) between 
Extended Commission member’s nominated contacts. 
 
When providing approval to release specific data, members of the Extended 
Commission can specify that the particular data does not require their re-approval for 
future releases by the Secretariat.  In these situations, members of the Extended 
Commission must also specify the groups of people (e.g. public, Extended 
Commission members) to whom the Secretariat may release the data without 
requiring case by case re-approval.  The Secretariat will maintain a list of data sets 
(and associated groups of people) that are approved for release without requiring case 
by case re-approval.  The list will be provided to members of the Extended 
Commission and members of the Extended Commission have the right to revise the 
approvals that they have given.

Australia’s Closing Statement – CCSBT 9 
 
 
Thank you Chair for your patience and guidance.  Thank you interpreters for your 
understanding and assistance.  Secretariat, thank you for your support. 
 
Once again, we find ourselves at an impasse.  The impasse, as usual, results from a 
request by Japan for extra fish above its previous allocation. 
 
It is essential that society and its institutions have rules, and that these are obeyed by 
Members.  This is no different for international fisheries commissions. 
 
This is a consensus based commission and there is no room for unilateral action. 
 
I have two interesting press articles concerning Japanese fisheries.  The first one I 
shared with some of you yesterday. 
 
Japanese industry as I noted yesterday has agreed to help China build up its fishing 
capacity I am told for Bigeye tuna for 30,000 tonnes.  I note that in the Indian Ocean 
this fish is currently being fish at 60,000 tonnes above MSY (Attachment A). 
 
In another article quoting the JFA it says  … “Japan must build on the image of a 
responsible tuna fishing nation and do its utmost to safeguard this valuable, fragile, 
highly migratory resource to ensure sustainability for the future, said the Agency.”  
(World Fishing  September 2002) (Attachment B).  There is a responsibility to make 
this image a reality. 
 
I have listened this week to Japanese comments about dioxins and about the safety and 
quality of our fish.  I have responded accordingly and note that there are well 
documented obligations relating to the international trade and obligations that countries 
must adhere to.  Australia will meet these obligations and expects other countries to do 
the same. 
 
We want the Commission to function to its full potential. 
 
Australia’s position is clear.  Countries must be responsible and fish legally.  They must 
restrain their catches to previously agree national allocation levels.  Australia agrees to 
do this and calls on all responsible members to restrain their catch to the previous 
agreed levels.  Australia will regard any catch above these levels by any member, in any 
year, as over catch that must be repaid.  This is base on clear advice from the Scientific 
Committee.  Those who have over-caught in 2001 and 2002 must pay this back during 
2002-003 season.  As I have noted there are no extra fish.  Australia will make every 
effort to work with responsible members to further reduce the catch of non members in 
an effort to help the fishery recover. 
 
In 2001 Australia and Japan negotiated what we felt was in good faith to finalise the 
settlement from the dispute by agreeing an arrangement on the 711 tonnes. 
 
The parties also agreed to the attachment to the CCSBT an eminent group of external 
scientists and chairs to progress the work of the CCSBT.  They have been particularly 
successful in progressing the science of SBT. 
 
As managers we have received the best, unbiased guidance we have had on the state of 
the SBT stock and what to do about it this week.  It is time we listened to what we are 
being told.  
 
We have agreed to a stock assessment process for 2004 to determine the best way 
forward for this fishery. 
 
There are no spare fish.  This fishery is being fished, at best, at replacement yield and 
with only a 50-50 chance that this will improve. 
 
This Commission has objectives to conserve and utilise the stock and the conservation 
goal is to recover the spawning stock biomass to 1980 levels by 2020.  This stands 
unless there is an agreement to change it. 
 
CCSBT 1 established clear arrangements for the allocation of any future catch increases 
in this fishery.  These arrangements are the only ones in place.  They are clear and must 
be respected. 
 
This Commission by its convention and through its meetings over the years has 
established rules and arrangements that must be respected by all members. 
 
Australia will not compromise on ambiguous or poorly worded text.  To us, an 
agreement should be clearly understood by all parties. 
 
This must be a responsible and transparent Commission, not one dogged by ambiguity 
and unwarranted argument and distrust. 
 
To Taiwan and Korea, thank you for your contributions. 
 
To South Africa, I apologise that we cannot do more for you at this point, however, I 
look forward to your continued engagement. 
 
Once again we leave CCSBT with a sense of emptiness.  One can only hope that one 
day members will see a common light and move forward together.

Tuna talks held between Japan and China 
 
 
Japan (August 29, 2002) - On 21 August, Japan and China held private level tuna 
talks in Beijing to discuss, among other things, China’s bid for membership of the 
Organisation for the Promotion of Responsible Tuna Fisheries (OPRT), which was 
established in December 2000. 
 
Heading Japan’s delegation was Mr Ueda, chairman of the Federation of Japan 
Skipjack and Tuna Fisheries Cooperatives - a key OPRT supporter -, who detailed 
the resolution adopted by the deep-sea tuna longliner fishery cooperatives held on 
1 August in Tokyo when members of the cooperatives asked the Japanese 
government to ban imports of tuna from vessels that don’t appear on OPRT’s “white 
list”, which contains the names of all vessels that comply with international tuna 
regulations. 
 
Japan said the Chinese industry should respect and understand this resolution and 
strongly recommended membership of OPRT, which could happen this year, 
according to Mr Ueda, who said China seemed willing to accept the white list. 
 
China asked for access to Japanese vessels to help train fishermen and Japan 
conceded, agreeing to help develop China’s tuna industry and market, which aims 
to consume 30,000 tonnes of tuna a year, caught by white list and not flag of 
convenience vessels. Japan also agreed to help China sell its tuna on the Japanese 
market. 
 
The possibility of joint ventures was also mentioned, said Mr Ueda. Some Japanese 
ship owners are interested in joint ventures, but the Japanese authorities say there 
have to be some guidelines, such as the use of OPRT vessels only.

New regulations for tuna fishery 
 
 
Japan’s Atlantic Ocean tuna fishery for this year is underway and with the opening of 
the season on August 1, the Fisheries Agency announced some new regulations 
regarding deep-sea and skipjack catches that will run through July 2003. 
 
One of the main changes affects catch limits.  Bluefin catches have been set at 300 
tonnes, oriental bluefin at 2,700 tonnes, bigeye at 32,539 tonnes, swordfish at 2,964 
tonnes, white marlin at 37 tonnes and Atlantic blue marlin at 840 tonnes. 
 
The Fisheries Agency has stipulated that all northern swordfish catches, whether the 
fish is dead or alive, must be released back into the water, but an accurate record kept of 
all releases.  This data must be submitted to the Agency for evaluation.  There are also 
changes to transhipment system.  This season, those vessels wishing to tranship bluefin, 
bigeye, yellowfin, swordfish, white marlin and Atlantic blue marlin must give 10 days 
notice to the authorities.  Bluefin weight certificates have changed too.  This season, the 
weight certificates of all bluefin caught in the Atlantic, including landings by longliners 
without transport vessel, must be submitted no more than 10 days after landing. 
 
Last season, only landings made via transport vessels had to submit a weight certificate.  
The Fisheries Agency has issued strong warnings to fishermen indicating that any 
violation of the regulations will be severely punished. 
 
Japan must build on the image of a responsible tuna fisheries nation and do its utmost to 
safeguard this valuable, fragile, highly migratory resource to ensure sustainability for 
the future, said the Agency.

Closing Remarks 
Canberra October 15-18 2002 
Taiwan 
 
On behalf of the delegation of Taiwan, I would like to express my sincere gratitude and 
compliment to the excellent jobs performed by the Chair and the Secretariat. I am also 
grateful for the Australian Government in providing the members with such an elegant 
meeting venue and other needed logistics. 
 
As a new member at the Extended Commission, we have seen a fruitful outcome of this 
meeting. Despite the different view points on certain issues as put on the agenda, there 
have been numerous positive comments, suggestions, and contributions among 
members. 
 
In particular, we deeply cherish the opportunity of observing the functions of the 
meeting procedures, and, through that, we and other members are able to contribute 
ourselves even more to the conservation and optimal utilization of the SBT. Above all, 
the experiences we have gained here have led to our being a more constructive role in 
the CCSBT in terms of privilege and obligation.  
 
Once again, we thank you very much and look forward to further co-operations and 
efforts among members in reaching the goals of CCSBT in the future. 
 
Thank you. 
Attachment 20-3 
 
 
Statement by Japan at the closing of the Extended Commission of CCSBT 
 
 
I would like to make the following statement at the closing of the 2002 annual meeting 
of the CCSBT Extended Commission. 
 
The current meeting was held for the first time as the Extended Commission following 
the membership of Fishing Entity of Taiwan. However, I regret that no agreement was 
reached on TAC and national allocations despite the fact that Japan made every possible 
effort by presenting constructive proposals through the course of discussions. Japan, 
respecting the recommendations by the Scientific Committee and in accordance with the 
objective of the CCSBT Convention, which is to ensure conservation and optimum 
utilisation of southern bluefin tuna, will make the utmost effort to control its catch in the 
2003 fishing season at the recent levels. At the same time, Japan considers it necessary 
to reflect any surplus, derived from the undertaking on the Indonesian catch decided at 
this annual meeting, and progress made so far made for on the non-member issue, to the 
catch allocation of each member fairly for the 2002 and 2003 fishing seasons. As for the 
unintentional excess of catch of the voluntary catch limit in the 2001 fishing season, 
Japan will take responsible measures by reducing the catch in the following fishing 
seasons by the exceeded amount of catch. 
 
Concerning the initiative by the Japanese fishing industry in China, which Australia 
referred to, the industry is trying to help China to develop the domestic market for tuna 
in China but not fishing operations. Therefore, I can not accept the mistaken accusation 
by Australia based on the wrong information. Japan has made series of actions 
necessary to ensure the appropriate management of the world tuna stocks through 
cutting its large scale tuna longline fleet by 20% and making efforts to eliminate IUU 
vessels. In this sense, I strongly object to the accusation by Australia on the Japanese 
efforts. 
 
Japan is prepared to continue its utmost effort to improve the function of CCSBT 
through promotion of the scientific research, and development of the management 
procedure. Last year Korea acceded to the Convention, and Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
has become the member of the Extended Commission this year. Japan is renewed its 
willingness to establish a new regime to ensure effective operations of CCSBT through 
cooperation among the members. 
 
Lastly, I would like to take the opportunity to present my gratitude to the excellent work 
by Chairman, staff of the Secretary and interpreters. 
 
Thank you. 
 
Attachment 20-4 
 
New Zealand Closing Statement 
 
 
We are very concerned that in the absence of an agreed TAC and national allocation, we 
will put the resource we have agreed to manage at risk. This is contrary to our 
obligations under UNCLOS and the responsibilities we have accepted under this 
Convention.  
 
We sincerely hope that in the absence of an agreed TAC and national allocation, the 
members of the Extended Commission will act consistently with the advice that has 
been provided by the Scientific Committee and maintain catches at previously agreed 
levels. To do otherwise would not be responsible. Consequently New Zealand will, on a 
voluntary basis, maintain its catch at previously agreed levels.  
 
We would like to remind delegates that in the event of an agreed increase in the TAC, 
the Commission agreed on an allocation formula at CCSBT1. Under this formula New 
Zealand would first move to 450 tonnes. As a second step, New Zealand’s allocation 
would move to 1,000 tonnes and Australia will move to parity with Japan.  
 
During the course of this meeting, we did achieve some progress towards agreement on 
a TAC and national allocation. Unfortunately, we were not successful. In our role as 
Chair for the following meetings, we will stand ready to use the good offices of the 
Chair to achieve a successful outcome.  
 Attachment 20-5 
 
 
 Closing Remarks 
Republic of Korea 
  
Korea appreciates again the government of Australia for hosting the ninth 
CCSBT meeting.  It also appreciates the Chair and the Secretariat staff for their 
excellent support and patience throughout this meeting. 
  
Korea feels that there are many conflicts among members.  Therefore, we need 
an innovative approach that is totally different from our current paradigm so that 
CCSBT members can continually cooperate for the conservation of southern 
bluefin tuna. 
  
Accordingly, Korea, attending as a full Member for the first time, was happy to 
work with all distinguished delegates regardless of the meeting’s 
outcome.  Korea especially appreciates the presence of South Africa throughout 
the meeting.  I hope to see you again in New Zealand. 
  
Thanks.
