Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
10. The Chair advised that Mr Morison’s term as Chair of the ERSWG comes to an 
end after this meeting. Mr Morison has Chaired the ERSWG since 2011 and on 
behalf of all the Members, the Chair thanked Sandy warmly for his substantial 
efforts as ERSWG Chair during this period. 
11. The Report from the Secretariat was provided to the meeting as paper CCSBT-
EC/2210/04 and was considered during the pre-meeting discussion process. The 
report contained one item for consideration by the EC, which is the process for 
selection of a new Chair for the ERSWG. 
12. The meeting agreed the process for recruitment of a new Chair for the ERSWG, 
which is shown at Attachment 6. 
13. The meeting noted the activities of the Secretariat as reported with appreciation. 
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
14. The Chair advised that the Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee 
(FAC) was announced intersessionally in Circular #2022/044. The Chair thanked 
Mr Neil Hughes for agreeing to Chair the FAC. It was also noted that the FAC 
has already commenced its work. 
15. The Executive Secretary provided a brief presentation of the draft revised budget 
for 2022 (CCSBT-EC/2210/05), the proposed budget for 2023 and the indicative 
budget for 2024 - 2025 (CCSBT-EC/2210/06).     
16. For the revised 2022 budget, the Executive Secretary noted that: 
• With the exception of Korea, all Members have paid their 2022 contributions 
to the CCSBT in full. The draft revised budget for 2022 assumes that Korea’s 
outstanding payment of approximately 25% of its contribution will be made 
during 2023;  
• The income for 2022 was about $177,000 higher than expected due mainly to 
a rollover of funds from 5 projects in 2021;  
• The total expenditure for 2022 is forecast to be approximately $470,000 
lower than the amount approved for 2022;   
• Savings are forecast across all seven expenditure areas of the budget;  
• Cancellation of physical meetings and travel, due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, is the primary reason for the reduced expenditure; and 
• The draft revised budget provides a carry-forward of $633,322 from 2022 to 
2023. 
 
17. For the 2023 draft budget and 2024 - 2025 indicative budgets, the Executive 
Secretary noted that: 
• The budgets include the funding required for the CCSBT’s usual business, 
including the Extended Scientific Committee’s (ESC) three-year workplan; 
• The budget assumes that all the main meetings in 2023 will proceed as 
physical meetings; 
• As discussed last year, current Member contribution levels are not sufficient 
to cover the current annual running costs of the CCSBT. The paper proposes 
that Member contributions for 2023 be increased by 3.5% over that of 2022, 
and, if expenditure cannot be reduced, that contributions be increased by a 
further 5% each year from 2024-2028; 
• If the current high inflation rate continues, the proposed increases in 
contributions are unlikely to be sufficient to cover the CCSBT's running 
costs; and 
• The budget paper identifies new expenditure items for 2023 that have yet to 
be approved. Some of these may be potential areas for cost savings. 
18. Detailed consideration of the two budget papers was referred to the FAC. 
19. The FAC was convened to consider: 
• The revised budget for 2022; 
• The proposed budget for 2023 including the nature of the proposed SFMWG 
and ERS meetings; and  
• The indicative budget for 2024 - 2025. 
20. Australia advised that it will contribute $10,000 to the 2023 project to update 
estimates of unaccounted fishing mortality (UAM). Members expressed 
appreciation for Australia’s generosity. Members expressed similar appreciation 
for Korea’s generous contribution towards the cost of hosting in 2023. 
21. The Chair requested that the FAC resolve differences in views regarding the 
format of the SFMWG meeting (in-person or virtual) and the number and format 
of ERS technical meetings. The FAC was also asked to consider Indonesia’s 
proposal for a Meeting Participation Fund. 
 
3.1. Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
22. The EC thanked the FAC Chair and the FAC for its hard work. 
23. The EC adopted the report of the FAC and all its recommendations, noting the 
revised 2022 budget (Annex A), approving the budget for 2023 (Annex B), 
noting the indicative budgets for 2024-2025 (Annex B), and adopting The 
Resolution on the establishment of a Meeting Participation Fund (MPF) for 
developing States of CCSBT Members, which is provided at Attachment 7. 
24. The full report of the FAC is provided at Attachment 8.  Important points 
include that: 
• The overall financial situation is that Member contributions are not sufficient 
to cover the annual running costs of the CCSBT. Therefore, a 3.5% increase 
in membership contributions for 2023 and approximately 5% increase per 
 
year between 2024 to 2028, together with the Contributions Stabilisation 
Fund and the remaining savings put aside in 2016 was considered necessary 
to reach a contribution level that would cover the annual running costs of the 
CCSBT. 
• Australia offered to make a voluntary contribution ($10,000) to fund half of 
the proposed update of NCNM estimates of unaccounted fishing mortality. 
• The FAC supported the establishment of a Meeting Participation Fund 
(MPF) from 2023 and recommended $50,000 be initially drawn from 
CCSBT funds to establish it, with ongoing funding for future years to come 
from either the CCSBT budget, or voluntary Member contributions, up to the 
total fund amount of $50,000.  The FAC recommended that the MPF provide 
support for attendance of technical meetings and not regular CCSBT 
meetings such as EC, CC, and ESC. 
25. FAC members expressed concern about the likely level of future contribution 
increases, noting these were not sustainable and recommended that the EC 
explore additional sources of income for the CCSBT and make efforts to reduce 
current levels of expenditure. 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries and ERS Interactions 
26. The Chair noted the deliberations of the CC on Members’ National Reports and 
invited Members to ask any questions regarding Members’ National Reports 
additional to those already raised at the Seventeenth Meeting of the Compliance 
Committee (CC 17).  
27. No additional questions were asked in relation to Members’ National Reports. 
 
4.1. Reports on Members’ projects 
28. The Chair invited Australia to provide an oral update on progress with trials for 
automated stereo-video. 
29. Australia explained that during 2021, it ran an international tender process after 
proactively contacting known recognised stereo-video providers. The preferred 
provider identified as part of this tender process has previous experience with 
stereo video in other RFMOs. The trial did not take place as planned because of 
the global pandemic and the travel restrictions in place prevented the provider 
from sending experts to Australia. Australian officials have been working 
remotely with the chosen provider since. Borders in Australia are now opened, 
which will allow the provider to begin field work in the January to March 2023 
period with the field work component scheduled for completion in January -
March 2024. 
30. New Zealand thanked Australia for its update and requested additional detail to 
better understand the difference between the work taking place in 2023 and 
2024.  New Zealand also queried what, if any, additional work may be necessary 
beyond this project before stereo-video can be successfully implemented. 
31. Australia clarified that the first phase is to operationally test the accuracy of the 
equipment in Port Lincoln. This would involve testing the ability to accurately 
 
get individual length measurements and then apply a conversion factor. The 
second part of the trial would evaluate the technology in a transfer situation as 
occurs when fish are moved into holding pens. Australia further stated that if 
from there the trial was successful in showing stereo-video is able to meet 
Australia’s pre-conditions and the technology is able to be used in situ, then 
work would be undertaken with the management authority to determine 
necessary steps for implementation including any potential regulatory changes 
that may be required. 
32. New Zealand and the European Union sought additional information from 
Australia on the timeline involved in the regulatory process that may be required 
in order to domestically implement stereo-video. 
33. Australia explained that should the trial prove successful, it would be required to 
work through a number of additional steps to operationalise stereo video as a 
monitoring tool for its farm sector. The first would involve the design of a 
monitoring program. This program would largely be informed by the outcomes 
of the stereo video trial. Factors to consider include, but are not limited to: 
program objectives, outcomes and requirements, data governance, cost 
implications, appropriate technology and systems, data collection and 
consideration, including length weight conversions and sampling regimes. 
34. Domestic implementation would also require legislative change. Australia’s 
current monitoring regime is based on the 100 fish sample process and is 
considered within the existing legislative framework. Australia would need to 
consult broadly across government and seek legal advice on the implementation 
of legislating a new monitoring regime in the SBT farm sector. If implemented, 
Australia may need to undertake drafting and execution of new legislation and 
may also need to undertake a regulation impact statement, to determine how the 
increased regulation impacts stakeholders. It is likely the process for legislative 
change will involve statutory consultation timeframes. 
35. Finally, Australia would be required to undertake a formal tender process to 
approach the market to identify a supplier of SV services in the farm sector.  
This would be followed by a tender evaluation and then a subsequent 
engagement of the successful tenderer. 
36. While timing of implementation will need to be confirmed following the trial, 
based on Australia’s experience the three processes outlined above could take 
approximately 12 to 18 months in total to complete. 
37. Japan thanked Australia for this additional information and expressed its hope 
for steadfast progress towards operationalising of stereo-video along with future 
discussions at the ESC. 
38. New Zealand also thanked Australia for the insight provided into domestic 
processes and noted Australia’s commitment to progressing this issue. 
39. The European Union also expressed its view that stereo-video is an important 
issue, which has been present for many years. The European Union also noted 
Australia’s commitments and encouraged a prompt resolution. 
40. The Chair invited Japan to present paper CCSBT-EC/2210/20, which provides 
an update on the Japanese Market Proposal. 
 
41. Japan reminded the group that during last year’s meeting Dr Clarke was selected 
to work on the market survey. Dr Clarke was to study various elements of the 
Japanese market and rigorously performed her task. Japan noted that Dr Clarke 
interviewed market experts, conducted surveys, and looked into the existing 
formula and its underlying variables. Results from this exercise concluded that 
data from the CDS and current landing controls can be a good source of 
information to monitor SBT catch distributed in Japanese market and provide a 
more robust basis for catch verification. The approach to continue to use the 
formula could not be recommended because of the uncertainty involved. Based 
on results of Dr Clarke’s study showing six approaches, Japan will now consider 
these approaches and make a proposal next year. Japan suggested that all 
Member catch verification and monitoring approaches need to be improved. 
42. The Pew Charitable Trusts (Pew) expressed concerns that both the market and 
farm data issue are a potential backdoor to undermining CCSBT’s very 
successful Management Procedure (MP). Pew suggested that the previous 
decision to decouple TAC setting from the MP could undermine management. 
Pew further suggested that the sooner these two issues are resolved and 
incorporated into the MP the better. 
43. New Zealand stated that it appreciates the sentiments expressed by Pew having 
encouraged resolution for a number of years. New Zealand also highlighted the 
excellent work from Dr Clarke and had placed hope that it would resolve issues 
of market uncertainty. Although disappointed by the outcomes of the research, 
New Zealand was now encouraged by Japan’s commitment for a proposal next 
year. 
44. Based on pre-meeting and CC discussions, the EC agreed that the CCSBT will 
fund the management tag survey and market survey at Toyosu Market in Japan, 
to be commenced from 2023. The EC also agreed that the Executive Secretary 
will coordinate the detailed terms of reference and contract (including payment 
schedule) for implementing the survey.  
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
45. The independent Chair of the Compliance Committee, Mr Frank Meere, 
presented the report of CC 17, outlining key points from the meeting. The report 
is provided at Attachment 9. 
46. The CC Chair noted that CC 17 had been assisted by pre-meeting work but that 
the level of engagement was not as good as for CC 16, and this resulted in 
generally lower transparency and the meeting having to revisit many pre-
meeting agenda items during the VC session.  The CC Chair thanked the 
Secretariat and participants who actively engaged in the pre-meeting process. 
47. The CC Chair noted that South Africa did not attend CC 17, did not respond to 
questions raised in the pre-meeting document and had not provided a plan and 
timeframe for addressing its non-compliant issues identified by CC 16, which 
was to be provided as soon as practical and no later than CC 17.   
48. The CC Chair referred to and summarised elements of the CC 17 meeting report 
including the workplan (paragraph 142), recommendations to the EC (paragraph 
 
144), including the recommendation that a Technical Compliance Working 
Group (TCWG) meeting be held prior to CC 18, as well as items for the EC to 
note (paragraph 145). 
49. The CC Chair advised that CC 17 had endorsed the continuation of Indonesia’s 
Payback and Management Plans to re-pay its 2019 and 2020 over-catches and 
noted there were no new over-catch issues identified which required actions 
under the Corrective Actions Policy.  
50. However, the CC Chair noted that South Africa still had non-compliance issues 
which did require attention under the Corrective Actions Policy. 
51. The CC Chair advised that CC 17 identified significant non-compliance by 
Indonesia which had failed to implement CCSBT’s Transhipment Resolution for 
at-sea transhipments of SBT undertaken by its LSTLVs1 during 2021 and 2022. 
52. The CC Chair also highlighted some additional compliance issues discussed by 
CC 17 then advised the EC to consider the following CC 17 discussion: 
• With respect the current Corrective Actions Policy, Members had recognised 
the limits of this Policy and suggested that new tools be included within the 
Policy to further incentivise compliance;  
• Only one notification had been received in relation to Compliance Policy 
Guideline 5 (CPG5) and some clarifications were provided regarding when 
notifications should be made under this policy; 
• TCWG 3 had provided participants with their first opportunity to discuss the 
potential role Electronic Monitoring (EM) could play in the SBT fishery and 
it was recommended that an intersessional working group be established to 
meet virtually to consider some of the key issues with a discussion paper 
prepared in advance; 
• There were differing views regarding whether estimates of depredation 
should be included within Members’ Attributable Catch (AC); 
• It was recommended that the EC and SFMWG take the value of Quality 
Assurance Reviews (QARs) into consideration when developing the 
Performance Review Implementation Plan; 
• The Japanese market study results were considered and will be re-visited at 
CC 18; 
• It was recommended a Technical Compliance Working Group meeting be 
convened prior to the CC 18 in 2023 to discuss compliance risks to support 
the review of the Compliance Action Plan (CAP) and better quantify those 
risks; and 
• CC 17 recommended the development of the trial eCDS be continued and 
implemented, and requested that the associated eCDS workplan and budget 
for 2023 and beyond be endorsed. 
 
 
 
1 “LSTLV” means a tuna longline fishing vessel with Freezing Capacity, and a vessel is deemed to 
have “Freezing Capacity” if it has a freezer which is capable of storing more than 500 kilograms of 
SBT at -30°C or below”. 
 
53. With regard to CC 17’s discussion on the Performance Review 
recommendations: 
• There was discussion aided by Secretariat and by New Zealand to help 
identify key areas of work (Attachment 5 to CC 17’s Report); 
• The highest priority category areas of work identified (using a simplistic 
methodology) were compliance assessment, corrective actions and capacity 
building; and 
• Given the importance of scientific observer programs to many reporting and 
data collecting requirements, the Observer / EM category is also an area for 
consideration by the EC and SFMWG despite not having as high a priority 
score. 
54. In response to the compliance concerns noted, South Africa thanked the 
Secretariat and Chairs and stated its commitment to do more that is required to 
meet its CCSBT obligations and to work constructively and cooperatively to 
address all critical outstanding compliance matters.  It explained that it had lost 
many officials recently, especially those responsible for tuna and tuna-like 
species fisheries, as well as having had issues migrating its systems and 
infrastructure from one department over to the new department (DFFE2).   
55. Members had some sympathy with South Africa’s situation noting that they 
would like South Africa to clarify if it can submit its corrective plan of action, as 
well as its required reports and data, and uphold its obligation to attend 
meetings. 
56. Japan expressed its concern, as an importer, about the case of SBT shipments 
with no CDS forms or CDS forms containing incorrect information, or the case 
where tags from previous years were being used, and that it would like to work 
with South Africa to resolve these issues.  
57. South Africa appreciated the assistance offered by Members and committed to 
respond to all outstanding compliance matters including providing a timeframe 
within which to do so. 
58. Following further discussion, South Africa advised that it was unable to 
nominate a specific date when its Plan and associated timeline would be 
available but noted they would be submitted by CCSBT 30. South Africa also 
committed to maintaining regular contact with the Secretariat and assisting 
Members in the interim. 
59. Members requested that South Africa’s Plan be provided in advance of CCSBT 
30.  To assist South Africa and ensure regular communications are maintained, it 
was agreed the Executive Secretary would convene a contact group comprised of 
Secretariat personnel, potentially the CC Chair, and any assisting Members who 
wished to participate.  This group will communicate with South Africa on a 
regular basis until CCSBT 30 to assist South Africa to resolve issues, and to help 
give direction to the process of developing and delivering South Africa’s Plan 
and timeline prior to CCSBT 30. 
 
 
2 Department of Forest, Fisheries and the Environment. 
 
60. South Africa welcomed the proposal to communicate regularly through the 
group and advised it would provide relevant contact details for Ms. F. Savel and 
Mr. B. Liedemann who would be involved.   
61. Japan and New Zealand indicated interest in participating in the group. 
62. There were some questions and comments on CC 17’s report and 
recommendations including that: 
• Taiwan noted it supported the Secretariat using AIS analyses as a 
supplementary compliance monitoring tool but emphasised it should not be 
the primary or sole methodology for assessing Members’ compliance – the 
meeting noted Taiwan’s concern; 
• The Executive Secretary clarified that CC 17’s discussion of night setting 
concerned consistent reporting of night setting rather than the definition of 
night setting itself; 
• ACAP3 offered to contribute to the intersessional discussion of EM with 
respect to seabirds; and 
• It was clarified that endorsement of CC 17’s report and recommendations 
would mean that the recommended amendments to the Authorised Vessel 
Resolution were adopted. 
63. The meeting discussed Indonesia’s proposal to amend CCSBT’s Transhipment 
Resolution to allow Indonesia to conduct at-sea transhipments of SBT (including 
frozen SBT) to be observed by its own national observers rather than CCSBT 
transhipment observers4. Indonesia noted that the IOTC5 had agreed it could 
conduct a pilot project similar to this within the IOTC’s Area of Competence 
and that Indonesia was still developing the project with IOTC. 
64. Indonesia clarified that its proposal: 
• Pertained to the same 17 wooden Carrier Vessels (between 100 GT and 300 
GT in size) specified in Annex VI of the IOTC's Resolution 22/026;  
• Involved at-sea transhipments of frozen SBT and involved LSTLVs with 
freezing capacity; and 
• Could be modified to be a trial pilot project proposal with a mechanism for 
review if required. 
65. Indonesia also clarified that: 
• Transhipped fish/SBT are not landed outside Indonesia and must first be 
landed in domestic ports; 
• All 17 CVs would be observed and would not be able to go to sea without 
observers on board; and 
 
 
3 Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels. 
4 Currently provided through the Observer Consortium and MRAG. 
5 Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. 
6 Resolution 22/02 on Establishing a Programme for Transhipment by Large-scale Fishing Vessels. 
 
• Indonesian observers are trained to WCPFC's7 scientific observer standards 
and had additional training to enable them to identify SBT as well as tropical 
tunas.    
66. One Member clarified that Indonesia’s proposal means that, if agreed, Indonesia 
would be able to use non-independent national transhipment observers to 
observe its at-sea transhipments of SBT from LSTVs rather than the independent 
transhipment observers currently required by CCSBT’s Transhipment 
Resolution. 
67. Indonesia agreed to amend its proposal to take into account discussion points 
raised by Members, including to modify the proposal to be a pilot project with a 
review mechanism. 
68. Indonesia submitted its amended proposal to modify CCSBT’s Transhipment 
Resolution clarifying that: 
• Only the 17 named wooden Carrier Vessels (CVs) are involved (listed in the 
Annex); 
• A CV on the list may be replaced by a different CV but only if the substitute 
CV is also wooden and its fish hold volume is not larger than the hold 
volume of the CV being replaced; 
• The wooden CVs would receive transhipments in the IOTC area, not the 
Pacific Ocean; 
• Indonesia intentionally backdated the proposal to 2021, and this was done to 
align with the timeframe already agreed for a similar IOTC pilot project and 
to facilitate a report back in the same year as to IOTC; 
• In IOTC, standard independent MRAG transhipment observers cannot be 
deployed to wooden CVs due to safety concerns and this is the reason 
Indonesia proposed using national observers instead; and 
• IMO numbers are not mandatory for wooden Carrier Vessels. 
69. The CC Chair: 
• Emphasised that CC 17 had found Indonesia to be non-compliant with 
CCSBT’s Transhipment Resolution in 2021 (and 2022) and that Indonesia’s 
proposed amendment to the Transhipment Resolution was not discussed in 
any detail at CC 17; 
• Noted that backdating the proposal to 2021 is not appropriate when Indonesia 
has already been found non-compliant with respect to the CCSBT 
Transhipment Resolution for 2021; 
• Noted that transhipment in general has been identified as a high-risk activity 
and that allowing one Member to use non-independent national observers to 
observe at-sea transhipments could be seen as watering down the provisions 
of the Transhipment Resolution; 
• Queried why Indonesia’s CVs, as commercial merchant vessels, did not have 
IMO numbers; and 
 
 
7 Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission. 
 
• Noted that during CC 17’s deliberations, Indonesia had reiterated on 
numerous occasions that it had difficulties deploying observers due to 
logistical and financial constraints, etc, but that there seemed to be observers 
available for the 17 CVs named in Indonesia’s proposal. 
70. With regard to observers, Indonesia responded that it currently had only 80 
observers deployed across all its fisheries and that it had to prioritise their 
placement, and priority had been given to placing them on board the wooden 
CVs, which is why they were sometimes not available to observe longline 
fisheries.  
71. One Member queried whether Indonesia’s proposed amendments had been 
placed within the appropriate section of the Resolution. 
72. Pew noted that it might be prudent to consider the results of any available report 
backs to IOTC and it was noted that Indonesia’s 2023 report to IOTC as well as 
the IOTC’s response would be available before CCSBT 30.  
73. The CC Chair: 
• Commented that the standard process for proposals such as Indonesia’s 
would be to submit them in advance of CC meeting for the CC’s thorough 
consideration; 
• Noted that viewing available report backs to IOTC and any responses from 
the IOTC would be beneficial to all; and 
• Queried whether Indonesia’s proposed scheme meets CCSBT’s standards 
and sought advice from Indonesia as to whether the 17 CVs were fishing 
vessels with freezing capacity or dedicated CVs. 
74. Japan noted that the IOTC trial project is underway and Indonesian observers are 
already on board its wooden CVs and will be observing transhipments during 
2022 and 2023 in accordance with the IOTC Resolution. Japan stated its 
understanding that SBT could not be transhipped at sea to those wooden vessels 
until the examination of Indonesia’s proposal by CC 18 and EC 30, and that a 
CPG58 notification could be potentially made if Indonesia faces the difficulty of 
deployment of CCSBT observers for at-sea transhipments of SBT involving 
those wooden CVs. 
75. The Chair expressed appreciation to Indonesia for its proposal and for 
responding to all CC and EC’s requests for further information.  
76. The Chair summarised that there appeared to be uncertainty about the 
implications of the proposal, and that it may be broader in scope and more 
complex than initially understood, and that in normal circumstances it should 
first have been submitted to the CC for detailed examination.  The Chair 
therefore proposed that the proposal be referred to CC 18 for full consideration.  
77. The meeting agreed to consider Indonesia’s proposal at CC 18 and EC 30 and 
that it would be useful for some background analysis to be undertaken to better 
clarify the scope and implications of the proposal, noting the Secretariat may 
have the capacity to provide this background analysis.  
 
 
8 Compliance Policy Guideline 5. 
 
78. The EC Chair advised that the EC endorsed all of CC 17’s recommendations. 
The EC Chair also noted that the Compliance Committee did not identify issues 
with respect to the implementation of Indonesia’s payback and management plan 
for its 2019 and 2020 over-catch. 
 
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
79. The independent Chair of the ESC, Dr Kevin Stokes, presented the report of the 
ESC for the Twenty Seventh meeting of the Scientific Committee (ESC 27), 
which is summarised in papers CCSBT-EC/2210/09 and CCSBT-EC/2210/23, 
and provided in full at Attachment 10. 
80. The ESC Chair highlighted the key management recommendations from ESC 
27, which were: 
• There is no reason to modify the 2021-2023 TAC recommendation on the 
basis of Exceptional Circumstances; 
• An allocation of 6.0 t in 2023 be made to cover mortality associated with 
agreed research projects; and 
• The recommended TAC for 2024-2026 is 20,647 t. 
81. In response to a question as to why the stock assessment is separated from the 
MP, the ESC Chair clarified that it was mainly to help manage workloads of 
those involved but running the MP in advance of the stock assessment allowed 
for some lead-in time for planning and decision-making with respect to the TAC. 
82. The EC adopted the report of the ESC and endorsed its recommendations 
(including the recommended revisions to the CCSBT Scientific Observer 
Program Standards), noting that the new scientific research proposals under the 
SRP (and included as components of the ESC’s work program) would be further 
considered in the FAC and that the recommendations on the TAC and Research 
Mortality Allowance would be discussed further at Agenda Item 7. 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
7.1. Attributable SBT Catch 
83. The Chair noted that full implementation of the agreed CCSBT definition of 
Attributable SBT Catch commenced during the 2018 season and opened the 
floor for discussion on how each Member has accounted for its SBT mortalities.  
84. Most Members reported their total Attributable Catch as well as a breakdown of 
their SBT mortalities across different sectors.  The EU emphasised that it forbids 
its vessels to target SBT and that it had 0 t of SBT catch in 2021. Table 1 
summarises the Attributable Catches reported by each Member either during the 
meeting or in National Reports:

85. On the topic of depredation, New Zealand expressed the view that it believes 
that this type of mortality fits within the agreed definition of attributable catch 
and expressed concerns that some Members may be withholding information on 
depredation as part of their reporting to the Extended Commission. New Zealand 
further suggested that such a practice could be considered as non-compliance 
with the obligations found within the Resolution on Reporting all Sources of 
Mortality of Southern Bluefin Tuna. 
86. The EC noted that the ESC concluded that, on the basis of the available 
information, it does not consider depredation to be a priority issue and that the 
CC could not reach agreement on how best to account for depredation in the 
definition of the Attributable SBT Catch.  
 
7.2. TAC Determination 
Confirmation of the TAC for 2023 
87. The Chair noted that the global Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for 2021 to 2023 
was agreed at CCSBT 27 as being 17,647 t per year. The Chair further advised 
that the ESC, following its annual review of exceptional circumstances, agreed 
that there was no need to modify the TAC for 2023, and therefore the 2023 SBT 
global TAC should remain at 17,647 t. 
88. The meeting agreed that the SBT global TAC for 2023 would remain at 17,647 t.

Determination of the TAC for 2024 - 2026 
89. The Chair noted that the ESC has run the Management Procedure (MP) and has 
recommended a TAC of 20,647 t per year for 2024 to 2026, which is a 3,000 t 
increase over the TAC for 2021 to 2023. The ESC has recommended the 
adoption of this TAC. 
90. The Chair referred to discussion of TAC issues at previous meetings, including 
CCSBT 26 and 27. 
91. The meeting expressed its appreciation for the thorough work done by the ESC 
and noted that it had confidence in its advice that was based on high quality 
science that is robust to known uncertainties. 
92. Most Members supported adopting the recommended increase to the TAC of 
3000 t. 
93. One Member expressed its concern at the lack of progress on the stereo video 
(SV) and Japanese market issues and proposed to defer any decision on the TAC 
to next year’s meeting where it would like to see that real and measurable 
progress has been made on those issues. 
94. Most Members expressed their significant concern on the reluctance to accept 
the TAC increase recommended by ESC based on MP which all Members had 
agreed on and was the best scientific evidence at EC 29. It was commented that 
to delay application of the ESC recommendation for non-scientific reasons 
jeopardises CCSBT’s successful attempt to recover and sustainably manage 
SBT. It was also noted that it will adversely affect CCSBT’s reputation 
internally and externally. New Zealand did not agree and noted that a decision 
on the scientific advice had simply been deferred. 
95. Australia developed a work plan as a basis for measuring its progress 
implementing stereo video at Attachment 11. 
96. Based on the paper CCSBT-EC/2210/20, Japan will submit a detailed proposal 
intersessionally, probably, in May or June in 2023, subject to Members’ views, 
Japan will initiate a study on the Japanese market to report the progress at EC30 
in cooperation with the Secretariat, if necessary. 
97. Progress with the SV and Japanese market work will be reported by Australia 
and Japan respectively to the Secretariat for distribution to Members via 
Circular(s). The Secretariat will facilitate the provision and circulation of 
comments by other Members on the progress of this work. 
98. A decision on the TAC for 2024 to 2026 was deferred to EC 30. 
99. The EC also agreed to defer consideration of the allocation for 2024 to 2026 
until EC 30. 
 
7.3. Research Mortality Allowance 
RMA for research projects in 2023 
100. The EC approved a total of 6 tonnes of RMA requested for the following 
research projects in 2022/2023, which were endorsed by the ESC: 
• 1.5 t for the CCSBT Gene Tagging Project;  
 
• 0.1 t by Japan for trolling surveys of age-0 SBT in north West Australia and 
0.9 t by Japan for trolling surveys of age-1 SBT in south West Australia;  
• 3.0 t by Australia for a project to trial the use of stereo video technology to 
determine the weight of catch taken in Australia’s Southern Bluefin Tuna 
farming sector; and 
• 0.5 t in the event that a small number of popup satellite tags are released in 
2022-23 to examine localised GAB movement and behaviour over the 
summer. 
RMA to deduct from the TAC for 2024-2026 
101. The Chair advised that the EC needs to decide on the amount of Research 
Mortality Allowance (RMA) that is to be deducted from the TAC each year from 
2024 to 2026. 
102. The EC agreed to continue a 6 t of fixed deduction from the TAC from 2024 to 
2026 for RMA. 
 
7.4. Allocation of TAC 
Allocation of the TAC for 2023 
103. The Chair advised that the allocations and effective catch limits to Members for 
2021 to 2023 were agreed at CCSBT 27. These allocations and catch limits are 
provided in Table 2 below. 
 
Table 2:  Allocations (tonnes of SBT) to Members for 2021-2022 (and 2023).

104. The Chair further advised that the current effective catch limit for Indonesia of 
1,122.8 t includes a special temporary allowance of 80 t and the EC needs to 
consider the information provided to CC 17 on Indonesia’s compliance with its 
Payback Plan (including that no further over-catch has occurred), and progress 
 
 
13 Includes a deduction of 21 t for Japan’s voluntary transfer to Indonesia and a further 27 t for Japan’s 
voluntary transfer to South Africa. 
14 Includes a deduction of 7 t for Australia’s voluntary transfer to Indonesia. 
15 Includes voluntary transfers to Indonesia of 21 t from Japan, 7 t from Australia and the special 
temporary allowance of 80 t. 
16 Includes a voluntary transfer of 27 t to South Africa from Japan. 
 
with its management plan, and decide whether to endorse the continuation of this 
special temporary allowance (80 t) to Indonesia for the upcoming 2023 season. 
105. In consideration of Indonesia’s efforts and taking into account the CC’s 
recommendation, the EC agreed that the special temporary allowance of 80 t for 
Indonesia should continue into 2023. 
Allocation of the TAC for 2024 - 2026 
106. Indonesia advised that, as outlined in its opening statement, it would like the EC 
to review the current allocation of TAC to Members so that it better reflects 
Indonesia’s situation as a developing coastal state with direct access to SBT 
fishing grounds. 
107. Members expressed understanding of Indonesia’s position and suggested that 
Indonesia prepare a proposal for Members to consider at next year’s meeting but 
noted that discussions of allocation can be difficult and often take years to reach 
agreement in other forums.  
108. The EC agreed that Indonesia would provide a proposal for revising TAC 
allocation to EC 30 for consideration by Members. It was noted that the proposal 
would be for a simple adjustment to the allocation percentages and not a 
proposal for a completely new mechanism. 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Report from the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
109. The Chair advised that the Secretariat prepared an agenda paper (CCSBT-
EC/2210/11) for this item that provides a summary of the recommendations and 
advice from ERSWG 14. The full report of ERSWG 14 report is provided at 
Attachment 12.  
110. The independent Chair of the ERSWG, Mr Alexander Morison, presented the 
report of ERSWG 14, outlining key points from the meeting. There were two 
recommendations from the meeting, which were that the EC adopt: 
• The proposed template in Attachment B of paper CCSBT-ERS/2203/07 for 
summarising key points of ERSWG reports for provision to other tuna 
RFMOs. 
• The Multi-year Seabird Strategy at Attachment 4 of the ERSWG 14 report. 
The overall objective and five specific objectives of this strategy were agreed 
by the EC in 2019. The revised strategy contains actions under each specific 
objective that were developed and agreed during ERSWG 14. 
111. The ERSWG Chair reported other relevant advice to the EC from ERSWG 14, 
which included that: 
• The ERSWG did not seek to amend its previous advice that the level of 
interaction between seabirds and SBT fisheries is still a significant level of 
concern.  
• The ERSWG noted that ACAP has updated its advice concerning the most 
effective ways to reduce seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries. This 
still includes the use of the following three best practice measures 
simultaneously: branch line weighting, night setting and bird scaring lines. In 
 
addition, the use of any of three assessed hook shielding devices or the use of 
a newly assessed underwater bait setting device have now been 
recommended as suitable alternatives. 
• The meeting confirmed its previously agreed advice for all shark species 
caught in SBT fisheries, that there were currently no specific concerns about 
shark bycatch that warranted additional mitigation requirements.  
• The ERSWG considered the report of the CCSBT Performance Review. A 
total of 37 recommendations were initially determined to be of potential 
relevance to the scope of the ERSWG. Using simple criteria to evaluate the 
recommendations, seven recommendations were considered as being most 
important from the ERSWG’s perspective and required new action, noting 
that even with these recommendations, there were some differences of views 
between Members. 
• The EC had requested that the ERSWG consider the need for annual 
meetings and provide advice to the EC on how CCSBT’s focus on ERS can 
be improved, particularly on seabird bycatch. Recommendation PR2021-05 
from the Performance Review expressed a similar view. The ERSWG 
discussed this matter and agreed that more regular meetings should be held 
but to have a hybrid approach for future ERSWG meetings. This involves 
having a full, face-to-face ERSWG meeting every second year and scientific 
technical meeting(s) in the intersessional years. 
• It was agreed that national reports would only be submitted by Members to 
the full meetings of the ERSWG every second year. The intersessional 
meetings can be held virtually and would focus on specific technical 
priorities agreed by the Members. 
112. The ERSWG Chair also noted that the ERSWG plans to conduct a collaborative 
seabird spatially explicit fisheries risk assessment (SEFRA) amongst Members. 
The SEFRA will be one of the main focuses of ERSWG hybrid technical 
meetings originally planned for 2023. 
113. The EC endorsed the recommendations from ERSWG 14.  
114. The meeting thanked Mr Morison for Chairing the ERSWG since 2012 and the 
large impact he had. 
115. Some Members and observers noted the benefits that EM, which is included in 
the Multi-year Seabird Strategy, will bring with respect to both determining 
seabird bycatch and the level of compliance with mitigation measures. 
116. Birdlife International commented that the new CCSBT seabird project will 
hopefully come into effect next month and urged Members to engage with that 
project, noting that it also had a component relating to EM. 
117. The ERSWG chair made some concluding remarks concerning the work of the 
ERSWG during his term as the ERSWG Chair. He noted that seabird bycatch 
has been the most significant matter that the ERSWG has had to consider, that 
the scientific advice to the ERSWG and to the EC during this period has been 
that implementation of more effective mitigation measures based on best 
practice was urgently required, that best practice measures for mitigation of 
seabird bycatch have still not been mandated by CCSBT, and there has 
continued to be an annual bycatch of many thousands of seabirds in fisheries that 
 
target SBT. He further noted that advice on best practice measures and evidence 
of their successful implementation in other fisheries had been provided to the 
ERSWG since 2009, and that improved performance on ERS matters had been 
recommended in two CCSBT Performance Reviews, his view was that this was 
evidence that the ERSWG had been a group whose activities and advice have 
lacked any effective pathway to improved management outcomes. He requested 
that the EC consider the question of what it would take to establish a pathway to 
improved outcomes for the ERSWG and if this was not achievable by the 
CCSBT, he asked if this should be acknowledged and the responsibility for such 
important ERS matters be explicitly passed to the other area-based tuna RFMOs. 
118. The Humane Society International (HSI) commented that ACAP has declared a 
conservation crisis and that CCSBT is largely responsible for that crisis. In light 
of this, HSI questioned how CCSBT can consider a 3,000 t increase in the SBT 
TAC without considering the impacts of this on the crisis. 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Ecologically Related Species (ERS) 
119. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC, and at the CC.  
Update to CCSBT’s Resolution on Ecologically Related Species (ERS) 
120. The Chair advised that the pre-meeting discussion noted that there have been no 
ERS decisions by IOTC, WCPFC or ICCAT17 since CCSBT 28 that are of 
relevance to the CCSBT’s ERS Alignment Resolution. Consequently, no updates 
are proposed to the ERS Resolution for consideration by CCSBT 29. 
121. The EC agreed that there would be no updates to the ERS Alignment Resolution 
this year. 
Members’ performance with respect to ERS 
122. The Secretariat’s report on Members’ performance with respect to ERS was 
presented to the CC in paper CCSBT-CC/2210/05. The CC discussed this paper 
at its meeting in the previous week and the EC decided that it did not need to 
further discuss this paper. 
123. Australia noted that the delay in Australia’s data provision for the ERSWG Data 
Exchange this year was the result of upgraded data systems in relevant 
organisations which had been resolved and the data had now been submitted. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Report of the Performance Review of the CCSBT 
124. The Chair advised that the CCSBT Performance Review process commenced in 
November 2020 and the report of the 2021 Performance Review of the CCSBT 
was provided to Members on 1 March 2022. The Chair further noted that, in 
accordance with the Terms of Reference of the Performance Review, the 
ERSWG, ESC and CC considered any pertinent recommendations and provided 
 
 
17 International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. 
 
advice to CCSBT 29 on recommendations relating to them. The Chair advised 
that EC meeting needs to consider advice from subsidiary bodies and provide 
direction to the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group (SFMWG) 
in relation to development of an implementation plan for the Performance 
Review recommendations.  
125. The Chair of the CCSBT Performance Review Panel, Dr Hussain Sinan, 
presented the final report of the Panel (Attachment C of paper CCSBT-
CC/2210/13), in which the Panel’s key recommendations were highlighted. 
126. The EC thanked Dr Hussain Sinan and the members of the Performance Review 
Panel for their work in drafting this comprehensive report. Members were 
pleased to see that improvements had been achieved in several areas from 
previous iterations of the Performance Review but noted that some areas 
continue to be deficient. The meeting noted that the Performance Review 
provides a useful starting point for the next step of prioritisation and recognised 
that the responsibility now shifts to the Members. 
127. The Chair reminded Members of the Terms of Reference for this project which 
state that an implementation plan is now to be developed with the support of a 
SFMWG meeting in mid-2023. The Chair also noted pre-meeting discussions 
with Members that suggested that a draft implementation plan should be 
developed ahead of SFMWG and that this important exercise be shared amongst 
Members. 
128. Australia offered to lead the work on the development of a draft implementation 
plan. Japan, New Zealand, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Korea all confirmed their 
willingness to support Australia in this work. 
129. HSI wished to congratulate Members for undertaking the Performance Review 
seeing it as an important process and fully supporting the direction that has been 
taken. 
130. BLI also thanked Members for implementing the Performance Review. In 
particular, BLI wishes to highlight the issues identified around ERS and supports 
the recommendation that suggests a renewed focus on ERS. 
131. In response to a question from the Chair, the ERSWG Chair suggested that one 
area that could be considered for early implementation is a potential review of 
the Convention to clarify the role and mandate of CCSBT with regard to ERS. 
The ERSWG Chair noted the lengthy process typically associated with a change 
to the Convention, and that a decision on any changes to the Convention might 
have implications for how other recommendations were addressed, as possible 
justifications for work to begin as soon as possible. 
132. Noting the importance of the area raised by ERSWG Chair, Japan noted that the 
discussion on this issue would require consideration of relationship with other 
Tuna-RFMOs as CCSBT does not have geographical area of its competence. 
133. Taiwan agreed that some of the recommendations were likely to take more time 
to achieve, such as modernisation of the Convention. Taiwan also wished to note 
that not all issues of high importance had been identified through the subsidiary 
bodies and that work remains for the SFMWG. 
134. The Chair thanked Australia for leading the intersessional work on a draft 
implementation plan and referred further discussions to the SFMWG. 
 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
135. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC.  
136. The Secretariat submitted paper CCSBT-EC/2210/14 which summarised the 
Secretariat’s interactions with non-Members since CCSBT 28. China, Fiji, 
Mauritius, Singapore and the USA were invited to attend this meeting and CC 
17. 
137. The EC agreed to invite China, Fiji, Mauritius, Panama, Singapore and the USA 
to participate as observers at CC 18 and CCSBT 30. 
138. Japan requested that the Secretariat continue its efforts to approach those 
countries which have fished or traded SBT for their participation in the meeting. 
139. The Chair thanked the United States for its continued cooperation with the 
CCSBT’s Catch Documentation Scheme. The Chair also thanked Fiji, Mauritius, 
and Panama for attending this meeting, which was appreciated. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
12.1. Reports from other RFMO meetings of interest  
140. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC.  
141. Members have acted as CCSBT observers at RFMO meetings of interest, and 
these Members have provided reports back to the CCSBT on matters of 
relevance in order to improve coordination with other RFMOs.  
142. The following reports were provided by Members as part of their Observer 
duties for the CCSBT. 
• Korea’s report (CCSBT-EC/2210/19) on the 18th Regular Session of the 
WCPFC;  
• New Zealand’s report (CCSBT-EC/2210/22) on the 40th Annual Meeting of 
the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
(CCAMLR);  
• Indonesia’s report (CCSBT-EC/2210/24) in relation to the Twenty Sixth 
session of the IOTC; 
• Japan’s report (CCSBT-EC/2210/21) on the 2021 Discussions on Essential 
Commission Business in Lieu of The 27th Regular Meeting of ICCAT; and 
• Taiwan’s report (CCSBT-EC/2210/18) in relation to the 99th Extraordinary 
Meeting and 100th Annual Meeting of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna 
Commission (IATTC). 
143. It was agreed that the following Members would act as Observers to other 
RFMOs on behalf of CCSBT during 2022/23: 
• Korea to continue as Observer to WCPFC; 
 
• New Zealand to continue as an Observer to CCAMLR;  
• Indonesia to continue as an Observer to IOTC; 
• Japan to continue as an Observer to ICCAT; and 
• Taiwan to continue as an Observer to IATTC. 
144. The Chair thanked these Members for providing their reports and for agreeing to 
be CCSBT observers again next year. 
 
12.2. Arrangement between CCSBT and CCAMLR  
145. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC. 
146. The Secretariat’s paper CCSBT-EC/2210/15 reported on the status of the 
Arrangement between CCSBT and CCAMLR, which is now overdue for review 
and renewal. The paper advised that both the CCSBT and CCAMLR Secretariats 
consider that the cooperation between the two organisations has been beneficial 
and that it would be appropriate to renew the Arrangement in its current form. 
147. The EC agreed to renew the Arrangement with CCAMLR in its current form, 
providing that the annual CCAMLR meeting also agrees to renew the 
Arrangement. 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Confidentiality of Data and Documents 
13.1.   Confidentiality of reports and documents from 2022 
148. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC.  
149. The meeting agreed that all the reports of meetings and documents submitted to 
meetings under the jurisdiction of CCSBT 29 would be made publicly available 
with the exception of Attachment A of paper CCSBT-ESC/2208/04 from the 
Secretariat titled “Secretariat Review of Catches”. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Meetings for 2023 
150. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC.  
151. The EC agreed that the dates for the ESC, CC and EC meetings in Korea during 
2023 will be: 
• The 28th Extended Scientific Committee meeting, in Jeju island, from 28 
August to 2 September 2023;  
• The 4th Technical Compliance Working Group Meeting, in Busan, on 4 
October 2023; 
• The 18th Compliance Committee Meeting, in Busan, from 5 to 7 October 
2023; and   
 
• The 30th Extended Commission Meeting, in Busan, from 9 to 12 October 
2023. 
152. It was further agreed that an Operating Model and Management Procedure 
(OMMP) technical meeting would be held during June/July 2023 to consider the 
full stock assessment, and that the dates for this meeting will be determined by 
the Executive Secretary in consultation with Member scientists. 
153. It was agreed that a face-to-face SFMWG meeting will be held to consider an 
implementation plan for the recommendations of the Performance Review. The 
meeting will be held during mid-2023 at a date and location to be determined by 
the Executive Secretary in conjunction with Members. Members have been 
requested to volunteer to host the meeting. If there are no volunteers, the 
location will default to Canberra, where the CCSBT is headquartered.  
154. A virtual ERS technical meeting will also be held during 2023, at a date to be 
determined by the Executive Secretary in conjunction with relevant Member 
scientists. 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Election of the Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended 
Commission of the Thirtieth Annual Meeting of the CCSBT 
155. The Chair advised that there were no nominations for the Chair and Vice-Chair 
of the EC, and that consequently, the Chair and Vice-Chair will be determined in 
accordance with past practice and the rotation of meetings. Therefore, Korea will 
be Chair of the EC and Taiwan will be Vice-Chair. 
156. The Chair requested that Korea and Taiwan provide their nominations for the 
Chair and Vice-Chair to the Secretariat as soon as possible. 
157. Korea advised that it would nominate a Chair as soon as possible. 
158. Taiwan advised that it would nominate a Vice Chair as soon as possible. 
 
Agenda Item 16. 
Other Business 
159. New Zealand advised that it has an albatross tracking project that overlaps with 
SBT fishing grounds and formally requested Members to inform their fleet and 
ask their vessels to cooperate with the program. If crew find tracking devices 
they should be returned to the program. 
160. Members supported the program, and it was agreed that the flyer for the project 
would be circulated to Members by the Secretariat.    
161. New Zealand noted that it had been reflecting on the issue raised by HSI on 
potential increases in seabird bycatch if the SBT TAC is increased. New Zealand 
further commented that this is an issue that should be considered by the EC over 
the course of the year before the TAC is reconsidered at EC 30. 
162. HSI asked whether consideration of the seabird issue will be linked to the 
decision on the TAC increase and allocations, and Birdlife International asked 
whether observers can be involved in these discussions. 
 
163. The Chair advised that the decisions to be taken at the next meeting are up to the 
next EC and that no decisions have been taken at this point. The Chair further 
advised that discussion of the TAC next year will not necessarily be in Heads of 
Delegation meetings and that the vast majority of the EC’s proceedings are in 
plenary and are thus available to be observed.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, wherever you may be. 
First let me thank New Zealand for hosting the meeting. It is our hope this will be the 
last virtual meeting, at least for a while, and we can soon return to our usual face-to-
face meetings.  
We would also like to acknowledge the Chair, Mr Don Mackay, the Secretariat for the 
meeting papers and arrangements, which are of the usual high standard, our excellent 
and patient translators and of course all other delegates and delegations  
This year the Commission is faced with the task of deciding on the Total Allowable 
Catch limits for the next quota block, taking into account the very positive outcome of 
the Cape Town Procedure this year and the recommended maximum increase in 
global total allowable catch.  
Implementing the management procedure has supported the recovery of the SBT 
stock, after many difficult years, and it is critical that we maintain that discipline 
going forward, to ensure continued recovery, and broader confidence in the 
management framework for the fishery.  
The reputation of the CCSBT in adhering to management procedure recommendations 
makes it a role model for other RFMOs. Australia is heartened to see management 
procedures adopted in other RFMOs, including most recently the Bigeye Tuna 
Management Procedure in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. 
Australia will update the Commission on the work we have done towards the 
implementation of stereo video, noting the difficulties of international work due to 
COVID 19 travel restrictions – including for this meeting.  
I understand the Compliance Committee put considerable effort into considering how 
depredation is accounted for by Members, and how depredation might be considered 
in the context of the Resolution on Reporting all Sources of Mortality. We look 
forward to discussing this further this week. 
Australia is proud to take on the role Chair of the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC) this year. The work of the FAC is critical to our work, and I 
understand its work is growing in importance as the CCSBT budget deficit continues 
to grow. Australia will work with all Members to prioritise the most critical work for 
the Commission, with an emphasis on work that is truly necessary to manage the 
stock.  
I note many Members, including Australia, still struggle to meet existing obligations 
and we need to think carefully about expanding CCSBT obligations to ensure they do 
not add unnecessary cost and burden to Members and the Secretariat, without 
demonstrably benefiting the management of the SBT stock. 
And finally we would like to welcome Mr Dominic Vallières as the incoming 
Executive Secretary, and acknowledge the impending retirement of the current 
Executive Secretary, Mr Robert Kennedy. We will speak more on the excellent 
contribution Mr Kennedy has made to the CCSBT at the meeting. 
Like everyone here, Australia is committed to working constructively with all 
members this week to achieve the best outcomes for CCSBT.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Honorable Chairperson, Distinguished Delegates, Observers, Ladies, and Gentlemen, 
The Taiwan delegation is very pleased to participate in the 29th meeting of the 
CCSBT. First of all, I would like to extend our appreciation to Mr. Kennedy, the 
Executive Secretary, and the Secretariat staff for your excellent arrangements for the 
virtual meetings and also for the comprehensive meeting documents.  
The COVID-19 pandemic is still challenging for all of us. Nonetheless, even in this 
difficult time, Taiwan still endeavours to mitigate the impact of the pandemic to the 
greatest extent possible and to comply with all resolutions of CCSBT. For example, at 
the beginning of 2022, we vaccinated all our observers and dispatched them to the 
vessel again.  
In this meeting, we will decide the SBT total allowable catch (TAC) for 2024-2026. 
According to the report, the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) recommended the 
annual TAC for the years 2024-2026 is 20,647 tons, which is 3,000 tons higher than 
the current TAC. This is very inspiring. Taiwan is glad to see the increment, for it is a 
positive sign of SBT conservation.  
Today, I would like to especially extend our appreciation to the Executive Secretary, 
Mr. Kennedy, whose term will end at the end of this year. Taiwan is very grateful to 
Mr. Kennedy for all your efforts to conserve the SBT and ERS and to arrange the 
administrative affairs in these years. Also, I would like to congratulate Mr. Vallieres, 
who will be the new Executive Secretary. We are looking forward to working with 
you. 
Finally, I wish we will have a productive and successful meeting, and that we will 
achieve constructive outcomes for the sustainability of the SBT fishery. Thank you.

Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Honorable Chair 
Executive Secretary of the Commission 
Distinguished Delegates, Observers. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. 
Indonesia would like to extend our sincere appreciation towards Chair, Vice Chair, 
and the Secretariat respectively, that had been working hard to arrange and facilitate 
the meeting this year. 
Today’s online format meeting reflects the fact that the Covid19 pandemic is still very 
much with us. But we are grateful that we can at least have this format and be able to 
see all of you in this platform. 
Despite the conditions, Indonesia is still committed to attend and actively participate 
in various CCSBT meetings. We hope that today’s meeting achieves best and fruitful 
decision for all members, to ensure sustainable SBT management. 
Honorable Chair and distinguished delegates, 
Despite the fact that Total Allowable Catch (TAC) remains unchanged for 2023 based 
on the Extended Scientific Committee, Indonesia welcomes the potential of an 
increase in TAC for the 2024-2026 quota block. However, Indonesia suggests that the 
discussion on the distributions of quota block allocation of 2024-2026 for each 
member to be undertaken offline in 2023 rather than this year (2022). 
Indonesia concerns with the current SBT quotas allocation. In this regard, Indonesia 
believes that it is necessary to review the quota allocation mechanism which will be 
discussed next year in order to give greater consideration to the interests of 
developing coastal states. 
Honorable Chair and distinguished delegates, 
Indonesia is well-aware its inadequate participation in the scientific work process, 
particularly in CCSBT’s two key scientific bodies, - the Operating Model and 
Management Procedure (OMMP) and the Ecologically Related Species Working 
Group (ERSWG). This is an unfortunate reality due to its constraints on both financial 
resource and human resource capacity. 
Along this line, Indonesia proposes a Meeting Participant Fund mechanism for 
developing coastal states, and it is envisaged that a capacity development program for 
researchers from developing coastal states would be established so that they can 
actively engage and contribute in the scientific work process at CCSBT. 
I thank you. 
Attachment 4 – 4 
 
Opening Statement by Japan 
 
Honourable Chair, 
Executive Secretaries, Distinguished Delegates of All Members and Observers. 
First of all, on behalf of the Japanese delegation, I would like to offer our sincere 
congratulations to Mr. Dominic Vallières on his appointment as new Executive 
Secretary of Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT). 
We are pleased to continue to work along with the Secretariat under his leadership.  
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Executive Secretaries and the 
staff of the Secretariat for their efforts to prepare for and organise this meeting under 
difficult situation where the COVID-19 still affects face-to-face communication. 
Moreover, we would also like to thank interpreters for their excellent contributions to 
facilitate our discussions. 
CCSBT has agreed on and implemented the well-established Management Procedure 
(MP). Applying Operation of the current MP (Cape Town Procedure), the Extended 
Scientific Committee recommended the increase in global Total Allowable Catch 
(TAC) for 2024-2026. While the next stock assessment will be conducted in 2023, the 
last assessment indicated the stock has increased from the previous assessment. This 
is the evidence that the established CCSBT’s conservation and including TAC 
management has worked well in rebuilding and conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna. As a Member of CCSBT, we are honoured to cooperate for appropriate 
implementation of the conservation measures.  
On the other hand, CCSBT needs to continue to decrease uncertainty in management 
of Southern Bluefin Tuna. In this regard, the evident contributions such as 
strengthening implementation of the measures and data collection by all the Members 
will further strengthen the robustness of the conservation measures including MP. 
Japan is pleased to participate in the constructive discussions and cooperate in further 
improvement of the current measures for achieving the rebuilding goal of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna.  
Finally, I would like to express our deep gratitude to Mr. Robert Kennedy for his 
longtime and dedicated works toward CCSBT and all the Members. We hope all the 
best for him in the future.  
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Tena koutou katoa: Greetings one and all 
The New Zealand delegation is disappointed that we were unable to physically host 
this meeting of CCSBT to showcase our beautiful country. Nonetheless a virtual 
welcome to all participants. 
We express our appreciation for the work of the Secretariat and the CCSBT subsidiary 
bodies during the year and welcome Mr Vallieres as the new Executive Secretary. We 
will express our regards and thanks to the outgoing Executive Secretary at the 
conclusion of our meeting.  
We have several important issues on our agenda for the meeting this week.  Key 
among those for New Zealand is the setting of the TAC and its allocation.  In this 
regard we continue to believe that the failure to resolve uncertainty in farm and 
market reporting undermines our and other Members’ interests. It remains our 
position that real and measurable progress on these matters is a precursor to any future 
increase in the global total allowable catch and we will reflect on this during the 
course of this meeting. 
Our best wishes to all and we look forward to productive discussions. 
Attachment 4 – 6 
 
Opening Statement by the Republic of Korea 
 
Greetings from Sejong, Korea. 
First and the foremost, Korea would like to thank the Chairman of the Commission 
and the Secretariat for organising the 29th meeting of CCSBT. Although we have seen 
some progress or improvements in the global COVID-19 situation, we have to say we 
are disappointed that CCSBT Members can not meet in person again this year. We do 
hope that we would be able to meet all Members in Korea next year. 
This year, as usual, we have a number of issues to deal with during the meeting 
including the decisions on TAC and its allocation, ERS related issues as well as other 
important matters. In particular, as the current 3-year management period will end in 
2023, the Commission has to agree on the TAC for the next management period. It is 
our sincere hope that the Commission would be able to agree on the new TAC based 
on mutual understanding and spirit of cooperation. Although there still remain issues 
to resolve with the application of CTP, we expect that Members will show a 
reasonable level of flexibility in discussing these issues. 
Also, we note that this meeting would be the last one for the Executive Secretary Mr. 
Bob Kennedy. Taking this opportunity, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude 
to him for the tremendous job he has done and the priceless contribution he has made 
to the work of the Commission as well as the recovery of SBT stock. We firmly 
believe that CCSBT wouldn’t have been what it is now without his dedication and 
contribution. We wish him all the best for his future endeavours. 
At the same time, we would like to congratulate Mr. Dominic Vallieres for his 
election and warmly welcome him as the new Executive Secretary. He has taken the 
role of FAC Chair for a long time and we appreciate his excellent service. Based on 
our experience with him so far, we have no doubt that he will lead the Secretariat 
efficiently and successfully. 
Finally, we very much look forward to working with the Chairman, all Members, 
NGOs and the Secretariat at the Extended Commission meeting, and hope the meeting 
will be a productive one. 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by BirdLife International 
 
BirdLife International thanks the Extended Commission for the opportunity to 
participate in this meeting and for continuing progress to improve fisheries 
management. We recognise the ongoing difficulties of the circumstances caused by 
COVID-19 and sincerely appreciate the efforts that have been made to continue work 
and hold meetings. 
BirdLife International re-emphasizes the responsibilities of CCSBT Members to 
minimise bycatch of seabirds as established under the United Nations Fish Stocks 
Agreement and committed to in member’s National Plans of Actions for Seabirds. 
The Members’ 2021 fishing year annual reports highlight worryingly low levels and 
poor spatial representation of observer coverage, which is severely impacting the 
ability of the Commission to verify compliance with all Conservation and 
Management Measures (CMMs). Without observers or electronic monitoring, there is 
no way to verify if Members are meeting their obligations to minimise impacts on 
ecologically related species. 
Information presented at ERSWG 14 highlighted ongoing significant seabird bycatch 
issues, with an estimated 13,000 seabirds killed in the two previous years that haven’t 
been impacted by reduced observer coverage (2018/19). We would remind the 
Commission that the CCSBT fishing area has the greatest overlap with seabird 
distribution of any of the tuna RFMOs, and as identified in the Performance Review 
there is still much work to be done to remedy the situation. We urge all Members to 
prioritise actions to improve implementation of seabird bycatch mitigation measures, 
and also to improve monitoring of measures and bycatch rates. 
BirdLife once again emphasizes that electronic monitoring (EM) is an important tool 
in the suite of compliance and data collection tools to overcome the challenges that 
COVID-19 has presented. This pandemic highlights the importance of taking urgent 
action to increase EM in SBT fleets to ensure that compliance monitoring occurs. 
BirdLife notes that without verification through human observer reported data, 
electronic monitoring (EM), or high seas and portside inspections, self-reported data 
by Members remain questionable. 
BirdLife is committed to collaborative efforts to improve the implementation of 
seabird bycatch mitigation measures in CCSBT fisheries. The intersessional work to 
prepare for the FAO funded seabird project is almost complete, thanks to the efforts of 
the Members, and especially the Secretariat. We look forward to seeing the project 
implemented over the next few years, and actions taken by Members to tackle high 
levels of seabird bycatch. 
. 
Attachment 5 – 2 
 
Opening Statement by Humane Society International 
 
Humane Society International (HSI) wishes to thank the Extended Commission for 
the opportunity to participate once again as an observer to this important decision-
making meeting. We look forward to further progress in securing the sustainability of 
the SBT fishery, both in terms of SBT and in terms of the impact that SBT fishing has 
on non-target species, seabirds in particular, which Members have agreed is the main 
incidental catch of concern. 
Importantly we take this opportunity to farewell Bob Kennedy and commend his 
tireless and exemplary work as Executive Secretary. We look forward to continuing in 
our role as Observer to the Commission and extend a warm welcome to Dominic 
Vallieres. 
While it is encouraging to note CCSBT Members MP efforts will again likely be 
rewarded with a TAC increase, it is of grave concern to HSI that the concurrent 
fishing effort increase will have the predictable consequence of 500 annual additional 
seabird deaths. That this would be allowed to happen in the face of an already 
declared conservation crisis, is a situation surely demanding much more aggressive 
remedial measures. 
The Report of the 28th Annual Meeting of the Commission (Paras 87 & 88) detail 
concerns over the implication for seabirds of any TAC increase and while at that time 
Members agreed ERS issues should be considered separately to the SBT stock, surely 
before EC29 endorses a TAC recommendation, advice on seabird bycatch 
implications of fishing effort increase would first be necessary from the ERSWG. 
Preventing a deepening of the seabird conservation crisis because of TAC increase 
should entail remedial action advice from the working group for the Commission to 
act on concurrent with a TAC increase. HSI urges advice from the working group and 
decisions from the Commission on a process for mitigation before further TAC 
increase. 
HSI again takes the opportunity to encourage CCSBT to adopt binding requirements 
for vessels to use effective seabird bycatch mitigation measures, as a condition of 
access to the SBT fishery, and that these requirements reflect best practice bycatch 
mitigation as recommended by the Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses 
and Petrels (ACAP). It should be noted that existing seabird bycatch mitigation 
measures of WCPFC, IOTC and ICCAT fall short of ACAP best practice advice, 
which includes more effective line weight specifications and the use of not two, but 
three measures in areas of highest albatross bycatch. HSI looks forward to seeing 
CCSBT Members work to strengthen required mitigation measures and prevent 
noncompliance. This can be achieved by fully utilising EMS for monitoring and 
compliance, heeding specific recommendations of the Performance Review and by 
implementing the Seabird Strategy of the CCSBT. 
The EC is reminded that, of all five tuna commissions, CCSBT has the greatest 
overlap between its fisheries and albatrosses and that those albatross populations in 
serious decline have been declared to be facing a conservation crisis, largely because 
of an inability identified by the Performance Review for the impacts of the SBT 
fishery to be addressed. Those recommendations in particular of the Performance 
Review need priority action. 
Thank you Chair and Members for your time.

Resolution on the Establishment of a Meeting Participation Fund  
for Developing States of CCSBT Members 
(Adopted at the Twenty-Ninth Annual Meeting: 14 October 2022) 
 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), 
RECOGNISING that Article 25 paragraph 3 of the Agreement for the 
Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention of the Law of 
the Sea of December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of 
Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UNFSA) describes, inter 
alia, forms of cooperation with developing States and the need for assistance 
relating to collection, reporting, verification, exchange and analysis of fisheries data 
and related information; and stock assessment and scientific research; 
RECALLING that the Twenty-Eight Annual Meeting of the Commission noted that 
some scientists of developing Members are unable to attend some scientific 
meetings, which hinders their understanding of the science; 
ADOPTS, in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8 of the Convention for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (Convention), that: 
1. 
A special Meeting Participation Fund (MPF) be established for the purposes 
of supporting scientists and representatives from CCSBT Members who are 
developing States to attend and/or contribute to CCSBT meetings related to 
Scientific Works.  
2. 
In accordance with Article 11(5) of the Convention, the MPF shall not be used 
to fund attendance at meetings of the Commission or the Scientific Committee. 
3. 
The MPF shall be financed from an initial allocation of AUD 50,000 from the 
CCSBT’s funds, and subsequently by voluntary contributions from Members 
and such other sources as the Commission may identify. The Commission will 
identify, at its 29th Annual Meeting of CCSBT, a procedure for supplying 
funds to the MPF in the future. 
4. 
The MPF will be administered by the CCSBT Executive Secretary, in 
accordance with the same financial controls as regular budget appropriations. 
5. 
The CCSBT Executive Secretary shall establish a process for notifying 
Members annually of the level of available funds in the MPF, and provide a 
timeline and describe the format for the submission of applications for 
assistance. 
6. 
The CCSBT Executive Secretary shall submit an annual report to the 
Commission on the status of the MPF, including a financial statement of 
contributions to and disbursements from the MPF; 
7. 
The MPF would be utilised, as a first priority, to support the participation of 
scientists and representatives from developing States in scientific meetings of 
the CCSBT, including Working Groups. Support will be limited to funding of 
economy airfares, other transport costs, accommodation, and meals. 
Payments for accommodation and meals will not exceed that of the United 
Nations Daily Subsistence Allowance. Eligible participants may submit an 
application for assistance from the MPF. Applicants will be selected by a 
panel including the Chair of the scientific subsidiary body concerned, the 
CCSBT Executive Secretary and the Chair of the CCSBT Scientific 
Committee, in accordance with the process established in 5 above. The 
decision by the Panel shall also take into account the size of the MPF and the 
need for cost-effectiveness. Consideration of applications shall also include 
an assessment of whether any alternative sources of assistance are available. 
No more than two eligible participants from a single Member may be 
supported to participate in a single CCSBT scientific meeting. 
8. 
Applicants should note that alternative avenues of funding are available to 
developing State Members who wish to send scientists to CCSBT scientific 
meetings. For example, a fund has been established under Part VII of UNFSA 
to assist developing States that are signatories of the UNFSA to implement its 
provisions, including participation in the work of Regional Fisheries 
Management Organisations. For those eligible Members of CCSBT, this 
could provide for an alternative source of funding to participate in meetings 
of the Commission and subsidiary bodies or to fund attendance at CCSBT 
meetings as training and capacity building required to fulfil the obligations 
under the UNFSA. 
 
 
 
 
Attachment 8 
 
Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
CCSBT Members agreed to Mr Neil Hughes (Australia) chairing the Finance and 
Administration Committee (FAC). The FAC was tasked with the following agenda:  
• Revision of the 2022 budget.  
• Drafting of the 2023 budget; and  
• Drafting of the indicative budgets for 2024 and 2025 
The FAC was also asked by the Extended Commission (EC) for advice on a proposal 
by Indonesia for a meeting participation fund (MPF) mechanism in the CCSBT (paper 
CCSBT-EC/2210/17 refers). 
The revised budget for 2022 
The Executive Secretary provided a summary of the 2022 revised budget prior to the 
meeting and FAC Members were asked to provide initial comments at that time. 
Details of the revised budget are also outlined in CCSBT-EC/2210/05. The revision 
incorporates actual income and expenditure together with forecast income and 
expenditure for the remainder of the year.  
Expenditures for 2022 are forecast to total $3,180,709, which is a 12.9% decrease on 
the amount approved for 2022. Once again, this year, many of the reduced 
expenditures were a result of the global pandemic and its impact on the operations of 
the Extended Commission (e.g., the replacement of physical meetings with virtual 
fora). 
Most Members have paid their 2022 contributions to the CCSBT in full, except for 
Korea who have an outstanding payment amount of $63,925.94. Korea apologised for 
the delay in making the payment, noting the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the 
global geopolitical issues which had affected Korea’s operating budget. Korea advised 
the FAC that this amount is likely to be paid in the first half of 2023, along with 2023 
contributions due at that time, although they would make their best endeavours to 
make the outstanding payment sooner if possible. Korea also mentioned that it was 
hoping that this amount would not cause any problem to the normal operation of the 
Commission given the total budget. FAC Members thanked Korea for this 
explanation. 
The forecast income for the Extended Commission was slightly higher than 
anticipated due to a higher carryover from the previous year and slightly higher 
interest on investments. 
Members of the FAC thanked the Secretariat for the revised budget and endorsed it. 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission note the revised budget for 
2022 at Annex A. 
Draft budget for 2023 
The FAC considered the proposed budget for 2023 outlined in CCSBT-EC/2210/06, 
which includes funding for the CCSBT’s usual business.  
This draft budget has been developed under the assumption that most meetings of the 
Commission will return to physical meetings in 2023. However, the FAC recognised 
that these expenses will be lower if Members choose to use virtual means to meet in 
some cases. 
In the Secretariat’s paper on the draft 2023 budget, it was noted that current 
contribution levels are not sufficient to cover the annual running costs of the CCSBT. 
Therefore a ~3.5% increase in membership contributions for 2023 and a 5% increase 
per year from 2024 to 2028, together with use of the remaining savings put aside in 
2016 to ease the impact of changes to the CCSBT Science Program and from the 
Contributions Stabilisation Fund (CSF) was considered necessary to reach a 
contribution level that would cover the annual running costs of the CCSBT. It is likely 
that an increase in ~5% will be required from 2024 onward. 
Members of the FAC expressed concerns about the potential fiscal risks associated 
with the current disparity between income and revenue and chose to explore a number 
of differing scenarios for Member contributions and Commission expenses. The FAC 
gave particular attention to the potential cost savings from virtual meetings when 
assessing the range of meetings proposed for 2023.  
The draft budget for 2023, presented in paper CCSBT-EC/2210/06, contained 
$149,300 more expenditure than the agreed budget 2022 that was provided in Circular 
#2022/042. This increased expenditure was related to the inclusion of the following 
new items from the updated ESC 27 workplan: 
• Operating Model (OM) specification and software upgrade ($130,000). 
• CPUE Index development ($30,000). 
• Update Non-Cooperating Non-Member UAM estimates of unaccounted 
fishing mortality ($20,000); and 
• Second workshop on otolith-based ageing of southern bluefin tuna ($38,000). 
The total cost for these projects in 2023 is $218,000, but $66,400 of this expenditure 
had been anticipated in Circular #2022/042, so the ESC 27 workplan only adds 
$151,600 to the previously anticipated science program costs for 2023. 
At the request of some Members, the Secretariat prepared a working paper listing all 
CCSBT planned meetings for 2023, with approximate costs for in-person meetings 
compared to virtual meetings. FAC Members noted significant savings available by 
continuing virtual meetings but acknowledged the significant benefits of in-person 
meetings. Some Members proposed the SFMWG be held virtually, given the 
significant savings this option potentially offered. However, a number of participants, 
including a member of the performance review panel, spoke of the likely complexity 
of the upcoming SFMWG meeting and the importance of developing an action plan to 
implement agreed performance review recommendations, and advice was sought from 
the EC on this. The EC agreed the meeting be held in person with the location of the 
meeting to be confirmed.  
The Secretariat provided further information on potential costs for an in-person 
SFMWG meeting, based on locations. It was noted that costs for Busan, Korea, were 
likely to be close to the maximum for any location. Costs were also provided for 
Canberra, which were significantly below the Busan estimate. The FAC 
recommended the EC be asked to seek nominations to host the meeting from 
Members, as well as voluntary contributions towards the cost of the meeting, as a way 
of reducing costs to the CCSBT.  
Indonesia asked that Members consider making funding available to support the 
participation of developing States at technical meetings through the MPF (e.g., 
ERSWG and OMMP) noting that other RFMOs have established such mechanisms 
(CCSBT-EC/2210/17). One Member noted that while they were supportive of the idea 
of a MPF, that there could be benefit in exploring ways to reduce the impact on the 
CCSBT budget. 
Members supported the proposal, noting the link between the proposed fund and 
capacity building recommendations contained in the CCSBT Performance Review, 
but recommended that the MPF not provide support for attendance at regular CCSBT 
meeting, including EC, CC, and ESC.  
The FAC recommends $50,000 be initially drawn from CCSBT funds to establish the 
meeting participation fund from 2023, with ongoing funding for future years to be 
either from the CCSBT budget, or by way of voluntary Member contributions to the 
fund, up to the total fund amount of $50,000. The FAC further recommends the fund 
be reviewed in 2025 to ensure its effective use and the need for ongoing funding. 
The meeting noted Australia had agreed to fund half ($10,000) of the proposed update 
of NCNM estimates of unaccounted fishing mortality, and thanked Australia for this 
contribution. The FAC Chair encouraged other Members to consider voluntarily 
funding the other half of this work. 
The FAC considered funding for two ERSWG meetings planned for 2023. The 
meeting was advised that delays in providing necessary data meant that the planned 
face-to-face ERSWG meeting would now be held in 2024, resulting in savings to the 
2023 budget. It was noted an in-person technical workshop would be held early in 
2024, and a second, virtual, workshop held in mid-2024. It was noted that holding the 
second meeting in conjunction with the planned in-person regular ERSWG meeting 
may not possible if the ERSWG meeting is agreed and held in early 2024. 
The FAC supported the Technical Compliance Working group (TCWG) meeting be 
held in person prior to Compliance Committee in 2023 to further identify compliance 
risks to be included in the CCSBT Compliance Action Plan. 
The FAC recommends the Extended Commission agree to a budget for 2023 of 
$3,579,100.00 as set out at Annex B, noting this will require an increase in 
Membership contributions of around 3.5%. 
Indicative budgets for 2024 and 2025 
The FAC was also asked to consider indicative budgets for the two years beyond the 
upcoming budget, noting increases of around 5% in member contributions would 
likely be required for each year from 2024 to 2028 unless further reductions in 
expenses are achieved. Most expenses within the indicative budgets represent ongoing 
commitments. 
FAC Members expressed concern about the likely level of Membership contribution 
increases, noting these were not sustainable. FAC Members recommended the 
Extended Commission explore additional sources of income for the CCSBT and make 
efforts to reduce current levels of expenditure.  
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission note the indicative 2024 and 
2025 budgets as set out in Annex B.

*1: Australia is contributing $10,000 to the 2023 project for updated analysis of unaccounted mortality.
*3: The Contributions Stabilisation Fund is designed to reduced fluctuations in Member contributions from year to year. Negative entries 
are deposits to the fund and are treated as a reduction in available income for the relevant year. Positive entries are withdrawals from the 
fund and are treated as increased available income for that year.
*2: Interest on investments does not include interest earned from the staff liability fund.

Summary 
CCSBT29 requested Australia to provide a working paper detailing its trial of stereo 
video technology and, if successful, the steps to implement stereo video as a monitoring 
tool in its farm sector.

1 Trial of stereo video 
Australia’s stereo video trial has been delayed due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. However, the 
trial will commence in 2023 and CCSBT29 noted Australia’s update of the two-stage approach to 
the trial. 
1.1 
Work to date 
During 2021, Australia undertook an open tender process to procure a service provider of stereo 
video technology for the trial. The tender was open to international and domestic service 
providers. Prior to the tender, Australia undertook market research on stereo video technology, 
which included contacting all known potential suppliers of fully automated stereo video 
technology. The potential suppliers identified were informed by discussions with CCSBT 
Members, including Japan, New Zealand and the European Union, which sought advice on 
potential fit-for-purpose stereo video technologies, or stereo video technology providers in their 
respective countries.  
The successful tenderer has experience in using stereo video in the Mediterranean including in 
the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. 
Due to difficulties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including Australia’s border 
restrictions in late 2021 and early 2022, the trial did not start in the 2022 catching season 
(December – March) as planned. 
Despite this, Australia has continued to work with the tenderer on the approach and 
methodology and operational aspects of the trial. 
With Australia’s borders opening on 21 February this year, the trial is now able to commence 
during the 2023 catching season in January to March. 
Year one of the trial will test the accuracy of stereo video monitoring on SBT in Port Lincoln. 
This will allow the technology to be adapted to Australian-caught SBT and for the tenderer to 
understand the operational environment in Australia’s farms.  
Upon completion of year one of the trial, Australia will provide a report with the progress and 
results of year one of the trial and provide this to EC30.  
Informed by the results of year one, the field work for the trial will be completed in January – 
March 2024, to test stereo video technology in a commercially operational environment, 
including transfers from tow cages to farm pens and ability of the technology to operate within 
the oceanic and weather conditions of Australia’s SBT farms.  
Upon completion of year two of the trial, Australia will report the final results of the trial and, 
assuming the trial is successful, progress on implementation to EC31.

2 Implementation 
If the stereo video trial proves successful, Australia will be required to work through a number 
of additional steps to operationalise stereo video as a monitoring tool for its farm sector. While 
timing of implementation will need to be confirmed following the trial, based on Australia’s 
experience the three processes outlined below could take approximately 12 to 18 months in 
total to complete.  
2.1 
Monitoring program design: 
Subject to the success of the stereo video trial, Australia’s fisheries regulator, the Australian 
Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA), would be required to design a monitoring program 
largely informed by the outcomes of the stereo video trial. Factors to consider include, but are 
not limited to: program objectives, outcomes and requirements, data governance, cost 
implications, appropriate technology and systems, data collection and consideration, including 
length weight conversions and sampling regimes. 
2.2 
Legislative change: 
Australia has an existing legislative framework that governs how quota is decremented in the 
SBT farm sector and consideration will need to be given to the legislative implications of 
departing from its existing regime.  
Australia’s current monitoring regime is based on the 100 fish sample process and is considered 
within the existing legislative framework. 
Australia will need to consult broadly across government and seek legal advice on the 
implementation of legislating a new monitoring regime in the SBT farm sector. If implemented, 
Australia may need to undertake drafting and execution of new legislation and may also need to 
undertake a regulation impact statement, to determine how the increased regulation impacts 
stakeholders. It is likely the process for legislative change will involve statutory consultation 
timeframes. 
2.3 
Contractor engagement:  
AFMA would be required to undertake a formal tender process to approach the market to 
identify a supplier of SV services in the farm sector.  This would be followed by a tender 
evaluation and then a subsequent engagement of the successful tenderer.
