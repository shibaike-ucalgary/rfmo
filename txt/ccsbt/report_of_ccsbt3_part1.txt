Report of the Third Annual Meeting 
24 - 28 September 1996 
Canberra, Australia 
 
 
The representatives of the Governments of Japan, New Zealand and Australia met for 
the Third Annual Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna (CCSBT) from 24 to 28 September 1996. 
 
The meeting was chaired by Dr Alison Turner (Australia). Arthur Hore (New Zealand) 
was Vice-Chair. 
 
Agenda Item 1: 
Opening of Meeting 
 
The Chair welcomed observers from the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and the 
Indo-Pacific Tuna Programme (IPTP). Mr Morishita from Japan was also identified as 
the observer for the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas 
(ICCAT) and Mr Edwards from New Zealand was identified as the observer for the 
Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). 
 
The agreed agenda and list of participants for the meeting are at Attachments A and B, 
respectively. 
 
Rapporteurs were appointed as follows: for Japan, Mr Morishita and Mr Komatsu, for 
New Zealand Ms Robinson and for Australia Mr Hermes and Mr Cassells. 
 
Agenda Item 2: 
Opening Statements 
 
All parties recognised the need for the Commission to demonstrate its effectiveness as 
an international fisheries management organisation in ensuring a sustainable and 
responsibly managed fishery. All parties acknowledged the excellent support of the new 
Secretariat. 
 
2.1 Japan 
 
Mr Morimoto, head of the Japanese delegation, emphasised that the CCSBT should 
demonstrate to the world its usefulness and effectiveness as a responsible regional 
fisheries organisation by: 
a) 
presenting the detected recovering trends of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) stocks 
 
on the basis of the best currently available data; 
b) 
establishing and implementing appropriate conservation, management, and optimal 
 
utilisation measures; and 
c) 
managing its activities openly and equitably by respecting established rules. 
 
However, he expressed his deep regrets as the CCSBT had not fulfilled its responsibility 
as a regional fisheries organisation. This was because the CCSBT was in an impasse 
with regard to the SBT stock assessment and projection of future trends despite the long 
history of work by the scientists of Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. For the purpose 
 
2
of finding a way out from this difficult situation, Japan had proposed, amongst other 
things, an Experimental Fishing Program (EFP) at the last annual meeting of the 
CCSBT. 
 
Japan had proposed to discuss two items at the 1996 Scientific Committee of the 
CCSBT: Total Allowable Catch (TAC) recommendation and EFP including a Pilot 
Program. 
 
With regard to the TAC recommendation, Japan regretted that no discussion was 
conducted at the Scientific Committee meeting because of the shortage of time, 
although an agenda item had been established for the issue. However, judging from 
information presented at the Scientific Committee, showing the recovering trend of SBT 
stocks, Japan would propose to increase TAC at this annual meeting of the CCSBT. 
 
Japan also expressed serious concerns that the issue of EFP had not been taken up at the 
Scientific Committee because of objections from other parties. The failure to respect the 
timetable for EFP, agreed at the Special Meeting in May this year, would jeopardise the 
international credibility of the CCSBT. In an attempt to restore the situation, Japan had 
proposed to hold a workshop regarding EFP and its Pilot Program. Japan urged the 
CCSBT to agree on the proposal to hold the workshop at the earliest possible time. 
 
Japan expressed its regret that the Scientific Committee had failed to produce an agreed 
report to the Commission. Japan believed it was essential to establish open and 
equitable rules of procedures for the Scientific Committee to rectify and improve the 
past practices for report preparations, decision making, and other procedural matters. 
Japan commended the efforts of scientists who had continued to work on the report and 
had succeeded in finalising it. 
 
Noting the various international initiatives for the conservation and management of tuna 
stocks, including the UN Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks 
Agreement and others, Japan expressed its willingness to provide its best efforts and 
support to the CCSBT to attain its mission as a responsible regional fisheries 
organisation. Japan's opening statement is at Attachment C. 
 
2.2 New Zealand 
 
New Zealand recognised that over the last fifteen years, the three parties had developed 
a solid foundation for continued collaboration. This was evident in the Commission's 
willingness to work through several difficult issues over the last year, including the 
setting of a TAC and consideration of experimental fishing. However, despite making 
some progress in the recent Special Commission Meetings and the technical workshops, 
New Zealand believed a considerable amount of work was yet to be done in addressing 
a number of important issues still facing the Commission. 
 
New Zealand considered that the issues the Commission must resolve include: 
 
• 
stock status - the parental biomass is severely depleted and recent recruitment has 
 
yet to contribute to a significant rebuild of the parental stock. There is a need to 
 
3
 
take positive action to rebuild the parental biomass; 
 
• 
scientific process - the recent Scientific Committee meeting spent much time 
 
debating procedure. The Commission needs to determine solutions to these issues 
 
to allow effective functioning of the scientific meetings; 
 
• 
uncertainty - there is a need to develop a programme of work to resolve the 
 
sources of uncertainty in the stock assessment and recognise that although 
 
experimental fishing may be one component of such a programme, it will not 
 
resolve all or even necessarily the most important sources of uncertainty; 
 
• 
non-parties - steps need to be taken to encourage the accession or cooperation of 
 
non-parties to the Commission; and 
 
• 
international credibility - the Commission should recognise that there is 
 
increasing criticism from other entities about the status of the southern bluefin tuna 
 
stock. Steps should be taken to ensure the Commission is seen as a credible and 
 
responsible management body. 
 
New Zealand believed that the development of a management plan is fundamental to 
resolving many of the issues the Commission faces. If the Commission cannot at least 
develop a shared understanding of our objectives, New Zealand believes the 
Commission will flounder when trying to agree to more specific management actions.  
New Zealand's objective for this meeting is for the Commission to develop an agreed 
programme of work designed to maximise the use of our joint resources to address the 
key issues outlined above. New Zealand's opening statement is at Attachment D. 
 
2.3 Australia 
 
Australia stressed its complete commitment to the successful operation of the 
Commission, and through that, to effective international management of the southern 
bluefin tuna fishery. 
 
Australia expressed its regret that demands for change to the established and practicable 
scientific processes of the Commission had affected the Scientific Committee's capacity 
to conduct the comprehensive stock assessment so vital to the functioning of the 
Commission. 
 
Australia considered the credibility, competence and calibre of the Commission were at 
stake and urged the Commission to embrace sound standards of fisheries management 
in a way which genuinely reflects the uncertainties in the stock assessment and the 
current status of SBT stocks. The SBT stock is depleted to levels far below the 'safe' 
1980 level of parental biomass and to levels which represent an alarmingly small 
proportion of virgin biomass. 
 
Australia indicated its willingness to explore ways to address the current difficulties 
facing the Commission. This includes ensuring the integrity of the Commission's 
scientific work and producing assessments which can stand up to international scrutiny.  
 
4
Australia sought a clear separation of the scientific and management processes.  
Australia stressed that the Commission had already agreed that additional catch, even 
for experimental fishing, would only be contemplated if it could be shown not to 
jeopardise stock recovery. 
 
The Commission's job is to identify the best way to deal with differences and 
uncertainties, to strengthen the co-operative framework built over the last 15 years, and 
to secure a healthy future for parties' SBT industries by providing for stock recovery to 
safe and sustainable levels. Australia's opening statement is at Attachment E. 
 
 
2.4 Other States and Entities 
 
 
2.4.1 
The Republic of Korea 
 
The representative of the Republic of Korea acknowledged the importance of  the 
CCSBT in the management of SBT stocks and welcomed the CCSBT's recent initiatives 
in the field of the conservation and management of the stocks. He noted the Republic of 
Korea's active participation in various international fisheries organisations and its 
domestic fisheries policy promoting sustainable management. 
 
Korea would cooperate with the CCSBT in the conservation and management of SBT 
and, in principle, would be willing to consider joining the CCSBT. However, there was 
no consensus in the Republic of Korea on how to join the organisation because the catch 
allocation for new entrants would be so small that the Korean fishing industry would 
not be able to sustain their fishing business. Korea asked the CCSBT to understand the 
difficult situation and requested to have a second thought on the catch allocation system 
for new entrants. 
 
 
2.4.2 
The Republic of Indonesia 
 
Indonesia confirmed that it had received the CCSBT letter requesting Indonesia to join 
the organisation. Although Indonesia regards the CCSBT as useful for the conservation 
and management of SBT, it would like to remain as a non-convention member, as in the 
last year. The representative of Indonesia recognised the lack of sufficient fisheries 
information in his country and expressed Indonesia's commitment to study the situation 
seriously. He emphasised the importance of cooperation from the members of the 
CCSBT to improve the situation. 
 
 
2.4.3 
Taiwan 
 
The representative from Taiwan advised that Taiwan had assigned one scientist to study 
SBT matters along with a budget of US$ 130,000 for research. With this new resource, 
Taiwan would be able to send its representatives to the next CCSBT Scientific 
Committee meeting and enhance monitoring of its SBT catches. Taiwan has also 
introduced a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) to collect catch and other fisheries data 
and provide daily reporting of catch statistics to authorities. Taiwan hopes to obtain 
more accurate data through this system. 
 
5
 
 
2.4.4 
IOTC-FAO-IPTP 
 
The representative from the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), who also 
represented Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and IPTP, stated that the first 
meeting of IOTC will be held in December 1996 and that IOTC would take over the 
functions of IPTP once it became fully operational. IOTC hoped that the cooperative 
relationship between the CCSBT and IOTC would be further strengthened, and 
extended an invitation to the CCSBT to attend its first meeting as an observer. 
 
Agenda Item 3: 
Relation to other Bodies 
 
3.1 CITES - including action by IUCN relating to the listing of SBT 
 
The Commission noted that the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals would be 
released in October 1996 and would include southern bluefin tuna as critically 
endangered. The recommendation to list SBT as critically endangered included a caveat 
which recognised that the listing criteria do not always lead to equally robust 
assessments of extinction risk which depend on the life history of the species, 
particularly those with high reproductive potential. 
 
Although the IUCN workshop which developed the recommendation to list SBT 
included scientific representatives from Australia and Japan, the Commission noted that 
it had little opportunity to provide input. Although there are no direct management or 
legislative implications of the listing, the Commission agreed that the listing was likely 
to have political implications. More specifically, the Commission noted that a number of 
entities viewed SBT as under threat and they would not hesitate to use the Convention 
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) as a 
vehicle, irrespective of the damage to SBT fishing industries. 
 
The Commission recognised the need to ensure that the relevant organisations and 
entities were fully aware of the work being done by the Commission and agreed on 
the following course of action: 
 
a) 
the Secretariat will make formal representation to the IUCN, including the 
 
Species  Survival Commission, seeking agreement for the CCSBT to be 
 
represented in technical meetings where SBT and related issues are to be 
 
considered. This includes any review of the Red List Criteria for marine 
 
species; 
 
b) advise the Species Survival Commission of the Commission's views about the 
 
listing of southern bluefin tuna on the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Animals 
 
and the criteria used; 
 
c) 
the Secretariat will coordinate the preparation of an information paper setting 
 
out the CCSBT position on SBT and action taken to facilitate stock recovery. 
 
The paper should include reference to the qualifications attached to the IUCN 
 
listing. This paper would be used for distribution to the IUCN, interest groups 
 
6
 
and the media as required; 
 
d) the Commission will begin work to develop and document an effective 
 
management strategy to rebuild the southern bluefin tuna. This would be a 
 
component of a process to demonstrate the competence of the CCSBT; 
 
e) 
the Secretariat will make formal representation to the CITES Secretariat 
 
informing them of the CCSBT role in SBT management and requesting that 
 
the CCSBT be advised, as soon as practical, of any recommendations to list 
 
SBT or Atlantic bluefin tuna under CITES; and 
 
f) 
the Secretariat to coordinate the preparation, by CCSBT members, of a draft 
 
communication which could be submitted to countries or entities which may 
 
seek consultations on a CITES listing of SBT, and to CITES should an 
 
application be made for a listing. The CCSBT is to study the approach 
 
adopted by ICCAT members in relation to proposals to list Northern Bluefin 
 
Tuna on CITES. 
 
3.2 IOTC  
 
Mr Anganuzzi, the representative from the IOTC and the IPTP, reported that the IOTC 
had yet to develop a position about its association with the CCSBT and jurisdiction for 
the management of SBT. However, he reported that the IPTP viewed the CCSBT as the 
organisation responsible for the management of SBT. 
 
The Commission noted that the IOTC would be meeting in December 1996 and the 
importance of establishing a relationship with the IOTC to confirm that the 
CCSBT is the most appropriate organisation to manage SBT. 
 
The Commission endorsed the following course of action: 
 
a) the Acting Executive Secretary would attend the next meeting of the IOTC as 
an observer and seek leave to present a statement on behalf of the CCSBT; 
 
b) the statement to be presented would be coordinated by the Secretariat and 
developed cooperatively by the parties. The statement would advocate the 
CCSBT's primacy and competence for the management of SBT. It would 
suggest that the IOTC and the CCSBT develop a more formal arrangement 
for cooperation on issues including: 
i) 
data exchange; 
ii) management measures adopted by the respective organisations;  
iii) reciprocal attendance at meetings; and 
iv) recognition of the competence of the CCSBT to manage SBT. 
 
3.3 ICCAT  
 
Japan, who had represented the CCSBT at the last meeting of ICCAT, outlined the 
current arrangements, whereby: 
 
7
 
a) 
ICCAT recognises that the CCSBT manages SBT; and 
 
b) the two organisations have agreed to exchange information on management actions 
taken with respect to SBT. 
 
The Commission noted that representations to ICCAT, or other international 
organisations in which the Commission may participate, should be collaboratively 
developed by the parties.  
 
The Commission agreed that the Secretariat would determine the process within 
which the Commission could provide information to the management and 
technical meetings of ICCAT and that the Acting Executive Secretary would 
participate as an observer at the next ICCAT meeting. 
 
3.4 CCAMLR 
 
Mr Edwards from New Zealand, who was representing CCAMLR, noted that the issue 
of the incidental mortality of seabirds is an area of mutual interest between the two 
organisations. In his role as a CCAMLR representative, Mr Edwards has undertaken to 
prepare a report about the Ecologically Related Species (ERS) issues in the CCSBT.  
New Zealand will coordinate the preparation of this report through the Secretariat and in 
collaboration with the other parties. 
 
The Commission agreed that Mr Neil Hermes from Australia would represent the 
CCSBT as an observer at the next CCAMLR meeting to be held 21 October - 1 
November 1996. 
 
Agenda Item 4: 
Administrative Arrangements 
 
4.1 Appointment of Executive Secretary 
 
Two meetings of Heads of Delegations were held to finalise the short list for the 
position of Executive Secretary and agree to processes to complete the selection process.  
A short list of five candidates was selected and further information, including referee's 
reports, on the candidates will be obtained. Interviews will be conducted by a panel, 
convened by Dr Alison Turner, comprising a nominee from each member country.  
Furthermore, procedures were agreed which will ensure that this selection process for 
the Executive Secretary, and the subsequent selection of the Deputy Executive Secretary, 
result in one Japanese national and one Australian or New Zealand national in these 
positions. 
 
4.2 Review of 1996 Budget, Draft 1997 Budget 
 
The Commission endorsed the draft budget at Attachment F, subject to the 
following variations, and on the basis that the additional estimated expenditure of 
$25,000 be met from the reserve funds carried over from 1996:

The ad-hoc finance group recognised that the Commission will determine in the future 
whether or not, and the extent to which, the Secretariat shall develop a capacity in data 
and statistics compilation. However, in order to make this decision, the Commission 
will need information and advice from the Secretariat and the Scientific Committee.  
Action to develop that advice was endorsed by the Commission as part of the Program 
of Work for 1997. 
 
Terms of Reference for the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
The group considered it appropriate for the Secretariat to consult with international 
fishery management organisations on the existing functions and programme of work of 
their finance committee. The Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee, 
with the Secretariat, should develop draft Terms of Reference for the Committee 
for consideration intersessionally. Terms of Reference shall be agreed 
intersessionally to facilitate the operation of the Committee from 1997. 
 
Chair of Finance and Administration Committee 
 
The Commission agreed that Japan would be the initial Chair of the Finance and 
Administration Committee for two years. 
 
9
 
4.3 Amendment to Staff Regulations Relating to Social Security Contributions  
 
The Commission endorsed amendments to Staff Regulation 8.1 by replacing the 
words up to a maximum of 14% with up to the maximum percentage applying in the 
United Nations Secretariat from time to time. 
 
4.4 Adoption of Headquarters Agreement 
 
As raised in a letter to the Chair dated 12 September 1996, an issue of domestic legal 
uncertainty has resulted in Australia being advised to delay the planned signature of the 
Draft CCSBT Headquarters Agreement. 
 
Australia noted that this situation has no effect whatsoever on the day-to-day functions 
of the Commission Secretariat, and only relates to the question of an exemption from 
sales tax on goods purchased by the Commission in Australia. All of the other rights and 
obligations of the Commission in Australia had already been fully secured under 
relevant Australian law. 
 
Australia said it was currently awaiting legal advice which has been sought in relation 
to the sales tax issue. Once this advice has been received, Australia would be better able 
to advise the Commission as to when the Australian Government is likely to be in a 
position to formally approve signature of the Agreement. 
 
It was agreed that the Headquarters Agreement be signed intersessionally as soon 
as possible after the relevant domestic legal issues have been dealt with and 
Australian Government approval obtained. 
 
Agenda Item 5: 
Review of SBT Fisheries 
 
It was agreed that for future meetings of the Commission all members (and 
relevant invited observers) be asked to submit a brief written report under 
standard headings for this item. Reports would need to be submitted in sufficient 
time to allow both English and Japanese language versions to be distributed by the 
start of the meeting. 
 
The agenda item would then consist of questions and discussion, after members had had 
an opportunity to consider all written fishery reports. 
 
5.1 Japan 
 
Japan reported its 1995 catch at 5,866 tonnes out of the national quota of 6,065 tons. 
More detailed information about the Japanese fisheries is at Attachment G. 
 
Japan provided its SBT import statistics for information (Attachment H). 
 
When queried by Australia on what the assumed level of mortality was of non-retained 
SBT and how this was calculated, Japan noted that it assumed a survival rate of 55% of 
 
10
those small SBT returned to the sea and as a result, assumed 45% mortality which was 
counted against Japan's quota. Japan indicated that it used the index of life status at 
catch that had been used by Australian observers and consideration of the trauma of 
capture to derive these assumptions. 
 
Australia queried what the total weights of retained and non-retained fish were, what 
percentage level of observer coverage was achieved, how small fish were landed on 
board and if the Japanese catch of 5,866 was whole weight. 
 
Japan responded that the weight of dead fish in the non-retained component was 711 
tonnes and that they were included in the stated catch of 5,866 tonnes caught, which 
was stated to be whole weight. Japan indicated that 16 observer cruises had been 
undertaken, 11 by Japanese observers and 5 by Australian observers, with 890 and 258 
sea days respectively for approximately 10 percent coverage. Japan also noted that the 
average weight of non-retained fish was 20.1 kg. 
 
Australia expressed its concern on the basis for the Japanese assumptions on 
survivability, also noting that a much higher figure than 55% had been suggested by 
Japan in the Scientific Committee. Australia also noted that high seas observers had 
reported that a high proportion of fish were gaffed by Japanese fishers when landing 
small SBT. Japan maintained that non-retained small fish were not gaffed. 
 
In response to Australia's request for further clarification about the calculation of the 
55% survival rate figure and tonnage of non-retained fish, Japan agreed to provide a 
written explanation as soon as possible after the meeting. 
 
New Zealand noted that it was unaware of the Commission formulating any policy that 
would support the releasing of small SBT and suggested that this be discussed in more 
detail. New Zealand suggested that there was a need for the Commission to develop a 
policy on non-retention of fish that would apply uniformly. 
 
Japan noted that for its 1996/97 season total vessels numbers and areas of operation 
would be adjusted, partly as the delays in setting the 1995/96 quota had caused Japanese 
vessels some disruption. 
 
Japan advised that its fishing vessels intend to continue releasing SBT under 25 kg 
during the 1996/97 fishing season. 
 
5.2 New Zealand 
 
New Zealand reported recent trends in the New Zealand SBT fishery. They noted that 
Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) in the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone had 
declined in recent years and that there was some doubt whether the recent increase in 
juvenile abundance would contribute significantly to the rebuild of the parental biomass.  
New Zealand announced that it has reduced its voluntary catch limit by 16 tonnes for 
the 1995/96 season, because of excess catch in 1994/95. New Zealand explained to the 
Commission that the reduction from the following year's quota is an appropriate 
management response to overcatch. New Zealand stated that its overcatch was the result 
 
11
of a number of circumstances, particularly a dramatic increase in the domestic fleet and 
inadequate monitoring. In no way would this principle sanction the deliberate or 
planned intent to overcatch a country's catch limit in any year. New Zealand's statement 
is at Attachment I. 
 
5.3 Australia 
 
Australia presented an overview of trends in its SBT fishery, elaborating on some 
aspects in response to questions from Japan. Major changes had occurred in the 
Australian SBT fisheries during the 1990s. Whereas virtually no Australian quota was 
taken by longline for most of the 1980s, more than half of the Australian 5,265 tonnes 
quota was longlined annually from 1990 to 1994 (predominantly by joint venture 
operations but about 300 tonnes were taken by domestic small-vessel longlining off 
NSW, TAS and SA). Australia's statement is at Attachment J. 
 
Australia advised that no additional quota was allocated to extend the 1994/1995 fishing 
season. 
 
Japan noted that Australia had unilaterally decided to extend its 1994-95 quota year by 
six weeks, when it might more appropriately have forgone the uncaught tonnage of what 
the Commission determines as a year's allocation. It questioned the procedures adopted 
for estimating tonnages of farm fish catches to debit against quota, highlighting the 
likely high mortality of purse seined fish and emphasising the need for observers on the 
vessels. Australia advised that all transfers were monitored by compliance staff, the fish 
counted using under-water video and sampled for weight to develop a tonnage estimate.  
Japan asked about mortality rates and weight loss of SBT which may occur during 
capture and transfer of SBT from purse seine nets to tuna farms. Australia noted that 
management conditions required fishermen to report all mortalities occurring at capture 
and prior to transfer to rearing cages for debit against quota. Australia noted that dead 
fish were removed from cages during the towing process and that the weight of dead 
fish were debited against quota. Mortality during towing and transferring was reported 
as 1.4% in 1995 and 1.5% in 1996. Australia undertook to provide more information on 
these mortality rates. 
 
Although it might be two to three weeks between capture of fish on the fishing grounds 
and their transport to Port Lincoln, feeding in tow cages commenced soon after capture, 
so that fish might even have gained weight prior to sampling to estimate debits against 
quota. 
 
5.4  Other States and Entities 
 
 
5.4.1 
Taiwan 
 
Taiwan presented a document describing its SBT fisheries (Attachment K). Estimated 
SBT landings by Taiwan were 1,003 tonnes in 1994 and 1,447 tonnes in 1995 (whole 
weight). Taiwan announced that it would restrict future catches to no higher than the 
1995 level. 
 
 
12
 
5.4.2 
The Republic of Korea 
 
The Republic of Korea reported an increasing trend of its SBT catches for the last five 
years, reaching 650 tonnes by September 1996. The parties requested the Republic of 
Korea to restrain its catches and asked for some additional information about the 
Korean fisheries. 
 
The Commission agreed that the Chair would write to the Government of Korea, 
seeking information on their SBT fishery, which the Republic of Korea was unable 
to provide at this meeting. 
 
Information to be requested in the letter would include: 
a) 
information on SBT catch in 1994 and 1995; 
b) 
number and type of boats that catch SBT, and where these boats operate; 
c) 
percentage of SBT catch which is sold to Japan compared to domestic use; 
d) 
where catch is landed; 
e) 
how the arrangements for monitoring catch levels operate; and 
f) 
the Government of the Republic of Korea's intention for future catch levels and 
whether it intends to restrain or limit future catch. 
 
 
5.4.3 
 The Republic of Indonesia 
 
Indonesia was not in a position to report about its SBT catch but was willing to consider 
recommendations and advice from the Commission. 
 
The Commission agreed that the Chair would also write to the Government of 
Indonesia, seeking information on the Indonesian SBT fishery, which was unable 
to be provided at this meeting. 
 
Information to be requested in the letter would include: 
a) 
estimated Indonesian catch of SBT in 1993, 1994 and 1995, the estimates for 
earlier years, if available, and indicating whether the estimates are for processed or 
whole weight; 
b) if catch statistics are reported in whole weight, the conversion factor used to 
convert processed to whole weights; 
c) 
where the Indonesian catch of SBT is landed; 
d) percentage of the Indonesian SBT catch exported and percentage retained in 
Indonesia; 
e) 
how much Indonesian longline effort (number of hooks and operations) is 
expended below 30ºs and what is the distribution by ocean and area; 
f) 
the distribution of SBT catch by ocean and area (5º square if possible), and by 
month; 
g) how the Indonesian catch and effort statistics are compiled and collected and 
monitoring systems in place to establish these statistics; and 
h) information on the size (length or weight) distribution of the Indonesian catch, and 
the size distribution. 
 
 
 
13
5.5 High Seas SBT Fishery - ITQ System 
 
The Australian industry presented a paper on the use of Individual Transferable Quotas 
(ITQs) which is set out at Attachment L. 
 
The Australian industry representative was asked if the system meant that ITQs could be 
traded between countries. He replied that this was not the case. Japan indicated that it 
had no intention of introducing an ITQ system in the near future because of several 
problems with the system from the viewpoint of fisheries management. For example, 
monitoring and enforcement of compliance would, in Japan's view, entail a large cost.  
There would be an incentive for high grading. 
 
In response to a question from Japan, as to whether the Australian Government 
endorsed the proposal for ITQs, Australia indicated in the affirmative and advised that it 
would be pleased if Japan would consider using an ITQ system in its SBT fishery as it 
thought it might help Japan address some of the problems occurring in its fishery. 
 
Agenda Item 6: 
FAO - Coordinating Working Party on Statistics 
 
The Commission recognised the utility of sending a CCSBT observer to the 17th 
meeting of the FAO - Coordinating Working Party (CWP) on Statistics to be held at 
Hobart, Australia, in February 1997. The observer would be either the Executive 
Secretary or a member of the parties, who would report back the Commission on the 
costs and benefits for the CCSBT to join the CWP as a member. The Commission would 
consider its future approach to the CWP at the next annual meeting. 
 
Agenda Item 7: 
Matter Arising from Previous Meeting - CCSBT Position on Kyoto 
Declaration and Other International Fishing Initiatives 
 
The Commission considered an approach it may adopt in relation to other international 
organisations, other agreements and treaties, and instruments such as the Kyoto 
Declaration. 
 
With regard to a general approach to various other international fisheries initiatives, the 
parties recognised the usefulness of the paper prepared by the Secretariat (Attachment 
M) and agreed to its recommendations: 
 
a) that members of the Commission advise the Secretariat of relevant 
inter-governmental and other international organisations with which they are 
associated; 
 
b) that the Secretariat identify other inter-governmental or international 
organisations and international instruments which could affect the 
conservation and management of southern bluefin tuna; 
 
c) 
that the Secretariat report to the Commission on the relevant organisations 
and international instruments which could affect the conservation and 
management of southern bluefin tuna and include recommendations on 
 
14
whether the Commission should: 
(i) take no action,  
(ii) monitor activities of the organisation, 
(iii) seek to collaborate with the organisation, which could include data 
(iv) exchange and inviting observers to Commission meetings, 
(v) seek to enter into formal arrangements with the organisation, or  
(vi) adopt all or part of the provisions of relevant international instruments. 
 
The Commission concurred on the need for the forthcoming World Food Summit to 
recognise the contribution which sustainable fisheries production can make to world 
food security. In this regard they welcomed the Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action as 
a means of drawing the Summit's attention to the importance of fisheries. Australia and 
New Zealand noted that they had been amongst a group of four countries which had 
lodged a statement expressing reservations about aspects of the Declaration and Action 
Plan at the time when it was adopted. 
 
Agenda Item 8: 
Ecologically Related Species 
 
Report from the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
 
The Commission noted that the ERS Working Group had had its first meeting in 
December 1995 and thanked New Zealand for its efforts in arranging and providing 
excellent administrative support to the meeting. 
 
It was noted that the report was a consensus report of the ERS Working Group meeting 
and as such was an adopted report of the Commission. 
 
The Commission accepted Australia's offer to host the next meeting of the Working 
Group and decided that the ERS Working Group would meet in early 1997. Attention 
should be given to those issues identified in the 1995 ERS Working Group report (for 
example, the questions from 1995 and Appendix 7 to the report). 
 
New Zealand and Australia were keen to maintain progress in work on ERS and drafted 
a set of questions and future actions which they had derived from the 1995 ERS 
Working Group Report. Japan considered that these questions and actions had been 
inappropriately derived, and that the ERS Working Group should first complete work 
which in Japan's view had yet to be addressed in response to the set of questions from 
the Commission in 1995. In the absence of agreement on how best to proceed with the 
conclusions and recommendations of the ERS Working Group Report it was agreed 
that the matter would be considered further at the resumed third Annual Meeting 
of the Commission. 
 
Agenda Item 9: 
Report from Scientific Committee 
 
9.1 Status of SBT Stocks 
 
 
9.1.1 Chair's Summary 
 
The Commission agreed to a proposal from the Chair that a brief summary presentation 
 
15
of the report of the Scientific Committee be made by the Chair of the Scientific 
Committee, and that the head scientist from each delegation would have the opportunity 
to provide a brief statement. It was agreed that discussion under this agenda item would 
be limited to these presentations, which are summarised below. The Report of the 
Scientific Committee is at Attachment N. 
 
New biological information 
 
a) 
age at first reproduction could be older than the age 8 years presently used in 
assessments; 
b) present method of calculating age from length under-estimates age for fish older 
than 7 years; 
c) 
natural mortality of young fish is relatively high; 
 
d) review of conversion factors for calculating whole weight from processed weight 
found that the previously used factor was unsatisfactory. A new relationship for 
Japan style processing for the frozen fish market is given in the report. Japan had 
later asserted that the meeting concluded that further investigation on this matter 
was required. Australia and New Zealand noted that no short comings of the 
analysis or dissent with the results had been raised by any party during the meeting. 
 
Catches 
 
a) 
non-party catch in 1995 was 2,588t. This is the highest level yet recorded. 
 
CPUE 
 
a) 
Figure 1 in the Scientific Committee report gives standardised CPUE adopted for 
the years assessment; 
 
b) 
Interpretations range from: 
(i) substantial increase in the abundance of 4 year olds in the mid to late 1980's 
and 1990's, giving rise later to an increase in 6-7 year olds and some increase 
of 8-11 year olds by 1995; 12+ year olds remained at about the same 
abundance; 
(ii) an increase in the abundance of 4 year olds in the early 1990's then decrease 
again, giving rise later to a slight increase in 6-7 year olds, and a continued 
slow decline of 8 to 11 year olds and 12+ year olds; 
(iii) with B ratio providing one intermediate interpretation. 
 
c) 
This range of interpretations was carried into the VPAs and projections; 
 
d) 
The main uncertainties identified in the VPA's were: 
(i) CPUE interpretation; 
(ii) natural mortality rate; 
(iii) emphasis given to juvenile CPUE; 
(iv) inclusion or exclusion of recent fishing mortality estimate from tagging; 
(vi) method of calculating the number of fish 12 years and older in the first year of 
 
16
analysis; 
(vii) inclusion or exclusion of the requirement that the level of fishing mortality is 
related to the level of fishing effort. 
 
e) 
Different groups of scientists gave different weight to options within these 
uncertainties. These weights were used to calculate weighted means for various 
measures of stock status; 
 
f) 
Across all weightings by all groups of scientists: 
(i) the parental biomass in 1995 was 25-39% of that in 1980; 
(ii) the parental biomass in 1995 was 5-8% of that in 1960. 
 
g) For present catches, the probability of recovery to the 1980 parental biomass by 
2020 was: 
(i) Australia: 
 
15% 
Australian documents also provided an assessment giving a 36% probability of 
recovery, which they considered a more reasonable estimate of recovery 
probability. 
 
(ii) Japan: 
 
 
79% 
Additional Japanese analyses with a slightly different VPA structure gave 20%, 
which they considered inconclusive until the cause of the sensitivity is further 
examined 
 
(iii) New Zealand:  
29% 
 
(iv) Ext.Scientists: 
69% 
 
h) Projections were also conducted under illustrative EFP catch scenarios. These catch 
scenarios were: 
(i) increase of 3,000 tonnes for 3 years, then return to current levels; 
(ii) increase of 3,000 tonnes for 3 years, followed by a decrease to 3,000 tonnes 
below current levels for 3 years, then a return to present levels; and 
(iii) permanent increase of 3,000 tonnes. 
 
i) 
Detailed results of these recovery probabilities under these catch scenarios are 
provided in the Scientific Committee report. However the main conclusions were: 
 
(i) Across all the different analyses and weightings the recovery probability of a 3 
year catch increase followed by a 3 year decrease was only 1-4 percent lower 
than the recovery probability under current catches. Japan considered this to 
be a negligible effect on the stock. Australia and New Zealand noted that a 
marginal change in the probability of recovery does not provide an adequate 
measure of overall risk and that the absolute level of the probability of 
recovery must be considered; 
 
(ii) Across all the different analyses and weightings the probability of recovery 
decreased substantially for a permanent increase of 3,000t compared to the 
 
17
probability under current catches; 
 
(iii) Australia and New Zealand noted that in the absence of management decision 
rules, reduction of the catch after the introduction of EFP could be problematic, 
and so the permanent increase of 3000t provides the most reasonable measure 
of risk. Japan did not agree to use the permanent increase of 3,000t as the most 
reasonable measure of risk; 
 
(iv) Australia and New Zealand noted that the absolute level of the recovery 
probability under their weighting schemes was low under current catches and 
the EFP catch scenarios considered; 
 
(v) Australia and New Zealand noted that in the past several years the projections 
have been overly optimistic and expressed concern that the present results 
could also be overly optimistic. Japan noted that the comparison of projections 
in previous year was also influenced by change in the assessment methods 
used and that the results should not be considered to reflect the change of 
overall estimate of risk. 
 
Each party used the results of these analyses to provide detailed answers to the 
questions posed by the Commission to the Scientific Committee, and these answers are 
contained in the report. 
 
Other matters 
 
a) 
The ERS report was passed through the Scientific Committee to the Commission; 
b) The Scientific Committee provided a proposal for sampling and archiving of 
otoliths, as requested by Commission (Attachment 9 of the report); 
c) 
The data and document exchange prior to meeting was not implemented perfectly 
but it was useful, and it should be continued and improved. Some suggest 
improvements are: 
(i) an extra week be allowed for document writing; 
(ii) agreed mechanism of exchange be identified. 
 
During his presentation, but not as part of the Scientific report, Dr Sainsbury noted that 
party catches in 1995 and used in the 1996 assessment did not include the 711t of 
non-retained fish, thought to have later died, as reported by Japan to the 1996 
Commission meeting. 
 
 
9.1.2 Japanese Statement 
 
Japan made the following statement: 
 
Japan expressed its regret and concern that the results of two VPAs presented to the 
Scientific Committee were not fully comparable. One reason for this was that the 
cross-validation process for Japan's VPA was not completed. Japan assured the 
Commission that it will continue efforts to pursue this issue. However, the other reason 
was that the newly introduced factors by Australia could not be incorporated into 
 
18
Japanese VPA during the limited time available at the Committee. In order to prevent 
this from happening again in the future, Japan proposed that newly implemented inputs 
and/or structures would only be adopted as common methods after thorough reviews of 
one year by all parties. 
 
It was noted that this was an agreed rule in the ICCAT and that the CCSBT/SC also had 
applied the same rule when changing the interpretation regarding growth. 
 
Japan also argued against the use of overly conservative measures in risk assessment. 
Utilisation of natural resources is always associated with some risks in stock status. It is 
rather important and productive to take appropriate action promptly when an adverse 
signal is recognised. It regarded the estimation of risk from a permanent additional 
catch scenario as neither appropriate nor realistic for measuring the risk of an 
experimental fishing program where the immediate reduction of catch level was 
considered as possible action whenever necessary. Excessive conservatism of not 
accepting any additional risk under any circumstance will be adverse for the 
achievement of maximum sustainable use of resources which is clearly stipulated, in 
Japan's view, in the CCSBT Convention. 
 
 
9.1.3 New Zealand Statement 
 
New Zealand made the following statement: 
 
a) 
There is a mix of positive and negative signals. CPUE is similar to that seen in the 
mid 1980's; 
 
b) CPUE of juveniles is still a hopeful sign at present but presents equivocal signals.  
There are some sightings of small fish off New South Wales and New Zealand not 
seen for many years. However, these hopeful signs are few and there is little 
evidence that the higher abundance of juveniles in recent years is contributing 
appreciably to the parental stock (8+ year olds); 
 
c) 
The SBT parental stock based on CPUE and VPA appears to have stabilised at 
about 25-28% of the 1980 levels over the past 2-3 years, this is about 6% of the 
abundance in 1960 (the fishery started in about 1952); 
 
d) Stock projections have been found to have been overly optimistic for the past 
several years, suggesting that the stock is worse off than has been previously 
believed. Given this, the projected probability of recovery for the parental biomass 
to 1980 levels is worrying since it is only 29% and the probability that the parental 
stock will stay the same or decline is 57%. Current parental biomass is likely to be 
5-8% of what it was in the first decade of the fishery. These estimates are also 
likely to be optimistic; 
 
e) 
Preliminary data from 1996 generally show a worsening of CPUE trends for 
juvenile and adults off South Africa, the Tasman Sea off Australia and in the New 
Zealand EEZ; 
 
 
19
f) 
In summary, the SBT stock continues to show a mixture of signs but there is little 
or no evidence that the parental stock is rebuilding as a result of the stronger than 
average year classes of the late 1980s and quota restrictions. The parental stock 
continues at very low levels and the probability of parental biomass levels 
recovering to 1980s levels by 2020 is low, the probability that the parental stock 
will remain at its current low level or decline further is moderate (57%). 
 
9.1.4 Australian Statement 
 
Australia made the following statement: 
 
a) 
The use of the historical conversion factor for going from processed to whole 
weight will result, and has resulted in, the total weight of the longline catch being 
underestimated; 
 
b) The results of the collaborative juvenile tagging program provided significant and 
improved information on natural and fishing mortality rates for young fish and this 
tended to give a more optimistic estimate of recent recruitment than if this 
information is not used. Expansion of the tagging program to the high seas and 
across a wider range of age classes could provide the best approach for reducing 
the uncertainty in the present assessment; 
 
c) 
The Scientific Committee developed a proposal for collection and archiving of hard 
parts which Australian scientists consider extremely important for the Commission 
to implement; 
 
d) The Scientific Committee agreed that the recent catch rate data for NZ and 
Tasmania suggests a reduced abundance of young age groups in these areas in the 
last few years. Concerns exist that the high catch rates of juveniles for late 1980 
and early 1990 cohorts has declined rapidly as these cohorts aged; 
 
e) 
Uncertainty associated with Japanese high seas non-retention and the changes in 
non-retention practices introduced in 1995 have increased and will continue to 
increase the uncertainty in the assessments particularly with respect to recent 
recruitment trends; 
 
f) 
The 1995 parental biomass is considerably lower than the 1980 level and the 
continued low level is a cause for serious concern because the 1980 level 
corresponds to commonly used thresholds for biologically safe parental biomass; 
 
g) The Scientific Committee failed to agree on the range of uncertainty that needed to 
be considered (i.e. step 1). In particular, Japan's weighted VPA and projection 
results were based on only 10% of the 216 VPA's agreed on by the Scientific 
Committee - 90% were excluded because Japan considered these to be outside the 
range of plausible hypotheses while all other groups consider them to be within the 
range of plausible hypotheses; 
 
h) For the 10% of the agreed on VPA's that Japan considered to be within the 
 
20
plausible range of hypotheses, projection results were highly sensitive to slight 
technical differences in the VPA models. Based on the results produced by Japan 
with the Japanese weightings, the estimated probability. of recovery by 2020 was 
20%. Results produced by Australia, based on a slightly different technical model 
but for the same basic set of VPA's and Japanese weighting's, yield a probability of 
79%. This sensitivity is largely due to the specific VPA model and the sensitivity 
indicates that the set of VPA's given high weights by Japan (and thus their 
projection results) do not provide a robust measure of the status of the SBT 
resource; 
 
i) 
Interpretations of the current status of the stock range from significant rebuilding of 
juveniles that will soon lead to increases in the parental biomass through to 
interpretations that weaker and uneven rebuilding of juveniles will lead to further 
declines in parental biomass under current catches. Given the range of uncertainty, 
neither interpretation can be excluded. After weighting the various interpretations, 
Australian scientists consider that the expected outcome under current catches is 
continued low parental biomass. At present there is no clear scientific basis for 
definitive conclusions about the sustainability of current catch levels. 
 
Agenda Item 10: Research and Monitoring Programs 
 
10.1 Implementation of Article 8 (1) of the Convention, Data Collection  
 
The Commission agreed on the data collection and exchange program at 
Attachment O and agreed that this program would apply in future years unless 
otherwise agreed. 
 
The Commission agreed that proposals for the collection and management of data 
relating to Southern Bluefin Tuna be developed for consideration by the 
Commission by: 
 
a) the Secretariat assisting the Scientific Committee by undertaking  an analysis 
of data collection arrangements in relevant international organisations and the 
costs to those organisations. The Secretariat should confine its work to looking 
at existing arrangements in relevant international organisations. The 
Secretariat should also propose policies necessary to ensure confidentially of 
information; 
 
b) requesting the next Scientific Committee meeting to examine the: 
(i) nature and character of data, statistics and information to be collected (eg. 
catch/effort data, size, estimated age, tagging, Real Time Monitoring 
Programme (RTMP), recruitment, monitoring and research data); 
(ii) appropriate methods of compilation and management etc; 
(iii) required facilities and equipment such as Personal Computer, hard disc, 
software; 
(iv) required manpower; 
(v) estimated cost of the proposals; and 
 
 
21
c) 
recognising that more work may be needed through other channels 
intersessionally. 
 
New Zealand and Australia acknowledged the functions described in the Convention 
regarding data collection but considered that this role could be undertaken at a range of 
levels and stressed that a decision had yet to be taken on the role of the Secretariat in 
data collection and storage. New Zealand considered the highest priority should be 
accorded to the collection and provision of data to the Scientific Committee. 
 
Japan considered the role of data collection by the Secretariat to be obligatory and 
important as there will be a need for the Secretariat to respond to the requests for 
information from other organisations. 
 
10.2 Implementation of Article 8 (9) of the Convention, Monitoring 
 
The Commission agreed that the Compliance Committee develop a report and 
recommendations for action on implementing Article 8 (9) for the next Commission 
meeting. Australia and New Zealand noted that the implementation of vessel 
monitoring programmes was a critical issue for the Commission and should be accorded 
high priority. 
 
Japan reported that in the last year it had increased efforts in monitoring high seas 
fishing operations. All parties confirmed that Terms of Reference for the Compliance 
Committee should abide by the Convention and international law. 
 
The Commission was encouraged that Taiwan had implemented real time reporting by 
VMS. 
 
New Zealand reported that as from October 1997, it would be implementing an 
expanded Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) in its Exclusive Economic Zone. The 
implementation of VMS programmes offered the potential for savings and efficiencies 
in the collection of real time catch and monitoring information. 
 
10.3 Collaborative Research Programmes 
 
Japan made a presentation on collaborative research programmes between Japan and 
Australia for information purposes. 
 
Japan and Australia started a five year collaborative research program in 1988 for the 
purpose of monitoring SBT recruitment by fishery independent methods. This program 
was followed by the second five year program from 1993 involving aerial survey, 
tagging, and other projects. Some of the results of these programmes had been reported 
at the Scientific Committee and their usefulness was recognised by the Committee. 
Japan had also submitted an application for a survey, to be started from January 1997 by 
R/V Shoyo Maru of the Fisheries Agency, in SBT spawning areas within the Australian 
200 mile zone. Japan requested the understanding and cooperation from Australia on 
this project. 
 
 
22
Australia said that it supported the Shoyo Maru project and emphasised the importance 
of continuation of these collaborative programmes. The Commission encouraged Japan 
and Australia to maintain and extend the collaborative research program on recruitment 
monitoring. 
 
Australia requested the Commission to adopt the otolith sampling and archiving 
proposal from the Scientific Committee. Australia proposed that the otolith archiving 
should be conducted by the CCSBT Secretariat. Japan expressed its support for both 
proposals on the condition that details of the proposals should be discussed in an 
appropriate manner, that sampling and archiving should not be controlled by a particular 
member, and that the projects should not interfere with commercial fishing operations. 
The Commission agreed that all parties should proceed with otolith sampling 
taking the above matters into consideration. 
 
10.4 Conversion Factors  
 
The Commission noted that a collaborative analysis on conversion factors had 
been undertaken by scientists of the three countries. 
 
New Zealand noted that the results of that work that the applications of the currently 
used conversion factors was resulting in the underestimation of catch. 
 
Ideally the Commission would like to move towards a situation where the parties were 
using the same accurate conversion factors, but there are management implications 
which make this difficult at this time, and some implications for the scientific 
assessment which need to be addressed. 
 
Japan requested further investigation of appropriate conversion factors and noted that 
since the current TAC had been calculated on current conversion factors, adjustment 
should be made to increase the TAC if the conversion factor in the Scientific Committee 
report was deemed appropriate for use by the Commission. 
 
Agenda Item 11: Global Total Allowable Catch and Quota Allocation 
 
Japan proposed to increase the current Global Total Allowable Catch (TAC) by at least 
3,000 metric tonnes for the next fishing season stating the following reasons: 
 
a) 
Since the TAC for the SBT fisheries has been restricted at 11,750 metric tonnes 
since 1989, the closure of the fisheries is becoming earlier and earlier in the recent 
years because of possible increases of the SBT CPUE; 
 
b) Recruitments of all the year classes after 1987 have been kept at higher levels than 
those of the early 1980s; 
 
c) 
Most of the VPA runs clearly indicated the increase of the parental biomass in the 
recent years; 
 
d) Retrials of the Japanese VPAs and projections, referred in the Report of the 
 
23
Scientific Committee, also indicated clear signs of the recovery of the SBT stocks. 
 
New Zealand did not believe a TAC increase was appropriate and supported this view 
with the following points: 
 
a) 
the parental stock continues to be substantially less than 1980 parental biomass 
levels which corresponds to commonly used thresholds for biologically safe 
parental biomass; 
 
b) there is little or no evidence that the parental stock is rebuilding and in fact there is 
a reasonable probability of decline in the near future; 
 
c) 
significant uncertainties in the assessment create real difficulties for the managers. 
 
New Zealand suggested that serious consideration will need to be given to catch 
reductions in the near future if the outlook in the assessment does not improve. 
 
Australia had different views from Japan's on the condition and probability of the 
recovery of the SBT stocks. It expressed concerns regarding low parental biomass and 
the sensitivity of all projections to increase in catch, perceived low abundance of 3 to 4 
year SBT, and substantially lower probabilities of the stock recovery under the catch 
scenario of permanent increase of 3,000 metric tonnes per year. Consequently, Australia 
considered there was no justification for the proposed increase of the TAC. Australia 
reminded the Commission that historically the stock projections had been shown to be 
overly optimistic. 
 
No decision on TAC was made at this time. 
 
The Commission noted that its decisions shall be taken by a unanimous vote of the 
parties at the Commission meeting. 
 
Australia and New Zealand expressed their concern that they would soon be in the 
position of having to determine their national catch limits for 1996-97. They stated that, 
in the absence of a decision being reached by that time, they would abide by the 
national allocations agreed for 1995-96 as if they were still in force. 
 
Australia and New Zealand stressed that this was a much less acceptable situation to 
them than reaching a consensus decision in the Commission. All sides committed to 
resolving the important matters of TAC, national allocation, the proposal to implement a 
pilot programme and the question of future action on ERS, at the resumed third Annual 
meeting of the CCSBT to be held as soon as possible. 
 
Agenda Item 12: Establishment of Future Quota Allocation Mechanism 
 
Japan tabled a proposal for a future quota allocation mechanism (Attachment P) in 
accordance with the agreement reached at the Second Special Meeting of the CCSBT. 
The proposal followed the provisions of Article 8.4 of the CCSBT Convention and 
assigned certain weights on the criteria to be considered in deciding allocations. Japan 
 
24
stressed that the current allocation system was inappropriate because no consideration 
was given to the possibility of new entrants while the Commission was promoting 
non-members to join the CCSBT. Japan considered that the system was also 
inappropriate because no consideration was given to the historical catch records of the 
members, fishing capacities of the members, and social and economic dependence of 
their fishing industry on the SBT fisheries. 
 
Australia and New Zealand stated that they would like more time for studying the 
proposal in detail before discussing it. In the meantime the existing understanding 
should prevail. 
 
The Commission decided to discuss this matter at the next Annual Meeting. 
 
Agenda Item 13: Management Strategy 
 
Australia proposed that the Commission develop a management strategy. The process in 
which the strategy would be developed is at Attachment Q. 
 
New Zealand welcomed Australia's proposal and suggested that elements which could 
be included in the draft included research planning, information management and data 
handling. Furthermore, New Zealand reported that management strategies which had 
been developed in collaboration with sector groups, including industry, had been 
successful. 
 
New Zealand and Australia maintained that given the current status of the SBT stock, 
the degree of uncertainty in the assessment and the recent listing of SBT as critically 
endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals, the development of a 
management strategy was an issue of high priority and should be developed as a matter 
of urgency. They felt it was essential that the Commission be seen to be acting 
responsibly and that the development of a visible and transparent mechanism to rebuild 
the SBT stock was an essential component of this task. 
 
New Zealand noted that until the Commission is able to agree on the broad management 
directions, the Commission would have some difficulty addressing or agreeing to many 
of the lower level management issues which it faces. 
 
Japan felt there was no need to develop a management strategy because the Commission 
already had the long-term objective of rebuilding the parental biomass to the 1980 level 
of biomass by the year 2020. 
 
Australia indicated its intention to prepare and circulate a revised paper on management 
strategy. Japan did not consider this work to be high priority and further noted that even 
if Japan responds to the Australian proposal, it could not commit to responding within 
the eight week timeframe proposed by Australia. The decision on convening a 
management strategy workshop was left open to be resolved no later than the resumed 
Third Annual Meeting. 
 
 
 
25
Agenda Item 14: Experimental Fishing, including Pilot Program 
 
Japan made a presentation on a Joint Pilot Program (JPP) for Experimental Fishing 
Program (EFP) for SBT (CCSBT/SC/96/33) (Attachment R) which was submitted to 
the 1996 CCSBT Scientific Committee in accordance with the Agreed Timetable for 
Evaluation and Development of an Experimental Fishing Program (the Second Special 
Meeting of the CCSBT, May 1996) but never discussed at the Committee. Comments 
received from New Zealand and Australia shortly after the Scientific Committee are at 
Attachments S and T. 
 
Japan said the objective of the JPP is to conduct a feasibility study on the full scale EFP 
for the purpose of obtaining information about necessary area and time coverage, 
necessary amount of samples, and other basic factors of the EFP. Japan believes that the 
JPP would also provide valuable information to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the 
CPUE hypotheses by obtaining data from the areas and time lacking recent commercial 
fishing data. 
 
Japan proposed that Part I of the JPP, which would attempt to reproduce the past 
commercial fishing operation patterns, would be conducted in the fourth quarter of 1996 
(October to December) in the CCSBT areas 7 and 8. Two options for the method of the 
deployment of fishing vessels were presented, on which Japan requested to have 
discussions at a workshop. 
 
The intended sample size for the Part I is up to 1,500 metric tonnes, on which Japan also 
would like to have scientific discussions at the workshop. Part II of the JPP was based 
on an Australian EFP proposal submitted at the Shimizu Workshop on EFP in May - 
June 1996. Japan reiterated its proposal for a workshop to be held immediately after the 
Commission meeting to have more detailed discussions on the implementation of the 
JPP. 
 
New Zealand and Australia could not endorse Japan's proposal at this time. They noted 
that for the Commission to make an informed and defensible decision on the 
implementation of either a full or pilot EFP or proceed with step 3, steps 1 and 2 of the 
schedule of activities to consider experimental fishing had to be completed and the 
result considered by the Commission. 
 
New Zealand maintained that experimental fishing was one of a number of measures 
which could be undertaken to reduce uncertainty in the stock assessment. It felt that the 
benefits of undertaking an EFP should clearly outweigh the additional risk which 
additional catches resulting from an EFP would pose to the potential recovery of the 
stock. In May the parties had agreed that any increase in catch recommended above the 
current TAC to accommodate experimental fishing should not jeopardise the potential 
recovery of the parental stock to the 1980 level by 2020, or undermine other agreed 
management objectives. They recognised the potential benefits of an EFP that had 
agreed objectives and that was appropriately designed and monitored. New Zealand also 
stated that the JPP should be conducted within the current limit of TAC as it had 
concerns regarding the present condition of SBT stocks. They emphasised the 
importance of completing the steps defined by the timetable before the consideration 
 
26
and implementation of the JPP. 
 
Australia also regarded the additional removal from the SBT stock unacceptable in view 
of the results of the stock assessment presented at the Scientific Committee. It referred 
to the Australian comments on the JPP, dated 12 September 1996, and stated that a 
number of questions should be answered regarding the design and scale of the Program 
on the basis of the Objectives and Principles compiled at the Second Special Meeting of 
the CCSBT. Australia noted that steps 1 and 2 had not been completed, so it was not 
possible to evaluate the risks associated with an EFP. 
 
Specifically, Australia didn't believe the proposed time coverage of the JPP (October to 
December) would contribute to the resolution of uncertainties in the CPUE 
interpretation. Australia also noted that the recovery probability of the SBT to the 1980 
level by 2020 would be substantially reduced under all projection scenarios except the 
one involving an increase of 3,000t for 3 years followed by a decrease for 3 years of 
3,000t below the current TAC. 
 
Japan responded that the timetable was agreed among the parties after difficult 
discussions and concessions and, therefore, it was the responsibility of the CCSBT to 
fulfil the agreement. In this regard, Japan expressed strong frustration on the lack of 
progress in this matter and requested a clear decision by the Commission. Australia and 
New Zealand did not agree with this statement. 
 
Japan also stated that the removal of 1,500 metric tonnes would in its estimation reduce  
the recovery probability by only 0.5%, which was well within the range of standard 
error and therefore negligible. The areas (7 and 8) and period (October to December) 
were specifically selected in order to obtain maximum information for the reduction of 
the differences in the CPUE models. Therefore, Japan emphasised that parts of Step 1 
and Step 2 had already been completed as far as the JPP was concerned. 
 
In addition, Japan stated that the implementation of the Joint Pilot Program would 
contribute to the design of the full scale EFP and was thus necessary for the completion 
of the steps defined in the Timetable. 
 
Japan stressed the importance of immediate implementation of the Joint Pilot Program, 
while it questioned whether other members had no intention to agree on the 
implementation of the Program under any circumstances. New Zealand and Australia 
responded that they were willing to consider the implementation of an EFP or Pilot 
Program following the completion of all the steps agreed by the parties. The completion 
of these steps would enable the Commission to make a decision on action to take to 
resolve the most important areas of uncertainty through an integrated program of work. 
 
Agenda Item 15: Rules of Procedure for the Scientific Committee 
(including Agenda Item 16: Policy on Employment of External 
Scientists and Other Experts) 
 
Issues arising in the conduct of this year's Scientific Committee Meeting were discussed. 
The Chair prepared a list of issues to be resolved and noted that to effectively deal with 
 
27
the list of issues (Attachment U) more time than was available at this Commission 
meeting would be needed. She invited delegations to notify her later if there were any 
additional issues they wished to be added to the list. 
 
Issues raised under the agenda item relating to policy on employment of external 
scientists was incorporated into this item. 
 
It was agreed that a small workshop would be held involving senior managers and 
scientists of the parties to resolve the issues as listed. Resolution of the details of the 
meeting was deferred until the resumed third Annual Meeting of the Commission. 
 
Agenda Item 16: Terms of Reference for the Compliance Committee 
 
Revised draft Terms of Reference for the Standing Committee on Compliance were 
tabled (Attachment V). Japan said that it was unable to agree to the terms of reference 
at this meeting as they needed to be referred to its Government for consideration. It was 
agreed that Australia would Chair this Committee for the next two years and, 
together with the Secretariat, would seek agreement to the Terms of Reference 
through diplomatic channels prior to the meeting of the committee which will be 
held in conjunction with the Fourth Annual Meeting.  
 
Agenda Item 17: Program of Work for 1996-97 
 
17.1 Arrangements between CCSBT, other States and Entities 
 
 
17.1.1 
Indonesia, Korea and Taiwan 
 
The Chair invited the non member observers to comment on how their respective 
countries/entities may best be encouraged to join the CCSBT or to cooperate with its 
management arrangements. 
 
The Korean delegation already explained its position at its opening statement. In 
addition, the Korean delegation will recommend to the Korean Government dispatching 
of a scientific observer to the Scientific Committee of CCSBT and providing catch data 
for CCSBT. 
 
Taiwan's observer noted Taiwan's rights to join regional management regimes under the 
UN Agreement on Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and Straddling Fish Stocks. 
 
The Indonesian observer noted that it was working towards developing an accurate data 
base of information on SBT catches by Indonesia. The Indonesian observer indicated 
that the Indonesian Embassy in Canberra would be prepared to assist in directing any 
inquires the Commission may have to the Indonesian Government. 
 
The Indonesian observer advised that Indonesia was still making efforts to improve data 
collection on Southern Bluefin Tuna to assist in fisheries management. The Indonesian 
government was also still considering its position on membership of the CCSBT, 
however, the efforts being made by the CCSBT members to manage the fishery were 
 
28
acknowledged. 
 
 
17.1.2 
Other Non-Members 
 
Consideration on this matter was deferred. 
 
17.2 Scientific Workshops 
17.3 Other workshops 
17.4 Meeting of the Scientific Committee 
 
These items were discussed under Agenda Item 19.3: Closure of the Meeting. 
 
17.5 Meeting/s of the Commission 
 
The timing of the Commission Meeting is reported under Agenda Item 19.3: Closure of 
the Meeting. However, agreement was reached on Standing Committees as follows: 
 
a) 
The Chair outlined the agreements to establish: 
 
(i) a Standing Committee for Compliance, and 
 
(ii) a Standing Committee for Finance and Administration,  
 
as well as revisions to the draft terms of reference of the Compliance 
Committee. It was agreed that the Committees would be formed and would 
usually meet immediately prior to the main plenary of the CCSBT, in parallel.  
A shorter plenary would deal with the substance of reports prepared by the 
Committees and other important matters. The committees were to be chaired 
by Australia and Japan respectively for the first two years. 
 
Japan noted that it would need to consider the terms of reference for the Compliance 
Committee in Japan and that it still regarded the ERS as a working group, not a 
Standing Committee, as it was not as important as finance and administration and 
compliance. 
 
New Zealand was strongly of the view that the ERS group should be a Standing 
Committee and noted its concern at the implications of giving these issues low 
importance. Australia concurred with this view, and indicated that in its view seabird 
bycatch and ERS were very high priorities regardless of the terminology used to 
describe the ERS committee. 
 
Agenda Item 18: Other Business 
 
Non Retention of Small Fish 
 
It was agreed that whatever policies are adopted by national fleets in regard to the 
non retention of fish, parties should encourage all of their fleets to operate 
consistently with their policies. 
 
29
 
Agenda Item 19: Close of the Meeting 
 
19.1 Election of Chair and Vice Chair of 1996-97 
 
The meeting did not close, therefore the elections did not occur. 
 
19.2 Adoption of the Report of the Meeting  
 
The meeting approved and adopted the report of this first session of the Third 
Annual Meeting  
 
19.3 Closure of the Meeting 
 
The Commission agreed to adjourn this meeting. 
 
The Commission agreed to a programme for data collection and exchange for the 
annual stock assessment which would be followed in 1997 and future years unless 
varied by agreement.  On this basis it was agreed that the Scientific Committee 
would be held from 28 July to 8 August 1997. The Commission also agreed that, 
subject to confirmation, the Fourth Annual Commission Meeting would be held 
from 8 to 13 September 1997.  The Commission agreed to the set of questions to 
be addressed by the 1997 Scientific Committee Meeting at Attachment W. 
 
It was also agreed that: 
a) the Third Annual Meeting would be resumed as soon as possible at a later 
date; 
b) each country would undertake the work required to complete steps 1 and 2, 
and when all parties agreed that the necessary preparatory work had been 
done, they will hold a workshop on steps 1 and 2; 
c) 
a workshop would be held on step 3-experimental design; 
d) a meeting of the Working Group on Ecologically Related Species  would be 
held; 
e) 
a workshop on Management Strategy would be held; 
f) 
a workshop to improve the Scientific Committee process, based on the issues 
at Attachment U, would also be held. 
 
However, the timing and priorities for a) to f) had yet to be agreed and it was not 
clear if all could be held before the next Annual Meeting.

Third Annual Meeting 
of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
 
Opening Statement by Japan 
 
Mr Chairman, Country Representatives and Observers, 
 
At the outset of the 3rd Annual Meeting of CCSBT, I would like to say a few words. 
 
At this 3rd Annual Meeting of the CCSBT, I consider that it is time for the CCSBT to 
demonstrate to the international community the usefulness and effectiveness of its work 
as a responsible regional fisheries organisation by following the Convention. To be 
specific, the Commission is required, firstly, to evaluate the present status and project 
future trends of the SBT stock on the basis of the best available data, secondly, to 
establish and implement appropriate conservation, management, and optimal utilisation 
measures, and lastly, to manage its activities openly and equitably by complying with 
established rules. 
 
However, based on the review of  the current situation of the CCSBT, I deeply regret 
that the CCSBT has not fulfilled its responsibility as a regional fisheries organisation. 
 
As you are aware, scientists from Australia, Japan and New Zealand are at an impasse 
where they have not yet been able to present agreed views on the evaluation of the 
current status and projection of the future trends of the stock despite their long history 
of studies on the SBT stock. This makes the discussion on the conservation and 
management measures by the Commission difficult. To find a way out from this 
difficult situation, Japan proposed an Experimental Fishing Program (EFP) at the last 
annual meeting for the purpose of solving the uncertainties on the stock assessment and 
facilitating the scientific discussions. 
 
Japan proposed to discuss two items, Total Allowable Catch (TAC) recommendation 
and EFP including the Pilot Program at this year’s annual meeting of the Scientific 
Committee held in Hobart. With regard to the TAC recommendation, which is the 
Commission’s fundamental function stipulated in Article 9.2 (d) of the Convention, it 
was concerned that having no discussion on this issue would lead the Scientific 
Committee to neglect its responsibilities. Therefore, Japan regrets that no discussion 
was conducted at the Scientific Committee meeting because of the shortage of time 
although an agenda item was established for the issue. However, judging from 
information presented at the Scientific Committee meeting, Japan is convinced that it is 
becoming clearer that the recent trend of the SBT stock indicates its recovery and the a 
fixed additional catch will hardly affect the stock recovery. Therefore, Japan will 
propose to increase TAC at this annual meeting again as it had in the last meeting. 
 
With regard to the Pilot Program, it has been scheduled to make a decision for its 
implementation  at this annual meeting based on the timetable agreed at the Special 
Meeting in May this year. Japan proposed to include this item to the agenda of the 
Scientific Committee meeting as it was indispensable for the Commission to have 
scientific advice from the Scientific Committee to make a decision. However, as you are 
aware, the Scientific Committee was concluded without any discussion on this issue as 
the other parties opposed Japan’s proposal, insisting that the agenda was already full 
and time for the discussion about the Pilot Program was not available. Japan strongly 
regrets that the failure to follow the timetable for EFP agreed at the Special Meeting in 
May this year and to give necessary scientific advice to this annual meeting of the 
Commission would jeopardise the international credibility of the CCSBT. As the total 
of three Special Meetings have been held since last year and the work has been 
continued also through the workshops regarding this issue, it is necessary to maintain 
and develop this momentum, and overcome this impasse with regard to the stock 
assessment and projection of future trends. Considering these points, Japan proposed to 
hold a workshop on this issue immediately before or after this annual meeting for the 
implementation of the agreed timetable after the conclusion of this year’s annual 
meeting of the Scientific Committee. Regretfully, all parties could not support the 
workshop to be held before this meeting. Therefore, Japan urges the CCSBT to agree on 
the proposal to hold the workshop at the earliest possible time after this meeting. With 
regard to the comments received on the Pilot Program presented at the Scientific 
Committee meeting, I would like to discuss them in detail under relevant agenda items. 
 
Japan also deeply regrets that this year’s Scientific Committee meeting failed to adopt 
an agreed report to the Commission. One of the reasons for that was that there were 
different views between parties on such procedures as report preparation and decision 
making by the Scientific Committee. To fulfil its effectiveness and responsibilities as a 
regional fishery organisation, Japan believes it is essential for the CCSBT to establish 
open and equitable rules of procedure for the Scientific Committee to rectify and 
improve the past practices established in the Trilateral Scientific Meeting before the 
establishment of the CCSBT Convention. Therefore, with regard to  the current 
discussion on the rules of procedure for the Scientific Committee, Japan is prepared to 
review the current proposal with these views in mind and make additional suggestions 
when necessary. Japan appreciates the efforts of scientists who had continued to work 
on the report through correspondence and have succeeded in finalising it . 
 
The UN Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks Agreement was 
developed last year. The First Meeting of the Interim Scientific Committee for Tuna and 
Tuna-Like Species in the North Pacific Ocean was held this spring and  the Indian 
Ocean Tuna Commission will begin its operation on a full-scale in this December.  In 
addition, the SPF Meeting which was held recently endorsed the convening of  the 
Second Multilateral High-Level Conference on the Conservation and Management of 
Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific in the beginning of 
next year. These show that the global activities on tuna stock management are becoming 
more progressive. The public interest in the management of marine living resources is 
increasing through ratification of  the UNCLOS in Japan. In these circumstances, Japan 
is willing to make its best efforts for the CCSBT to achieve its mission as a responsible 
regional fishery organisation. 
 
Finally, I would like to welcome the representatives from non-parties and international 
organisations attending as observers who are interested in conservation, management 
and optimum utilisation of the SBT stock. I also would like to extend congratulations 
for the establishment of  the Secretariat and the opening of its office recently, and 
express my appreciation to the Australian Government for its efforts to establish the 
Secretariat and hold this annual meeting. 
 
In concluding my opening remarks, I hope this week’s discussion will have many 
fruitful outcomes.

Opening Statement for New Zealand 
Third Annual Meeting of the CCSBT 
23-27 September 1996 
 
Over the last fifteen years of cooperation, New Zealand, Australia and Japan have 
realised some significant achievements. We have built a solid foundation for continuing 
collaboration. The Convention document provides a robust and comprehensive 
framework-we have a well developed working relationship-and crucially, we have 
jointly taken management action which averted likely stock collapse. 
 
There are also positive elements to our recent work. To date all parties have shown a 
willingness to work through issues on which we have different views. Consequently, 
three additional Commission meetings were held to consider the issue of experimental 
fishing and the setting of a TAC. We were able to establish a process, with an agreed set 
of principles and objectives, to evaluate experimental fishing as a mechanism to address 
uncertainty in the stock assessment. 
 
As part of that process, a number of technical workshops were held, all of which have 
usefully improved our understanding of the factors contributing to the uncertainty in the 
assessment. The scientists now have a better understanding of the models the respective 
parties use, are have made some progress towards using an agreed base case as part of 
the assessment. 
 
However, we have also expended a lot of time in meetings since and including the last 
Commission meeting-three special meetings, four workshops and one Scientific 
Committee meeting-by my calculation, nearly ten weeks. Although each of these 
meetings made progress, particularly the workshops, I think we would agree that we 
would like to have achieved more with that expenditure of time and resources. 
 
There is a considerable amount of work yet to be done in addressing a number of the 
important issues the Commission faces. New Zealand believes we have a responsibility 
to agree what those issues are and their priority and then design a collaborative process 
to work toward their resolution. 
 
New Zealand suggests that the most important of the problems and external threats 
which we must resolve include: 
 
� 
stock status 
� 
scientific process 
� 
uncertainty 
� 
accession of further parties 
� 
international credibility 
� 
no management strategy 
 
 
Stock Status 
 
Although there is a disparity of views over stock projections - all parties agree that the 
stock is less than 8% of the 1960 level of parental biomass and that the stock is less than 
39% of the 1980 level of parental biomass. The conclusion we reach is that the parental 
biomass is severely depleted and that recent recruitment has yet to affect significant 
rebuild. 
 
Recent biomass levels are clearly far from optimal - harvests for our industries must be 
restrained far below their potential; there is uncertainty about the security of these levels 
- recruitment is unstable and may decline due to uncontrollable environmental factors.  
Our primary focus must be to be sure that we are taking positive action to rebuild the 
parental biomass. 
 
Scientific Process 
 
It is evident that the last scientific meeting used much of its valuable and limited time 
debating issues of procedure and administration. To some degree this seems to have 
been caused by inadequate guidance from the managers and a very full work 
programme. Rather than re-litigate all the disagreement that is evident in the report - I 
believe we have to accept that there are different views on the stock projections - and 
we need to discuss carefully with our scientists the best way to make rapid progress 
towards a closer resolution. We also need to identify the real issues behind the 
procedural and administrative problems - and fix them so that the future meetings can 
get on with the science. 
 
Uncertainty 
 
The utility of the current assessment to managers is severely constrained by the 
disparity between the groups of scientists at the meeting. In past meetings, and again in 
the recent scientific committee, they have identified a number of sources of uncertainty 
that contribute to this disparity. There is real urgency to agree to a programme to resolve 
these sources of uncertainty, as this situation is deteriorating rather than improving.  
Experimental fishing may form one component of this programme - but in isolation it 
will not resolve all, or even necessarily the most important sources of uncertainty. 
 
Accession of Further Parties 
 
The CCSBT cannot achieve its objective of ensuring the conservation and optimal 
utilisation of SBT while catches taken outside the arrangement are significant and 
unrestrained. NZ supports an active dialogue with potential entrants in the arrangement 
to ascertain their intentions and discuss with them steps to see them accede or 
co-operate with the Convention in the near future. 
 
International Credibility 
 
We have been aware that other organisations and governments around the world watch 
take considerable interest in the stock and our actions or inaction. In October, southern 
bluefin tuna will very publicly be listed as 'critically endangered' by IUCN - one of the 
world's largest and most influential conservation organisations. Although the listing has 
no immediate management implications - clearly it will draw attention on SBT and 
criticism in some quarters - at worst this listing could potentially be used as the basis for 
a listing with CITES-which would impact significantly on our industries and the 
operation of this arrangement. In order to address criticism we need to be seen to have 
credible and responsible management body - this leads directly into the final point - 
 
We have no agreed management strategy - we believe this is fundamental to resolving 
many of the other issues we are grappling - if we do not have at least a level of shared 
understanding on our objectives - we will flounder when trying to agree on specific 
management actions. 
 
Very real threats need to be addressed to assure the future of the stock and confirm the 
competence of the Commission. New Zealand's objective for these discussions is to 
return home with a report and an agreed work programme formulated to maximise the 
use of our joint resources to address the key issues faced by the Commission. To 
achieve this the New Zealand delegation will attempt to communicate clearly our views, 
but also make every effort to understand the perspective of other parties - we look 
forward to working with the parties and the chair to achieve these objectives over the 
next five days.

2.3 AUSTRALIAN OPENING STATEMENT 
 
I would like to welcome all delegations to the third annual meeting of the Commission 
and also to welcome the representatives from non-member countries and international 
organisations. 
 
Australia noted that this is the first meeting of the Commission which has enjoyed the 
support of the new Secretariat, and I would like to acknowledge the Acting Executive 
Secretary and his staff for their excellent organisation for the conduct of this meeting. 
 
Australia remains completely committed to the successful operation of this Commission, 
and through that, to effective international management of the southern bluefin tuna 
fishery. 
It is clear that the Commission is at a crucial point in its development and all of us have 
a special duty of care to see that we can together chart a path towards recovery and 
sustainable production from this valuable fishery. 
 
The long-term well-being of the resource and the SBT fishing industries in each of our 
countries depends on the way we work together this week and beyond. 
 
I have to say at the outset that Australia is extremely concerned at the events of the last 
four weeks. It is regrettable that those who have sought wholesale change to the 
established and practicable scientific processes of the Commission have been willing to 
demand such change at the expense of the comprehensive stock assessment which is so 
vital to the functioning of this Commission and to the management decisions we are all 
required to make. 
 
From Australia's point of view, the credibility, competence and calibre of the 
Commission are at stake. It is time for the Commission to embrace sound standards of 
fisheries management in a way which genuinely reflects the uncertainties in the stock 
assessment and the current status of SBT stocks. 
 
There may be differences of view on various aspects of the stock assessment, but the 
fact remains that the SBT stock is depleted to levels far below the 'safe' 1980 level of 
parental biomass and to levels which represent an alarmingly small proportion of virgin 
biomass. 
 
Australia is keen to explore ways for the parties to together address the current 
difficulties facing the commission. Several factors are important in this regard. firstly, 
the integrity of the Commission's scientific work must be assured, producing 
assessments which can stand up to international scrutiny. There needs to be clear 
separation of the scientific and management processes. 
 
A crucial issue for this meeting is whether additional removals will jeopardise stock 
recovery. We all agreed in may that additional catch, even for experimental fishing, 
would only be contemplated if it could be shown not to jeopardise stock recovery. 
 
We obviously have substantial discussions ahead of us, but I should register clearly at 
this point Australia's commitment to maintaining a responsible management framework 
around the fishery which is capable of providing for stock recovery to safe and 
sustainable levels. 
 
Our job as managers in this Commission is to identify the best way to deal with 
differences and uncertainties, to strengthen the co-operative framework which we have 
together built over the last 15 years. There may be challenging times ahead, but we are 
confident that all parties are equal to the task and can together secure to secure a healthy 
future for all of our SBT industries.

Review of SBT Fisheries --- Japan 
 
1 
1995 Fishing Season  (1.3.95 - 28.2.96) 
 
(1) Fishing period, number of vessels, catch by area was coordinated in order to utilise 
the Japanese national quota of 6 065 metric tonnes efficiently. The total accumulated 
number and the real number of far seas longline fishing vessels targeted SBT was 
approximately 240* and 200**, respectively. The total catch was 5 866 metric tonnes. 
(* Simple summation of the number of vessels by area, ** Actual number of vessels 
operated, without double or multiple counting) 
 
(2) The 1995 fishing operations for SBT were closed as of November 10, when the final 
setting of longline was made. The Japanese SBT fishing operations utilising Australian 
quota set aside for Japan were conducted outside of the standard fishing period and 
continued until the end of February, 1996. All the vessels operated in the high seas 
participated in the RTMP (Real Time Monitoring Program; to report catch and other 
fishing information every day by fax) 
 
(3) For the purpose of contributing to the increase of the SBT stocks, the fishing 
industry released, as a voluntary measure, a juvenile fish smaller than 25 kg on the high 
seas when the fish was alive at the time of retrieval. A vessel with a scientific observer 
on board would retain the juvenile fish in order to collect data representative of the total 
population. 
Quota management was conducted by adding estimated weight of released fish 
presumed dead after the release to the catch weight. The mortality rate of the released 
fish was estimated by the information from fishing vessels with scientific observers and 
the past RTMP data. 
 
(4) With regard to the Australian quota of 650 metric tonnes set aside for Japan, 471.5 
metric tonnes was caught in the high seas outside of the standard Japanese fishing 
period, leaving 178.5 metric tonnes unused. 
Although the fishing vessels made efforts to utilise the quota fully and effectively, those 
vessels chose to go back to Japan over the end of the year following the general custom 
of the Japanese fishing vessels. 
 
2. 
1996 Fishing Season (1.3.96 - 29.2.97) 
 
(1) Fishing period, number of vessels, catch by area was adjusted downward in the 1996 
fishing season. The Japanese longliners will not operate in the NZ 200 mile waters in 
this season because the main fishing period had already passed before the conclusion of 
the access negotiation with New Zealand. The access negotiation was delayed due to the 
delay of decisions on a TAC and its national allocations at the CCSBT to May 1996. 
 
(2) The Japanese fishing industry is continuing to release a live juvenile fish smaller 
than 25 kg on a voluntary basis in order to contribute to the increase of SBT stocks.

Review of SBT Fisheries - New Zealand 
 
We last had the opportunity to review the New Zealand SBT fishery at the Commission 
meeting in Tokyo. Since that time, there have been a number of changes in the fishery, 
but overall, many of the trends we have seen develop over the last few years have 
continued. 
 
Historically, southern bluefin in our zone were taken by Japanese foreign licensed 
vessels. There was very little domestic catch capacity or activity. Since 1989 this trend 
has reversed, with increasing effort by domestic industry; a trend which continued in 
1996. 
 
This season, 50-60 domestic operators were active in the fishery and caught SBT. The 
majority of these vessels are small owner operated ventures which catch less than three 
tonnes. They operate close to their home port, and supply the fresh SBT markets in 
Japan. 
 
In addition to the small operators, there are several medium to large domestic longline 
vessels, and some of those have freezer capacity. The introduction of larger domestic 
vessels with an increased catching capacity, has meant that both the areas and the 
seasons fished for SBT has increased. 
 
Whereas once our domestic SBT season was predominantly in the winter months of 
June to August, the season now extends from April to September. Some SBT are caught 
throughout the year. 
 
Unlike the expanding pattern seen in the domestic fishery, the areas fished for SBT by 
Japanese vessels have contracted since the early 1980s, as have the length of the season 
and catch rates throughout the zone. Considerably less fishing occurs in the areas of 
former importance such as the east coasts of the North and South Island. This has 
occurred despite the fact that these were the areas in which historically the larger, more 
valuable fish were taken. 
 
In recent years catch rates have declined in all but a few small areas. Consequently, both 
the domestic and Japanese vessels have focused their efforts in relatively small areas 
where they can maintain reasonable catch rates. This includes areas off Westland on the 
South Island, and the East Cape of the North Island where the average size of fish is 
smaller. 
 
Although juveniles are still appearing in our catches, there has been a sharp decline in 
the CPUE for juveniles between 1994 and 1995. Whereas once we had hoped that the 
increased abundance of juveniles would contribute to the rebuilding of the parental 
stock, we now believe it is most likely that the juvenile portion of the stock in the New 
Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is being fished down and will contribute little 
to the parental biomass. 
 
With respect to our total catches for 1994-95 fishing year, despite the New Zealand 
fishery being closed in August rather than September, New Zealand overcaught its catch 
limit by 15.2 tonnes. 
 
In recognition of our international obligation to respect New Zealand's 420 tonne catch 
limit, the Government determined and our domestic fishers, unanimously agreed to 
reduce the catch limit for the current year by the amount overcaught in the previous year.  
Therefore, this season, our catch limit has been reduced to 404 tonnes. Furthermore, in 
an effort to prevent overcatch in future years, mechanisms to more closely monitor 
in-season catch have been put in place with the full cooperation of our industry. 
 
This season, overcatch will not be an issue for our fishers. In 1996 the domestic fishery 
has experienced very poor catches. Catch rates are half those for 1995. This has 
occurred despite increased catching capacity and effort in the domestic fleet. Coupled 
with the decreased catch rates, other factors have also contributing significantly to the 
lower total catch. These include:- 
 
• 
lower market prices; 
• 
increased Government cost-recovery charges; and, 
• 
the late cancellation of charter vessel arrangements. 
 
All of these factors mean that the New Zealand total catch is likely to be less than 135 
tonnes this season. These figures will be verified over the next few months, and we 
hope will advise the Commission at a later date.

Review of Australia's SBT Fisheries-1996 
 
Surface fisheries off WA have ceased. Efforts to expand the small troll fishery off 
Tasmania (based on 12-25 kg SBT) have been unsuccessful and it failed in 1996. SA 
surface fishery operations on small juveniles were reduced to about 1440 t by 1992/93. 
With joint venture cessation in the latter part of 1995, only about 1300 t were taken by 
joint venture in the 1994/95 season. Domestic surface fishing activities increased in the 
1995/96 season (it was still in progress) to more than 4000 t, mainly by purse seining 
for cage-rearing but also by poling for fresh-chill exports. 
 
Sporadic reports of surface sightings of small juvenile SBT off NSW in the early 1990s 
suggested that some increased presence might be developing, but this did not eventuate 
despite the reduced surface activities in Western Australia and South Australia. However 
in August 1996 there were reports of appearance of schools of small juvenile (5-10 kg, 
ie 1+) SBT in the traditional NSW pole fishery area and at the time when such fish 
appeared seasonally. Further searching operations may occur, as the quota year does not 
end until 15 December 1996 (it commenced on 16 December 1995 because the 1994/95 
quota year completion date was extended from 30 October to 15 December 1995). 
 
Successive annual decreases in representations of younger SBT in winter season 
longline catches off Tasmania occurred after 1992 and are of concern. In 1996, 
decreases of 2, 3, 4, and 5-year olds were evident. The report in 1996 of 1+ SBT in the 
Sydney region offers some optimism. On the other hand the decreased representation of 
the four young cohorts in the longline catch must be regarded as a possible indication of 
a decline in SBT recruitment after 1990.

REVIEW OF SBT FISHERIES - TAIWAN 
 
I. 
The Fishery and the Catches 
 
Taiwan's high sea longline fishery commenced in the mid 1950s in the northern and 
eastern Indian Ocean, and then expanded to the other oceans. The main target species at 
that time was albacore. During the late 60s and the early 70s, the main catch was 
yellowfin tuna. From the mid 1980s, some longliners started to catch higher commercial 
value species by using vessels equipped with super freezers. Apart from bigeye and 
yellowfin tuna, southern bluefin tuna (SBT) is now one of the most important 
high-valued species. 
 
After 1993, Taiwan's SBT landings were estimated based on the sales records and the 
certified weight reports of Shin Nippon Kentai Kaisha, the New Japan Surveyors and 
Sworn Measures Association (NJSSMA). SBT landings were estimated as 1,003 tons in 
1994 and 1,447 tons in 1995, most of which were caught in the Indian Ocean (85% in 
1994 and 90% in 1995, respectively). 
 
In accordance to the recommendation made in the second CCSBT meeting, Taiwan will 
maintain the further year's catches at 1,447 tons, which is the same level as 1995. An 
official announcement has already been made in the beginning of 1996 to fulfil this 
purpose. 
 
II. The Catch Statistics  
 
Logbooks of Taiwan's high sea tuna fishery were collected by the Fisheries Department, 
Reconstruction Bureau, Kaohsiung Municipal Government (FDKMG), and were 
compiled by the Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University. But from July 
1996, the compilation of the catch statistics are to be made by the Overseas Fisheries 
Development Council of the Republic of China (OFDC), a nonprofit organisation with 
funds endowed by both the Government and the fishery industries. 
 
The catches of SBT were reported as bluefin tuna before 1994 and the item of SBT was 
not used in the logbooks until the end of 1994. The catch statistics of SBT will be 
available in the logbooks submitted since 1995. 
 
From 1996, based on the official announcement, every vessel that has caught SBT is 
required to report their catches in weight and fishing ground to FDKMG, and this 
information will then be passed to the Fisheries Department of the Council of 
Agriculture(FDCOA), the federal fishery authority, and the OFDC for controlling the 
total catch of SBT. This information will be compiled together with the logbooks 
submitted after their trips. 
 
 
 
III. Number of Vessels and Fishing Locations 
 
SBT was caught not only by vessels categorised as deep longliners but also by those 
categorised as regular longliners. In 1994, 41 vessels landed more than 10 tons of SBT, 
increasing to 49 in 1995. Up to July 1996, 68 vessels reportedly engaged in the catching 
of SBT, but the number of vessels that caught more than 10 tons of SBT was still low. 
 
Fig. 1 (overleaf) shows the fishing grounds from the daily reports of the 68 vessels from 
January to early August 1996. Most of the fishing activities took place on the waters 
between 30 to 40 degrees south and in the Indian Ocean. According to the available 
logbook data, the distribution profiles of 1994 and 1995 were similar with that of 1996.  
Most locations that have SBT catch in 1996 also had catch in 1994 and 1995.

Australian Industry Presentation on ITQ System 
 
Current Facts 
 
1. 
Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) System: 
 
 
• 
exists for SBT in Australia 
 
• 
applies to most species in New Zealand 
 
• 
being introduced in some inshore fisheries in Japan. 
 
2. 
SBT fishing is a global migratory resource but: 
 
 
• 
catching structure is still by country 
 
 
- 
eg Japan does not have the opportunity to participate in farming. 
 
3. 
Japan catches its quota in a short time each year 
 
 
• 
surrendering the SBT fishing ground to other countries; and 
 
• 
perhaps not maximising the value of the catch. 
 
4. 
Some countries have excess catching capacity 
 
 
• 
with no automatic system like ITQs to rationalise effort. 
 
Optimum Utilisation of SBT Resource 
 
Our experience is that ITQ's are the best way to achieve the optimum utilisation of the 
resource. 
 
Advantage of ITQ's 
 
1. 
It would make the SBT fishing a truly international one 
 
 
• 
eg Japan is not able to participate in tuna farming and other ways of optimum 
 
 
utilisation of resource 
 
• 
with ITQ's, Japan fishermen could farm their own quota in Australia and have 
 
 
total control over it. 
 
2. 
ITQ's give the fishermen ownership of the resource 
 
 
• 
and creates the incentive to conserve the resource. 
 
3. 
It provides much greater stability for fishing operations and crews. 
 
4. 
Fishermen can fish at the optimum time and catch and market the best fish. 
 
5. 
It would create a more unified research effort because the ownership of the benefits 
 
would be clearer. 
 
6. 
It would considerably improve relationships between governments and industry. 
 
7. 
ITQ's can be used for borrowing capital. 
 
8. 
It reduces the over-capitalisation in vessels which can be a waste. 
 
9. 
It would assist with solving the variable squares problem 
 
 
• 
both in area and times. 
 
Disadvantages 
 
Clearly there can be short-term problems 
 
 
• 
eg restructuring costs, but 
 
 
 
(i) at some stage restructuring must take place 
 
 
 
- 
(eg in Australia in 1984 we had to restructure somehow and ITQ's 
 
 
 
 
was the best way.) 
 
 
(ii) the speed of restructuring can be controlled by the rules.

CCSBT Position on Kyoto Declaration and Other International Fishing Initiatives 
 
Purpose 
 
1. 
Commission to consider an approach it may adopt in relation to instruments such as 
 
the Kyoto Declaration and other international fishing initiatives, in accordance with 
 
a request by the Commission at the last meeting. 
 
Background 
 
2. 
The Second special meeting of the Commission in Canberra in April 1996 decided 
 
that the Secretariat should prepare a paper outlining an approach for the 
 
Commission to adopt in terms of its position on instruments such as the Kyoto 
 
Declaration and other international fishing initiatives. The following information 
 
has been prepared in consultation with the Office of International Law, 
 
Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department. 
 
Consideration 
 
3. 
The CCSBT has been established by the Convention for the Conservation of 
 
Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT Convention) in accordance with the principles set out 
 
in UNCLOS (Article 64) as an international organisation through which coastal 
 
States and other States whose members nationals fish in the region for southern 
 
bluefin tuna can cooperate to ensure, through appropriate management, the 
 
conservation and optimum utilisation of Southern Bluefin Tuna throughout the 
 
region, both within and beyond exclusive economic or fishing zones. The CCSBT 
 
also has obligations in regard to ecologically related species. 
 
4. 
The ability of the CCSBT to give effect to, and participate in other international 
 
conventions and initiatives depends upon: 
 
(a) its own powers and responsibilities under the SBT Convention; 
 
(b) the views of the parties to the SBT Convention; and  
 
(c) provisions of the other relevant international instrument or initiative which is 
 
 
sought to be applied or in which participation is sought. 
 
These issues are canvassed in more detail overleaf. 
 
5. 
The SBT Convention does contain provisions relevant to the relationship between 
 
the Convention (including the CCSBT) and other international treaties and 
 
initiatives. Article 4 provides that neither the SBT Convention nor measures  
 
adopted under it prejudice the positions or views of any Party with respect to its 
 
rights or obligations under treaties and international instruments to which it is a 
 
party or its position or views with respect to the law of the sea. Thus parties to the 
 
SBT Convention are free to maintain a view on their obligations under other 
 
treaties unrestricted by the SBT Convention. Nevertheless, the views of the parties 
 
to the SBT Convention are likely to influence any decision taken by the CCSBT in 
 
relation to its application of, or participation in any other treaty or international 
 
instrument. Each party exercising voting rights on the CCSBT will contribute its 
 
interpretation and views on those other international conventions and initiatives. 
 
6. 
Also, there are a number of provisions of the SBT Convention which contemplate 
 
the involvement of the CCSBT with other international organisations and initiatives.  
 
Article 6.9 gives the Commission such legal capacity as is necessary to enjoy its 
 
relations with other international organisations. Article 12 provides for the CCSBT 
 
to collaborate with other inter-governmental organisations which have related 
 
objectives. It also provides that the Commission may make arrangements with such 
 
inter-governmental organisations. Article 14 enables the Commission to invite 
 
other inter-governmental organisations to send observers to the meeting of the 
 
Commission. 
 
7. 
The ability of the CCSBT to co-operate with other international organisations and 
 
to be involved in other treaties also is dependent upon the grounds for participation 
 
set out in those other international initiatives. For example, the 1995 Agreement 
 
relating to the Conservation and the Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and 
 
Highly Migratory Fish Stocks does provide for ratification and accession by certain 
 
international organisations, such as the European Union. However, it is unlikely 
 
that it provides for the CCSBT to become a party. Nevertheless, the operation of 
 
that Convention is very much dependent on the existence of regional fisheries 
 
management organisations such as the CCSBT. Furthermore, Article 44 of that 
 
Agreement provides that it does not alter the rights and obligations which arise 
 
from other compatible agreements. Those other agreements would include the SBT 
 
Convention. 
 
8. 
It would generally be the case that the CCSBT would have a limited opportunity to 
 
become a party to another binding international agreement or treaty. This, in part, is 
 
because very few other international conventions would provide for membership 
 
by the CCSBT. However, the CCSBT would still have a role. First, the actions of 
 
the CCSBT could be one means by which its members could implement their 
 
obligations under those other Conventions. (The CCSBT would, of course, only be 
 
able to act on those obligations if they were consistent with the provisions of the 
 
SBT Convention). Secondly, there would be scope for the CCSBT to enter into 
 
bilateral arrangements with other international organisations established by those 
 
Conventions in order to assist it in carrying out its functions under the SBT 
 
Convention. 
 
9. 
There are other international instruments in the form of guidelines or 
 
recommendations which the CCSBT may wish to apply. The application of these is 
 
voluntary. One example is the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries which 
 
provides a broad framework of fisheries conservation, management and 
 
development which is intended to apply to the widest range of entities associated 
 
with fisheries. The CCSBT could decide that it would undertake its functions and 
 
responsibilities in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Code. 
 
10. Similarly, the Kyoto Declaration is a form of political commitment by the 
 
participating parties to implement a plan of action either directly or in co-operation 
 
with, for example, other appropriate inter-governmental organisations. A number of 
 
actions in the Declaration relate to the activities of the CCSBT and members could 
 
decide to exercise CCSBT powers and responsibilities available under the SBT 
 
Convention, consistent with the Kyoto Declaration, noting that the primary 
 
obligation to implement the Declaration rests with the participating parties. Again 
 
the relevant part of the Kyoto Declaration could only be implemented to the extent 
 
that it was consistent with the powers and responsibilities under the SBT 
 
Convention. 
 
11. There is also the question of the ability of the CCSBT to participate in international 
 
meetings relating to fisheries management, including meetings of other 
 
international organisations. Those other international organisations may well have 
 
provision for the participation by observers such as the CCSBT, similar to that 
 
contained in Article 14 of the SBT Convention itself. Most international meetings 
 
now allow for participation by observers including international organisations, 
 
though frequently that participation is on a more limited basis than that allowed to 
 
countries. 
 
12. In summary, the ability of the CCSBT to apply other international instruments and 
 
to participate in other international initiatives will depend upon the application of 
 
the provisions of the SBT Convention, the views of the parties to the SBT 
 
Convention and on the provisions for participation established by the other 
 
particular international convention or initiative. 
 
Recommendations 
 
13. That members of the Commission advise the Secretariat of relevant inter-
 
governmental and other international organisations with which they are associated; 
 
14. That the Secretariat identify other inter-governmental or international organisations 
 
and international instruments which could affect the conservation and management 
 
of southern bluefin tuna; 
 
15. That the Secretariat report to the Commission on the relevant organisations and 
 
international instruments which could affect the conservation and management of 
 
southern bluefin tuna and include recommendations on whether the Commission 
 
should: 
 
 
(a) take no action,  
 
(b) monitor activities of the organisation, 
 
(c) seek to collaborate with the organisation, which could include data exchange 
 
 
and inviting observers to Commission meetings, 
 
(d) seek to enter into formal arrangements with the organisation, or  
 
(e) adopt all or part of the provisions of relevant international instruments.

Data Provision 
 
1. 
All parties shall provide 100% of the previous year's catch, effort, size composition 
 
and other agreed information relevant to the SBT stock assessment at a level of 
 
aggregation (ie area and time) sufficient to facilitate effective stock assessment and 
 
in a manner which guarantees confidentiality to the data providers. All data shall be 
 
provided to the CCSBT secretariat for provision to the parties. 
 
 
Current arrangements for data provision to parties are: 
 
 
- 
catch by month and by 5X5 degree square by gear type; 
 
 
- 
effort expressed as number of hooks for the longline fishery an number of days 
 
 
(operating and searching) for surface fisheries at the same resolution applied to 
 
 
the catch data; and  
 
 
- 
catch in number by 1cm size interval at the same resolution applied to the  
 
 
catch data where possible. 
 
2. 
Catch at age matrix and the magnitude and age composition of the non-party catch 
 
will be calculated at an appropriate temporal and spatial resolution. 
 
3. 
All parties shall provide the following data, other information and documents not 
 
later than the indicated times: 
 
 
Scientific Committee 
 
- 
all data described in 1 
12 weeks before 
 
- 
all derived data described in 2 
11 weeks before 
 
- 
standardised CPUE and a description 
6 weeks before 
 
- 
brief description of intended changes to VPAs 
4 weeks before 
 
- 
key documents 
1 week before 
 
- 
list of all documents for meeting 
1 week before 
 
 
Japan noted that for at least the 1997 SBT stock assessment that the earliest the 
 
data could be provided was by the end of April. Given the timetable above this 
 
would mean that the earliest that the Scientific Committee could meet would be the 
 
third week in July. In 1997 the Scientific Committee could be held during 28 July - 
 
8 August and that would imply a Commission meeting starting about 8 September. 
 
3. 
As deadlines approach, the CCSBT Secretariat should remind the parties as to the 
 
deadlines agreed above. The secretariat should provide a report to the Commission 
 
on the progress against the timetable and on any issues arising from the 
 
implementation of the timetable above. 
 
Other Data Issues 
 
It is necessary to distinguish the above mentioned procedures and requirements relating  
to data provision required to conduct the regular stock assessment process from those 
below relating to the collection and exchange of detailed data required for additional 
research supporting stock assessments. 
 
The situation with existing detailed data (RTMP and fine scale data) is as follows: 
 
Originally all data collected under the RTMP was shared among the scientists of the 
parties. However, in 1995 Japan expanded the RTMP to cover the whole fleet. These 
data therefore became equivalent to fine scale data for the entire fleet which under 
Japanese government policy cannot be released to parties under confidentiality 
requirements. Therefore since 1995, the RTMP data released by Japan were the   
season's data from vessels on which observers were present at some time during the 
fishing season. Japan has agreed to continue the same level of data provision to the 
scientists of all parties. Australia provides all RTMP data from bilateral and JV vessels 
fishing within the AFZ. New Zealand provides all RTMP data for SBT fleets within  
their EEZ. 
 
All countries have made fine scale data for their SBT fishery available to the scientists 
of all parties as long as all analyses are done collaboratively in the country where data 
are held. This practice will continue at present.

Proposal 
 
A FUTURE QUOTA ALLOCATION MECHANISM FOR PARTIES IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONVENTION

2. 
Relevant provisions of the Convention 
3. 
Interpretation of the provisions and weighting for each factor 
4. 
Example from other international fishery organisations 
5. 
Guidelines which should be adopted for the future 
1. 
Preamble 
 
Japan stressed as reflected in the report of the CCSBT Second Special meeting held from 
29 April to 3 May 1996 that the Commission should establish a new mechanism for future 
national quota allocation in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. It is 
recorded that Australia and New Zealand agreed to Japan’s request to review the current 
understanding of future national allocation at the 1996 Annual Meeting. Against this 
background, this proposal is to suggest the national quota allocation which is considered 
the most appropriate and fair when considering the  interpretation of the provisions of the 
Convention and the other international organisation’s customs. 
 
2. 
Relevant provisions of the Convention 
 
 
Article 8.4 of the CCSBT Convention is as follows; 
 
(a) relevant scientific evidence; 
(b) the need for orderly and sustainable development of southern bluefin tuna 
fisheries; 
(c) the interests of Parties through whose exclusive economic or fishery zones 
southern bluefin tuna migrates; 
(d) the interests of Parties whose vessels engaged in fishing for southern bluefin tuna 
including those which have historically engaged in such fishing and those which 
have southern bluefin tuna fisheries under development; 
(e) the contribution of each Party to conservation and enhancement of, and scientific 
research on southern bluefin tuna; 
(f) any other factors which the Commission deems appropriate. 
 
3. 
Interpretation and weighting of the factors which need to be considered under Article 
8.4 of the Convention 
 
 
(1) the factors that need to be considered are: 
 
(a) relevant scientific evidence; 
 
The issues that need to be considered specifically are: 
 
- 
the flexibility of each Party’s fishing industry to achieve MSY. 
- 
assessment of the contribution of each Party’s fishing industry in 
ensuring parental stocks at desirable levels. 
 
(b) the need for orderly and sustainable development of southern bluefin tuna 
fisheries; 
 
- 
current scale of fishing industry (numbers of fishing vessels, fishers, and 
the  regions depending on this fishery). 
 
- 
the social and economic backgrounds which make the sustainable 
development of fisheries possible. 
 
(c) the interests of coastal States through whose fishery zones southern bluefin 
tuna migrates; 
 
- 
the existence of spawning area of southern bluefin tuna and juvenile’s 
feeding area at each coastal State. 
 
- 
size of fishery zone of the coastal State. 
 
(d) the interests of Parties whose vessels engaged in SBT fishing (including 
those which have historically engaged in such fishing and those which have 
southern bluefin tuna fisheries under development); 
 
- 
the historical fishing record needs to be considered and accumulated 
retrospectively to the earliest year assessed for the stock assessment. 
(proceeding 1960). 
 
- 
the catch caught by the Parties’ vessels should be assessed as its own 
catch record even if they were engaged in joint ventures. 
 
- 
the interests of Parties under development (new Party etc.) must not 
undermine the interests of the current Parties. 
 
(e) the contribution to conservation, enhancement and scientific research; 
 
• Conservation 
 
- 
the contribution of the current Parties should be considered on an equal 
basis. The future catch record for the new Party should be adjusted 
considering the efforts which the current Parties have made to the 
conservation and management actions. 
 
- 
the time the Parties’ industries have spent in industry to industry 
cooperation and their scientific contributions should be assessed. 
 
• Enhancement 
 
- 
the time the Parties have spent and their scientific contribution should be 
assessed. 
 
• Research 
 
- 
priority should be given to the assessment of the Party which has 
presented catch and effort data used for the scientific stock assessment. 
 
- 
efforts to assist in identifying the solution of stock assessment 
uncertainties should be assessed. 
 
(2) Weighting of the factors to be considered. 
 
There is no specific provision in the Convention. 
 
4. 
Example from other international fishery organisations. 
 
The following is the criteria and weighting scheme for the catch allocation in the 
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) which consists of many Parties and 
has a stock conservation management record covering a long period. 
 
(1) The criteria for the allocation covers 
 
(a) Parties interests; 
 
(b) Historical catch record; 
 
(c) Parties’ degree of dependence on the coastal community; 
 
(d) Cooperation in monitoring and inspection; 
 
(e) Cooperation in stock conservation. 
 
(2) Weighting 
 
• 
Each Party’s catch record for the previous 20 years................40% 
• 
Each Party’s catch record for the previous 5 years..................40% 
• 
Interests of the coastal States...................................................10% 
• 
New Parties or others...............................................................10%

Management Strategy 
 
The development of a management strategy for the global SBT fishery is a vital 
component of the Commission's work. A mid-term management strategy was developed 
in 1992 under the former informal management arrangement which set goals for 
management and outlined the actions which would be taken to achieve progress towards 
those goals. 
 
The Commission commenced work on a management strategy for the SBT fishery in 
1994, with subsequent exchanges of view amongst the parties during 1994 and 1995. To 
maintain the momentum on this important issue, Australia proposes the following 
course of action: 
 
(a) Australia to prepare a paper setting out elements for inclusion in a revised draft 
 
management strategy, taking into account the papers and responses already 
 
prepared and recent developments in the SBT stock assessment. 
 
(b) Japan and New Zealand to provide comments on the Australian paper within eight 
 
weeks of receiving it. 
 
(c) Australia to prepare a revised paper taking into account the comments from Japan 
 
and New Zealand. 
 
(d) The Commission to convene a workshop during the first half of 1997 for 
 
collaborative work on development of a management strategy, to report to the 4th 
 
Annual Meeting of the Commission using the revised Australian paper as a 
 
working document.

Joint Pilot Plan for Experimental Fishing Program for SBT 
Fisheries Agency of Japan 
 
August 19,1996  
 
I. 
Introduction 
 
 
Substantial differences have been observed in assessment of southern bluefin tuna 
stock by Japan, Australia and New Zealand. It has been pointed out that one of the 
major causes of such differences was in the models dealing with CPUE used for VPA 
tuning (Report on Workshop on Developing a Framework for Evaluating the Impact of 
Experimental Fishing on the SBT Stock. May - June, 1996). This is a problem arising 
from the fact that, as compared with the scope of the fishing grounds in the 1970s and 
1980s when more flexible operation took place under the larger TAC. the scopes of 
fishing activities have been limited both in terms of time and space in recent years as a 
result of introduction of lower catch quotas, coupled with the improvement of CPUE for 
lower-age fishes. In other words, in order to use CPUE as an abundance index, it was 
necessary to maintain yearly consistency and this encouraged scientists of Japan, 
Australia and Zealand to propose differing approaches to obtain better abundance 
indices representative of both areas fished continuously and not fished in recent years. 
The unverified approaches are used for stock assessment, although they are still in the 
stage of hypotheses. 
 
 
At present there are following hypotheses (models) with regard to the dealings of 
CPUE: 
1. 
Constant square (Spatial extent remains constant between years. Stock area has 
been defined as the area fished over all years.) 
2. 
Variable square (Spatial extent varies between years. The density of fish outside a 
fished area in a year is assumed to be zero.) 
3. 
B ratio (Spatial extent remains constant between years. However, CPUE in an area 
fished is assumed to be higher than that in an area not fished.) 
4. 
B min (Spatial extent remains constant between years. The density in regions not 
fished is assumed to be a small value.) 
5. 
B habitant (Spatial extent remains constant between years. The CPUE in a area not 
fished is set equal to a value which is a function of both the average CPUE in the 
area fished and the spatial extent of that area.) 
 
For this reason, the Government of Japan proposed an experimental fishing 
program (EFP) before the first special meeting of the CCSBT held in January 1996 with 
a view to clarifying the issues surrounding CPUE. Also, Australia submitted two plans 
to the Workshop at Shimizu, Japan in May - June 1996. However, no solid views were 
obtained on the assessment of effects on the stock of the each plans of experimental 
fishing at the Workshop, which aimed, it was hoped, to clarify much of the uncertainty 
in stock assessment. Although the implementation of the EFP will be discussed in line 
with the agreed timetable stand after the Second Special Meeting of the Commission, 
the present pilot plan is intended to test feasibility of these experimented surveys and 
their effectiveness, and improve EFP with a view to realizing full-scale implementation 
of the survey possible. In the pilot plan, the Japanese proposal and the Australian 
proposal (one of the two which focuses on the comparison of areas) will be 
implemented in parallel. 
 
Furthermore, in order to have the three countries benefiting from the survey bear 
the cost of the survey and to ensure its transparency, it is indispensable that the survey is 
conducted jointly by three countries. 
 
II. Objectives 
 
The objectives of the EFP are to obtain data from the area and period from which 
data have not been available due to shrinkage of fishing grounds and to contribute to 
dissolving the uncertainties surrounding the hypotheses to dealing with CPUE needed 
for stock assessment. In the pilot plan, the practicability (whether the appropriate data 
can be obtained) and effectiveness (whether the data obtained serve for the verification 
of the hypothesis and contribute to the improvement of stock assessment) of the 
proposed EFP of Japan and Australia should be examined with a view to improve them. 
 
In the first part of the surrey (based the original Japanese proposal), efforts will be 
made to reproduce the past operational patterns, as much as possible, with participating 
vessels operating the given areas as freely as possible. Verification work shall be made 
to determine from the obtained data which hypotheses are most suitable to maintain 
yearly consistency of CPUE data as an abundance index. 
 
In the second pant of the survey (based on one of the two Australian proposals), the 
areas which now constitute the fishing grounds (composed of 5x5 statistic areas) and 
those around them which are no longer fishing grounds at present are selected. The 
survey is intended to assess the hypothesis by determining the relative value of CPUE in 
the two sets of areas through the operation of participating vessels in these areas and 
compare this with the relative value for the same two sets in 1980. 
 
Both the Japanese and Australian proposals have their strengths and possible 
weaknesses and comparison of the results from the two parts of the survey in the pilot 
plan will hopefully determine which of these will prove more effective. The pilot plan 
will be continued in case the estimation of the variations in annual catchability is 
necessary. 
 
III. Survey method 
 
1. 
Survey, Part 1 
 
1) 
Survey period 
 
The fourth quarter is the period in which surveys can be smoothly implemented as 
soon as this year’s annual Commission meeting makes a decision on this matter. In 
addition, fishing vessels can participate in the survey easily in this period. For these 
reasons, the survey period will be set for October-December 1996. After the 
implementation of the survey Part 1, the pilot plan can be improved if scientists of three 
countries determine it necessary to do so in the light of the results of the first survey. 
The pilot plan can be repeated in 1997 in case the scientists of the three countries 
considered it necessary. 
 
2) 
The survey area will be set for Areas 7 and 8 (Fig. 1). 
 
Areas 7 and 8 had the largest harvests in the past operations. Areas 7 and 8 were 
selected as the survey area because the greatest difference in abundance index can be 
found between the CPUE hypotheses of Japan and Australia (Fig. 2) in those areas and 
is fairly compact area with small east-west extent. Both areas will be divided into two 
subareas; the consistent fishing ground (Subarea A), and the past fishing ground 
(Subarea B). The total area (Subarea A plus Subarea B) will be based on 1969-1995 data 
as the scope in order to secure the consistency with the constant square model. 
1991-1995 data will be used as the scope for Subarea A in Area 7 and 1994-1995 data 
will be used as the scope for Subarea A in Area 8. 
 
3) 
The method of fishing vessel deployment 
 
As there could be the following two options, the Scientific Committee will discuss 
merits and demerits of them. 
 
Plan I: 
The deployment of fishing vessels is to be implemented under the control of each 
member state. However, in order to maintain the consistency with the data obtained in 
the past, the operation will be carried out in line with the ordinary commercial patterns 
of the participating vessels. 
 
Plan II: 
The number of operations by area (7 and 8) and by month (Oct. to Dec.) in Subarea 
A and B will be calculated from the data of 1969-95. Participating vessels will be 
designated into Areas 7 and 8 and days by Subareas will be allocated to vessels based 
on the past ratio of operations. Details are show in Item 5). 
 
4) 
Survey items 
 
a) 
Catch of SBT and fishing efforts made for the catch 
b) 
length and weight composition of SBT 
c) 
Species composition of catch 
d) 
Collection and preservation of stomach content specimens of SBT 
 
5) 
Necessary quota and the number of participating vessels 
 
The quota needed will be *** tons and the number of longline vessels to be used will 
be ***. These figures have been estimated through the following methods. The number of 
operations needed to estimate the CPUE ratio of Subarea A and B (B CPUE/A CPUE)  
in a precision of CV=0.1 or above in a given area will be obtained, through the bootstrap 
method using the 1980 commercial fishing data. The results are multiplied by the number 
of areas and months to estimate the number of vessels and quota needed. The quota 
should not be allocated to each vessel as individual quota in order to ensure the operation 
patterns of around 1980. In this case, number of operations (i.e. number of vessels and 
period of operations) is an essential factor. We multiplied the number of operations by 
assumed catch rate of 0.5t/day as an estimator of catch quota. 
 
2. 
Survey, Part II 
 
1) 
Survey period 
 
October-December 1996. The pilot plan will be extended in case the scientists of 
the three countries considered it necessary.  
 
2) 
Survey area 
 
The fishing grounds have been reduced substantially as compared with 1980. The 
survey area will be designated in Area 8 which is deemed to be useful for comparison 
through surveys. (However, this does not exclude the possibility of carrying out surveys 
in other areas that show higher practical feasibility, with the participation of Australia 
and/or New Zealand.) Two blocks (5*5) each will be selected in the central operation 
areas in the recent years (Subarea A) and in area in which operation took place only in 
the past (Subarea B). This will be selected without any regard to the EEZs. 
 
3) 
Survey items 
 
Same as proposed for the Part I (or add some items from the original Australian 
proposal). 
 
4) 
The method of fishing vessel deployment 
 
The participating vessels will be divided into four groups and rotate at an interval 
of half month. Assuming the areas of the central fishing grounds as A1 and A2 and the 
past operation areas as B1 and B2, one group rotates as from A1 and B1 (first month) to 
A2 and B2 (second months), and A1 and B1 (third months). (This is close to the original 
proposal but it could produce bias depending on the vessel capability.) 
 
5) 
Necessary quota and the number of participating vessels 
 
The quota needed will be *** tons and the number of longline vessels employed 
will be ***. These figures have been estimated through the following methods. The 
number of operations needed to maintain the CPUE precision at CV=0.1 in a given 
block is estimated to be 25 operations, using the 1980 commercial catch data. Then 25 
operations are multiplied by the number of blocks, months, and 0.5 ton (catch rate) to 
estimate the number of vessels and quota needed. 
 
 
IV. Allocation of sampling quota for Part I and Part II of the survey 
 
With respect to this allocation, it should be noted that there is a need to give full 
consideration to the commercial and economic aspects of the participating vessels 
especially in the Part II survey. 
 
V. Effects on the stock 
 
The stringent criterion requiring that there should be no substantial negative effect 
on recovery prospects as a result of a proposed experimental catch in all the options 
employed in the stock assessments by Japan and Australia is not necessary at all times. 
(After all, were this the case, there could be no objection to increase the normal TAC by 
this amount). 
 
Calculation of the restoration probability and assessment by means of VPA models 
of the two countries, as to be modified in the coming Scientific Committee, will be 
made, using the three countries' weighted average of the input data obtained at the 1996 
Shimizu Workshop (or as may be updated at the Scientific Committee this year). (The 
calculation results at the present stage concerning the case of 3, 000 tons will be a 
reduction by 19% in the worst case.)  
 
Furthermore. after the implementation of the pilot survey, assessment of its effect 
will be made by means of the VPA models of the two countries using the data obtained 
to that point (commercial catch data and the data obtained from the survey). If (though 
Japan considers this very unlikely) the adverse effects are confirmed and the obtained 
data were found insufficient from the scientific point of view, the three countries will 
reduce their quota from the next fishing season onward in accordance with an 
appropriate quantity based on the assessment. 
 
VI. Boarding of observers 
 
As many observers as possible will be allocated onboard the survey vessels, with a 
provisional (or intended) target coverage of 10%. 
 
VII. Utilization of pilot survey results 
 
The data obtained from the pilot plan will be used for designing the full-scale 
experimental fishing program and its effective implementation.

Japanese Proposal for a Joint Pilot Plan for 
Experimental Fishing Program for SBT 
(Australia’s comments) 
 
11 September 1996 
 
Summary 
 
Australia has attempted to evaluate the Joint Pilot Plan for Experimental Fishing 
Program for SBT against the criteria given in the “Objectives and principles for the 
design and implementation of an experimental fishing program” developed by the 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT). While Australia 
recognises that a Pilot Program may of necessity be simple and exploratory in design, 
there was not enough information provided for the risks and benefits of the Japanese 
proposal to be assessed effectively. 
 
Australia has many questions concerning the proposal. The proposal, as presented, does 
not describe how the data collected would be used to scientifically test the alternative 
hypotheses identified. Questions concerning (i) exactly how the information obtained 
will be used in the stock assessment, (ii) the types of analyses that will be conducted 
with the data and (iii) the way in which extra information will improve the stock 
assessment need to be addressed. 
 
Based on recent risk assessments carried out by the Scientific Committee, it is apparent 
that taking additional catch from the SBT stock significantly affects the probability of 
recovery to 1980 levels by the year 2020. It is Australia’s view that it is difficult to 
justify taking higher risks with an already heavily overfished stock when the benefits 
have not been clearly identified. 
 
Two important questions have to be answered. The first is how much of the total 
uncertainty of the current stock assessment would be reduced if the CPUE interpretation 
problem was resolved and secondly, whether there are more effective methods to 
achieve this instead of experimental fishing? Simply having more data with the same 
confounding effects between fishery targeting and fish distribution is not likely to allow 
resolution of the effect of these on the interpretation of CPUE, especially the historical 
CPUE. 
 
Australia, never-the-less, remains positive to the development of experimental fishing 
and adaptive management approaches which can deliver statistically and scientifically 
valid results and facilitates the achievement of fishery management objectives. 
 
Introduction 
 
The “Joint Pilot Experimental Fishing Program for SBT” proposal (hereafter referred to 
as the Pilot Program) was provided by the Fisheries Agency of Japan on August 19, 
1996. Australia undertook to provide comments on the document by 11 September 
1996. 
 
First, Australia consider that the Pilot Program should not be discussed in detail until the 
Commission decides whether it should go ahead or not. In the meantime, the following 
is a summary of Australia’s preliminary comments. 
 
Comments are based on Australia’s view is that a well-designed and well evaluated 
adaptive management experimental program can be an important tool for reducing 
uncertainty in the assessment of stock status and improving future management. 
However, it must not jeoparadise the recovery (defined in terms of the probability of 
returning to 1980s spawning stock size by 2020) of SBT parental spawning and must 
provide demonstrable benefits for future management. 
 
The “Objectives and principles for the design and implementation of an experimental 
fishing program” (Anon, 1996a) developed by the Commission for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) provided a set of criteria on which to base our 
comments. 
 
1. 
Any experimental fishing program’s aim should be to reduce uncertainty in 
the stock assessment and projections as far as possible. 
 
The pilot Program states that its objectives are “to obtain data from the area and period 
from which data have not been available due to shrinkage of fishing grounds and to 
contribute to dissolving the uncertainties surrounding the hypotheses to dealing with 
CPUE needed for stock assessments”. 
 
In our opinion, these objectives are back-to-front. The objective of a scientific study is 
not to obtain data as an end in itself, but rather it is to use the collected data to answer 
specific questions. The logical steps are (i) determine which uncertainty will be reduced, 
(ii) determine how big the reduction will be and (iii) decide on what data are needed to 
achieve this. 
 
As well as the interpretation of CPUE there are several other important sources of 
uncertainty in the current assessment. These include the age specific natural mortality 
rate, the relative reliability of CPUE as a measure of abundance for different age groups, 
the fishing mortality in recent years, the interpretation of the “plus” group CPUE, 
methods for initiating the “plus” group, and the relationship between fishing effort and 
fishing mortality. Current stock assessment and projection techniques can be used to 
determine what effect the removal of uncertainty in the interpretation of CPUE has on 
the overall assessment. Australia would also like to see an examination of other ways of 
reducing uncertainty (eg. the use of tagging experiments or modeling of changes in 
fishery operations) 
 
2. 
The development, evaluation and the analysis of the result of the experimental 
fishing program should be collaborative and agreed between all parties. 
 
The Pilot Program has attempted in incorporate previous Experimental Fishing 
Proposals (EFPs) put forward by Japan and Australia. However, in doing this it has 
ended up with two different survey methods both attempting to achieve the same 
objective. This results in having to double the catch needed to conduct the experiment. 
The advantages and disadvantages of the two survey plans could be evaluated from 
existing data and knowledge of fishing patterns along with an analysis of the degree of 
uncertainty that will be resolved using either plan. Simply adopting both plans puts 
increased pressure on the stock and does not represent true collaboration and amongst 
all parties. 
 
The overall aim of the proposal appears to be collect information that will be used to 
design a full-scale experimental fishing program and its effective implementation. 
Australia is interested in how the information from the pilot study would be used to 
evaluate whether a full-scale program is, in fact, justified or feasible. It is also keen to 
see analyses of how the data from the pilot will be used to optimise the design of a 
full-scale program. 
 
The proposal makes no mention of who would own and have access to the data from the 
experiment, and who would conduct the analysis of these. It is Australia’s view that the 
results would have to be available to all parties and detailed collaborative analyses 
would have to be carried our before any further decision were made. 
 
3. 
The development and implementation of any program should not adversely 
impact on the process of conducting the annual stock assessment or the 
Commission’s agreed program of other scientific work, recognising that the 
Commission may need to vary its agreed work program as priorities change. 
 
The Pilot Program has already been a problem for the 1996 Scientific Committee 
process, where the integrity and scientific focus on the annual stock assessment was, in 
Australia’s view, compromised by the proposed addition of the consideration of EFP 
onto the 1996 Committee’s agenda. Australian scientists believe that a consideration of 
any EFP is a substantive issue and should be handled by specific meetings for that 
purpose to prevent erosion of the limited time available for the Scientific Committee to 
conduct core stock assessment work. 
 
4. 
That any increase in catch, recommended above the current TAC to 
accommodate experimental fishing should not jeopardise the potential recovery of 
the parental stock to the 1980 level by 2020, or undermine other agreed 
management objectives. 
 
The proposal should show why it is not possible to conduct the experiment within the 
existing quota. Japan places very high weight on interpretations of CPUE that imply 
average fish abundance in the area recently not fished, and is strongly of the view that 
extensive stock recovery is under-way. If these interpretations are correct, the economic 
risk of conducting the experiment within existing quota is low and quite feasible. 
 
It is not clear from the proposal how much extra catch is needed, or what basis the 
calculation was made. The proposal suggests calculating the number of operations 
needed “to maintain the CPUE precision at CV=0.1”. 
 
More detailed information on what this means is required (eg. how was this CV 
estimated; what was the basis for using 10%; what does it mean that 10% be 
maintained; and over what temporal and spatial scales is a 10% CV going to be 
maintained?) Further questions such as the scientific implications of other levels of 
catch and precision also need to be addressed. Rather than calculating samples size in 
terms of the simple level of precision of the CPUE, consideration of the statistical 
power to resolve the alternative hypothesis is needed. 
 
Without a clear specification of the management decision rule to be applied at the end of 
the experiment, it is difficult to evaluate the risk to the stock. An inconclusive 
experiment combined with no decision rule could be expected to result in continued 
experimental catch being sought. Therefore, scenario 3 (see Table) is probably the best 
scenario on which to base assessment of risks. In Australia’s view, the probability of 
recovery, even under current catches, is low and of considerable concern. Additional 
catch further decrease the probability of recovery (see Table). In these circumstances, 
the scientific justification for an increase in catch to support experimental fishing would 
need to be very strong.

Perhaps, attempts should be made to minimise the impact on the stock by designing an 
experiment which builds on the more extensive coverage presently existing in quarters 2 
and 3 and taking a lesser catch. Other possible ways of minimising impact on the stock 
while maximising benefits include experimental fishing on the spawning grounds to 
reduce uncertainties surrounding the “plus” group. 
 
5 
That any experimental fishing program should be designed to deliver 
scientifically valid and meaningful results and that it should be designed for 
implementation by commercial fishing vessels. 
 
The Pilot Program is clearly designed for commercial fishing vessels but it is not clear 
that is will deliver scientifically valid and meaningful results. As well as combining two 
experimental plans as discussed above, the Pilot Program contains two components. The 
first is to expand the time of fishing into the fourth quarter of the year. The second is to 
expand fishing into previously fished areas which are no longer fished. 
 
The reason given for extending the temporal cover is that “fishing vessels can 
participate in the survey easily in this period”. No scientific rationale is given to 
demonstrate that the choice of the fourth quarter is the best way to achieve the objective 
of reducing uncertainty. In fact, there are several reasons why the choice of the fourth 
quarter may produce results which are confounded by a range of other factors. The 
confounding factors include: 
• 
changes in the availability of stock in this quarter as the adult fish move away from 
the experimental area to spawn; 
• 
changes in targeting as a result of the spawning migration (either increased 
targeting or avoidance); and 
• 
lack of spatial coverage in the historical time series in the quarter. 
 
As an extra practical commercial consideration, October/December does not fit in with 
the Australian Industry’s normal fishing program. It is likely that any collaborative 
program would have to include November/March and Jun/August to be acceptable. 
 
With respect to the spatial coverage, the Pilot Program identifies four regions in 
Statistical Areas 7 and 8 for the experiment. The focus on Area 7 and 8 is questionable 
as these areas only border on current fishing regions. For testing the hypotheses 
concerning the interpretation of CPUE, Area 3, 4 and 2 would be more appropriate as 
the changes in fishing pattern in these areas have been more marked. 
 
Even with Area 7 and 8, because these areas are very large (up to 21 5x5-degree areas in 
size), Australia would like to know whether any analyses have been carried out on 
which 5x5 degree squares have or have not been previously fished. This could lead to 
the identification of a core fishing area and 5x5 degree squares with a previous high 
CPUE (or otherwise) so that additional effort can be targeted in the areas where the 
uncertainty is highest. Specification of how the additional effort (and catch) is to be 
allocated across the 5x5 blocks is also is needed to determine what sampling precision 
can be achieved within each block. 
 
The proposal states that “vessels will operates as freely as possible” and “will be carried 
out in line with ordinary commercial practices”. Simply having more data from these 
ordinary commercial practices is unlikely to resolve uncertainty regarding CPUE 
interpretations. It is recognised that there is a need for some trade-off between 
commercial needs and scientific rigour, but a pilot proposal that lacks specification of 
an experimental design (in a scientific and statistical sense) ignores the central basis of 
scientific methodology. 
 
6. 
There should be appropriate monitoring of any program, designed and 
conducted in a collaborative manner amongst parties. 
 
The proposal does not relate the level of monitoring to the scientific needs of the 
experiment. The proposal mentions “a provisional (or intended) target” of 10% observer 
coverage. Much more specific and binding commitments for collaborative verification 
are needed. Verification of the data is a critical issue, and without adequate verification 
the experimental results will be open to a wide range of interpretations – possibly even 
increasing uncertainty in the stock assessments from the present levels. 
 
A high level of observer coverage is likely be required given that experimental fishing 
effort will probably be small in a large number of area/time strata, and that essential 
aspects of the data can only be collected by observers. If such an experiment is to go 
ahead, Australia also believes that VMS should be used for position fixing on all vessels 
at all times. 
 
In summary, if the proposal is to be evaluated scientifically, the following questions are 
pertinent: 
• 
what are the hypotheses to be tested? 
• 
what methods are to be used for testing the hypotheses? 
• 
what is the statistical power of the proposed experiment to distinguish the 
hypotheses (including type I and II error rates)? 
• 
how would the results of the experiment be used to aid interpretation of the 
historical CPUE? 
• 
what reduction in uncertainty in the assessments would occur if the hypotheses can 
be resolved? 
 
Other Issues 
 
Other issues which need to be considered include mitigation methods for albatross 
bycatch, eg. night setting, thawed bait, bait throwers etc. 
 
Data collected during the survey should also include: 
• 
collection of biological samples, in addition to stomach contents, of SBT (eg. 
otoliths, gonads); 
• 
details of the targeting and fishing methods; 
• 
details of the by-catch, in addition to a species list, including numbers of 
individuals, weight estimates and biological samples as required for scientific 
analysis.

New Zealand Comments on Japan's Proposal for an EFP Pilot 
 
New Zealand has considered Japan's proposal for a pilot Experimental Fishing 
Programme to be considered by the CCSBT Meeting in Canberra. While our comments 
should not be regarded as exhaustive they represent the main areas of concern this 
proposal raises. We consider that should the Commission decide to proceed with step 3 
of the EFP process agreed at the second special meeting that many of these concerns 
could be addressed in light of specific areas of uncertainty in the SBT stock assessment 
 
New Zealand acknowledges that, in principle, an Experimental Fishing Programme 
(EFP) is one way to reduce some sources of uncertainty in the SBT stock assessment.  
We also recognise that an appropriately designed EFP has the potential to provide 
supplementary biological material that could aid in the interpretation of SBT biology 
and ecology, and therefore directly or indirectly assist in the population dynamics 
modelling undertaken by Commission scientists. 
 
It is also our view that to efficiently implement a full EFP, it may be necessary to 
conduct a pilot programme to test design aspects of any agreed EFPs and to resolve any 
operational details. New Zealand supports the development of Commission EFPs 
including a pilot programme within the framework agreed by the Second Special 
Meeting of the CCSBT in May 1996. The specific conditions of an EFP, set out 
Attachments C, D, and E of that meeting's report, in our view apply equally to a fully 
implemented EFP and to any pilot EFP. New Zealand has concerns that the pilot 
proposal by Japan does not adequately meet the agreed objectives and principles set out 
in those attachments. 
 
From a procedural perspective, a pilot programme (by definition) is intended to precede 
a fully implemented EFP, as such it should be structured to test various experimental 
design aspects of the full programme to insure the objectives of the full EFP can be met 
and done so in an efficient manner. However, since we have yet to consider step 3 of the 
EFP process as was agreed, we do not yet have agreement on what the full EFP should 
be designed to do or whether the risk to the stock, as assessed in step 2, is sufficiently 
low to justify an EFP. We are unsure whether Japan's pilot programme would be an 
appropriate precursor to the type of EFP all parties could agree to because we have yet 
to discuss the outcomes of steps 1 and 2 and agree to progress with step 3 of the EFP 
process. As a consequence, consideration of a pilot programme seems premature since 
we have not agreed on what would be an acceptable risk nor have we agreed on the 
objectives of an EFP. 
 
New Zealand has several concerns about Japan's proposal. The following points 
summarise our concern that the pilot programme preempts consideration by the 
Commission of what would be the most appropriate EFP and that it would not 
significantly contribute to reducing the uncertainty in the stock assessments: 
 
1. 
It is not clear what data will be gathered or how it will be analysed so as to  
 
 
distinguish between the five CPUE hypothesis identified. The pilot is 
described in  this context as a test of the "feasibility of these experimental surveys and 
their  
effectiveness" but no specifics are given on how feasibility or effectiveness 
will be  evaluated. This omission makes it appear to be a programme whose 
effectiveness  
can only be gauged after it has been completed. In this it lacks 
sufficient structure  
to ensure that the stated objectives can be met. 
 
2. 
The stated objective of gathering data from the fourth quarter because of shrinkage 
 
of the fishing ground does not seem like a suitable objective for reducing the 
 
uncertainty in the stock assessment. This quarter is not used in the assessment 
 
because it has not been fished for a long time. Also at the recent Scientific 
 
Committee one paper clearly showed that the inclusion or exclusion of quarter 4 
 
data made almost no difference to the overall CPUE trend. Based on the CPUE 
 
hypotheses listed the proposal clearly indicates that spatial rather than temporal 
 
changes in catch rate are the focus of the proposed pilot EFP. It is therefore unclear 
 
to us why fishing should be done in quarter 4 when the CPUE uncertainty arises 
 
from the data coming from quarter 2 and 3. 
 
3. 
The choice of survey area is related to the choice of quarters fished and clearly 
 
needs to be linked to agreed EFP objectives, the areas proposed may or may not be 
 
the most appropriate depending on what are considered to be the most important 
 
objectives of an EFP. Given the uncertainty about the plus-group, for instance, it 
 
may be most appropriate to determine the age composition of SBT on the spawning 
 
grounds. If this were chosen as the most appropriate objective of an EFP then this 
 
would suggest an EFP pilot in quarter 4 in area 1. 
 
4. 
The proposal does not specifically identify either the number of vessels or the 
 
tonnage of SBT required to meet the objectives. However, the reference to o
 
btaining estimates with a CV of 10% suggests considerable effort and by extension 
 
a large tonnage especially for a pilot programme. We question why such a low CV 
 
has been chosen. We also question the reasonableness of designing an experiment 
 
assuming a catch rate of 0.5 tonnes per day based on 1980 catch statistics. 
 
5. 
The objectives state that "efforts will be made to reproduce the past operational 
 
patterns, as much as possible, with participating vessels operating in the given 
 
areas as freely as possible". Given the technological and gear changes, changes in 
 
crew composition, etc that have been discussed in various CCSBT meetings an 
 
unrestricted fishing plan does not seem appropriate. In our view careful 
 
consideration needs to be given to determine if fishing activities could be 
 
structured to mimic an earlier period of the SBT fishery. Unrestricted fishing plans 
 
would not be expected to be sufficient. 
 
6. 
The data to be collected seems to be unduly limited and does not reflect what we 
 
consider to be the most important for advancing the Commission's scientific 
 
objectives. We see no reason why stomach content analysis would be given high 
 
priority or why otolith collection for example would be omitted. We believe that a 
 
broader range of activities, including additional tagging experiments, needs to be 
 
considered as an adjunct to any such proposal. 
 
7. 
The level of data verification proposed (10% observer coverage) needs to be 
 
justified in relation to the precision required to detect a given difference between 
 
the hypotheses being tested. Intuitively the proposed level seems inadequate. 
 
8. 
We have agreed (attachment C, Objectives and Principles para 4) that any catch 
 
above the current TAC for an EFP should not jeopardise the potential for parental 
 
biomass recovery. Japan's proposal reinterprets the agreement between the parties 
 
as to what would be acceptable regarding the additional risk any EFP or pilot EFP 
 
might pose to stock recovery. We are very concerned that this reinterpretation 
 
seems to imply that contrary to our agreement it is sometimes not only acceptable 
 
for an EFP to jeopardise the potential for parental biomass recovery but also that 
 
"substantial negative effects" may also be acceptable. 
 
New Zealand reiterates its willingness to advance measures to reduce uncertainty in 
SBT stock assessments including consideration of an appropriate cooperatively 
developed and implemented EFP which can be shown to have a reasonable expectation 
of meeting its agreed objectives and which does not jeopardise the potential recovery of 
the stock to 1980 levels. We also recognise that an appropriately designed EFP should 
provide additional information on SBT biology and ecology that will assist in the 
population dynamics modelling undertaken by Commission scientists. In our view the 
EFP pilot proposal does not meet these criteria.
