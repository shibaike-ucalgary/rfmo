Report of the Extended Commission of the 
Fourteenth Annual Meeting of the Commission 
16-19 October 2007 
Canberra, Australia

Agenda Item 2. 
Independent observer participation at CCSBT 14 
10. Australia noted that although observers have participated for many years as members 
of delegations, they have been allowed to participate for the first time in the annual 
meeting of the CCSBT in their own right.  Australia hoped that this would be the 
start of a long term trend for allowing observer participation and improving 
transparency of the CCSBT. 
11. Japan welcomed participation from independent observers and noted that Article 14 
of the CCSBT Convention and Rule 3 of the CCSBT Rules of Procedure related to 
Observers and that these rules should be followed. 
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Handling confidential matters concerning the CCSBT 
12. Japan commented that a former director of Australian Fisheries Management 
Authority in 2006 and CSIRO scientists in 2007 infringed the confidentiality 
arrangements of the Extended Commission.  This infringement by an Australian 
official and scientists has made discussion of compliance issues difficult.  Japan 
would like Australia to improve its national system to protect matters that are treated 
confidential by the CCSBT and would like to know how Australia is progressing in 
these matters.  Japan advised that unless confidentiality is strictly observed, it will be 
difficult to engage in discussion and to make progress in compliance measures which 
involve exchange of confidential information among Members. 
13. Australia noted that there have been similar problems in relation to confidentiality 
with items appearing in the Japanese media relating to confidential matters. These 
include an article arising from a visit to Port Lincoln by officials from the JFA and 
Japanese industry (Suisan Keizai Shimbun, 11 April 2006) and this article included 
false claims and photographs.  These photographs include one which appeared in the 
JFA report of their trip to Port Lincoln.  This was particularly troubling as JFA 
officials had stated prior to the trip, that they would abide by the confidentiality rules 
of CCSBT in relation to the trip. Another article in the Japanese media reported on 
the confidential Japanese Market Review including the amount of overcatch 
estimated by the review (Suisan Keizai Shimbun, 30 July 2006).  These breaches 
raise a range of issues in relation to confidentiality that would benefit from further 
discussions among Members. 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Report from the Secretariat 
14. Members noted the report from the Secretariat.  There were no comments on the 
report. 
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Finance and Administration 
3 
15. The Executive Secretary briefly introduced papers CCSBT-EC/07010/05 (2007 
Revised Budget) and CCSBT-EC/07010/06 (2008 draft budget). Detailed 
consideration of these papers was referred to the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC). 
16. The FAC was convened to consider the revised budget for 2007 and the proposed 
budget for 2008 including the Special Budget. New Zealand was nominated to 
continue as chair of the FAC and Australia acted as rapporteur. 
17. The Executive Secretary provided the FAC with a further version of CCSBT-
EC/0710/05 (2007 Revised Budget) dated 16 October 2007 which corrected errors in 
the initial paper. 
 
5.1 Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
18. The FAC noted that the figures in the revised budget for 2007 are now such that a 
final position can be projected with confidence. The Executive Secretary was tasked 
to undertake urgent work to provide the necessary detail and having received that 
detail, the FAC is now satisfied that a budget surplus of $61,457 is anticipated for 
2007 and will be available for carry forward to the 2008 budget. 
19. The FAC also noted with concern that the accounting practices of the Secretariat 
lacked the sophistication necessary to facilitate appropriate financial management 
and reporting.  
20. The FAC further noted with concern that audited financial reports for 2006 were not 
made available to Members until late September 2007. Financial Regulation 3.5 
requires that audited financial statements be made available by 1 March each year 
and accurate budgets 60 days before the annual meeting.  
21. The Executive Secretary explained that a new accountant had recently been 
employed, however the FAC believes that formal quarterly reporting by the 
Executive Secretary to Members would provide more rigour and transparency. It is 
recommended that the following reports be made available at the end of each quarter: 
• Balance Sheet; 
• Profit and Loss Statement; 
• Variance Report (including unpaid commitments and actions taken to rectify); and 
• Cash Reserve Report.  
22. The Executive Secretary further explained that the Extended Commission faced a 
solvency crisis in September and October 2007 because of unpaid Member 
contributions. At the commencement of CCSBT14, $227,264 remains unpaid and 
$4,260 of this relates to the 2005 financial year. 
23. The FAC noted that the late payment of Member contributions places significant 
stress on the cash resources of the Secretariat and it also deprives the Extended 
Commission of investment income. Having said that, the FAC accepted that the 
financial arrangements in some Member countries precluded payments early in the 
4 
year, however, Members’ attention is drawn to Rule 5.6 in the Financial Regulations 
for guidance with regard to when contributions are due. 
24. The Extended Commission accepted the revised general budget for 2007 as shown in 
Attachment 7a. 
25. The FAC notes that the revised general budget projects an under-spend of $61,457 
which can be carried forward to the 2008 general budget.  
26. The FAC also considered the revised special budget for 2007, noting a reduction of 
$14,522 in expected revenue and an increase of $35,352 in budgeted expenditure. 
The resulting increase in overall budget expenditure is $49,875 which is transferred 
to the 2007 General Budget as a new line item under the ‘Special Projects’ section. 
The Executive Secretary explained that variations in his report to the Extended 
Commission (CCSBT-EC/0710/05). 
27. The FAC expressed concern that while attempts were made to reduce the special 
budget in 2007, it in fact increased. The FAC recommends that the Secretariat use an 
open tender process (for tenders over $79,999) to allow better transparency in the 
procurement process, including a requirement for tenderers to provide details of the 
activities to be undertaken and costs. 
28. The Extended Commission accepted the revised special budget for 2007 as shown in 
Attachment 7a and agreed to the transfer of the over-spend of $49,875 to the 
general budget. 
29. The Extended Commission might consider repaying the 2007 Special Budget over-
spend of $49,875 from the 2008 Special Budget. Such a payment is not currently 
accounted for in the 2008 General Budget, however the FAC recommends that if it is 
approved it should be placed in the Staff Liabilities Trust A/c  line. 
30. The FAC considered the general budget proposed for 2008 and noted that: 
• The budget assumes no additional roles or major tasks for the Secretariat; 
• The budget is largely consistent with 2007 with reasonable allowance for 
inflationary cost increases; 
• An under-spend of $61,457 is carried forward from 2007; 
• An amount of $4,500 is included in the budget to cover Indonesia’s participation 
in CCSBT15; 
• The Science Committee ‘panel of experts’ should be restored to a panel of four 
and the SAG Chair should continue to attend the Science Committee and SAG 
meetings. Suitable allowance has been made for these items in the budget; 
• Secretariat attendance at meetings should be restricted to those meeting that 
provide direct and measurable benefit to the business of the Extended 
Commission and with this in mind the budget allocation for travel in 2008 is 
reduced. The Executive Secretary provided a list of possible meetings and the 
FAC identified four meetings that it considered indicative of the type of meeting 
where attendance by a member of the Secretariat might benefit the Extended 
Commission. Those meetings are: 
5 
o Intercessional CWP, Canada 
o Tuna RFMOs meeting for Executive Secretaries, Rome 
o 2nd FIRMS Tech WG and 5th FIRMS Steering Committee, Rome  
o Meeting Protec, Port Lincoln 
The FAC recommends that in future the Executive Secretary develop a fixed 
travel plan for consideration in the budget setting process but that some discretion 
be build in to provide appropriate flexibility. 
The FAC further recommends that if the Executive Secretary needs to exceed the 
proposed travel budget, he should submit a funding proposal for the consideration 
of Members intercessionally on a case-by-case basis. Such a funding proposal 
should indicate whether the extra travel costs can be absorbed within the approved 
budget. 
• The Executive Secretary’s comments in his Report to the Extended Commission 
(CCSBT-EC/0710/06) alert the Extended Commission to the growing contingent 
liability created through the ongoing accumulation of unrealised staff benefits. 
The Executive Secretary advises that current contingent liabilities are probably in 
the order of $100,000 and will increase by about $20,000 per annum. 
The FAC recommends that a Staff Liabilities Trust A/c be established and that a 
regular contribution be budgeted in future years to cover the amount of the annual 
liability.  
The FAC also notes that an initial payment of $40,000 has been budgeted in 2008, 
and recommends that if savings can be achieved in the sub-committee meetings 
area of the 2008 budget, those savings should also be transferred to the new Trust 
A/c. If no savings are realised then further budget allocations will be needed to 
bring the trust fund to an appropriate level. 
• An amount of $25,000 is budgeted for ‘miscellaneous translation of Commission 
and Committee reports’, however the FAC notes that the late submission of 
papers increases translation costs and encourages Members to meet submission 
deadlines if possible. 
• The training budget for Secretariat Staff has been increased to $5,000 and the 
Executive Secretary is encouraged to fully utilise it for the benefit of both the staff 
and the Extended Commission. 
• Some decisions of the Extended Commission resulted in increased costs which 
were incorporated in a revised budget; 
• Further decisions of the Extended Commission at this meeting that result in 
increased costs will require revision of the 2008 proposed budget or such 
additional activities could be funded from reserves held by the Secretariat; 
• The general budget as proposed will result in a 4.9% increase in Member 
contributions; and 
• The increase in contributions is within the Extended Commission agreed 
guidelines of 10%. 
6 
31. The Extended Commission accepted the general budget as proposed (noting that this 
will result in a 4.9% increase in Member contributions). The Extended Commission 
noted the FAC also recommended that contributions to the 2008 budget by Members 
be made as early as possible and encouraged Members to do so. 
32. The FAC considered the special budget proposed for 2008 (CCSBT SRP tagging 
program) and noted that: 
• On advice from the Science Committee, the Extended Commission has directed 
that the tagging programme will not operate in 2008; 
• The tagging programme is proposed to recommence in 2009; 
• The Financial Regulations are silent on the Extended Commission’s ability to 
redirect the special budget funding into other projects; and 
• Several proposals were advanced for the use of the special budget. 
 
5.2 Discussion on Finance Issues and adoption of the CCSBT budget 
33. In response to a question regarding the appropriate extent of cash reserves for the 
Extended Commission, the FAC Chair advised that this was discussed in the context 
of the 2007 situation where a cash reserve of approximately $300,000 was barely 
sufficient to prevent insolvency of the Extended Commission as a result of late 
payment by some Members.  Therefore, future reserves should be maintained at a 
level sufficient to cover such issues. 
34. The Extended Commission endorsed the report from the FAC and adopted the 
revised 2007 general budget and 2008 budget as shown in Attachment 7a.  In 
adopting the general budgets, the Extended Commission noted that the general and 
special budgets should be kept separate and therefore that the over-spend of $49,875 
in the 2007 special budget should be funded from the 2008 special budget. 
35. It was agreed that the special budget for 2008 would contain $49,875 (Attachment 
7b) to fund the over-spend from 2007, but there was no consensus to include any 
additional amount to fund research projects in 2008.  Australia commented that it 
would be prudent to transfer the $49,875 to the staff liability fund. 
36. Specific attention was drawn to paragraphs 21 and 27 to note that these changes in 
procedure (financial reporting to Members and contract tendering) will be 
implemented immediately.  Australia proposed that provision should be made in the 
special budget to fund essential and high priority projects identified by the ESC, 
namely the Indonesian Catch Monitoring Project, which characterization of catch 
amount and size structure, and the aerial survey, which is identified as the highest 
priority for a provisions recruitment index.  Both of these projects are currently 
funded by Australia. 
37. Australia noted their concerns that research projects identified as being high priority 
for the Extended Commission were not being funded. 
38. New Zealand indicated its support for funding agreed research projects from the 
special fund and noted a proposal to levy the fund and build cash reserves. 
7 
39. Japan, Taiwan and Korea noted that the current exchange rate between their 
currencies and the Australian dollar meant significant cost increases to them despite 
the general budget only increasing by 5%. 
40. It was generally agreed that if the ESC recommends continuation of tagging in 2009, 
the small special budget approved for 2008 would not be used as the basis of the 
10% rule in relation to acceptable levels of inter-annual budget variations, subject to 
budgetary constraints of each Member. 
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Review of SBT Fisheries 
6.1 Member reports 
41. Reports on the SBT fisheries of Members of the Extended Commission are provided 
at Attachment 8.   
42. Members were given the opportunity of asking questions in relation to the reports of 
others 
Questions on Japan’s report 
43. Australia welcomed the improvements in the management of the Japanese longline 
sector and hoped that an approach of continual improvement can be adopted that will 
result in all Members having confidence in the catch data in the future.  However, 
Australia questioned whether the figures provided by Japan in its national report 
should be used by the SAG and SC in the stock assessment.  Japan responded that it 
believed that the SAG and SC were using all available information including 
historical figures reported by Japan in order to conduct stock assessment. 
44. Australia asked what procedure was used to ensure that landing only occurs at the 8 
designated SBT landing ports in Japan.  Japan advised that the SBT brought in are 
below -40oC.  When fish are handled at these temperatures, appropriate freezer 
storage facilities are required and the size of port becomes critical.  Commercial 
ports are too large and fishing vessels do not enter.  There are only 8 ports that meet 
the necessary conditions.  In addition, each port has fishing cooperatives.  In the 
smaller ports, the local fishers bring in locally caught products.  If SBT came into 
such ports it would become immediately a news item and this does not happen.  
Furthermore, in the new management system, companies (i.e. buyers and sellers) that 
knowingly purchase or obtain illegally landed SBT will be subject to penalties. 
45. Australia requested information on the type of penalties that were imposed on the 12 
vessels that exceeded their quota in 2005.  Japan highlighted that this occurred 
before the introduction of its new management system starting from April 2006.  It 
also advised that the vessels were subjected to a period of suspension and the vessels 
were moored at ports under the observation of the Fisheries Agency of Japan.  The 
length of suspension was a period designed to provide an economic deterrent. 
46. Australia requested information on the number of vessels that had been inspected by 
patrol vessels that were deployed during the 2005 season as well as the cost of 
surveillance activities in the Japanese SBT fishery.  Japan responded that it would 
8 
provide information on the patrol vessels after the meeting, but that it did not break 
down its fishery surveillance costs on a specific tuna fishery basis, such as the SBT 
fishery.  Australia noted that some countries have different means of tracking costs 
and that Australia budgets compliance costs on a fishery by fishery basis.  Australia 
spends $1 million per annum on compliance in its SBT fishery and that Australia 
was able to provide a breakdown of the expenditure. 
47. New Zealand asked whether the addition of 69t of unused quota to Japan’s 2004 
quota was actually a carry forward of unused quota from one year to the next.  Japan 
advised that this was when voluntary quotas were set because of lack of agreement 
on the TAC and national allocation.  Therefore, the quota was not set under CCSBT 
rules. 
Questions on Australia’s report 
48. Japan noted that Australia had not conducted a selectivity study for the hooks used in 
its 40 fish sample and asked if Australia had any plans for the study.  Australia 
remarked that selectivity is a complex issue and that it had not conducted a specific 
study but that it was known that the specific hooks used caught a wide range of sizes 
from less that 10kg to greater than 40kg.  Australia noted that in conducting the 40 
fish sample, fish under 10kg are not counted and this biases the count up towards 
larger fish.  An independent expert had assessed that this results in Australia over-
estimating its catch by 2-4%.  Australia thought that a selectivity study could be an 
interesting exercise but it was looking at different methods for estimating the size of 
its fish such as the stereo video technique. 
49. Japan asked if Australia eventually intended to estimate the bias in the 40 fish 
sample by using the stereo video system in parallel with 40 fish samples.  Australia 
responded that at this point it was only looking at determining the feasibility of the 
stereo video. 
50. Japan remarked that the Extended Scientific Committee adds 20% to the weight of 
the surface fishery declared by Australia when conducting its assessment because of 
a lack of confidence in the accuracy of purse seine catch information.  Australia 
responded that this was not an accurate statement and that the Stock Assessment 
Group (SAG) has looked at a range of scenarios from 0% to 20% for the surface 
fishery and from 0% to more than 100% for the longline fishery.  Australia further 
noted that the 20% came from comparing the 40 fish sample with commercial in 
confidence packing list data from the industry.  Packing lists are from fresh fish sales, 
which are fish that are selected for their large size and fatness, which are not 
necessarily part of the bulk harvest of fish.  Therefore, the packing list information 
contains a biased sample of large SBT and it is not appropriate to compare this with 
the 40 fish sample.  Advice has been received from Professor Trevor Hastie, Head of 
the Department of Statistics at Stanford University who stated, “I have no faith in the 
results reported, because I do not have faith in most of the building blocks.  Even if I 
did, the results are estimates of bias and without standard evidence errors are 
useless”.  The Chair of the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) clarified that SAG 
7 in 2006 examined five scenarios based on the four cases in Attachment 7 (Report 
of the Special Meeting of the Commission) in runs conducted prior to the SAG 
9 
meeting. In order to reduce the number of scenarios to a manageable number, and in 
the absence of information on the relative plausibility of different scenarios of 
surface catch, the SAG decided that a reasonable approach would be to shift 
numbers at age for one of the five scenarios, effectively creating a sixth scenario. 
The SAG agreed that this new scenario would involve a 20% increase in weight but 
not the numbers of fish caught. 
51. Japan expressed its concern about the possible discrepancy among reported catch 
mortality (86), observed catch mortality (22) and observer coverage (13%) in the 
2003/04 fishing season, and Japan asked Australia to provide an analysis of reported 
catch mortalities in the surface fishery against observed mortalities for presentation 
to the next meeting of the ESC.  Australia agreed to provide this analysis and noted 
that based on data collected over several years mortalities are higher on unobserved 
tows than on observed tows. 
52. Australia requested that Japan provide an analysis of fish killed but not landed for its 
SBT longline fishery, particularly with respect to shark damage and other discards.  
This issue was discussed in detail in the Compliance Committee where information 
was provided from a Japanese study on depredation on longline caught tuna which 
showed significant rates of depredation. 
53. Japan noted that Australia reported recreational catches in its national report and 
asked why recreational catches are not deducted from Australia’s national SBT quota.  
Japan further noted that New Zealand allocate 4t of its national quota to recreational 
fishing and believed that Australia should also manage its recreational fishing under 
its national quota.  Australia advised that the recreational catches reported in the 
Australian report include release of live SBT by game fishing clubs.  While Australia 
has some information on the recreational catch, it has very little information 
concerning the rate of release versus kill in this fishery.  Australia is investigating 
this further and it needs to take this step before it can indicate how it impacts on its 
total SBT catch.  Australia commented that even with the inclusion of the estimated 
recreational catch over the last 10 years, on average Australia would be catching less 
than its national allocation. 
 
6.2 Non-Member reports 
54. It was noted that reports had not been received from Cooperating Non-Members 
(CNM) and that one of the CNMs (the European Community) was not present at the 
meeting.  In previous years, CNMs have been asked to provide a report to the 
Extended Commission.  In the absence of written reports, CNMs were asked to 
provide brief verbal reports of their catch to this meeting. 
55. The Philippines confirmed that its catch for 2006 was 43.424t (it had a 45t quota 
allocation) in accordance with its letter to the Extended Commission dated 25 June 
2007,  concerning revision of its report in which it used processed weights 
(gilled/gutted weight) instead of whole weights.    The Philippines also advised (in 
that letter) that the catch of one of its vessels was 1,592kg, not the 2,000kg that had 
been previously reported. 
10 
56.  As submitted previously, South Africa initially had a longline fishery in the 1960s. 
This fishery terminated in the late 1960s due to poor catch rates and low value of the 
product. The tuna fishery in South Africa’s coastal waters since then was dominated 
by vessels from Chinese-Taipei and Japan. These bilateral agreements were only 
terminated in 2002. Catches made by these vessels accrued to the Flag State. South 
Africa redeveloped its longline fishery in 1997 as an experimental fishery. This 
fishery was only formalised into a commercial fishery in 2005. Southern bluefin tuna 
are mainly caught as a by-catch to swordfish, bigeye and yellowfin targeting.   
Consequently, southern bluefin tuna catches were small, and were as follows: 
1997 – 0 t (live weight) 
1998 – 1.0t 
1999 – 0.5t 
2000 – 3.7t 
2001 – 0.5t 
2002 – 17.8t 
2003 – 14.7t 
2004 – 19.0t 
57. South Africa is willing to provide information on its southern bluefin tuna catches as 
requested by the Commission. However, further clarification is required on the 
“outstanding data” referred to by the Commission, as well as the format of the data. 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Compliance 
7.1 Report from the Compliance Committee 
58. The Chair of the Compliance Committee presented the reports of the Compliance 
Committee meetings held during 2007.  He noted that he would prefer to have been 
able to report that more progress had been made. 
59. The Second Meeting of the Compliance Committee (CC2) was held on 14 and 15 
October, immediately before CCSBT 14 and a meeting of the Compliance 
Committee Working Group (CCWG) was held in April 2007. 
60. CCSBT 13 had adopted 3 resolutions on: 
• a Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS); 
• a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS); and 
• regulation of transhipments by large scale fishing vessels. 
61. The CCWG had wide ranging discussion and undertook considerable drafting work 
aimed at reaching agreement on the implementation of important Monitoring, 
Control and Surveillance measures.  The meeting came very close to reaching 
agreement on a draft VMS resolution, and reached agreement on further work to be 
undertaken.   
62. The CC2 meeting included some discussions on the business of the Committee’s 
Terms of Reference.  Members had a focus on continued discussions on the 
11 
development and implementation of integrated MCS measures, picking up on the 
work of the First Meeting of the Compliance Committee and the CCWG meeting. 
63. The CC2 reached agreement on the draft resolution on establishment of the CCSBT 
VMS, which it recommended to the Extended Commission for adoption, this is 
provided in Attachment 4 of the CC2 report. 
64. The report of the CC2 meeting provides an illustration of some of the extensive 
discussions on other MCS measures.  
65. In respect of the proposal to implement a Catch Documentation Scheme, very little 
progress was made.  Lengthy discussion was held on this measure at the CCWG 
meeting including drafting and redrafting of resolutions.  Subsequent to that meeting, 
Australia and Japan undertook further intersessional work on this matter.  In addition, 
an informal meeting was held in Tokyo in September, attended by Japan, Australia 
and New Zealand Compliance Committee Members and representatives of Korea 
and Taiwan from Tokyo.  Despite these efforts, and discussion at CC2, we were 
unable to reach agreement on this measure.  Paragraph 39 of the CC2 report records 
some of the areas of disagreement.  Paragraph 40 reports on the intentions of 
Australia and Japan to unilaterally implement their respective CDS proposals on a 
trial basis.  In addition, New Zealand has undertaken to conduct further work on 
finding an acceptable compromise proposal for a CDS. 
66. A summary of discussion on the adopted resolution on Establishing a Program for 
Transhipment by Large Scale Fishing Vessels, is provided in paragraph 50 of the 
CC2 report. 
67. Two draft resolutions relating to SBT farm compliance tabled by Japan are under 
active consideration by Australia. 
68. The CC2 meeting had limited time to discuss other MCS measures and only the 
issue of Port State Measures was discussed.  New Zealand presented a paper on this 
topic and offered, in consultation with other Members, to develop a draft resolution 
for CCSBT15.  There was no consensus on the New Zealand proposal.  There was 
also no time available to consider agenda items relating to the future work program, 
other business and recommendations to the Extended Commission. 
69. With respect to the timing of the next Compliance Committee meeting, Members 
recognised that the Committee requires two days of meeting to meet its obligations 
in respect of regular reporting and assessment of compliance.  In line with the Terms 
of Reference for the Compliance Committee, the Committee will meet immediately 
prior to the annual meeting of the Extended Commission, unless otherwise decided 
by the Extended Commission.  Some Members believed that the Committee needs 
additional meeting time in the foreseeable future and suggested a five day meeting.  
However, no consensus was reached on this point.  The Chair of the Compliance 
Committee noted, however, that Members are committed to continuing discussion on 
MCS measures during the course of this meeting and intersessionally. 
70. The Extended Commission adopted the CC2 report excluding the VMS resolution.

7.2 Integrated Monitoring, Control and Surveillance System 
7.2.1 Catch Documentation Scheme 
71. New Zealand advised that it is working in cooperation with the other Members to 
amalgamate the CDS proposals from Australia and Japan in order to obtain a suitable 
proposal that would be agreeable to all the Members.  As an interim step towards 
developing a CDS, New Zealand proposed the Members adopt amendments to 
enhance the Trade Information Scheme so as to apply to domestic landings.  Some 
Members required time to consider the proposal.  New Zealand circulated a tracked 
changes version of their amendments for Members consideration. 
72. Australia advised in the absence of a comprehensive and agreed CDS that it intended 
to unilaterally implement its own system.  Australia will be seeking to include 
tagging of individual fish with a machine readable system and it will use this to look 
at practical issues with verification of paper trails and other problems and will report 
the results of implementation to the Commission.  Australia would be happy if other 
Members wished to participate in a trial of its system.  Australia also hoped that the 
CCSBT would implement a CDS agreed by all Members.  Australia was confident 
that its system would enable it to provide any data required. 
73. Japan expressed its appreciation and respect for New Zealand’s intent to develop an 
amalgamated CDS proposal.  Japan noted that Japan has implemented its own 
tagging system from April 2006. While waiting for the outcomes of New Zealand’s 
efforts, Japan advised that it will continue to use its current tagging system and at the 
same time Japan will conduct trials based on Japan’s current CDS proposal.  Japan 
will report the outcomes of the trials to the Extended Commission. 
74. New Zealand commented that it would support any steps that would lead to a full 
CDS implementation and New Zealand would be happy to look at implementing 
tagging frameworks.  New Zealand preferred to work with a tagging system agreed 
by the CCSBT but it also supported Australia’s intention in relation to implementing 
a tagging system. 
75. Taking account of the advice of Australia and Japan that they would be 
implementing their own SBT CDS on a trial basis as interim steps towards 
development of a comprehensive CCSBT CDS that includes tagging, and the fact 
that Japan has already implemented a tagging system for SBT, the Members agreed 
that it would be useful if all Members and Cooperating Non-Members endeavour to 
trial SBT tagging programmes, whether individually or in cooperation with one 
another.  It was further agreed that Members and Cooperating Non-Members should 
report back to the Compliance Committee in 2008 on the experience of their trial 
tagging programmes, including by providing information such as the numbers of 
tags used, their distribution, and how the tag information contributed to the 
documentation of the catch and trade of SBT.  The Compliance Committee should, 
at its 2008 meeting, review this information to identify strengths, weaknesses, cost 
effectiveness, practicability and areas for improvement, and report to the Extended 
Commission at its 2008 meeting. 
13 
76. New Zealand proposed that in conducting these tagging trials Members and 
Cooperating Non-Members should to the extent possible follow a common set of 
guidelines.  For this purpose, New Zealand prepared a set of guidelines (Attachment 
9) 
 
7.2.2 Vessel monitoring system 
77. Japan advised that adoption of the VMS resolution related to the confidential matters 
discussed at Agenda Item 3 and that adoption of the VMS resolution also required 
that issue to be resolved.  Japan provided a modification to the VMS resolution, 
which is at Attachment 10. 
78. Subsequent to further discussions, New Zealand advised that agreement was not 
reached on the text of the VMS resolution because of issues related to confidentiality.  
New Zealand expressed its concern that a proposed amendment by Japan to the 
agreed VMS resolution text would have created a precedent whereby individual 
measures were being held hostage to unrelated matters. 
79. In response to a question from Australia as to what were the circumstances behind 
this lack of agreement, New Zealand stated that Japan had requested to make a 
modification to the annex to the VMS resolution that had been concluded at CC2; 
that Japan subsequently proposed a change to the annex that, with a further minor 
change to address concerns raised by other Members, was acceptable to the 
Members; but that Japan had also proposed a change to the substantive text of the 
resolution itself, by proposing a clause that linked continuation of the VMS 
resolution beyond 2008 to broader issues concerning confidentiality not directly 
relevant to the VMS resolution.  Members could not agree on this latter aspect. 
80. Australia noted that it was prepared to agree to accept the resolution in the form that 
it had been agreed to at the Compliance Committee.  It was disappointed that after 
the considerable time and effort that had been expended to achieve consensus at the 
Compliance Committee Members were now not able to reach agreement. 
 
7.2.3 Regulation of transhipment  
81. Japan noted that when the transhipment resolution was adopted at CCSBT 13, it 
believed that a mistake was made in relation to the implementation date of the 
resolution.  The CCSBT transhipment resolution was based on IOTC’s resolution, 
but instead of using IOTC’s implementation date of 1 January 2009, a date of 1 
January 2008 was recorded by mistake.  Japan believed that it was not possible to 
implement the resolution this early (and before the IOTC), particularly when IOTC 
have had several more years of discussion of this issue than the CCSBT. 
82. Taiwan supported Japan’s comments.  It noted that ICCAT has a similar program 
and referred to paragraph 48 of the CC2 report which described issues that CCSBT 
needed to consider in light of the ICCAT experience.  Taiwan supported the CCSBT 
transhipment resolution, but considered that adequate time was required for 
14 
implementation and that it would be very difficult to implement a CCSBT 
transhipment resolution before the IOTC implemented its resolution. 
83. Korea was of the same opinion as Japan and Taiwan.  Korea noted that ICCAT 
commenced consideration of this issue in 2003 and that it took many years to put 
ICCAT’s transhipment measure in place.  Korea also advised that it is not practical 
for CCSBT to have a separate Regional Observer Program (ROP) because the 
catches of Japan, Korea and Taiwan occur in both the ICCAT and IOTC convention 
areas.  Therefore the CCSBT should cooperate with ICCAT and IOTC in 
implementing a transhipment resolution and a ROP.  At CC2, Korea had proposed to 
change the implementation date of the CCSBT transhipment resolution to 1 January 
2009. 
84. New Zealand advised that it had major interest in the transhipment resolution 
because transhipment was recognised as a major loophole for IUU fishing.  In 
addition New Zealand noted that it was also a longlining nation.  New Zealand also 
noted that it was an advocate for harmonisation and for seeking cost effective 
measures, but this did not mean that New Zealand agrees to adjust measures to the 
weakest link. 
85. New Zealand noted that references to a mistake in the text of the transhipment 
resolution recalls discussion noted in the CC2 report on whether it was intended that 
recreational catch should be included in a CDS for SBT. 
 
7.2.4 Independent observer program 
86. Australia noted that although an Independent Observer Program (IOP) was not 
discussed at CC2, this is a very important issue.  Australia believed that agreed IOP 
standards across RFMOs were required.  It further considered that this issue would 
benefit from harmonisation as discussed at Joint Meeting of Tuna RFMOs in Kobe 
in January 2007.  Australia commented that the IOP needs to be developed as soon 
as possible with standards for observing bycatch (particularly sharks, seabirds and 
turtles) and further recognised the value of an IOP as it will also apply to 
transhipment vessels in the near future. 
 
7.2.5 Port State measures 
87. Japan commented that when CCSBT considers developing and implementing Port 
State measures, CCSBT needs to seek the cooperation of South Africa and Indonesia.  
In particular, Japan believed that South Africa was already implementing Port State 
measures in other fishery areas.   
88. South Africa  advised that : 
• Towards the end of last year it developed additional capacity in Fisheries 
Resource Management. One of the key improvements has been the development 
of a specialist unit (Offshore and High Seas Fisheries Management - OHSFM) 
that deals with implementing RFMO management and conservation measures for 
its domestic and foreign fleets. The development of this capacity is essential when 
15 
considering that approximately 1,000 port calls are made a year by foreign fishing 
vessels. South Africa is committed to combating IUU fishing activities by not 
allowing port access to any IUU-listed vessels.  Moreover, unauthorized foreign 
fishing vessels, fishing for regulated species, are not allowed to enter South 
Africa’s ports, but if they do enter, then they are not allowed to discharge their 
catch. Information on the activities of IUU and unauthorized vessels are provided 
to the relevant RFMOs (including CCSBT, ICCAT, IOTC, SEAFO and 
CCAMLR) and in some cases to the Flag State Fisheries Authority.  South Africa 
prohibits any transhipments at sea and only allows transhipment in port on the 
authority of a permit. South Africa has increased the number of random 
inspections carried out on board foreign fishing vessels in ports and it is now 
compulsory for all inspections to be reported on. There has also been an increase 
in the monitoring of vessel discharges. 
• A new database system has also been developed which would allow for the 
efficient reporting of all foreign fishing vessels entering South Africa’s EEZ. The 
report will contain information such as vessel particulars, catch by species and 
area fished. South Africa does not accept miscellaneous fish in the cargo 
declarations received from foreign vessel ships agents. The OHSFM has also 
engaged regularly with the foreign vessel ships agents to educate them on the 
State’s responsibilities to various RFMOs and how IUU fishing undermines 
management and conservation measures. The South African Fisheries Authority is 
also strengthening working relationships with its Ports Authority, Navy, National 
Intelligence Agency and Customs to combat IUU.  Lastly, all tuna and swordfish 
longline vessels fishing for South Africa are required to have a VMS on board and 
are required to carry observers (100% for foreign-flagged vessels under joint 
venture and approx. 20% for domestic vessels). All discharges and transhipments 
from these vessels are monitored by a Fishery Control Officer or Monitor. 
 
7.2.6 Other MCS measures from CCSBT13 
89. The Chair of the Compliance Committee noted that the CC2 meeting ran out of time 
to get to this item.  One of the important issues not covered was the future work 
program of the Compliance Committee and he hoped that Members might be able to 
give this consideration during the meeting of the Extended Commission. 
 
7.2.7 Compliance measures for SBT farming 
90. There was no further discussion of this item. 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Australian SBT farming study 
91. Australia gave a presentation that described its SBT farming study, including the 
results of its stereo video trials and its plans for further stereo video trials in 2008.  
The presentation included information from Australia’s papers CCSBT-
EC/0710/BDG20 and CCSBT-EC/0710/19.  A similar presentation was also 
16 
provided to SC12 (see paragraphs 35-37 of the SC12 report).  A summary of main 
results from the 2007 trials was: 
• Stereo video measurements were made for more than 85% of the fish transferred. 
• The mean length measured by the stereo video was 1.7% to 2.8% (17.8-27.9mm) 
smaller than the mean direct measurement. 
• Measurements by different observers differed by a maximum of 1%. 
• Hand held stereo video measurement was 9.4% (99.4mm) larger than the true 
measurement. 
92. Australia commented that the main reasons that 15% of the fish were not measured 
was due to: Overlapping of fish, fish entering the camera field at too acute an angle 
and fish moving through the field too quickly. 
93. Australia advised that it sought 10t of Research Mortality Allowance (RMA) to 
cover the 7.5t of mortality that was expected through this work.  The RMA is 
required to ensure that the trials proceed.  Australia noted that the proposed work 
will cost $300,000.  If RMA is not available the cost will increase substantially and 
consequently Australia might not be able to proceed in 2008. 
94. Japan questioned whether Australia had presented all the outstanding issues relating 
to the use of the stereo video or whether there were additional issues such as 
visibility of water, overlapping of SBT, light intensity or resolution of the camera 
that needed further consideration.  Australia advised that there are a number of 
outstanding questions, in particular whether the stereo video can take sufficient 
samples during a full commercial transfer when fish are transferred quickly and with 
overlap.  Adequate light levels and suitable water visibility is required for clear 
images.  Australia advised that until the additional trials are conducted, it cannot be 
sure that the stereo video can adequately replace its existing system. 
95. Japan noted that some of the farms in Mexico had tried stereo video and had found it 
to be impractical.  Japan considered that it was uncertain whether the stereo video 
technique could be improved to an operational level.  Japan also commented that 
significant improvements had been made in acoustic cameras and questioned 
whether Australia had investigated the latest acoustic equipment. 
96. Australia advised that it commenced looking at alternative methods in 2002.  At that 
time it thought that acoustic methods were not suitable for the accuracy required.  
Australia was unable to find any suitable techniques at that time and this is why it 
had been spending time trying to develop the stereo video technique.  Australia also 
noted that stereo video was the main tool for measuring growth of those fish in 
Norwegian salmon farms and the manufacturers of the Norwegian system have 
acknowledged that the Australian stereo video system is better than the system used 
in Norway.  However, Australia advised that if Japan provided information on the 
acoustic system Australia would be happy to consider it again. 
97. In relation to questions regarding the time required for manual measurements of SBT 
with the stereo video system, Australia advised that it could provide information on 
the time required later, but also noted that it would not be necessary to measure all 
SBT to get a good estimate of the weight of the Australia SBT catch. 
17 
98. Japan presented the results of the acoustic camera system experiments for Pacific 
bluefin tuna in Japan (CCSBT-EC/0710/BGD15). Japan stated that the acoustic 
camera is an already established technique that is used for fishery management, such 
as salmon in the North America. Judging from the results of Pacific bluefin tuna 
experiments, it appears to be sufficient ability to be used for size monitoring of SBT 
farming. The acoustic camera has several advantages compared to the stereo video 
system, such as providing subjective length measurement values with enough 
accuracy and automatically in very short time, not affected with light conditions or 
turbidity of sea water, and consist of small scale devices.  Japan recommended that 
the acoustic camera system should be introduced to the farm SBT monitoring. 
99. Discussion following the presentation focused on the accuracy of the technique and 
the degree of validation that had been conducted.  There is an assessment of 
accuracy conducted by the manufacturer and this indicated a +/- 2cm accuracy for 
fish measuring about 2m.  Japan stated that for fish approximately 1m in length, the 
accuracy was thought to be about +/- 1cm. 
100. Japan offered to lend the camera together with their engineers to Australia for testing 
in Australian farms.  Australia thanked Japan for the offer and indicated that it would 
be interested in trialling the camera subject to satisfactory information on the 
accuracy of the camera. 
101. Japan presented CCSBT-EC/0710/BGD16 that described Japan’s observations 
during its visit to Port Lincoln to observe SBT farming operations.  The results of the 
visit revealed the following main issues: 
• From an aerial survey of the farming operations, Japan believed that there were 
more farming pens than advised to the Japanese delegation while at Port Lincoln.  
This was later checked with satellite photographs. 
• While observing fish being transferred from a tow cage into a farming pen a 
number of dead and dying SBT where observed by Japan.  Photographs of some 
of these fish are provided at Attachment 11.  In addition, the average weight of 
the fish in this tow cage (from the 40 fish sample) was reported to be 17.1kg.  
However, an experienced Japanese scientist who was present believed that the 
average weight was in excess of 20kg based on his visual estimate.  
• Japan did not have the opportunity to see the 40 fish sample and requested video 
footage of a complete 40 fish sampling. 
• Local operators (3 people) advised the Japanese delegation that growth rates in 
the farms were a magnitude between 1.5 and 1.7, which is less than doubling in 
growth often stated by Australia.  Japan also commented that it had received 
information that local sardines with a low fat content were recently being fed to 
the SBT. 
102. In relation to these comments, Australia responded that its SBT farms and farming 
are highly scrutinized and monitored by AFMA, the South Australian Government 
and the Australian public.  Furthermore, Australia advised that: 
18 
• In noting Japan’s observation that there were 149 pens at Port Lincoln, Australia 
agreed that there are more than 140 pens in the waters around Port Lincoln. They 
stated that some pens at Port Lincoln are operated by the South Australian 
Government Research Institute (SARDI) which is engaged in aquaculture 
research.  There are pens for different species such as kingfish and there are pens 
that are fallow or are ready in the event of pens needing replacement.  
Furthermore, the South Australian Government’s website provides, amongst other 
details, information on the number of farms and details of ownership and 
environmental monitoring information. 
• In relation to Japan’s observations of dead fish, Australia responded that 
Australia’s farmers wish to reduce mortalities as they are an economic loss. 
Mortalities are recorded and are provided to Members through Australia’s TIS 
reports and in 2005 Australia reported in excess of 12,000 mortalities in farming 
operations.  In addition, Australia believed that Japan was viewing a grow-out pen 
and noted that dead fish in these photographs have already been counted against 
quota. 
• Regarding the visual estimate of weight by the Japanese scientist compared to 
Australia’s direct measurements of weight, Australia stated that visual estimates 
of weight are far less accurate than direct weight measurements. 
• The recent Japanese visit was requested at short notice and the timing was when 
tow cage arrivals are irregular and unpredictable. Unfortunately since the 
Japanese delegation were only in Port Lincoln for about four days, their visit did 
not coincide with the arrival of a tow cage, and they were unwilling to extend 
their stay, hence they were unable to view a 40 fish count.  Australia advised that 
February was the best month for seeing the 40 fish sampling process and extended 
an invitation for CCSBT Members to visit and view a 40 fish sample or any part 
of the monitoring process. 
• In relation to growth rates, Australia noted that the information industry had 
provided was net growth rate, that is it excludes gills and guts and freezer loss and 
represents information from shorter term grow-out.  Further, Australia noted that 
Japan had also spoken to a local scientist who confirmed the doubling in growth.  
Australia cited three papers from the international refereed literature in relation to 
the very rapid growth rates of bluefin tuna. A paper in Aquaculture Research by 
Aguado-Gimenez and Garcia-Garcia (2005) demonstrated that farmed Atlantic 
bluefin tuna nearly doubled in weight (32 to 63kg) in 232 days. A study by Ticina, 
Katavic and Grubisic (2007) published in Aquaculture found that 1 year old 
Atlantic bluefin tuna showed a 134% weight increase in 244 days. They also 
found that the biomass of tagged Atlantic bluefin decreased due to resultant 
starvation and that it took the fish 2 to 3 months to recover to their initial weight. 
Kataviae, Tieina and Franieeviae (2001) reported in the ICCAT Standing 
Committee on Research and Statistics that after 515 days of cage culture Atlantic 
bluefin tuna quadrupled their weight from 9 to 39 kg.    Australia also advised that 
“local sardines” (pilchards) which have high nutrition value is only about 30% of 
the SBT diet in the farms and that there is a complex process for selecting the type 
19 
of feed depending on the stage of the fish in the production cycle and prevailing 
environmental conditions. 
103. Australia also stated that Japan had agreed that its delegates would follow the 
CCSBT Rules of Procedure in relation to the confidentiality of its visit to the 
Australian farms at Port Lincoln.  Nevertheless an article appeared in a Japanese 
newspaper on 11 April 2007 that related details of the visit and made inaccurate 
claims about the farming operations.  Australia advised that it was concerned about 
this breach of confidentiality.  Australia was concerned that one of the photos in 
Japan’s presentation of its visit had appeared in that newspaper article. 
104. Japan presented growth rate results from a recently published study of SBT growth 
in pens at Port Lincoln.  The growth rates in this study from March to July/August 
only resulted in about a 1.5 increase in weight.  Australia responded that the data 
presented demonstrated the impressive growth capacity of SBT.  The data were from 
a research study of different feeding regimes and the fish were tagged, both of which 
are likely to seriously compromise growth rates.  However the study still achieved 
very rapid growth rates.   Previously cited study (Aquaculture Research, Ticina, 
Katavic and Grubisic) indicated that it takes fish 2-3 months to recover their weight 
after tagging. 
105. Australia showed a short video footage of one of its 40 fish samples.  The video 
showed the process of weighing, measuring and tagging the fish after it had been 
caught.  The following comments were made in relation to the footage and the 
process of 40 fish sampling: 
• Japan advised that it had requested to see the entire process from when hook is 
thrown in water to the fish being brought on board and to include the sampling of 
all of the fish in the sample.  This would provide a better idea of the how the hook 
and line are used; the length of time involved and how many small fish are 
excluded from the sample. 
• Australia did not have a video of an entire sample, but committed to producing a 
complete video of a 40 fish sample that is conducted, during the next season, and 
providing copies of the video to the other Members. Australia noted that it can 
provide Members with its standards for the hooks and lines used as well as 
samples of the gear.  Australia also remarked that it had provided the entire data 
set of the 40 fish samples over a number of years which includes the fish that are 
under 10kg, to the Independent Panel of Australian Farming Operation and on 
other occasions. 
• Japan noted that the artificial sampling rule (fish less than 10 kg being rejected) 
does not result in a true reflection of the size distribution of the fish in the tow 
cage.  Australia noted that the study by Professor O’Neil, head of the Statistics 
Department at the Australian National University, had estimated that excluding 
fish under 10kg results in Australia over-estimating its catch by 2-4% annually. 
• Australia advised that the samples are usually taken just before the tow cage 
enters the Port Lincoln area.  There are a range of sheltered areas that are 
preferred for conducting the sample.  Samples are completed in one day (2-3 
20 
hours), but prevailing weather conditions can occasionally cause a sample to be 
abandoned. 
106. Australia reminded Members that the Independent Review of Australian SBT 
Farming Operations Anomalies (Farm Review) reported that “the regulation of the 
industry is a rigorous and well managed process with no apparent anomalies and no 
scope for over-catch via misreporting”.  Australia recognises that its process is based 
on sampling and in any sampling regime, be it longline caught fish or fish being 
placed into farms, there are estimation errors.  Australia has been doing research at 
its own cost to continue to improve the sampling regime for farmed fish.  This has 
included opening the process to independent review and these reviews have been 
made available to CCSBT.  Australia has been seeking information on similar 
estimation errors that might exist in longline fishing, such as how accurate weights 
are that are taken on the deck of a boat in rolling seas, but to date we have received 
no information.  However, Australia recognises that any estimation errors associated 
with the longline fishery are trivial when compared with the anomalies identified in 
the paper “comparison of CCSBT catch data with Japanese auction sales of frozen 
SBT (CCSBT-EC/0510/25)” based on data provided by the Tokyo Metropolitan 
Government.  Australia continues to question why the catches reported in Japan’s 
national reports can vary so widely from the amount of SBT that is sold in the 
markets in Japan. 
107. Japan advised that the Farm Review also stated that “The Review Panel identified 
two main areas where potential anomalies may occur in estimating SBT catch: loss 
of weight during tow; biases in the 40 fish sample”.  Japan noted that the timetable 
for the Australian SBT Farm study in paragraph 44 of the CCSBT 13 report had not 
been met and hoped that Australia would be able to implement the schedule. 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Recreational fisheries 
108. Japan noted that Japan, Korea and Taiwan do not have any recreational fishing and 
that the CCSBT has not been provided with figures concerning Australia’s 
recreational catch since 2003.  The report of SC12 stated that “To ensure a high 
probability of stock rebuilding, all unreported and under-reported catches must be 
eliminated…” and noting internet articles of recreational SBT being caught in 
Tasmania, Japan asked Australia to work on estimating its recreational catch.  Japan 
recognised the difficulties in managing recreational fisheries, but believed that 
Australia’s recreational catch should be managed and included in its national 
allocation. 
109. Australia referred to table 6 of its national report that showed the level of 
recreational catch for some years prior to 2003.  It was noted that the recreational 
catches are highly variable.  Australia advised it is looking into its recreational catch 
to examine the rate of kill versus the rate of release and will report back to the 
Extended Commission when it has more information.  Australia also commented that 
there have been many years in which the Australian catch has fallen short of its 
21 
national allocation and that its recreational catch would easily be accommodated by 
such shortfalls in catch. 
110. Japan commented that regardless of the amount, it is the responsibility of managers 
to manage all types of fisheries and Japan looked forward to seeing a report on 
Australia’s new recreational catch information and Australia’s new way of managing 
its recreational fishery. 
111. Australia noted that recreational fisheries in Australia are managed by the States not 
the Commonwealth and this involves coordination between the State and 
Commonwealth agencies. 
112. The Chair noted that the Extended Commission anticipated a report from Australia 
to the Extended Commission on the management of its recreational fishery. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
Report from the Chair of the Extended Scientific Committee 
113. The ESC Chair presented document CCSBT-EC/0710/32. The Chair highlighted the 
following issues discussed at Twelfth Meeting of the Scientific Committee: 
• Reported global catches 
• Review of fisheries indicators- recruitment, spawning biomass, and exploitable 
biomass 
• Assessment of stock status 
• Management advice 
• Management procedure implications 
• Review of the SRP 
• 2008 Workplan  
114. No new model based assessment was conducted in 2007. However, fishery 
indicators were reviewed in 2007. The EC endorsed the following conclusions 
regarding stock status from the ESC based on the 2006 scenario results and the 2007 
review of indicators: 
• There was no appreciable sign of change in stock status since 2006; 
• Recruitments from the last decade are estimated to be well below the levels in the 
period 1950 – 1980; 
• Analysis of the available information from the indicators and the scenarios 
indicate low recruitment in 2000 and 2001 and probably also in 2002 and 2003; 
• Results of the scenario evaluations in 2006 are generally consistent with the 2005 
assessment, and indicate the SBT spawning biomass is at a low fraction of its 
original biomass, well below the 1980 level, and below the level that could 
produce MSY; and 
22 
• Rebuilding spawning biomass would almost certainly increase sustainable yield 
and provide security against unforeseen environmental effects. 
115. The Extended Commission endorsed the management recommendations made by the 
ESC (SC12 report, paragraph 69)in 2007, summaries of which are as follows: 
• Accurate catch and effort data are critical to any stock assessment or management 
procedure and there needs to be assurance that future data are accurate. Therefore, 
further work is required to reduce the uncertainty about historical catches and 
CPUE. 
• The indicator analysis did not provide any appreciable signs of change in stock 
status and hence there is no need to revise the management recommendations on 
catch levels from 2006. 
• Because the TAC has been set for 2007 – 2009 and no changes are anticipated 
until 2009, the SAG will need to consider new available information in 2009 and 
use scenario modeling to evaluate the impact of different future catch levels on 
stock status. 
• A management procedure needs to be adopted as a basis to provide management 
advice in 2011 or 2012. 
• Previous management procedure development assumed that the sole indicator 
used for input was LL 1 CPUE and its age structure. There is now agreement that 
future management procedures should be based on inputs from a broader range of 
indicators. 
Discussion of the Report of the Extended Scientific Committee 
116. New Zealand noted that the SAG/ESC will continue to undertake annual indicator 
analyses and report the results to the Extended Commission. 
117. Australia remarked that in the absence of reliable data, the indicators have become 
more important.  Australia then asked if any of those should be emphasised or were 
they given equal importance by the ESC. The ESC Chair replied that Attachment 9 
of the ESC report covers the priority of the indicators. The priorities were grouped 
into 4 categories (H, M, L and essential).  Characterisation of catch (quantity and 
size) and the development of future CPUE indices were regarded as essential.  The 
ESC did not discuss in detail the relative priorities of the other indicators. 
118. Australia asked about the timeframe for future management procedure development. 
The ESC Chair replied that if required a preliminary management procedure could 
be developed for 2009 but the ESC preference would be to develop a more complete 
management procedure for 2011. 
119. Australia enquired whether the practical issues of a management procedure had been 
identified.  The ESC Chair responded that key issues still relate to historical CPUE, 
so the report from the proposed intersessional work and possible CPUE modeling 
workshop will provide a key input to the future development of a management 
procedure.  Given the improvements to data collection that were implemented in 
2006 it may be that a future management procedure may only be based on data from 
2006 onwards.  A future management procedure may also be based on fishery 
23 
independent data, but the ESC will evaluate the results of the CPUE work before 
having a full discussion on that issue. 
120. Japan noted that LL1 CPUE has been a major input to the stock assessment model 
and management procedure.  However, the management of the Japanese longline 
fishery was changed after April 2006, and this will have a substantial impact on the 
way that the Japanese fleet operates.  Japan asked the ESC Chair’s view on the 
impacts of these changes on the consistency or lack thereof between the 2 CPUE 
series. The ESC Chair responded that this issue is potentially very difficult to resolve.  
However, this issue has been successfully dealt with in some fisheries, and this 
would need to be explored for SBT. 
121. Japan commented that there are other CPUE series from Korea, Taiwan, and New 
Zealand and hoped that these will be evaluated.  The ESC noted that a future 
management procedure should include various other fishery indicators.  Japan asked 
which other indicators are under consideration. The ESC Chair responded that 
alternative indicators for use in management procedure development will be 
evaluated at the SAG/ESC meetings in 2008.   
122. Japan stated that a number of indicators have been investigated in the past – longline 
CPUE, aerial surveys, acoustic surveys, Indonesian spawning ground survey, etc. 
Further, Japan stated that all of these indices other than Japanese longline CPUE 
have their problems and faults. Japan asked the ESC Chair what his views were on 
the possible future use of these various indices. The ESC Chair responded that in 
regard to CPUE, Attachment 4 of the SAG report (extract from CPUE workshop) 
outlines progress on each of its terms of reference.  It made specific 
recommendations on how to deal with the past data and, by extension, future data.  
The intersessional work in 2007/08 will be investigating a number of the issues of 
past and future data after the change in the Japanese management system.  There also 
needs to be a close look at all the available recruitment indices to evaluate if they can 
be used as fishery independent indices.  The future use of the Indonesian spawning 
biomass index also needs to be examined by the scientists who are closer to the data. 
123. Japan stated that the current assessment of SBT relies heavily on Japanese CPUE 
and therefore CCSBT has to change the way it conducts future assessment of the 
stock because about half of the TAC set by the CCSBT is caught by Australian 
surface fisheries for farming. The ESC Chair replied that Japan’s understanding is 
largely correct.  There was a large emphasis at the ESC in reducing the uncertainties 
in the past CPUE and this is being addressed intersessionally and the outcomes of 
this work will be important to future assessment and management procedure 
development.  The new tagging methods can potentially result in estimates of 
absolute biomass.  Given the efforts that are being made to address the catch 
anomalies and the new tagging methods under development, the ESC Chair 
commented that there is a strong possibility of developing a management procedure 
in the future. 
124. Japan noted that in relation to the 2007 management recommendations, the ESC 
stated that further work is needed to reduce uncertainty about historical catches and 
CPUE.  Japan stated that the ESC report also refers to the potential bias in the 40 fish 
24 
sampling of the Australian farming operation and the size composition and mean 
weight from this sampling will need to be revised to reduce any uncertainty of both 
historical and future catch levels.  Japan asked what the ESC Chair’s view is on this 
matter. The ESC Chair stated that the view of the ESC was that provision of accurate 
catch and effort data in the future was critical to stock assessment and management 
procedure development. 
125. Japan referred to the Table in Attachment 5 of the ESC 12 report.  Japan indicated 
that the table should not be made public according to rule 10 of the CCSBT Rules of 
Procedure.  
126. The ESC Chair indicated that the issue of confidentiality was not brought up by any 
Member during ESC meeting.   
127. The following discussion on Attachment 5 of the SC 12 report centered on the 
components of the column headed “Retrospective IUU catch estimate scenario”. The 
column is made up of estimates from one of the Japanese market anomaly scenarios 
and one of the Australian SBT farm anomaly scenarios. Japan requested that 
Attachment 5 of the ESC 12 report not be made public under Rule of Procedure 
10(5).  New Zealand stated that this action sets a precedent.  While New Zealand 
fully respects the Commission’s confidentiality arrangements, they fully endorse the 
past practice of releasing Commission reports in their entirety. Australia stated for 
the record that the global SBT catch by flag state data should be part of the public 
record. 
128. Japan stated for clarification that the SC 12 report can be released but Attachment 5 
should be deleted from the released version. There would be another version 
containing Attachment 5 for use by the Commission. The Extended Commission 
agreed that the data in Attachment 5 can be used in the stock assessment and 
management procedure development process by the SAG and ESC. Furthermore, the 
country reported catches are not restricted and can be made public. 
129. Australia requested that the retrospective IUU scenario should be separated into LL 
fishery and surface fishery.  Japan indicated that this task was not necessary at this 
point, but suggested that this request should be made from Australia to the ESC. 
Australia requested that the column labelled retrospective IUU should be split into 
four columns (1) IUU for longline (2) bias for longline (3) IUU for surface fishery, 
(4) bias for surface fishery.  Australia further clarified that the various scenarios for 
the surface fishery dealt with possible bias and estimates of catches, whereas no bias 
had been identified in the longline fishery and it was unclear how much of the 
estimates of catch was due to IUU fishing and how much was associated with biased 
sampling.  Japan requested that in the future, this table should also include a column 
of recreational catches by Australia.  
130. The Extended Commission endorsed the recommendation from the ESC that the 
2008 SAG and ESC meetings would be devoted almost entirely to a management 
procedure workshop with a review of the fisheries indicators as well. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
25 
131. The meeting noted that CCSBT 13 set the TAC of Members for 2007 to 2009 for 
most Members and 2007 to 2011 in the case of Japan and that this was only to be 
reviewed if exceptional circumstances emerged in relation to the stock.  The meeting 
also noted that the report from the Extended Scientific Committee did not show any 
indication of a change in the status of the stock since 2006 and that the TAC set by 
CCSBT 13 was in the range recommended by the Extended Scientific Committee.  
Consequently, the Extended Commission reconfirmed its decision on the TAC and 
its allocation as specified in paragraphs 60 to 69 of the CCSBT 13 report. 
132. The Extended Commission also agreed to maintain the interim catch allocations for 
2008 for Cooperating Non Members to the levels specified at paragraph 64 of the 
CCSBT 13 report. 
133. New Zealand presented its paper (CCSBT-EC/0710/30) on a proposal for over and 
under fishing for southern bluefin tuna. 
134. Korea fully supported New Zealand’s proposal. 
135. Australia supported the principle of an over and under regime for national 
allocations, but also believed this must be supported by MCS to monitor the catch.  
Australia had some concerns about the permissible level of over catch currently in 
the proposal.  Australia recognised that it is difficult to achieve a single level as there 
is a wide range of allocations between Members, for example, Australia would be 
permitted to have a 526.5t over catch without penalty (except for payback) and 
Australia considered this to be too high, whereas the European Community 
permissible overcatch would only be a few fish.  Australia thought that a sliding 
scale was a good idea to deal with this issue and that the proposal required 
refinement of the numbers to ensure there is no economic incentive to over catch. 
136. Japan wished to consider the detail of the proposal further.  A concern of Japan’s 
was allowing the carry forward of under catch considering the current low level of 
the SBT stock.  Japan also noted that some other RFMOs, such as ICCAT, have over 
catch provisions with rules and penalty provisions in relation to pay back of over 
catch. 
137. Taiwan supported New Zealand’s proposal and noted that the carry-over level and 
over catch penalty should be subject to further negotiation among Members. 
138. The Chair noted that there was strong support for New Zealand’s proposal and 
invited New Zealand to discuss the detail further with Members.   
139. The Extended Commission gave further consideration to an under and overfishing 
proposal developed by New Zealand (CCSBT-EC/0710/30). The proposal was 
further developed in the margins of the meeting. No consensus position was 
developed on the original form of overfishing provisions proposed by New Zealand 
so as an interim solution (pending the development of a system specifically for 
CCSBT based around the original New Zealand proposal) the ICCAT overfishing 
provisions were included within the New Zealand proposal for consideration. While 
some Members agreed that such a proposal could be adopted others asked for 
examples of how this measure was implemented in the ICCAT area because it 
26 
appeared to present implementation problems.  In light of those implementation 
problems the resolution could not be agreed.  
140. The New Zealand proposal remains a work in progress and is attached as 
Attachment 12. This proposal will be further developed intersessionally by New 
Zealand for further consideration by Members of the Extended Commission. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Report from the joint tuna RFMO meetings 
141. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/0710/08 concerning the joint 
meeting of tuna RFMOs.  The meeting developed three draft courses of action: 
• Key areas and challenges; 
• Technical work to cooperate across RFMOs to address the challenges; and  
• Follow-up actions. 
142. A Technical Working Group Meeting was then held in Raleigh, USA in July 2007 
which considered trade and catch documentation schemes. 
143. Five recommendations were made by the Executive Secretary in paper CCSBT-
EC/0710/08.  The meeting endorsed those recommendations, noting that the “Course 
of Actions” had been endorsed and not just endorsed in principle. 
144. In addition to the items noted in paper CCSBT-EC/0710/08, it was noted that other 
important outcomes from the Kobe meeting were in relation to performance reviews 
of the tuna RFMOs and harmonisation of measures amongst the RFMOs. 
145. Taiwan commented that Taiwan’s tuna fisheries cover three oceans, so for effective 
implementation there is a need for harmonisation with other RFMOs in terms of 
compliance measures.  If different regions adopt different measures, it will be 
difficult for implementation.  Taiwan therefore suggested that any measures adopted 
in CCSBT in the future be consistent with other RFMOs. 
146. New Zealand advised that it was an advocate of harmonisation, but that in New 
Zealand’s view, this did not mean that the weakest system should set the standard. 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
CCSBT performance review 
147. The Chair noted previous discussions on the effectiveness of RFMOs and reviews of 
their performance, noting that a performance review for CCSBT had been agreed at 
CCSBT 13, but not subsequently prioritised (CCSBT-EC/0710/20 refers). The Chair 
further noted developments in 2007, including the outcomes of the Kobe meeting 
(CCSBT-EC/0710/Info 03), and the Chatham House paper on reviewing RFMOs 
(CCSBT-EC/0710/Info 02). 
148. New Zealand summarised its paper (CCSBT-EC/0710/29), and introduced Ingrid 
Jamieson, its nominee for the proposed performance review working group.   
27 
149. Australia noted it had already commented on the importance of performance reviews 
of all RFMOs, particularly CCSBT. Australia was in general agreement with New 
Zealand’s paper, but had some specific comments on the Terms of Reference (TOR). 
In particular, the composition of the panel should be clearly defined. Australia 
suggested the following wording: “The panel shall include one participant from each 
Member, and an independent expert agreed by Members. The panel shall also 
include a participant from the Secretariat.” Australia noted its support for the 
inclusion of an external expert as part of the review panel.   
150. Taiwan thanked New Zealand for its work on the paper. It noted the suggestion to 
include external experts. Taiwan was unsure whether or not this aspect had been 
included in the 2008 budget. However, if it had already been budgeted for, Taiwan 
would support the inclusion of an independent expert. 
151. Japan thanked New Zealand for its efforts, and asked for clarification on the status of 
decisions that were made at CCSBT 13, and how it could be ensured that future 
review work would proceed. Despite agreement at that meeting, no performance 
review had occurred in 2007. The Executive Secretary explained that while names 
had been sought electronically to fulfil the requirements of CCSBT 13, and some 
names had been provided, a working group had not been established and no review 
had occurred. In relation to ensuring future work proceeded, it would depend on 
sufficient energy being put in by all participants.  
152. Korea noted the criteria in New Zealand’s paper for the external expert, and noted its 
view that in addition, the person chosen should have a good working knowledge of 
CCSBT in particular. 
153. Japan expressed concern about the wording of item (ii) of the proposed terms of 
reference in Annex One of the New Zealand paper, in relation to the group making 
recommendations including any necessary changes to the Convention. There was 
some concern that it is Parties to the Convention who should make any necessary 
changes to the Convention. It was clarified that the performance review working 
group would make recommendations, which may include suggestions in relation to 
the Convention text, to the EC, and that Members would subsequently consider the 
recommendations and make decisions as required. New Zealand noted there was no 
specific proposal to alter the Convention, but the wording was included so as not to 
constrain the considerations of the working group. Australia also noted that other 
RFMOs, for example ICCAT, have recognised the need to alter their Convention 
texts to modernise them in line with international best practice. Nonetheless, the 
Chair clarified that Members did not have any specific intention to change the 
Convention at this stage, and it was agreed to delete the phrase “including any 
necessary changes to the Convention” from (ii) of the Terms of Reference in Annex 
One of the New Zealand paper, without limiting the scope of what the performance 
review working group may consider for improving the performance of CCSBT.  
154. Members noted the importance of ensuring the transparency and credibility of the 
performance review, and discussed ways in which independent experts could be 
involved in the review in order to achieve this. The New Zealand paper proposed 
28 
including an independent expert as part of a performance review working group, 
who would work intersessionally and would also have one meeting.  
155. Japan and Taiwan suggested an alternative approach which they considered would 
be more time and cost effective: for Members to conduct self-evaluation based on 
the criteria in Attachment B of the New Zealand paper. Independent experts could 
subsequently review the performance review report.  New Zealand and Australia 
noted this was the approach envisaged at Kobe, which Members had agreed to, and 
in subsequent discussions.   
156. New Zealand noted it preferred to have the independent expert involved in the 
review process from the start.  The reasons for this are to counter difficulties that 
might arise for someone who is independent coming to terms with CCSBT’s 
operation while working in isolation; and to avoid the situation that could arise were 
two conflicting reports to result from the review. 
157. Members agreed to proceed with a performance review for CCSBT in 2008, and 
agreed on the amended Terms of Reference for the performance review working 
group, as contained in Attachment 13.  Members also agreed both the report and the 
expert(s)’ comments on it would be made available on the CCSBT website. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Report from the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
(ERSWG) 
158. On behalf of the Chair of the ERSWG (Dr. Uozumi), Japan briefly introduced the 
outcomes of the Seventh Meeting of the Ecologically Related Species Working 
Group. 
• The meeting was held in Tokyo during July 2007.  All Members of the Extended 
Commission and observers from ACAP and Birdlife International attended the 
meeting. 
• While the meeting reviewed updated information since the sixth meeting of the 
ERSWG in February 2006, such as national reports from Members and new 
information on ERS, the meeting spent the majority of time on discussion on draft 
recommendations concerning: ERS data collection and provision; reducing the 
bycatch of seabirds; and conservation and sustainable utilisation of sharks. 
• Participants to the ERSWG spent a considerable amount of time and effort in 
finalising these draft recommendations.  However, the ERSWG could not reach 
agreement on draft recommendations.  Consequently, the ERSWG decided to 
seek guidance on the following matters from the Extended Commission: 
o Whether or not the CCSBT can make binding resolutions on ERS; 
o Whether the ERSWG should monitor the effect of farming on ERS; and 
o How to proceed with the six draft recommendations (attachment 5 to 10 of the 
ERSWG7 report). 
159. The Chair invited statements from the NGO observers on ERS matters. 
29 
160. WWF and TRAFFIC advised that: 
• They have already stated that they are deeply concerned with the lack of progress 
by CCSBT relating to the management of ecologically related species (ERS) in 
SBT fisheries over the last 12 years. 
• As an absolute minimum, from this meeting WWF and TRAFFIC hope for: 
o Agreement to adopt ERS mitigation measures within 12 months, that are 
already used in other RFMOs & CCAMLR – for example night setting and line 
weighting; and appropriate shark mitigation measures that are detailed in the 
TRAFFIC report – “Confronting Shark Conservation Head On” that has 
previously been supplied to delegates. 
o A process to be put in place within the next twelve months to establish 
consistent data collection and reporting standards for ecologically related 
species in SBT fisheries. 
o The Commission to consider the establishment of an independent review panel 
of nominated ERS ‘experts’ to ensure that these issues receive due 
consideration as an integral part of fishing for SBT. 
• This is in area of performance review where currently the Commission has little 
progress to report, particularly in comparison with other regional fisheries 
management forums.  This meeting would seem an ideal opportunity to layout a 
framework for progressing these major issues. 
161. The Humane Society International (HSI) advised that: 
• HSI came to this meeting with grave concerns over the rate of seabird and shark 
bycatch in the longline fisheries under the purview of the CCSBT. Yet, rather than 
discussing practical measures to deal with these critical problems, we are 
disturbed to find that Members are still arguing over the mandate of the 
Commission to deal with bycatch and arguing over the Terms of Reference for the 
Working Group that was set up to deal with it. 
• Ten thousand albatross are being killed a year by SBT longline fisheries. These 
include species heading for certain extinction unless the impact of longline fishing 
is addressed. 
• Other RFMOs are tackling their bycatch problems, admittedly with differing 
degrees of success. The CCSBT lags far behind all of them. 
• Whatsmore, in reading Member country reports to this meeting, we even note that 
not all Member countries mandate the use of the one mitigation measure the 
CCSBT did manage to agree to a decade ago, describing tori lines as a voluntary 
measure. 
• HSI implores you all to, today, resolve the dispute over the Commission and ERS 
mandates to deal with bycatch and to immediately move on to reaching agreement 
on practical measures to prevent seabird and shark bycatch – adopting those that 
have proven to be effective in other RFMOs. In particular we would commend 
line weighting and night setting as measures that have the greatest potential to 
address seabird bycatch. 
30 
162. The Chair asked Members if they would be willing to seek and abide by professional 
advice regarding the Extended Commission’s mandate to make binding measures on 
ERS matters.  In relation to this: 
• New Zealand responded that the seeking of advice would further delay matters 
and that Members had suitable professional expertise present at this meeting to 
resolve the issue. 
• Australia noted that its interpretation was that that the Extended Commission’s 
mandate can be as broad as the Commissioners wish to make it.  Australia also 
noted the impacts of fishing for SBT involved both the target and bycatch species.   
• Taiwan agreed with Korea’s previous comment.  The issue is not whether the 
measure is binding or not.  The issue is that Australia and Japan have different 
views on the recommended resolutions and Taiwan hopes that both sides can 
reach agreement. 
• Japan advised that its position was clear.  This is that any matter can be discussed, 
but there will only be legally binding measures for SBT and Japan was not 
prepared to accept New Zealand’s position at this time. 
163. Extensive discussion was held in relation to the guidance requested of the Extended 
Commission by ERSWG 7.  The status of these discussion is summarised as follows:   
• Whether the CCSBT can make binding measures for ERS related issues:  This 
was discussed in both plenary and heads of delegation without agreement.  Some 
Members believed CCSBT could adopt binding resolutions, while other Members 
expressed their view that the CCSBT could not adopt binding resolutions.  The 
meeting did not reach consensus. 
• Whether ERSWG should monitor the effects of farming on ERS.  Australia stated 
its view on this, but the meeting could not reach consensus. 
• How to proceed with the 6 draft resolutions from ERSWG 7.  The meeting did not 
have substantial discussion on this issue. 
164. Australia advised that it takes bycatch and interaction with ERS seriously, 
particularly in relation to seabirds, sharks and turtles.  Australia implemented a threat 
abatement plan for seabirds in 1998 with target limits for seabird catches in its 
longline fisheries.  Australia also has a catch limit of 20 sharks per trip in 
Commonwealth fisheries and sharks cannot be finned.  Australia follows FAO 
guidelines for turtles.  Australia believes that the ERSWG is an important and 
essential element of the CCSBT and believed that CCSBT has a mandate to make 
binding resolutions on ERS matters.  Australia noted that seabird mitigation 
measures were particularly relevant to CCSBT due to the distribution of SBT fishing 
in relation to seabird populations.  In addition some species of sharks listed by 
CITES (e.g. Porbeagle) are also distributed within the SBT habitat.  Australia hopes 
that the Commission will agree to allow the ERSWG to continue its work and make 
recommendation to the CCSBT that can become binding resolutions. 
165. Australia advised that: 
31 
• Australia is very concerned that after 12 years, the CCSBT has made little 
progress on ERS issues. Australia considers that not only does the CCSBT have a 
mandate to make binding resolutions on ERS, it also has a responsibility to ensure 
ERS are not adversely impacted by fishing activities. These responsibilities are 
outlined in various international obligations. 
• In relation to farming and ERS, Australia has regularly informed Members that 
SBT farms are subject to strict environmental impact assessment and monitoring 
to comply with domestic regulations.  The information on these assessments and 
monitoring is publicly available on the web 
(www.sardi.gov.au/pages/sbt/public/welcome_sbt.htm:sectID=912&tempID=14) 
and has been provided at the SAG and SC.  Australia is willing to report on the 
results of the environmental monitoring of farming activities and discuss the 
contents at meetings of the ERSWG.  As the farming occurs in State waters this 
will be done in conjunction with the South Australian government who are 
responsible for this monitoring.  In doing this Australia would want to ensure that 
the ERSWG does not develop into a group that discusses farming activities 
exclusively, but has technical discussions based on relative risk to ERS and 
international obligations (such as IPOAs).  Australia also notes that the farms 
contain SBT that have been removed from their normal oceanic ecosystem and 
relocated into the coastal waters of South Australia and hopes that things will not 
progress to the point where there are discussions around SBT held in land-based 
facilities for propagation. 
• Australia will continue to collect data on ERS from all its fishing activities and 
undertake measures to mitigate seabird bycatch and ensure the management of 
shark catches.  This is in line with Australia’s domestic requirements, such as our 
legislative commitment to minimising bycatch and the broader impacts of fishing 
on ecosystems, our Threat Abatement Plan for addressing the impact of longlining 
on seabirds and our NPOA for the Conservation and Management of Sharks. 
• Australia regards the technical advice, such as would be provided by the ERSWG 
in meeting its terms of reference, as important to supporting CCSBT to address 
urgent ERS issues.  The ERSWG should develop a work program on the basis of 
risk to the ERS associated with fishing activities and international obligations. 
166. New Zealand described its views in paper CCSBT-EC/0710/31.  New Zealand was 
disappointed in the outcome of ERSWG7 and that this technical working group 
became involved in a policy debate which hindered its progress on technical matters.  
New Zealand explained that it considers that CCSBT has a mandate and an 
obligation to act, and that recording seabird interactions without taking further steps 
was not acceptable.  New Zealand also considered that referring the problems to 
other RFMOs was also not acceptable.  In relation to harmonisation of measures 
between RFMOs, New Zealand advised that it supported harmonisation but that 
harmonisation should not be driven by the weakest link.  Because of the 
geographical area of the SBT fishery, New Zealand believed that CCSBT has the 
responsibility to take firm and strong action on these issues.  There is also a broader 
issue of the mandate of the ERSWG, which requires consideration by this 
commission.  New Zealand suggested that participants at this meeting form a small 
32 
working group and attempt to resolve some of these issues.  Finally, in addition to 
the request for guidance from the ERSWG, the Extended Commission needs to 
provide firm advice to the ERSWG for its work in the future. 
167. New Zealand advised that: 
• It wishes to express its deepest disappointment with the continued lack of 
progress in this Commission on ERS issues.  It is unacceptable that a RFMO 
managing a fishery which is associated with high levels of bycatch incidence on 
vulnerable ERS remains unable to take decisions on these issues. New Zealand 
notes that all Members but for Japan were in a position to agree to adopt binding 
measures on these issues. New Zealand calls on Japan to revisit its position in this 
regard.  It is further disappointing that we cannot even agree on a process or 
timeframe to resolve these types of issues. 
• New Zealand are also highly disappointed that this important issue, as with other 
issues we have been discussing this week, seems to be being used as a pawn in 
disagreements over other matters being considered by the Commission. The net 
result has been that the work of this Commission has actually been wound 
backwards in the past week, in the sense that hard fought outcomes negotiated 
earlier this year have been undone, such as on VMS. While New Zealand 
appreciates that different points of view are sustainable on these other matters, we 
do not consider it acceptable that the entire agenda of this Commission can be 
hijacked in this fashion. CCSBT are confronted with the image of a dysfunctional 
organisation, an image sustained by the events of years past.  New Zealand 
sincerely hopes that the review process we have set in motion will help us to 
move past this state of affairs.   In the meantime, New Zealand implores Members 
to rediscover the spirit and meaning of compromise, which entails concessions on 
all sides, in order for this Commission to move forward.  
• For now, with the failure of the Commission on the matter, NZ will continue to 
implement ERS measures in relation to our fishing activities, including: 
o Mandatory seabird bycatch mitigation measures (night setting and use of tori 
lines); 
o Collection of data on catches of non-target species; and 
o Ensuring the sustainability of shark harvest, through the use of overall catch 
limits for the main bycatch species 
• New Zealand calls on other Members, in particular those involved in longline 
fishing, to follow suit. 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Scientific Research Program (SRP) 
168. The Chair of the Extended Scientific Committee introduced this item and noted that 
most of the issues were covered in the report of the ESC.  Attachment 9 of the ESC 
report lists components of the future SRP and their relative priorities from 
“Essential” to “Low”.  An immediate recommendation was that the conventional tag 
33 
deployments should not occur in 2007/08 and instead, work should focus on 
developing tagging methods that do not require voluntary reporting. 
 
15.1 Indonesian catch monitoring 
169. Japan advised that from April 2002, cooperation has occurred between the IOTC, 
Japan’s OFCF and Indonesia to conduct catch monitoring at Jakarta and Cilicap. 
This joint program completed its first stage in March 2007 and the second stage of 
the joint program has commenced in April 2007.  From April this year Japan has a 3 
year program and Japan has budgeted over $330,000 per year for this program. 
170. Indonesia noted that the Indonesian catch monitoring was conducted from 2002 to 
2006 in collaboration with the OFCF, IOTC and CSIRO from Australia.  From 2007 
the program is conducted and funded by the Indonesian government and we support 
the monitoring activities by the Japanese government. 
171.  Australia noted that the joint Australian-Indonesian SBT Catch Monitoring 
Programme commenced in 1992 and has been focussed on the main SBT landing 
ports (Benoa, Cilacap, Batere and Seleko).  This monitoring is the only direct source 
of information about trends in the age structure of the SBT spawning stock and has 
shown that landings of adult SBT by Indonesian vessels reached as high as 2,500t in 
1999.  This information is essential to the development of management advice within 
the CCSBT and the CCSBT has endorsed the continuation of this work at several 
past meetings. 
172. For the past 15 years, Australia has supported the Indonesian SBT Catch Monitoring 
Programme without contributions from other Members.  The costs of this 
programme are currently in the order of $150,000 per year.  In addition to this, 
Australia has also supported associated work on otolith analysis and Indonesian 
CPUE.  Australia noted that the IOTC monitoring programme commenced in 2002 is 
not focussed on SBT and hence if the SBT-focussed programme was suspended or 
halted, key information would not be collected.  In recognition of the importance of 
Indonesian SBT catch monitoring, Australia asked that the CCSBT consider funding 
this project in the future. 
 
15.2 Aerial survey 
173. Australia noted that in the ESC priorities, the aerial survey has the highest priority of 
the SRP programs in the recruitment monitoring category.  The aerial surveys have 
been going for a long period and have been refined over the years with sophisticated 
analyses being developed for these data. This project costs $575,000 per year and is 
a critical element to ensure our understanding of SBT stock.  Australia has continued 
to support this program due to its high importance and would appreciate assistance 
from other Members with the cost of this research. 
174. Japan advised that in the early 1990s Australia and Japan created a workshop 
framework for monitoring of recruitment and that the two countries have cooperated 
with each other on that work. 
34 
 
15.3 CCSBT tagging program 
175. The ESC Chair repeated his earlier comment that the ESC recommended not to 
continue deployment of conventional tags in 2007/08, but that monitoring of tag 
returns should continue. 
176. The meeting endorsed this recommendation of the Extended Scientific Committee. 
 
15.4 Outcomes of the 2007 SAG/SC review of the SRP 
177. The ESC Chair advised that the ESC regarded three areas of work as being essential 
and that priorities from high to low had been given for the other areas, and that all 
priorities are listed in Attachment 9 of the ESC report. 
 
15.5 Other research projects 
178. Japan noted that the robustness of Japanese longline CPUE was becoming 
questionable because of the drastic change of the fishing patterns and that in light of 
this, CCSBT needed to look at the methodologies appropriate for SBT stock 
assessment.  Japan suggested that there may need to be an expert meeting on SBT 
stock assessment methodology in the near future. 
179. The ESC Chair commented that a large number of the stock assessment approaches 
will be covered in the management procedure workshop proposed for September 
2008.  He advised that leading stock assessment experts would be at this meeting and 
that consequently; this workshop provided an important and cost effective way to 
look into this issue. 
 
Agenda Item 16. 
Cooperating Non-Members 
180. The Executive Secretary advised that the Philippines and South Africa had been 
fully complying with the conservation and management measures of the CCSBT, but 
that there were serious shortcomings with the level of cooperation from the 
European Community.   
 
16.1 Philippines 
181. The Philippines advised that it has complied with the processes of the CCSBT 
Authorised vessel list, the CCSBT Trade Information Scheme and has satisfied other 
reporting requirements, including participation at annual meetings of the Extended 
Commission.  The Philippines requested continuation of its status as a Cooperating 
Non Member together with it 45t allocation. 
182. The Extended Commission approved the continuation of the Philippines current 
status. 
35 
 
16.2 European Community 
183. The Extended Commission noted that the European Community had not met its 
obligations to the CCSBT.  New Zealand recalled the discussion at CCSBT 13 for 
minimum expectations for Cooperating Non Members and attendance at meetings.  
It was agreed that the Chair would write a stern letter to the European Community 
requesting that it comply with the requirements of the CCSBT and that it participate 
in annual meetings of the Extended Commission.  It was also agreed that the 
European Community would be asked to confirm whether it had caught any SBT 
during 2007. 
 
16.3 South Africa 
184. South Africa advised that its past catch data has been provided to the Executive 
Secretary in fulfilment of the request from the Extended Commission.  South Africa 
has cooperated with the Extended Commission and subject to capacity restraints, 
South Africa will participate wherever possible at future meetings. 
185. The Extended Commission approved the continuation of South Africa’s current 
status. 
 
Agenda Item 17. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
17.1 Indonesia 
186. The Chair noted with pleasure that Indonesia expected to become a full Member of 
the Commission in the near future. 
187. Indonesia noted paper CCSBT-EC/0710/14 from the Secretariat and requested that 
three corrections be recorded for that paper as follows: 
• Paragraph 1 (under the heading “Relationship with Indonesia”) stated that 
Indonesia had declined the invitation to become a Member or Cooperating Non 
Member of the CCSBT.  What happened was that at that stage, Indonesia was not 
ready to be involved in the CCSBT due to internal legal processes. Therefore that 
paragraph should be read as “Indonesia has been invited to become a Member or 
Cooperating Non Member of the CCSBT but was not able to do so”. 
• Paragraph 2 (under the heading “Relationship with Indonesia”) indicated that 
Indonesian fishing vessels have moved on to the high seas.  However, due to 
technological and financial constraints, not all vessels have the capability to 
operate on the high seas. 
• Paragraph 3 (under the heading “Relationship with Indonesia”).  Indonesia 
commenced applying a system of fisheries management control from 2004 by 
introducing catch monitoring program. To improve the system, particularly on 
statistical data collection Indonesia has been collaborating with IOTC/OFCF as 
well as with the Australia government through ACIAR, CSIRO and DAFF. 
36 
17.2 Others 
188. No other non-Members were considered. 
 
17.3 Action Plan 
189. It was agreed that the Action Plan should not be invoked. 
 
Agenda Item 18. 
Activities with other organisations 
18.1 Relationship with CCAMLR 
190. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/0710/12 in regards to the 
relationship with CCAMLR.  The paper provided three options on the way to 
proceed. 
191. Taiwan advised that at the annual meeting in 2005, the Extended Commission agreed 
to have an agreement with CCAMLR that covered SBT fishing in CCAMLR’s 
convention area.  However in 2006, agreement could not be reached within CCSBT 
because the terms required by CCAMLR involved management conditions beyond 
what CCSBT had in place.  Taiwan supported option 3 of the Secretariat’s paper if 
no new systems needed to be adopted by the CCSBT, but Taiwan was not confident 
that CCAMLR could accept that response.  Taiwan also noted that it wanted to 
become a cooperating non member of CCAMLR and hoped that CCSBT Members 
could support Taiwan’s application to CCAMLR. 
192. Japan also hoped to seek compromise with CCAMLR.  Japan felt it could accept 
many of CCAMLR’s requirements, but that there were some detailed areas that it 
could not accept.  Japan also noted that in the 2005/06 season and so far in the 
2007/08 season, that there was no fishing in CCAMLR waters by Japanese SBT 
vessels.  Japan thought that if CCAMLR was aware of the limited nature of SBT 
fishing in CCAMLR’s waters, that CCAMLR might be more comfortable with a 
compromise. 
193. Australia noted that most of the CCSBT Members had agreed to CCAMLR’s 
response because CCAMLR is a consensus Commission and most CCSBT Members 
are also CCAMLR members.  Australia did not wish to dilute the capacity of 
CCAMLR to manage its area by having lower standards for SBT vessels.  Australia 
also recalled that there was a proposal submitted to ERSWG 7, proposing that 
conservation and management measures be deferred to other RFMOs . Australia 
noted that the proposal from Japan on seabirds referred to IATTC, IOTC and 
WCPFC, but not to CCAMLR.  Australia was concerned that this may be because 
Japan might not wish to apply CCAMLR’s requirements when fishing in CCAMLR 
waters. 
194. New Zealand was of the view that all vessels in CCAMLR waters should be bound 
by CCAMLR conservation measures and that option three in the Secretariat paper 
was not acceptable.  New Zealand noted that CCAMLR applies high standards 
37 
because the area is unique and saw no reason to relax those standards for SBT 
fishing. 
195. Japan advised that its SBT longline vessels used tori lines and that when they are in 
the CCAMLR convention area, they only engage in night setting with tori line and 
they do not use plastic packaging bands.  However, Japan does not have 100% 
observer coverage.  Apart from certain fisheries, CCAMLR requires 100% observer 
coverage and this is not physically possible for Japanese tuna longliners at this stage.  
Japan is mindful of the environmental and ecological concerns and it has measures in 
place to address those matters.  Japan requested that its intervention be passed on to 
CCAMLR. 
196. Korea noted that when this was discussed at CCAMLR in 2006, CCAMLR did not 
accept the CCSBT’s position.  Korea believes that nothing has changed in relation to 
this. 
197. The Philippines confirmed that Philippine fishing companies have been advised to 
stay out of CCAMLR area. 
198. The Chair noted that there was not much fishing in CCAMLR waters and questioned 
whether the significant effort required to reach agreement was justified. 
199. Japan explained that this matter contained complicated and yet essential issues.  The 
characteristics of the area is such that against the background of global warming 
there is a large influence which may effect the migration pattern of SBT.  So, it 
might be that fishing vessels need to go further south to catch SBT.  Japan does not 
want to see that happening in the short term, but it is contemplating these matters. 
200. Australia recognised the issues raised by Japan about the effects of global warming 
and that this could result in increases in fishing for SBT in the CCAMLR area.  In 
May 2005 an Australian inspection vessel in the CCAMLR area sighted three 
Japanese SBT longline vessels fishing.  It requested to board and inspect them in line 
with CCAMLR procedures but this was refused.  Australia believes that the 
Commission should agree to clear procedures so that such incidences do not happen 
in the future. 
201. Japan advised that the Japanese tuna longliners refrained from operating in the 
CCAMLR convention area after this incident.  In that time, Japan investigated that 
incident and reported the result of the investigation back to Australia. 
202. That Chair advised that there need to be further intersessional work between the 
Executive Secretary and CCAMLR on this matter and that it would be useful to 
obtain more detail on the reservations that Taiwan, Japan and Korea had on the 
specific items within option 3 
 
18.2 Others 
203. No other organisations were considered. 
 
38 
Agenda Item 19. 
Research Mortality Allowance for 2008 
204. CCSBT-EC/0710/23 outlined the recommendations and discussions from the 
Extended Scientific Commission on Research Mortality Allowances (RMA).  
205. The Extended Commission agreed on the two RMA proposals that were endorsed by 
the Extended Scientific Committee.  The agreed proposals were the Australian 
proposal for a mortality allowance of 5 tonnes to tag 20 adult SBT with pop-up 
satellite archival tags in the Tasman Sea and possibly the Indian Ocean, and the 
Japanese proposal for a mortality allowance of 1 tonnes for the trolling survey and 
acoustic tagging survey in 2007/08.  
206. There was considerable discussion of the Australian request for RMA for use in the 
stereo-video trials to be undertaken as part of the Australian SBT Farming Study 
(AFS).  It was noted that the Extended Scientific Committee did not reach consensus 
on the proposal. 
207. Australia reminded Members that at CCSBT 13 it was recognised that RMA would 
be required to undertake the experiments under the AFS as otherwise the costs of the 
work would be prohibitive.  Australia noted that they have reduced their initial 
request for 15 tonnes down to 10 tonnes while noting that it is only expected that 7.5 
tonnes will be used. 
208. Japan noted that originally Australia requested 15 tonnes for this work and have 
revised this request to 10 tonnes.  At the Extended Scientific Commission Japanese 
scientists could not agree to Australian RMA proposal.  However, Japan noted that 
resolving uncertainty in Australian Farming operations was an important issue to 
Japan and that they have had many interventions on this matter during this meeting.  
Japan was supportive of the AFS experiments to address uncertainties in the farming 
operation. 
209. Japan requested that if the experimental design could be modified to address the 
potential biases (e.g. estimation of growth rates) discussed at CCSBT 13 then Japan 
would be able to accept the 10 tonne RMA proposal.  Further, Japan encouraged 
Australian to consider using acoustic camera technology and offered to provide an 
acoustic camera and an engineer who can operate a camera to assist Australia in this 
regard.   
210. Australia thanked Japan for their kind offer and were pleased to discuss it further.  
Australia reminded Members that Australia funds a range of SBT scientific activities 
including the aerial survey and the Indonesian catch monitoring project in addition to 
the AFS experiments.  Given the limited research funds any modifications to the 
farm experiments could have implications for the funding of the other activities. 
Australia indicated that considerably planning is required for these experiments to 
ensure fish, pontoons, and scientists were available.  It requested that that a decision 
on the RMA proposal be made promptly to allow time for the ordering of new 
stereo-video technology and that would be tested. 
211. Following further discussions, Australia agreed to develop a trial to test the accuracy 
of both stereo and acoustic camera technology.  Japan agreed to the use of 10 tonnes 
39 
of RMA for such a proposal.  The Extended Commission agreed to a 10 tonne 
allowance of RMA for Australia. 
 
Agenda Item 20. 
Program of work for 2008 
212. The meeting adopted the proposed workplan, which is at Attachment 14. 
 
Agenda Item 21. 
Other business 
213. Australia made the following statement: 
• In relation to discussion during the course of the meeting and questions raised by 
Australia on Japan’s national report  we have provided to Members a copy of a 
document that was an Australian authored document submitted to CCSBT 12, 
entitled a “Comparison of CCSBT Catch Data with Japanese Auction Sales of 
Frozen SBT” ( CCSBT-EC/0510/25).   
• This document, which includes an abstract in Japanese, uses publicly available 
market data sourced from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG) website 
and shows that the amount of southern bluefin tuna available on the Japanese 
market greatly exceeds the reported Japanese catch as presented in Japan’s 
national report.  The report suggests that in the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 that the 
amount of SBT available on the Japanese market was of the order of 8,696 – 
11,260 tonnes higher per year than expected based on the reported Japanese catch.  
Australia recognizes that the information contained in the paper is an incomplete 
analysis and does not include all markets where SBT is sold, hence it is likely to 
be an under-estimate of the amount of SBT on the Japanese markets. 
• Based on this publicly available data Australia is concerned about how this 
information reflects on the catches presented in Japan’s national report.  For 2002, 
2003, 2004 Japan’s report of catches in its paper is less than half of the weight of 
SBT identified from the publicly available market data from the TMG. 
• Australia recognizes that CCSBT needs to develop a greater understanding of 
these anomalies and hence we request Japan, as a matter of flag state 
responsibility, investigate these anomalies. The investigation would address a 
range of uncertainties that Australia has identified in relation to the estimates of 
longline catch and this may help to explain, in part, the very large discrepancies 
between reported catch and the weight of SBT in the Japanese markets. Australia 
would like the following issues clarified: 
a. Accuracy of measuring SBT on deck; 
b. Estimate of length change of SBT after mortality; 
c. Weight change during freezing; 
d. Accuracy in reporting discarding and high grading, including on board 
consumption and discarding of whale and shark damaged fish; and 
e. Accuracy of the processed weight to whole weight conversion ratio. 
40 
• Australia recognised that in relation to items (a), (d) and (e): 
o That intra- and inter-seasonal variability will require experiments to take place 
over a number of seasons with appropriate replication. This is likely to take 
place over a minimum three year period. 
o Different fishing practices (such as bait, vessel, setting practices, location and 
date of set) will have an effect on (a), (c) and (d) and this will have a large 
impact on the experimental design and confidence intervals given the number 
of variations that would need to be considered. 
• However, the seasonal results will be reported. 
• Australia also requested Japan to endeavour to complete work on the experimental 
design and experimental work as soon as practicable with an emphasis on 
finalizing (a), (b) and (d) in the first year. The requested schedule for this work is: 
o Japan submits a draft initial experimental design to address the issues raised to 
other CCSBT Members - end November 2007 
o Comments from other CCSBT Members - end December 2007 
o Finalise initial experimental design – mid January 2008 
o Finalise tender for experimental project – end February 2008 
o Implementation of experimental approach – February 2008 
o Submission of initial results to Commission – May 2008 
o Submission of revised experimental design – July 2008 
o Examination of results and revised design by ESC – September 2008 
o Examination of the results by the Extended Commission – October 2008 
o Second year study commences 1 December 2009 
o Annual report prepared each July for consideration by Extended Scientific 
Committee. 
• Recognising that it is extremely important to address discrepancies between the 
catches reported in the Japanese national report and the publicly available data 
from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, we see this investigation as a valuable 
work to fulfilling the objectives of the CCSBT. 
• Australia may request to Japan for Australian experts to attend these trials. 
214. Japan made the following statement: 
• Japan stated that the paper, which Australia has just circulated, was submitted to 
the CCSBT12.  At the CCSBT12, Australia and Japan decided to have 
independent review panels relating to Australian SBT farming operations and 
Japanese SBT market.  These two panels have looked at the past estimates on 
Australian surface catch and amount of SBT distributed in Japanese market, but 
the views on the past estimates are different among panel members; consequently, 
they were not able to come up with consensus on past estimates.  Members of 
these two panels have requested the contents of their reports not be published.  In 
relation to Japanese longline fisheries, Japan has introduced a very strict SBT 
management system since April 2006.  In contrast, as mentioned in the opening 
statement by Japan, there is ongoing problem of accuracy in catch by Australian 
41 
surface fisheries for SBT farming.  Japan asked Australia to rectify its domestic 
managements of surface fisheries and SBT farming operations. 
 
Agenda Item 22. 
Close of meeting 
215. Australia re-iterated that its government was currently in caretaker mode. Australia 
has negotiated in good faith, but agreements wait confirmation from the incoming 
government.   This arrangement also applies to the funding and consequently no 
guarantees can be made concerning Australia’s ability to continue to fund research 
projects such as the Indonesian catch monitoring and the aerial survey. 
 
22.1 Election of Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended Commission of the 15th 
Annual Meeting of the CCSBT 
216. The Chair and Vice-Chair will be nominated by New Zealand and Korea 
respectively. 
217. The Third Meeting of the Compliance Committee will be held in Auckland, New 
Zealand on 12-13 October 2008.  The 15th Annual Meeting of the Commission will 
be held at the same location from 14 to 17 October 2008. 
 
22.2 Confidentiality of Commission documents 
218. The Extended Commission confirmed that reports of the Japanese Market Review 
and the Australian Farm Review produced in 2006 would remain confidential. 
219. The meeting confirmed that any document that referred to information from a 
restricted (confidential) document would itself become restricted from public release 
unless the entity who referred to the restricted document obtained explicit consent 
from the authors of that document. 
220. New Zealand noted that for transparency, it hoped that the reports could be released 
at some stage in the future. 
221. The Extended Commission agreed that, with exception of Attachment 5 of the SC12 
report, the documents and reports of meetings under the jurisdiction of CCSBT 14 
could be made publicly available from noon (Canberra time) on 22 October 2007. 
 
22.3 Adoption of report 
222. The report was adopted. 
 
22.4 Close of meeting 
223. The meeting closed at 1:30am, 20 October 2007.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
I would like to extend our welcome to the Chair, members of the Commission, delegates, 
observers, the Chair of the SC and CC and the staff of the Secretariat.  We are here for 
the 14th meeting of the CCSBT. 
 
The Members of CCSBT are all friends; we have met many times in the past and have 
been able to resolve many difficult matters successfully.  Recently, all Members of this 
Commission met at the APEC meeting in Sydney and had fruitful and cooperative 
discussions on a range of issues as would be expected among friends. And, of course, we 
are major trading partners. 
 
We have had our differences in the CCSBT and the public is aware of these issues.  
However, as friends we have been able to work together to overcome many problems and 
we can overcome these as well. It is time to move forward. 
 
The world views the CCSBT through these incidents. We need to work together to deal 
with the matters that have arisen as a result of these issues and demonstrate to the public 
that we can effectively manage the southern bluefin tuna resource and also ensure that 
our activities do not result in adverse ecosystem impacts. 
 
The way that this Commission carries out its business is important and some may 
consider that it has hampered our ability to make progress. This may be due, in part, to 
the ‘old style’ convention of the CCSBT and the lack of transparency associated with 
rules regarding confidentiality.  We are looking forward to discussing the way we 
conduct our work and we look forward to the independent review of the Commission in 
the coming year. We hope that the independent review will highlight those issues that 
require improvement to ensure a more effective and efficient CCSBT. 
 
Last year we considered key issues that would impact upon the long-term sustainability 
of the southern bluefin tuna resource. We were able to take positive steps and agreed on 
national allocations.  We do not believe this issue needs further discussion at this meeting.  
We have taken the advice of Scientific Committee (SC) and reduced the total allowable 
catch to within the range recommended by the SC. 
 
However, these allocations were based on the ability to keep catches by all fleets within 
the agreed limits and to ensure that illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing was 
eliminated.  To achieve this we need an integrated system of monitoring, control and 
surveillance (MCS) measures, including a catch documentation scheme (CDS), vessel 
monitoring systems (VMS) and transshipment measures. We will also need to agree in 
the near future on other measures including port state measures and observer programmes. 
We need to agree and implement effective measures for MCS measures recognizing that 
MCS is the backbone of sound sustainable management. 
 
Australia also acknowledges that science is also important to ensure the sustainability of 
SBT stocks.  Over the last 20 years Australia has expended about $50 million on research 
related to SBT and we have not always received a return on this investment.  For example, 
we have expended considerable time and funds on establishment of a management 
procedure, but this cannot go ahead at this time due to problems with historical data. In 
order to move forward with implementation of the management procedure we need to 
ensure that the information that is used for this procedure is accurate. Again, MCS 
measures are critical here.   
 
I have so far focused issues that are specific to the  CCSBT, but we have relationship 
with other RFMOs, such as CCAMLR, WCPFC, IOTC and ICCAT.  The tuna RFMOs 
were the focus of the meeting in Kobe in January 2007 and at Kobe we agreed that we 
need to work together to harmonize measures to ensure the effective conservation of 
stocks. This harmonization focused on MCS issues, but also considered matters of 
science. We believe it is important that the CCSBT engage in processes to ensure 
effective harmonization with other RFMOs, with the matters of CDS, VMS and 
transshipment among the most urgent. 
 
Of course, RFMOs are made up their members States and fishing entities.  We all work 
together effectively in other RFMOs, the WCPFC is a key example, and we should be 
able to do the same at this RFMO. 
 
We also need to look beyond developments at RFMOs and recognize the importance 
given to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) fisheries resolution, the 
Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES) and the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and other agreements 
and the role this are playing in ocean governance and fisheries management. If we do not 
deal effectively with important issues at the CCSBT, it is likely that these issues will be 
discussed and resolved elsewhere.  
 
Australia recognizes the primacy of RFMOs and that fully functional, effective RFMOs 
are important to ensure the sustainability of fishery resources.  Australia wants the 
CCSBT to be able to demonstrate to the world that this RFMO can effectively manage 
the southern bluefin tuna fishery and ensure that there are no adverse impacts on the 
environment where the fishery takes place. 
 
I also need make a brief statement to advise you that a Federal election has been called in 
Australia and the Australian Government has entered caretaker mode. 
 
Under the caretaker conventions, any agreement on Australia’s behalf will be subject to 
the endorsement of the incoming government.  We do not anticipate any difficulties in 
this regard as these discussions are part of Australia’s long-term policy on fisheries.  
However, we are required to make this brief statement to inform members. 
 
Thank you

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen. 
 
First and foremost, on behalf of the Taiwan delegation, I would like to express my 
sincere gratitude to the Government of Australia for providing this excellent inspiring 
venue to hold our meeting. I would also like to extend our thanks to all staffs of the 
Secretariat for preparing this meeting although some Secretariat’s work needs to be 
improved, in particular the efficiency of administrative operation. In respect of logistic 
support in each meeting from the Secretariat, we hope the discussion paper for each 
agenda item able to be provided to members for review prior to the meetings as practiced 
in the past. 
 
At the last Extended Commission meeting, members recognized the critical importance 
of adopting and fully implementing at the earlier possible time an integrated package of 
compliance measures. In April this year, the first meeting of the Compliance Committee 
Working Group was held in response to the mandate from the Extended Commission. 
Basically, we support the direction that CCSBT has been moving forward in meeting the 
objectives for the SBT fishery. However, taking into account the feasibility and cost 
effectiveness in implementation while being broadly applied to all fisheries, we believe 
the MCS measures shall be designed in a manner in coincidence with a common principle 
which was reached at the first joint meeting of tuna RFMOs in January this year in Kobe, 
Japan, emphasizing the need for harmonization and consistency among RFMOs. Since 
our fishing vessels fishing for tunas cover three oceans, we therefore consider that any 
measure adopted in CCSBT shall be consistent with those measures taken by other 
RFMOs.  
 
Basing on that concept, over the past one year, the ongoing discussed draft proposal in 
relation to Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) draws our most attention and concern. 
Among the MCS measures, CDS has been recognized by members as the first priority to 
reach agreement in this meeting. As we all know, the purpose of the establishment of 
CDS is to try to collect essential information for tracking SBT. It is important and 
necessary for mutually complementary with other compliance measures in order to 
combat IUU fishing. We really support to establish such a mechanism, but more willing 
to request that the measure could be fulfilled as easy as possible. We do not hope to see 
any proposed approach become a heavy burden to the fishermen in the midst of up-rising 
oil price in recent years, or become a trade barrier in the end. We have noted that two 
proposals have been put forward respectively by members in this meeting for our 
deliberation. It is hoped the members can develop an applicable approach to be taken 
willingly by the tuna fishing and farming industry.  
 
From the sharing of SBT quota allocation among members decided at the last Extended 
Commission meeting, we have also noted that the SBT allocation for farming purpose 
accounts for almost half of TAC. When we try to establish an integrated MCS measures, 
we should consider the balance between marine fishery and farming fishery. In this 
meeting, we encourage members heading for that direction. 
 
In addition, there are a lot of issues that we also concern in this meeting, such as 
Australian SBT farming study, results of ERS working group meeting, and progress of 
scientific stock assessment. We hope members have more concrete discussions during 
this meeting.  
 
Due to the SBT spawning areas emerging in the Indonesian waters, the full cooperation 
from the Indonesian government will help the management and conservation of SBT 
resources. We are glad to hear that the Indonesian government is preparing to apply for 
acceding to CCSBT. Taiwan would express its greatest welcome to the accession of 
Indonesia to CCSBT. 
 
Lastly, we look forward to working constructively, and in a spirit of cooperation, with 
you all over the next few days this week and further producing fruitful results.  
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Japan 
 
Chairman and distinguished delegates, good morning. 
 
First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to officers of the Secretariat who 
made enormous effort to hold this meeting and officers of the Australian Government for 
hosting the meeting.  I assume that the officers faced many difficulties in preparing for 
the meeting, but the officers have provided wonderful environments for the meeting.   As 
I am Japanese, I cannot figure out how important the Old Parliament House is in 
Australia.  It is a great pleasure for me to be able to participate in the annual meeting of 
the CCSBT which is held in this historical and momentous building. 
 
Since the annual meeting last year, we have made efforts to resolve issues and increase 
mutual understanding by holding  a number of workshops, working group meetings and 
informal bilateral meetings.  In Japan, we have contributed to the development of the 
Extended Commission through our limited ability by holding the CPUE workshop in 
May, the ERS (Environmentally Related Species) working group meeting in July and an 
informal meeting on compliance in September. 
 
In regard to compliance, Japan not only participated in meetings but also made efforts to 
further enhance compliance by continuing the SBT individual tagging system which was 
introduced from April 2006 onwards, continuing the fishing vessel IQ (Individual Quota) 
system and commencing VMS operations.  We consider that introduction of the CDS 
(Catch Documentation Scheme) is one of the important elements for enhanced 
compliance in the future.  On the basis of the discussions in the Compliance Committee’s 
working group meeting in April this year, we drafted a Japanese proposal for the CDS 
and submitted it to the CCSBT.  In accordance with the resolution on the CDS which was 
adopted last year and the  principles for the CDS which was agreed in the year before last, 
the CDS should accurately monitor all catches from the stage of catches, including 
recreational catches.  Additionally, we consider that details required by the CDS should 
be applied impartially and equally to all fisheries, including long-line fishing, purse seine 
fishing and recreational fishing. 
 
In regard to compliance, Japan pointed out the issues of Australia’s purse seine fishing 
and fish farming at the 12th annual meeting of the CCSBT, which was held in October 
2005.  Two years have passed since then, but great concerns still remain concerning catch 
volume by purse seine fishing and representativeness of the 40 fish sampling.  
Additionally, in regard to duties of observers who go onboard Australian fishing vessels, 
only records of embarkation are provided.  We hear that actual growth of SBT in farming 
varies according to producer (company) and according to farming pen; however there 
have not been any explanations with specific figures at all to date. 
 
Japan is very concerned about this situation and submitted a document titled 
“Comparison of age frequencies for the Australian farmed southern bluefin tuna between 
40 fish sampling and harvest data” to the Extended Scientific Committee meeting this 
year in order to contribute to SBT resource management.  Japanese scientists analysed in 
the said document that catches by Australian purse seine fishing were mainly three-year 
old fish and estimated that 5,750 tonnes to 6,296 tonnes of SBT were caught in the 2003-
04 fishing season and that 6,910 tonnes to 7,897 tonnes of SBT were caught in the 2004-
05 fishing season.  As catch volume by purse seine fishing reported by the Australian 
Government are 4,874 tonnes in the 2003-04 fishing season and 5,215 tonnes in the 2004-
05 fishing season, it is probable that approximately 1,000 tonnes to 2,500 tonnes were 
over caught by Australian purse seine fishing every year. 
 
Japan feels that what is worst is the stereo video camera which Australia repeatedly 
explained.  In the Extended Scientific Committee meeting last year, a representative of 
Australian scientists explained that “it would be able to be commercialised immediately 
as the technology had been established”.  In the meeting of the Extended Commission 
after that, it was explained that “additional experiments were needed in order to 
commercialise the technology and therefore opinions of other members would be taken 
into account if there were good methods for investigation”.  This year, Australia again 
requested the Extended Scientific Committee that “observation of experimental pens 
would be necessary by using a stereo video camera in order to increase precision of 
technology and therefore Australia would need 15 tonnes of RMA (Research Mortality 
Allowance) for investigation”.  We are not asking for research for the sake of research 
nor 100% precision.  What we are asking for is a practical and specific investigation of 
commercial farms in order to ensure compliance.  As long as Australia maintains that 
they do not have methods to directly check catch volume by purse seine fishing, it is 
necessary to investigate SBT farming from a stage of transferring SBT from a towing 
cage to pens until harvesting. 
 
Although such a request was already made several years ago, substantial improvement 
has not been made at all in the management of Australian farming in the past two years.  
In the meeting of the Extended Scientific Committee this year, we agreed to undertake 
stock assessment by not using the figures of catch volume by Australian purse seine 
fishing reported by the Australian government but by using a scenario which includes 
increase of the said reported figure by 20% and  shift of a size composition from two-year 
and three-year old fish to four-year old fish.  I would like to ask the Australian side to 
consider this situation seriously by all means and contribute to better management of 
SBT farming.  In order to help contribute to better management of SBT farming, Japan 
submitted a “proposal concerning compliance measures for SBT farming” to the annual 
meeting this year.  We hope that the said proposal will be adopted in the meeting this 
year so that compliance in SBT farming will be improved even slightly.  In order to 
contribute to appropriate resource management of SBT, Japan proposes the use of an 
acoustic echo camera in the meeting this year for monitoring of catch volume by 
Australian purse seine fishing.  This is different from the stereo video camera, which is at 
an experimental stage, but is a technology already commercialised in North America etc. 
for specific measurement of fish. 
 
Finally, I would like to touch upon the management of recreational fishing.  In recent 
years, catch volume by Australian recreational fishing has not been reported.  In New 
Zealand, about four tonnes of quota for recreational fishing is managed within the 
national catch allocation; however such a measure is not taken in Australia.  
Approximately 80 tonnes of catches were reported in the past, but since then there has not 
been any report at all.  Such an attitude by the Australian side resulted in deep doubts by 
us.  Last year, members of the Extended Commission took an extremely careful approach 
in approving 10 tonnes to 45 tonnes of catch quotas for cooperating non-members and 
called for catch reports.  We heard that five tonnes of SBT were caught in one 
recreational fishing competition in Australia.  If nobody is able to explain annual catches 
by recreational fishing, we consider that such a situation is regarded as a problem by 
other countries.  We intend to request that the Australian side provide explanations 
concerning such doubts and take measures in good faith. 
 
Lastly, I would like to close my opening statement by wishing that we will be able to 
exchange views and hold discussions on a wide range of matters with members of the 
Extended Commission and that the meeting will be fruitful.   
 
Thank you, Mr. chairman.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Mr Chairman, I will be brief.  Firstly my thanks to Australia for hosting this meeting, and 
the fine weather and venue that they have provided for us this week.  The Extended 
Commission is again at a crossroad following the important decisions made at CCSBT 13. 
These decisions were premised on the fact that the Extended Commission would continue 
to make progress on the development of a monitoring control and surveillance system to 
provide confidence to members that reported levels of catch in the fishery reflect the 
actual catches that occur.  
 
There are also other important decisions for the Extended Commission at this meeting to 
bring it into line with international best practice. These include a review of the Extended 
Commission’s performance, and decisions in relation to ecologically related species. On 
the last issue we note that in our view the Extended Commission lags behind world best 
practice. 
 
As always New Zealand is here to work constructively with other members. That 
willingness is qualified by our view that the Extended Commission must make real 
progress on important issues.  
 
We note that to date progress on monitoring control and surveillance measures has been 
slow. We urge members to consider all options that will allow us to make positive 
progress at this meeting.

Opening Statement by the Republic of Korea 
 
Mr. Chair, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 
 
On behalf of the Korean delegation, I would like to thank the Australian Government for 
hosting this meeting and to convey my sincere respect and gratitude to all of delegates for 
their valuable support this meeting. 
 
It is a great honour and pleasure for us to meet delegations of the Member States, 
Cooperating Non-member States and representatives of various organizations that share 
common interests in Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT). 
 
Korea believes that many important factors of MCS will be addressed and discussed to 
strengthen conservation measures for SBT.   
 
MCS Measures are a key tool in eliminating IUU fishing and will contribute to Members' 
conservation efforts and provide opportunities for strengthen to its national regulations 
for SBT fishery.  
 
For effective resources management, all member countries should work together to 
establish all necessary measures against IUU fishing activities. As responsible fishing 
nations, we all should take an active part in activities to combat IUU fishing. Korea is 
also determined to cooperate with other member states in establishing all necessary 
measures to eventually eliminate IUU fishing activities.  
 
The all relevant CPCs’s participation in MCS programmes designed to conserve and 
manage SBT would enhance the Commission’s international standing and credibility to 
the world as one of the successful RFMOs and could serve as a beacon for the MSY of 
SBT.   
 
Adoption of robust MCS thru the thorough consultation among the relevant CPCs would 
add a crucial element to the Commission‘s contribution to conservation efforts and MSY 
of SBT. 
 
There is a need for prompt conservation and management measures, however, it should 
be implemented in a feasible and fair manner within the extent of which all member 
states will be able to practically and physically accommodate, taking into account each 
state's fishing situation.  
 
As a responsible deep sea fishing nation, Korea looks forward to working with you 
during the next few days for making progress on decisions concerning MCS programs for 
protecting our common asset and MSY of SBT.    
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the Philippines 
 
Before anything else, I would like to thank the Government of Australia, on behalf of the 
Philippine delegation, for hosting the CCSBT 14 meeting in this beautiful and peaceful 
city of Canberra. 
 
The Philippines since becoming a Cooperating Non-Member of the CCSBT in 2004 and 
has participated actively and fully for the conservation and management of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna although with only a by-catch quota of 45 mt. 
 
Mr. Chairman, the Philippines adheres to the principles enunciated in the UN Convention 
on the Law of the Sea  (UNCLOS) particularly the agreement for the Implementation of 
the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea relating to the 
Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish 
Stocks (UNIA). To demonstrate our commitment towards the conservation and 
management of tunas in all oceans of the world, the Philippines become a member of 
ICCAT, IOTC and WCPFC. 
 
We participate in this CCSBT 14 meeting not only to show our Commitment but more 
importantly to put forward our National aspirations in the light of the current national 
quota allocation and compliance requirement issues. 
 
The Philippine delegation welcomes the agenda for this meeting and looks forward to 
discuss the different agenda items with other delegations. 
 
Thank you. 
 
Attachment 5-2 
 
Opening Statement by the Republic of South Africa 
 
Mr Chairman, South Africa had a short-lived longline fishery targeting southern bluefin 
tuna in the 1960s.  This fishery caught more than 1500t of southern bluefin tuna in 
coastal waters between 1960 and 1968.  The fishery was finally abandoned in the late 
1960s due to poor pricing and declining catch rates.  It was only in 1997 that South 
Africa redeveloped its tuna longline fishery.  This fishery operated under experimental 
conditions until 2004 and mainly targeted swordfish, bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna.  
The fishery was finally commercialised in 2005.  Hence, South Africa’s longline fishery 
is relatively new and is still in the process of being developed. 
 
Some of the challenges encountered in developing our domestic longline fishery are the 
shortage of skills and vessels to target tuna effectively.  In addressing these challenges 
South Africa has allowed Right Holders to enter into charter agreements with foreign 
vessel owners for a limited time period as a means of transferring skills to South Africans.  
This stringently managed joint venture programme also makes provision for vessels to re-
flag to South Africa thereby providing suitable vessels for our developing fishery. 
 
Mr Chairman, with regard to southern bluefin tuna, South Africa is a range state with 
southern bluefin tuna occurring inside our exclusive economic zone (EEZ) during certain 
times of the year.  Despite southern bluefin tuna occurring in South Africa’s waters our 
landings of this species has been relatively small as the domestic vessels have generally 
not targeted this species due to marketing challenges and the problem of unsuitable 
vessels to target these species effectively.  However, this situation will change in the near 
future as the joint venture programme continues with the assistance of foreign flagged 
vessels. 
 
South Africa acknowledges that southern bluefin tuna stocks have been severely depleted 
and has co-operated with CCSBT to ensure that all the management and conservation 
measures have been implemented for our domestic fishery, including the submission of 
catch and effort statistics, size frequencies, and vessel registers.  Moreover, South Africa 
has ensured that all fishing vessels are equipped with VMS, foreign vessels carry 
scientific observers on all fishing trips, size sampling on board vessels are excellent, 
catch logbooks are detailed, and that the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF) is 
implemented.  We have also improved our system for issuing catch statistical documents 
this year and we are currently working on a system to improve the reporting of catch 
statistical documents accompanying imports. 
 
South Africa wishes to assure the Members of this Commission that we remain 
committed to efforts in eradicating IUU fishing activity and as such we are continually 
improving upon our Port State Control measures.  In addition, four patrol vessels have 
also been acquired to improve compliance in our waters.  South Africa has an important 
role to play in the management and conservation of southern bluefin tuna given:  
1) the close proximity of South Africa to one of the most important international 
fishing grounds for this species, and; 
2) the high usage of South African ports by foreign flagged fishing vessels. 
 
South Africa has much to offer CCSBT, but at this stage we are faced with capacity 
constraints for meeting attendance.  Furthermore, due to the small country allocation of 
40t and the fact that our fishery currently catches southern bluefin tuna predominantly as 
a by-catch of swordfish, bigeye and yellowfin tuna targeting, South Africa is unable to 
commit to becoming a full member of the CCSBT at this time. 
 
Mr Chairman, we thank you for this opportunity to bring these matters before the 
Commission.

Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Good morning distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 
 
On behalf of the Indonesian Government, I would like to thank the Executive Secretary 
of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and the Government 
of Australia for including Indonesia in the Extended Commission to the 14th Annual 
Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of SBT.   
   
May I take this opportunity to once again express Indonesia’s interest in joining the 
CCSBT as a full member.  In this regard I should like to advise this forum that to upgrade 
Indonesia’s status from an observer to a full member, we have to undergo an internal 
legal process. 
 
The Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries of Indonesia has gained great support from 
relevant agencies.  To date we are awaiting for the Presidential Decree for Indonesia to 
become a full member of CCSBT.  
 
Thank you. 
 
 
 
 
 
Attachment 6-2 
 
Opening Statement by the Humane Society International 
 
Humane Society International (HSI) welcomes the opportunity to be present as an 
Observer at this 14th Annual Meeting of the Commission.  
 
While HSI has a longstanding concern for the sustainability of the southern bluefin tuna 
(SBT) population, our foremost concern for this particular meeting is to see the problems 
of seabird, shark and marine turtle bycatch addressed as a matter of urgency.  
 
The CCSBT management area overlaps with the distribution of 17 of the world’s 24 
albatross species. It is possibly the Regional Fisheries Management Organisation having 
the most significant impact on this group of birds, the majority of which are threatened 
with extinction. It is estimated that approximately 13,500 seabirds are killed in CCSBT 
fisheries annually, and that 10,000 of these birds are species of albatross. 
 
Since 1997 the CCSBT has required the compulsory use of tori lines (bird scaring lines) 
in its longline fishing operations below 30 degrees south. While tori poles do deter 
seabirds, experience internationally is that they are not an effective enough mitigation 
measure to reduce seabird bycatch to ecologically sustainable levels. It is therefore not 
surprising that seabird mortality rates reported to the CCSBT have remained consistently 
high in the ten years since the measure was adopted.  
 
A number of other mitigation measures are available which can be used in conjunction 
with tori lines that are proving to be effective in minimising seabird bycatch in other 
longline fishing operations. For example, the options of night setting and line weighting 
have seen seabird bycatch rates decline dramatically at the Commission for the 
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, so much so that the CCAMLR 
Scientific Committee reported that no albatross were observed captured in the regulated 
longline fisheries in the CCAMLR Convention Area in 2005/2006. 
 
HSI strongly urges CCSBT Members to agree to the urgent adoption of night setting and 
line weighting as mandatory measures, coupled with other bait protection strategies, 
during all SBT longline fishing operations. Without a requirement for either night setting 
or line weighting, HSI is concerned that the CCSBT fisheries will continue to be 
responsible for unacceptable seabird mortality rates. 
 
Further, HSI recommends that seabird mitigation measures be applied south of 25° south 
because data from Australia shows that threatened species of albatross and petrel are 
caught between 30 and 25 degrees latitude. This has led the Australian Government to 
require seabird mitigation measures in its pelagic longline fleet south of 25 degrees. 
 
To address the problem of shark bycatch, HSI recommends the adoption of a non 
retention policy, a prohibition on the use of wire traces, closures for high risk areas and 
times and a total prohibition on finning in the form of a requirement that any sharks that 
are retained should be landed with their fins attached naturally to their carcasses.  
 
HSI calls for an urgent investigation into the extent of marine turtle bycatch in SBT 
longline fisheries, particularly those operating on the SBT spawning grounds where the 
risk of turtle bycatch is likely to be high.  
 
HSI believes the CCSBT will be viewed unfavourably if decisive action is not taken to 
address these serious problems this year. Such action was called for in the United Nations 
General Assembly Resolution on Sustainable Fisheries 2006 and would be consistent 
with the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, the FAO International Plan of 
Action for Reducing Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries and the FAO 
International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks.

Opening Statement by TRAFFIC International 
 
Thank you Mr Chairman. 
 
TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, would like to thank the Commissioners 
of the Convention for this opportunity to participate as an observer to the meetings of the 
Commission and Extended Commission. We look forward to assisting with these critical 
deliberations and the implementation of its decisions, so as to ensure continued progress 
on the conservation of southern bluefin tuna and its ecologically related species. 
 
TRAFFIC views the acceptance of non-government observers into the deliberations of 
the Commission as the first step in adding transparency into the process that surrounds 
CCSBT. There are many steps to be taken with the transparency of catch and trade to 
ensure that IUU fishing for SBT by Members and Non-Members becomes an action of 
the past. We consider at CCSBT13 that those steps have been planned for with the 
agreement of Resolutions on a Catch Documentation Scheme, Vessel Monitoring System 
and Transhipment.  It is imperative that these Resolutions are fully developed and 
implemented as soon as possible and that discussions on integrated monitoring, control 
and surveillance systems that began at CCSBT13 continue. 
 
TRAFFIC supports the development of the management procedure within CCSBT, but 
we maintain a focus on its full implementation as a priority and that discussions focus on 
returning SBT stocks to those that can be considered biologically safe as “the spawning 
biomass is at a low fraction of its original biomass and well below the 1980 level as well 
as below the level that could produce maximum sustainable yield.” . We recognize that 
there are concerns with the historical catch data for determining catch levels, but do not 
believe this should allow for further delays in implementation and that a suitably 
precautionary procedure should be adopted immediately. 
 
TRAFFIC is concerned by the lack of progress in ensuring the conservation of 
ecologically related species and of particular concern to TRAFFIC is the lack of adequate 
controls over the catch and retention of sharks. 
 
Finally, Mr Chairman, TRAFFIC has been participating in these discussions for the last 
14 years and we consider progress by CCSBT has seen major ups and downs over that 
time. However, TRAFFIC looks forward to when we can fully associate transparency of 
process, catch and trade with the Convention and that we are all confident we have SBT 
and its ecologically related species on a confirmed sustainable footing. 
 
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

Opening Statement by World Wildlife Fund 
 
Mr Chairman, 
 
WWF welcomes the opportunity to observe the 14th meeting of the Commission for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.  We hope that allowing WWF and other non-
government organizations to observe this meeting, signals a new approach by the 
Commission towards more transparency in the management of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
fisheries. 
 
Two important areas that WWF has focused on in respect of this Commission have been 
the status of the target stock and the impact of SBT fishing on non-target species. 
 
With the SBT stock still considered to be at critically low levels, WWF considers that the 
scientific uncertainty associated with determining catch levels dictates the need for the 
immediate adoption of precautionary management arrangements through implementation 
of the management procedure. 
 
Relative to other Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, WWF is concerned at 
the lack of progress by CCSBT to address the impacts of the fisheries on non-target 
species.  We are aware that all members of the Commission are members or cooperating 
non-members of other RFMOs and/or CCAMLR, where bycatch information is not only 
collected and independently verified, but mitigation measures that seek to reduce the take 
of seabirds, sharks and other marine species are also in place.  It is unclear why there is a 
sustained reluctance to implement measures in the southern bluefin tuna fisheries that you 
have already agreed to and adopted in other regional forums. 
 
We urge the CCSBT to build on the successes we have seen in other forums and 
immediately adopt consistent data collection standards, observer programs and mitigation 
measures, to understand and reduce impacts on non-target species.  To assist 
governments in such considerations, we would like to draw delegates attention to a recent 
WWF publication that examines issues concerning ecologically-related species in 
southern bluefin tuna fisheries1.  The report provides a series of strong recommendations 
to address the issues that appear to persist in the management of non-target species in the 
CCSBT. 
 
WWF looks forward to contributing to these issues and others as the meeting progresses 
and as always, to working with individual Members to ensure that the Commission is 
implementing processes that reflect the very highest standards and principles of 
sustainable fisheries management.

1. Introduction 
This report summarises catches and fishing activities in the 2004–05 and 2005–06 quota years1 of the 
Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus maccoyii; SBT) Fishery. It also provides preliminary data on the 
2006–07 surface fishery. 
 
The Australian domestic SBT catches for the 2005 and 2006 calendar years were 5244 t and 5635 t, 
respectively. The 2006 calendar year catch is larger than the previously agreed national allocation to 
Australia of 5265 t because it represents the aggregation of catches from periods in two quota years. The 
2004–05 quota year catch was 5248 t; and for the 2005–06 quota year catch was 5308 t.

1 Various time periods, such as ‘calendar years’, ‘fishing seasons’ and ‘quota years’, can be used when describing Australia’s SBT 
fishery. Unless otherwise indicated, we have used quota years in this report, but note that fishing seasons of the various fishery 
components often span quota years. The start and end dates of Australian quota years have varied and are presented in Appendix 1.

2. Operational Constraints on Effort 
Regulatory Measures 
Domestic operations are managed through individual transferable quotas (ITQs) granted as Statutory Fishing 
Rights (SFRs) under the Southern Bluefin Tuna Management Plan 1995. 
 
The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) uses a risk based compliance strategy in the SBT 
purse seine and longline fisheries. This includes targeted compliance operations to check fishing vessels at 
sea, and at landing ports; a comprehensive audit trail from the time SBT are caught to the time they are 
exported, including random audits of fishing companies and export establishments; and then an annual 
review of compliance risks leading to refined strategies for the following season. 
 
Australia has continued to use a combination of area restrictions, minimum quota holdings, fishery observers, 
and mandatory Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) to reduce the incidental catch and mortality of SBT 
caught in the domestic longline fishery. A SBT habitat model incorporating archival tag and observer data 
with sea surface and sub-surface temperatures, is used to predict likely areas of high SBT abundance and 
hence the location of restricted access zones. In the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF), areas with a 
high probability of SBT interactions have been determined and are referred to as the Core Zone and Buffer 
Zone. For the 2004–05 season, access to the Core Zone during the months of May to October was subject to 
100% observer coverage, and mandatory minimum quota requirements. Access to the Buffer Zone was 
subject to 25% observer coverage, and mandatory minimum quota requirements. These requirements were 
modified for the 2005–06 season so that the level of observer coverage depended on the amount of quota 
carried, as per Table 2.

To improve compliance and management outcomes for its domestic fishery, and to better meet international 
management obligations, Australia implemented a range of amendments to its Southern Bluefin Tuna 
Management Plan 1995 on 1 December 2004. These included: 
• 
revised objectives, management measures, and performance criteria; 
• 
incorporation of the Commission's current stock-specific reference point; 
• 
the development of a by-catch action plan and strategies to reduce broader environmental impacts; 
• 
amendments to enhance the accountability of SBT Statutory Fishing Right holders against their 
allocated quota; and, 
5 
• 
daily at sea reporting of SBT taken and transferred into tow cages, provisional deduction of SBT 
quota based on at sea estimates of catch, and daily VMS or manual reporting of catch and tow 
vessel locations. 
 
3. Catch and Effort 
In 2005–06, 99.9% of the Australian catch of SBT was taken by purse seine with the remainder taken by 
longline. Australian catch by gear and State for the quota years 1988–89 to 2005–06 is shown in Table 1. 
Catch by season with number of vessels and vessel search hours is at Appendix 3. The Australian catch of 
SBT for the calendar years 2005 and 2006 is mapped in Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively.

Insufficient data were available to provide an estimate of the recreational catch in 2005 and 2006. 
Discards 
During the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons, no discarding of SBT was observed or reported in logbooks 
collected in the purse seine fishery in the Great Australian Bight.  
 
In 2004, AFMA observers monitored longline operations in the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery during the 
months and areas in which SBT are most likely to be taken incidentally (i.e. south of 30oS from May to 
September). Observer data showed that 61% of longline caught SBT were discarded during the observed 
operations. In contrast, the level of SBT discards recorded in logbooks from other vessels fishing during the 
same period south of 30oS was only 10%. In response to this new information the Australian Fisheries 
Management Authority has implemented tighter access controls and implemented 100% observer coverage 
for the 2005 and 2006 season in areas and at times where there is a high risk of SBT being caught. Note that 
this definition is more restricted than the definition outlined above for when and where SBT are most likely 
to be taken.

In 2006 in the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF), south of 30º S and during the months of May to 
September (the months in which SBT are usually caught), 17 observers monitored 126 thousand hooks of a 
season total of 416 thousand, representing 30.2% observer coverage of longline effort during the SBT 
migration. The total catch number of SBT caught while observers were on board was 39 of which 17 were 
retained, 21 were discarded (20 of which were released alive) and 1 was tagged. Note that tagged fish have 
not been included as discarded fish. Individual retained fish ranged from 116–193 cm in length. The size 
distribution of the discarded ETBF longline catch of SBT from 2002 to 2005 is shown in Figure 1. ETBF 
logbooks for 2006 showed 6 tonnes (73 fish) of SBT were retained in the ETBF fishery and only 3 (4%) 
were discarded. Further details on discarding are provided in Attachment 1. 
 
During 2006, BRS observers monitored 2% of longline operations in the Southern and Western Tuna and 
Billfish Fishery. There were no SBT observed caught in the fishery in 2006. 
4. Historical Catch and Effort 
Australian catch by gear and State for the quota years 1988–89 to 2005–06 is shown in Table 5. Catch and 
effort (number of search hours and number of vessels) by season, for seasons 1994–95 to 2006–07, in the 
purse seine fishery are show in Table 4.

Overall the data available on recreational catch of SBT is limited but an initial review revealed high 
year-to-year variability in catches and the locations in which SBT were taken. For the past ten years, 
indicative estimates of annual recreational catches ranged between 3 and 85 tonnes with the highest catches 
occurring around Tasmania (Table 6). These data are indicative estimates only and are based on a range of 
different data sources.

While there are insufficient data at present to quantify the total recreational catches of SBT for 2004–05 and 
2005–06, high spatial catch variability was evident from anecdotal reports. 2004–05 was a good season in 
South Australia but poor elsewhere, especially in Tasmania where the annual southern bluefin tuna 
tournament produced very disappointing catches of SBT (i.e. no SBT were caught). In 2005–06, South 
Australia, Victoria and Tasmania experienced a good season for recreational SBT catches.

5. Annual Fleet Size and Distribution 
In 2005–06, a total of 14 commercial fishing vessels landed SBT in Australian waters. 
South Australia 
The one- to five-year-old SBT, which school from late spring to autumn in surface waters of the eastern 
Great Australian Bight, South Australia, were fished by seven purse seiners during the 2005–06 quota year, 
but various live bait, pontoon-towing and feeding vessels were also involved. Fishing commenced in mid 
December 2005 and finished in mid March 2006 for the season. There was some further finishing at the end 
of November 2006, which falls into this quota year. 
Western Australia  
There was no fishing for SBT off Western Australia in the 2005–06 quota year. 
New South Wales 
During 2005–06, seven domestic longliners participated at some time in the area of the fishery for older 
juveniles and adults in deeper waters off NSW. Longline fishing off NSW commenced in early June 2006 
and finished at end of September 2006. 
11 
Tasmania 
There was no fishing for SBT off Tasmania in the 2005–06 quota year. 
Queensland 
There was no fishing for SBT off Queensland in the 2005–06 quota year. 
 
6. Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
Troll catches of SBT were reported as early as the 1920s off the east coast of Australia but significant 
commercial fishing for SBT commenced in the early 1950s with the establishment of a pole-and-live-bait 
fishery off New South Wales, South Australia and, later (1970), Western Australia. Purse seine gear overtook 
pole as the predominant method and catches peaked at 21 500 t in 1982. The bulk of this early Australian 
catch of SBT was canned. Following quota reductions in 1983–84, the Western Australian pole fishery for 
very small juveniles closed down and the south-eastern fishery began to target larger juveniles to supply the 
Japanese sashimi market. Surface catches were further reduced between 1989 and 1995 when about half of 
the Australian total allowable catch (TAC) was taken by Australia–Japan joint venture longliners in the 
Australian Fishing Zone (AFZ). The joint venture ceased in late 1995. From 1992 to 1998, domestic 
longliners operating off Tasmania and New South Wales also took around 5–10% of the total Australian 
catch. 
 
In 1990–91 about 20 t of SBT tuna were transferred to fattening cages in Port Lincoln, South Australia, to 
enhance their value. Utilisation of the Australian SBT TAC in ‘farming’ operations increased from 3% of the 
TAC in 1991–92 to 98% in 1999–00 and it has remained at similar high levels since. 
 
Following declaration of the Australian Fishing Zone (AFZ) in 1979, Japanese longliners fished under a 
range of bilateral conditions, real time monitoring program and joint-venture arrangements until 1997 when 
Japanese longliners were excluded from all AFZ fishing operations following failure to reach agreement on 
global TAC within the CCSBT. Caton and Ward (1996) provide copies of annual subsidiary agreements for 
the operations of bilateral-licensed longliners in the AFZ from 1979–80 to 1994–95. 
 
7. Fisheries Monitoring 
There are a series of logbooks and associated catch records that are required by law to be completed by 
fishers and fish receivers and sent to AFMA for the purposes of monitoring, compliance and research. The 
type of form used is dependent on the type of method used to catch SBT in the fishery. All of the data 
provided from Logbooks and Catch Disposal Records must be supplied to AFMA within specified time 
periods specific to each record. 
12 
Catch Disposal Records 
Catch disposal records for SBT are for recording SBT taken by fishers for the purposes other than farming 
and are signed by the fishing concession holder and the first receiver immediately after unloading the catch. 
Catch disposal records provide a means to verify logbook data. 
Australian Daily Fishing Log and Farm Transit Log 
A logbook form is required to be completed by fishers when using pelagic longlining or when fishing with 
minor line methods. The Australian Pelagic Longline Daily Fishing Log is required to be completed for 
longline fishing. In the purse seine fishery the Master of the catcher vessel (with quota assigned) is required 
to complete the Australian Purse Seine and Pole Daily Fishing Log – for farmed SBT only. A specific permit 
called the Farm Transit Log is completed by the holder of the SBT carrier boat permit or representative, and 
provided to the monitoring company which undertakes the fish count when fish are transferred from tow 
cages to farm cages. 
Farm Disposal Record 
A specific process has been designed to obtain data to allow for research and monitoring from farming 
operations. An independent company is contracted annually by AFMA to monitor the farming operations. All 
mortalities that occur during the capture and towing operations must be recorded on the appropriate form and 
must be available for inspection if requested by an AFMA officer. 
 
When SBT are transferred from tow cages to the fish farms, a video record must be carried out by the AFMA 
contracted monitoring company. The video recording is then used to undertake a count of the fish that are 
transferred into the fish farm. This count of captured fish will be multiplied by the average fish weight 
(derived from a 40 fish sample) and decremented from quota using the Farm Disposal Record. AFMA 
Compliance Officers observed at sea operations during both the 2005/06 and the 2006/07 seasons. 
Observer Program 
Observer programmes for the purse seine fishery have been in place since the 2002/03 season, and for the 
longline fishery (south-eastern part of the ETBF) since the middle of 2002.  
 
The monitoring arrangements in the SBT fishery continue to be reviewed and refined in order to improve 
monitoring and compliance. To minimise the risk of non-quota take of SBT by longliners off New South 
Wales, since 2000, access to the waters through which SBT migrate has been restricted to vessels holding 
SBT quota. 
 
13 
8. Other Factors 
Import/Export Statistics 
The Trade Information Scheme that records all exported Australian fish has been implemented and refined.  
A Trade Information Scheme (TIS) form is completed by an authorised signatory from the export-registered 
establishment that is the last to handle the consignment before the product leaves Australia and validated by a 
Government officer. The form is used for both farmed and non-farmed SBT. This program provides a 
complete record of SBT exports that can be compared with the Japanese Import Statistics. 
Markets 
In 2005/06, 19.5t of SBT were retained for the Australian domestic market. 
During the period January 2006 to December 2006, SBT was exported to China (533kg); Great Britain 
(2,841kg); Hong Kong (158kg); Republic of Korea (489kg); Philippines (10kg); Thailand (74kg); United 
Arab Emirates (196kg); United States (72t); and Japan (8,561 t).  
During the period June 2006 to August 2006 SBT imports from New Zealand amounted to 1,261kg.  
Observer Coverage 
Purse Seine Fishery – Great Australian Bight 2006–07 
The purse seine observer programme for the 2006–07 Australian SBT fishing season monitored fishing and 
tow operations between 33 and 34oS and 131 and 133oE in January, February and March 2006. One 
Australian and one South African observer monitored 9 purse seine sets representing 5.6% of the total sets in 
which fish were taken in 2006–07. From these observations an estimated 280 tonnes of SBT were caught 
during observed sets representing 5.6% of the estimated tonnage caught for the 2006–07 season. Less than 
the 10% target coverage occurred during the 2006-07 season due to an unexpectedly low number of sets 
(effort), and as a result catches, that occurred on the observed voyages.  The low level of catches was likely 
to have been influenced by the time of year and environmental factors. 
 
Observers also monitored and recorded SBT mortalities on two towing operations. Observer coverage on 
purse seine vessels was limited to January, February and March hence the data is not necessarily 
representative of the entire fleet over the December to April purse seine fishing season. 
Longline Fishery  
In 2006 in the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF), south of 30º S and during the months of May to 
September (the months in which SBT are usually caught), 17 observers monitored 126 thousand hooks of a 
season total of 416 thousand, representing 30.2% observer coverage of longline effort. The total catch 
number of SBT caught while observers were on board was 39 of which 17 were retained, 21 were discarded 
(20 of which were released alive) and 1 was tagged. Note that tagged fish have not been included as 
discarded fish. Individual retained fish ranged from 116–193 cm in length. The size distribution of the 
14 
discarded ETBF longline catch of SBT from 2002 to 2005 is shown in Figure 1. ETBF logbooks for 2006 
showed 6 tonnes (73 fish) of SBT were retained in the ETBF fishery and only 3 (4%) were discarded. 
 
In 2006, in the Southern and Western Tuna and Billfish Fishery 2% of operations were observed. There were 
no SBT observed caught in the fishery in 2006.

Review of Taiwan’s SBT Fishery of 2005/2006 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Taiwan has been fishing for southern bluefin tuna (SBT) since 1970s. The SBT is being 
caught partly by seasonal target fishery and partly by the albacore fishery as by-catch. 
Seasonal target fishery is conducted mainly by longliners equipped with super-low 
temperature freezers, in two seasons, i.e. one from June to September and the other from 
October to February of the following year, in the waters around 30°S-35°S. However, no 
year-round target fishing has yet been conducted. The total annual catch in 2006 was 
preliminarily estimated to be 963 mt, increased by 22 mt from 941 in 2005. 
2. OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON EFFORT 
Regulatory Measures 
Taiwan became a member of the Extended Commission of CCSBT in 2002, and agreed 
to limit its annual catch of SBT to 1,140 mt. Fishing vessels for seasonal target fishery 
and by-catch on SBT are differentiated and individual quota has been allocated to each of 
the vessels in the two fisheries. Every vessel is required to register with the Taiwan Tuna 
Association, whether for target or by-catch fishery, and obtain prior approval from the 
government before catching SBT. In 2006 about 99.7% of the annual catch limit was 
allocated to the seasonal target vessels, while the remaining 0.3% to the by-catch vessels. 
In order to collect SBT catch information in a timely manner and to control the total SBT 
catch not to exceed the catch limit, as from 1996 every vessel that catches SBT was 
required to submit weekly report on its catch of SBT by weight as well as its fishing 
location to the fisheries authorities. This system was refined in 2002 to obtain more 
accurate catch information, including the length measurement of each fish caught. In June 
2000, Taiwan began to implement a Trade Information Scheme (TIS) for the export of 
SBT, meeting the requirement of TIS as adopted by CCSBT. As from 2002, all vessels 
fishing for SBT have been required to be installed satellite-based Vessel Monitoring 
                                     Attachment 8-2 
 
 
2
System (VMS) for transmitting the positions of vessels in a timely manner to the 
monitoring center. Fishing in spawning area of SBT as suggested by Scientific 
Committee is prohibited and document of TIS will not be issued to any fish caught from 
the spawning area to protect the spawning stock. 
3. CATCH AND EFFORT 
In the 2006 fishing season, the actual catch was 963 mt caught by 36 active vessels, 
including seasonal target and by-catch fishery. About 93% of the Taiwanese SBT catch 
was caught in the southern and central Indian Ocean, and remaining 7% in the 
southwestern Indian Ocean extending to the eastern boundary of the Atlantic Ocean. 
4. HISTORICAL CATCH AND EFFORT 
In the early 1980s, the annual catch of SBT was relatively small, with a catch of less than 
250 mt. Following the expansion of tuna long-line fleet and exploitation of fishing 
grounds, there has been a prominent increase in the annual catches. A significant increase 
in the annual catch of SBT was observed from 1989 to 1992, with a record catch of 
exceeding 1,100 mt, 1/4 of which was from drift net fishery. Following the prohibition of 
drift-net fishery on the high seas in 1993 in compliance with the United Nations General 
Assembly Resolution 46/215 calling for global moratorium on all large-scale pelagic 
drift-net fishing on the high seas of the world’s oceans and seas by 31 December 1992, 
the annual catch of SBT decreased to a stable level, with fluctuation between 800 and 
1,600 mt during the last decade (Table 1).  
5. ANNUAL FLEET SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION 
In 2006, there were 36 longline vessels fishing for SBT, of which most vessels operated 
in the Indian Ocean. Their fishing grounds were mainly in the waters of 20°S - 40°S, 
seasonally distributed in the southern and central Indian Ocean from June to September, 
and in the southwestern Indian Ocean extending to the eastern boundary of the Atlantic 
Ocean from October to February of the following year. 
6. HISTORICAL FLEET SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION 
 
3
Following the prohibition of drift-net fishing in 1993, SBT was caught only by longline 
fishery in the three oceans, but mainly in the Indian Ocean. According to the weekly 
report and trading information, there were more than 100 vessels fishing for SBT during 
1998-2001. Due to the quota management regulation set by Fisheries Agency, the number 
of vessels which were authorized to fish for SBT decreased drastically to 61 in 2002, 
increased to 100 in 2003, decreased to 92 in 2004, and further decreased to 57 in 2005 
and 36 in 2006. The number of vessels significantly decreased in 2005-2006 because 
partial vessels shifted to target on oilfish in the waters off South Africa. 
7. FISHERIES MONITORING 
Intensive efforts have been continuously exerted for better understanding and monitoring 
the fishery through the following measures: 
I. 
Weekly report for SBT catch is required for submission to Fisheries Agency through 
Taiwan Tuna Association. As from 2002, provision of such information as daily 
catch, daily fishing location and daily discards is required in the weekly report when 
applying for SBT statistical document. 
II. 
As from April 2002, vessels catching SBT are required to install VMS equipments 
in order to monitor the positions of the vessels. 
III. An experimental scientific observer program on SBT fisheries has been launched 
since 2002. In 2006, 3 observers were placed on 3 SBT fishing vessels. The observer 
coverage rate by hooks was about 12.78% and by catch about 4.26%. The low level 
of observed catch was the reason that, among 3 observed vessels, 2 changed their 
target species and departed from the SBT fishing ground.   
IV. TIS program has been implemented to collect updated and detailed catch 
information. In applying for TIS document, the applicant is required to submit the 
transshipment document issued by the cargo carriers. After unloading of the catch in 
Japan, the applicant is required to submit to Fisheries Agency the transaction record 
validated by the verification firm for further verification of catch statistics.

8. OTHER FACTORS 
Markets 
In 2006, about 817 mt SBT catch were exported to Japan for sashimi market and 23 mt 
were exported to South Africa. For the purpose of promotion, since 2006 Fisheries 
Agency has required industries to transship partial catch back to Taiwan for domestic 
consumption. In 2006, the amount of domestic consumption was about 123 mt, an 
increase of 112.5 mt compared to the previous year.  
Seabirds mitigation measures                                                                
On May 5, 2006, Fisheries Agency promulgated the National Plan of Action for 
Reducing the Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fsheries (NPOA-Seabirds) and 
simultaneously implemented regulations on the requirement of installation of tori lines on 
longline vessels operating in areas south of 28°S.

Review of Japanese SBT Fisheries in the 2006 Fishing Season 
 
1.  Preface 
 
In the 2005 fishing season, Japan discovered that its catch exceeded the allocated 
quota (6,065 tonnes) by 1,790 tonnes.  From the point of view of recovering and 
managing resources, Japan decided to restrain its actual catches by more than 1,500 
tonnes in the 2006 fishing season, and consequently Japan’s total catch in the 2006 
fishing season became 3,693 tonnes. 
 
Also, Japan drastically changed the SBT fisheries management system from the 2006 
fishing season.  The new system includes an individual SBT quota system for 
individual fisherman/fishing vessel, tagging requirement on fish caught and 
designation of ports where SBT is allowed to be unloaded.  The new system was 
introduced from 1 April 2006.  (Please refer to the appendix 1 concerning details.) 
 
2.  Operational restrictions on effort  
 
From the 2006 fishing season, the number of fishing vessels is restricted by allocating 
fishing quotas for individual fisherman/fishing vessel.   
In addition, the Japanese government dispatched patrol vessels to monitor Japanese 
tuna fishing vessels. 
 
3.  Catch and effort  
 
In the 2006 fishing season, 133 fishing vessels caught SBT, and there was no report of 
discarding from these fishing vessels.  There was no report of SBT catches by 
recreational fishery either.  All of the SBT caught by Japanese tuna fishing vessels are 
considered to be consumed in Japan. 
 
4.  Catch and effort in the past 
 
(1) In the 2000 fishing season, the Japanese government voluntarily established 
Japan’s quota at 4,578 tonnes, 1,487 tonnes less from the country quota of 
6,065 tonnes agreed in 1997.  However, as the ITLOS’s provisional measure 
was revoked in August 2000, Japan changed the voluntary quota to the 
original 6,065 tonnes in September 2000.  Actual catches by Japan in the 2000 
fishing season were 6,027 tonnes. 
(2) In the 2001 fishing season, Japan commenced fishing operations with the 
provisional quota of 6,065 tonnes.  After that, Japan consulted with other 
members concerned and decided its voluntary quota at 6,421 tonnes.  Actual 
catches by Japan in the 2001 fishing season were 6,647 tonnes. 
(3) In the 2002 fishing season, Japan commenced fishing operations with the 
provisional quota of 6,065 tonnes and actual catches were 6,192 tonnes. 
(4) In the 2003 fishing season, the Japanese government voluntarily reduced its 
quota by 226 tonnes from the 6,065 tonnes and set the quota at 5,839 tonnes.  
Actual catches were 5,770 tonnes. 
 
(5) In the 2004 fishing season, Japan set its quota at 6,007 tonnes by reducing 127 
tonnes of over catches in the 2002 fishing season from 6,065 tonnes and by 
adding 69 tonnes of unused quota in the 2003 fishing season.  Actual catches 
were 5,982 tonnes. 
(6) Actual catches in the 2005 fishing season were 7,855 tonnes, and Japan 
exceeded its quota (6,065 tonnes) by 1,790 tonnes. 
 
5.  Annual scale and distribution of fishing fleet 
 
133 fishing vessels caught SBT in the 2006 fishing season. 
 
6.  Scale and distribution of fishing fleet in the past 
 
(1) In the 1999 fishing season, a total of 227 fishing vessels operated (less 30 
vessels over the 1998 fishing season).  This is because Japan reduced the 
number of tuna long-line fishing vessels in accordance with the Action Plan 
agreed by the FAO. 
(2) In the 2000 fishing season, Japan reduced the number of SBT fishing vessels 
to 172 vessels in accordance with the fishing restrictions based on the 
ITLOS’s provisional measure.  However, as the provisional measure was 
revoked, the fishing quota was increased in September.  Consequently, 27 
vessels were added, and a total of 199 fishing vessels operated SBT fishing. 
(3) In the 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 fishing seasons, the total numbers of 
operating fishing vessels were 227, 224, 221, 222 and 222 respectively. 
 
7.  Monitoring of fishing 
 
Activities to monitor fishing in the 2006 fishing season are as follows: 
 
(1) A new SBT management system was introduced in addition to the existing 
management systems (i.e. dispatch of patrol vessels, VMS monitoring, etc.). 
Under the new system, fishing quotas are allocated for individual 
fisherman/vessel, there is a requirement to tag on each individual SBT caught, 
SBT have to be unloaded at designated ports (all SBT were inspected by 
officers of the Fisheries Agency of Japan), and possession and sales of 
illegally caught SBT are prohibited. 
(2) The Japanese government took necessary measures to manage and monitor 
fishing operations by dispatching patrol vessels to fishing grounds, arranging 
scientific observers on SBT fishing vessels, requesting all SBT fishing vessels 
to install a VMS and requesting SBT fishing vessels to submit a daily report 
on their locations to the Japanese government. 
(3) Three patrol vessels were dispatched to SBT fishing grounds. 
(4) Twelve scientific observers (a total of 13) were dispatched.  Observer 
coverage of Japanese SBT tuna vessels were: 9.8% in the number of fishing 
vessels, 8.8% in the number of hooks and 6.1% in the number of SBT caught.  
The  total cost of these despatched observers was about 43.5 million yen 
(US$395,000). 
 
 
8.  Other factors 
 
Import/export statistics 
The amount of imported SBT in 2006 was 9,701 tonnes (processed weight), less than 
73 tonnes over 2005.  Most of the imports were from CCSBT members (1.  Australia;  
2.  Taiwan;  3.  New Zealand).  In particular, imports from Australia were 8,609 
tonnes, accounting for 88.7% of total import of SBT. 
 
Appendix 1   
 
Japanese New SBT Fishery Regulation 
 
The followings are outline of our new regulation which executed from 1 April 
2006. 
 
� The new regulation introduced an individual SBT quota system for 
individual fishing vessel. Initially 142 vessels were allocated individual 
quota for 2006 fishing season. 
� It includes a tagging system that requires Japanese fishermen to tag each 
individual SBT caught, and the tag must have a serial number and fishing 
vessel’s call sign.  
� It also requires Japanese fishermen to land their SBT at eight designated 
ports only, and all SBT landings will be inspected by governmental-official 
inspectors from the Fisheries Agency. 
� In the new regulation, not only the fishermen, but also companies (i.e. 
buyers and sellers) that knowingly purchase or process illegally caught 
and landed SBT will be considered to have committed a criminal offence 
and will be subject to penalties.  The penalties could be up-to 2-years 
imprisonment and/or up-to five hundred thousand yen fine. 
� In case of serious offenses, the concerned fishermen will be deprived all 
SBT quota for over the next five years.

Review of New Zealand SBT Fisheries 
 
 
 
1.  Introduction 
Since the start of New Zealand’s domestic southern bluefin tuna (SBT) fishery, handline, trolling 
and longline have been used to target SBT in the EEZ. In recent years nearly all of the SBT catch 
has been by surface longline, with occasional small catches by trolling and a small bycatch in the 
mid-water trawl fishery for hoki. The domestic fishery is composed of a wide range of vessel 
types, including many small owner-operated boats and a few large low temperature longliners on 
charter from overseas. 
SBT was introduced into the Quota Management System (QMS) effective 1 October 2004, with a 
Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) of 413 t. The remainder of New Zealand’s TAC of 
420 t is allocated to recreational (four tonnes) and customary fishers (one tonne), and other 
sources of fishing-related mortality (two tonnes). The introduction to the QMS has seen a change 
from the “Olympic” race for fish seen in previous years. This introduction has been associated 
with a consolidation of the SBT longline fleet.  
The most recent fishing season (2005/06) resulted in the lowest NZ catch in 10 years (238 t). This 
is attributed to two main factors: the absence of new recruitment into the NZ longline fishery 
leading to decreased vulnerable biomass (as illustrated in the continued period of low CPUE in 
the charter fleet); and the decline in longline effort from the domestic fleet and charter fleets. 
Initial indications are that catches for 2006/07 are higher (342 t to end of July 2007). 
 
2.  Operational Constraints on Effort 
Legislative  measures 
All New Zealand fishers operating within New Zealand’s SBT fishery or on the high seas must 
hold the relevant domestic or high seas fishing permit and operate from registered fishing vessels.  
Conditions may be attached to the high seas fishing permit to regulate the activity of the vessels, 
including catch reporting and transhipment requirements. All New Zealand flagged vessels 
registered in New Zealand are technically authorised to take SBT, although only a small 
proportion do so. 
New Zealand continues to impose the previously agreed national catch limit for SBT of 420 t 
(whole weight). SBT was introduced into the New Zealand QMS effective 1 October 2004. There 
have been a number of improvements in the management of New Zealand’s SBT fishery as a 
result of the move to QMS management. Three forms of catch reporting for the commercial 
fishery are required (catch and effort, landings, and reports by receivers of fish). Reports of catch 
are balanced  on a monthly basis against quota to improve the monitoring of catches.  Significant 
financial penalties apply to fishers who do not cover their annual catch of SBT with quota, 
thereby limiting the potential for over catch. These domestic catch reporting requirements are in 
addition to CCSBT’s Trade Information Scheme (TIS), which is also in place.  
Another outcome of QMS introduction has been a rationalisation of fishing effort, in conjunction 
with an extension of the fishing season to focus on periods when SBT are in the best possible 
condition for capture.  
 
2
3.  Catch and Effort 
The New Zealand SBT fishery was initially a handline and troll fishery. With the advent of 
domestic longline fishing (starting in 1990), longline effort has almost completely replaced 
trolling and handline fishing effort. Small amounts of SBT continue to be caught by trolling, and 
there is a small SBT bycatch in the mid-water trawl fishery. Total SBT catches are summarised by 
calendar year and fishing year (1 October to 30 September) in Table 1.  
Effort for the charter fleet by calendar year and CCSBT region is provided in Figure 1. Most catch 
and effort occurs in region 6, which covers the west coast of the South Island (WCSI) fishing 
grounds. Over the period 2001-2004 there was no targeting of SBT (and no catches of SBT) by 
the charter fleet in region 5, which covers the east coast North Island (ECNI) fishing grounds. In 
2005, the two charter vessels did fish for SBT in the latter part of the season in region 5, and 
experienced higher catch rates than they had in region 6. 
Longline effort for the domestic fleet by calendar year and region is provided in Figure 2. A 
significant longline fishery operates outside the SBT fishing season, with some bycatch of SBT. It 
is important to separate the domestic and charter data out to better understand the New Zealand 
SBT fishery.  
For catches, the importance of the WCNI and ECNI has varied since 1995. Target effort increased 
dramatically in both regions from 1995 to 2003, but has decreased since then, particularly in 
region 6. 
Nominal CPUE by fleet across all regions (based on targeted longline effort) is provided in 
Figure 3. Charter CPUE averaged around 3 SBT per 1000 hooks from 1997-2002. Associated 
with the lack of new recruitment, CPUE declined dramatically in 2003.  CPUE has stayed at these 
historically low levels until a slight increase in 2006 for the charter fleet. This increase occurred in 
the core area of the charter fishery (region 6), and may be due to the appearance of some small 
recruits. The domestic CPUE has followed a similar pattern over time to the charter CPUE, 
although it is traditionally not as high. 
Recreational and Customary Catches of SBT 
Since 1 October 2004, New Zealand has allowed five tonnes of its national allocation for non-
commercial catches. Due to the locations and seasons during which SBT are now found in New 
Zealand waters (generally winter months, in areas with little recreational fishing), it is unlikely 
this allowance has been approached. 
There have been some reports of bycatch of SBT in the recently developed sport fishery for 
Pacific bluefin (Thunnus orientalis) off the west coast of the South Island. Generally, SBT are 
only taken early in the season (July), with the catch being almost entirely Pacific bluefin during 
August – September, when most of the effort occurs. The overall tonnage of SBT retained is 
thought to be low. Many of the SBT have been tagged and released. 
In order to better estimate the level of recreational catch in relation to the allowance made under 
our national allocation, New Zealand will monitor the Pacific bluefin fishery during the current 
season. 
There are no estimates of SBT catches by Maori non-commercial fishing. Although one tonne of 
the non-commercial allowance is for customary catches, actual take is believed to be negligible.  
 
 
3
4.  Fleet Size and Distribution 
The number of vessels catching SBT peaked in 2002 and has since declined to only 56 vessels in 
2006 (Table 2). In 2005 and 2006 only two charter vessels fished for SBT in New Zealand 
fisheries waters, which is less than recent years. 
The spatial distribution of fishing effort and SBT catches from the charter and domestic fleets are 
provided in Figures 4 and 5.  
New Zealand’s fishing year starts 1 October and finishes 30 September of the following year. 
SBT is seasonally present from March/April to August/September. SBT catches are taken chiefly 
off the WCSI and off the ECNI, from March/April to July.  
Longlining off the WCSI is almost entirely targeted at SBT. The fleet operating off the southwest 
coast is primarily composed of the larger –60º freezer vessels of the charter fleet. The generally 
heavier weather conditions off the WCSI compared to the ECNI means that few of the smaller 
domestic owned and operated vessels operate in this area.  
The longline fishery off the ECNI is dominated by smaller domestically owned and operated “ice 
boats” that are typically at sea for only a few days.  This fishery includes landings of SBT both as 
a target and as a bycatch of bigeye target sets in the Bay of Plenty. 
While most target effort for the domestic fishery occurs off the ECNI, a substantial domestic 
fishery previously operated off the WCSI – mostly due to one large domestic vessel that has not 
fished in recent years. Historically, most of the ECNI effort has been south of East Cape, but after 
the introduction of SBT to the QMS in 2004, the effort was more distributed around the East Cape 
region and occurred slightly later (by a month or so).  
The substantial domestic longline fishery in which SBT is caught in small numbers as a bycatch is 
more northern in its distribution.  This fishery operates outside of the SBT season.  
The distribution of SBT catches is similar to that of target effort, though prior to 2005 
proportionally more catch (compared to effort) was taken in the WCSI fishery compared to the 
ECNI fishery. 
 
5.  Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
The New Zealand SBT fishery began as a winter small boat handline and troll fishery in the early 
1980s. Most fishing by these vessels was in July and August. Since 1990, these methods have 
comprised only a minor component of the fishery, because SBT quota had generally been caught 
by longline vessels by the time the handline fishery started. During the 1980s to mid-1990s most 
longlining was conducted by foreign licensed longliners from Japan. Declining catch rates, 
shortened seasons of availability, and reports of increased operating costs in the EEZ resulted in 
the foreign licensed fleet ceasing operations in 1995. Domestic longlining began in 1991 and 
steadily increased to over 150 vessels in 2002 before declining to the current low of 56 vessels.  
 
6. Fisheries Monitoring and Compliance 
Catch monitoring 
From 1 October 2004, the catch monitoring and catch balancing systems in place for all other NZ 
quota species applied to SBT. All fishers are required to furnish monthly returns of catch.  These 
returns are then matched to individual holdings of quota entitlement.  Financial penalties apply 
(on a monthly basis) to fishers who catch SBT other than under the authority of quota. Fishers 
 
4
have the opportunity to reconcile their catch and quota entitlements up until the end of the fishing 
year, and if they do not do so the financial penalties substantially increase.  
Fish taken commercially may only be sold to licensed receivers of fish. Fish receivers are required 
to furnish monthly returns of their purchases by species and fisher. These reports are used to 
verify individual fishers’ catch returns. 
All exported SBT must be accompanied by a CCSBT-TIS. These are provided to the CCSBT 
Secretariat, who in turn consolidates and reconciles them against NZ reports of catch.  
Observer coverage 
New Zealand has a Scientific Observer Programme that covers both domestic and charter longline 
vessels. All trips on charter vessels are covered by at least one observer. The target coverage level 
for the domestic fleet is 10% of the effort to reflect 10% of the catch.   
In 2005 and 2006, observers were deployed on two charter vessels and nine domestic vessels. 
This involved 10 and 16 observers in 2005 and 2006, respectively. 
Coverage is measured in two ways: proportion of catch (in numbers of fish) observed and 
proportion of hooks observed. Over 98% of the catch was observed (and measured) in the charter 
fleet in 2005 and 2006.  For the domestic fleet, 9% of the catch was observed in 2005, but only 
4% in 2006. In terms of effort, 89% of hooks were observed on the charter vessels in 2005, and 
94% in 2006. For the domestic fleet 12% of the effort was observed in 2005, and 9% in 2006.  
The cost of the observer programme was approximately NZ$219,500 in total (NZ$112,500 for the 
charter coverage, and NZ$107,000 for the domestic coverage).  
Biological information 
Observers from the MFish Scientific Observer Programme are responsible for collecting 
biological data on SBT and bycatch data for catch characterisation. Length, weight (both 
processed and whole weights) and sex are recorded regularly for SBT and all major fish bycatch 
species. 
Observers onboard the charter vessels also collect otoliths from as many SBT caught as possible. 
Due to the smaller size of the domestic vessels and the different processing practices, it is not 
feasible to collect otoliths from the domestic fleet at this time. 
In 2004, 1153 otoliths were collected from SBT, but only 432 and 444 were collected in 2005 and 
2006 respectively. The lower number is because less charter vessels fished in 2005 and 2006. A 
sub-sample of the otoliths from 2004 and 2005 have been aged, although there are currently 
concerns regarding the interpretation of these otoliths. 
Transhipments 
Transhipments by New Zealand flagged vessels, either on the high seas or within New Zealand 
waters, are subject to specific prior approval by the Ministry of Fisheries and must be monitored 
by an observer or Fishery Officer with specific requirements including labelling and the transfer 
of cartons.  Transhipments are not a common occurrence. New Zealand currently has no carrier 
vessels to notify to the Secretariat.  
Vessel Monitoring System 
New Zealand legislation requires: 
 
5
• 
all New Zealand vessels over 28m in length; 
• 
all foreign charter vessels registered to fish in New Zealand waters; 
• 
all New Zealand flagged and registered vessels operating outside of New Zealand waters; 
and 
• 
all vessels issued with a foreign licence to fish in New Zealand waters 
to fit and continuously operate Automatic Location Communicators.  These vessels report to the 
New Zealand VMS.  
The Ministry of Fisheries has recently reviewed the application of VMS to all domestic vessels. 
There are significant technological problems with applying VMS to small vessels at present.  The 
New Zealand Minister of Fisheries has determined that technological solutions will be developed 
over the next two years, with a view to applying VMS to all New Zealand vessels fishing for SBT. 
Since all New Zealand flagged registered vessels are authorised to fish for SBT, the afore-
mentioned group of vessels that fish for SBT with be a subset of all New Zealand vessels 
authorised to do so. 
Resolution on IUU fishing and establishment of CCSBT Vessel record 
New Zealand provides a list of authorised vessels to the CCSBT Secretariat and has put in place 
routine systems to update the record as required.  The list includes all New Zealand flagged and 
registered fishing vessels, all of which are technically authorised to fish for SBT in New Zealand 
fisheries waters.  As of February 2007, applications for vessel registration include a tick box that 
allows applicants to indicate whether or not SBT will be caught by the vessel (either as target or 
bycatch).  Over time, this will allow a specific SBT fleet to be identified (such vessels can 
currently be identified by analysing their previous catch reporting, but this does not allow for new 
vessels entering the fleet to be identified immediately). 
Any catch of SBT is recorded and monitored by routine systems established as part of the New 
Zealand QMS. New Zealand has no information to suggest any of its registered fishing vessels 
have an involvement in IUU fishing.  Procedures have been put in place to ensure foreign owned 
vessels fishing under charter to New Zealand companies may only fish for SBT if they are from a 
member state of the Extended CCSBT. Individual assessments of the compliance history of 
foreign owned vessels are required prior to the approval of their registration as New Zealand 
fishing vessels.  
Implementation of an IUU vessel register and any further consequential changes to the list of New 
Zealand authorised vessels awaits the Commission’s decisions on IUU vessel registers. 
Monitoring and activities undertaken to implement other measures being considered by the 
Compliance Committee will be incorporated in this report in future years once the measures are 
agreed by the Commission.   
 
7. Ecologically related species 
Seabird mitigation measures 
New Zealand implemented its National Plan of Action for Seabirds, in response to the FAO 
International Plan of Action for Seabirds, in April 2004.  The plan is currently being reviewed.  
As of February 2007, New Zealand regulations require surface longline vessels to:  
 
6
• 
use seabird-scaring devices (“tori lines”) when setting surface longlines; 
• 
not set surface longlines between the hours of 0.5 hours before nautical dawn and 0.5 
hours after nautical dusk.1  
• 
provide notice of departure on a fishing trip to the Ministry of Fisheries observer 
programme at least five days prior to sailing. This provision is to aid in placing 
observers on surface longline vessels. 
The minimum standard for tori lines is based on international best practice drawn from CCAMLR, 
CCSBT, and WCPFC recommendations.  
A variety of voluntary practices are employed in the fishery to assist with seabird bycatch 
mitigation, including the use of dyed bait, offal management strategies, and line weighting. The 
charter fleet of large tuna longline vessels sets a voluntary limit on total incidental mortality of “at 
risk” seabirds as part of their code of practice.  
Non-fish bycatch 
New Zealand is in the process of making changes to its reporting requirements, so that fishers can 
more effectively report non-fish bycatch (including turtles, seabirds and marine mammals).  
Changes will also be made to the regulations that cover any interactions with sea turtles (although 
sea turtle bycatch in New Zealand’s pelagic longline fisheries is a very rare occurrence).   
 
8. Other matters 
Import/export statistics 
Statistics on the export of SBT are compiled by Customs and summarized by the Department of 
Statistics. Export statistics are further summarized by the New Zealand Seafood Industry Council 
and maintained as a database for economic evaluations of New Zealand fisheries. CCSBT-TIS 
documents are required for all SBT exports.   
Markets 
The principal market for New Zealand’s SBT fishery is the Japanese sashimi market. Domestic 
consumption is small. 
Historical management 
Prior to the 2004/05 fishing season, the SBT catch limit was a competitive limit among all license 
holders. Regulations specified the annual catch limit and made it an offence to take SBT once the 
catch limit had been reached. The catch limit applied within and outside New Zealand fisheries 
waters for the “fishing year” which extends from 1 October to 30 September. In the few years 
when the catch limit was exceeded, it was reduced in the following year by an equivalent amount. 
Until midway through the 2000/01 fishing season, the SBT quota applied to the catch of both SBT 
(Thunnus maccoyii) and Pacific bluefin tunas (formerly Thunnus thynnus, now recognized as 
                                                 
1 “nautical dawn” means the time at sunrise when the centre of the sun is at a depression angle of 12 degrees 
below the ideal horizon for the place. 
“nautical dusk” means the time at sunset when the centre of the sun is at a depression angle of 12 degrees below 
the ideal horizon for the place 
 
 
7
Thunnus orientalis). The quota restriction on Pacific bluefin tuna was removed late in the 2000/01 
SBT season, when Pacific bluefin tuna was identified as a separate species and it was 
demonstrated morphological characteristics and DNA analysis could be used to readily 
distinguish Pacific bluefin from SBT in catches. SBT landings reported prior to June 2001 
distinguished between northern and southern bluefin even though catches of both were counted 
against the SBT quota. Catches reported as northern bluefin were most likely Pacific bluefin. The 
quota restriction on northern bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) was removed in 2002. 
Pacific bluefin tuna was also introduced into the QMS on 1 October 2004, with a total allowable 
commercial catch of 116 t.

Review of Korean SBT Fishery of 2005/2006 
 
Doo-Hae An, Seon-Jae Hwang, Dae-Yeon Moon, and Soon-Song Kim 
National Fisheries Research and Development Institute, Republic of Korea 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) fishery is the most recently developed tuna fishery by Korean 
distant-water fishing industry. The SBT catch made by Korean longline fleet reached a maximum 
in 1998, followed by continuous decrease until recent years. Species composition of the catch 
shows that target species accounted for 5.6% in 2005 and 48.0% in 2006 of the total catch and 
remaining consisted of tunas, billfishes, sharks and other fish species. Korean longline fleet has 
voluntarily deployed a tori line and other several on-board measures to reduce seabird bycatch 
by longline fishing.  
 
 
2. Review of SBT Fisheries 
 
Fleet size and distribution 
Korean SBT fishery commenced in 1991 with a few longliners shifted from tropical waters 
where they targeted bigeye and yellowfin tuna. Thus, in the early years of this fishery, SBT did 
not attract Korean fishing industry, but because of higher market price number of longliners 
rapidly increased to reach a maximum fleet size of 19 longliners in 1998.  However, by the 
voluntary regulation of fleet size among fishing industries, annual fleet size for SBT fishery 
never exceeded 16 registered number since then and number of longline vessels active was 7 in 
2005 and 9 in 2006. Annual number of fishing vessels for SBT largely depends on Japanese 
market price for SBT and fishing condition on the fishing grounds. 
 
Distribution of catch and effort 
Typically fishing season of Korean SBT longline fishery usually started in March and ends 
by November or December.  In the first half of fishing season from March to July or August, 
usually Korean longliners are fishing on the high seas of the western Indian Ocean off South 
Africa, with occasional expanded operation to the southeastern Atlantic, while in the second half 
they move to the eastern Indian Ocean off the western Australia. This fishing pattern and fishing 
 
2
grounds have rarely been changed for the past 15 years of fishing history for SBT except for 
1991, but in 2005 and 2006, some catches were also taken from the western and central fishing 
grounds from March to September.  
In 2005, 7 out of 16 registered longliners fished for SBT and made a catch of 33 mt (reported 
as processed weight), showing a decrease by about 71% from 2004. In 2006, 9 out of 16 
registered longliners fished for SBT and made a catch of 130 mt.  SBT catches in 2006 by 
Korean longliners were mainly caught from July to December (Table 1) and the fishing was 
formed in the eastern South Africa (Fig 1).  The reason why the Korean fishing ground was 
formed in the area periodically was that the Korean longliners were mainly operated targeting 
the yellowfin and bigeye tunas recently in the Indian Ocean near the South Africa and 
Mozambique. 
Catch per unit effort of Korean longline fishery for SBT has shown a decreasing trend from a 
peak at 8.4 fish/1,000 hooks in 1994. However, CPUE appeared to be more or less stable 
between 2.3 and 4.1 fish/1,000 hooks in recent years. CPUE in 2005 and 2006 were 0.6 
fish/1,000 hooks and 3.1 fish/1,000 hooks, respectively.

3. Fisheries Monitoring for each fleet 
 
3
 
Fisheries statistics are collected and reported for a calendar year. Catch and effort data based 
on the logbooks are routinely collected through a fisheries data collection system which was 
lawful in 1977. According to this domestic regulation, distant-water fishing vessels have to 
submit the reports of their fishing operations within 30 days (home-based) or 60 days (foreign-
based) after completion of their operations to the National Fisheries Research and Development 
Institute (NFRDI). 
Korea initiated a fisheries observer program for distant-water fisheries including tuna 
fisheries in 2002. The purpose of this program is to meet the requirements of relevant regional 
fishery bodies and therefore the mission of trained observers is similar to those set out in the 
convention of the fishery bodies. 
In 2004-2005, two observers were initially deployed on Korean SBT longline fishing vessel 
operating in the EEZ of South Africa and adjacent waters of Mozambique. Scientific observation 
continued for about two months starting from the mid-August 2004 and November 2005.  
During the trip, observers monitored catch of target and by-catch species. In 2006, one observer 
was deployed to monitor tuna longline fishery in the central Indian Ocean, between 5°-8°S and 
49°-55°E. The observer recorded a total catch of 11.6 mt of yellowfin and bigeye tunas during 24 
days of observation period. No SBT catch was reported in the central Indian region. 
 
4. Seabird 
    
According to fishermen, some seabird species (unidentified) are usually encountered as they 
set longlines. However, no documentation on seabird bycatch has been available. During the 
scientific observation trip from August to October in 2006, observer reported that there was no 
incidental catch of seabirds because of several on-board voluntary measures to avoid seabird 
bites such as hook-casting before dawn, tori line installing, using heavy weight and defrozen 
baits, etc. 
 
5. Other Non-target Fish 
 
During the scientific observation of central Indian Ocean in 2006, a total of 21 longline sets 
(one set per day) with total 62,657 hooks were monitored. A total of 21 species (406 in number) 
were observed, among which sharks (46.3%), lancetfish (24.6%), escolar (13.3%), barracuda 
(6.4%) and dolphinfish (4.9%) were dominant. Especially, according to longline fishermen, the 
fishing condition of that year was very bad, but lancetfish as a incidental fish species (exception 
of sharks) was most dominant in number. During hauling the longline sets, about 20% of 
 
4
lancetfish was taken on-board, however 80% of that was dropped in the surface layer. 
Sharks data are usually collected into a “sharks” category because detailed on-board 
identification was difficult to fishermen without a good guide and knowledge in biology. 
According to fishermen’s identification, it seems that blue sharks and mono sharks are dominant 
species among shark bycatch in 2004-2005. However, during the scientific observation trip in 
2006, incidental catches of sharks caught by 62,657 size-4.0 traditional J hooks in central Indian 
Ocean were 188, comprising 12 species. The dominant species were silky shark (51.6% of the 
total catch in number), blue shark (20.7%), white-tip shark (9.0%), smooth hammerhead shark 
(6.4%) and mako shark (4.8%). These species were composed of dominant sharks species and 
mostly taken in surface layer. Overall catch rates of sharks were 3.0 sharks/1,000 hooks in the 
Indian Ocean. The fins comprised, on average, 4.6% in wet weight and 0.53% in dried weight of 
the total body weight in Indian Ocean. So, we could estimate the round weight of certain sharks 
species used for fin production (Table 2).

6. Marine Mammal and Marine Reptiles 
 
No data is available for marine mammals or reptiles incidentally caught by Korean SBT 
longline fishery. During the scientific observation trip in 2006, sighting of whales were not 
recorded and there was no incidental catch of sea turtle.

7. Mitigation Measures  
 
Current Measures 
Mandatory Measures for Each Fleet 
Currently there are no mandatory measures taken by Korean Government to reduce the 
incidental catch of seabird by its tuna longline fishery. However, the Ministry of Maritime 
Affairs and Fisheries (MOMAF) is developing the National Plans of Action for the reduction of 
seabird and shark bycatch from longline fisheries and the preliminary NPOA-seabird and sharks 
is under compilation. It completed the NPOA-IUU fishing and reported to FAO in 2005. 
 
Voluntary Measures for Each Fleet  
While no mandatory measures to reduce seabird bycatch was taken by the Korean 
Government, fishermen voluntarily adopted seabird deterrent device called tori line. Based on 
fishermen’s interview, it was around 1990s when Korean longliners voluntarily began to deploy 
tori line to deter seabirds from baited hooks. Fishermen recognize from their experiences that 
deterring seabirds from contacting baits during SBT longline sets is beneficial not only to reduce 
seabird mortality but to their fishery by reducing bait and effort loss.  
In 2006 and 2007, MOMAF and NFRDI published guidebooks, information booklets and 
posters to educate fisherman through recent information and identification key for bycatch 
species in tuna fisheries. 
 
 
8. Public Relations and Education Activities 
 
To avoid or reduce mortality of seabird and sea turtle by tuna longline vessels, guidebooks, 
information booklets and posters for the information and release manual of these species were 
distributed to fishing boats including tuna longliners in 2006 and 2007. 
NFRDI opens a training session for fishing vessel captains as they make a visit to Korean 
Tuna Longline Fishing Association before they begin their fishing trip. Last year, 8 training 
sessions were taken for fishing captains. The session largely includes reporting of fishing activity, 
target species and implementation of international regulation. However, the importance of 
bycatch reporting is also emphasized and encouraged.  
 
 
9. Other Research Activities 
 
6
 
Comparison of circle hooks and J hooks catch rates for target and bycatch species was 
conducted in the Korean tuna longline fishery in Pacific Ocean in 2005 and 2006. The results of 
circle hooks test were already reported to the Scientific Committee of WCPFC in 2006. In 2007, 
these research activities of circle hooks will be continued by NFRDI from July to September in 
WCPFC convention area.

Guidelines for CCSBT tags 
General requirements of a SBT tagging system 
1. Members and Cooperating Non-Members should require the master or 
operator of each of its vessels, and the owner or operator of its farms, to attach 
a SBT tag to each southern bluefin tuna at the time of kill.  The SBT tag 
should remain on each individual fish while the fish carcass remains whole. (A 
fish remains whole despite cleaning, gilling and gutting, freezing, removing 
fins, gill plates and tail and removing the head or parts of the head.  A fish is 
no longer considered to be whole if it has undergone processes such as 
filleting or loining). 
2. Members and Cooperating Non-Members should take steps to ensure that SBT 
tags cannot be reused. 
3. Members and Cooperating Non-Members should prohibit the unauthorised 
transfer or sale of southern bluefin tuna without a SBT tag. 
4. Members and Cooperating Non-Members should prohibit the unauthorised 
transfer or sale of SBT tags. 
Specifications for SBT tags 
5. Each SBT tag should meet the following requirements: 
a. have a unique pre-recorded tag number, which should be printed on the 
tag in an easily readable form, and, if possible, a machine readable bar 
code; 
b. be able to be securely fastened to southern bluefin tuna; 
c. be non-reusable, tamper-proof and secure from counterfeiting or 
replication; 
d. be able to withstand at least negative sixty (60) degrees Celsius 
temperatures, salt water and rough-handling; and 
e. be food safe. 
Record-keeping, reporting and auditing requirements 
6. Members and Cooperating Non-Members should record the distribution of 
SBT tags to entities authorised to fish for, or farm, southern bluefin tuna. 
7. In relation to each tag, Members and Cooperating Non-Members should have 
systems to record: 
• the tag number; 
• length and weight at time of kill; 
• a record of the details of the catching vessel (e.g. .flag, owner, operator, 
call sign); 
• time and location of catch; and 
• in the case of farm harvest, details of the farm, such as owner and operator. 
8. Members and Cooperating Non-Members should require the master or 
operator of each of its vessels, and the owner or operator of its farms, who are 
issued tags to record the SBT tag numbers attached to southern bluefin tuna in 
logbooks or other reporting format for that purpose, together with the length 
and weight of each fish tagged.  Members and Cooperating Non-Members 
should require that this information be provided to the Member or Cooperating 
Non-Member within 28 days of tagging, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.

Resolution on establishing the CCSBT Vessel Monitoring System 
(as proposed by Japan) 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), 
 
Recalling that, at its thirteenth annual meeting, the Extended Commission Members 
and Cooperating Non-Members agreed to develop and implement their Vessel 
Monitoring Systems (the 2006 VMS resolution); 
 
Recognising the need for monitoring, control and surveillance measures to apply to all 
sectors of the global southern bluefin tuna fishery; 
 
Recognising the importance of these Vessel Monitoring Systems as an integral part of 
an effective monitoring, control and surveillance regime for the southern bluefin tuna 
fishery, in particular to ensure the long-term sustainability of the stock; 
 
Mindful that a vessel monitoring system was identified as one of the  important 
monitoring, control and surveillance measures to deter illegal, unreported and 
unregulated fishing in the Course of Actions adopted at the Kobe Joint Meeting of 
Tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisations from 22 – 26 January 2007; 
 
Recognising the need to stipulate minimum standards for the Vessel Monitoring 
Systems; 
 
Aware that some Members and other regional fisheries management organizations 
have established Vessel Monitoring Systems and that the experiences of such 
Members and organizations may be useful in developing and implementing a 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna Vessel Monitoring 
System; 
 
Agrees, in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8 of the Convention for the

Attachment 12 
Draft Resolution for under and over catch 
Aware that Members and Cooperating Non-Members adopt differing fishing years and apply 
different reporting and management arrangements to ensure their nationals remain within 
each national allocation; 
Noting that southern bluefin tuna are a relatively long lived species and, under normal 
circumstances, small annual variations in catch over and under the national allocations on 
average are unlikely to create a conservation risk for the species; 
Further noting concerns regarding the stock status which suggest that there should be strong 
disincentives against over fishing and particularly persistent over fishing; 
Considering that providing a limited ability for fishers to carry forward under fishing from 
one year to the next reduces the risk that, in attempting to fully catch individual or country 
allocations in a given year, those allocations are over fished; 
Desiring to formalise arrangements for over and under fishing of national southern bluefin 
tuna allocations; 
Agrees to adopt, pursuant to Article 8.3(b) of the Convention for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna, the following procedures for managing fishing above and below 
national allocations: 
Procedure for managing underfishing of national allocation 
1 
A Member or Cooperating Non-Member with a national allocation of up to and 
including 500 tonnes who undercatches its allocation in any one year may carry 
forward that undercatch to the next year, but no other year, by up to a maximum of 
10% of their national allocation. 
2 
A Member or Cooperating Non-Member with a national allocation of more than 500 
tonnes who undercatches its allocation in any one year may carry forward that 
undercatch to the next year, but no other year, by up to a maximum of 5% of their 
national allocation. 
3 
If the national allocation of a Member of Cooperating Non-Member is decreased 
pursuant to Article 8.3(a) of the Convention, no undercatch from the preceding year 
may be carried over. 
3 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members may apply these provisions to individual 
allocations (vessel or quota owner) within their national allocations or to their national 
allocation alone. 
Procedure for managing overfishing of national allocation 
4 
A Member or Cooperating Non-Member who overfishes its allocation in any year, 
taking into account any undercatch being utilised relating to the previous year, shall 
deduct the total of that overcatch from its national allocationpay back the 
overcatchwithin  the following two years, or additional consecutive years when the 
 
 
 
overcatch and any penalty accrued pursuant to articles 5 and 6 below exceeds the total 
national allocation of the Member of Cooperating Non-Member over those two years. 
5 
A Member or Cooperating Non-Member with a national allocation of up to and 
including 500 tonnes shall, in addition to the amount of the overcatch, deduct from its 
national allocation  pay back an additional amount of allocationof overcatch aas a 
penalty amount in accordance with the second column of table 1 below. 
6 
A Member or Cooperating Non-Member with a national allocation of more than 500 
tonnes shall, in addition to the amount of the overcatch, deduct from its national 
allocationpay back an additional amount of allocation of overcatch as a  penalty 
amount in accordance with the third column of table 1 below. 
7 
The deduction of a penalty amount of allocation pursuant to Articles 5 and 6 above 
shall occur over the two years following the overcatch.  If the total of overcatch 
deduction or penalty deduction or both exceeds the national allocation for those two 
years then it may be deducted from the national allocation over additional consecutive 
years until fully accounted for.

Satisfactory application of these provisions to examples of overcatch by Members and 
Non-Cooperating Members shall be considered as evidence of compliance with the 
commitments of the CCSBT for the purpose of evaluating possible IUU fishing.These 
procedures shall be reviewed by the Compliance Committee in 2010, and any 
recommendations for amendments forwarded to the Commission for consideration.
