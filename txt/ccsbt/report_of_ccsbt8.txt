Report of the Eighth Annual Meeting of the Commission 
15 – 18 October 2001  
Miyako, Japan 
 
 
Agenda Item 1. 
 Opening of the Meeting 
 
Agenda Item 1.1.  
Welcoming address 
 
1. Mr Watanabe (Director General of the Fisheries Agency of Japan) and Mr Suzuki 
(Member of the House of Parliament), addressed the meeting and welcomed 
participants to Japan and to Miyako. 
 
Agenda Item 1.2.  
Adoption of the Agenda 
 
2. The Agenda was adopted as circulated in Attachment A. 
 
3. The list of meeting participants is included at Attachment B. 
 
4. The list of documents tabled at the meeting is included at Attachment C. 
 
Agenda Item 1.3.  
Opening Statements 
 
 
Agenda Item 1.3.1. 
Members 
 
5. Opening statements by members are included at Attachment D.  In their opening 
statements, members identified the priority issues for consideration at the meeting. 
 
Agenda Item 1.3.2. 
Other States and Entities 
 
6. The Republic of Korea and Taiwan gave opening statements, which are included at 
Attachments D and E.  In its opening address, Korea advised that its accession to 
CCSBT was imminent and requested the right to participate fully at CCSBT8 and 
have its opinions recognised as if it were a member. 
 
 
Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
 
7. Mr Brian Macdonald, the Executive Secretary of the CCSBT submitted document 
CCSBT/0110/04, which is a report on the activities of the Secretariat since the 
Seventh Annual meeting in April 2001.  
 
8. The Executive Secretary also presented observations on the operation of the 
Commission and how operations could be improved to make the Commission more 
effective and gave recommendations for an enhanced role for the Secretariat.  
  
9. The members endorsed the general thrust of a more active role for the Secretariat. 
 
  
2
Agenda Item 3. 
Accession of Korea 
 
10. The Korean delegation initially advised the Commission that accession was 
approved by its government in September and was waiting for formal signing by its 
Prime Minister and President.  The instrument of accession would be deposited by 
the end of October and Korea was ready to make its financial contribution when the 
bill came from the Secretariat.  Korea re-iterated its wish to participate fully in the 
meeting given this commitment. 
 
11. On 17 October 2001, Korea advised the Commission that it had finished all 
domestic procedures to join the CCSBT and that the instrument of accession had 
been lodged with the Australian Government.  Following confirmation of 
lodgement, Korea was welcomed and participated as a full member of the CCSBT. 
 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Relationship with Non-members 
 
Agenda Item 4.1            Taiwan 
 
12. Taiwan made a statement to the Commission on its intention to cooperate with the 
CCSBT in the management and conservation of the SBT fishery and this is recorded 
at Attachment F.  In response, the Executive Secretary on behalf of the Chair made 
the following statement on behalf of the Commission: 
 
“The Commission welcomes Taiwan’s acceptance of an annual Southern Bluefin 
Tuna (SBT) catch quota of 1140 tonnes and confirms that this shall form the 
basis for its participation as a Member of the Extended Commission, subject to 
the following conditions: 
 
1. 
Taiwan should lodge a formal application for Membership of the 
Extended Commission by an Exchange of Letters as provided for in 
Paragraph 6 of the Resolution to Establish an Extended Commission and 
Extended Scientific Committee (as passed by the Commission in April 
2001) by 31 December 2001.  The Commission will correspond with 
Taiwan shortly to initiate this process. 
 
2. 
Taiwan undertakes immediately to voluntarily restrict its annual catch of 
SBT to a maximum of 1140 tonnes pending the completion of its 
domestic legal processes required to give effect to its membership of the 
Extended Commission. 
 
The Commission will take action to identify Taiwan pursuant to Paragraph 2 of 
the Action Plan as a non-member the vessels of which have been catching SBT 
in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of conservation and management 
measures for SBT if the above conditions are not met.  It may also consider, 
thereafter, taking additional measures pursuant to Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the 
Action Plan, which may include imposing trade-restrictive measures which avoid 
arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade. 
 
  
3
  
The Commission also welcomes Taiwan’s undertaking not to issue Trade 
Information Scheme documentation for any fresh SBT caught in the SBT 
spawning grounds and to support measures to combat Flag of Convenience 
fishing activities and other voluntary measures stated by Taiwan.  The 
Commission looks forward to cooperating with Taiwan with regard to these 
matters. 
 
The Commission looks forward to Taiwan’s early and full participation in the 
work under the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, as a 
Member of the Extended Commission, entitled to enjoy the same rights and 
obligations with other Members of the Extended Commission, at the earliest 
possible date.” 
 
13. In reply, Taiwan stated the following: 
 
“Taiwan has been cooperating with the CCSBT for a long time. As all Members 
of CCSBT are aware, Taiwan has traditionally cooperated with the CCSBT. As 
far as the issue of Taiwan’s accession to the Convention is concerned, we have 
continued on negotiating this issue and substantial progress has been made 
during this meeting. After the completion of negotiation, all domestic legal 
procedures will also be initiated immediately. We also hope that those domestic 
legal procedures can be completed as soon as possible.  As a matter of fact, 
Taiwan is the most cooperative non-member. Under such circumstances, after all 
those concessions we have made, it would be unreasonable to resort to Action 
Plan against such a cooperative non-member. We are deeply disappointed to see 
such a result.” 
 
Agenda Item 4.2.            Indonesia 
 
14. Options were considered by the meeting for obtaining improved cooperation from 
Indonesia.  In particular, all parties agreed that it was important for Indonesia to 
accede to CCSBT and that pressure should be applied by the CCSBT as soon as 
practicable to do so. 
 
15. The meeting supported Australia’s bilateral activity with Indonesia in respect of 
both its discussions with Indonesia and its data collection initiatives. 
 
16. Indonesia needs to be encouraged to improve its data collection and provision 
systems.  Japan pointed out that TIS data received from Indonesia has been quite 
poor and there was considerable missing information. 
 
17. Australia noted its concern on the impact on the stock from fishing pressure on the 
spawning ground by Indonesian fishing vessels owned by Taiwanese companies and 
was consequently concerned that the Commission could not afford to delay 
resolving the situation. 
 
 
  
4
18. It was agreed that a small group would be convened to work inter-sessionally to 
develop options for a plan to secure Indonesia’s accession and improve data 
provision.  While it was agreed that Australia would act on behalf of CCSBT as the 
main point of contact with Indonesia, Australia suggested that it might also be 
effective for Australia and Japan to approach Indonesia jointly. 
 
Agenda Item 4.3.           South Africa 
 
19. The Executive Secretary advised that South Africa had been invited to participate as 
an observer and a South African embassy official was hoping to be present for the 
last day of the meeting.  
 
20. It was noted that South Africa has often said that it was interested in joining 
CCSBT, but to date, no positive action has been taken in this respect.  It was further 
noted that South Africa had indicated that it would be seeking an allocation of 250t.  
Japan pointed out that the issue of allocation was a completely separate matter from 
accession and that the two should be considered separately.  It was noted that a State 
could accede with no initial quota allocation. 
 
21. The Executive Secretary was asked to convey these views to South Africa. 
 
Agenda Item 4.4.          Others 
 
22. Australia was concerned about possible new SBT fishing activity from China.  
There appeared to be movement of 60 Taiwanese longliners from Taiwan to China 
and nearly 4 tonne of SBT was recorded as being exported from China to Japan. 
 
23. Japan shared the concern about the 60 Chinese longliners, but explained that the 
apparent SBT exports from China were probably mislabelled “re-exports” from 
Japanese processors based in China.  Japan indicated it would be having bilateral 
discussions with China in the near future on fishing issues and would raise CCSBT 
concerns and report back to the CCSBT9. 
 
24. It was agreed to consider other countries under the Action Plan agenda item.  Japan 
stressed that further action should be taken against the four countries identified in 
accordance with paragraph 2 of the Action Plan adopted at CCSBT6(2). 
 
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Action Plan 
 
Agenda Item 5.1.           Report on identified nations 
 
25. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT/0110/07 concerning the Action 
Plan. 
 
26. The meeting agreed that there was value in preparing a list of IUU vessels and that 
the TIS would be used to assist in this respect.  The list would enable action to be 
 
  
5
targeted to specific vessels involved in IUU fishing rather than only country specific 
action. 
 
27. Japan offered to prepare a list of IUU vessels catching SBT and present it to 
CCSBT9 for further examination and consideration by the Commission.  
 
28. The Executive Secretary was asked to modify the table provided in 
CCSBT/0110/07 for CCSBT9.  The modified table should include an additional 
column that provides the current status of countries so that progress by countries 
could be assessed. 
 
Agenda Item 5.2.           Others 
 
29. The Commission agreed to new measures regarding non members pursuant to the 
action plan.  The relevant decisions of the Commission are set out at Attachments 
G, H and I. 
 
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
30. It was agreed that a Finance and Administration Committee would be formed and 
run in parallel to the plenary session.  Mr Mae (Japan) and Mr Hausknecht 
(Australia) were appointed as co-chairs for the Committee. 
 
Agenda Item 6.1.           Adoption of the revised 2001 budget 
 
31. The Commission endorsed the revised budget for 2001 as outlined in the Finance 
and Administration Committee report at Attachment J. 
 
Agenda Item 6.2.           Adoption of the 2002 budget 
 
32. The Commission endorsed the proposed budget for 2002 as outlined in the Finance 
and Administration Committee report. 
 
Agenda Item 6.3.           Others 
 
33. The Commission thanked the Finance and Administration Committee for its efforts 
and good work in developing the revised budget for 2001 and the budget for 2002. 
 
 
Agenda Item 7.  
Review of SBT fisheries 
 
34. Reports on the CCSBT fisheries of members, as well as reports from non-members 
who were present are included at Attachment K. 
 
35. Considerable discussion, including matters of clarification, were held after the 
reports.  The following paragraphs identify the most significant points that were 
raised during these discussions. 
 
  
6
 
36. Australia presented a paper (CCSBT/0110/26) that had been requested at CCSBT7 
on the growth rates of SBT held in farms.  It was noted that weight increases in the 
order of 93% were being obtained from farming SBT and further increases could be 
expected as techniques improved.  Japan tentatively replied that it will make 
comments after reviewing the paper. 
 
37. In the light of Japanese concerns over health and safety of the consumption of fish 
products, Japan advised that it would be desirable if Australia could formally declare 
that meat and bone meal products are not used on Australian tuna farms.  
 
38. Members expressed concern that the Taiwanese catch had increased in recent years.  
Taiwan advised that it has managed its TAC on a 5 year average catch of 1450t and 
was adhering to this level.  Taiwan said it would introduce yearly catch managing 
system to replace the 5 year averaging. 
 
39. Significant concerns were raised over the large fleet (over 500 small longliners) of 
Taiwanese owned vessels that are fishing the spawning grounds of SBT in 
Indonesian waters.  Taiwan explained that these vessels are flagged as Indonesian 
vessels and that they operate under Indonesian licenses.  Taiwan advised that it has 
no jurisdiction over these vessels under international law and the catch from these 
vessels should be considered to be Indonesian catch. 
 
 
Agenda item 8. 
Report from the Scientific Committee and the Tagging 
Program Workshop 
 
40. The Chair of the Scientific Committee (Mr Penney) introduced the reports of the 6th 
Meeting of the Scientific Committee (Attachment L) and the Tagging Program 
Workshop (Attachment M).  He focused on the most important issues in the 
reports, particularly where a decision was required from the Commission or where 
there was a budgetary implication. 
 
Agenda Item 8.1  
Status of the SBT stock 
 
41. Mr Penney led the meeting through Sections 5.1 (Status of the SBT stock) and 5.2 
(Implications for SBT Management) of the Scientific Committee (SC) Report. 
 
42. Follow-up questions were asked in relation to: 
－The level of monitoring required to allow CCSBT to react to stock problems in  
 sufficient time to prevent a stock collapse. 
－The current replacement yield for SBT. 
－When an assessment with greater certainty would be available. 
－Whether an assessment had been conducted to determine the harvest level 
 required to achieve a rebuilding of the spawning stock to 1980 levels by 2020. 
 
43. In answer to these questions, Mr Penney advised: 
 
  
7
－The SRP included a wide range of initiatives, including improved catch 
reporting, improved modelling and improved length frequency sampling 
especially for non-members.  In particular, a set of indicators has been proposed 
to give the CCSBT a clear idea of whether the stock is increasing or decreasing. 
－Estimates of the current replacement yield are uncertain.  However, the 2000 
catch level appears to be roughly close to the current replacement yield with a 
50% chance that the stock could either decrease or increase at this harvest level. 
－The development of a new suite of operational and assessment models as part of 
the management strategy development process should produce assessments with 
a higher level of certainty.  This is targeted for 2003 (or 2004 if there are delays). 
－As a result of the uncertainty in assessments, no specific effort was made to 
assess the harvest level required to achieve the CCSBT’s management goal of a 
1980 level of spawning stock by 2020.  This was largely because the current 
models would have produced too broad a range of results to be of use for 
decision-making.  However, most of the assessment results indicated a low 
probability of attaining this target at current catch levels. 
 
Agenda Item 8.2  
Scientific Research Program 
 
44. Mr Penney stated that substantial progress had been made on all 4 components of 
the SRP.  He then led the meeting through progress in the 4 components of the SRP, 
as documented in section 6.1 (Implementation of the SRP) of the SC Report. 
 
Agenda Item 8.2.1. 
Catch and effort data collection including 
coordinating data into the database 
 
45. The progress in this item is described in section 6.1.1. (Characterization of SBT 
Catch) of the SC Report. 
 
46. Discussion was held regarding the spatial resolution of data to be provided to the 
CCSBT database.  It was noted that no agreement has been reached on the level of 
resolution of data that should be provided to the CCSBT.  New Zealand noted that 
discussion at the Scientific Committee included issues such as whether to submit 
data for current assessment requirements (which do not require high resolution), or 
to submit data at a higher resolution in case this is required in the future.  New 
Zealand also noted the need to have agreed confidentiality and security procedures 
in place before submitting data. 
 
47. Japan voiced its concerns about insufficient data provision from Australia’s purse 
seine fishery, which takes about 33% of the world catch of SBT.  In Japan’s view 
that it was difficult to use these data for stock assessment purposes.  Australia re-
iterated its undertaking to provide the data in an appropriate format.  Australia 
further advised that it was willing to provide any data that was required for stock 
assessment purposes and expected that others would reciprocate with a similar 
approach.  Japan also requested Australia to provide catch data for SBT sport fishing 
and for by-catches of SBT by some fisheries that do not have SBT quota.  
 
 
  
8
Agenda Item 8.2.2. 
Scientific observer program 
 
48. The progress in this item is described in section 6.1.3. (Development of a Scientific 
Observer Program) of the SC Report. 
 
49. In particular, following a review of information on past and existing observer 
programs, a draft proposal for the main components of a CCSBT Observer Program 
had been developed. 
 
50. In addition to the specified work plan for development of the standard for the 
Scientific Observer Program, the Secretariat was asked to prepare a review of the 
current observer programs that identifies the extent to which those existing programs 
are meeting the requirements of the draft standard CCSBT observer program 
proposal.  New Zealand also requested the Secretariat to obtain information on the 
spatial and temporal level of observer deployment of existing observer programs. 
 
51. Japan expressed its concern about the lack of an observer program for Australian 
domestic fisheries, including purse seine fisheries.  It requested Australia to 
immediately introduce an observer program for its domestic fisheries.  Australia 
advised that it was in discussion with industry over implementation of an observer 
program in the 2002 fishing year. 
 
52. Japan noted that member countries will be responsible for operation of observers in 
high seas and domestic EEZ fisheries on their flag vessls. CCSBT standards for data 
collection and training should be simple and minimal, requiring a practical level of 
observer coverage with 10% as a target. 
 
Agenda Item 8.2.3 
Tagging program 
 
53. A Workshop was held in Canberra on 2-4 October 2001 to develop a CCSBT 
tagging program.  Mr Penney led the meeting through the Report of the Tagging 
Program Workshop. 
 
54. Japan stated that the expected mortalities (15t for surface fishery tagging and 50t for 
longline tagging) from the tagging program should be attributed against the research 
quota allocated to the SRP.  There were no objections to this proposal. 
 
55. In relation to concerns about the high cost of the program, questions were raised 
regarding the priority aspects of the program.  In brief, Mr Penney advised: 
－The most important component is the annual tagging of 10,000 to 15,000 juvenile 
SBT in the surface fishery off the South and South West coast of Australia, using 
a pole and line vessel. 
－Tagging of larger SBT using longline vessels is a one-year pilot study that will 
need to be fully evaluated once the results are available. 
 
56. Considerable discussion was held concerning the allocation of costs to support the 
tagging program amongst CCSBT members.  Members discussed apportioning of 
 
  
9
those costs and what costs would be formally considered as pooled CCSBT costs 
and what costs would be separately covered by the respective members. 
 
57. It was later agreed that the tagging would be conducted under the auspices of the 
CCSBT, with tagging in the surface fishery being the highest priority.  Tagging SBT 
in the longline fishery would be done as a pilot program.  Australia offered to fund 
the surface fishery tagging for the first year.  Australia and Japan proposed funding 
two longline tagging components of the CCSBT tagging program.  A  
New Zealand longline component was not included for budgetary reasons.  
Coordination of the tagging program and the tag recoveries in Cape Town and 
Mauritius would be covered under the 2002 CCSBT budget. 
 
58. Korea understood that the expenses for tagging projects were separate from the 
Commission’s annual operating budget.  However, considering the minor proportion 
of the coordination and the recovery costs of the tagging program against the total 
Commission’s budget, Korea agreed that the budget for the coordination and the 
recovery can be covered by the Commission’s budget.  But Korea re-iterated its 
position that the substantial and operational expenses for the specific components of 
the tagging program should be financed by the relevant members which conduct the 
program. 
 
Agenda Item 8.2.4. 
CPUE modelling procedures 
 
 
59. The progress in this item is described in section 6.1.2. (CPUE Interpretation and 
Analysis) of the SC Report. 
 
60. Japan commented that CPUE modelling effort should concentrate on major 
uncertainties rather than examining the impacts of very detailed factors such as 
capability of fishing masters.  Japan suggested that the CCSBT should advise the 
Scientific Committee on this matter. 
 
Agenda Item 8.3  
Management Procedure 
 
61. Mr Penney led the meeting through section 6.2 (Management Procedure and 
Management Strategy Evaluation) of the SC Report. 
 
62. Members generally agreed with the direction of the work plan and felt that this was 
the highest priority work within the SRP.   
 
63. In response to a question on appointment of a suitable coordinator, Mr Penney 
advised that he believed that Dr Ana Parma would be one of the best people for this 
role.  The meeting agreed with the choice of Dr Parma as the preferred coordinator. 
 
64. There was a strong desire for the work to be completed as soon as possible.  This 
was both to minimise costs and to have the results from the work available as soon 
as possible.  It was acknowledged that the time required to complete the work was 
dependent on member scientists being able to provide both significant and timely 
 
  
10
input to requests from the coordinator and the consultant engaged on this work.  
Members agreed that it was important to respond in a timely manner. 
 
65. The Executive Secretary was asked to liaise with the Advisory Panel to determine 
the appointment of a suitable consultant for developing the computer code, the 
documentation and conducting preliminary trials.  The Executive Secretary advised 
that a suitable consultant had been identified by the Advisory Panel. 
 
Agenda Item 8.4  
Other Research Requirements 
 
66. Mr Penney briefed the meeting on the section 7 (SBT Research Requirements) of 
the SC Report.  In particular, Mr Penney described the recommended assessment 
approach for future SAG meetings (especially 2002, and 2003), the proposed 
workshop on direct age estimation, and the overview of the time schedule and 
budgetary implications for the 2001/2002 research activities. 
 
67. The meeting agreed with the recommended assessment approach described in 
section 7.1 of the SC report for 2002. 
 
68. As with previous items, members again expressed the need to minimise funding 
while maximising the returns. 
 
69. It was agreed that the emergency SAG (if required) should be scheduled to occur 
back to back with the SC meeting.   
 
 
Agenda item 9. 
Total Allowable Catch and its Allocation 
 
Agenda Item 9.1  
Total Allowable Catch 
 
70. The parties presented overviews of their respective positions on a Total Allowable 
Catch. 
 
71. New Zealand indicated that its position is based on two principles.  The first of 
these is the Commission’s management objective to rebuild the SBT stock to 1980 
levels by 2020, which is consistent with UNCLOS obligation to maintain and restore 
the population of harvested species at levels that can produce maximum sustainable 
yield.  The second principle was to act consistently with the recommendation of the 
SC report and to adopt as a maximum, a TAC based on current catch levels. 
 
 
 
 
72. Japan proposed that current catch levels should be defined as the average from 1994 
to 2000, providing a provisional global TAC of 16,000 tonnes and the CCSBT 
should manage to this level. 
 
 
  
11
73. Australia indicated its view that the CCSBT should manage to a global catch limit 
of 15,579 tonnes, which would include the total allowable catch of CCSBT members 
and the catch of non members and that allocations of catch to members should 
remain at their current levels. 
 
74. Korea advised that it respects the recommendation of the Scientific Committee 
regarding the total allowable catch. 
 
75. Considering all aspects of the SC report, members supported a provisional global 
catch limit based on current catch levels together with a plan to have a quick 
response in the event that there is a negative change in the status of the stock 
 
76. Members agreed that non-members catches had to be restrained and preferably 
reduced. 
 
77. Australia noted the uncertainty surrounding the current status of the stock and the 
significant increase in non-party catch since 1988.  The need to constrain any 
increase in global catch was noted. 
 
Agenda Item 9.2  
National Allocation 
 
78. New Zealand proposed that members develop a process for monitoring and 
reviewing engagement with non-members with a view to ensuring that the principles 
of national allocation reflected in Article 8 of the Convention are adhered to.  New 
Zealand also noted that members’ understanding on future adjustments was set out 
in CCSBT1 and there is a need to ensure that current and future Commission 
members accept the understanding. 
 
79. Japan believed that the three long standing member countries have shown restraint 
for many years and that they should be entitled to more than their current catch level 
in recognition of their restraint. 
 
80. Korea reiterated that it would maintain its catch at its agreed catch level with 
CCSBT. 
 
81. Following further deliberation, the members could not reach consensus on national 
allocations and provided statements on their positions in regard to this issue.  These 
statements are at Attachment N. 
 
 
 
 
Agenda item 10. 
Other management measures 
 
82. Australia raised its concern with the level of fishing being undertaken in the 
spawning grounds within Indonesian waters.  Australia believed that better 
information was needed on the level of activity that is being conducted and to 
establish whether Indonesia is being used as a flag of convenience.  A suitable 
 
  
12
course of action needs to be established and a dual Australia/Japanese approach to 
Indonesia might be useful in highlighting the seriousness of the issue. 
 
83. Japan agreed and further stated that these activities were a threat to the stock and 
that information on the magnitude of the situation and protection of the spawning 
grounds needed to be achieved as soon as possible. 
 
84. Australia volunteered to take the lead with regards to discussion with Indonesia and 
the meeting supported this.  Japan added that Indonesia also needed to be advised of 
CCSBT’s concern over the lack of information on the capture of SBT in the 
spawning grounds in the Indonesian EEZ. 
 
 
Agenda item 11. 
Trade Information Scheme (TIS) application and operation 
 
85. Japan advised the meeting of problems that it was experiencing with the completion 
of TIS documents.  This included significant quantities of missing information from 
Indonesia and some mistakes from Taiwan and New Zealand in their identification 
of southern bluefin tuna and bluefin tuna.  Japan requested that Australia provide 
further advice to Indonesia on completing the TIS and requested that New Zealand 
introduce a government validation system by the end of 2001.  Japan also requested 
that Taiwan improve its validation system because Japan found that some SBT was 
exported from Taiwan as northern bluefin tuna.  It was noted that NZ has reviewed 
their implementation of the TIS scheme and is introducing a number of 
improvements, including a move to government validators 
 
86. New Zealand advised that it considers the TIS to be most valuable for reducing IUU 
fishing activities and for the collection of catch information from non-members.  
New Zealand has reviewed the operation of its TIS system, and as a consequence, 
the validation system will be revised and the form being used will be changed to 
allow multi-vessel shipment reporting similar to the form used by Australia.  Once 
finalised, the form will be circulated to members and to the Executive Secretary in 
accordance with item 4.1 of the Statistical Document Program.  
 
87. New Zealand requested that the Secretariat review the TIS scheme and that the 
review should assess how well the scheme is meeting the objectives that have been 
set, including the accuracy and the value of the data.  The review should identify 
weaknesses of the system and make recommendations on how the system could be 
improved, including making reference to TIS schemes operated by other RFMO’s.  
The review should be completed in 12 months and be reported to CCSBT9. 
 
88. Australia agreed to the Secretariat undertaking a review.  However, Japan noted that 
it was most important to first ensure that the current scheme is being implemented 
correctly according to the CCSBT Statistical Document Program. 
 
89. The Deputy Executive Secretary referred the meeting to paper CCSBT/0110/14 and 
led the meeting through this paper, which is a report on the TIS scheme from the 
Secretariat. 
 
  
13
 
90. Some of the results from the TIS were of concern to the meeting.  In particular, the 
SBT catch from the Philippines and the Seychelles, which were believed to be 
Taiwanese vessels operating under flags of convenience.   
 
91. The meeting expressed considerable concern regarding the Taiwanese vessels 
catching SBT under flags of convenience and Taiwan’s apparent inability to exert 
any control over these vessels, or to provide information concerning the number of 
vessels, or the flags that they flew.  Japan proposed that it develop and circulate a 
list of flag of convenience vessels to discourage this activity (see agenda item 5.1).  
Japan further suggested that Taiwan consider implemented regulations similar to that 
of Japan that makes it illegal for Japanese citizens to target SBT using a flag of 
convenience vessel. 
 
92. Taiwan advised that Taiwan and Japan have implemented a joint action plan to 
reduce the use of flag of convenience. 
  
93. The Chair requested that the Taiwanese delegates convey the substance of this 
discussion to its relevant authorities. 
 
 
Agenda item 12. 
Research Mortality Allowance (RMA) 
 
94. Japan advised that it had only used 0.5t of the 3.6t RMA approved by the 
Commission that was allocated to its research program last year.  
 
95. Japan requested that the CCSBT grant a 3.6t RMA for Japan’s spawning stock 
survey and acoustic survey for the 2001/02 season and also requested Australia to 
provide a permit for these surveys to be conducted in the Australian zone.   
 
96. The Australian delegate advised that he believed that the permit had been approved.   
 
97. All members agreed to the 3.6t RMA requested by Japan. 
 
 
Agenda item 13. 
Program of work 2002 
 
98. The Executive Secretary presented the program of work described in paper 
CCSBT/0110/09 and indicated that figures in this paper have been revised 
downwards since discussions held within the Finance and Administration 
Committee.  The budget and work plan described in the paper assume full 
implementation of the SRP as presented at this meeting, with the exception of the 
tagging program. 
  
99. All members were concerned with the costs and were keen to see the costs 
minimised.  Suggestions included holding all meetings in Australia, prioritising and 
deferring some components of the SRP, reducing costs of aspects of the SRP (e.g. 
 
  
14
reducing the budget associated with tag program coordination and tag recovery), 
minimising attendance of Secretariat staff at meetings. 
 
100. It was agreed that a small group would discuss the tagging program and how costs 
would be handled for that program. The outcome of the working group’s 
deliberations is included at Annex 5 in the report of the Finance and Administration 
Committee. 
 
101. The meeting endorsed a work program and a meeting schedule for the Commission 
as set out in Attachments O and P. 
 
 
Agenda item 14. 
Relationship with other organisations 
 
Agenda Item 14.1 
The FAO Coordinating Working Party on Fishery 
Statistics 
102. The Executive Secretary presented a paper for this item (CCSBT/0110/17).  
Discussion focused on the development of the Fisheries Global Information System 
(FIGIS) and the Fisheries Resource Monitoring System (FIRMS) by FAO.  
Members agreed in principle to cooperating with FAO on these systems, but, as 
there is likely to be budgetary implications as well as implications on CCSBT’s 
duties and priorities, the Commission must see a draft of the MOU from FAO before 
any firm decisions could be made.   
 
Agenda Item 14.2 
The meetings of relevant fisheries management 
organisations 
 
103. The Executive Secretary presented a paper for this item (CCSBT/0110/18).  The 
Commission considered the 2001 proposals and agreed to defer the 2002 proposals 
until the consideration of the 2002 budget. 
 
104. For the remainder of 2001, it was agreed that attendance at the IOTC was most 
important.  If representation at CCAMLR is necessary, one of the members 
attending CCAMLR could represent CCSBT.  Australia volunteered to represent the 
CCSBT at the October CCAMLR meeting and members agreed to this. 
 
105. It was agreed that the Database Manager’s involvement with other agencies would 
be considered in the context of the work plan for 2002 to be considered at agenda 
item 13. 
 
Agenda Item 14.3 
Relevant organisations and international instruments 
 
106. The Executive Secretary presented discussion paper CCSBT/0110/19 and 
recommended that the Commission adopt option 2 from that paper, to “focus on the 
current priorities which are operationalising the Convention in a way that improves 
consistency with international instruments and review CCSBT position at the end of 
2003”. 
 
 
  
15
107. The meeting agreed with the Executive Secretary’s recommendation. 
 
Agenda Item 14.4 
IGO’s attendance at the Scientific Committee meetings 
 
108. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT/0110/20 in relation to this 
matter. 
 
109. The meeting agreed to a modification of the more simple arrangement proposed in 
that paper.  The agreed arrangement is now: 
 
“The Executive Secretary may invite an appropriately skilled scientific 
observer from ICCAT, IOTC and IATTC to attend meetings of the SAG and 
SC.  The observers may be asked, at the discretion of the Chair, to contribute to 
the deliberations of the meeting.” 
 
110. The meeting also requested the Database Manager to liaise with IOTC regarding 
exchange of relevant data (such as IOTC port sampling) between IOTC and CCSBT.  
 
 
Agenda item 15. 
Other business 
 
Agenda Item 15.1 
Confidentiality of Commission Documents 
 
111. The meeting agreed that all documents produced for CCSBT8, including reports of 
the 2nd SAG, 6th SC, Tagging Program Workshop and other intercessional meetings 
could be made publicly available. 
 
112. It was also agreed that a principle would apply whereby permission from the 
author of scientific documents would be sought before citing such work.  It should 
be noted that these documents are normally prepared as background documents for 
technical meetings and are not normally part of the reports produced for the CCSBT. 
 
Agenda Item 15.2 
Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
 
113. The next meeting of the Ecologically Related Species Working Group (ERSWG) 
will be held in the Mita Center, Tokyo, from 26-28 November 2001.  A small group 
met to discuss preparations for the ERSWG meeting.  Further organisation for the 
meeting will be conducted in conjunction with participants and the Secretariat.  It 
was noted that the draft agenda for the meeting had been agreed at CCSBT7. 
 
Agenda Item 15.3 
Other 
 
114. Japan pointed out that page 9 of document CCSBT-SC/0108/15, submitted by an 
Australian scientist contained an error in the description of observer coverage.  The 
document states that “within the SRP a minimum of 10% observer coverage has 
already been agreed for improving and validating the basic catch and effort data”.  
However, the SRP actually states that “The SC recommends an observer coverage of 
 
  
16
10% for catch and effort monitoring as a target level”.  Japan requested that the 
correction be noted. 
 
 
Agenda item 16. 
Close of the meeting 
 
Agenda Item 16.1 
Election of Chair and Vice Chair for CCSBT9 
 
115. CCSBT9 will be hosted and chaired by Australia.  Australia nominated Mr Daryl 
Quinlivan to be the Chair. 
 
116. New Zealand will be the Vice Chair. 
 
Agenda Item 16.2 
Adoption of Report of Meeting 
 
117. The meeting adopted the report.  
 
Agenda Item 16.3 
Closure of the meeting 
 
118.  The Commission thanked the city of Miyako, Iwate Prefecture, the Japanese tuna 
industry and the Government of Japan for their hospitality and support for the 
meeting.  The Commission also thanked the Chair of CCSBT8, the Chair of the 
Scientific Committee, the interpreters, and the Secretariat for their contributions. 
 
119. The Commission agreed to close the meeting.

Australian Opening Statement －CCSBT8 in Miyako, Japan 
 
 
On behalf of the Australian government I would like to thank the people of Miyako, the 
Government of Iwate Prefecture and the Government of Japan for hosting this the 8th 
meeting of the CCSBT here in the northern fishing port of Miyako.  I understand that 
the port of Miyako is the hometown of Komatsu-san and I would thank him for bringing 
us to a very scenic part of Japan. This is one of the few times in many visits over recent 
years to Japan that I have been able to get out of Tokyo and enjoy some of the scenery 
and delights of your country and I am sure that the Australian delegation will enjoy their 
time here in Miyako. I was also impressed when reading the material on your fishing 
industry to see you have significant developments in aquaculture in Iwate Prefecture. 
 
I would like to welcome to this meeting representatives of Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and 
South Africa.  I understand that Korea will be acceding to the CCSBT and their 
permanent participation is welcome and they are congratulated on their membership.  I 
also note Andrew Penny is present from SA and his presence is always welcomed by the 
Australian delegation. 
 
It is pleasing to see so many industry representatives here at this meeting from the 
different countries. It is an indication of the importance of this fishery to our countries 
and perhaps a clear message to us as officials and negotiators that there is an expectation 
that we will manage this fishery in a responsible and open way. Australia will host the 
next CCSBT meeting and we hope to continue the practice you have set of meeting 
outside capital cities.  There are a number of options for a venue.  One that I know our 
industry is keen to promote is to meet in Port Lincoln, the home of Australia’s SBT 
industry.  A meeting in Port Lincoln if we can time it at the right time of the year will 
allow your industry to view the developments in farming and fattening that has provided 
a future for our industry.  We will advise the Secretariat by the end of the year of our 
preferred venue.   
 
To our interpreters it is always great to see you and we would find it difficult to have a 
productive meeting without you.  I will try to speak clearly in my Australian way and 
trust that you can interpret my own version of the Queens English in a way that my 
Japanese hosts can understand.  I agree it is not always an easy task. 
 
The Australian delegation is a large one and that probably reflects both the interest in 
the fishery and in Miyako.  Our delegation includes a combination of people who are 
well known to you and a number of new faces.  I will introduce the delegation.  
Banfield-san,  Frank Meere (Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Fisheries 
Management Authority, Derek Staples (Deputy Executive Director of  the Bureau of 
Rural Sciences), John Langtry and Emma Kerslake (from the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade), Josh Brien (Attorney General’s Department),  John Gunn (CSIRO), 
Charles Hausknecht from AFFA, Andrew MacNee (AFMA), Venessa Atkinson from 
Greenpeace.  From industry we have Brian Jeffriess, Robin Pike, Terry Romaro, Mr 
Eythor Eyjolfssen, Mr Kim, and Randa Salama. 
 
 
 
CCSBT 8 is an important meeting for all of us. 
 
The Commission has come through a very difficult time over the issue of the EFP and in 
trying to come to a common position on stock assessment processes for the SBT stock.  
We have been fortunate to now have the services of 5 eminent independent scientists 
and two excellent external chairs in Dr John Annala from NZ and Andrew Penny from 
South Africa. 
 
For Australia’s part we are keen to move forward and not to dwell on the past. In doing 
so I accept that there are issues on which we will not agree from time to time.  That is 
OK.  The important thing is that we continue to talk to each other and work through 
issues.  If we do this we will come to a better understanding of each other’s approach 
and requirements from the CCSBT and continue to move issues forward.  Australia’s 
position is that it will be guided by the direction that the external scientists believe is in 
the best interests of the fishery.  Sometimes we might not like what they suggest or 
agree with them but we will accept their guidance.  
 
Australia appreciates the normalisation of the CCSBT and as such respects the fact that 
we can now plan in advance our meetings for each year.  This is important for the 
countries who are involved in different RFMO,s and for the external scientists.  Yearly 
planning also allows the Secretariat to make advance bookings and purchases to reduce 
operating costs.  With this in mind Australia notes that this should be the only CCSBT 
meeting this year and as such has come to Miyako to finalise all the items on the agenda 
for this meeting. 
 
Both the Japanese and Australian CCSBT industries throughout the 1980’s and early 
1990’s took significant cuts to their SBT quotas in order to try and save and rebuild this 
fishery.  This caused a great deal of difficulties for our industry in Australia.  That we 
are still here together is testimony to their ability to adapt to new practices and continue 
to change in a changing world.  Our industry at the end of the 1980’s was in trouble, 
with banks moving in to take control of companies and with the help of Japanese 
industry and with a lot of Australian ingenuity they have managed to move a wild catch 
operation into a farming and fattening enterprise and as such rebuild their industry.  We 
in Australia are very conscious of product health and safety for human consumption and 
we have moved quickly on the development of a protocol with Japan on the contents of 
tuna and salmon feeds in light of recent concerns. 
 
The Japanese industry has had a harder road to follow as their reliance on a wild catch 
fishery on the high seas has not allowed them the same opportunities as Australia to 
diversify their industry and move into other fields.  What has been disappointing 
however and I know that it continues to a concern of both my industry and the Japanese 
industry is that the hard work that we have undertaken to try to rebuild the fishery has 
been undermined by non member countries who have had to date the luxury of 
operating without constraints and the responsibilities that are accepted by the members 
of the CCSBT.  It is time for that situation to change and for all countries to adopt a 
more co-operative approach to the management of this fishery. 
 
 
 
There are a number of key issues for this meeting. 
 
The TAC has not been set since 1997.  At this meeting we need to set a TAC.  In doing 
this we need to move away from the  CCSBT TAC of 11750 tonnes which covers 
Australia Japan and NZ and agree a global TAC for SBT that covers potential 
allocations to current and future non members alike.  It is simply unfair to expect current 
members who only account for about two-thirds of the global catch to have to carry the 
full burden of ensuring the sustainability of the fishery.  Once this global TAC is agreed 
then the CCSBT needs to exert maximum efforts to encourage the co-operation of all 
parties.  If, after a reasonable period this does not happen then there is a clear path open 
to the CCSBT to take action under the Action Plan that is WTO consistent to deal with 
this issue.   
 
In setting a global TAC however, the members must be precautionary because there is 
little good news from the latest Stock Assessment.  This fish is at very low levels and 
continued pressure on the spawning stock will endanger the fishery further.  Those 
strong age classes from the early 1990,s do not appear to have survived to contribute to 
the spawning stock biomass.  If we want a fishery in the future that our children can fish 
in then its about time we all became serious about its future and the level of catch it can 
stand.  
 
Australia would also look to setting a TAC for a period of 2 to 3 years and see this as a 
more sensible arrangement than haggling over quotas on a yearly basis when the 
assessment of the stock will not have changed.  I will talk more about this in our 
discussions on the TAC. 
 
Non members 
 
As I have mentioned above in my introduction, the time has come to put in place a WTO 
consistent plan to deal with non member catch.  This current level of non-member catch 
has to be reduced.  In the mid 1990’s the catch by non members was very low probably 
4- 600 tonnes of fish.  Today it can be anywhere up to 3,500 tonnes.  Where will it end, 
I suggest that it begins to end here today in Miyako.  And a clear message should go out 
to all non-members that if you want to catch our fish you do so as a co-operating party. 
 
As such I will welcome approaches for further discussions on membership from any of 
the non-members present at this meeting. 
 
The Spawning Ground 
 
The latest SC Report indicates some slight increase in the younger age classes, however 
there is little positive news about the spawning stock biomass.  As I mentioned it does 
not look as though any of the strong age classes from the early 1990’s have made it 
through to the spawning stock. We have information that there are a lot of boats fishing 
the spawning grounds around 1000 of which half come from the Taiwanese small boat 
fleet.  We would welcome and support initiatives that would stop all catch of SBT on 
the spawning grounds as a way of protecting the larger spawning fish which will help 
stabilize and rebuild the stock. 
 
 
 
SRP 
 
We welcome the work of the externals and the countries in progressing the SRP.  The 
tagging workshop was conduced recently in Australia and I look forward to positive 
discussion on how we move this important element of our work forward.  Australia has 
made a commitment to fund its share of the work under the SRP and it is a commitment 
that we intend to honour. 
 
The new Executive Secretary 
 
The new executive secretary has been appointed to the CCSBT and we welcome Brian 
Macdonald to the CCSBT.  While expectations from other countries of his performance 
will no doubt be high, Australia’s expectations of him in his new role have been clearly 
explained.  I would suggest that if it hasn’t already happened that the Chair of the 
CCSBT write formally to Campbell MacGregor thanking him for his work and 
forwarding to him a small gift as a token of our appreciation.  
 
Brian has presented a report that provides his thoughts on how the CCSBT might best 
move forward and there is obviously scope for the Secretariat to have a more active role 
in the conduct of the business of the Commission.  Brian has suggested that the 
Secretariat take on the role of co-ordinating the SRP under the guidance of CCSBT 
members and the external scientists.  We think this idea has merit and should be 
considered in discussions on the SRP. 
 
Bob Kennedy has also joined as data manager and again can provide a service to the 
members and to get value for money for his appointment we must have a program of 
work for him.  This could include making the TIS compulsory and extending it to cover 
all catch from members and non-members.  The Secretariat is far more than a post office 
and meeting organiser.  It costs members a significant amount to run and we should look 
to maximise our returns.  To help the Secretariat with costings a more active finance 
committee might be useful.  One that interacts with the Secretariat on a regular basis and 
not just at meetings. 
 
These, ladies and gentlemen, are our thoughts on some of the key issues to be addressed 
at this meeting.  We look forward to working constructively with other delegations 
during the course of this week and further advancing the work of the CCSBT. 
 
One final comment, Mr Chairman.  Many in this room will be aware of the bans which 
the Australian Government imposed on access for Japanese long line vessels to our 
ports.  These bans had a significant effect on SBT and providoring industries in both 
Japan and Australia.  I am pleased to formally record that these bans were fully lifted in 
May this year by the Australian Government.  As a result the Japanese long line fleet is 
welcome to visit our ports as are the fleets of other high seas fishing countries.  This 
access is available now on application for a port permit and several visits have already 
been made. We will be having discussions with officials from the JFA in Tokyo on 22 
October regarding a long term bilateral arrangement for port access for the Japanese 
long line fleet.  These discussions should reflect the rights and responsibilities of both 
 
 
sovereign countries, port and flag state responsibilities and the responsibilities we all 
have as members of regional fisheries management organisations and under international 
agreements.

Address of welcome by Mr. Yoshiaki Watanabe, the Director General of the 
Fisheries Agency, the Government of Japan 
 
Eighth Annual Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna (CCSBT8) 
 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman 
 
I am Yoshiaki Watanabe, the Director General of the Fisheries Agency of the 
Government of Japan. I am very pleased that the CCSBT8 is held in this place today, 
and on behalf the Government of Japan, I sincerely welcome the Chair, the 
representatives of the Parties and the country/entity here as observers, the independent 
chair of Scientific Committee (SC) and ladies and gentlemen to Japan. I also would like 
to express my sincere thanks to Mr. Suzuki, Member of the House of Representatives 
for his attendance at this meeting today despite of his tight schedule. 
 
As you know, Japan is a fishing nation surrounded on all sides by the blessings of the 
sea. Especially, the offshore of Sanriku coast in the Pacific ocean in front of us is world 
famous as one of the three greatest fishing grounds, where a cold current meets with a 
warm current and there are abundance of fish of the both   currents, such as northern 
bluefin tuna, pacific salmon and pacific saury, to be caught. Among the Sanriku coastal 
cities, Miyako city, where you are invited, has positively worked for resource 
management of salmon, oyster, wakame seaweed, etc using the benefits of the nature of 
this region. Miyako city is also a fishery base to 16 large-scale tuna longline fishing 
vessels targeting SBT. Therefore, I believe that it is an excellent venue for the annual 
meeting of CCSBT with its beautiful scenery.     
 
According to the estimation conducted by Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
united nations (FAO) on the current status of global fisheries resources, there is a 
situation where 60 ～ 70 % of those are fully-exploited or over-exploited now. With 
recognition that it is necessary to take immediate action for sustainable utilization of 
fisheries resources to ensure adequate amount of supply of animal protein for human 
being  in the future, in the 23rd Committee on Fisheries (COFI) held in February 1999, 
the FAO adopted “International Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing 
Capacity”which recommended that 20% ～ 30% of fishing capacity of large-scale tuna 
longline fishing vessels should be immediately reduced. Japan voluntary reduced 20% 
of large-scale tuna longline fishing vessels’ number in accordance with the Action Plan 
by March 1999 to contribute to a recovery of tuna resources. “International Plan of 
Action to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.”that 
was adopted in the 24th COFI held in March 2001, was also a significant progress for 
recourses management 
  
 
In view of the fact that almost all tuna products are exported to Japan, Japan, as a 
responsible market country, established Organization for Promotion of Responsible 
Tuna Fisheries (OPRT) in order to eliminate Flag of Convenience (FOC) vessels.  To 
accomplish its aim, the OPRT would publish material to show that tunas caught in a 
sound manner and would take actions to scrap FOC vessels.  Not to mention the 
reduction of tuna longline fishing vessels seriously damaged Japanese fishing industries. 
Japan voluntarily carried out the reduction to fulfill its international responsibility as the 
largest tuna fishing and consuming nation. However, we cannot expect fruitful results 
without cooperation of other countries. Results will be amplified with positive 
cooperation of countries, entities and regional fisheries management organizations 
associated with tuna fisheries. I strongly request the Parties and Observers for their 
continuous and positive work as tuna-fishing country /entity to accomplish their 
international responsibility for sustainable utilization of fisheries resources. 
 
Fisheries resources are recognized as significant to secure food for human beings  in 
the future. I recognize that it is the most important issue to be solved, particularly to 
take measures for sustainable utilization of resources. I hope that this annual meeting 
will contribute to tackle this issue. 
 
As you know, Miyako is quite a different place and has a different atmosphere and 
landscape from Tokyo, where you usually stay in Japan. I hope that you don’t miss this 
opportunity to enjoy your stay in Miyako. 
 
Thank you.

Welcome address as a representative of the local community  
in the opening of the CCSBT8 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I am Suzuki, a member of the House of Representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party. I, as 
a member of the Diet elected from this local community, would like to briefly greet you on 
the opening of CCSBT8. 
 
First of all I would like to welcome representatives of the Parties of CCSBT, observers, the 
chair of Scientific Committee (SC), who takes efforts to promote a scientific discussion at 
CCSBT, and the Secretariat of CCSBT to Japan. We are very pleased to welcome you to 
Miyako. 
 
As the Director General of the Fisheries Agency mentioned, the coast of the Sanriku region is 
very famous as one of great fishing grounds in the world. Miyako is also one of the largest 
bases of large-scale tuna longline fisheries in Japan, which is to be a topic of this meeting 
from today, and it ranks as large as Kesennuma, Miyagi Prefecture in Tohoku-district. In this 
respect, there are very high interests and expectations in this region to the outcome of this 
meeting. 
 
I, as a member of the Diet elected from Iwate Prefecture, and a representative of Japan as a 
fishing nation, have positively tackled the issues of measures for the promotion of coastal and 
offshore fisheries as well as far seas fisheries such as tuna fisheries and whaling. 
 
In the course of tackling those issues, we have leaned the importance of resources 
management and the necessity of conservation of the fishing ground environment through 
making these abundant resources utilized carefully and sustainably. I believe that this spirit 
should be reflected to the discussion within the CCSBT which purpose is ensuring adequate 
conservation and effective utilization of SBT resources. Japanese fishermen who engage in 
the 
large-scale 
tuna 
longliners 
particularly 
have 
earnestly 
cooperated 
with 
international/regional fisheries organizations such as the CCSBT and have not only accepted 
drastically cut of their amount of catch but also voluntarily reduced number of vessels by 
20% of the total vessels. Of course, these measures could not be achieved without 
fishermen’s great pains. Japanese fishermen have made utmost efforts for appropriate 
conservation of marine living resources with accepting such pains. However, the reason they 
can continue their efforts is a hope, they can expect in the near future, which would enable 
sustainable use of the resources and possible expansion of catch limit. In this respect, I 
believe, we have an obligation to appreciate fishermen’s effort and try to meet their 
expectations.  I think that each participant of this meeting has a background of different 
fisheries history and food culture. However, we can have common ideas on the purpose of the 
Convention to ensure adequate conservation and sustainable utilization of resources on 
scientific bases, and the spirit of the  (UNCLOS). I believe that if we share our wisdom on 
this issue based on the ideas and spirit, we can surely achieve satisfactory results.  I expect 
an animated discussion and fruitful results. 
 
Lastly, I hope that your stay in Miyako will be comfortable and significant for you.

Opening Statement by Japan 
Eighth meeting of the Commission for the Conservation 
of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT8) 
Miyako, Japan 
15 October 2001 
 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
 
Japan, Australia and New Zealand as the members of the Commission for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) have worked for management and 
optimum utilization of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) to date. However, we have not been 
able to decide a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) because of the large differences of views on 
the stock status of SBT among the members. Also this situation was further complicated 
when Australia and NZ filed to the international arbitral tribunal.  As a result, the CCSBT 
became temporarily dysfunctional. However, after the completion of tribunal activities, 
situation has been improving and I am pleased to note the current improvement of 
functioning of the CCSBT under the cooperation of the members. 
 
The current stock status and recommendations for the future have been proposed for the 
first time in three years by the 2nd meeting of Stock Assessment Group (SAG) and 6th 
meeting of Scientific Committee (SC) held in this August. We are now able to approve a 
Scientific Research Program (SRP) that is necessary for appropriate future resource 
management of SBT on a sound scientific base and observe the significant development 
of it. Japan will strongly support a stock assessment system on a scientific base. The 
improvement of the scientific functioning of the Commission is due to the initiative and 
great contribution of the external scientists and independent chairs of SAG and SC. I 
would like to express my gratitude again and also expect a further contribution to the 
development of the scientific aspect of the CCSBT in the future. 
 
At this meeting, we will discuss the setting of a TAC based upon the recommendation of 
the 6th SC on stock assessment. It is very important for us, as a responsible regional 
fisheries management organization, to promptly take adequate conservation and 
management measures to progress non-member issues. Japan sincerely hopes that a TAC, 
which has not been set since 1998, will be set in this meeting for 2002. 
 
On the other hand, in terms of non-members issues, I regret to mention that the Republic 
of Korea has not finalized its international process for accession to the Convention by 
commencing day of this meeting. However, I sincerely hope that it will accede soon to the 
Convention and contribute to the resource management activities of the Commission. We 
also observe progress, such as adopting the “Action Plan” and establishing the “Extended 
Commission”, to promote early accession to the Convention and to ensure cooperation by 
other non-members. I believe that it is necessary for the CCSBT to proceed with the 
progress and materialize it.  For this purpose, it is necessary for us to fully discuss the 
matter and, if necessary, we should decide further action in accordance with the “Action 
Plan”for further progress on the non-members issues.  
 
Finally, it is now possible for the Commission to rapidly improve its functioning through 
the initiative and the contribution of the external scientists. The Secretariat also has 
become more substantial by the addition of new staff members, the Executive Secretary 
and Database manager. I strongly hope that each party will cope with various issues in a 
cooperative manner without losing this momentum so that this meeting will be a fruitful 
one. 
 
Thank you.

Eighth Annual Meeting of the Commission 
15 - 19 October 2001  
Miyako, Japan 
Korea’s Opening Statement 
 
 
Thank you and Good afternoon!   
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers, and ladies and gentlemen!  
On behalf of my Korean delegation, I am greatly honored to be here in Miyako for 
the eighth CCSBT meeting.  We extend our special gratitude to the Government of 
Japan and Miyako for providing this excellent place to hold our meeting.  We also 
welcome the new Executive Secretary of the CCSBT, Mr. Brian MacDonald. We 
believe his insight and leadership will guide and support the Commission as it may face 
various complicated matters. 
The most urgent issue for the CCSBT is the evaluation of current level of SBT stock 
and the estimation of the long-term sustainable harvest level under the scheduled 
projects of stock rebuilding by 2020.  According to the series of the Commission 
meeting, SAG meeting, and SC meeting held since last April, the rebuilding process of 
the SBT stock appears uncertain.  Special concerns and efforts should be paid to detect 
any signs of positive and/or negative impacts of the current catch level on the 
sustainability or recovery of the SBT stocks.  Korea understands that during the past 
decade, the stabilizing trend of the current stock, despite minor fluctuations, should be 
considered as a steppingstone to build on as we strive to obtain our desired 2020 goal.  
Since the last Commission Meeting, Korea, as a designate-Member to the CCSBT, 
spent every effort to participate in and cooperate with all intersessional meetings, 
including the 2nd SAG meeting, the 6th SC meeting, and the Tagging Workshop.  Its 
participation in all these meetings can be interpreted as a first step towards meeting its 
obligations for becoming a Member of the CCSBT.  At its initial stage of membership 
to the CCSBT, Korea is trying to stay atop of all the current issues including the 
implementation of the Scientific Research Program.  However, Korea needs some time 
to further examine in detail the items of the SRP that was previously agreed by the 
existing Members. 
Regarding the Korea’s accession to the CCSBT, the Cabinet Council of the Korean 
Government approved it last month and the final domestic procedure is under way for 
the deposit of the instrument of accession.  As a new member to the Convention, 
Korea will fulfill its responsibilities and obligations, including payment of its 
contribution this year.  Given that Korea will deposit the instrument of accession soon, 
I would like to request that Korea be regarded as a full member at this annual meeting.  
In this regard, I want to formally ask this Commission to consider this issue under 
agenda 3, “Accession of Korea.”  Korea fully deserves the recognition which includes 
right to participate in any process at this meeting.  In short, Korea’s instrument of 
accession will be deposited within a couple of weeks, and such a short period of time 
should not preclude Korea’s privilege and responsibility of participating as a full 
member in all activities at this meeting.  
I hope this meeting will produce fruitful outcomes. 
Thank you.

NEW ZEALAND OPENING STATEMENT－CCSBT8 
 
 
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. We are looking forward to working with the 
delegations from Australia, Japan and Korea under the guidance of our new chair, Mr 
Ito. We also extend a warm welcome to the representatives from Korea and Taiwan and 
who are with us. 
 
We are pleased with the work that has been undertaken since we last met in April 2001. 
The Stock Assessment Group and the Scientific Committee met in August and the 
Tagging Workshop met in September. 
 
The outcomes of the SAG and SC meetings resulted in the first consensus report in 
more than six years on the status of the Southern bluefin tuna stock and the likelihood 
of the Commission reaching its stated management objectives. We are particularly 
grateful for the role the External Advisory Panel played in achieving this consensus. It 
is now our responsibility as members of the Commission to act on the recommendations 
put forward by the SC and take measures consistent with our management objectives.  
 
We still need to actively continue negotiations with non-members to determine the steps 
required to achieve closer co-operation. In the meantime we regard restraint of non-
members catch as an essential component of an improved potential for stock rebuild. 
We look forward to hearing from Korea on the progress it has made towards accession. 
The Commission has always placed the highest priority on enlarging its membership to 
include all those who have an interest in the fishery.  
 
In addition to engaging with non-member the Commission has undertaken a significant 
amount of work since its inception in 1993. Its scientific work has, in particular, played 
a critical role in the setting of total catch levels. Agreement on total catch is important 
for the conservation of the stock as is also the fair and reasonable allocation of catch 
amongst both existing and future members of the Commission. 
 
We are confident that in the next few days we will build on the progress we achieved at 
out last meeting and we look forward to a successful outcome from our discussions. We 
also welcome Mr Brian MacDonald as Executive Secretary of the CCSBT and Mr Bob 
Kennedy as Database Manager. 
 
Thank you.

The 8th CCSBT Commission Meeting 
Opening Statement 
 
Taiwan 
October 15, 2001 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
First of all, on behalf of the Taiwan delegation, I would like to express our 
gratitude to the CCSBT Secretariat for inviting us to participate in this meeting. I would 
also like to take this opportunity to extend my appreciation to Japan, for its efforts to 
host this meeting in this beautiful city, Miyako.  
 
As a major fishing nation in the world, Taiwan has always understood and 
supported the importance of the conservation and management of the highly migratory 
tuna resources. In particular, we have cooperated with CCSBT on the measures adopted 
for the conservation and management for Southern Bluefin Tunas, such as imposing a 
self-restraint catch limit since 1996, providing catch statistics, practicing TIS since June 
2000, and participating in scientific researches such as harbor sampling with Australia, 
and encouraging our fishermen to cooperate in the tagging program. 
 
Since this April after the 7th Annual Meeting, CCSBT representatives have been to 
Taiwan to exchange opinions with our side, and the results have been constructive. 
However, there remain issues for our participation in the CCSBT to be further discussed 
and finalized. In the future, Taiwan will continue to demonstrate its good will so as to 
engage itself in a further dialogue with CCSBT on these relevant issues. We wish 
CCSBT could realize the actual difficulties Taiwan’s fisheries have faced, so as to reach 
a mutually acceptable conclusion.  
 
Finally, I wish this a fruitful and successful meeting. Again, I would like to join 
other delegates to express my thanks to the Japanese Government for this 
well-organized meeting.

Statement made by Taiwan in the Plenary 
 
18 October 2001 
 
Taiwan has a common interest with the Members of the Commission in conservation of 
SBT stocks. It is Taiwan’s understanding that the work of the Commission is to enhance 
the effective conservation of SBT. As a gesture of our good will to the respond to the 
work under the Convention, Taiwan would like to take the following measures. 
 
1. Taiwan accepts the catch quota of 1140 tons as agreed between the parties concerned. 
 
2. Taiwan will not issue trading information scheme certificate to any catch of SBT over 
the above agreed set catch quota. 
 
3. Taiwan will avail itself of the provisions of the Resolution adopted by the 
Commission in April 2001, to apply to become a Member of the Extended 
Commission and Extended Scientific Committee for the Conservation of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna. Taiwan will use the nomenclature either as Chinese Taipei or Fishing 
Entity of Taiwan. It will make its best endeavors to lodge an application to become a 
Member as soon as possible. 
 
4. Taiwan will not issue TIS document to any fresh SBT caught in SBT spawning 
ground, provided that location of SBT spawning ground being given by CCSBT. 
 
5. Taiwan fully supports measures combating against FOC fishing activities. We will 
cooperate with members of the CCSBT in gathering relevant information pertaining 
to FOC vessels. 
 
 
Thank you very much.

annual meeting, the Commission will consider imposing trade-restrictive measures, 
which avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade,  
to prevent non-members from continuing to conduct fishing activities which diminish 
the effectiveness of conservation and management measures for SBT. 
 
4. 
That at its next annual meeting, the Commission shall decide on appropriate 
measures, consistent with paragraph 6 of the Action Plan, which may include 
prohibiting the import of SBT and its products in any form from Cambodia, Honduras 
and Equatorial Guinea, unless the Commission decides at that meeting or before, that 
these non-members have taken appropriate action to ensure that there fishing activities 
do not diminish conservation and management measures for SBT. 
 
Attachment I 
 
 
DRAFT DECISION REGARDING INDONESIA PURSUANT TO THE 2000 
ACTION PLAN 
 
 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (the Commission), 
 
Noting that the Commission has recognised that the cooperation of Indonesia is essential 
to ensure the effective conservation and management of SBT; 
 
Welcoming recent indications that Indonesia would join the Commission; 
 
Recognising that Indonesia exercises jurisdiction and control over waters that contain 
important parts of the SBT spawning grounds; 
 
Noting further the adoption by the Commission of the Action Plan on non-members in 
March 2000; 
 
Recalling that the Commission has repeatedly sought the cooperation of Indonesia as a 
non-member whose vessels fish for SBT to ensure the effective conservation and 
management of SBT; 
 
Gravely concerned that fishing activities within Indonesian waters are diminishing the 
effectiveness of conservation and management measures for SBT and that no action has 
been taken to rectify such activities; 
 
DECIDES as follows: 
 
1. 
That Indonesia be identified, pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Action Plan, as a 
non-member the vessels of which have been catching SBT in a manner which 
diminishes the effectiveness of conservation and management measures for SBT. 
 
2. 
To instruct the Executive Secretary to write to Indonesia on behalf of the 
Commission informing Indonesia of the decision to identify it under paragraph 2 of the 
Action Plan, and to again request Indonesia to cooperate with the Commission and 
rectify its fishing activities so as not to diminish the effectiveness of conservation and 
management measures for SBT, and to advise the Commission of actions taken in that 
regard prior to the next annual session of the Commission. 
 
3.         To instruct the Executive Secretary to again urge Indonesia to take measures to 
prevent fishing activities in waters that contain important parts of the SBT spawning 
grounds and to  take appropriate measures to ensure that SBT Statistical Documents are 
completed in accordance with the requirements of the Trade Information Scheme 
adopted by the Commission in November 1999 that came into operation on 1 June 2000.

Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
16 – 18 October 2001 
Miyako, Japan 
 
 
1. 
Opening 
 
1. 
The Finance and Administration Committee met from 16 to 18 October 2001 in 
conjunction with CCBST8. The List of Participants is attached as Annex 1. 
Messrs. Charles Hausknecht and Akihiro Mae were nominated as co-chairs by 
the Commission. 
 
2. 
Adoption of Agenda 
 
2. 
The adopted agenda is attached as Annex 2. 
 
3. 
Consideration of Korean contribution to the budget 
 
3. 
Korea indicated that its domestic procedure to accede to the Convention would 
be completed within a couple of weeks and that its contribution for the 2001 
financial year was ready to be paid immediately after it acceded and received 
notification from the Secretariat to pay its contribution. The meeting proceeded 
based on the assumption that the Korean contribution would be available for 
the 2001 financial year and thereafter. 
 
4. 
Revision of 2001 Budget 
 
4. 
The Executive Secretary presented the proposed revision of the 2001 budget 
(CCSBT/0110/08). In the proposed revision, expenditure was expected to total 
$A 1.424 million ($A0.223 million more than the original budget). The main 
reasons for the increases were: 
 
- 
additional costs for the Annual Meeting 
- 
increased Secretariat travel costs 
- 
separation costs for the previous Executive Secretary 
- 
increased costs for Advisory Panel members 
 
5. 
On additional costs for the Annual Meeting, New Zealand said that these far 
exceeded the costs of holding the meeting in Canberra. Bearing in mind the 
budgetary pressures the Commission was facing and the possibility of 
increased costs for holding the meeting outside Canberra, New Zealand stated 
its view that the meeting should continue to be held in Canberra. If the meeting 
was held outside Canberra, then any additional costs for doing so should be 
borne by the host country and not the Commission. 
 
 
6. 
Korea suggested that, since the increase in the budget within the same year 
might make it difficult for the contracting parties to prepare necessary an 
additional contribution, every effort should be made to avoid any revision 
within each financial year. 
 
7. 
The Executive Secretary indicated that funds not spent to date were to cover 
costs of holding ERSWG, some travel costs to attend other international 
organizations, and costs for the purchase of a computer and software for the 
CCSBT database. Within these costs, travel costs to attend CCAMLR meeting 
would not be necessary, as the Commission had decided that one of the 
Member countries would provide an observer to this meeting. Accordingly, the 
Secretariat modified the draft 2001 budget, which is shown as Annex 3. 
 
8. 
The Committee recommends that the Commission endorse the revised 
2001 budget as shown in Annex 3. While agreeing this recommendation, 
Japan noted that its government would need to consider the expenditure in the 
context of national arrangements, since no arrangement was prepared in its 
national budget during this financial year to meet an increase in the 
contribution, due to the short notice of the proposal. 
 
5. 
2002 Budget 
 
9. 
The Committee considered the draft budget for 2002 (CCSBT/0110/09) 
submitted by the Secretariat to identify where potential savings could be made 
in the draft budget without impairing the effective implementation of the 2002 
workplan. The Committee requests that the Secretariat amend the draft 2002 
budget reflecting suggestions which includes: 
 
- 
to convene back-to-back meetings of the CPUE Modelling Group and 
the 1st Management Strategy Development Workshop and reducing the 
time allotted for scientific meetings where possible 
 
- 
to convene the Emergency SAG meeting back-to-back with the SC in 
September or October 
 
- 
to reduce the expected number of Advisory Panel attending the 
meetings from five to four 
 
10. 
Funds for tagging program coordination only have been included in the draft 
budget for 2002 (a detailed breakdown of funds for this item is provided as 
Annex 5). The 2002 budget does not include the direct financial expenses of 
implementing the Scientific Research Program (SPR) tagging program, the 
specific components of which will be financed directly by individual members 
carrying out the respective components, consistent with the Commissions 
decision on this matter. It was further noted that an emergency SAG may not be 
necessary in which case the funds could be reallocated to other areas of the 
budget as needed, eg. to tagging program coordination. Further savings could 
be made if the emergency SAG was not needed and the 3rd SAG could be held 
back-to-back with the 7th SC. In light of the Commissions advice that the 
Secretariat will not attend other RFMO meetings in 2002, the Secretariat travel 
budget has been reduced to reflect staff attendance at workshops, the meeting 
of the Commission and subsidiary committees only. 
 
11. 
Further saving could potentially be realized if member countries made 
available meeting facilities and administrative staff to support the Secretariat at 
meetings or workshops convened outside Canberra, so reducing the number of 
Secretariat staff needed to attend meetings outside Canberra. 
 
12. 
The Committee set a total gross expenditure limit of A$1,650,000 for 2002 to 
provide the Secretariat with some flexibility in supporting the Commissions 
activities for 2002 within this total amount. 
 
 
The Committee recommends that the Commission note the above matters 
and endorse the draft budget for 2002, provided at Annex 4. 
 
13. 
Members noted that it was desirable to stabilize the Commission deliberative 
process with respect to each annual budget and agree funding, and resultant 
membership contributions, well in advance of the start of each Commission 
financial year. This would minimize the requirement for additional 
contributions to the budget from members at a later stage, when it caused 
difficulties for member governments to provide further funds additional to 
these (in many cases) already settled on through the representative domestic 
budgetary processes of individual member countries. 
 
6. 
Others 
 
14. 
No other matter was discussed.

Update of the Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery 
for the 1999/00 and Preliminary 2000/01 Seasons 
Prepared by Carolyn Robins, BRS (2 October 2001) 
 
1. 
Introduction 
The Australian domestic SBT preliminary catch during the 1999/00 season 
(1 December 1999 to 30 November 2000) was 5257 tonnes. The preliminary 2000/01 
catch (1 December 2000 to 30 November 2001) reported by 28 September 2001 is 
5235 tonnes.  
2. 
Operational Constraints on Effort 
Regulatory Measures 
Domestic operators are managed through individual transferable quotas (ITQs) granted 
as Statutory Fishing Rights (SFRs) under the Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery 
Management Plan 1995. Although the global total allowable catch (TAC) has not been 
determined by the Commission since 1998, Australia agreed to maintain its national 
catch limit at 5265 tonnes, which has remained unchanged since 1989/90. 
3. 
Catch and Effort 
The SBT landings each season were: 
1999/00 
South Australia 
 
5143 tonnes  (5130t in farms and 13t longline)  
and Western Australia  
 
New South Wales 
 
114 tonnes (longline)    
and Tasmania  
 
 
2000/01 
South Australia 
 
5175 tonnes (5162t in farms and 13t longline) 
and Western Australia  
 
New South Wales 
 
60 tonnes (longline)        
and Tasmania  
 
 
SBT caught for fish farms in South Australia, using purse seine vessels, utilise most of 
the Australian quota (3% in 1991/92 to over 97% in 1999/00 and 2000/01). The 
domestic longlining component declined from 10% in 1996/97 to less than 3% in 
1999/00 and 2000/01. There were no SBT poled off South Australia or trolled off 
Tasmania during either season. 
4. 
Historical Catch and Effort 
Major restructuring occurred in Australia’s SBT fisheries following reductions in the 
global TAC and national catch allocations in the late 1980s. Attachment A summarises 
the catch taken by each sector of the Australian industry since 1988/89. Confidentiality 
guidelines prevent the release of data from groups of less than 5 boats. Therefore, data 
are combined for some fishing methods.  
5. 
Annual Fleet Size and Distribution 
Fishing for SBT, by eight purse seine vessels, for the farm operations in South Australia 
commenced in December 1999 and continued until March 2000. Some longlining also 
occurred in South Australia (2 vessels), Tasmania (2 vessels) and Western Australia (18 
vessels). Longline fishing off New South Wales (37 vessels) commenced in May 2000 
and continued until November.  
During the 2000/01 season eight purse seine vessels caught fish for the Port Lincoln 
tuna farms. Fishing started in December and most of the available quota had been caught 
by March 2001. Twenty-five vessels longlined in NSW, 16 in WA, 4 in SA and 1 in 
Tasmania. 
6. 
Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
Australian’s began fishing for SBT in the early 1950s off New South Wales and South 
Australia and then later (1970) off Western Australia. The Australian catch peaked at 
21 500 tonnes in 1982. Historically, the bulk of the Australian catch had been used for 
canning.  
The introduction of an ITQ based management plan in 1984 based on an Australian 
TAC of 14 500 tonnes resulted in the redistribution of quota ownership. Progressively 
over the mid to late 1980s, the Australian catch focussed on supplying the Japanese 
sashimi market, with an increasing amount of the catch being transhipped to Japanese 
freezer vessels in the Great Australian Bight. 
In the late 1980s the Australian quota reductions to 5265 tonnes led to further 
restructuring. From 1990 to 1994 approximately half the Australian quota was taken by 
Australia-Japan joint venture longliners. With the termination of the joint venture 
arrangement in 1995 Australian catches again focused on the surface fishery with poling 
operations supplying the fresh chilled sashimi market and purse seiners providing SBT 
to farms. 
Since 1992 there has been a progressive increase in the number of SBT taken for 
farming operations. In the 2000/01 season this component utilised over 98% the 
Australian quota resulting in quota being less available for other operations. 
7. 
Fisheries Monitoring 
The monitoring arrangements in the SBT fishery continue to be reviewed and refined in 
order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the procedures. To prevent the 
incidental bycatch of SBT off NSW, operators with insufficient quota were prohibited 
from operating in the zone south of Sydney from June to September 2000 and 2001. The 
catch disposal records, including one designed to cater for farm operations, were readily 
adopted in 1999/00. During the 1999/00 and 2000/01 seasons AFMA Compliance 
Officers were deployed on farm tow vessels to observe procedures and protocols. These 
operations will continue in future seasons. In addition, farm monitoring procedures are 
reviewed annually with boat inspections while in port and the monitoring of all transfers 
of fish to farm cages continuing. The AFMA Compliance Program also introduced an 
ongoing audit of fishing records in 2000/01.  
8. 
Other factors 
Import/Export Statistics 
The Trade Information Scheme that records all exported Australian fish has been 
implemented and refined. This program will provide a complete record of SBT exports 
that can be compared with the Japanese Import Statistics.  
Markets 
More than 95% of Australia’s SBT catch is exported to Japan.

Review of Southern Bluefin Tuna Fisheries of Japan in the 2001 Fishing Season 
(Provisional since the 2001 fishing season has not completed.) 
 
1. Introduction 
(1) 
The total amount of catch of SBT for the 2001 fishing season (1 March 2001 - 28 February 
2002) was 5,412 tons at 30 September 2001 and is expected to reach the voluntary catch 
limit set by Japan around early December. 
(2) 
Japanese distant-water tuna longline fishing, including fishing for SBT, faces a severe 
economic situation due to a decline in demand for tuna because of the long recession in 
Japan and a fall in the price of tuna caused by increased import of tuna. 
 
2. Operational Constraints on Effort 
(1) 
GOJ is managing the catch of SBT for each fishing season based on TAC and national 
allocations agreed by CCSBT. 
(2) 
GOJ originally took voluntary measures to set a limit of catch (6,065tons) for the 2001 
fishing season, same as the national allocation for Japan agreed in 1997, since no agreement 
was reached for this season. However, this voluntary catch limit was changed to 6,432 tons 
by increasing 356tons, which was the half of the returned amount of catch (711tons) in 1999 
based on the provisional measures prescribed by ITLOS. 
(3) 
Further, GOJ is managing the fishing operations by introducing the time/area closure in 
order to protect the spawning grounds and juveniles. 
(4) 
The industry sets voluntary starting days for three sub-fishing areas (high seas area off 
Tasmania/Sydney, high seas area off Cape Town and Southern Indian Ocean), and limits the 
total number of vessels for each sub-fishing area. 
 
3. Catch and Effort (refer to Appendix 1) 
In the 2001 fishing season, the fishing operations in the high seas area off Tasmania/Sydney and 
off Cape Town have been closed with the catch of 1,787tons by 69 vessels and 3,085tons by 99 
vessels, respectively. The operations in the Southern Indian Ocean are still undertaken. 
 
4. Historical Catch and Effort (refer to Appendix 1) 
(1) 
In the 1998 fishing season, GOJ took voluntary measures to set a limit of 6,065 tons, same 
as the agreed amount of catch as the national allocation to Japan in 1997, in the absence of 
a decision on TAC by the Commission. The actual catch in 1998 was 6,038tons. 
(2) 
In the 1999 fishing season, GOJ originally took the same voluntary measures as the 1998 
fishing season, in the absence of a decision on TAC by the Commission.  However, 
following the prescription of provisional measures by ITLOS concerning the experimental 
fishing conducted by Japan, the actual catch in 1999 was reduced by 711tons to 5,354tons. 
(4) 
In the 2000 fishing season, GOJ set the voluntary catch limit of 4,578tons, 1,487tons less 
than 6,065tons which was the national allocation to Japan agreed in 1997. However, since 
the provisional measures prescribed by ITLOS was revoked in August 2000, the 
voluntary catch limit was changed to 6,065tons in September 2000. The actual catch in 
2000 was 6,027tons. 
 
5. Annual Fleet Size and Distribution (refer to Appendix 1) 
The number of fishing vessels targeting SBT in the 2001 fishing season was 227.  The number 
of vessels on the high seas off Tasmania/Sydney was 69, the number of vessels on the high seas 
off Cape Town was 99, and the number of vessels in Southern Indian Ocean was 59. 
 
6. Historical Fleet Size and Distribution (refer to Appendix 1) 
(1) 
Until the end of the 1998 fishing season, 257 fishing vessels operated for each year. 
(2) 
In the 1999 fishing season, 227 fishing vessels, 30 vessels less than the 1998 fishing seasons, 
operated, since Japan cut the number of distant-water tuna longliners based on the plan of 
action agreed by FAO. 
(3) 
For the 2000 fishing season, the number of vessels for SBT was reduced to 172 in 
accordance with the reduction of the catch limit based on the provisional measures 
prescribed by ITLOS. However, since the provisional measures were revoked, 199 vessels, 
27 vessels more than the original, operated for SBT based on the increase of the catch limit 
in September. 
 
7. Fisheries Monitoring 
(1) 
GOJ issued a notification to the industry that SBT catch should be reported every 10days for 
the management of the catch limit. 
(2) 
GOJ took necessary measures to control and monitor the fishery, which include dispatching 
enforcement vessels to the fishing area, observers on board of operating vessels, as well as 
requirement for fishing vessels to install VMS on board vessels and to report a daily position 
to GOJ. 
(3) 
During the same period, Japan dispatched 4 enforcement vessels to the fishing area of SBT. 
(4) 
In the 2001 fishing season, the number of observers to monitor the operation on board was 
15. Japan is facing the difficulty to dispatch the observers and the observer cost is increasing 
since port call to Australian ports are not possible virtually. 
 
8. Others factors (The amount of import of SBT to Japan: refer to Appendix 2) 
(1) 
From 1993 to 1998, the amount of SBT imported to Japan had significantly increased.  
Since 1998, the amount of SBT import has been stable at around just over 10,000tons 
(product weight). 
(2) 
The amount of import of SBT in 2000 was 10,356tons (product weight).  Import from 
the biggest 5 exporting country/entities (1: Australia, 2: Taiwan, 3: Republic of Korea, 4: 
New Zealand, 5: Indonesia) accounts for 99.6% of the total. 
(3) 
Import from Australia, the biggest exporting country/area of SBT to Japan has increased 
its export of SBT steadily, reaching 7,831tons (product weight) in 2000.  This amount 
of SBT accounts for 75.6% of the total import of SBT to Japan. 
(4) 
Import of SBT from countries other than members of CCSBT, ROK, Taiwan and 
Indonesia has been significantly decreased since the introduction of TIS in June 2000.

Annual Review of SBT Fisheries 
by 
Republic of Korea 
 
Dae-Yeon Moon and Kwang-Ho Choi  
National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI) 
Republic of Korea 
 
Introduction 
 
   The Korean longline fishery for southern bluefin tuna began its operation in the 
southern Indian Ocean in 1991. Until 1995, the number of longliners was very few 
ranging 1-3 vessels annually, followed by an increase to 8 vessels in 1996 and further to 
19 in 1998.  Recently the fleet size decreased to 16 longliners. At the early stage of this 
fishery, some vessels fishing for tropical tunas moved seasonally southward to target 
southern bluefin tuna. Accordingly, fishing activities by these vessels were limited to a 
few months of the year. During the years 1991-1993 the lonliners operated in five to six 
months each year, but thereafter their operation time has increased to almost whole 
year.  
   Due to the increased fishing days and fleet size, annual catch has continuously 
increased from 1992 onward and reached a peak in 1998, followed by a continual 
decrease until recently. The total annual catch for 2000 was 980 mt by 16 longliners, a 
22.3 % decrease compared to 1999. Most fishing operations by the Korean SBT fishery  
were carried out in two regions on a seasonal basis; the southeastern and southwestern 
fishing grounds.      
 
Catch and Effort 
 
   Nominal catch by Korean longline fishery has shown a contunual increase by 1998, 
reaching the highest at 1,562 mt with 19 vessels. Since then, catchses began to decrease 
until recently due to the volultary regulation of SBT fishery by the Government of the 
Repulic of Korea. The 2000 catch was 980 mt with 16 longliners, showing a decrease 
by 22.3 % from 1999 figure (Table 2).   
   The catch per unit effort (CPUE), expressed as the number of fish caught per 1,000 
hooks, has shown an increasing trend from 1.8 in 1992 to 8.4 in 1994, followed by 
decrease to 5.7 in the following year (Table 1).  However, from 1996 to 1998, it 
remained somewhat stable around 3.5-4.0 fish/1,000 hooks, followed by a decrease to 
2.3 in 2000. It was noted from the monthly CPUE analyses that catch efficiency was 
higher from March to October than other months of the year.  
    Species composition of the longline catch indicated that although the percentage of 
southern bluefin tuna varied over the years, it made up of the major part of the total 
catch. In 1999, southern bluefin tuna accounted for 95.2% of the total catch and the 
remaining 15.7% constituted bigeye, yellowfin, swordfish and other species including 
billfishes. 
 
 
 
Size composition 
 
   Size data of southern bluefin tuna have routinely been collected by National Fisheries 
Research and Development Institute (NFRDI) from fishing vessels. The reported fork 
length of this species ranged from 78 to 197cm (average 146.6cm), of which fish with 
145-160cm fork length accounted for over 50% of the total fish measured on board by 
fishermen. However, number of sampled fishes was only a few. Therefore, we presented 
here only for the months that over 30 SBT has been sampled (Fig. 1).    
 
Fleet size and distribution 
 
   Longlining is the only gear for the Korean SBT fishery. At the beginning of the 
fishery, only a few ranging 1-3 vessels carried out seasonal fishing for SBT. From 1996, 
SBT-targetting longliners increased and both 1998 and 1999 they reached the highest at 
19 but the fleet size decreased to 16 in 2000. 
  The Korean longlining operation area for southern bluefin tuna is broad but largely 
divided into two regions (Figs 4-14). Until 1993, most fishing operation was 
concentrated in the southeastern part of the ocean while from 1994 onwards some 
longliners extended their operation to the southwestern waters off the southern tip of 
Africa, further to the southeastern Atlantic Ocean in some years. However, fishing 
activities have generally concentrated on the areas between 35-45oS and 90-120oE,  30-
45oS and 0-60oE. Higher CPUE distribution was shown in the southwestern part of the 
ocean off the southern tip of South Africa.. Monthly CPUE distribution during the years 
1996-2000 clearly indicates that most fishing activities were carried out in the western 
Indian Ocean for the first half of the year, whereas for the second half starting from July 
the fleet shifted eastward. 
 
Research 
 
   Research on tuna and tuna-like species are being carried out by NFRDI. The research 
are focused on tuna fisheries and biology based on catch and effort data as well as 
length frequency data collected from commercial fishing vessels. Those data collected 
from fishing vessels are compiled and submitted after statistical analysis to the 
international fisheries organizations or reported to various tuna meetings including 
CCSBT. Data collection system for most tuna and tuna-like species caught by Korean 
tuna fisheries has well been established but that for the southern bluefin tuna was 
recently developed.

Review of New Zealand SBT Fisheries for CCSBT–8 
 
1. 
Introduction 
Three fishing methods are used to target SBT in the EEZ.  By far, most fishing is with surface 
longline (96% over the previous 10 years) with a small amount of fishing occasionally done by 
trolling and handlining.  The domestic fishery is composed of a wide range of vessel types 
including a variable number of small owner-operated boats and 4–5 low temperature freezer 
longliners chartered by a New Zealand company that otherwise are part of the Japanese distant 
water fleet. Both the chartered vessels and the New Zealand owner-operated vessels fish 
competitively against New Zealand’s SBT catch allocation. 
As is typical, fishing for SBT in 2000–01 was primarily conducted off the west coast of the South 
Island and the northeast coast of the North Island.  In the absence of an agreed TAC and 
allocation for the 2000–01 fishing season, New Zealand restricted SBT catches to 420 tonnes, the 
level last agreed in the CCSBT. The voluntary catch level was further reduced to 395 t to 
compensate for the domestic fishery exceeding the catch limit in 1999–00. New Zealand closed 
the fishery in late June with 359 t of SBT landed. Although SBT can be caught in most months in 
the EEZ, the bulk of landings are in the May to July period. In 2000–01 the season was very short 
with 78% of landings done in the month the fishery was closed. 
2. 
Operational constraints on effort 
 
Voluntary measures 
The domestic fishing industry has undertaken a number of voluntary measures with respect to 
longline fishing first set out in a “Code of Practice” in April 1994.  Specific measures include gear 
specifications, environmental standards, suggested operational practices and closed areas.  While 
the measures are voluntary their intent is to minimize: 
• 
bycatch (eg of seabirds and marine mammals); 
• 
catch of SBT smaller than 20 kg; 
• 
impacts on other domestic tuna fisheries, and 
• 
gear conflict among SBT longline vessels. 
Other voluntary measures employed by specific sectors include catch limits by area, changing 
areas when bird bycatch reaches a specific level, using multiple “tori” lines and longer lines than 
specified in regulations as the minimum, night-setting, and the use of pneumatic “bird-scaring” 
cannons. 
 
Regulatory measures 
New Zealand continues to impose the previously agreed national catch limit of 420 tonnes (whole 
weight). This catch limit is a competitive limit among all license holders. Regulations specify the 
annual catch limit and make it an offence to take SBT once the catch limit has been reached. The 
catch limit applies within and outside New Zealand fisheries waters for the “fishing year” which 
extends from 1 October to 30 September. In the few instances when the catch limit has been 
exceeded, it has been reduced in the following year by an equivalent amount. 
Until midway through the 2000–01 fishing season the SBT quota has applied to the catch of both 
southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) and northern Pacific bluefin tunas (formerly Thunnus 
thynnus, now recognized as Thunnus orientalis).  This additional quota restriction was removed 
late in the 2000–01 season when it was demonstrated that the northern Pacific bluefin could be 
readily distinguished from SBT in catches based on morphological characteristics. SBT landings 
 
2
reported for the first half of the fishing season did not distinguish between the two species and 
hence the landings in 2000–01 are likely to represent an under catch of the voluntary catch limit. 
3. 
Catch and Effort 
 
SBT catches are summarised by calendar year and fishing year (1 October to 30 September) in 
Table 1. The trend in catches over this period (see figure 1) shows the stabilization of catches 
around the catch limit imposed by New Zealand. Also shown in figure 1 are the landings reported 
for northern Pacific bluefin tuna. Longline effort has dominated the New Zealand fishery for the 
past decade and catches by handline and trolling are negligible components of the New Zealand 
SBT fishery.  Figure 2 shows the effort trend (in millions of hooks) for the longline fishery from 
1990 to 2000, the most recent complete year of processed data.  It is clear from this figure that the 
increase in effort is attributable to the growing number of New Zealand owned and operated 
longliners. The total number of longline hooks set each year now exceeds 7 million, much of this 
effort is directed at bigeye tuna. 
4. 
Annual fleet size and distribution 
 
The New Zealand longline fleet has broadened its area of operation and now fishes most areas of 
the east and west coasts of both the North and South Islands.  The total number of longliners 
fishing in 2000 (the most recent complete year) was 115 vessels, almost 70% of which were small 
to medium size (< 50 GRT). 
 
SBT target fishing by longline primarily occurs off the west coast of the South Island and off the 
North Island off East Cape and the Mahia peninsula.  SBT also comprises a significant bycatch in 
the bigeye target fishery in the Bay of Plenty. 
5. 
Historical fleet size and distribution 
 
The New Zealand SBT fishery began off the west coast of the South Island as a winter small boat 
handline and troll fishery in the early 1980s.  These methods have comprised only a minor 
component of the fishery over the past 10 years.  During this same period most longlining was 
conducted by foreign licensed longliners from Japan.  However, declining catch rates, shortened 
seasons of availability and reports of increased operating costs in the EEZ resulted in the foreign 
licensed fleet ceasing operations in the mid-1990s. Domestic longlining began in 1991 and has 
steadily increased up to at least 2000–01. 
6. 
Fisheries Monitoring 
 
Observer coverage  
Observer coverage has been 100% in the charter fleet for several years.  However, owing to the 
small size of domestic owned and operated vessels and frequent short trips, it has for been 
difficult for the Ministry of Fisheries (MFish) to place observers in this fleet.  As a consequence, 
observer coverage has typically been low.  However, a target of 10% observer coverage for this 
fleet and continued 100% coverage of the charter fleet has been agreed. In 2000–01 more than 
half of the total SBT catch was observed.  Realignment of MFish observer allocation should result 
in continued improvements in coverage of domestic owned and operated longline vessels.  
Observer coverage on vessels using handline or trolling has not been done since these methods are 
only occasionally used. 
 
RTMP coverage 
MFish operates an in-season catch monitoring system for SBT.  This system requires that on-
shore processing companies and freezer vessels (including all of the chartered fleet) report catch 
by  
e-mail or fax during the season to MFish.  Weekly reporting is required once 25% of the catch 
allocation is reached and daily reporting is required when 50% of the catch allocation has been 
 
3
reached. Reports are collated by MFish and if catch reports indicate that the limit is going to be 
met, all SBT permit holders are notified that the catch limit has been taken and that it would be an 
offence to take southern bluefin for the balance of the fishing year.  
 
Biological information 
Observers from the MFish Scientific Observer Programme are responsible for collecting a range 
of biological data on SBT and fish bycatch.  In 2000–01 otoliths were collected from 777 SBT 
and some tagged SBT were recovered by observers.  Otoliths are stored at NIWA and tag 
recovery data were provided to the tagging agency (CSIRO).  Tissue samples were collected from 
SBT, fish identified as northern Pacific bluefin tuna, southern bluefin tuna and from swordfish. In 
addition length, weight (both processed and whole weights) and sex are recorded regularly for 
SBT and all major fish bycatch species. 
7. 
Other factors 
 
Import/export statistics 
Statistics on the export of SBT are compiled by Customs and summarized by the Department of 
Statistics.  Export statistics are further summarized by the New Zealand Seafood Industry Council 
and maintained as a database for economic evaluations of New Zealand fisheries.   
 
Markets 
The only market for SBT caught in the EEZ is the Japanese sashimi market and all fish of suitable 
quality are exported.  Domestic consumption is negligible.   
 
Mitigation 
New Zealand regulations specify that all tuna longline vessels shall use seabird-scaring devices.  
The minimum standard for these, is the same as specified by CCAMLR for “tori lines”.  The 
domestic fishing industry has a voluntary code of practice advocating night setting for all tuna 
longlines and for the large tuna longline vessels a limit on total incidental mortality of “at risk” 
seabirds has been set.

Review of Taiwan SBT Fishery of 2000/01  
 
 
1. Introduction 
Southern bluefin tuna was caught by Taiwan partly by seasonal directed 
fishery and partly by albacore/bigeye fisheries as a by-catch.  Directed fishery 
was conducted mainly by longliners equipped with super cold freezers, fishing 
in the waters around 35°S.  The annual catches of 1999 and 2000 were 1,513 
mt and 1,638 mt, respectively.   
2. Operational Constraints on Effort 
To conserve the stock and to cooperate with CCSBT in freezing the SBT 
catch at the 1995 level as recommended by the Commission in 1995, Taiwan has 
adopted a voluntary catch limit of 1,450 mt since 1996 to control the increasing 
trend of SBT catch.  For the first implementation, this catch limit was managed 
at a five-year period, similar to the regulation approach used by ICCAT on some 
species.  The average catch of the first five-year period in 1996-2000 was 
1,387 mt. 
Every vessel that has caught SBT was required to report its SBT catches in 
weight and fishing location (Weekly Report) weekly to the fishery authorities 
from 1996 onward, to manage the total catch.  Trading information on SBT 
product was also collected through the subscription of certified weight reports 
of Shin Nippon Kentei Kaisha as from 1994.  The catch data from Weekly 
Reports were crosschecked with this trading information to reduce the 
possibility of non-reporting.   
To fulfill the requirement of the CCSBT Trade Information Scheme (TIS), 
measures for issuing SBT Statistical Document to fishermen have been 
implemented since June, 2000. 
 
2
3. Catch and Effort 
Taiwan has traditionally been fishing for SBT since 1970s.  Historically, 
annual catch of SBT (Table 1) was smaller than 250 mt during early 1980s, but, 
due to the increase of tuna fleet size, development of sashimi longliners, and 
expansion of fishing ground to the southern areas, the catches were increased 
thereafter.  From 1989 onward, the SBT catches increased to a tonnage of more 
than 1,000 mt, where drift net fishery accounted for about 1/4 of the catches in 
1989 and 1990.  After then, the SBT catches did not continue to increase, but 
rather fluctuate between 800 and 1,700 mt. 
These figures would be somewhat different from the Japanese Customs 
records, since the date recorded on the Customs records were landing date, but 
not catching date that used for these estimations.  From the monthly landing 
records at the Japanese market (Fig. 1), the peak landing period was from 
October to January/February next year.  There was another peak around April.  
In most cases, the SBT catches made during May-September season were landed 
at Japan during October-December, but the catches made after October were 
mostly landed after February next year.  The time may also be adjusted by the 
market price.  This makes the difference in the estimations of annual catch 
based on landing time and on catching time. 
4. Fleet Size and Distribution 
SBT caught by Taiwan was only by longline fishery since 1993, in the 
three oceans with the majority in the Indian Ocean.  According to the weekly 
reports and trading information, there were about 130-140 deep-sea longliners 
reported to have caught SBT, and most of them were operating in the Indian 
Ocean.  During the same period, there were altogether about 600 longliners 
operating the three oceans.  
The SBT was mainly caught in the waters of 20°S - 40°S, which was due 
more to the north than the traditionally known fishing grounds.  Seasonally, 
most of the catch was made during the austral winter season (June-September) 
in the Central Indian Ocean, and during the austral summer season 
(October-February) in the Southeast of Africa, of which about 75% of the 
overall catch of 2000 was made in the winter season.  SBT would also been 
caught outside the above two seasons (March-May), but the amount was small 
 
3
and the fishing grounds were scattered over both the southern Indian and 
Atlantic Oceans. 
5. Fisheries Monitoring 
For better understanding and monitoring the fishery, more efforts have 
been exerted since the implementation of TIS to collect more updated and 
detailed catch data.  Since this year, provision of daily records in the Weekly 
Report was required for obtaining a SBT statistical document. 
Since 1997, collaborative work with scientists from CSIRO on field visit 
and sampling of SBT catch were conducted in Mauritius, with the most recent 
one in September 2000.  The data collected in field has been cross-checked 
with official data by both sides in this February, and a paper on the results has 
been completed and reported at the CCSBT SAG2 meeting. 
6. Other Factors 
Mitigation on seabirds issue 
 
Taiwan is willing to cooperate with CCSBT through information exchange 
to improve understanding of the interaction between fishing operation and 
seabirds catch.  To reduce incidental seabirds mortality, fishermen were 
supported to use tori lines.  Education program was continuously made through 
Tuna Association to increase the understanding of the seabird issue among 
fishermen, including distribution of educational pamphlets in Chinese 
translation ‘Catching fish, not bird’ and training on application of tori lines.

ITEM 9 — STATEMENT BY AUSTRALIA 
� Thank you Mr Chairman. 
� I would like to make a short statement to outline Australia’s position in relation to 
this item. 
– I will cover both agenda items 9.1 (Total Allowable Catch) and 9.2 (National 
Allocation). 
� Delegates will recall, Mr Chairman, that throughout this meeting Australia has 
called for the setting of a total global catch and has pointed out that there is no case 
to increase SBT take or national allocations at this time. 
– We have also expressed concern about the increase in catch from non-members 
and have worked hard to encourage non-members to reduce their catch and to 
cooperate with the CCSBT. 
� Mr Chairman, we are working cooperatively as a Commission to address the non-
member issue and have made substantial progress at this meeting. 
� We have also achieved some progress on the preliminary total global catch level. 
– We have reached consensus on a maximum figure of 15 579 tonnes — the level 
of the 2000 catch as advised by the Scientific Committee. 
� But this is a hollow figure without any real meaning or substance in the absence of 
CCSBT members agreeing to binding national allocations. 
� Mr Chairman, I regret that we have not been able to reach agreement on national 
allocations of CCSBT members. 
� In light of advice from the Scientific Committee that there is a 50 per cent chance 
that the SBT spawning stock will be smaller in 2020 than it is today and that there is 
little to no chance that the SBT spawning stock will be rebuilt to 1980 levels by 
2020, Australia strongly believes that there is no case for any increase in allocations 
to members. 
� Australia’s clear position is that the national allocations of CCSBT members should 
be as follows. 
– Japan 
6065 tonnes 
– Australia

� Australia was prepared to countenance members being permitted to reconcile their 
national allocations against catch over a three year period within strict limits to 
 
 
provide some operational flexibility, but only if there was no increase above the 
total of each member’s allocation over the three year period. 
� I regret to say that this was not acceptable to all members. 
– One member continued to insist that it would not agree to anything other than an 
increase in its allocation. 
� In our view, it is simply unacceptable for CCSBT members to be seeking to increase 
their allocations in light of the advice of our Scientific Committee. 
– It is also untenable for CCSBT members to be insisting on increasing their own 
catches while expressing justifiable concern about increasing catches by others. 
� So we have no agreement on national allocations. 
� Let me assure delegates that Australia will ensure that its annual catch does not 
exceed 5265 tonnes. 
– We will do this on a voluntary basis. 
� Other members will need to consider their own positions, but I urge restraint and for 
there to be no increase above the figures I have mentioned. 
� If we are to entertain any hope of our sons and daughters continuing to fish for SBT, 
as Mr Hurry mentioned in his opening statement, then this is the least we can do. 
� As I mentioned a moment ago, the consensus we reached on a preliminary total 
global catch is a nonsense. 
– Not only do we have no control over non-members, but members have also been 
unable to agree on their own allocations. 
� So where does this leave us? 
– In failure, I regret to say. 
– The CCSBT has failed its first important test since resolution of the dispute with 
Japan over its Experimental Fishing Program. 
� We in the Australian delegation are extremely disappointed by this. 
– We have invested enormous energy, time and money to put past disputes behind 
us and to move forward on a cooperative basis. 
– We have invested heavily through commissioning independent scientists, 
through development of the Scientific Research Program, through the Stock 
Assessment Group and the Scientific Committee. 
– We have even agreed to fund the first year of the surface fishery tagging 
program off South Australia and Western Australia to enable this urgent 
research to commence. 
 
 
� As a delegation, we have invested enormous effort in trying to reach agreement on 
the key issues before us — in particular, the issue of global catch and national 
allocations. 
� We have failed here at Miyako, but not through any lack of commitment or goodwill 
on Australia’s part. 
– I am proud of the efforts of our delegation for the work they have put in. 
– We have brought a sensible, responsible approach on all issues, but we are not 
prepared to agree to bad outcomes. 
– It is better that we have no decisions than bad decisions. 
� So where to from here? 
– We will reflect on developments here at Miyako over the next few weeks. 
– We will not be making any rash decisions. 
– But we cannot go on like this. 
– The CCSBT must become a responsible and functioning regional fisheries 
management organisation if it is to make a meaningful contribution to the 
sustainability of SBT. 
– We had thought that we were on the point of the CCSBT becoming one of the 
world’s best and most responsible fisheries management organisations, but that 
accolade must wait for another day. 
� Mr Chairman, I would ask that these comments be recorded in the minutes of the 
meeting. 
� Thank you.

Statement by Japan on Agenda Item 9.2 
 
 
Japan is of the view that, while expressing its readiness to agree to set the global TAC at 
15,579 tonnes, national allocations for original three members should be increased 
bearing in mind the fact that the members had accepted the strict management measures 
to date. Also they had made significant achievements on non-member issues including 
Korea’s accession to the Convention and dramatic progress toward Taiwan’s 
membership of the Extended Commission with large amount of catch reduction. 
Assuming that 11,750 tonnes for the original three countries, 1,140 tonnes for Korea, 
1,140 tonnes for Taiwan, 500 tonnes for Indonesia and 50 tonnes for other non-members 
be allocated, a balance against the global TAC is 1,000 tonnes. Even if we leave the half 
of the balance as reserve for the stock recovery, 500 tonnes can be used for the 
allocation to the members. Japan believed that this idea would be very appropriate 
because both resource recovery and optimum utilization of SBT stock were considered. 
If members could reach a consensus to share this 500 tonnes by pro-rata base, Japan 
would join with that consensus. However, if not, Japan would decide its voluntary catch 
limit and conduct responsible fishing operations taking into account of the latest 
national allocation to Japan, this year’s voluntary catch limit and 500 tonnes which 
could be used for additional national allocations for the members. Japan will inform 
other members of its decision on the voluntary catch limit through diplomatic channels. 
 
Japan stressed that it could not accept the evaluation of Australia and New Zealand on 
this meeting as “failure”. Considering such progresses as the Korean accession to the 
Convention, Taiwan’s statement for further cooperation to the Commission, further 
actions taken against Indonesia, Cambodia, Equator Guinea and Honduras, and virtual 
agreement on setting the global TAC of 15,579 tonnes, Japan believes that this Annual 
Meeting should be evaluated as more successful than any other past meeting. 
 
 
Attachment N-3 
 
 
Korea’s Statement on Agenda item 9 
 
 
Korea respects the importance of maintaining both the SBT stock and the fishing 
infrastructure it supports. Regarding the failure to reach consensus, it believes more 
time is required to reach full cooperation in the Commission. In addition, Korea will 
respect its negotiated and agreed catch level with CCSBT, regarding national allocation. 
 
Attachment N-4 
 
 
New Zealand Statement 
 
 
Following the dispute resolution proceedings New Zealand was looking forward to 
working in good faith within a functional Commission. 
 
Mr Chairman, there was a commitment by all Parties to develop a robust Scientific 
Research Programme and to act on the advice provided by science. 
 
The Scientific Committee Report, which was adopted by all members of the 
Commission, makes it clear that at current catch levels there is little chance that the 
Southern bluefin tuna spawning stock biomass will be rebuilt to 1980 levels by 2020. 
The logical and responsible conclusion we draw from this is that catch levels must be 
reduced in order to achieve our stated management objectives. In this regard we view 
any increase in catch levels by members of the Commission as irresponsible. 
 
We had high hopes that Miyako would provide a breakthrough and lead to an agreed 
TAC by the Commission. In our view the inability to deliver on this objective leads us 
to consider this meeting a failure. We are also very concerned with the message this 
outcome will send to non-members regarding the integrity of this Commission. 
 
New Zealand will on a voluntary basis maintain its national allocation at 420 tonnes, the 
level last agreed by the Commission
