Report of the Extended Commission of the 
Seventeenth Annual Meeting of the Commission 
11-14 October 2010 
Taipei, Taiwan 
 
Agenda Item 1. 
Opening of meeting 
1.1. 
 Confirmation of Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended Commission 
of the Seventeenth Meeting of the Commission 
1. Mr Tzu-Yaw Tsay (Taiwan) was confirmed as the Chair of the Extended 
Commission of CCSBT 17. 
2. The Chair opened the meeting. 
3. The Chair introduced Dr. Yu-Tsai Huang, Deputy Minister of the Council of 
Agriculture who welcomed participants and made an opening address to the 
meeting. 
 
1.2.  
Adoption of agenda 
4. The agenda was adopted and is included at Attachment 1.  
5. Participants were introduced and the list of meeting participants is included at 
Attachment 2. 
6. The list of documents submitted to the meeting is at Attachment 3. 
 
1.3.  
Opening statements 
1.3.1 Members 
7. Opening statements by Members of the Extended Commission are at Attachment 
4. 
 
1.3.2 Cooperating Non-Members 
8. Opening statements by Cooperating Non-Members (CNMs) are at Attachment 5. 
 
1.3.3 Observers 
9. Opening Statements by Observers are at Attachment 6. 
 
Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
10. Members noted the report from the Secretariat (CCSBT-EC/1010/04), and agreed 
that the Humane Society International would be granted long term observer status 
to meetings of the Compliance Committee. 
1 
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
11. The Executive Secretary provided an outline of the financial matters that the 
meeting would need to consider, including the revised budget for 2010 (CCSBT-
EC/1010/05), and the proposed budget for 2011 (CCSBT-EC/1010/06).  Detailed 
consideration of these papers was referred to the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC). 
12. The FAC was convened to consider: 
• the revised budget for 2010; 
• the proposed budget for 2011; and 
• other finance and administration issues. 
13. Ms. Trysh Stone (Australia) was nominated to Chair the FAC. 
 
3.1.  
Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
14. The Chair of the FAC reported on the outcome of the FAC deliberations.  This 
included recommending a revised budget for 2010, a proposed budget for 2011 
and noted that due to a carryover of funds saved from 2010, the proposed 2011 
budget was an increase of only 1.1% over the 2010 budget. 
15. It was also noted that there was support for providing additional resources for 
compliance analyses.  Some Members supported in principle the addition of one 
staff member to the Secretariat to work as a Compliance Officer. However, some 
Members advised that they were not able to approve funding for an additional 
staff member in 2011, and the FAC requested that Members be prepared to 
possibly approve such funding at CCSBT 18. 
 
3.2.  
Discussion on Finance Issues and adoption of budget 
16. The FAC was unable to agree upon sharing the costs of the Aerial Survey among 
Members, but thanked Australia for its continuing work, noting that the results of 
the Aerial Survey were very important for the work of the ESC. 
17. Australia suggested that in order for Members to make a more informed decision 
about ongoing funding for aerial survey, that Members should present estimates of 
their funding contributions to CCSBT science, compliance and provision of 
commercial catch data to FAC in 2011.   
18. The Extended Commission adopted the report of the FAC and all of its 
recommendations, including the revised budget for 2010 and the proposed budget 
for 2011.  The report of the FAC is at Attachment 7. 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries and ERS Interactions 
2 
19. The meeting agreed that the CCSBT’s template for national reports should be 
modified to include a report on SBT imports and their domestic market for SBT, 
noting that some Members and CNMs do not currently have such a market. 
 
4.1. 
 Monitoring of Japanese wholesale markets and Australian SBT 
farming operations 
20. The meeting noted that Members (particularly Japan and Australia) had 
undertaken to work intersessionally to develop methods of market analyses based 
on CDS data, trade data, public data from the markets and any other relevant data 
available, and to cooperatively progress joint market studies and monitoring. 
21. The meeting thanked Australia for its continued work in development of 
commercial trials of Stereo Video monitoring, and encouraged Australia to 
provide the results of the trial to the meetings in 2011. 
 
4.2.  
Recreational Fisheries 
22. The meeting agreed that there was still a concern over the lack of suitable 
recreational catch data, and noted Members’ continuing commitment to provide 
available estimates of recreational catch and to improve accuracy of such 
estimates. 
23. It was noted that the extent of recreational fisheries was still somewhat unknown 
and as a consequence, the impact of this on the overall SBT fishery was also 
unknown. 
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
24. The Chair of the Compliance Committee presented the report of the Compliance 
Committee meeting and provided the following personal observations in relation 
to the meeting: 
• It was disappointing that the European Union was not present at the meeting to 
answer questions about its National Report and the lack of a Compliance 
Action Plan. 
• Positive aspects of the meeting included: 
o Members’ in-depth questioning of each other on their National Reports and 
Compliance Action Plans. The questions provided a positive mechanism to 
produce valuable information and holding Members accountable for 
meeting their compliance obligations. 
o Good progress made in identifying compliance risks. The intersessional 
Compliance Risk Assessment working group provided valuable information, 
as did the Secretariat’s Compliance with Measures report and associated 
summary tables. 
o Good progress had been made in fine tuning the Catch Documentation 
System (CDS). While still in the early stages of implementation, the CDS is 
proving to be effective, and is consistent with world’s best practice. 
• Negative aspects of the meeting included: 
3 
o The Compliance Committee developed good processes to identify problems 
and risks, but had not moved into problem solving mode and did not come 
up with solutions to the problems or measures to mitigate the identified 
compliance risks. 
o There were some serious issues of non-compliance. These are: 
a) There were some circumstances where the CDS was poorly 
implemented. In other circumstances Members were using different 
standards and definitions within the CDS, causing inequities in 
compliance effort and associated costs. 
b) Transhipment observers are unable to act as validators or to adequately 
identify or quantify SBT during transhipments. This raised questions as 
to the effectiveness of the transhipment resolution as a whole. 
c) While considerable progress had been made with monitoring in the 
farm sector, there was still some concern about the effectiveness of 
existing monitoring systems. 
d) Port States had not been provided with sufficient information in order 
to deliver on their obligations. 
25. The meeting noted and welcomed the frank remarks from the Chair of the 
Compliance Committee.  The meeting also expressed appreciation to South 
Africa for its efforts as a port State in relation to SBT compliance issues. 
26. The report of the Compliance Committee meeting, including its recommendations, 
was adopted and is at Attachment 8. 
27. The Extended Commission (EC) agreed that a Compliance Plan should be 
developed as recommended by the Compliance Committee and that the plan 
should place special emphasis on managing the following compliance risks: 
• Effective implementation of the CDS, with special emphasis on physical 
validation and appropriate verification. 
• Improvement to the transhipment monitoring program, including prior 
notification of SBT transhipments with observer deployment requests and 
training of all observers to enable detection of SBT transhipments even when 
SBT is not declared. 
• SBT being landed as other (non SBT) species. 
• Expansion of markets for SBT. 
• Monitoring of catches from the farm sector. 
• Non-reporting of bycatch and discards against national allocations. 
• Better systems to provide information to port States to assist port States to 
provide improved monitoring of SBT activities. 
28. The EC noted that in addition to including the above items in the Compliance 
Plan, it expected Members and Cooperating Non-Members to immediately 
commence addressing some of the identified compliance risks and not wait for 
finalisation of the plan. 
29. The EC also agreed that to ensure effective implementation of compliance 
measures, five draft compliance policy statements should be developed for 
4 
consideration at the next meeting of the Compliance Committee.  These are 
policy statements to: 
• Clearly specify Members’ compliance obligations.   Each obligation (such as 
VMS) should be clearly stated and be accompanied by a standard that clearly 
specified what needed to be achieved.  Certain resolutions of the EC, such as 
the CDS, would be broken down into several obligations. 
• Obtain improved reporting by Members against their compliance obligations.  
This would specify the reporting required against each obligation. 
• Provide for independent auditing of Members’ compliance systems.  This is to 
verify compliance with the stated obligations. 
• Specify sanctions for non-compliance against the obligations and/or CCSBT’s 
management and conservation measures.  This could include market measures, 
allocation reductions and penalties. 
• Provide for the sharing of compliance information. 
30. The meeting agreed that the Compliance Policies should be developed by the 
Executive Secretary and CC Chair according to the following process: 
• The drafts will be circulated for comments; 
• A second draft will be prepared and circulated to the SFMWG; and 
• A third draft incorporating the SFMWG’s comments will be sent to the CC.  
31. A new reporting format would be agreed at the SFMWG and provided to 
Members to use in their preparation of national reports to the Commission in 
2011. 
32. The meeting confirmed that the Compliance Committee should deal with all 
compliance issues, including those for ecologically related species. 
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Strategy and Fisheries Management 
Working Group 
33. The Chair of the SFMWG presented the report of the 2nd meeting of the SFMWG, 
which is at Attachment 9 and is summarised in paper CCSBT-EC/1010/09. The 
EC adopted the report of the SFMWG, noting that further discussions on the 
strategic plan recommended by the SFMWG for adoption at CCSBT 17 would 
occur under agenda item 8. 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Report from the 2010 Joint Tuna RFMO workshops 
34. The Executive Secretary presented the paper CCSBT-EC/1010/10 which provided 
a summary of the reports from the 4 joint tuna RFMO workshops held during 
2010, noting there were a total of 75 recommendations from the workshops for 
consideration by the Extended Commission. 
35. The meeting noted that the recommendations in the paper had been agreed in 
discussion of other agenda items. 
5 
36. Japan informed the meeting that one of the important outcomes of the joint tuna 
workshop relating to MCS measures was that each RFMO will expand Catch 
Documentation Systems to include other species and there may be a need to 
harmonise systems. 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Adoption and Implementation of the CCSBT Strategic Plan 
8.1.  
Adoption of the Plan 
37.  The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/1010/11 in relation to 
adoption of the strategic plan. The meeting noted, that due to the absence of 
appropriate representatives from the European Union, it could not consider Goal 
11 which includes ensuring that Regional Economic Integration Organisations 
are engaged in the cooperative management of SBT. 
38.  Due to a request to make changes to the strategic plan, there was no consensus to 
adopt the plan. Members were requested to submit changes and additions to the 
Secretariat by the end of the year. The Secretariat will incorporate such changes 
and circulate the modified plan to the SFMWG meeting for consideration and 
then for adoption at CCSBT 18. So that this process does not delay action 
relating to strategies of the plan it was agreed that strategies identified in the 
annotated agenda for consideration during 2010 be discussed at this meeting. 
 
8.2.  
Implementation of the Plan 
39. The meeting made the following  recommendations relating to the strategies 
specified above: 
• The limit below which stock size should not be allowed to fall was agreed to 
be generally the current level of the spawning stock biomass and the means of 
examining this and developing other appropriate reference points could be 
considered in the context of MP adoption including the metarule process.  
• The Terms of Reference of the Compliance Committee will be amended as 
shown in Attachment 10 in order to reinforce the CC’s role in relation to 
obtaining accurate data on all fisheries. 
• Development of a framework to provide for underfishing and response to 
overfishing would be considered as part of the rules for a 3 year block quota 
under the MP during the next SFMWG meeting. 
• The Secretariat should develop an active vessel list based on information from 
the CDS and publish the list on its website. In addition, templates developed 
for the Compliance Committee should include questions to Flag States relating 
to issues of overcapacity. 
• A Chair with appropriate expertise should be appointed to the ERSWG by the 
Extended Commission for a term of at least two meetings of the ERSWG.  The 
appointment of the Chair should be undertaken intersessionally and in time for 
the next meeting of the ERSWG and to represent CCSBT in the technical 
working group on ERS planned under the Kobe process. 
• Consideration needs to be given to development of an ERS data exchange 
including consideration of data submissions and protocols in advance of the 
6 
meeting. The next meeting of the ERSWG will be tasked to develop standards 
for data collection. 
• The ESC should be advised that the Extended Commission is seeking to avoid 
unnecessary expenditure. In that context the ESC should be asked to make a 
recommendation in relation to the number of panel Members required for ESC 
meetings and time required to hold its meetings once development and 
implementation of the MP is complete.  
• The 2011 Compliance Committee meeting should be extended to 3 days, with 
a rest day between it and the Extended Commission meeting. 
• Specified Members would act as the CCSBT observers at RFMO meetings of 
interest (e.g. tuna RFMOs and CCAMLR) and the observer Members to 
provide reports back to the CCSBT on matters of relevance in order to 
improve coordination with other RFMO’s. The following Members were 
nominated to observe the next series of RFMO’s annual meetings: 
o New Zealand to observe meetings of  WCPFC 
o Australia to observe meetings of  CCAMLR 
o Japan to observe meetings of  IOTC and ICCAT 
o Taiwan to observe meetings of IATTC 
• To aid in decision making, documents should be developed for any issues or 
proposals intended to be made at meetings and the documents should be 
submitted at least 4 weeks in advance of the meeting. 
• The Extended Commission will provide funding for consultancies, on a case 
by case basis, to resource the Secretariat to conduct specified tasks. 
• To provide easy reference for Members, intersessional requests to Members 
from the Secretariat should be numbered and placed on the private area of the 
CCSBT website and include specification of required timeframes. 
• To clearly document rationale for decisions that differ from scientific advice, 
the Rules of Procedure of the Commission will be modified to require 
inclusion of such rationale in the report of the meeting. The revised Rules of 
Procedure are at Attachment 11. 
• The Rules of Procedure shall also be amended to task the Scientific 
Committee to incorporate advice consistent with a precautionary approach: 
Rule 8 Bis (SCIENTIFIC ADVICE) 
“1.The Scientific Committee shall incorporate advice consistent with 
the precautionary approach in its advice to the Commission”.   
• The meeting further agreed that the ESC in future shall be asked to consider 
how an ecosystem approach might be incorporated into its advice to the 
Commission. 
• Consideration of establishing procedures for penalties and incentives to 
promote compliance was deferred to discussion of the draft compliance policy 
statement that is to be developed on this matter. 
•  Developing Country Members and Cooperating non-Members should provide 
table of areas where they require assistance for consideration by the Extended 
Commission. 
7 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
40. The Chair of the ESC presented the report of the ESC which is at Attachment 12. 
41. Following an extensive question and answer session relating to issues arising 
from the report of the ESC, and noting the extensive work undertaken in 
development of a Management Procedure, the Extended Commission adopted the 
report of the ESC.  However, the Extended Commission may need to consider 
changes to the ESC’s work plan including any future work that may be 
undertaken for further examination of an MP, and other information requests 
developed at this meeting. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Adoption of a Management Procedure 
42.  The meeting was presented with options for three different management 
procedures that had been developed by the ESC, as outlined in CCSBT-
EC/1010/13. Each MP was pre-programmed to achieve the same target 
rebuilding levels, but that there were significant differences in the behaviour of 
the MPs. 
43. It was noted that the advice from the ESC indicated that stocks were at a very low 
level (approximately 5% of the unfished spawning biomass). Members advised 
that they were committed to adopting an MP for implementation in 2012 to 
rebuild the SBT stock. 
44. The meeting agreed that taking a precautionary approach was important. Some 
Members also noted that there needed to be a balance between reductions in TAC, 
and the impact on industry, which was the purpose of the MP. 
45. It was further noted that the EC was required to make decisions on a number of 
important items in relation to the MP, including: 
• Which of the MPs to adopt; 
• The timeframe required to reach the interim rebuilding target of 20% of the 
unfished spawning biomass; 
• The minimum acceptable rebuilding probability; 
• The maximum size of TAC changes; 
• The minimum size of TAC changes; 
• The frequency of TAC setting; and 
• The time lag between calculation and implementation of the TAC. 
46. At CCSBT17, the Extended Commission re-affirmed its commitment to adopt a 
Management Procedure. 
47. The Extended Commission acknowledged and thanked the Extended Scientific 
Committee for its work to date and agreed certain parameters for an MP 
including tuning to a 70% probability of achieving the interim rebuilding target; 
setting 3-year TACs; and a minimum TAC change of 100t; but some Members 
8 
considered that further information was required, including advice on the effect 
of an initial large reduction in the TAC before implementation of the 
management procedure.    
48. The Extended Commission accepts that this will require an extra commitment of 
time in 2011 to consider further information and reach consensus decisions.  
Decisions will be required on, inter alia, which Management Procedure to adopt; 
the parameters associated with the management procedure (including the 
rebuilding timeframe and the maximum allowable changes in TAC); and when 
the management procedure is applied.   
49. The Extended Commission noted that in the event consensus could not be 
reached on adoption of a Management Procedure, an existing decision of CCSBT 
16 would see the TAC for 2012 set at 5,000 – 6,000t. 
50. In order to assist decisions to be made at CCSBT 18 on the Management 
Procedure to adopt and the quantum and timing of reductions in catch, the 
following process will apply: 
• Intersessional evaluation of the questions outlined in Attachment 13 by 
Members of the Extended Scientific Committee to present preliminary results 
to the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group meeting 
• Bring forward data exchange requirements (apart from aerial survey data) 
• A 4 day Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group meeting in Japan 
in March/April 2011 to consider compliance, allocation and strategic plan 
issues 
• Bring forward and extend to 10 days the meeting of the Extended Scientific 
Committee in Indonesia (encompassing a meeting of the Operating Model and 
Management Procedure Working Group (the ‘Seattle meeting’) previously 
scheduled) to enable evaluation of questions outlined in Attachment 13; a new 
stock assessment; and the use of the new stock assessment in candidate 
management procedures: late July 2011 
• A 3 day special meeting of the Extended Commission to evaluate and adopt a 
management procedure in Australia: late August 2011 
• CCSBT 18 in Indonesia: 6-8 October (Compliance Committee) and 10-13 
October 2011 (Extended Commission) 
51. It was noted that the additional meeting time in the above process was likely to 
cause an over-expenditure in the approved budget for 2011, but that this can be 
funded through the Extended Commission’s cash reserves. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
11.1. 
TAC determination 
52. The meeting agreed that the current TAC allocation decided at CCSBT 16 was 
considered a 2 year total TAC, and could be distributed across the two year period, 
with unused catch from the first year carried forward to the second year.  
53. The meeting noted that the TAC under an MP could be considered either as 3 
single year fixed allocations or as a 3 year block in which quota can be distributed 
9 
between years provided that tightly controlled rules are agreed and in place prior 
to this occurring.  
54. The meeting also agreed that there would be no carryover of unused quota from 
2010/11 to 2012.  
55. There was no agreement on a TAC for 2012. Most Members agreed to continue 
the current TAC in accordance with advice from the ESC for a TAC in 2012 if a 1 
year time lag is adopted. Japan was unable to agree to a specific TAC for 2012 as 
it considered this could be dependent on decisions in relation to an MP and in 
particular whether additional reductions are required. 
 
11.2. 
Research Mortality Allowance 
56. The Extended Commission considered paper CCSBT-EC/1010/14 and approved 
Japan’s request of 1t of RMA for a recruitment monitoring survey in 2010/2011. 
 
11.3. 
Allocation of TAC 
57.  It was noted that defined rules about allocation of the TAC will be required under 
the MP. 
58. Japan remarked that its 5 year period of reduced allocation finishes after 2011 and 
that it will want to revert to its nominal catch level, but is ready to consider further 
reductions with other Members as necessary to recover the stock. It also 
emphasised the need for serious compliance efforts by all the Members. 
59. South Africa advised it was in the process of ratifying Membership with CCSBT 
and that it hoped to have this completed during 2011. South Africa further advised 
that it would be seeking an equitable allocation in this process. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Cooperating Non-Members 
60. The Executive Secretary presented CCSBT-EC/1010/15, detailing the 
performance of Cooperating Non-Members (CNMs). 
61. Concerns were raised in relation to the lack of reporting from the European Union, 
in particular: 
• Failure to provide a Compliance Action Plan 
• No information on effort, transhipments, logbooks or observers in the national 
report 
• Failure to provide monthly catch reports for the third consecutive year. 
• Failure to provide information on how catch was acquitted against quota given 
the infrequency of catch reporting and the fact that quota was not allocated to 
individual vessels.  
• Non attendance at the meeting of the Compliance Committee. 
10 
62. The European Union advised that its fishery was not targeting SBT but consisted 
entirely of by-catch and that the current regulations resulted in a lag in reporting 
timeframes and subsequently obligations relating to Monthly Catch Reporting 
could not be previously met. It further advised that these regulations were under 
review and they hoped to soon be able to meet this CCSBT obligation. 
63. The meeting agreed to continue the European Union’s status as a Cooperating 
Non-Member, and encouraged the European Union to improve its reporting and 
provide appropriate representation to both the Commission and Compliance 
Committee meetings in future years. 
64. The meeting thanked the Philippines for its efforts to resolve issues relating to 
reporting, verification and compliance in its SBT fishery. The Extended 
Commission agreed to continue the Philippines status as a Cooperating Non-
Member. 
65. The Extended Commission appreciated South Africa’s efforts as a port state and 
noted that South Africa had advised it was in the process of ratifying full 
membership to the CCSBT. The meeting agreed to continue South Africa’s status 
as a Cooperating Non-Member. 
66. It was agreed that the TAC Allocations to Cooperating Non-Members for 2011 
would remain at the same levels as in 2010. 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
67. The meeting considered paper CCSBT-EC/1010/16, which outlined CCSBT’s 
relationship with Non-Members, noting that in response to last year’s requests, a 
reply had been received from the USA in relation to cooperation with the CDS. 
No response has yet been received from China, and the Secretariat will again write 
to China to seek its cooperation. Members were also encouraged to seek 
cooperation through bilateral means.  
68. The meeting requested that the Executive Secretary should write to any non 
members involved in SBT fishing or trade to seek cooperation with the Extended 
Commission. 
69. Following a request by South Africa, the meeting also agreed that the Executive 
Secretary should write to port states that may be involved with SBT fisheries to 
seek cooperation. These would include Namibia and Mauritius. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Activities with other organisations 
14.1  
Relationship with CCAMLR 
70. The Executive Secretary presented CCSBT-EC/1010/17 which included an update 
on the limited intersessional progress in relation to the relationship with the 
Commission for Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), 
and with other organisations. 
71. The meeting noted that Australia and New Zealand were still undergoing 
consultations on this matter.  
11 
72. Australia urged all Members not to fish in the CCAMLR area for SBT at this time 
(Attachment 14) 
 
14.2. 
 Relationship with ACAP 
73. Attachment C of CCSBT-EC/1010/17 detailed a draft Arrangement between 
CCSBT and the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels 
(ACAP).  
74. Although some Members considered an Arrangement would be beneficial to allow 
sharing of information and expertise, no consensus was reached on entering into 
an Arrangement with ACAP. However the meeting noted that an Arrangement 
might be possible once progress on ERS matters starts to be made within the next 
ERSWG. 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Governance – Role of Chair and Commissioners 
75. The meeting considered CCSBT-EC/1010/18 in relation to appointing a Chair and 
Vice-Chair of the Commission for a 2 year period, with a possibility of re-
appointment for a further 2 years. 
76. No consensus was reached on this matter. 
 
Agenda Item 16. 
Confidentiality of Data and Documents 
16.1. 
Data Confidentiality Rules and Arrangements 
77. The meeting agreed the Rules and Procedures for the Protection, Access to, and 
Dissemination of Data Compiled by the CCSBT for immediate application. These 
rules are provided at Attachment 15.  Three paragraphs of the rules (5c, 21 and 
22) are not to be implemented at the present time but will be discussed before 
CCSBT 18.   
 
16.2. 
Confidentiality of documents from previous years 
78. Some Members emphasised the importance of transparency. There was no 
consensus to change the current arrangements relating to the confidentiality of the 
Japanese Market Review or the Australian Farm Review, along with any past and 
future documents that refer to these two reports. 
 
16.3. 
Confidentiality of reports and documents from 2010 
79. The Extended Commission noted that with exception of Attachment A of paper 
CCSBT-ESC/1009/04 and CCSBT-ESC/1009/09, papers CCSBT-ESC/1009/31 
and CCSBT-ESC/1009/32, CCSBT-CC/1010/BGD03 and CCSBT-
CC/1010/BGD05 the reports of meetings and documents submitted to the 
meetings under the jurisdiction of CCSBT 17 would be made publicly available. 
 
12 
Agenda Item 17. 
Other business 
80. The meeting noted that advancements were being made in regard to development 
of hatchery raised SBT. Members were encouraged, where possible, to provide 
further information on developments to future meetings of the Extended Scientific 
Committee. 
81. The meeting noted that the draft Resolution provided by Australia on the 
Provision of Data had not been agreed, but would be included at Attachment 16, 
for possible discussion at future meetings including the SFMWG. 
82. Members agreed to provide comments on Australia’s proposal to consider 
development of a Regional Observer Program in time for discussion at the next 
meeting of the SFMWG. 
83. Japan’s draft resolutions on an Emergency Rule for TAC adjustment, and 
Reduction of Juvenile Mortality are provided at Attachments 17 and 18. 
84. The Extended Commission noted that the Executive Secretary’s contract expires 
immediately after CCSBT 18.  The Extended Commission advised that it would 
be happy for the Executive Secretary’s contract to be renewed and commended 
him for his performance to date.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Nin hao and good morning. 
First, let me thank the honorable Deputy Minister for his warm welcome to the city. For most 
of my delegation it is our first time to Taipei and we are looking forward to opportunities to 
explore the city. 
As we begin our work this week it is important to reflect on the outcomes from our last 
meeting, on the beautiful island of Jeju.  Most crucial of these outcomes was our collective 
commitment to sustained action to rebuild the southern bluefin tuna spawning stock to the 
interim target level of 20 per cent of its unfished biomass.  For Australia, this was an 
extremely positive outcome and reflected members’ recognition that the long-term 
profitability of our respective industries is dependent on the health of the southern bluefin 
tuna stock. 
At our 2009 meeting, we committed in Resolution on the Total Allowable Catch and Future 
Management of Southern Bluefin Tuna to finalise and adopt a management procedure at our 
2010 annual meeting.  In Australia’s view, this is the most important issue we have before us 
this week. 
As we begin our work to finalise the management procedure, it may be useful for other 
members if I provide some initial indications of Australia’s approach to these discussions and 
what will guide our views.  First, for our domestic fisheries, Australia’s Commonwealth 
Fisheries Harvest Strategy Policy requires a high degree of confidence that management 
measures for depleted fish stocks will enable those stocks to recover. For fish stocks that are 
severely depleted, such as southern bluefin tuna, we require management measures with a 
greater degree of precaution.  With respect to the Extended Commission’s consideration of 
the management procedure we wish to see a management procedure that is capable of 
responding quickly to positive signals on the status of the stock as well as ensuring that steps 
are taken to guard against further declines. Secondly, Australia has an important domestic 
fishery for southern bluefin tuna, based in the town of Port Lincoln. The industry is an 
important local employer and makes a significant contribution to the regional economy and 
the community. It is an industry that is dependent on southern bluefin tuna swimming 
through the Great Australian Bight; the industry is not mobile and cannot shift its effort onto 
bigeye tuna, yellowfin, albacore or other species. Of course, all of us have the needs of our 
industries to consider and Australia will seek to work with other members to explore ways in 
which these needs can be recognized in the design of the management procedure within our 
agreed objective of rebuilding the southern bluefin tuna stock. 
Rebuilding the southern bluefin tuna spawning stock is a long-term commitment and will 
have important consequences for our industries. Because of this, it is crucial that all of us 
have a high level of confidence in the scientific processes that underpin our decisions on 
global total allowable catch levels.  For this reason, Australia is has tabled draft resolution on 
the Provision of Fisheries-Dependent Data to Support the Scientific Assessment of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna and Ecologically Related Species. This resolution provides for the submission 
of fine-scale catch and effort data; data that will strengthen both the stock assessment process 
and the management procedure.  Australia has also proposed the development of a Regional 
Observer Program; such a program will strengthen our confidence both in the catch and effort 
data and that all members are complying with their national allocations. We look forward to 
discussing the details of these proposals further with other members this week. 
Chair, all of us are aware that there has been intense international scrutiny and criticism of 
the performance of RFMOs, particularly in taking effective measures to address overfished 
tuna stocks.  This criticism will only continue and grow if we do not meet the challenge we 
have set ourselves of adopting a robust management procedure at our meeting this week.  
Having said this, Australia is confident that the mutual goodwill and commitment to 
rebuilding southern bluefin tuna from our 2009 meeting will carry over to our discussions this 
week and that we will reach consensus on the management procedure.  To do so would be a 
significant achievement for this Commission. 
I look forward to working with other Commissioners, delegates and observers to advance our 
collective objectives and reach a successful conclusion to our meeting. 
 
Xie xie and thank you.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Good Morning Mr. Chair, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,  
 
First of all, I would like to welcome all of you to Taiwan and it is our great pleasure to 
host this meeting. I would also like to extend our thanks to the Executive Secretary, 
Mr. Robert Kennedy and the staffs of the Secretariat for their hard work in arranging 
this meeting.  
 
At the 16th annual meeting of CCSBT, members agreed to finalize management 
procedure (MP) in this meeting and implemented in 2011 as the basis for setting 
global total allowable catch (TAC) for 2012 and beyond. In order to reach the interim 
rebuilding target of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) in the timeframe as the guideline set 
by the second Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group Meeting, future 
TAC might need to be reduced in accordance with the candidate MP projection 
selected by the September 2010 meeting of the Extended Scientific Committee. For 
the need of adjustment and adaption for industries, the range for TAC reduction at the 
initial stage should be appropriately considered.  
 
Besides, the implementation of monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) measures, 
such as catch documentation scheme (CDS), vessel monitoring system (VMS), 
transshipment program and scientific observer program etc., is very critical for 
achieving the objective of the stock rebuilding. According to the Resolution on the 
Implementation of a CCSBT Catch Documentation Scheme, with the exception of 
surface fishery, all SBT shall be tagged, measured individual weight and length, 
recorded the fishing statistical area at the moment of catch, and monitored 
transshipment before landing. This will be a useful measure to combat and deter IUU 
fishing. However, there remains room for improvement in terms of implementation. 
We hope we can find solution in this regards during the meeting.  
  
In addition, assisting developing countries with capacity building for compliance with 
the conservation and management measures adopted by the CCSBT is also very 
crucial to achieve the aim. 
 
We look forward to having constructive discussion with all members and cooperating 
non-members over the next few days and producing fruitful results from the meeting. 
 
Although the agenda is pretty tight for this meeting, I still hope you have opportunity 
to go around the city and enjoy the cuisine of Taiwan. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen. 
It is my great pleasure to be here to participate in the 17th Annual Meeting of the Extended 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and let me first extend my 
sincere appreciation and gratitude to the Fishing Entity of Taiwan for hosting the current 
session and to officers of the Secretariat who made enormous effort to hold this meeting 
You may have observed that in this current session, it is the third occasion for Indonesia to 
participate in the important meeting as a member of the Commission since early of 2008. As a 
member, Indonesia has been taking a lot of efforts to ensure the sustainability management of 
SBT through complying with CCSBT resolutions. Even though there are a lot of obstacles 
among others due to the educational background of fishermen and wide range of vessels size 
that authorized to catch fish, but hand by hand with private sectors represented by 
Associations of Tuna Fishing Companies, we have shown our great concern and active 
participation in the management conservation and utilization of SBT resources. 
In order to support the strengthening of SBT data collection, we have implemented fishing 
logbook which were in accordance with the results in collaborative workshop undertaken  in 
Jakarta last year sponsored by the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries of the Republic of 
Indonesia and OFCF Japan, also supported by IOTC, WCPFC, CCSBT and our tuna long-line 
fishing industries. I herewith kindly also inform to this meeting that Indonesia has a new 
regulation on the implementation of fishing log-book program by Minister of Marine Affairs 
and Fisheries Regulation No. PER.18/MEN/2010. We do believe, trough this regulation, 
Indonesia data collection will be greatly improved and will be able to strengthen the 
implementation of CCSBT-CDS system. In the better implementation of this regulation, we 
will apply the principle “No Log Book, No License”. We do hope that it is part of our 
commitment to comply with the RFMOs measures and resolutions to maintain our sustainable 
Tuna resources through fisheries management improvement. 
However, current situation indicates that future of southern bluefin tuna fisheries seems not so 
bright and call for cooperative effort among members in controlling fishing effort that have 
been echoed in various meetings of the Commission.  
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen, 
As a part of Indonesia commitment to support the Commission, we officially ready to become 
the host and chairman for the 18th CCSBT annual commission meeting in 2011 that will be 
held in Bali.  
Finally, I would like to end this opening statement by wishing that we could join hands 
together to bring out fruitful and satisfaction for our future sustainable development of SBT 
fisheries management and sustainable utilization in consistency with CCRF.  
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Japan 
 
On behalf of the Japan delegation I would like to express our sincere gratitude to 
Taiwan for hosting the CCSBT meeting. I am happy to attend the Extended Commission 
of the Seventeenth Annual Meeting of the Commission. 
 
I have engaged in the conservation and management of tuna stocks for a long time.  
My carrier in the Fisheries Agency is now reaching at the final stage, so I would like to 
take this opportunity to review the history of SBT fishery. 
 
History of SBT fishery is long. Japanese fishers started catching SBT in 1960s. At that 
time, SBT was used as a material for processing cans and sausages, not for sashimi. In 
1970s, development of ultra low temperature freezer let us possible to use SBT as 
sashimi.  
 
In 1980s, Japan, New Zealand and Australia commenced the trilateral discussion as the 
stock seemed to decline. At that time one of the most important issues was to minimize 
a large amount of catches of juvenile SBT by Australian purse seine, as well as 
conservation and recovery of the stock. Although we kept negotiating seriously, it was 
very difficult to reach satisfied outcomes. Consequently, Australia proposed a 
moratorium of SBT fishery. Through the hard working process, we reached to the 
conclusion that conservation measures should be taken in order to utilize SBT 
sustainably. Then, CCSBT was established in 1993. Unfortunately, I was in charge of 
SBT issues at that time I was kept staying for seven weeks in Canberra to conclude the 
process. 
 
Two years ago, I came back to the CCSBT world. I was surprised to see the level of 
SBT stock continued to be extremely low. Japan believes that it is greatly important to 
express the public our commitment to ensure rebuilding the SBT stock in the near future 
at the CCSBT 17. Apart from the CITES issues, I consider CCSBT are now facing a 
critical situation whether it can survive or not. I am afraid that this meeting might be the 
last chance to show that the CCSBT functions normally and has a good performance. In 
this context, Japanese delegation makes best effort at this meeting.  
 
Japan has accepted 50% of deduction of its national allocation over last five years. It 
was not easy effort for us. Australian delegation mentioned yesterday that Australian 
SBT fishery is a costal fishery and doesn’t have any alternatives. However, there is also 
no alternative fishing ground for Japanese fishing vessels. In fact, Japanese government 
has conducted reduction of 87 vessels over last several years, which caused significant 
impact on the relevant local communities as well as on fishers. In spite of that, Japan 
strongly recognizes that rebuilding of the stock is the most important. At the last year’s 
meeting in Jeju, we accepted further reduction of our allocation, even though it had been 
already decided. Therefore, once the global TAC increases, Japan should have due right 
to get the benefit on a priority basis, and strongly request such arrangements.      
However, we well recognize that we should not insist each right now. All we have to do 
is to make sure to comply with management measures including TAC for the rebuilding 
of stock. In relation to this, I would like to touch upon two important issues.     
The first is the measures for stock rebuilding. MP is indispensable. However, if the MP 
is not enough to make sure the rebuilding of the stock, we should take same further 
measures. If we detect that the stock is much lower level than we expect, a large amount 
of reduction, even suspension of fishery if necessary, should be considered. On the other 
hand, if the stock shows clearly any sign of rebuilding, deregulation of such measures 
should be taken immediately. For that purpose, we should detect the stock status in a 
timely manner, and should incorporate such data with the management systems.  
The second is the compliance. In this context, I am largely disappointed at the result of 
the Compliance Committee form. In order to achieve the rebuilding of the stock, all 
Members should ensure to comply with same management measures at the same level. 
Unfortunately, at the Compliance Committed meeting, it was recognized that some 
members allowed its fishermen to catch SBT without sufficient compliance. Japan has 
no intention to overlook such a serious situation. In addition, as a market county, we 
will not import SBT caught by such Members. At the Extended Committee, we wish to 
discuss this issue extensively for the best solution.  
I dared to these two issues at my opening statement as they are so important. Let me 
apologize for taking for a long time. Finally, we would like to try our best to get fruitful 
outcomes during this meeting in Taiwan.  
Thank you.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
Tënä koutou, tënä koutou, tënä koutou katoa.  Nga mihi nui ki a koutou 
[Greetings, greetings, many greetings to you all] 
On behalf of the New Zealand delegation I would like to extend our greetings to the Chair, 
members of other delegations and to observers at this meeting. 
Firstly I would like to thank the Chair for his welcome and to thank our hosts for the fine 
venue provided for our discussions this week.  Chair, I will be brief because we have 
important matters to discuss. 
New Zealand has been encouraged by the actions that this Extended Commission has taken in 
the last year to address the poor state of the southern bluefin tuna resource but there remains 
much to do.  At this meeting we will be required to agree a management procedure so that it 
can begin to generate future global catch limits aimed at rebuilding this depleted stock.  
While some basic characteristics of the management procedure have been agreed there are 
choices regarding critical elements that will dictate the way this rebuilding occurs.  New 
Zealand would like to express our thanks in advance to the members of the extended 
scientific committee for the work they have done to provide us information to allow those 
choices to be made. 
At the outset I would like to signal New Zealand expectations for a management procedure.  
Firstly we will be looking for the adoption of a management procedure that rapidly moves the 
stock from its current very low level, and the high risk associated with that, to a more certain 
position in the short term.  The management procedure will also be one that provides 
reasonable certainty that rebuilding will in fact occur and that reaches the interim rebuild 
target that we have agreed in the shortest of the rebuild timeframe options that will be put 
before us.  I would like to emphasise that this is an interim target. Once we reach it further 
rebuilding will be required to reach a target that has international acceptability.  
New Zealand considers that this Extended Commission must adopt a management procedure 
that is precautionary.  While there are some positive indications from the stock we should not 
be fooled into thinking that all is now well.   We must bear in mind that we have not only a 
mutual interest in achieving a successful stock rebuild but also an international obligation to 
do so.  We perceive that the international community is losing patience with regional 
organisations that fail to meet their obligations. 
Chair this is not the only issue of importance for decision at this meeting.  We continue to 
need engagement on compliance issues and other matters relating to the administration of the 
fishery.  I will not elaborate on these at this stage but would note that fisheries management is 
not an exact art and nor is fishing an exact science.  While we must pursue rigorous controls 
to ensure compliance with measures we must also consider the need for some flexibility in 
the way our industries go about their business. 
Chair in closing let me say that the New Zealand delegation is here to work cooperatively 
with other members to achieve positive outcomes for the southern bluefin tuna fishery and we 
look forward to a successful outcome from this meeting.   
Thank you

Opening Statement by Korea 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen, Good morning. 
On behalf of Korean delegation, I would like to thank the Government of Taiwan for  
hosting the 17th annual meeting of the Extended Commission for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna in this traditionally decorated antique beautiful building. And 
also my thanks go to Mr. Kennedy and the staff of secretariat who made every effort to 
prepare this meeting.  
 
As you recall, in the last year’s annual meeting held in Jeju, Korea, we were extremely 
keen of the stock status of the southern bluefin tuna and then spent overnight for taking 
conservation measure. Even though meaningful reduction of its global catch was taken 
as a measure, the situation has not been changed. But fortunately, our efforts have been 
made such as development of stock rebuilding strategy and enhancement of MCS 
measures in early this year. Furthermore, we have checked and found the loopholes and 
gaps from the implementation of these measures, so that we have come to know the way 
on which we are and to go during the meeting last weekend. I thank all the participants 
for these timely and appropriate efforts.  
 
In early this September, the Scientific Committee has come to finalize and brought up 
options of the management procedure (MP) for adoption by this Extended Commission. 
As I know, it is the most up-to-date method for the conservation and management of 
wildlife inclusive of precautionary ecosystem approach. I have been reported that it was 
highly sophisticated and technical such that it took long time since 2000 for scientists to 
struggle with designing the models from the enormous elements and conditions of the 
SBT stock and its fishery and the robustness test of the model performance. For that, I 
would like to congratulate the Chair of the SC, Dr. Annala and all scientists for 
providing the excellent MP options.  
   
Now, in this meeting, we are going to select one MP, the best to suit for addressing the 
situation that the SBT faces and to achieve our management goals mandated in the 
Convention. Once the MP selected, we ought to concentrate our every effort for 
effectively implementing it under the stringent MCS we have adopted and following the 
conservation and management strategy for stock rebuilding we have developed.   
 
I sincerely hope that during this meeting, serious discussions would take place on these 
matters. In this respect, Korea, as a responsible fishing nation with a long long history 
of fisheries, is committed to exert its utmost effort to contribute to implementing all the 
measures for the sake of both the stock rebuilding, and the stable and sustainable 
fishery, while positively participating in finding the right direction of the Commission, 
and thus finally meeting the social and economic needs of the members.  
 
Ending, I hope that the CCSBT can stand as the most successful RFMO and the most 
productive place for discussions regarding fisheries.  
 
I wish we could have fruitful result through constructive discussions here.  
Thank you

Opening Statement by European Union 
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
It is a pleasure for the European Union to take part to the Annual Meeting of the 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, and we would like to 
thank Taiwan for hosting this meeting.  
 
As you are aware, our interest in being here today is not economic: the EU fleet does 
not target Southern Bluefin Tuna and does not plan to do so in the future.  
 
Our presence here is rather justified by our general approach to fisheries, which aims 
at making any effort to ensure coherent policies and management actions of tuna 
fisheries among the different Regional Fisheries Management Organisations. We 
come here to learn from your experience and to bring ours.  
 
The task of this and other RFMOs is not easy. Still, we should acknowledge that we 
receive help by an increased interest and legitimacy for our action. Civil society and 
NGOs are becoming more and more aware of the interests at stake and we, the 
managers, are creating better tools to better reach our target. It is for this reason that 
the EU is a strong supporter of the Kobe process, through which, governance in tuna 
fisheries is progressively improving. 
 
It is through the cooperation with other RFMOs, the exchange of best practices and 
the endorsement and implementation of the recommendations made in that forum, that 
we can give CSSBT and other Tuna RFMOs the tools to achieve their goals. As the 
Kobe meetings keeps showing us, many things have been done, but a lot still remains 
to do. And we are here this week also to progress on this path. 
 
Still, our interest for a global approach does not diminish our commitment in the work 
of CCSBT. As you know, at the beginning of this year we have undertaken the first 
steps for becoming members of this Commission. It is the beginning of a long and 
energy-consuming process which will require the amendment of the existing 
Convention. We are motivated to undergo this path but, of course, we will need your 
help and support for doing so.  
 
We look forward to participating in this meeting and hope it will be a productive and 
successful one. 
 
Thank you

Opening Statement by Philippines  
                                                     
On behalf of the Philippine delegation I would like to express our greetings to the Chairman, 
and also would like to thank Taiwan for hosting this meeting. 
Our presence here is in line with our commitment for the management and conservation of 
tunas in whatever oceans they are found as evidenced by our membership in the International 
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) , Indian Ocean Tuna 
Commission (IOTC), Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission ( WCPFC)   and as 
cooperating non-member of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
(CCSBT). We would like to confirm our continued commitment to CCSBT for the 
sustainable management of the Southern Bluefin Tuna. 
The Philippines does not target Southern Bluefin Tuna it is only a by-catch of our few 
longline vessels fishing in the CCSBT area.  Pursuant to such commitment to comply with 
the CCSBT management measures, it requires all vessels registered under CCSBT to 
subscribe to the Philippines vessel monitoring system (VMS).  
We look forward to participating in the discussion of the different agenda items and hope that 
the outcome of the meeting will be a productive one.  Finally,  it is respectfully   requested to 
this Commission, that the Philippines be granted the cooperating non-member status in the 
year ahead.

Opening Statement by South Africa 
 
South Africa wishes to congratulate Taiwan on its National Day anniversary and 
wishes to express our sincere gratitude to our colleagues from Taiwan for hosting the 
CCSBT meetings in such a prestigious venue as the Grand Hotel and hopes that this 
year’s meeting would also be a landmark meeting in many respects. We also thank the 
secretariat staff for their tireless work in providing the necessary support to Members 
and Co-operating Non-Members of this organisation. South Africa is fully aware of 
the status of the southern bluefin tuna resources and is fully committed to assist 
CCSBT in rebuilding this valuable resource both as a flag state and a port state. 
 
As a flag state, South Africa has implemented all the relevant management and 
conservation measures of CCSBT and exceeds many of the minimum management 
standards. For example South Africa monitors all landings, on board scientific 
observer coverage exceeds 10%, an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF) has been 
implemented, and all trade documents are verified and validated. South Africa has 
also demonstrated responsibility in managing its quota, despite its insufficient size to 
develop a directed southern bluefin fishery within its EEZ. 
 
As a port state, South Africa has made concerted efforts since 2007 in implementing 
port state measures to ensure that its ports are no longer used as “ports of 
convenience” by foreign flag fishing vessels. This is of particular importance to 
CCSBT as South African ports are adjacent to one of the important southern bluefin 
longline fishing grounds, and our ports are frequently utilized by many of the distant 
water fleets of the CCSBT Parties.  
 
In further demonstrating our commitment to CCSBT South Africa has participated in 
the last three meetings of the Compliance Committee and the Extended Commission 
meetings, and is currently in the formal process of ratifying the CCSBT Agreement. It 
is hoped that South Africa’s rights as a developing coastal and range state to develop a 
directed southern bluefin fishery would be recognized, and that considerations of 
future allocations would be considered in an equitable and transparent manner.  
 
In closing we look forward to participating in this year’s Extended Commission and 
we view the adoption of a strategy and management procedure to rebuild the stock, 
the criteria for TAC determination and allocation thereof, as landmarks in the history 
of this organisation.

Opening Statement by Humane Society International 
 
HSI would first like to express its appreciation for being provided with the opportunity to 
participate in the obligatory efforts of the CCSBT to address management issues it faces. 
Although this is a comparatively small TRFMO, these management issues are perhaps more 
serious and challenging than those confronting other TRMO’s, and they require appropriate 
decisions to be made as a matter of urgency. However, irrespective of decisions made within 
this meeting of the Extended Commission, little may actually be achieved unless change can 
be assured at-sea where the problems exist. This is perhaps the greatest management 
challenge of all, yet despite the lack of progress in this area to date, HSI remains optimistic 
that this challenge is not insurmountable. 
HSI does recognise the immediate priority that conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
demands and urges members to reach agreement on ways to achieve this. This task must not 
impede progress to urgently address the serious issue of longline fishing impacts on other 
species. Clear options for such progress, particularly practical mitigation measures, actually 
exist. Surely the 17th Commission Meeting will not also fail to achieve significant progress 
in this area? 
Considering that Southern Bluefin Tuna stocks are currently at the perilously low level of 
around 5% it is difficult for HSI to see an option other than a zero TAC of SBT to ensure that 
all members can benefit from stock recovery within an acceptable timeframe with high 
reliability. The implications of zero TAC do need to be carefully considered because there 
may still be potential for unresolved management issues to persist. HSI does recognise the 
various obstacles that members may face from such a drastic measure and wishes to thank 
them in advance for their efforts. 
Attachment 6-2 
 
Opening Statement by ACAP 
 
On behalf of the Parties to the ACAP Agreement I would like to thank you Mr Chairman for 
the opportunity to address this meeting and to wish you well for the successful conclusion of 
the important items of business included in the agenda.   
I would like to provide you with a brief update on the recent work of the Agreement and to 
outline the major challenges facing us in our work and the ways in which we hope to work 
with this Commission to address them. 
Over the past year there has been a significant advancement in our understanding of the 
issues associated with the incidental mortality of albatrosses and petrels in pelagic longline 
fisheries.  Key research undertaken by United States and Japanese researchers with the 
support of the South African Government has revealed that in some fisheries, albatrosses are 
taking baited hooks brought to the surface by diving petrels, who can access baited hooks 
beyond the area covered by tori lines.  This research has highlighted the importance of 
achieving a fast sink rate of baited hooks, to take them beyond the reach of both albatrosses 
and petrels as quickly as possible.   
Attaching weights to branch-lines is one method used to achieve a fast sink rate, however the 
use of weights can create safety hazards to fishermen, as a result of flybacks when the lines 
are cut suddenly close to the ship.  Progress has been made on methods to address these risks, 
through the use of specially developed leads and through new techniques for attaching 
weights being developed by Japanese researchers and fishing masters. 
However, developing effective mitigation measures is only one of the challenges facing us in 
addressing seabird bycatch.  Knowing where to apply these measures is just as critical.  
Requiring fishers to apply mitigation measures when they are not required isunnecessary and 
inefficient.  The WCPFC has recently completed a seabird ecological risk assessment (ERA) 
for its area of competence, and this exercise has been very useful in identifying areas where 
seabirds are most likely to be at threat from fishing operations.  However, data is required 
from observer programmes to validate these ERA and to refine the area of application for 
mitigation measures.   
There are two issues which this meeting will consider which are of relevance to this issue.  
The first is to decide what data should be collected and how it will be accessed.  The second 
issue of relevance is the proposed memorandum of understanding between the CCSBT and 
ACAP, a primary focus of which is to formalise the process for the exchange of data between 
our two organisations.  
ACAP looks forward to supporting the work of the CCSBT.  We are making significant 
advances in our understanding of the issues associated with seabird bycatch, however it is 
only by working cooperatively with fisheries management organisation and most importantly 
with the fishing industry itself that many of these species will be saved from extinction.  
I look forward to contributing to the work of this meeting in helping to achieve these 
outcomes.   
My thanks to you Mr Chairman, and also to the participants of this meeting, for the 
opportunity to address you on this important issue.  I look forward to working with you over 
the coming days. 
 
Attachment 6-3 
 
Opening Statement by TRAFFIC 
 
Thank you Mr Chairman. 
 
TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, and WWF thank the Commission 
for the opportunity to participate as observers to meetings of the Commission and 
the Extended Commission.  We look forward to contributing to these critical 
deliberations and to helping to implement subsequent decisions.  We earnestly hope 
and expect that Members will make the necessary decisions with the necessary sense 
of urgency to effectively conserve the southern bluefin species of tuna and other 
ecologically related species, especially sharks, seabirds and turtles. 
 
We are pleased with the progress of the most recent CCSBT meetings, particularly the 
reduction in the TAC in 2009 and the commitment by members to agree a 
management procedure at this commission meeting. At the opening of CCSBT 16 we 
called upon the members of CCSBT to implement a temporary TAC of zero based on 
the need to recover the stock. While there have been positive outcomes from the 
recent Commission meetings, we still have significant concerns surrounding the stock 
status which would be best served by a temporary TAC of zero which would afford 
the greatest probability of the stock recovering in the quickest period possible.  
 
We are committed to working with the members of CCSBT through the current 
process of agreeing a Management Procedure at this meeting, but we must make one 
point very clear. Promises by RFMOs need to equate to real action and not simply 
keep us on a holding pattern while stocks further decline. This is how we will be 
judged after this week. 
 
Focusing on the issues at hand for this Extended Commission meeting, the main 
decision will be surrounding the type of Management Procedure adopted and the 
extent to which it is precautionary and represents a speedy recovery to a level 
consistent with a spawning stock of 20% of virgin spawning stock levels. 
 
We would like to see the decisions this week reflect: 
 
• The adoption of the more reactive Management Procedure (MP_1); 
• The adoption of the more precautionary goal of 2035 as a rebuilding target. It 
will be critical to ensure that adequate progress is monitored to ensure the 
rebuilding target is met; 
• The adoption of a probability of 90% for achieving the interim rebuilding 
target. The stock is at a historically low level and has been for a long period in 
the face of inadequate management action by CCSBT and a substantial over 
catch by one of its members; 
• The adoption and implementation of an adequately independent regional 
observer programme that is well supported by the CCSBT catch document 
scheme; 
• The requirement for tagged SBT in trade to extend beyond whole fish to all 
parts and derivatives, that is all products; and 
• The adoption of binding measures requiring the provision of fine scale, shot by 
shot data. 
 
TRAFFIC and WWF remain deeply concerned about the need for conservation of 
ecologically related species as well as SBT. We are particularly concerned at the lack 
of binding measures for shark conservation including shark catch reporting & 
identification and the tagging of product in trade, the retention of all sharks on board, 
and retention of fins naturally attached until landed. 
 
We also feel that the Commission needs to take urgent and particular note of the 
implications for CCSBT of relevant global developments such as the Kobe II 
process and its workshops.  At this time of particular note are the recommendations 
from these workshops: 
 
1. “Develop publicly available authorised and active vessel lists for all gears. 
These lists will include small-scale fishing vessels that are capable of catching 
significant amounts of fish under the competency of tuna RFMOs.”; We 
consider authorised vessels must have and provide an IMO number as their 
unique vessel identifier as an eligibility criterion for being authorised and that 
it is explicit that the member is notifying that the vessel has been authorised to 
fish in that year, not just a standing list of possible vessels. This will assist in 
identifying IUU activity by any particular vessel in a year;  
2. “Develop a consistent enforceable regime for sanctions and penalties, to be 
applied to RFMO members and non-members and their vessels that breach the 
rules and regulations developed and implemented by RFMOs.”; 
3. The working group on bycatch specifically recommended adopting 
“binding” measures; and finally 
4. “As a matter of priority, establish a joint Tuna RFMO bycatch technical 
working group to promote greater cooperation and coordination among 
RFMOs. 
 
Finally, Mr Chairman, TRAFFIC and WWF support the development of the 
management procedure within CCSBT and urge its full implementation as a priority. 
Discussions must focus on promptly returning the SBT population to levels that can 
be considered biologically safe and consistent with the application of the 
precautionary principle.  
 
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
1. 
Ms Trysh Stone (Australia) was agreed by Members to be the Chair of the Finance and 
Administration Committee (FAC).  The Chair proposed a general agenda which was agreed 
by the FAC. 
 
2. 
The FAC discussed the revised budget for 2010, and the proposed budget for 2011, including 
the Australian proposal for shared funding of the scientific aerial survey, the proposal to 
adequately resource compliance activity planned by the Extended Commission, other 
contingency items, an estimate of costs for a 2011 SFMWG meeting, capacity building for 
Indonesia and any ERSWG costs in 2011.

The revised budget for 2010 
 
4. 
The Executive Secretary gave a summary of the 2010 revised budget, highlighting the 10 
percent saving from the approved 2010 budget. The FAC thanked the Executive Secretary for 
the work done on the budget, particularly in terms of the savings. 
 
5. 
The FAC recommends that the revised budget for 2010 (Annex A) be agreed by the 
Commission. 
 
The proposed budget for 2011 
 
6. 
The FAC considered the proposed budget for 2011.   
 
7. 
The Executive Secretary explained the significance of exchange rates in the budget, and stated 
that a modified exchange rate was applied to ensure that budget figures were not understated 
by the prevailing strong Australian dollar. 
 
8. 
The FAC noted that the cost of the ESC and EC in 2011 will increase by AU$82,500 because 
of the extended time for the Compliance Committee, the inclusion of a rest day and increased 
hire of equipment costs which are a result of local hiring rates for those meetings. 
 
9. 
The Chair of the ESC advised the FAC that one of the current Advisory Panel members has 
signaled an intention to retire.  That Panel member has been asked by the SC/ESC to return 
for 2011 in light of the current workload and projected tasking.  The Chair of the SC advised 
that it was desirable to have no less than three Panel members at this time. 
 
10. 
The FAC recommends that the SC/ESC Advisory Panel is reviewed and requests the Chair of 
the ESC to prepare a paper that outlines the required roles for independent Panel members and 
consider moving to a three-person Panel that covers all required roles for consideration by the 
FAC in 2011. 
 
11. 
The FAC agreed that funding for the ESC Chair participation at the Kobe 3 meeting is 
removed from the 2011 proposed budget.  CCSBT will be represented by the Executive 
Secretary at Kobe 3. 
 
12. 
The FAC agreed that the allocation for the operating model/management strategy 
development item is increased to AU$20,000 in light of further work that may be required on 
the management procedure.  This is offset by the removal of funding of the ESC Chair 
participation at Kobe 3. 
 
13. 
The FAC agreed that AU$6,000 funding be provided to support and training programs to 
enhance Indonesia’s participation in the stock assessment/management procedure work. 
 
Shared funding of aerial survey 
   
14. 
The FAC discussed Australia’s funding of the aerial survey. Members thanked Australia for 
its undertaking of the aerial survey of juvenile SBT, but were unable to support either partial 
or full shared funding of aerial survey at this time. 
 
Employment of a compliance officer 
 
15. 
The FAC noted that the Secretariat staff are fully utilised and have little capacity to take on 
extra functions.  The FAC supported the provision of adequate compliance resources to the 
Commission.  Some Members noted that their domestic regulations prevented them from 
being able to increase the Commission staff at this meeting.  On that basis, the FAC agreed to 
include an amount of AU$30,000 funding for consultants to assist in the development of the 
compliance plan and policies. 
 
16. 
The FAC agreed that this matter should be further considered for 2012 and requested the 
Secretariat to include adequate compliance resources in the draft 2012 budget.  The Chair 
urged all members to ensure that they were in a position that would allow them to consider the 
appointment of a compliance officer if that was the will of the Extended Commission. 
 
Other contingency items 
 
17. 
The Chair of the ESC advised that more time may need to be scheduled for those meetings in 
2011, but this will depend on the work program issued by the Extended Commission.  
However, the FAC has not made allowance for this in the budget at this time. 
 
2011 SFMWG meeting 
 
18. 
The FAC agreed to include AU$84,612, based on a three-day SFMWG meeting, in the budget 
which includes approximately AU$10,000 to fund attendance of the Chair of the Compliance 
Committee. 
 
ERSWG meeting costs in 2011 
 
19. 
The FAC noted that there is no necessity to provide extra funding for this item in 2011. 
 
20. 
The FAC recommends that the proposed budget for 2011 (Annex B) of AU$1,775,312 be 
agreed by the Commission.  The required financial contribution of each Member is shown in 
the income statement of the budget. 
 
Administrative matters 
Redevelopment of the CCSBT website 
 
21. 
The Executive Secretary updated the FAC on the progress and plans for the CCSBT website 
in 2011.  The FAC was pleased with plans to improve the website including providing 
additional security to the data sharing section of the website. 
 
Other matters 
 
22. 
The FAC discussed the funding of SBT tags and Members shared their respective 
experiences.  The FAC noted that the costs of tags are in some cases met by government and 
in some cases recovered from industry, depending on the situation in each country.

that do not have long-term observer status in accordance with Rule 3.3 which have 
expressed an interest in sending observers to attend the next meeting of the

Attachment 14 
 
 
Statement by Australia in Regards to Fishing in the CCAMLR Area of Waters 
 
 
Australia requests that members should refrain from allowing their vessels to fish in 
the CAMLR Convention Area until such time as a co-operation agreement between 
CCAMLR and CCSBT can be agreed.   
 
Australia notes that under the CCAMLR rules, vessels are not able to fish in the 
CCAMLR Area unless they are licensed to fish by the CCAMLR Commission.  
Additionally Conservation and Management Measures applicable to the CCAMLR 
Area place restrictions on gear types; species taken; detailed catch reporting; 100% 
observer coverage under an international scheme of observation; and a CCAMLR 
authorised VMS system. 
 
Australia considers that fishing within the CAMLR Convention Area without being 
licensed under the CCAMLR system would be considered to be IUU fishing by 
CCAMLR.  Australia requests that in order to support the cooperation between 
CCSBT and CCAMLR in establishing an MoU, that Members and CNMs refrain 
from fishing for SBT in the CCAMLR convention area until such time as the MoU is 
finalised.

shall have access to the data necessary to perform their CCSBT duties.  
 
4. Officers of the Commission2 and its subsidiary bodies, who have read and signed the 
Commission’s confidentiality protocol, shall have access to the data necessary to perform 
their CCSBT duties.  
 
5. Members and Cooperating Non-Members (CNM) of the Extended Commission shall have 
access to data to serve the purposes of the Convention, including data:

14. All access to and dissemination of Non-Public Domain data shall only be authorised in 
accordance with these Rules and Procedures and shall be protected in accordance with the 
CCSBT Data Security Standards specified in Attachment 1.  
 
15. The CCSBT Secretariat shall log and report to the Extended Commission all access and 
release of Non-Public Domain data with a “Medium” or High” risk classification 
including where applicable, the name and affiliation of the person, the type of data

Domain data to serve the purposes of the Convention, including data:  
(a) Covering vessels flying their flag that were authorised or engaged in fishing for, 
retaining on board, transhipping or landing southern bluefin tuna.  
(b) Covering any vessels fishing in waters under their jurisdiction for the time period 
during which such fishing occurred.  
 (c) For the purpose of scientific and other research, if the Member or CNM of the 
Extended Commission that originally provided that data authorises the Extended 
Commission to release them or if the data have a “Low” confidentiality risk 
classification according to Table 13.  In cases where a Member or CNM of the 
Extended Commission elects to provide an ongoing authorisation for the release of 
such data, the Member or CNM may at any time cancel this authorisation by notifying 
the Secretariat that it has revised its earlier decision. 
 
18. Members and CNMs of the Extended Commission shall notify the Secretariat of a small 
number of representatives (preferably only 2) authorised to submit requests4 for access to 
Non-Public Domain data. Such notification will include name, affiliation, and contact 
information (e.g. telephone, facsimile, email address). The CCSBT Secretariat will 
maintain a list of such authorised representatives. Members and CNMs of the Extended

procedures referred to in paragraph 21 above.] 
 
23. Access to Non-Public Domain data by Members and CNMs of the Extended Commission 
shall be administered and authorised by the Executive Secretary on the basis of these 
Rules and Procedures in conjunction with the Procedures for Requesting the Release of 
Non-Public Domain data at Attachment 2. 
 
25. A Member or CNM that has not fulfilled its obligations to provide data to the Extended 
Commission for two consecutive years shall not be granted access to Non-Public Domain 
data until all such obligations are met. A Member or CNM whose representative, 
authorised in accordance with paragraphs 18 and 19 above, failed to observe the rules 
stipulated in these Rules and Procedures shall not be granted access to Non-Public 
Domain data until appropriate actions have been taken.  
 
 
4.5 Exchange of data with other regional fisheries management organisations  
 
27. If the Commission enters into agreements for the exchange of data with other regional 
fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) or other organisations, such agreements 
must include requirements that the other RFMO provides equivalent data on a reciprocal 
basis and maintains the data provided to them in a manner consistent with the CCSBT 
Data Security Standards. The data that may be exchanged are data with a risk 
classification of “no risk” or “low risk”.  Data with higher risk classifications may only be 
considered for sharing after specific approval from the Extended Commission. At each 
annual session the Executive Secretary will provide copies of data exchange agreements 
that exist with other RFMOs and a summary of the data exchanges that occurred during 
the previous 12 months under such agreements. 
 
 
4.5 Disseminations of Non-Public Domain data in other circumstances  
 
26. Non-Public Domain data will be made available by the Secretariat to any persons5 if the 
Member or CNM of the Extended Commission that originally provided that data 
authorises the Extended Commission to release them. In cases where a Member or CNM 
of the Extended Commission elects to provide an ongoing authorisation for the release of 
such data, the Member or CNM may at any time cancel this authorisation by notifying the 
Secretariat that it has revised its earlier decision. 
 
27. Conditions for access to Non-Public Domain data by each non-Member shall be 
determined on a case by case basis by the Member or CNM of the Extended Commission 
that originally provided the data.  At the discretion of that Member or CNM, these 
conditions may or may not involve procedures similar to those specified at Attachment 2. 
                                                 
5 Including universities, researchers, NGOs, media, consultants, industry, federations, etc. 
  
 
4.6 Force majeure  
 
28. The Executive Secretary may authorise the release of Non-Public Domain data to rescue 
agencies in cases of force majeure in which the safety of life at sea is at risk. 
 
 
5. Periodic Review  
 
29. The Extended Commission or its subsidiary bodies will periodically review these Rules 
and Procedures, and subsidiary documents, and the rules and procedures referred to in 
paragraphs 21 and 22 above, and amend these if necessary.  
 
30. When considering the provision of data not specified in Table 1, the Extended 
Commission or its subsidiary bodies should consider an appropriate risk classification for 
that data for inclusion in Table 1. 
 
 
6. Final Clause  
31. These Rules and Procedures do not prevent a Member or CNM from authorising the 
release of any data it has provided to the CCSBT. 
Table 1: Types of information and confidentiality risk classification.   
Information types that have not received a risk classification within this table will not be managed 
within these confidentiality rules.  However, this table may be updated by the Extended Commission 
from time to time, including through intercessional agreement between Members of the Extended 
Commission, as required. 
 
With the exception of approved summaries of certain information types below, the following broad 
dissemination principles apply to the four confidentiality risk classifications6: 
• 
“No risk”:  Publicly available and may be place on the public area of the CCSBT web site. 
• 
“Low Risk”:  Not publicly available.  However, it is available to all Members and CNMs 
without specific approval and may be placed on the private area of the CCSBT web site and 
on the CCSBT Data CD. 
• 
“Medium Risk”:  Not publicly available.  Requires specific authorisation to be released.  May 
not be placed on the CCSBT Data CD or on the private area of the CCSBT web site (unless in 
a special part of the private area that is further restricted to specifically authorised people). 
• 
“High Risk”:  Not publicly available.  Requires specific authorisation to be released.  May not 
be placed on the CCSBT Data CD or on the private area of the CCSBT web site.

specified in the CCSBT Data Confidentiality Security Policy. 
7 This information does not currently exist, but will become available once the CDS has been in operation for 12 months. 
8 Catch at size and age data are considered to public after the annual Commission meeting each year.  Other biological data 
are only considered public if adequate time has passed to allow the scientists that organised the collection of such data to 
publish a paper analysing it. 
9 Only data from the CCSBT operated tagging program are considered to be “No risk”. 
10 Also available to non-Members that are cooperating with the CCSBT CDS.

Attachment 1 
 
CCSBT Data Confidentiality Security Policy (DCSP) 
 
The purpose of this policy is to help ensure that non-public data (within this attachment only, 
non-public data is referred to as “Data”) is provided to and managed by Data receivers in a 
manner that maintains confidentiality.  This policy is not intended to cover aspects of data 
security that are not related to protection of confidentiality, such as loss or damage to data 
(e.g. through fire, flood, accident, systems malfunction etc.). 
 
Data receivers (including the CCSBT Secretariat) are required to manage the security of Data 
to at least the standards specified below.  The standards below are intentionally brief in order 
to provide a clear overview of the scope of the requirements.  Further information can be 
obtained on most items from ISO/IEC 27002:2005(e)14. 
 
The Executive Secretary may impose additional security requirements before releasing 
specific Data.  The receiver of the Data will be required to observe any such additional 
security requirements.  The Executive Secretary may also waive specific security 
requirements if requested to do so by the provider of the Data. 
 
1) Human Resources Security 
• For data with a risk classification of “medium” or “high”, only people approved by the 
Executive Secretary (herein referred to as “Approved People”) shall be allowed access 
to the Data by the receiving organisation (herein referred to as “The Organisation”).  
For data with a “low” risk classification, people approved by the receiving Member or 
CNM shall be allowed to access the data (also referred to herein as “Approved 
People”).; 
• The Organisation shall have appropriate terms and conditions in its 
contract/arrangement with Approved People to state their responsibilities for 
information security and to enable disciplinary action for Approved People who 
commit a security breach. 
• Approved People shall be provided, as appropriate, with information security 
awareness education and training by The Organisation. 
• The Organisation shall have termination procedures in place for maintaining 
confidentiality from Approved People whose role or employment changes.  This will 
include as a minimum, the return or secure disposal15 of the Data, cancellation of 
access to the Data by such approved people, and for Approved People with approval 
for  access to “medium” and High” risk  data, notification to the Executive Secretary 
of the person’s changed status together with the action taken. 
 
                                                 
14 International Standard on “Information technology – Security techniques – Code of practise for information security 
management”. 
15 For data with a “medium” or “high” risk classification, “Secure Disposal” means that media containing the data should be 
disposed of through incineration or shredding of paper records and by physically destroying electronic media or deleting the 
information by overwriting the Data using techniques that make the original information non-retrievable rather than using 
standard delete or format functions.  Secure Disposal of “medium” and “high” risk data requires all copies of the Data, 
including any backups, to be destroyed.  For Data with a “low” risk classification, the disposal procedures required for higher 
risk Data can be adjusted to a more practical process providing that such processes maintain confidentiality.  For example, 
instead of destroying backups containing low risk Data, it would be sufficient to keep those backups in a secure environment 
with procedures in place that prevented unauthorised access to the Data on those backups. 
2) Physical and Environmental Security 
• Any unencrypted Data and products of that Data shall be stored in a physically secure 
area which will at minimum consist of: 
o  a robust security perimeter16 and properly functioning entry controls (such as 
automatic locks with card controlled entry or manned reception desk) that prevent 
entry of unaccompanied non-approved people into the secure area; and 
o A properly functioning and monitored electronic intruder detection system that 
will detect an intrusion into the secure area. 
• Data with a low to medium confidentiality classification and products of that Data that 
are encrypted as described in paragraph “5”, may be used in a non-public area outside 
the secure area described above.  When not in use, the media containing these 
encrypted Data shall be carried in person, or stored in a locked private facility and 
secured or hidden out of sight. 
• Equipment used for displaying the Data (such as monitors and printers) shall be 
located and positioned in such a manner as to prevent unauthorised viewing, recording 
or copying of the displayed information.  Printouts of the Data or products of the Data 
shall be removed from printers immediately. 
• The Data shall be Securely Disposed15 of: 
o 
for “medium” and “high” risk data, when the purpose for which the data were 
requested has been completed; 
o 
for all data, when the data are no longer required by the Organisation to serve the 
purposes of the Convention; 
o 
from any media that are scheduled for maintenance by non-Approved People and 
from any media prior to its disposal. 
 
3) Communication and Operations Management 
• Precautions shall be in place to detect and prevent the introduction of malicious code 
(such as computer viruses, Trojan horses and logic bombs) and unauthorised mobile 
code.  These precautions will at least include: 
o Installation and regular (daily or less) update of malicious code detection and 
repair software to scan computers, media and e-mails for malicious code; and 
o The Organisation shall conduct education awareness campaigns, as appropriate, on 
the dangers of malicious code and how to reduce the risk of infection by malicious 
code. 
• Appropriate network controls shall be implemented to maintain security for any Data 
that is accessible through the network. 
• Cabling carrying the Data shall be protected from interception. 
• The Data shall not be transmitted on public networks (such as the internet) unless the 
Data has been appropriately encrypted. 
• Unencrypted Data shall not be transmitted on wireless networks unless the network is 
a private encrypted network and the Data has a low confidentiality classification.  A 
computer that is connected to a wireless network may not contain Data with a medium 
or high confidentiality classification unless the Data are encrypted and the encrypted 
volume is not mounted (not active) while the computer is connected to the wireless 
network. 
• Any actual or suspected security incidents shall be investigated and reported to the 
Executive Secretary. 
                                                 
16 A ground floor office with windows would require additional protection for the windows, or physically secure internal 
enclosures for the security perimeter to be acceptable. 
 
4) Access Control 
• Access to the Data shall require successful logon by an Approved Person, involving a 
User ID and Password17.   
• The User ID shall be unique to the specific Approved Person. 
• The Password must be kept confidential to the Approved Person only and should be 
subject to a suitable password management policy, including: 
o Provision of any temporary passwords in a secure manner and forcing passwords 
to be changed on first log on; 
o Forcing use of minimal length and complexity of passwords; 
o Prevent re-use of passwords;  
o Advising users to use quality passwords (easy to remember without writing down, 
not based on information that is easy to guess, not vulnerable to dictionary 
attacks, free of consecutive identical or sequential characters, contain both letters 
and numbers and have an acceptable minimum length) and changing passwords 
whenever there is an indication of possible password or system compromise, and 
at regular intervals; 
o Storing, transmitting and displaying passwords in protected (e.g. encrypted) form; 
and 
o Limiting the number of unsuccessful log-on attempts to only 3 and rejecting 
further attempts without specific authorisation. 
• Accounts of Approved People shall be protected when unattended by use of a 
password protected screen saver18 that activates after less than 10 minutes of 
inactivity. 
 
5) Cryptographic Control 
• The Data shall be encrypted using robust encryption techniques whenever it is not in a 
physically secure area as described in paragraph “2” above. 
• Provision or transmission of Data by the Secretariat to data receivers or to the private 
area of the CCSBT web site19 shall use encryption techniques (encrypted files or 
encrypted transmission protocols). 
• Encryption may use either secret key techniques or public key techniques where each 
user has a public and a private key.  For both types of techniques, a wide variety of 
suitable file encryption software is available for purchase (such as PGP) or for free 
(such as TrueCrypt). 
• Encrypted volumes shall be automatically dismounted when there has been no activity 
(reading/writing to the encrypted volume) for 60 minutes, after entering a power 
saving mode, and when the user logs off. 
• Secret and private keys shall be protected from unauthorised disclosure and shall be 
distributed to intended users in a secure manner. 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
17 Other technologies for identification and authentication such as biometrics (e.g. finger-print verification) may be used. 
18 Or equivalent measure. 
19 Unless otherwise agreed by the provider of the Data, only Data with a medium confidentiality classification or less may be 
placed on the private area of the CCSBT web site.  However, Data with a medium confidentiality classification must be 
placed in a further restricted part of the private area that can only be accessed by people specifically authorised to access that 
Data. 
Attachment 2 
 
Procedures for Requesting the Release of Non-Public Domain Data 
1. Member’s and CNM’s of the Extended Commission that have provided Non-Public 
Domain data to the CCSBT shall notify the Secretariat regarding their representatives with 
the authority to authorise the release of Non-Public Domain data by the CCSBT.  
Decisions whether to authorise the release of such data shall be made in a timely manner.

Attachment 16 
 
Australia’s Proposed Draft Resolution on the Provision of Fisheries-Dependent 
Data to Support the Scientific Assessment of Southern Bluefin Tuna and 
Ecologically Related Species 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), 
 
Recalling that, at its sixteenth annual meeting, the Extended Commission Members 
and Cooperating Non-Members agreed to measures to systematically verify catch data 
of southern bluefin tuna and ecologically related species by fishers (the Resolution on 
action plans to ensure compliance with Conservation and Management Measures); 
 
Mindful of the risk that incomplete submission of fisheries-dependent scientific data 
poses to the scientific assessment of the southern bluefin tuna stock; 
 
Recognising the recommendations of the 2010 Joint Tuna RFMO Workshop on the 
Provision of Scientific Advice on catch, effort and size data; 
 
Recognising that the ability of the Extended Scientific Committee to provide good 
quality advice depends on its access to the most recent fine-scale fisheries-dependent 
data; 
 
 
Agrees, in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 5 and paragraph 1(a) of Article 8 of 
the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, that: 
 
1. The flag Members and Cooperating Non-Members of pelagic longline vessels 
shall annually provide shot-by-shot catch and effort data for the most recently 
completed fishing season to the Secretariat on the following basis: 
a. The Secretariat shall maintain the data and make the data available to 
the Extended Scientific Committee for inclusion in stock assessments, 
the management procedure and other necessary scientific processes; 
b. The data made available by the Secretariat to the Extended Scientific 
Committee shall not be aggregated by vessel, gear, fleet, month, year, 
latitude or longitude; 
c. The shot-by-shot catch and effort data should include target species per 
shot, number of hooks, number of baskets, gear, fleet, day, month, year, 
latitude and longitude to two decimel places, weight and number of 
retained and discarded southern bluefin tuna, and number of 
ecologically related species including key species used in the 
standardisation of catch and effort series; 
d. The Secretariat may obscure the distinguishing symbol of individual 
vessels with a unique identifier at the request of a Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member. 
2. The Members and Cooperating Non-Members farming southern bluefin tuna 
shall annually provide shot-by-shot operational data for the most recently 
completed fishing season to the Secretariat on the following basis; 
a. The Secretariat shall maintain the data and make the data available to 
the Extended Scientific Committee for inclusion in stock assessments, 
the management procedure and other necessary scientific processes; 
b. The data made available by the Secretariat to the Extended Scientific 
Committee shall not be aggregated by vessel, gear, fleet, month, year, 
latitude or longitude; 
c. The shot-by-shot operational data should include target species per 
shot, gear, fleet, day, month, year, latitude and longitude to two 
decimel places, number of hours searched including with spotter 
aircraft, weight and number of retained and released southern bluefin 
tuna, and number of ecologically related species;  
d. Report, in a timely manner, on methods to improve the quality of 
methods to estimate the total weight and size composition of southern 
bluefin tuna caught by purse seiners; 
e. The Secretariat may obscure the distinguishing symbol of individual 
vessels with a unique identifier at the request of a Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member. 
3. The Members and Cooperating Non-Members may directly exchange 
fisheries-dependent data and other information relevant to scientific 
assessment of southern bluefin tuna and ecologically related species when 
appropriate. 
4. The provision of fisheries-dependent data by Members and Cooperating Non-
Members to the Secretariat shall be in accordance with the ‘Rules and 
Procedures for the Protection, Access to, and dissemination of Data Compiled 
by the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna’.
