remind the meeting of the main mandate of the Commission, the Chair recited the 
poem "The Way of Bluefin Tuna-2" (Attachment 7). 
2 
 
Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
11. Members noted the report from the Secretariat (CCSBT-EC/1110/04) and agreed 
to the following recommendations: 
a) that the terms for the Chair of the Extended Scientific Committee and Chair of 
the Compliance Committee be extended for a further two year period; 
b) that the CCSBT Rules of Procedure be amended as shown in Attachment 8 to 
allow the Provisional Agenda for all meetings of the CCSBT to be made 
publicly available prior to the meeting.  It was further agreed that any sensitive 
material could be excluded from the annotations in the Provisional Agenda 
before it is made public at the request of Member(s); and 
c) that the Finance and Administration Committee would discuss and make 
recommendations on the appointment of a Compliance Manager position to 
the Secretariat. 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
12. The Executive Secretary provided an outline of the financial matters that the 
meeting would need to consider, including the revised budget for 2011 (CCSBT-
EC/1110/05), and the proposed budget for 2012 (CCSBT-EC/1011/06).  Detailed 
consideration of these papers was referred to the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC). 
13. The FAC was convened to consider: 
• the revised budget for 2011; 
• the proposed budget for 2012; and 
• other finance and administration issues. 
14. Mr Gordon Neil (Australia) was nominated to Chair the FAC. 
 
3.1.  
Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
15. The Chair of the FAC reported on the outcome of the FAC deliberations. This 
included recommending a revised budget for 2011 and a proposed budget for 
2012. 
16. The Executive Secretariat was requested to prepare a more detailed proposal on 
the trial audit of Members to be considered by the 2012 Compliance Committee 
and Extended Commission meetings. 
 
3.2.  
Discussion on Finance Issues and adoption of budget 
17. Members were unable to agree upon sharing the costs of the Aerial Survey among 
Members, but thanked Australia for its continuing work, noting that the survey 
was very important for SBT stock assessment. 
18. Australia noted that continuing the Aerial Survey was a high priority, but that no 
funds had yet been identified to secure the future of the Aerial Survey in 2012. 
3 
 
Australia further noted that it would make best efforts to find the necessary 
funding and continue the ongoing monitoring of the stock, but may need to 
advise Members in writing later in the year if funding could not be secured and 
that voluntary contributions from Members would be sought if other Members 
were of a similar view that the Aerial Survey should continue in 2012. 
19. The Extended Commission adopted the report of the FAC and all of its 
recommendations, including the revised budget for 2011 and the proposed budget 
for 2012. The report of the FAC is at Attachment 9. 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries and ERS Interactions 
20. Taiwan advised that Korea’s National Report mentioned that Korea imported 
SBT from Taiwan in 2010 and 2011. After checking the Catch Monitoring Forms 
and Re-Export/Export After Landing of Domestic Product Forms provided by 
Korea, it was determined that Taiwanese catch was exported to Japan and then 
re-exported from Japan to Korea, so that they were not imports directly from 
Taiwan. Korea confirmed this. 
 
4.1. 
 Reports on Members’ projects 
21. The meeting agreed that due to extensive discussion of this agenda item at the 6th 
meeting of the Compliance Committee, no further discussion at CCSBT18 was 
necessary. 
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
22. The Chair of the Compliance Committee presented the report of the Compliance 
Committee meeting, thanking the participants for a productive and cooperative 
meeting. The Chair drew attention to the recommendations made by the 
Compliance Committee to the Extended Commission.  
23. The report of the Compliance Committee meeting, including its recommendations, 
was adopted and is at Attachment 10.  
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Special Meeting of the Extended 
Commission 
24. The Chair provided a report on the outcomes of the Special Meeting and noted 
that progress had been made towards agreeing elements of the CCSBT 
Management Procedure and that it was pleasing that the CCSBT Strategic Plan 
was adopted at the Special Meeting of the Extended Commission. 
25. The report of the Special Meeting of the Extended Commission was noted and is 
at Attachment 11. 
 
4 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
26. The Report of the Extended Scientific Committee meeting was adopted at the 
Special Meeting and was not discussed further. 
27. The Chair of the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) presented the results of 
the intersessional work on the Management Procedure that was requested at the 
Special Meeting.  Results were provided for 12 different variations of the Bali 
Procedure based on whether the Management Procedure should have a tuning 
year of 2030 or 2035, a maximum TAC change of 3000 or 5000 tonnes and 
whether there is no increase, a 1000 tonne increase or the full increase in the 
2012-14 TAC period. 
28. As also requested by the Special Meeting of the Extended Commission, the ESC 
Chair reported the possible range of TACs for 2012-2014 depending on the 
above scenarios.  
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Adoption of a Management Procedure 
29. The Extended Commission agreed to adopt a Management Procedure (MP) upon 
which its decisions on the global total allowable catch (TAC) from 2012 and 
beyond will be based. In adopting the MP, the Extended Commission emphasised 
the need to take a precautionary approach to increase the likelihood of the 
spawning stock rebuilding in the short term and to provide industry with more 
stability in the TAC.  
30. The Extended Commission agreed to adopt the Resolution on the Adoption of a 
Management Procedure at Attachment 12.  
31. The meeting also agreed to adopt a Resolution on limited carry-forward of 
uncaught quota which is at Attachment 13. 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
9.1. TAC determination 
32. Taking account of the advice from the Extended Scientific Committee, the 
Extended Commission agreed to adopt a precautionary approach during the early 
stages of the spawning stock rebuilding.   
33. Accordingly, the Extended Commission agreed: 
• To set the TAC for 2012 at 10,449 tonnes 
• To set the TAC for 2013 at 10,949 tonnes, and 
• To set the TAC for 2014 at 12,449 tonnes or at the level based on the MP 
outcomes for 2015 – 2017 (whichever is the less), unless the Extended 
Commission decides otherwise based on the assessment of the Compliance 
Committee.  
 
5 
 
9.2. Research Mortality Allowance 
34. The Extended Commission considered paper CCSBT-EC/1110/12 and approved 
1.0 tonne for a trolling survey in the 2011/2012 season and 5.0 tonnes for 
continued deployment of archival and pop-up satellite tags.  
 
9.3. Allocation of TAC 
35. South Africa made a presentation to Members on reasons it should receive an 
increased allocation of SBT. The presentation is found at Attachment 14. 
36. The Extended Commission reaffirmed the principles for allocation agreed at its 
Special Meeting in August 2011 and agreed to adopt the Resolution on the 
Allocation of the Global Total Allowable Catch at Attachment 15. 
37. The Extended Commission took note of South Africa’s request for an increased 
allocation and agreed to South Africa receiving additional tonnage in 2013 and 
2014, subject to South Africa acceding to the Convention.  The Extended 
Commission noted South Africa’s request to receive a 300t allocation in the 
future and agreed to keep South Africa’s allocation under active review. 
38. South Africa expressed its disappointment that its increase in allocation did not 
reach the level it required to accede to the Convention and also because the 
Extended Commission could not guarantee its increased quota in the future. 
South Africa also noted that it was disappointed that it was not able to fully 
participate in the discussions that ultimately affected South Africa. Furthermore, 
South Africa advised that it was in no position to accept its agreed allocation and 
that it would continue discussions intersessionally. 
39. Japan advised Members that due to its allocation being less than it requires, it is 
undergoing bilateral negotiations with Taiwan for a transfer from Taiwan. Japan 
further advised that it would notify the Secretariat of the details of any such 
transfer and that the Secretariat would advise all Members. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Adoption and implementation of the CCSBT Strategic Plan 
40. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/1110/13 for discussion on 
the implementation of the CCSBT Strategic Plan. This paper related to issues that 
were not being discussed already at the meetings of the Compliance Committee 
or Extended Scientific Committee. 
41. The meeting made the following decisions on these implementation issues:  
• A high-level code of practice shall be developed to provide guidelines for 
scientific data verification. It should be simple and succinct and an 
intersessional working group should be established to provide a draft for 
consideration by the 2012 Extended Scientific Committee meeting.  
• The Extended Commission agreed to provide data on SBT mortalities, or best 
estimates where data are not available, and that the ESC would be asked to 
consider this information in future stock assessments and the MP.  In order to 
make these requirements clearer to new and existing Members, the EC also 
agreed to consider a resolution on this.  However, the EC did not have 
6 
 
sufficient time to review New Zealand’s draft resolution. The draft resolution 
is at Attachment 16, for further consideration in 2012. 
• The Extended Commission should give direction to the ERSWG in relation to 
data provision requirements, and this direction should be considered at agenda 
item 15. 
• The CCSBT’s 2008 ERS Recommendation to Mitigate the Impact on 
Ecological Related Species of Fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna was revised 
as shown in Attachment 17 to include the requirement to comply with 
ICCAT’s measures when fishing in ICCAT’s Convention Area. 
• As part of its work, the ERSWG should evaluate the effectiveness of the ERS 
measures of other tuna RFMOs and the risk to ERS of fishing for SBT.  
CCSBT should also remain active in the Joint Tuna RFMO Bycatch Technical 
Working Group. 
• The Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group (SFMWG) has been 
a very useful forum but due to the functions outlined in its existing Terms of 
Reference having been largely completed, it should be convened on an ad hoc 
basis where a specific issue needs to be addressed. At that time, its Terms of 
Reference could be reviewed. The SFMWG will not be convened in 2012. 
• It is not considered necessary at this stage to adopt rules in relation to the 
confidentiality of compliance data, noting that a policy on MCS information 
collection and sharing has recently been adopted. 
• Developing country Members and CNMs were again encouraged to submit to 
the Extended Commission a table outlining areas where assistance would be 
beneficial. 
o Indonesia noted that fisheries legislation is an area in which future capacity 
building in Indonesia would be useful.  
• The Extended Commission considered it necessary to have the EU present at 
the Extended Commission meeting before discussing possible approaches to 
admitting Regional Economic Integration Organisations into the CCSBT. 
Therefore, no decisions were made on the approach. 
• The Extended Commission should identify and remain informed of new 
market States for SBT and therefore the Secretariat’s recommended process 
should be followed. 
42. Korea was commended on its MCS workshop held in April 2011 with developing 
States, which focused on capacity development. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Cooperating Non-Members 
43. The Executive Secretary presented CCSBT-EC/1110/14, noting that the paper did 
not include analysis of Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) performance since the 
Compliance Committee had been tasked with this analysis and the meeting 
should refer to the report of the 6th Compliance Committee meeting for further 
information. 
44. Members confirmed the CNM status of the European Union, the Philippines and 
South Africa for 2012.  
7 
 
45. However, while acknowledging the extenuating circumstances involved, 
Members expressed their disappointment at the absence of the EU from the 
meeting and its low level of performance particularly relating to compliance with 
catch reporting obligations and implementation of the CDS. Members requested 
that the Executive Secretary write to the EU strongly recommending that it take 
steps to implement the CDS, improve compliance with CCSBT reporting 
obligations. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
46. The meeting noted paper CCSBT-EC/1110/15, which outlined the Secretariat’s 
correspondence with five Non-Members in relation to cooperation with the 
CCSBT CDS. 
47. The Secretariat was asked to maintain its contact with Singapore over the next 
few months and to write to China in relation to its fishing activities and possible 
catch of SBT within the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission’s 
(WCPFC) Convention Area. 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
48. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/1110/16 on interactions 
with other organisations during 2011 and proposals for 2012. 
49. The following reports were delivered by Members as part of their observer duties 
for the CCSBT and are provided at Attachment 18: 
a) New Zealand’s report on the 7th annual meeting of the WCPFC, 7th 
Scientific Committee meeting and 7th Technical and Compliance 
Committee meeting; 
b) Australia’s report on the 2010 annual meeting of the Commission for the 
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources; 
c) Japan’s report on the 17th annual meeting of the International 
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the 15th session 
of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission; and  
d) Taiwan’s report on the 82nd annual meeting of the Inter-American 
Tropical Tuna Commission. 
50. It was agreed that Members to act as Observers on behalf of CCSBT for 2012 
will remain the same as for 2011. 
51. Members agreed to all recommendations made by the Secretariat relating to the 
Kobe Process with the minor amendment that the Secretariat will advise 
Members of any individuals nominated to represent the CCSBT Chair and Vice-
Chair at the Kobe Steering Committee meetings and allow Members the 
opportunity to comment if necessary. 
52. The meeting agreed that the agenda for future annual meetings of the Extended 
Commission include a standing agenda item titled ‘Evaluation of Kobe Process 
Recommendations’. 
8 
 
53. Members were requested to note the Executive Secretary’s request that they 
review and revise the draft list of research priorities of the Joint Bycatch 
Technical Working Group and provide this to the Secretariat by 30 November 
2011. Members were also requested to provide a list of current and upcoming 
CCSBT-related bycatch research to be used in the Bycatch Information 
Mitigation System which would be made publicly available.  
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Confidentiality of Data and Documents 
14.1.   Pending issues on CCSBT Confidentiality arrangements 
54. The Meeting agreed to remove paragraphs 5(c), 21 and 22 of the Rules and 
Procedures for the Protection, Access to, and Dissemination of Data Compiled by 
the CCSBT. 
55. It was further agreed that the heading of Section 1 of this document would be 
changed to read: 
‘Basic principles relating to the dissemination of the data by the CCSBT under 
these rules’ 
56. The agreed Rules and Procedures are at Attachment 19. 
 
14.2.   Confidentiality of reports and documents from 2011 
57. The Extended Commission noted that with exception of Attachment A of 
CCSBT-ESC/1107/04, CCSBT-ESC/1107/27, CCSBT-CC/1110/10 and CCSBT-
CC/1110/BGD03 the reports of meetings and documents submitted to the 
meetings under the jurisdiction of CCSBT18 would be made publicly available. 
 
Agenda Item 15.

risks to ERS posed by fishing for SBT, and mitigation of these risks. Members 
9 
 
were urged to take all relevant information to this meeting in order for the ERS 
Working Group to make those assessments. 
60. The meeting requested that the Executive Secretary discuss with the Chair of the 
ERS Working Group to further develop the draft agenda for this meeting (at 
Attachment 20) and distribute the Draft Provisional Agenda for Members’

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Good morning. 
 
First let me thank our hosts, the Indonesian Government for the warm welcome and 
for the superb meeting venue.  We would also like to acknowledge the Secretariat for 
the meeting papers and arrangements, which are of the usual high standard.  Most of 
our delegation took the opportunity yesterday to leave the hotel surrounds and see 
some of Bali, including volcanoes, batik making, monkeys, rice fields, temples, 
houses and some wallabies and springboks.  It was indeed a very pleasant day.   
 
This week’s meeting is the most important in the history of the Extended 
Commission.  At the end of this week we will have either succeeded or we will have 
failed; the reputation of this organisation, and the actions others may take in response, 
will depend on the decisions we take this week. 
 
In Australia’s view, success this week will be a consensus decision to adopt a 
precautionary management procedure that responds to the depleted state of the 
southern bluefin tuna spawning stock and secures its rebuilding. We place the 
emphasis on precautionary. Although there are some positive signs for rebuilding 
projections, they remain only that – projections. In Australia’s view we must deal with 
the immediate reality of the critically-low levels of the southern bluefin tuna 
spawning stock.  
 
While it is tempting to say that the scientists have told us that we can immediately 
increase current catches by almost 40 per cent and still reach our interim rebuilding 
target, our scientists have also warned us about the risks – both to the spawning stock 
and to the stability and viability of our industries – of taking such action at these early 
stages. In contrast, Australia is seeking a durable solution to the current status of 
southern bluefin tuna; one that builds on the very difficult decision the Extended 
Commission took in 2009. 
 
At our special meeting in August this year, we set out Australia’s priorities for the 
Extended Commission’s work and these remain relevant to our discussions this week. 
We believe the most important task we have this week is to finalise and adopt a 
precautionary management procedure, and to establish the global total allowable catch 
for the coming three years in accordance with that procedure. 
 
Of course the important third component of our work this week is to agree the 
national allocation of each Member and Co-operating non-Member within the total 
allowable catch.  For Australia, as a significant coastal range State for southern 
bluefin tuna with an important locally-based industry, this is a crucial issue. Despite 
the best efforts of this organisation, and the tens of millions of dollars that Australia 
alone has spent on scientific research, the southern bluefin stock has been 
significantly depleted over the past 20 years.  The circumstance we now collectively 
find ourselves in, and the main reasons for it, will be an important element in 
Australia’s approach to our discussions on the review of national allocations. 
 
This organisation has at times struggled to move past the annual focus on setting the 
total allowable catch and national allocations. It is Australia’s expectation that, if we 
can achieve our main tasks this week of adopting a management procedure, setting the 
total allowable catch for the next three years and stabilising national allocations, this 
will then allow the Extended Commission to turn its focus to other priorities.  For 
Australia, paramount among these is to first, address the impacts of fishing for 
southern bluefin tuna on ecologically-related species, such as sharks, seabirds and sea 
turtles, and secondly, to reduce the uncertainty in southern bluefin tuna mortalities in 
the distant water longline fishing fleets. 
 
In closing, let me again thank our Indonesian hosts and assure you all that Australia 
will continue to work constructively and cooperatively with all Members to ensure the 
Extended Commission achieves its important tasks this week. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen, Good 
morning. 
 
On behalf of my delegation, I would like to thank Indonesia for hosting this meeting 
and choosing this comfortable venue. I would also like to welcome the representatives 
of the Philippines, South Africa and European Community as Cooperating 
Non-Member and observers from Human Society International, TRAFFIC and 
U.S.-Japan Research Institute. 
 
Adoption of a Management Procedure and the rules that govern its operation is one of 
the main priorities for this meeting. In the Special Meeting held in Sydney this August, 
members have agreed to the “Bali Procedure” that was recommended by the Extended 
Scientific Committee. Therefore, we need to make decision for the associated MP 
parameters, such as tuning year, maximum TAC change, and etc. in this meeting. 
 
Total allowable catch (TAC) and its allocation is another important issue for this 
meeting. According to the result of full stock assessment made by the Extended 
Scientific Committee in Bali this July, it shows recent recruitments (2005-2011) are 
estimated to be higher than previous conditioning. Although the current spawning 
stock biomass (SSB) remains very low (0.03-0.07 SSB0), nevertheless, it will be 
sometime before the recent stronger recruitments enter the spawning stock. Model 
results indicate that the SSB is likely to increase after 2012. In such circumstance, we 
hope TAC and its allocation can be increased for the following year. 
 
The resolutions adopted by CCSBT, such as Catch Documentation Scheme, vessel 
monitoring system (VMS), transshipment by large-scale fishing vessels, record of 
authorized farms and vessels and etc. are in place to play key roles to ensure effective 
monitoring, control and surveillance. Right now, we should consider how to ensure 
effective implementation of such compliance measures. Besides, we should take into 
account of the feasibility and cost-effectiveness when we introduce any new 
measures. 
 
Finally, we look forward to working together with all members and co-operating 
non-members in the following days and getting fruitful outcomes during this meeting. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen 
 
On behalf of the Indonesia delegation, it is my great pleasure to welcome 
Distinguished Delegates, Chairman and Observer of 18 the Annual Meeting of the 
Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. At this 
occasion, please let me introduce Indonesia delegation composed of multy 
stakeholders represent the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, Tuna Longliner 
Operators, Indonesia Tuna Association - Jakarta, Indonesia Tuna Longline 
Association – Bali as well as Fisheries Scientist.  
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen 
 
I take this annual meeting is quite important in nature, since all members are going to 
discuss some important issues that will influence management actions of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna in the future.   
 
At this occasion, I need to address the issue regarding TAC. As we have discussed at 
the Special Meeting of the Extended Commission, there is an option to increase a 
TAC of 3,000 ton or 5,000 ton within three years management periods to come. In 
this regards, I propose to give a consideration in terms of equal benefits to members in 
respect to distribution of the additional TAC. I realize it is not as easy as I say to settle 
this issue as we need to understand each other as members. I welcome for the 
adoption of the new initiative that will lead to ensure the sustainability of SBT 
fisheries. 
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen 
 
Let me reiterate the meeting another issue that I request need to be considered. In fact 
there is a difference type of SBT fisheries among members, such as Indonesia, it’s 
fishing fleet is dominated by small scale longliner fishing vessels in term of vessel 
size. In certain month during a year, these kind of vessels may harvest SBT 
unexpectedly at the coastal water.  
 
We have made our effort to encourage them to comply with the resolutions, for 
instance, tagging and vessel registration scheme. But at the time being, I may inform 
the meeting that we still need some more time to get them all. For this reason, we 
have established a cooperation with tuna association as well as longliner operator to 
involve in this concern. I hope members may give positive consideration to this 
current situation.  
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen 
 
Last but no least, being a host of this meeting, we are apology for any inconvenience. 
And we very appreciate if all delegates may joint a welcome dinner to be hosted by 
Director General for Capture Fisheries this evening.    
 
Thank you very much and hoping to see you all this evening.

Opening Statement by Japan 
 
Thank you, Chair. On behalf of the Japanese delegation, let me make our opening 
statement. 
 
Firstly I would like to extend our thanks to the Indonesian government for hosting the 
CCSBT18 meeting in this beautiful island of Bali.  We hope we could manage to 
take time out from the busy meeting schedule to enjoy our stay in Bali. 
 
This year’s meeting is going to be a very busy one.  We are facing a lot of issues to 
discuss.  We have to discuss the Management Procedure (MP).  We have to make 
decisions on the pending issues of some parameters for the MP, including tuning year, 
maximum TAC change and a rule for a block quota over the three year TAC period.  
Furthermore, we must agree on the TAC for 2012 onward based on MP, and also must 
decide on its allocation among Members.  In addition, there are many other items to 
be addressed at this meeting, such as budgetary issues, relationship with Cooperating 
Non-Members and implementation of CCSBT Strategic Plan.       
 
The most challenging issues among these items will be adopting the MP, the so-called 
‘Bali Procedure’, which has been developed through the numerous efforts of many 
people over time, and making a decision on the TAC based on the MP and its 
allocation among Members over three years from 2012 to 2014. 
 
According to the stock assessment conducted by the Scientific Committee, the current 
spawning stock biomass is of concern.  However, recent data, including operational 
data, shows successful recruitment of juvenile fish and significant positive future 
catch projections.  The Extended Scientific Committee advised that if we manage the 
SBT stock based on the MP, “there is virtually no possibility of extinction of the 
stock” (Paragraph 129 of the 16th Meeting of Extended Scientific Committee report). 
 
We should continue our ongoing efforts to steadily rebuild SBT stock as a matter of 
priority due to the low level of the spawning stock biomass.  The MP will be the 
most important core tool of CCSBT for many decades, to achieve two objectives, 
stock recovery and stock utilisation, simultaneously.  It is essential for us to agree on 
a most appropriate MP.    
 
Although we still have concerns about the current spawning stock biomass, it is good 
news for us that the future projections have been greatly improved.  We believe our 
past efforts in CCSBT on conservation and management of southern bluefin tuna 
(SBT) resulted in this optimistic projections.  Now we can see these positive signs 
with the SBT stock for the first time in the history of CCSBT.  Deliberate 
considerations would be needed for CCSBT to achieve both goals of constant stock 
rebuilding and sustainable and maximum utilisation of the stock.  
 
Japan sincerely recognises that we should put a top priority on the stock rebuilding. 
We accepted a 50% reduction of our allocation over the last five years.  Two years 
ago, Japan also accepted an additional 20% reduction of its allocation at the annual 
meeting in Korea, while its allocation had been already decided to be at 3,000t.  This 
was not easy.  Our fishers have been heavily struggling to manage their fishing 
within such a low level of quota.  I wish to recall that at CCSBT13 it was agreed to 
simultaneously implement all the steps of the MOU reached at CCSBT1 relating to 
the national allocations of Australia, New Zealand and Japan.  Given this 
background, Japan would like to strongly request that recovery of Japan’s allocation 
in the event of TAC increase should be the priority for CCSBT. 
 
Thank you, Chair.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Tena kotou katoa 
 
Firstly on behalf of the New Zealand delegation let me extend our thanks to our hosts 
Indonesia for their welcome and the fine venue selected for this meeting.  I would also 
like to commend the work of the Executive Secretary and his team at the Secretariat 
and the members of the extended scientific committee who have provided excellent 
support during the current year. 
 
This Commission has had the support it needs and now must do its job.  In New 
Zealand’s opinion, that job is to ensure that the southern bluefin tuna stock is 
managed in a way that will ensure that it rebuilds and then remains at a long term 
sustainable level. 
 
New Zealand is committed to the adoption of a management procedure but insists that 
we do so in a precautionary manner.  Reflecting on the deliberations of the recent 
compliance committee New Zealand is even more convinced of the need to be 
extremely cautious in how we manage the stock in the short term until we see real, 
rather than projected, improvement in its status. 
 
New Zealand’s position is clear. The stock is at 5% of its original spawning biomass 
and predicted to decline further next year.  It is not the time to increase global catches 
as suggested by some of the management procedure options before us.  The scientific 
committee has given us these options at our request and has given us the information 
to assess the merits of each.  New Zealand interprets the advice of that committee as 
favouring no change in catch limit in the first period of the management procedure if 
adopted.  The diagnostics provided support this approach. 
 
New Zealand has no interest in an overly optimistic approach of adopting an increase 
in catch only to have to follow that in short time by a decrease.  Our industries will 
not thank us if we do not provide them the stability they need for their commercial 
operations.  If we do our job properly, they in turn will benefit from a steadily 
improving rebuild of the stock through increased catch rates and increased yields. 
 
Chair, I will not repeat the comments I made at this year’s special meeting regarding 
the international expectations of this Commission; they are a matter of record.  I will 
just say that it is New Zealand’s view that it is now time to show the world that this 
Commission has the interests of the stock foremost in our consideration 
 
Thank you

Opening Statement by Korea 
 
Selamatpagi, good morning, 
 
On behalf of the Korean delegation, I would like to extend my greetings to the 
distinguished Chair, Dr. Gofar, participants from other members and cooperating 
non-members and to observers.  
 
First and foremost, I thank the Indonesian government for hosting the 18th annual 
meeting of the CCSBT at this beautiful venue.  
 
As we are all aware, we have a very important decision to make at this meeting. That 
is adopting an MP, so called the “Bali Procedure” that will serve as a beacon for us to 
achieve our conservation and management goal. I understand that at the Special 
Meeting in Sydney, there was a general consensus that the Bali Procedure should be 
adopted this year, although the members had differing views on the details. With this 
general consensus, at least we have a good starting point on the way forward. Korea 
hopes that the Members will not diverge from this consensus that an MP should be 
adopted and strongly suggests that we put an MP into place from 2012. 
 
Mr. Chair, Korea believes in two principles that should be applied to our efforts in 
meeting our goal.  
 
First, we need to take precautionary measures. The report from the Extended 
Scientific Committee clearly states that even though the projection for future stock 
status is rather optimistic, the stock situation at the moment is still grim and uncertain. 
Korea’s interpretation on this is that we should not let down our guards until the 
science explicitly signals a green light. Or, all the arduous effort we have been 
extending so far to rebuild the stock will end up being in vain. 
 
The second principle Korea believes in is that we need to take operational stability 
into consideration. It will be problematic for fishers if there are too many ups and 
downs along the way. A high TAC in one quota block followed by a substantially 
reduced TAC would certainly not be what the fishers need. 
 
Keeping these two principles in mind, a right balance between conservation and 
optimal use can be stricken.  
 
Mr. Chair, the CCSBT is the organization well known to the world for its strict and 
well-managed conservation measures. I hope at this meeting, the Members can prove 
once again that the CCSBT can measure up to its good reputation by adopting an MP.  
 
Before closing, I would like to reiterate that it is not the right time for us to sit back 
and relax. Rather, we must take a precautionary approach in conserving and managing 
the SBT stock.  
 
I hope all members can produce good result at this meeting in a good spirit of 
cooperation. 
 
Thank you. 
Attachment 5-1 
 
Opening Statement by Philippines  
 
On behalf of the Philippine delegation, I would like to express our gratitude to the 
Government of Indonesia for the gracious hospitality extended to us and for hosting 
the 18th   Annual Meeting of the Commission on the Conservation of Southern Blue 
Fin Tuna (CCSBT) in this beautiful place of Bali, Indonesia. 
 
The Philippines as a cooperating non-member in the Commission for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) is committed to comply with the 
requirements and management measures established by the Commission. In the light 
of the new compliance action plan, the Philippines will exert more efforts to enhance 
monitoring and additional reporting methods, compliance to scientific observers, 
VMS, the Philippine Government may also designate foreign ports of transshipment 
in the future and ensure compliance on the implementation of ERS recommendations. 
 
Our industry is looking forward for a more productive fishing operations, and hoping 
that the condition of the SBT stock will improve in the near future.  
 
 In behalf of our industry, I would like to express our gratitude to the members for 
allowing our continued cooperating non-member status in the commission, and look 
forward renewal of such status in the succeeding year. Thank you. 
 
Thank you very much. 
 
Attachment 5-2 
 
Opening Statement by South Africa 
 
South Africa wishes to thank the Indonesian government for hosting the 2011 Annual 
Meetings of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in this 
beautiful location of Bali. We hope that the beauty and tranquility of Bali would assist 
us in focusing on the key issues at hand. We are also indebted to the secretariat staff 
for their tireless and professional support to Members and Co-operating Non-
Members alike.  
 
Since our first engagement in the CCSBT meetings 5 years ago we are pleased to see 
that the Commission, and indeed Parties,  is taking the conservation status of southern 
bluefin seriously by regularly implementing and reviewing sound fisheries 
management and compliance practices. This continued approach will surely improve 
the stock status to the benefit of all Parties. We understand that at this meeting we 
have to overcome one very important hurdle before we can set course on realizing our 
objectives and that is to adopt a robust management procedure and associated TAC 
and allocations thereof. 
 
Allocations in any fishery, whether it is local or international, are not easy tasks. 
South Africa has experience of quota allocations in both contexts and notes that this 
task can only be conducted in an objective and transparent basis, by considering the 
aspirations of all parties against a predefined set of allocation criteria. We note that 
CCSBT has developed such allocation criteria as part of the convention text, namely 
Article 8(4). In quoting this Article it states the following: 
 
“ In deciding upon allocations among the Parties under paragraph 3 above the 
Commission shall consider: 
 (b) the need for orderly and sustainable development of southern bluefin tuna 
fisheries; 
(c) the interests of Parties through whose exclusive economic or fishery zones 
southern bluefin tuna migrates; 
(d) the interests of Parties whose vessels engage in fishing for southern bluefin 
tuna including those which have historically engaged in such fishing and 
those which have southern bluefin tuna fisheries under development; 
(e) the contribution of each Party to conservation and enhancement of, and 
scientific research on, southern bluefin tuna.” 
 
In terms of bullet point b the commission has been made aware that the South African 
commercial tuna longline fishery has been in a developmental phase since 2005. 
Furthermore, the South African tuna longline fishery is one of the most regulated tuna 
longline fisheries in the world, which not only considers the sustainability of tuna and 
tuna-like species but has also adopted an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries which is a 
more holistic approach to fisheries management. 
 
In terms of bullet point c, South Africa is only one of four Parties represented here 
that has southern bluefin occurring in its waters. Furthermore, one of the most 
important longline fishing grounds straddles South Africa’s EEZ. Yet despite 
numerous efforts to have South Africa’s quota’s increased it has remained at 0.5% of 
the global TAC. 
 
In terms of bullet point d: South Africa currently has vessels catching southern 
bluefin, albeit as by-catch; South Africa has a historic catch record which dates back 
to the 1960s, and; South Africa has a domestic fishery under development. 
 
In terms of bullet point e: South Africa’s co-operation as a port state is vital to the 
conservation of the species when considering that 20% of the global TAC passes 
through our ports. 
 
South Africa believes it has made its aspirations clear and that it has gone over and 
beyond what is required for its request for a larger country allocation to be considered. 
We acknowledge that a larger allocation would only be implemented when South 
Africa accedes to the Convention. Earlier this year South Africa informed all Member 
Parties that it is in the process of acceding to the Convention, but Political Heads have 
required some assurance from CCSBT to an initial quota of 300-400 t (4% of the 
TAC) to be allocated upon accession and thereby providing meaningful benefits that 
would accrue to the country. We also expect the allocation to increase as the resource 
is rebuilt and thereby ensuring that South Africa’s portion of the TAC is more 
equitable. This can only be considered as a fair and modest request considering the 
status of the resource, the impact on other Parties, South Africa’s fleet and 
management capacity, and the CCSBT membership fees. To date South Africa has not 
received any official response to this request. We appreciate that deliberations are still 
ongoing, but we sadly note that transparency in this organization is lacking and that 
we have not been afforded an opportunity to properly engage with Member Parties on 
this issue. As these issues are expected to be deliberated again within the Heads of 
Delegations meeting, we would appreciate if Member Parties would agree to South 
Africa in providing a brief presentation to give support to our request before the 
Heads of delegations meeting. This presentation would also allow Member Parties to 
clarify any issues that pertains to South Africa’s request.  
 
 In closing, we wish all Member Parties cordial and productive deliberations.

Opening Statement by HSI  
 
HSI thanks Commission Members for the opportunity to participate as an observer to 
these important discussions.  
 
HSI endorses the sentiment expressed in the recommended Strategic Plan that the 
Management Procedure should be set to ensure the precautionary principle is applied 
and ecosystem management is incorporated. In accordance with this and the current 
low level of SBT stock, HSI sees no option than for Members to Accept the short-
term pain but look forward to the long-term gain by urgently reaching a decision on 
the most robust and precautionary MP and agree to not increase the TAC at this time. 
If Members disagree, then at least agree to a MP and TAC decisions that are 
calibrated to be as conservative and as precautionary as possible. 
 
During these times of urgent attention on conserving SBT stocks, it is recognised that 
equally important issues concerning ERS interactions can get left behind. HSI does, 
however, urge the Commission when considering Agenda Item 15 to ensure the ERS 
Working Group is given the specific direction needed so that the Commission can in 
turn resolve outstanding ERS issues. 
 
Despite what occurs at these meetings, little may actually be achieved unless change 
can be assured at sea for which incentives need to be developed such as linking TAC 
allocations at both national and individual vessel level to performance criteria as 
suggested in the development of the Compliance Policy Statements. Members’ 
obligations to both SBT and ERS must be central to discussions this week and HSI 
looks forward to participating in these discussions. 
 
Just to add a specific point in relation to addressing ERS issues, HSI is of the opinion 
that unless line weighting becomes the backbone of mitigation, the efforts to further 
reduce ERS interactions, particularly of seabirds, will be unsuccessful.  
 
Therefore, it is necessary for the column approach of mandatory and recommended 
measures to be reviewed as soon as possible. 
Attachment 6-2 
 
Opening Statement by TRAFFIC 
 
Thank you Mr Chairman. 
 
TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, and WWF thank the Commission 
for the opportunity to participate as observers to meetings of the Commission and 
the Extended Commission. We look forward to contributing to these critical 
deliberations. We urge Members to make the necessary decisions, with the required 
sense of urgency, to conserve effectively southern bluefin tuna and other 
ecologically related species, especially sharks, seabirds and marine turtles. 
 
As we stated during the Special meeting of the Extended Commission in Sydney in 
August this year, the number one priority for this Commission is to agree a robust 
management procedure this year that secures the return of the stock to a biologically 
safe level as quickly as possible, consistent with the application of the precautionary 
principle. 
 
It is also important for the Commission to make progress towards adopting binding 
measures to address serious bycatch issues for sharks, seabirds and marine turtles, 
with the recommendations from the Kobe III process for bycatch species a good first 
step. 
 
As many observers and Members stated at the Special Meeting in August the 
international community will be a harsh judge of the Commission if there is not 
action taken at this meeting to adopt a meaningful Management Procedure given that 
the spawning stock remains at historically low levels of around 5%. It is no threat, 
but simple reality that where a management body falters in making responsible 
decisions that the next responsible step is to look where management can be 
achieved and that may be to look for help from other types of international 
agreements including trade related ones such as CITES. 
 
We therefore urge the Commission to show it takes its responsibility seriously with 
regard to the sustainable management of tuna and ecologically related species and 
adopt a robust management procedure for SBT and conservation measures to protect 
sharks, seabirds and marine turtles. 
 
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

We aren’t voracious predators-2, who/se …..

Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
1 Mr Gordon Neil (Australia) was agreed by Members to be the Chair of the 
Finance and Administration Committee (FAC). The Chair proposed a general 
agenda, which was agreed by the FAC. 
 
2 The FAC discussed the revised budget for 2011, and the proposed budget for 
2012, including the creation of a new position (Compliance Manager) and the 
Australian proposal for shared funding of the scientific aerial survey. 
 
Finance 
 
The revised budget for 2011 
 
3 The Executive Secretary gave a summary of the 2011 revised budget, highlighting 
an expected decrease in expenditure of 12 per cent over the approved 2011 
budget. The revised budget was provided in paper CCSBT-EC/1110/05. It is 
proposed that a surplus of $243 000 projected for 2011 will be carried into the 
2012 budget as income. The FAC thanked the Executive Secretary for the work 
done on the budget. 
 
4 The FAC recommends that the revised budget for 2011at Annex A be agreed by 
the Extended Commission. 
 
The proposed budget for 2012 
 
5 The FAC considered the proposed budget for 2012 as outlined in CCSBT-
EC/1110/06. 
 
6 The Executive Secretary explained that the draft 2012 budget has increased by 
approximately 20% and explained the reasons for this increase. In large part, the 
proposed budget increase was due to the inclusion of funds for an additional 
Secretariat staff member (a compliance manager) and higher meeting costs for the 
2012 Tokyo meetings relative to the 2011 Bali meetings. 
 
7 The Executive Secretary noted that as the Extended Commission had agreed not to 
hold a meeting of the Strategic and Fisheries Management Working Group 
(SFMWG) in 2012, there will be a saving of $77,400 from that proposed in the 
2012 budget.  
 
8 The FAC considered a number of cost savings identified in CCSBT-EC/1110/06. 
In an effort to reduce the Extended Commission’s costs, the FAC recommends 
the following to the Extended Commission, that: 
(i) 
The annual meeting of the Extended Scientific Committee is reduced from 
6 days to 5 in 2012. This would amount to a saving of approximately 
$28,800. 
(ii) 
The Chair of the ERSWG does not attend the 19th annual Extended 
Commission meeting. This would amount to a saving of approximately 
$19,300. 
(iii) 
Members are provided electronic copies of ERS pamphlets, and organize 
printed copies at their own expense, instead of the Secretariat printing 
copies. This would amount to a saving of approximately $60,100.  
(iv) 
3 officers from the Secretariat, rather than 4, attend the annual meeting of 
the Extended Commission. This would amount to a saving of 
approximately $11,700.  
 
9 The FAC also discussed whether savings could be realised by no longer funding 
the chair of the Extended Scientific Committee to attend the Extended 
Commission on an annual basis, and to fund the chair of the Compliance 
Committee’s attendance at the Extended Commission for only 1 day. No 
agreement was reached on this issue, but the FAC requested that the Secretariat 
prepare a business case reviewing the attendance of both chairs at the annual 
meeting of the Extended Commission, so that potential savings could be reviewed 
in 2012. 
 
Appointment of a Compliance Manager 
 
10 The Executive Secretary noted that the Secretariat staff are fully utilised and have 
little capacity to take on extra functions. Agreement was sought on the 
appointment of a Compliance Manager to the Secretariat staff commencing in 
2012. 
 
11 There was general acknowledgement among members of the need for such a 
position within the Secretariat. The FAC recommends to the Extended 
Commission that the appointment of a Compliance Manager to the Secretariat be 
funded. 
 
Shared funding of scientific aerial survey 
 
12 The FAC discussed Australia’s proposal for partial shared funding of the scientific 
aerial survey.  Members thanked Australia for its undertaking of the scientific 
aerial survey of juvenile SBT. There was some support from Members to the idea 
of partially contributing to the costs of the scientific aerial survey, but no 
agreement on this item was reached. 
 
Additional costs 
 
13 The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission subscribes to a trade 
database at the cost of $1,000 per year. 
 
14 The FAC discussed whether the Advisory Panel for the Extended Scientific 
Committee should be reduced from 3 members to 2 as of 2012, as advised would 
be acceptable by the Extended Scientific Committee in July 2011.Members agreed 
that 3 panel Members would be funded for 2012, with the third panel member to 
chair the CPUE working group. However, one Member made the point that there 
was little value to CCSBT in funding a third panel member simply for the purpose 
of chairing the CPUE working group considering that raw data were not available 
to Members or to the Advisory Panel, and that this role could be filled by a 
national scientist. The panel membership will be reviewed again in 2012. 
 
15 The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission continue to fund a 3-
member Advisory Panel in 2012, with the issue to be reconsidered by the FAC at 
its annual meeting in 2012. 
 
16 The FAC also discussed the funds required to conduct a two-year trial audit of 
Members on a volunteer basis, as recommended by the 6th meeting of the 
Compliance Committee. New Zealand expressed its strong support for the trial 
audit of Members. However, it was noted that no Member had volunteered to be 
audited, and the trial audit was considered by most Members to be of lower 
priority than the appointment of the Compliance Manager to the Secretariat staff. 
The FAC did not support the funding of the proposed trial audit.  
 
Recommended Budget 2012 
 
17 The FAC agreed to recommend the General Budget for the Extended Commission 
in 2012 as set out in Annex 2 to this document.

Resolution on the Adoption of a Management Procedure 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
 
Seized by the need to ensure the conservation and optimum utilisation of southern 
bluefin tuna based on the best available scientific advice, 
 
Taking account of the current status of the stock and, in particular, the most recent 
stock assessment from the Extended Scientific Committee advising that the spawning 
stock biomass is between 3% and 7% of the original spawning stock biomass,  
 
Determined to rebuild the status of spawning stock to an interim building target 
reference point of 20% of the original spawning stock biomass by 2035, 
 
Taking account of the integrated management procedure developed by the Extended 
Scientific Committee at its annual meeting in July 2011, 
 
Recalling the Resolution on the Total Allowable Catch and Future Management of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna adopted by the Extended Commission at its annual meeting in 
2009, 
 
Further to the Resolution on the Allocation of the Global Total Allowable Catch 
adopted by the Extended Commission at its annual meeting in 2011, 
 
Recognising the obligations of each Member and Co-operating Non-Member to take 
the necessary steps to ensure that the level of its catch complies with its national 
allocation and to give effect to the Resolutions adopted by the Extended Commission. 
 
In accordance with paragraph 3(a) of Article 8 of the Convention for the Conservation 
of Southern Bluefin Tuna, the Extended Commission decides as follows: 
 
1. The Extended Commission adopts the Management Procedure (MP), the ‘Bali 
Procedure’, developed by the Extended Scientific Committee at its annual 
meeting in 2011 and incorporating the meta-rule process described in 
Attachment 10 of the 15th Report of the Extended Scientific Committee. 
 
2. The MP shall be used to guide the setting of the global total allowable catch 
(TAC) to ensure the SBT spawning stock biomass achieves the interim 
rebuilding target. 
 
3. The Extended Commission shall set the TAC based on the outcome of the MP, 
unless the Extended Commission decides otherwise based on information that 
is not otherwise incorporated into the Management Procedure. 
 
4. The MP shall be used to guide the setting of the TAC for 2012 and beyond. 
 
5. The MP will recommend the TAC for 2012-2014 inclusive (i.e. no lag), but 
after that, there will be a one year lag between TAC calculation by the MP and 
implementation of that TAC (i.e. the 2015-2017 TAC would be calculated in 
2013). 
 
6. The parameters of the MP shall be as follows: 
 
(i) 
To rebuild the status of stock to an interim building target reference 
point of 20% of the original spawning stock biomass by 2035; 
 
(ii) 
The MP shall be tuned to a 70% probability of achieving the interim 
rebuilding target; 
 
(iii) 
The minimum increase or decrease TAC change shall be 100 tonnes; 
 
(iv) 
The maximum increase or decrease TAC change shall be 3000 tonnes; 
 
(v) 
The TAC shall be set for three-year periods, subject to  
paragraph 7; and 
 
(vi) 
The national allocation of the TAC within each three-year period will 
be apportioned according to the Resolution on the Allocation of the 
Global Total Allowable Catch1. 
 
7. For the first three-year TAC setting period (2012-2014): 
 
(i) 
The TAC for 2012 shall be 10, 449 tonnes. This is an increase of 1000 
tonnes above the 2010-2011 TAC of 9, 449 tonnes;  
 
(ii) 
The TAC for 2013 shall be 10, 949 tonnes. This is an increase of  
1, 500 tonnes above the 2010-2011 TAC of 9, 449 tonnes; and 
 
(iii) 
The TAC for 2014 shall be 12, 449 tonnes or the output of the MP for 
2015 - 2017 based on the 2013 stock assessment (whichever is the 
less), unless the Extended Commission decides otherwise based on the 
assessment of the Compliance Committee. This increase is based on 
the 2010-2011 TAC of 9, 449 tonnes.

Attachment 13 
 
Resolution on Limited Carry-forward of Unfished Annual Total Allowable 
Catch of Southern Bluefin Tuna within Three Year Quota Blocks 
(Adopted at the eighteenth Annual Meeting – 10-13 October 2011) 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Noting the “Resolution on the Adoption of a Management Procedure” was adopted at 
the eighteenth annual meeting in 2011; 
 
Further noting that this resolution adopts a management procedure that will set the 
global total allowable catch (TAC) for southern bluefin tuna in three year blocks; 
 
Considering the need to manage within these three year quota blocks and to allow 
some carry-forward of Member’s annual TAC; 
 
Recognising that a provision to carry-forward undercatch can benefit the fishery by 
providing catch flexibility between quota years within a three year quota block; 
 
Mindful that this carry-forward provision may present administrative complexities for 
some Members, and that it should therefore be up to each Member whether it wishes 
to implement the provision for its vessels; 
 
Agrees in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8, that: 
 
Section 1: Establishment of a Carry-forward Procedure 
 
1. The Extended Commission hereby establishes a procedure for limited carry-
forward of Members’ un-fished annual TAC1 from one year to the next. This 
procedure will apply within, but not between, the three year quota blocks agreed 
under the Extended Commission’s management procedure (as per the Resolution 
on the Adoption of a Management Procedure). 
2. Members shall determine whether or not to adopt the carry-forward procedure for 
their fishery. However, if a Member adopts the carry-forward procedure in this 
resolution such carry-forward shall be conducted in accordance with the 
procedures defined in sections 2 – 5 below.  
Section 2: Carry-Forward Procedure 
 
3. If a Member’s annual TAC is under-caught, that Member may carry forward this 
unfished quota to the next quota year. However, the total quota carried forward 
from one year to the next shall not exceed 20% of a Member’s annual TAC. 
4. Un-fished quota may only be carried forward from one quota year to the next and 
cannot be carried between three year quota blocks.  Quota that is carried forward 
                                            
1 Annual TAC means the agreed national allocation for each Member set by CCSBT. 
 
 
 
 
from one quota year may not in turn generate further under-fishing to be carried 
forward to the following year2. 
Section 3: Notification and Reporting of Carry-Forward Procedure 
 
5. If at the beginning of a new quota year a Member decides to, in accordance with 
this resolution, carry forward unfished quota from the previous quota year, it shall 
notify the CCSBT Secretariat of this carry-forward and provide a revised annual 
available catch limit3 for the new quota year. This notification shall be provided to 
the Secretariat within the first 60 days of the new quota year.   
6. Members that adopt the carry-forward procedure shall report on their use of the 
procedure in their annual reports to the Extended Commission, regardless of 
whether the procedure was in fact used by the Member during that quota year. 
Section 4: Circumstances When Carry-Forward Is Not Applicable 
7. If, on the basis of advice from the Extended Scientific Committee that exceptional 
circumstances exist that necessitate additional management action, the Extended 
Commission agrees to reduce the global total allowable catch within a three year 
quota block, the carry-forward procedures provided in this resolution shall not be 
applied by any Member.4 
8. If the Extended Commission agrees within a three year quota block to reduce the 
national allocation of one or more Member, that Member shall not apply the carry-
forward procedures provided in this resolution.  
Section 5: General Provisions 
9. The procedures in this resolution shall be applicable from 2012 . 
 
                                            
2 That is, you cannot generate carryover on a previously carried over amount. 
3 An annual available catch limit means the annual TAC plus any carry-forward of 
unfished catch from the previous year. 
4 Members should note that this could result in a loss of carried over catch.

South Africa’s presentation outline to CCSBT 18 in support of South Africa’s 
request for a larger quota 
 
Introduction 
With the inception and democratisation of South Africa and the end of apartheid in 
1994 a number of strategic interventions had to occur with regards to refocusing key 
economic sectors and utilization of natural resources for the benefit of all the people 
of South Africa. After 1994, and the advent of democracy, the new government 
expressed the intent to overhaul the rights allocation system and transform the fishing 
industry. Green and White Papers and new legislation (the Marine Living Resources 
Act,  1998) were introduced to set the broad guidelines on how fisheries were to be 
managed and transformed.  
South Africa is a developing country and is faced with key challenges of 
unemployment, economic growth, food insecurity and poverty. The Government has 
heeded the call and is paying particular attention to these challenges. As such, 
Fisheries has been identified as a priority for the country towards food security, job 
creation and economic growth. 
South Africa has over and above met all the requirements of CCSBT in implementing 
its conservation and management measures noting that SBT is managed under the 
“international common property law”. However, for South Africa to develop its 
domestic tuna fishing fishery an equitable allocation of the SBT resource is required. 
This will also bring about capacity building and skills transfer. The Convention is 
urged to create an enabling environment in this regards by allowing equitable entry in 
the SBT fishery for South Africa to meaningfully participate. The request is 
substantiated by a number of reasons and each of these will now be fully explained:  
 
Catch History 
The South African commercial longline fishery started in 1961 and lasted until 1967. 
During this time significant quantities of southern bluefin were caught within South 
Africa’s EEZ. The most reliable figure indicates that as much as 400 t were landed per 
annum. 
During the period 1964-1967, Japan together with Taiwan was fishing in the waters 
adjacent to South Africa and it is reported that the Japanese fleet alone deployed 22 
million hooks during this period and caught over 2 million tuna. 
From 1970s – 2002 South Africa had entered into bi-lateral fishing agreements with 
Japan and Taiwan, where up to 200 longline vessels were licensed to fish inside South 
Africa’s EEZ for tuna, including southern bluefin tuna. In 2002 all bi-lateral fishing 
agreements were terminated and a decision was taken by the South African 
government that marine resources in South African waters should be exploited for the 
benefit of South African nationals. 
It was only in 1997 that South Africa revisited longlining for tuna when 30 
experimental permits were issued. This fishery mainly focused on the targeting of 
swordfish. 
In 2005 the fishery was commercialised with the allocation of 50 long-term fishing 
rights. The fishery was initially limited to 45 t of southern bluefin, which was later 
reduced to 40 t by CCSBT. Given the small national quota southern bluefin tuna is 
caught as by-catch to targeting swordfish, yellowfin, and bigeye.  
The South African longline fishery has had a punctuated history of catching southern 
bluefin tuna, but when considering fishing activity by foreign longline vessels as well 
in our waters then it can be argued that fishing for southern bluefin tuna inside South 
Africa’s EEZ has had a long and continuous history dating back to the 1960s. 
 
Current Fishing Capacity 
50 long-term Commercial Longline Fishing Rights have been allocated to South 
African fishing companies in 2005, which translates to a maximum of 50 longline 
vessels. No foreign entities are allowed to hold commercial fishing rights for South 
African waters. 
Between 26-30 vessels, ranging in length from 18-45m, have annually engaged in 
fishing activity, which includes 10-12 vessels under charter. 
The charter programme has been established in order to facilitate skills transfer and 
reflagging of vessels to South Africa. 
 The current allocation translates to a mere 0.8 t per South African fishing right 
holder. With such a small quota it is not viable for fishers to target this resource. 
Rather SBT is caught as by-catch to yellowfin and bigeye. Increasing the sbt quota 
would not only make current fishing companies more viable but would also provide 
the stimulus needed for inactive right holders to activate their fishing rights. 
An increase in the southern bluefin tuna quota is estimated to double the current South 
African jobs in the tuna longline.  
 
Status as a range state  
Of the 9 countries represented at CCSBT, South Africa is one of only four countries 
that have southern bluefin occurring in its waters, but has less than 0.5% of the TAC 
The General Provisions of UNCLOS (Article 193) acknowledges the sovereign rights 
of states to exploit the natural resources found inside its EEZ.  
 Furthermore, the Convention text of CCSBT also acknowledges this sovereign right. 
Kobe has also highlighted that consideration should be given to developing coastal 
states.  
For the last five years South Africa as a responsible fishing state has opted not to 
exercise its sovereign rights under UNCLOS but rather to co-operate with CCSBT 
and adhere to its quota allocation despite the inequity of its allocation. 
 
Flag state responsibly 
Full VMS coverage 
Observer coverage exceeds 70% 
ERS interactions (sharks, seabirds and turtles) are recorded and reported to the 
relevant RFMOs 
Logbooks have been implemented 
Ports for landing tuna have been designated 
All landings are monitored in South Africa 
Transshipments at sea are not permitted 
CDS documentation and tagging have been implemented 
South Africa reports its fisheries and trade data to CCSBT 
Hence, South Africa is responsible in the management of its resources and can be 
trusted to manage a larger allocation. 
 
Importance as a Port State 
South Africa is the most important port state in the CCSBT, with approximately 20% 
of the global TAC landed in our ports annually. This is due to one of the largest 
longline fishing grounds for Southern bluefin found adjacent to South Africa.  
South Africa has unilaterally and at its own costs implemented port state measures to 
ensure that its ports are not used as ports of convenience for illegal southern bluefin 
product to enter the market.  
South Africa has also co-operated with Member Parties to improve communication 
and to close the loophole for IUU southern bluefin tuna product. 
Hence, South Africa as a port state plays a vital role in the conservation of the 
resource.    
  
South Africa’s request 
All parties were informed earlier this year that South Africa was in the process of 
acceding to CCSBT, but political heads required some assurance of what our initial 
quota upon accession would be. South Africa indicated that it required an initial 
allocation of between 300-400 t.  This increase would only represent 3-4% of the 
global TAC. This modest request carefully considered the state of the resource, the 
interest of other parties, South Africa’s fleet capacity and CCSBT membership fees. 
We also expect that as the stock status improves that South Africa’s portion of the 
TAC would be adjusted accordingly. Hence, we would like to reiterate that the 
position of South Africa has not changed. We also expect that our modest request 
would be favourably considered especially when considering that South Africa meets  
the criteria for allocation under Article 8(4) of the Convention text.

Resolution on the Allocation of the Global Total Allowable Catch 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
 
Seized by the need to ensure the conservation and optimum utilisation of southern 
bluefin tuna based on the best available scientific advice, 
 
Recalling agreement reached on nominal catch levels at the 16th annual meeting of the 
Extended Commission meeting and the Resolution on the Total Allowable Catch and 
Future Management of Southern Bluefin Tuna adopted at that meeting, 
 
Further recalling the decisions of the Extended Commission adopted at its annual 
meeting in 2006,  
 
Further to the Resolution on the Adoption of a Management Procedure adopted at the 
annual meeting of the Extended Commission in 2011, 
 
Noting that the Management Procedure will be the basis for setting the total allowable 
catch from 2012, 
 
Taking into account the desirability of a transparent and stable process for allocating 
total allowable catch to Members and Cooperating Non-Members, which provides 
greater certainty to Members and Cooperating non-Members, in particular for their 
fishing industries, and facilitates the administration of national allocations, 
 
Recalling the Extended Commission agreed at it special meeting in 2011 to principles 
that would apply to the distribution of any increase in the global total allowable catch 
under the Management Procedure, 
 
Further recalling that one of the agreed principles at that meeting was to develop a 
process for returning Japan’s national allocation of the TAC to its nominal 
percentage,  
 
In accordance with paragraph 3(a) of Article 8 of the Convention for the Conservation 
of Southern Bluefin Tuna, the Extended Commission decides as follows: 
 
1. 
The total allowable catch (TAC) set on the basis of the Management 
Procedure (MP)1 shall be allocated among Members and Cooperating Non-
Members according to this Resolution.   
 
2. 
This Resolution shall be applied until allocations of all Members have 
returned to their nominal catch levels and will be applied from the first three-
year TAC setting period under the MP, i.e. 2012 – 2014.  
 
                                                        
1The Management Procedure agreed to under the Resolution on the Adoption of a Management 
Procedure adopted at the annual meeting of the Extended Commission in 2011. 
3. 
Unless this Resolution provides otherwise, the TAC shall be allocated among 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members as set out below. 
 
4. 
Before any increase in the TAC is apportioned between Members the total 
absolute tonnages outlined in paragraph 10 will be allocated to Cooperating 
Non-Members and, from the 2012 TAC period, the voluntary reductions made 
by Australia and New Zealand (255 tonnes and 45 tonnes respectively) will be 
returned.  
 
5. 
If there is no change to the TAC, each Member’s allocation will remain 
unchanged. 
 
 
6. 
If there is an increase to the TAC, the additional tonnage will be allocated 
amongst the Members based on the nominal percentage level as agreed in 
2009 and set out in the Annex to this Resolution. Where a Member reaches its 
nominal catch level, it shall be held at that level until all other Members reach 
their nominal catch levels. 
 
7. 
If there is a decrease to the TAC, each Member’s allocation will decrease 
consistent with its nominal percentage level. 
 
8. 
Each Cooperating Non-Member shall receive a fixed amount of the TAC, 
subject to the annual review of their status as a Cooperating Non-Member. 
 
9. 
The allocation of TAC may be revised with the entry of new Members and 
Cooperating Non-Members. The nominal catch levels will remain unchanged 
with the entry of new Members or Cooperating Non-Members, but the 
nominal percentage levels may change. 
 
10. 
The allocation of TAC for 2012, 2013 and 2014 for Members and Cooperating 
Non-Members shall be as follows:

2 As agreed in paragraph 7(iii) of the Resolution on the Adoption of the Management Procedure 
adopted at the annual meeting of the Extended Commission in 2011, the TAC for 2014 shall be 12, 449 
tonnes or the output of the MP for 2015 - 2017 based on the 2013 stock assessment (whichever is the 
less), unless the Extended Commission decides otherwise based on the assessment of the Compliance 
Committee. 
3 The Extended Commission agreed at its special meeting of the Extended Commission in 2011 that a 
process would be developed for returning Japan’s national allocation of the TAC to its nominal 
percentage. To commence the return to its nominal catch level, Japan shall receive a positive 
adjustment of its national allocation for 2014 of 10 percent of the increase subject to the TAC 
increasing to 12,449 tonnes and a compliance review at CCSBT 20 (2013). 
4 The increase in South Africa’s tonnage in 2013 and 2014 is subject to its accession to the Convention 
for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.  In the case that South Africa does not accede to the 
Convention, any additional tonnage will be apportioned to Members according to their nominal catch 
percentage levels.

DRAFT New Zealand Resolution on Reporting all Sources of Mortality of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna 
(Proposed at the eighteenth Annual Meeting – 10-13 October 2011) 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Recalling previous agreement by Members and Cooperating Non-Members to report 
all sources of mortality of southern bluefin tuna recorded in the report of Eleventh 
Commission Meeting and the Fifth Compliance Committee Meeting; 
 
Considering the value Members and Cooperating Non-Members see in recording 
these previous commitments in a resolution of the Extended Commission to ensure 
the data and reporting requirements for all sources of mortality are clear; 
 
Further recalling the CCSBT Strategic Plan adopted at the 2011 Special Meeting of 
the Extended Commission; 
 
Noting that in the Strategic Plan Members and Cooperating Non-Members accorded 
‘very high priority’ to agreeing rules that ensure members report accurate and 
complete data on all sources of mortality for southern bluefin tuna; 
 
Recognising the importance that this data is considered by the Extended Scientific 
Committee; 
 
Agrees in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8, that: 
1. All Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall, subject to paragraph 2, report 
accurate and complete data on the quantity of all sources of southern bluefin tuna 
mortality in their national reports presented to the Extended Commission. 
2. If a Member or Cooperating Non-Member is unable to provide complete and 
accurate data as required in paragraph 1 of this resolution, they shall report a best 
estimate of all sources of southern bluefin tuna mortality in their national report to 
the Extended Commission. 
3. For the purposes of this resolution “all sources of mortality” shall be understood to 
include, but not be limited to, discards and recreational fishing, including the fate 
–live and vigorous; moribund; dead – of these sources of southern bluefin tuna. 
4. The Secretariat will expand the table of compliance with measures, which is 
currently provided by the Secretariat to the annual Compliance Committee, to 
accommodate the reporting of all sources of southern bluefin tuna mortality. 
5. The Extended Scientific Committee shall incorporate the data on all sources of 
southern bluefin mortality provided in Member’s and Cooperating Non-Member’s 
national reports into their work, including future assessments. 
Attachment 17 
 
Recommendation to Mitigate the Impact on Ecologically Related Species of 
Fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna 
(Updated at the Eighteenth Annual Meeting – 10-13 October 2011) 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Concerned that some seabird species, notably albatrosses and petrels, are threatened 
with global extinction, 
 
Mindful that fishing for southern bluefin tuna can also cause incidental harm to other 
species such as sea turtles and sharks, 
 
Recalling the definition of ecologically related species in Article 2 of the Convention 
for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Further recalling the requirement in Article 5(2) of the Convention for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna that the Parties shall expeditiously provide to 
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna data on, inter alia, 
ecologically related species. 
 
Determined to mitigate incidental harm to ecologically related species caused by 
fishing for southern bluefin tuna, 
 
Noting the importance of harmonising conservation and management measures with 
other organisations responsible for managing international fisheries, as agreed at the 
Kobe Meeting of Joint Tuna RFMOs on 26 January 2007, 
 
Reaffirming the recommendation at the seventh meeting of the Ecologically Related 
Species Working Group (ERSWG) held in Tokyo from 3 to 6 July 2007, that 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members will provide national reports on their 
interactions with ecologically related species in southern bluefin tuna fisheries to the 
ERSWG, 
Recommends that: 
 
1. 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members will, to the extent possible, implement 
the International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catches of Seabirds in 
Longline Fisheries (IPOA-Seabirds), the International Plan of Action for the 
Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA-Sharks), and the FAO Guidelines to 
reduce sea turtle mortality in fishing operations (FAO-Sea turtles), if they have not 
already done so. 
2. 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members will comply with all current binding 
and recommendatory measures aimed at the protection of ecologically related species, 
including seabirds, sea turtles and sharks, from fishing, which are adopted from time 
to time: 
a) 
by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, when fishing in its Convention 
area,  
b) 
by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, when fishing in 
its Convention area, and 
c) 
by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, 
when fishing in its Convention area 
irrespective of whether the Member or Cooperating Non-Member concerned is a 
member of the relevant Commission or otherwise cooperates with it. 
3.   Members and Cooperating Non-Members will collect and report data on 
ecologically related species to the Extended Commission and/or its subsidiary bodies 
as appropriate, including the Ecologically Related Species Working Group.  Further, 
the undertaking described in paragraph 2 will include a commitment to comply with 
measures adopted by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the Western and Central 
Pacific Fisheries Commission and the International Commission for the Conservation 
of Atlantic Tunas on the collection and reporting of data in relation to ecologically 
related species.  Data confidentiality shall be protected under the rules that apply in 
those Commissions. 
4.   Members and Cooperating Non-Members will report annually to the 
Compliance Committee of the Extended Commission on the action they have taken 
pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this recommendation. 
5.  
The Secretariat of the CCSBT is authorised to collect and exchange relevant 
data concerning ecologically related species with the Secretariat of the Indian Ocean 
Tuna Commission, the Secretariat of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 
Commission and the Secretariat of the International Commission for the Conservation 
of Atlantic Tunas. 
6.  
The Extended Commission will review the operation of this Recommendation 
with a view to enhancing the protection of ecologically related species from the 
impacts of fishing for southern bluefin tuna. 
7.  
The Extended Commission and/or its subsidiary bodies as appropriate will 
undertake an assessment of the risks to ecologically related species posed by fishing 
for southern bluefin tuna.  The Extended Commission will consider how these risks 
are mitigated by the adoption of measures described at section 2, and will consider 
whether any additional measures to mitigate risk are required.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Attachment 18-1 
 
Report from the CCSBT observer to meetings of the Western and Central 
Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) held since the 17th annual meeting of the 
CCSBT, 2010 – 2012 
 
At CCSBT17 it was agreed that New Zealand would act as a CCSBT observer to 
meetings of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) in 
2010–11.  The following meetings of WCPFC have taken place since CCSBT17: 
• The annual Commission meeting, 6–10 December 2010 
• A meeting of the Scientific Committee, 9–17 August 2011 
• A meeting of the Technical and Compliance Committee, 28 September – 4 
October 20111 
 
Key WCPFC tuna stocks are taken as a bycatch of SBT longline fisheries. The status 
of these stocks is therefore a matter of relevance to CCSBT, and is summarised as 
follows: 
• Skipjack – the largest fishery by volume is assessed as not overfished and no 
overfishing is occurring at current levels of fishing effort. 
• Bigeye tuna – taken as target species in longline fisheries and as bycatch in 
equatorial purse seine fisheries.  Bigeye is assessed as not overfished, but 
overfishing is occurring at current levels of fishing effort. 
• Albacore (the south west Pacific stock) – no overfishing at current levels of 
fishing effort and not overfished. 
• Yellowfin – not overfished and no overfishing is occurring according to base 
case estimates, however the Scientific Committee has recommended there be 
no increase in fishing mortality in the equatorial region of the fishery. 
 
A focus of attention for WCPFC in the current year is the revision of the key 
conservation measure that applies to bigeye and yellowfin and its extension to also 
cover the skipjack fishery.  The existing measure has not been successful in achieving 
the required reduction in fishing effort for bigeye to arrest overfishing of this stock. 
 
A further issue of relevance to CCSBT is whether members are in compliance with 
the measures implemented by WCPFC in relation to ecologically related species.  
These measures currently relate to sharks, seabirds and sea turtles.  A “compliance 
with measures paper” developed by the Secretariat for consideration at the Technical 
and Compliance Committee provides information with which to make this 
assessment.  This report is publically available on the WCPFC website.2

time of drafting.

Report from the CCSBT Observer (Australia) 
to the 29th ANNUAL meeting of the 
Commission for the Conservation of 
Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
 
The twenty-ninth meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic 
Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR XXIX) was held in Hobart, Tasmania from 25 
October to 5 November 2011. 
 
The meeting was attended by representatives of all 25 Members of the Commission: 
Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, People’s Republic of China (hereafter referred 
to as China), Chile, European Union, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Republic 
of Korea, Namibia, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Russian Federation, South Africa, 
Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
United States of America and Uruguay. The Netherlands attended as a Contracting 
Party with observer status. The Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC) and 
the Coalition of Legal Toothfish Operators (COLTO) attended as invited NGO 
observers.  Several international organisations were also represented. Nigeria 
attended as a non-Contracting Party with observer status.  
 
Cooperation between CCAMLR and CCSBT 
The Commission recalled that the issue of an MOU with CCSBT has been under 
discussion in that Commission for some time but that further progress was not made 
in the intersessional period. Given the number of areas of common interest between 
CCAMLR and CCSBT, the Commission looked forward to receiving an update at 
CCAMLR-XXX.  
 
The Commission agreed that Australia would represent CCAMLR at the 18th Annual 
Meeting of CCSBT, incorporating the Extended Commission from 10 - 13 October 
2011, to be held in Bali, Indonesia. 
 
CCSBT has been invited to CCAMLR XXX. 
 
Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing 
The Commission expressed its concern that the estimates of IUU catch for the 
Convention Area had risen since 2009 and concluded that, despite progress in the 
control of nationals and the implementation of the Catch Documentation Scheme 
(CDS), IUU fishing did not appear to be significantly declining.  
 
The Commission agreed that, given the uncertainty surrounding gillnet catch rates, 
future estimates of IUU should focus on the level of effort, rather the level of catches. 
The CCAMLR Secretariat will also clarify, in future, whether zero IUU estimates in a 
specific area arise from a lack of information or confirmed zero IUU activity. 
 
Performance Review 
The Commission considered and reported on progress made on the recommendations 
from the 2008 Performance Review of CCAMLR. The Commission noted that the 
Scientific Committee had developed a road map that addressed recommendations 
from the Performance Review. Significant progress had been made in relation to 
addressing many of those recommendations including in relation to capacity building 
and burden sharing and that the recently endorsed three-year work plan for the 
Scientific Committee would take up additional matters raised by the Panel. Similarly 
the Commission endorsed a number of priorities identified by the Standing 
Committee on Implementation and Compliance (SCIC) including Flag and Port State 
duties and Monitoring Control and Surveillance requirements. The Commission 
endorsed the maintenance of the progress report as a dynamic, living document and a 
reference point for ongoing work.   
 
The Commission welcomed the outcomes of an IUU capacity building training event 
in South Africa jointly convened by Australia, the CCAMLR Secretariat, South 
Africa and the UK. The Commission noted that this was a useful exercise to 
strengthen cooperation with other Parties and help achieve the objectives of the 
Convention.     
 
Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) 
The Commission endorsed the terms of reference and potential workshop outputs 
from an MPA Workshop to be hosted in France in 2011. The objective of the 
workshop was to review progress, share experiences on different approaches to the 
selection of candidate sites for protection, review draft proposals for MPAs in the 
CAMLR Convention Area and determine a program of work to identify MPAs in as 
many of the priority regions as soon as possible.  
 
By-catch and incidental mortality  
The Commission noted the Scientific Committee’s general advice on incidental 
mortality of seabirds and marine mammals. The Commission noted that seabird 
mortality continues to be low and there were no cases marine mammal mortality in 
the 2009/10 period. France informed the Commission of the success it has had in 
implementing its national plan of action to reduce seabird incidental mortality within 
EEZs, which has been ongoing for three consecutive years. This has resulted in the 
significant reduction in the level of seabird mortalities by 84% from 2006/07 to 
2009/10. France invited all CCAMLR Members to consider taking action on this 
matter in RFMOs adjacent to the CAMLR Convention Area.  
 
Review of the Secretariat Strategic Plan 
At CCAMLR XXIX the Executive Secretary’s proposal to undertake a review of the 
2002 Strategic Plan and report the results of that review to CCAMLR XXX was 
welcomed by the Commission. The Commission noted that the review would offer 
opportunistic consultation with a range of CCAMLR stakeholders regarding 
Secretariat functions and the delivery of services and would address succession 
planning and an overall salary strategy for the Secretariat. The adoption of a ‘green’ 
policy by the Secretariat was welcomed by the Commission.  
 
Other issues   
Other issues discussed at CCAMLR XXIX included new and exploratory fisheries; 
data poor fisheries; krill fishery management; climate change; the development of 
standards for an accreditation scheme for participation in the CCAMLR Scheme of 
International Scientific Observation; the development of compliance and evaluation 
procedure (DoCEP); and, a review of CCAMLR’s Financial Regulations including 
the need for the development of Investment Principles.  
 
INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF ATLANTIC 
TUNAS 
17th extraordinary meeting of ICCAT 
 
27th November, 2010 
PARIS, FRANCE – The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas held its 17th 
Special Meeting from the 17th to the 27th of November 2010 in Paris, hosted by the French Government. 
The meeting focused on the management of tuna and tuna like species under the mandate of the 
Commission and compliance with management regulations by the 48 Contracting Parties (CPCs) 
[members] of ICCAT. The Commission reviewed the status of tuna stocks and by caught species, such as 
sharks and turtles in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea based on the findings of the Standing 
Committee for Research and Statistics Scientific (SCRS) which met in Madrid in October 2010. 
 
At the end of the meeting the CPCs members of ICCAT adopted new management measures for bigeye 
and bluefin tunas and North Atlantic swordfish and for the conservation of sharks and sea turtles that are 
taken as by catch. New improved measures for monitoring, surveillance and control were also adopted. 
ICCAT is also taking a leading role internationally in collecting data on by caught species and in 
conducting research essential to ensure the long-term sustainability of all species caught in tuna fisheries.  
 
Strengthening Compliance with Management Regulations 
An improved approach to ensure compliance by CPCs with ICCAT management regulations was taken 
this year. The work of the Compliance Committee involved a thorough review of compliance CPC by CPC 
to identify failure to comply with ICCAT management measures such as a failure to report catch data or 
overharvesting of ICCAT stocks. A first warning is given by sending a “Letter of Concern” and then a 
stronger warning in the form of a “Letter of Identification”, after which sanctions may be applied. ”The 
Commission agreed to send out twenty three “Letters of Concern” and twenty three “Letters of 
Identification” to CPCs and two CPCs were commended. These require CPCs to report on actions to be 
taken in the coming year to rectify deficiencies and to submit management plans to ensure there is no 
continued overharvest, or else penalties may be applied. Various types of sanctions to be applied in the 
future were considered, e.g. reduction and withdrawal of fishing allocations, financial penalties, or 
suspension of voting privileges. An intersessional meeting of the Compliance Committee will be held early 
in 2011. 
 
 
Bluefin  
A significant portion of the work of the meeting dealt with Atlantic bluefin tuna which has received 
substantial media attention due to overfishing in recent years, especially in the Mediterranean Sea. In 2006 
ICCAT implemented a rebuilding plan to halt over fishing and recover the eastern Atlantic and 
Mediterranean stock by 2022. In the 2010 fishing season, even stronger measures were agreed to accelerate 
rebuilding of the stock to levels that can produce maximum catches at sustainable levels. These included 
-  Reductions in fishing capacity. 
-  A limit on the number of joint fishing operations that could be carried out. 
-  An observer program with 100% coverage of purse seine and farming activities. 
- Reporting of catches close to real-time, allowing for a closer monitoring of the quota 
consumption. 
 
The enhanced monitoring, surveillance, and control measures put in place have resulted in an improvement 
in the data reported by CPCs in the past few years. The assessment this year by the SCRS showed that the 
recent regulations had clearly resulted in reductions in catch and fishing mortality rates. Despite these 
efforts the Commission recognised that conservation and management measures for Eastern bluefin tuna 
must be reinforced to avoid systemic weakness, in particular related to the farming operations for bluefin 
                                      
 
                         Attachment 18-3
tuna. Measures were taken to ensure more accurate data on the numbers and biomass of bluefin tuna 
caught and transferred to tuna farms. These included observer coverage being extended to monitor all 
active towing vessels and purse seiners and the development of stereoscopically video systems to quantify 
fish captures and transfers. 
 
The Commission also adopted a plan to create an electronic system for the entry of the Bluefin tuna Catch 
Documentation program, aimed at improving the system to ensure traceability. It is expected that this 
system will become fully operative for the fishing season in 2012. Given all these improved monitoring, 
surveillance and control measures, and the results of the 2010 SCRS assessment the TAC for 2011 was set 
at 12.900 t for Eastern Bluefin tuna, which has a high chance ( ≥ 95 %) that the condition of the stock will 
improve in the coming years and of about 67% that it will be fully recovered by 2022.   For the Western 
bluefin tuna the Commission continued with their recovery plan, including protect measures such closure 
for direct fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico during spawning, minimum size and catch quotas.  CPCs reported 
that an enhance research program was also started in 2010, in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, 
that will monitor closely the potential effects on the recovery of this stock.   For the Western Bluefin tuna 
stock, the TAC for 2011 was set at 1.750 t. 
 
 
Bluefin  Research to ensure long term Sustainability 
There are major gaps in our knowledge of bluefin tuna biology, for example needed to protect spawning 
populations in the Mediterranean. Therefore ICCAT has established a multi-million Euro Atlantic-wide 
Research Programme for Bluefin Tuna (GBYP) in support of bluefin management. This program is funded 
by CPCs and supported by the fishing industry and environmental NGOs. Work this year included the start 
of aerial surveys of spawning bluefin areas which is being evaluated by the SCRS to see if it can provide a  
fishery independent assessment of stock size to monitor the recovery plan.  
 
ICCAT takes the lead in conservation of Sharks and Sea turtles 
Although ICCATs main responsibility is the management of tunas, The Commission is increasingly taking 
a leading role in the conservation of species caught incidentally in the tuna fisheries; setting an example to 
other Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs). As well as collecting data and 
undertaking assessments on sharks, ICCAT is also conducting research on shark species in the 
Atlantic and Mediterranean in order to establish measures such as time and area closures to protect 
nursery areas. This year several proposals to protect endangered shark species were considered and 
important new conservation measures were adopted by consensus for the conservation of whitetip, shortfin 
mako and hammerhead sharks. These measures forbid the retention and trade of white tip and hammerhead 
shark species (except for the Sphyrna tiburo and for the developing coastal CPCs local consumption) in 
order to increase their survival. While for sea turtles strict measures to minimise catch rates and to 
maximise the chance of survival of released individual were agreed.  
 
North Atlantic swordfish  
The North Atlantic stock was successfully rebuilt in 2009 to above the target set by the Commission's 
management plan (i.e. the biomass that could sustain maximum catches, BMSY). The rebuilding plan 
began in 2000 and included minimum size restrictions as well as quotas. At this annual meeting, a 
total allowable catch (TAC) of 13,700 t was set for 2011. In 2011 a multi-year conservation and 
management plan will be agreed with the objective of achieving BMSY with greater than 50% 
probability. This will be based on Limit Reference Points, consistent with the Precautionary 
Approach, where future decisions shall include the triggering of a rebuilding plan should the biomass 
decrease to a level approaching a limit reference point. 
 
Bigeye  
This year a new assessment was conducted by the SCRS and the Commission set a total allowable 
catch of 85,000 t, in agreement with the scientific recommendations. However, in the past the bigeye 
TAC has been exceeded; and other problems exist including high fishing mortality on juveniles, and 
the move of fishing vessels to the Atlantic Ocean from the Indian Ocean due to piracy. In order to 
address these problems measures such as capacity reduction, time area closures and observer 
programmes were discussed at the Commission and work is on going to implement these measures 
next year.  
 
Miscellanea 
- The meeting was attended by over 500 delegates from 35 Contracting Parties – Algeria, Belize, 
Brazil, Canada, China P.R., Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, Egypt, the European Union, France (on behalf of 
Saint-Pierre and Miquelon), Ghana, Guatemala, Equatorial Guinea, Iceland, Japan, Republic of 
Korea, Libya, Morocco, Mauritania, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Panama, Philippines, the Russian 
Federation, Senegal, South Africa, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad & Tobago, Tunisia,

Uruguay, and Vanuatu. In addition, 5 non-Contracting Parties were present, as well as 4 inter-
governmental organizations and 23 nongovernmental organizations. 
 
- Considering the observer program requirements that may be in place or adopted by ICCAT in the future 
the Commission adopted a set of minimum standard for fishing vessels observer programs including a 
minimum of 5% observer coverage of fishing effort, representative temporal and spatial coverage and 
improve data collection on by catch species. CPCs are also required to report on their domestic observer 
programs to the Commission. 
 
- In 2009 ICCAT established a Working Group on Recreational and Sport Fisheries that harvest 
ICCAT species.  This group is actively working on the development of improved and standardised 
methods to better monitoring of these fisheries.   
 
- In 2010, ICCAT spent nearly 117,000 € in capacity-building activities. These funds, from EU, Japan 
and USA, have been used for facilitating participation in scientific meetings, training workshops, 
sampling and observer programs, and to recover historical logbook data. 
 
The next annual meeting of ICCAT will be held in Spain in November 2011. Other inter-sessional 
meetings will be held throughout the year; detailed venue information can be found as it becomes

Report from the CCSBT Observer (Chinese Taipei) 
to the 82nd Annual Meeting of the 
Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission 
 
The 82nd annual meeting of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) 
was held in La Jolla, California, USA from 4 to 8 July, 2011. 
 
The Meeting was attended by representatives of all 21 Members of the Commission: 
Belize, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, European Union, 
France, Guatemala, Japan, Kiribati, Korea, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, 
Chinese Taipei, United States, Vanuatu, and Venezuela. Cook Islands attended as a 
cooperating non-member. Indonesia attended as an observer. Several international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations were also represented. 
 
Cooperation between IATTC and CCSBT 
No matter related to cooperation between IATTC and CCSBT was discussed in the 
meeting.  
 
Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing 
The Commission decided to include in the IUU list the Bolivian-flagged vessel Mar 
Cantábrico, and to withdraw from the list the vessel Caribbean Star 31 (Colombia), 
Permata (Indonesia), Permata 102 (Indonesia), Permata 138 (Indonesia), and Mutiara 
28 (Indonesia). The updated IUU list has been posted on the website of IATTC.  
 
Adopted Resolutions 
The Commission adopted the three Recommendations adopted in 2010, regarding to 
the tuna conservation, seabird conservation and data buoys, as Resolutions with minor 
modifications. 
 
The Commission also adopted proposals to modify three existing Resolutions, 
regarding to the list of longliners greater than 24 meters in length, the Regional Vessel 
Register and the transshipment at sea by longliners. These changes are primarily to be 
commensurate with the Antigua Convention or to clarify the duties of flag states. 
 
The Commission also adopted Resolution on compliance, which establishes a process 
to improve compliance with the resolutions adopted by the Commission by filling out 
a questionnaire on compliance with each of the resolutions of the IATTC. The 
questionnaire will be reviewed by the Compliance Committee. 
 
The Commission also adopted Resolution on conservation of oceanic whitetip sharks, 
which prohibit retaining onboard, transshipping, landing, storing, selling, or offering 
for sale any part or whole carcass of this species. 
 
The Commission also adopted Resolution on technical assistance to developing 
countries, which establishes a fund for the development of technical and scientific 
capacity of developing countries that are Members of the IATTC, with an initial 
contribution of US$50,000 from the Commission’s annual budget. 
 
The Commission also adopted Resolution on observers on longline vessels, which 
require a minimum observer coverage rate of 5% for longline fishing vessels greater 
than 20 metres length overall, from the beginning of 2013. 
 
The Commission also adopted other Resolutions on the adjustment of the limit on the 
total carrying capacity of purse-seine and pole-and-line vessels registered in Peru, as 
well as the budget for fiscal year 2012. 
 
Other Issues Discussed 
several other important issues were also discussed, such as the conservation of the 
Pacific bluefin tuna, regional register of longline vessels, management of FADs, port 
States measures, conservation of hammerhead shark, trade measures and catch 
documentation scheme, etc. However, no consensus was reached on these issues due 
to lack of time.

Non-Member) of the Extended Commission providing the data to the CCSBT 
authorises its release. 
 
3. Persons duly authorised by the Executive Secretary within the CCSBT Secretariat1 
and service providers, who have read and signed the Commission’s confidentiality 
protocol, shall have access to the data necessary to perform their CCSBT duties.  
 
4. Officers of the Commission2 and its subsidiary bodies, who have read and signed 
the Commission’s confidentiality protocol, shall have access to the data necessary 
to perform their CCSBT duties.  
 
5. Members and Cooperating Non-Members (CNM) of the Extended Commission 
shall have access to data to serve the purposes of the Convention, including data:  
 
(a) covering vessels flying their flag that were authorised or engaged in fishing 
for, retaining on board, transhipping or landing southern bluefin tuna.  
 
(b) covering any vessels fishing in waters under their jurisdiction for the time 
period during which such fishing occurred.  
 
(c) for the purpose of scientific and other research, if the Member or CNM of the 
Extended Commission that originally provided that data authorises the 
Extended Commission to release them or if the data have a “No risk” or 
“Low” confidentiality risk classification according to Table 13.  In cases where 
a Member or CNM of the Extended Commission elects to provide an ongoing 
authorisation for the release of such data, the Member or CNM may at any 
time cancel this authorisation by notifying the Secretariat that it has revised its 
earlier decision.  
 
6. To the greatest extent practical, the CCSBT, its Secretariat and their service 
providers or contractors acting on their behalf, should release data in a timely 
manner. 
                                                 
1 Persons duly authorised by the Executive Secretary within the CCSBT Secretariat are Secretariat staff and 
contractors that are appointed by the Executive Secretary that are responsible to the Executive Secretary.

Advisory Panel) to perform a specific function for the Commission and are responsible to the Commission for this 
function. 
3 These data are typically made available to Members through the private area of the CCSBT web site or the 
CCSBT Data CD. 
 
 
2. Risk classification and definition of confidentiality  
 
7. Data covered by these Rules and Procedures will be classified in accordance with 
the risk classification methodology included in Table 1, which reflects inter alia 
the damage that would be done to the operations or credibility of the Extended 
Commission as a consequence of the unauthorised disclosure of such information.  
 
8. Data covered by these Rules and Procedures are determined to be either public 
domain or non-public domain data in accordance with the confidentiality risk 
classification established in Table 1.  
 
 
3. Dissemination of Public Domain Data  
 
9. Except for data as described in Paragraph 10, the types of data listed in Table 1 
with a “No risk” classification have been designated to be Public Domain data.  
 
10. Data in the public domain shall not reveal the individual activities or identity of 
any vessel, entity or person. Catch and Effort data in the public domain shall be 
aggregated by flag, gear, year, month and 1ºx1º grid (for surface fisheries) or 
5ºx5º grid (for longline fisheries) and, provided that the data contains information 
on the number of vessels in a strata, shall be made up of observations from a 
minimum of three vessels. 
 
11. Public Domain data shall be available to any persons for (a) downloading from the 
Commission’s website and/or (b) release by the Commission on request.  
 
12. The Commission’s website should contain a statement describing the conditions 
associated with the viewing or downloading of Public Domain data (for example, 
that the source of the data must be acknowledged), and should require the person 
requesting the data to “Accept” these conditions before viewing or downloading 
can begin.  
 
 
4. Dissemination of Non-Public Domain Data  
 
 
4.1 Definition of Non-Public Domain Data  
 
13. Subject to the decisions of the Extended Commission, all types of data not 
described in paragraph 9 shall be referred to as Non-Public Domain data.  
 
 
4.2 General rules for dissemination of, and access to, Non-Public Domain data  
 
14. All access to and dissemination of Non-Public Domain data shall only be 
authorised in accordance with these Rules and Procedures and shall be protected 
in accordance with the CCSBT Data Security Standards specified in Attachment 
1.  
 
15. The CCSBT Secretariat shall log and report to the Extended Commission all 
access and release of Non-Public Domain data with a “Medium” or High” risk 
classification including where applicable, the name and affiliation of the person, 
the type of data accessed or released, the purpose for which the data were 
requested, the date when the data were requested, the date when the data were 
released and authorisations that were provided. 
 
 
4.3 Access to Non-Public Domain data by the Staff of the Secretariat, the 
CCSBT Service Providers, and Officers of the Commission and its 
Subsidiary Bodies  
 
16. Pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4, persons duly authorised by the Executive 
Secretary, within the CCSBT Secretariat and service providers, including the 
scientific advisory panel, shall have access to the data necessary to perform their 
CCSBT duties. Officers of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies shall have 
access to the data necessary to perform their CCSBT duties. All such persons shall 
sign a Confidentiality Agreement with the Executive Secretary and maintain the 
CCSBT Data Security Standards in respect of data to which they have access. The 
Executive Secretary shall maintain a Register of all such persons (including the 
purpose for which they require access to the data) and make the Register available 
to a Member or CNM of the Extended Commission on written request.  
 
 
4.4 Access to Non-Public Domain data by Members and CNMs of the Extended 
Commission 
 
17. Members and CNMs of the Extended Commission shall have access to Non-
Public Domain data to serve the purposes of the Convention, including data:  
(a) Covering vessels flying their flag that were authorised or engaged in fishing 
for, retaining on board, transhipping or landing southern bluefin tuna.  
(b) Covering any vessels fishing in waters under their jurisdiction for the time 
period during which such fishing occurred.  
 (c) For the purpose of scientific and other research, if the Member or CNM of the 
Extended Commission that originally provided that data authorises the 
Extended Commission to release them or if the data have a “Low” 
confidentiality risk classification according to Table 13.  In cases where a 
Member or CNM of the Extended Commission elects to provide an ongoing 
authorisation for the release of such data, the Member or CNM may at any 
time cancel this authorisation by notifying the Secretariat that it has revised its 
earlier decision. 
 
18. Members and CNMs of the Extended Commission shall notify the Secretariat of a 
small number of representatives (preferably only 2) authorised to submit requests4 
for access to Non-Public Domain data. Such notification will include name, 
affiliation, and contact information (e.g. telephone, facsimile, email address). The 
                                                 
4 The requests by the authorised representatives would usually be to grant access to data for other people (e.g. 
scientists), not for themselves.  For data classified with a “low risk”, the only requests that need to be made are 
requests for access to relevant parts of the private area of the CCSBT web site.  These requests can be handled by 
simple e-mail correspondence directly with the Secretariat.  For data with a “medium” or “high” risk, the 
procedures in Attachment 2 must be followed. 
CCSBT Secretariat will maintain a list of such authorised representatives. 
Members and CNMs of the Extended Commission and the Secretariat shall ensure 
the list of Member and CNM representatives is kept up to date and made 
available.  
 
19. The authorised representative(s) of the Members and CNMs of the Extended 
Commission are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality and security of the 
Non-Public Domain data according to its risk classification and in a manner 
consistent with the CCSBT Data Security Standards.  
 
20. Access to Non-Public Domain data by Members and CNMs of the Extended 
Commission shall be administered and authorised by the Executive Secretary on 
the basis of these Rules and Procedures in conjunction with the Procedures for 
Requesting the Release of Non-Public Domain data at Attachment 2. 
 
21. A Member or CNM that has not fulfilled its obligations to provide data to the 
Extended Commission for two consecutive years shall not be granted access to 
Non-Public Domain data until all such obligations are met. A Member or CNM 
whose representative, authorised in accordance with paragraphs 18 and 19 above, 
failed to observe the rules stipulated in these Rules and Procedures shall not be 
granted access to Non-Public Domain data until appropriate actions have been 
taken.  
 
 
4.5 Exchange of data with other regional fisheries management organisations  
 
22. If the Commission enters into agreements for the exchange of data with other 
regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) or other organisations, 
such agreements must include requirements that the other RFMO provides 
equivalent data on a reciprocal basis and maintains the data provided to them in a 
manner consistent with the CCSBT Data Security Standards. The data that may be 
exchanged are data with a risk classification of “no risk” or “low risk”.  Data with 
higher risk classifications may only be considered for sharing after specific 
approval from the Extended Commission. At each annual session the Executive 
Secretary will provide copies of data exchange agreements that exist with other 
RFMOs and a summary of the data exchanges that occurred during the previous 
12 months under such agreements. 
 
 
4.5 Disseminations of Non-Public Domain data in other circumstances  
 
23. Non-Public Domain data will be made available by the Secretariat to any persons5 
if the Member or CNM of the Extended Commission that originally provided that 
data authorises the Extended Commission to release them. In cases where a 
Member or CNM of the Extended Commission elects to provide an ongoing 
authorisation for the release of such data, the Member or CNM may at any time 
cancel this authorisation by notifying the Secretariat that it has revised its earlier 
decision. 
 
                                                 
5 Including universities, researchers, NGOs, media, consultants, industry, federations, etc. 
24. Conditions for access to Non-Public Domain data by each non-Member shall be 
determined on a case by case basis by the Member or CNM of the Extended 
Commission that originally provided the data.  At the discretion of that Member or 
CNM, these conditions may or may not involve procedures similar to those 
specified at Attachment 2. 
  
 
4.6 Force majeure  
 
25. The Executive Secretary may authorise the release of Non-Public Domain data to 
rescue agencies in cases of force majeure in which the safety of life at sea is at 
risk. 
 
 
5. Periodic Review  
 
26. The Extended Commission or its subsidiary bodies will periodically review these 
Rules and Procedures, and subsidiary documents, and amend these if necessary.  
 
27. When considering the provision of data not specified in Table 1, the Extended 
Commission or its subsidiary bodies should consider an appropriate risk 
classification for that data for inclusion in Table 1. 
 
 
6. Final Clause  
28. These Rules and Procedures do not prevent a Member or CNM from authorising 
the release of any data it has provided to the CCSBT. 
Table 1: Types of information and confidentiality risk classification.   
Information types that have not received a risk classification within this table will not be 
managed within these confidentiality rules.  However, this table may be updated by the 
Extended Commission from time to time, including through intercessional agreement between 
Members of the Extended Commission, as required. 
 
With the exception of approved summaries of certain information types below, the following 
broad dissemination principles apply to the four confidentiality risk classifications6: 
• 
“No risk”:  Publicly available and may be place on the public area of the CCSBT web 
site. 
• 
“Low Risk”:  Not publicly available.  However, it is available to all Members and 
CNMs without specific approval and may be placed on the private area of the CCSBT 
web site and on the CCSBT Data CD. 
• 
“Medium Risk”:  Not publicly available.  Requires specific authorisation to be 
released.  May not be placed on the CCSBT Data CD or on the private area of the 
CCSBT web site (unless in a special part of the private area that is further restricted to 
specifically authorised people). 
• 
“High Risk”:  Not publicly available.  Requires specific authorisation to be released.  
May not be placed on the CCSBT Data CD or on the private area of the CCSBT web 
site.

classification as specified in the CCSBT Data Confidentiality Security Policy. 
7 This information does not currently exist, but will become available once the CDS has been in operation for 12 
months. 
8 Catch at size and age data are considered to public after the annual Commission meeting each year.  Other 
biological data are only considered public if adequate time has passed to allow the scientists that organised the 
collection of such data to publish a paper analysing it.

Vessel and gear attributes 
from other open sources  
Includes data collected by observers and port inspectors. Covers all 
vessels (i.e. includes vessels restricted to national jurisdiction–domestic 
fleets). Includes electronic equipment.  
Oceanographic and 
meteorological data  
“Oceanographic and meteorological data” in this context does not 
include information identifying the fishing vessel that collected the 
information, for example, which would otherwise alter its security 
classification.

CCSBT Data Confidentiality Security Policy (DCSP) 
 
The purpose of this policy is to help ensure that non-public data (within this 
attachment only, non-public data is referred to as “Data”) is provided to and managed 
by Data receivers in a manner that maintains confidentiality.  This policy is not 
intended to cover aspects of data security that are not related to protection of 
confidentiality, such as loss or damage to data (e.g. through fire, flood, accident, 
systems malfunction etc.). 
 
Data receivers (including the CCSBT Secretariat) are required to manage the security 
of Data to at least the standards specified below.  The standards below are 
intentionally brief in order to provide a clear overview of the scope of the 
requirements.  Further information can be obtained on most items from ISO/IEC 
27002:2005(e)14. 
 
The Executive Secretary may impose additional security requirements before 
releasing specific Data.  The receiver of the Data will be required to observe any such 
additional security requirements.  The Executive Secretary may also waive specific 
security requirements if requested to do so by the provider of the Data. 
 
1) Human Resources Security 
• For data with a risk classification of “medium” or “high”, only people 
approved by the Executive Secretary (herein referred to as “Approved 
People”) shall be allowed access to the Data by the receiving organisation 
(herein referred to as “The Organisation”).  For data with a “low” risk 
classification, people approved by the receiving Member or CNM shall be 
allowed to access the data (also referred to herein as “Approved People”).; 
• The Organisation shall have appropriate terms and conditions in its 
contract/arrangement with Approved People to state their responsibilities for 
information security and to enable disciplinary action for Approved People 
who commit a security breach. 
• Approved People shall be provided, as appropriate, with information security 
awareness education and training by The Organisation. 
• The Organisation shall have termination procedures in place for maintaining 
confidentiality from Approved People whose role or employment changes.  
This will include as a minimum, the return or secure disposal15 of the Data, 
cancellation of access to the Data by such approved people, and for Approved 
People with approval for  access to “medium” and High” risk  data, 
                                                 
14 International Standard on “Information technology – Security techniques – Code of practise for information 
security management”. 
15 For data with a “medium” or “high” risk classification, “Secure Disposal” means that media containing the data 
should be disposed of through incineration or shredding of paper records and by physically destroying electronic 
media or deleting the information by overwriting the Data using techniques that make the original information 
non-retrievable rather than using standard delete or format functions.  Secure Disposal of “medium” and “high” 
risk data requires all copies of the Data, including any backups, to be destroyed.  For Data with a “low” risk 
classification, the disposal procedures required for higher risk Data can be adjusted to a more practical process 
providing that such processes maintain confidentiality.  For example, instead of destroying backups containing low 
risk Data, it would be sufficient to keep those backups in a secure environment with procedures in place that 
prevented unauthorised access to the Data on those backups. 
notification to the Executive Secretary of the person’s changed status together 
with the action taken. 
 
2) Physical and Environmental Security 
• Any unencrypted Data and products of that Data shall be stored in a physically 
secure area which will at minimum consist of: 
o  a robust security perimeter16 and properly functioning entry controls (such 
as automatic locks with card controlled entry or manned reception desk) 
that prevent entry of unaccompanied non-approved people into the secure 
area; and 
o A properly functioning and monitored electronic intruder detection system 
that will detect an intrusion into the secure area. 
• Data with a low to medium confidentiality classification and products of that 
Data that are encrypted as described in paragraph “5”, may be used in a non-
public area outside the secure area described above.  When not in use, the 
media containing these encrypted Data shall be carried in person, or stored in a 
locked private facility and secured or hidden out of sight. 
• Equipment used for displaying the Data (such as monitors and printers) shall 
be located and positioned in such a manner as to prevent unauthorised 
viewing, recording or copying of the displayed information.  Printouts of the 
Data or products of the Data shall be removed from printers immediately. 
• The Data shall be Securely Disposed15 of: 
o 
for “medium” and “high” risk data, when the purpose for which the data 
were requested has been completed; 
o 
for all data, when the data are no longer required by the Organisation to 
serve the purposes of the Convention; 
o 
from any media that are scheduled for maintenance by non-Approved 
People and from any media prior to its disposal. 
 
3) Communication and Operations Management 
• Precautions shall be in place to detect and prevent the introduction of 
malicious code (such as computer viruses, Trojan horses and logic bombs) and 
unauthorised mobile code.  These precautions will at least include: 
o Installation and regular (daily or less) update of malicious code detection 
and repair software to scan computers, media and e-mails for malicious 
code; and 
o The Organisation shall conduct education awareness campaigns, as 
appropriate, on the dangers of malicious code and how to reduce the risk 
of infection by malicious code. 
• Appropriate network controls shall be implemented to maintain security for 
any Data that is accessible through the network. 
• Cabling carrying the Data shall be protected from interception. 
• The Data shall not be transmitted on public networks (such as the internet) 
unless the Data has been appropriately encrypted. 
• Unencrypted Data shall not be transmitted on wireless networks unless the 
network is a private encrypted network and the Data has a low confidentiality 
classification.  A computer that is connected to a wireless network may not 
                                                 
16 A ground floor office with windows would require additional protection for the windows, or physically secure 
internal enclosures for the security perimeter to be acceptable. 
contain Data with a medium or high confidentiality classification unless the 
Data are encrypted and the encrypted volume is not mounted (not active) 
while the computer is connected to the wireless network. 
• Any actual or suspected security incidents shall be investigated and reported to 
the Executive Secretary. 
 
4) Access Control 
• Access to the Data shall require successful logon by an Approved Person, 
involving a User ID and Password17.   
• The User ID shall be unique to the specific Approved Person. 
• The Password must be kept confidential to the Approved Person only and 
should be subject to a suitable password management policy, including: 
o Provision of any temporary passwords in a secure manner and forcing 
passwords to be changed on first log on; 
o Forcing use of minimal length and complexity of passwords; 
o Prevent re-use of passwords;  
o Advising users to use quality passwords (easy to remember without 
writing down, not based on information that is easy to guess, not 
vulnerable to dictionary attacks, free of consecutive identical or sequential 
characters, contain both letters and numbers and have an acceptable 
minimum length) and changing passwords whenever there is an indication 
of possible password or system compromise, and at regular intervals; 
o Storing, transmitting and displaying passwords in protected (e.g. 
encrypted) form; and 
o Limiting the number of unsuccessful log-on attempts to only 3 and 
rejecting further attempts without specific authorisation. 
• Accounts of Approved People shall be protected when unattended by use of a 
password protected screen saver18 that activates after less than 10 minutes of 
inactivity. 
 
5) Cryptographic Control 
• The Data shall be encrypted using robust encryption techniques whenever it is 
not in a physically secure area as described in paragraph “2” above. 
• Provision or transmission of Data by the Secretariat to data receivers or to the 
private area of the CCSBT web site19 shall use encryption techniques 
(encrypted files or encrypted transmission protocols). 
• Encryption may use either secret key techniques or public key techniques 
where each user has a public and a private key.  For both types of techniques, 
a wide variety of suitable file encryption software is available for purchase 
(such as PGP) or for free (such as TrueCrypt). 
• Encrypted volumes shall be automatically dismounted when there has been no 
activity (reading/writing to the encrypted volume) for 60 minutes, after 
entering a power saving mode, and when the user logs off. 
                                                 
17 Other technologies for identification and authentication such as biometrics (e.g. finger-print verification) may be 
used. 
18 Or equivalent measure. 
19 Unless otherwise agreed by the provider of the Data, only Data with a medium confidentiality classification or 
less may be placed on the private area of the CCSBT web site.  However, Data with a medium confidentiality 
classification must be placed in a further restricted part of the private area that can only be accessed by people 
specifically authorised to access that Data. 
• Secret and private keys shall be protected from unauthorised disclosure and 
shall be distributed to intended users in a secure manner.
