9 - 12 October 2017 
Yogyakarta, Indonesia 
 
Agenda Item 1. 
Opening of meeting 
1.1.  Confirmation of Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended Commission of 
the Twenty-Fourth Meeting of the Commission 
1. 
Professor Indra Jaya (Indonesia) was confirmed as the Chair of the Extended 
Commission of the Twenty-Fourth meeting of the Commission for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT 24), and Mr Orlando Fachada 
(the European Union) was confirmed as the Vice Chair. 
2. 
The Director of the Directorate of Fish Resources Management in the Directorate 
General of Capture Fisheries of the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (Dr 
Reza Shah Pahlevi) provided introductory remarks and officially opened the 
meeting. 
3. 
The Chair identified the important issues for the meeting to deal with and 
welcomed participants to Yogyakarta. 
4. 
Members introduced their delegations to the meeting and other participants 
introduced themselves.  The list of participants is provided at Attachment 1. 
 
1.2. Adoption of agenda 
5. 
The agenda was adopted and is included at Attachment 2. It was agreed that 
discussion of New Zealand’s proposal to revise the Resolution on Limited Carry-
forward of Unfished Annual Total Allowable Catch would be conducted at the 
end of agenda item 5, and that Australia’s proposal on a Resolution to Mitigate 
the Impact on Seabirds of Fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna would be discussed 
at the end of agenda item 7.  
6. 
The list of documents submitted to the meeting is provided at Attachment 3. 
7. 
The Chair summarised arrangements for the timing of the meeting and for the 
Finance and Administration Committee (FAC). 
 
1.3. Opening statements 
1.3.1. Members 
8. 
Opening statements by Members of the Extended Commission (EC) are provided 
at Attachment 4.  
 
1.3.2. Cooperating Non-Members 
9. 
The Philippines, the only Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) of the EC, did not 
attend the meeting. 
 
 
1.3.3. Observers 
10. Opening Statements by Observers are provided at Attachment 5. 
 
Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
11. The report from the Secretariat was provided to the meeting as paper CCSBT-
EC/1610/04.  The meeting noted the activities of the Secretariat as reported. 
12. Members noted that the report indicated that funding of the tuna RFMO’s 
Consolidated List of Authorised Vessels (CLAV) by the Common Oceans ABNJ 
Tuna Project was expected to cease in around August 2019.  The meeting 
questioned whether the CLAV was sufficiently useful to justify the tuna RFMOs 
spending the expected US$30,000 per year to maintain it. 
13. In response to a question from Japan on whether the CLAV is useful, the 
Secretariat indicated that the process of developing the CLAV was very useful in 
harmonising available vessel information, but since its launching the Secretariat 
has only made minor use of the CLAV.  HSI noted that the CLAV had been 
successful to help RFMOs clean up their authorised vessels lists and also noted 
that it would be useful for Port States that have inspection requirements under the 
Port State Measures Agreement. The United States emphasised that the CLAV is 
a unique tool for which use is expected to increase as awareness of its availability 
increases and noted the CLAV's link to development of the Global Record. 
14. The EC agreed that the Secretariat should contact the Common Oceans ABNJ 
Tuna Project to request information on how the CLAV is being utilised and how 
it could be useful for CCSBT. 
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
15. The Executive Secretary provided a brief presentation of the draft revised budget 
for 2017 (CCSBT-EC/1710/05), and the proposed budget for 2018 and indicative 
budget for 2019-2020 (CCSBT-EC/1710/06 (Rev.1)).   
16. The Executive Secretary noted that the 2018 draft budget and 2019-2020 
indicative budget include funding to implement the Extended Scientific 
Committee’s three-year workplan. Detailed consideration of the two budget 
papers was referred to the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC). 
17. New Zealand suggested that the EC might wish to convene a Strategy and 
Fisheries Management Working Group (SFMWG) meeting during 2018 to 
consider issues such as detailed parameters for the new Management Procedure 
and standards for E-monitoring. The FAC was asked to consider the option for 
holding such a meeting in its deliberations on the budget. 
18. Mr. Dominic Vallières from New Zealand was nominated as Chair of the FAC.   
19. The FAC was convened to consider: 
• The revised budget for 2017; 
 
• The proposed budget for 2018; and  
• The indicative budget for 2019-2020. 
 
3.1. Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
20. The Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC) presented the 
report of the FAC, which is provided at Attachment 6. It includes a revised 
budget for 2017 and a recommended budget for 2018. 
2017 
21. The meeting adopted the revised 2017 budget which is provided at Annex A of 
the FAC’s report. 
2018 
22. The meeting adopted the 2018 budget which is provided at Annex B of the 
FAC’s report.  
2019 to 2020 
23. The Chair of the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) requested that an 
additional table (such as the Annex C in the FAC’s 2016 report) be included 
within this year’s report to summarise the ESC’s approved Workplan for the 
2018 to 2020 period.  It was noted that this would be particularly useful given 
that the ESC is currently transitioning to a new Chair. 
24. The Secretariat advised that it would prepare a table that specifies which aspects 
of the ESC’s workplan had not been funded by the CCSBT.  That table is 
provided Attachment 7. 
25. The EC noted the indicative budgets of 2019-2020. 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries and ERS Interactions 
26. The Chair noted the deliberations of the Compliance Committee (CC) and invited 
Members to ask any additional questions regarding Members’ National Reports 
to those already raised at the Twelfth Meeting of the Compliance Committee (CC 
12). 
27. No additional questions were asked in relation to Members’ National Reports. 
 
4.1. Reports on Members’ projects 
28. No reports were provided in relation to Members’ projects. 
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
29. The Independent Chair of the Compliance Committee (CC), Mr. Frank Meere 
presented the report of CC 12 which is provided at Attachment 8.  
 
30. The CC Chair highlighted the report’s workplan (paragraph 104) and combined 
notes/recommendations to the EC (paragraph 112), and thanked participants for a 
productive meeting. 
31. The EC adopted CC 12’s report and recommendations, noting that some items 
needed to be discussed further, these being: 
• The request that the EC Chair to write to China to request it to participate in 
CCSBT meetings, exercise greater control over its fishing vessels in the High 
Seas, and cooperate with the CCSBT CDS; 
• Clarification as to whether the EC wishes to consider modifying the Carry-
forward Resolution; and 
• The establishment of a working group to develop standards for the use of E-
monitoring. 
32. Some Members expressed concern that Australia may have replaced 100% of its 
human observers with E-monitoring without any decision in CCSBT, and noted 
that in their opinion that E-monitoring should preferably be complementary to 
human observers rather than fully replacing them. 
33. Australia explained that it has two fishing sectors, and that the purse seine sector 
which catches 90% of the SBT still uses human observers. Australia is not 
currently considering removing human observers from the purse seine sector. It is 
the longline sector which has 100% E-monitoring. Given the lack of consensus 
regarding the complementarity of E-monitoring, and the observer coverage of 
10% for each fishery recommended in Scientific Observer Program Standards, 
Japan questioned Australia’s action with respect to this standard. New Zealand 
proposed that perhaps E-monitoring standards could be discussed within a wider 
SFMWG meeting, rather than within a stand-alone E-monitoring Working 
Group.  
Carry-Forward Proposal 
34. The EC Chair invited New Zealand to present its proposal on the Carry-Forward 
Resolution. 
35. New Zealand referred to its paper CCSBT-EC/1710/19 which proposes that the 
current Carry-forward Resolution be amended to allow under-fishing that has 
been carried forward to generate further under-fishing, provided that the total 
under-fishing carried forward to any year is no more than 20% of the Member’s 
national allocation in the previous year.  New Zealand was of the view that if the 
Resolution is amended in this way, it will better support CCSBT’s objective of 
conservation and optimum utilisation of SBT. 
36. One Member noted that the issues around late Carry-Forward notifications 
should be discussed first before the New Zealand proposal could be considered.  
37. The European Union (EU) queried whether it might be possible to have an 
automated carry-forward process for any unused quota. However, it was pointed 
out that even if there was an automated carry-forward process, there should still 
be a deadline for notifications, so that all Members and the Secretariat would be 
aware of the effective allocations for each Member at an earlier stage of the 
season, rather than late in the season.  
 
38. The meeting agreed that a small working group be convened to consider how the 
Carry-forward Resolution might be amended, including issues around 
notifications discussed at the CC (i.e. the best way/timeframe to provide 
notifications in the future, and any consequences of providing a late notification), 
as well as New Zealand’s proposal to remove the current one year limitation on 
any quota carried-forward. 
39. A series of revisions to the Carry-Forward Resolution were drafted and discussed 
within the small working group. 
40. Members agreed that if another instance of late carry-forward notifications 
occurs in future, then the Resolution may need to be revised further to include 
appropriate disincentives.  In addition, in order to ensure that any potential 
corrective action for late notifications is proportionate to both their impact and 
any corrective actions already implemented for other CCSBT obligations, a 
review of the Corrective Actions Policy may also be required. 
41. In respect of the revised draft, some Members expressed concerns about how a 
Member’s potential to carry-forward unfished quota might be affected if a 
Member’s quota was reduced within a quota block for reasons other than a 
reduced global SBT TAC.  These concerns are addressed within the revised draft 
by including a provision to allow the EC to take into account the circumstances 
of a Member’s quota reduction if determining whether a Member might carry-
forward unfished quota. 
42. The revised draft also recognises that once CCSBT adopts a new MP, the Carry-
Forward Resolution should be reviewed and amended as necessary, taking into 
account any advice from the ESC.  
43. Following further discussion and revision, the meeting adopted the revised Carry-
Forward Resolution, which is provided at Attachment 9.     
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
44. The Chair of the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC), Dr John Annala, 
presented the report of the ESC meeting which is summarised in papers CCSBT-
EC/1710/09 and CCSBT-EC/1710/18. The full ESC Report is at Attachment 10.    
45. Members asked the ESC Chair numerous questions on the nature of the advice 
from ESC, including with respect to the reasons for choosing the MP approach 
for unaccounted mortalities (UAM) over the direct approach, the possibility of 
reducing the costs of the Gene Tagging (GT) project, and the possibility of 
reaching the interim rebuilding target before the next management period (2021-
2023),   In response to these questions, the ESC Chair advised that: 
• The MP approach method to account for UAM is more robust scientifically 
than the direct approach; 
• The current MP is very robust to UAM and even with 2000t of UAM the 
interim rebuilding target would be met; 
• Over time, as confidence in the results are developed, it may be possible to 
reduce the sample size of the GT project, which would reduce the costs; and 
 
• The ESC did not specify the probabilities of reaching the interim rebuilding 
target at an earlier time and only noted that it may be reached in the next one 
or two TAC blocks. 
46. The Secretariat and ESC Chair confirmed that the data collected under the GT 
and close-kin projects is available to all Members for CCSBT purposes on 
request and that these analyses methods will be opened in details in the ESC, 
noting that it was complex technical data, and that it is very large in size.  The 
Secretariat also commented that due to intellectual property issues associated 
with the data, permission would need to be obtained before publishing any 
articles or papers outside the CCSBT that use the data.  
47. The meeting discussed the ESC recommendation to defer the implementation of 
the new Management Procedure (MP) by one year, which would mean that there 
would not be the usual one-year lag between the TAC being agreed and it being 
implemented. The lack of the one-year lag could cause significant administration 
difficulties for New Zealand, especially if a reduction in the TAC is required 
without the 1 year lag.  However, the EC agreed that it would be difficult to 
reduce the MP development time, particularly if there is an iterative process 
between the EC and ESC in determining the parameters for the MP.  It was 
agreed to accept the delay and commence discussions in 2018 on the 
management objectives to be incorporated in the new MP. 
48. The EC approved the report of ESC 22 and noted the recommendations of the 
ESC.  
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Report from the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
(ERSWG) 
49. The independent Chair of the ERSWG, Mr Alexander Morison, presented the 
report of the ERSWG 12 which is summarised in papers CCSBT-EC/1710/10 
and CCSBT-EC/1710/23. The full ERSWG 12 Report is at Attachment 11. 
50. ERSWG 12 provided advice to the EC relating to seabirds, sharks and trophic 
interactions, but no specific recommendations. The EC noted the report of 
ERSWG 12. 
51. The ERSWG chair clarified that fishing for SBT remains a high risk concern for 
seabird bycatch, and that current mitigation measures and their implementations 
are not providing the level of protection expected. 
52. The meeting discussed CCAMLR’s mitigation measures which have largely 
eliminated seabird bycatch. It was noted that integrated line weighting was a 
measure introduced by CCAMLR that was not applicable to the SBT longline 
fishery, but other measures that have been in place and effective for about 20 
years were directly applicable (seasonal closures, line weighting, night setting, 
and streamers). 
53. The EC discussed the timing of the next ERSWG meeting. It was agreed not to 
hold the next meeting in 2018 and to tentatively plan to hold the meeting in early 
2019, subject to decision at EC 25. 
 
54. The ERSWG Chair provided a presentation (CCSBT-EC/1710/24) with 
conclusions from the December 2016 Joint Meeting of tuna RFMOs on the 
Implementation of the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management. The EC 
noted the conclusions from the Joint Meeting of tuna RFMOs on the 
Implementation of the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management. 
55. The EC agreed that two representatives of CCSBT attend the next meeting in 
2018, a Member scientist and someone at Commissioner level, both of whom 
would have airfares and subsistence allowances provided by the Common 
Oceans ABNJ Tuna Project.  It was noted that the CCSBT representatives would 
not be able to make commitments on behalf of the CCSBT.  Their role would be 
to participate, provide knowledge of the CCSBT situation and report back to the 
CCSBT.  It was agreed that the Secretariat would seek nominations for the 
CCSBT representatives once more details of the meeting have been provided. 
56. Australia presented paper CCSBT-EC/1710/22 on a draft Resolution to Mitigate 
the Impact on Seabirds of Fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna. Australia reiterated 
its commitment to seabird mitigation measures, which it considered to be 
urgently required, and urged other Members to share that commitment. The 
resolution had been further modified to address the concerns raised previously by 
some Members and allows for amendments to maintain consistency with other 
RFMOs. 
57. Most Members supported the resolution and agreed that it was required.  
58. Japan maintained its opposition to the introduction of adopting such a resolution 
in CCSBT, stating that SBT fishing vessels must comply with mitigation 
measures from other RFMOs and that Japan is fully committed to mitigation of 
seabird bycatches in the framework of other tRFMOs. Japan also advised that its 
interpretation of the Convention is that the Convention does not include the 
management of ecologically related species as part of the objectives of the 
Convention. 
59. The USA advised that it considered this to be a critical issue for the CCSBT to 
deal with and that the impacts of fishing for SBT on seabirds are unacceptable.  
The USA encouraged the Members to continue working on this issue. 
60. Some Members expressed their disappointment at not being able to agree on the 
binding resolution. It was stated that existing obligations are not working and that 
the EC needs to take action. 
61. HSI stated that the SBT fishery had an inescapable interaction with seabirds, and 
problems will persist unless the CCSBT takes responsibility for management of 
the problem. It said that leaving responsibility to other RFMOs that are tropically 
located to manage the issue was inappropriate and unlikely to work, and that 
there was no value in being fully committed to measures that did not work. It 
further stated that areas of high risk for seabirds are known, as well as bird and 
fishing vessel movements, and that albatrosses will become extinct unless action 
is taken. 
62.  Australia revised its resolution during the meeting to account for a comment 
raised by the EU to harmonise this Resolution according to the ICCAT measure 
and prepared an information paper clarifying points raised by Members during 
discussions. The information paper is at Attachment 12. 
 
63. Japan maintained that it was still not ready to agree to the resolution, since it 
believed that the ICCAT, IOTC, and WCPFC forums cover larger areas and it 
preferred to discuss seabird mitigation issues in those RFMOs. In addition Japan 
did not agree that those forums were focused on tropical tunas. Japan further 
noted that those RFMOs also consider issues regarding seabird mitigation 
measures in higher latitudes as is demonstrated by their mitigation resolutions 
which specify more stringent mitigation measures in higher latitudes. 
64. Other Members did not agree with Japan’s legal arguments for not adopting 
binding seabird mitigation measures within the CCSBT. Australia presented its 
reasons in its information paper, while the EU stated that it did not believe that 
the intent was to manage seabirds, but to manage SBT and to regulate SBT 
fisheries by regulating the interactions with ERS. 
65. Some Members expressed again their disappointment that the issue could not be 
resolved within the Extended Commission. The interaction between seabirds and 
SBT fisheries was generally considered a serious and concerning problem that 
needed to be resolved.  
66. New Zealand stated that fisheries governed by the CCSBT were high risk for 
seabirds, and that despite the lack of agreement, New Zealand will continue to 
take strong mitigation measures. New Zealand expects other Members to comply 
with the mitigation requirements of other RFMOs when required and will report 
vessels it finds not complying with WCPFC measures to the WCPFC. New 
Zealand further stated that it was important to ensure that mitigation measures 
were being followed. 
67. HSI expressed serious disappointment at the lack of agreement, and urged 
Members to consider ACAP best practice advice and to independently implement 
that advice immediately. It stated that it sees no good reason why the ACAP 
measures could not be adopted and was willing to arrange assistance for 
Members with this if required. 
68. Indonesia stated that it was in the process of developing its national plan of 
action for seabirds and welcomed the offer from HSI. Indonesia will try to adopt 
the ACAP advice in its management plan. 
69. At the request of the ERSWG chair, the EC agreed that, at its next meeting, it 
would provide additional guidance as to the priority issues to be addressed at 
future ERSWG meetings. 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
8.1. Attributable SBT Catch 
70. The Chair commented that CCSBT 21 agreed on a common definition for the 
Attributable SBT Catch and that Members would act in good faith to implement 
the common definition of attributable catch adopted at CCSBT 21 as soon as 
practicable but not later than the 2018 quota year.  
71. All Members provided a summary of their progress with regard to implementing 
the Attributable SBT catch and counting all sources of mortality against their 
allocations as follows. 
 
72. Australia advised that it had settled a number of actions to meet the attributable 
catch commitment. Its government considers an amount of 250t is appropriate to 
begin to account for recreational catch. The annual decision on allocation for the 
commercial sector is a matter for the regulator (AFMA) who have been advised 
of the government’s position. Australia will also settle agreement with relevant 
states on resource sharing and management, implement a program to educate 
recreational fishers on SBT and fish handling practices, and commence a national 
survey of recreational catch in 2018.  
73. Japan suggested that recreational catches had existed potentially for a long time 
in Australia at least 250t even without total estimates that Australia will conduct 
in the near future and thus urged Australia not to carry forward its unused quota 
in the 2017 fishing season to the 2018 fishing season under such situation, if it is 
less than 250t. Australia replied that commitments to address attributable catch 
were to commence in the 2018 fishing season. The matter of carry forward is a 
separate issue and will be managed according to existing provisions. 
74. Japan questioned about when Australia plans to implement stereo video 
monitoring, and if it could proceed with sampling a certain percentage of fish, for 
example, 20% as adopted by ICCAT. Australia reiterated its commitment to 
implement stereo video monitoring when a fully automated and cost effective 
system is available. 
75. The European Union advised that it is declaring all SBT catches to the CCSBT, 
which in recent years have been 0t with no discards.  
76. Taiwan reported that it has allocated 10t for releases and discards since the 2016 
fishing season. This amount was estimated using discard information from 
scientific observers and fishing effort by SBT vessels. 
77. Indonesia stated that its all attributable catch data is derived from  artisanal 
fisheries (i.e. small scale fisheries with vessel under 30 GT). The data was 
recorded and reported in CDS document. However, it is noted that there is a 
delay in the process to validate the CDS data and Indonesia is taking steps to 
improve the accuracy of its mentioned CDS data by integrating them with 
logbook data, landing data at port and including to place observer in small scale 
fisheries to avoid unrecorded mortality due to discard and artisanal fishing 
activities. New Zealand noted that by relying on CDS data, Indonesia was 
potentially excluding mortalities due to discards and artisanal fishing where SBT 
ends up being consumed domestically. 
78. Japan reported that it has reserved 20t of its allocation for releases and discards 
since its 2016 fishing season, and will review this for the 2018 fishing season in 
respect of its increased allocation. 
79. Korea stated that it has allocated 5t of its total allocation to account for 
discard/release mortality to implement its SBT attributable catch, based on the 
best available scientific information. Since 2015 it has encouraged its fleet not to 
discard or release SBT. 
80. New Zealand advised that it has accounted for all sources of mortality since 2004 
under its quota management system. This is currently 20t for discards and 
predation, and 9t for a combination or recreational and customary catch. New 
Zealand noted that it may have to reconsider the recreational fishing catch 
 
allocation amount due to increased recreational fishing activity for SBT during 
2017. 
81. South Africa reported that in its commercial fishery, discarding is strictly 
prohibited and its recreational fishery is not permitted to fish for SBT. It will set 
aside a portion of its allocation for attributable catch but has not yet finalised the 
amount.  
  
8.2. TAC Determination 
82. At CCSBT 23, the EC agreed to set the global TAC for 2018-2020 at 17,647 
tonnes in accordance with the recommendation from the CCSBT’s Management 
Procedure (MP).  This global TAC includes: 
• 306t set aside for IUU catch by Non-Members; and  
• 6t set aside for research mortality allowance (RMA). 
83. The EC confirmed there were no exceptional circumstances that required the 
2018 TAC to be revised, and the TAC for 2018 was confirmed to remain at 
17,647t. 
84. The TAC for 2019 - 2020 was also confirmed to remain at 17,647t. 
 
8.3. Research Mortality Allowance 
85. The Chair advised the meeting that the ESC had endorsed a total Research 
Mortality Allowance (RMA) of 5.2t to be set aside for 2018 as follows:  
• 3t for the CCSBT gene tagging project;  
• 1.2t for Australia’s projects on health assessment of wild SBT; and  
• 1t for Japan’s trolling surveys of juvenile SBT in Western Australia. 
86. The EC approved these RMA requests. 
 
8.4. Allocation of TAC 
87. In relation to the allocation of TAC for 2018, the meeting confirmed that the 
allocations for 2018 would be as agreed at CCSBT 23.  The agreed allocations 
are provided in Table 1 below. Japan is providing a voluntary transfer of 21t to 
Indonesia and 27t to South Africa for the 2018 to 2020 quota block.  This transfer 
is included in column “(3)” of Table 1.  6,165 will be Japan’s starting point in 
considering the allocation from 2021.

88. The Executive Secretary noted that CCSBT’s Resolution on the Allocation of the 
Global TAC (paper CCSBT-EC/1710/11) is currently out-dated. A set of 
revisions were proposed to reflect decisions already made by CCSBT 23 and 
items that are no longer relevant including taking into account that: 
• A Management Procedure is already in place; 
• All Members have returned to their original nominal catch levels and will 
exceed those levels from 2018; 
• There are no longer any Members on voluntary reductions that need to be 
returned, and 
• South Africa has acceded to the Convention, so the TAC increase being 
conditional on South Africa’s accession is no longer required. 
89. The EU suggested that in future it would be good practice if any associated 
updates to Resolutions could be made within the same meeting as relevant 
decisions/updates are agreed, as is generally the practice in other RFMOs.  It was 
acknowledged that this should be done if possible. 
90. The EC adopted the revised Resolution on Allocation of the TAC.  The revised 
Resolution is provided at Attachment 13. 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
CCSBT Strategic Plan 
9.1. Action for 2017 
Revised risk classifications assigned to each type of CCSBT data to enable sharing 
of appropriate datasets (very high) 
91. The Secretariat presented the relevant part of paper CCSBT-EC/1710/12 (pp 1-2 
and 21-22) in relation to revised risk classifications for data types within the 
CCSBT’s Rules and Procedures for the Protection, Access to, and Dissemination 
of Data compiled by the CCSBT (DCRs).  One data type was proposed for a 
lowered risk classification and five new data types were added.  
92. The Secretariat outlined CCSBT’s confidentiality risk classifications which range 
from “no risk”, meaning publicly available, through to “high risk”, which has the 
strictest confidentiality controls. It was clarified that the Close-Kin and gene 
tagging genotype data had been classified as medium risk due to Intellectual 
Property (IP) requirements.  
93. The meeting agreed the Secretariat’s revised risk classifications and new data 
types.  The revised DCRs are provided at Attachment 14. 
 
 
Review the costs and benefits of changing the current chairing arrangements for 
CCSBT including consideration of longer term appointments to ensure full year 
availability of a Chair for support, decision making and continuity (high) 
94. The Secretariat outlined some of the advantages and disadvantages of CCSBT’s 
current chairing arrangements and presented a proposal for updating these in 
order to improve the governance and efficiency of the CCSBT. 
95. The Secretariat also advised that: 
• CCSBT is the only tuna RFMO (tRFMO) with an annually rotating Chair; 
• Extending the term of the CCSBT Chair to two years plus the possibility of 
one re-election would overcome most of the current disadvantages of the 
current arrangements; 
• Should Members wish to explore the possibility of a multi-year CCSBT Chair, 
the best way to facilitate this might be to follow IATTC’s approach.  This 
would require a change to CCSBT’s Rules of Procedure. 
96. It was noted that if Members support appointing a multi-year Chair, then several 
associated items would need to be considered including funding, the timeframe 
within which to commence the new Chairing process, and the criteria for the 
Chair’s selection and appointment. 
97. The meeting viewed the proposal favourably.  Taiwan advised that it preferred to 
maintain the current rotational practice, but could support a Chair being 
appointed for a 2-year term in order to improve governance. 
98. Various funding options were discussed, and the Executive Secretary advised that 
the average annual costs associated with a Chair, assuming travel from Canberra 
to the capital of each Member, were expected to be approximately $7,000. 
99. The EC agreed to change CCSBT’s Rules of Procedure to allow for election of a 
Chair and Vice-Chair that may be re-elected at each annual meeting for a 
maximum 4 consecutive years in office.  The agreed revision to the Rules of 
Procedure is provided at Attachment 15. 
100. It was further agreed that: 
• The Chair’s government would fund the participation of the Chair at CCSBT 
meetings, but the CCSBT would fund the airfares and subsistence of the Chair 
when the Chair was required to represent the CCSBT at non-CCSBT 
meetings; 
• The first election for the Chair and Vice-Chair under the new arrangements 
would occur at CCSBT 25, with the elected Chair commencing his/her duties 
immediately after CCSBT 25.  Any Member is entitled to nominate a person 
to be the Chair, so more than one person might be nominated for the Chair’s 
position. 
 
Explore funding sources other than Member governments’ assessed contributions 
to support the work of the Extended Commission (high) 
101. The Secretariat presented the relevant part of paper CCSBT-EC/1710/12 (pp 5 - 
7) on potential sources of voluntary financial contributions to CCSBT’s work. 
The paper proposed three types of voluntary contributions that could be made 
 
from sources other than Member governments’ assessed contributions, as well as 
how these contributions might be reflected in the budget. 
102. The Secretariat identified three types of voluntary contributions that could 
potentially be made: 
• Voluntary contributions to projects; 
• Voluntary contributions to meeting costs; and  
• Voluntary contributions to a Special Purpose Fund. 
103. It was clarified that voluntary contributions could be accepted from non-
Members such as other organisations, especially with respect to the Special 
Purpose Fund. 
104. The EC agreed to support the proposed approach to voluntary contributions to the 
CCSBT. 
 
Implement flexible management arrangements – As appropriate, conduct quota 
trading between Members (high) 
105. The Chair introduced the Secretariat’s discussion of options to be considered for 
SBT quota trading that are presented on pages 7 to 11 of paper CCSBT-
EC/1710/12. 
106. The meeting briefly discussed this item and decided that it is not a current 
priority. Any further discussion of this item was deferred to the future. 
107. It was agreed that quota trading may not occur unless prior approval has been 
given by the EC. 
 
Flag states/fishing entities to complete self-assessments of capacity with respect to 
national allocations. Flag State/fishing entity to take corrective action if required 
(medium) 
108. The European Union presented the paper CCSBT-EC/1710/21 on its self-
assessment of fishing capacity. 
109. The meeting thanked the EU and noted the report. 
 
9.2. Action for 2018 
After reaching each Members’ nominal catches, assess the costs and benefits of 
alternative rebuilding strategies, including those that favour stock rebuilding over 
short-term catch increase (very high) 
110. The Secretariat introduced this topic, noting that it was not clear whether the EC 
was interested in an economic cost-benefit analysis or an assessment of the catch 
and resource trade-offs of different rebuilding strategies.  It is the latter case that 
is addressed by the ESC’s three-year work plan. 
111. Members agreed that an economic cost-benefit analysis is not needed, and that 
the intention was to examine different rebuilding strategies. The meeting agreed 
that this item is already adequately covered as part of the MP review. 
 
 
Review the implementation of the Recommendation on ERS (medium/high) 
112. The Chair introduced the Recommendation on ERS aspect of the Secretariat’s 
paper CCSBT-EC/1710/12 (p12).  The paper proposes three options for 
reviewing the implementation of the ERS Recommendation. These are: 
• Requesting that the ERSWG conduct a review at its next meeting which could 
involve sending questionnaires to Members to complete in advance of the 
meeting; 
• Requesting the Secretariat to conduct a desktop review of the implementation, 
which could also involve sending questionnaires to Members to complete; or  
• Developing a Terms and Reference for a special purpose Quality Assurance 
Review on the implementation of the Recommendation on ERS and contract 
an independent provider to conduct the review. 
113. Members did not support the third option due to the associated cost implications. 
114. The meeting agreed to implement the second option and requested that the 
Secretariat compile the results of the questionnaire for presentation to the EC 
through the CC. 
 
Develop a policy and management strategy for ERS, including consideration of 
clear criteria against which effectiveness could be assessed whilst also addressing 
safety and issues of practicability, under close cooperation with other tuna RFMOs, 
relevant industries and other stakeholders, in order to facilitate the fishing 
industry’s efforts to reduce the risks to ERS (medium/high) 
115. The Chair introduced this aspect of the Secretariat’s paper CCSBT-EC/1710/12 
(p13), which provides the following three options for the EC’s consideration: 
• Including a policy/management strategy as one component of a CCSBT 
Fisheries Management Plan and develop this policy in conjunction with the 
Fisheries Management Plan which will be considered at agenda item 10 of this 
meeting; 
• Developing a Terms of Reference for an ERS policy/management strategy and 
then inviting a Member to develop a draft policy and management strategy in 
accordance with the Terms of Reference for discussion at CCSBT 25; or  
• Scheduling a meeting of the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working 
Group (SFMWG) to develop a draft policy and management strategy. 
116. The meeting agreed that Australia would prepare a paper for CCSBT 25, with 
options for how the EC might provide focus and direction to the work of the 
ERSWG. 
 
Promote discussion on research on ecosystem conditions that may affect the 
reproduction of SBT, with a view to improving knowledge of the effect of climate 
change on reproduction and recruitment of SBT (medium/high) 
117. The Chair introduced this aspect of the Secretariat’s paper CCSBT-EC/1710/12 
(p13), which noted that the agenda of the ESC is heavily focused on development 
and implementation of the new Management Procedure up until 2020.  
Consequently, it was suggested that: 
 
• If active work is required in this area, then it may need to either wait until after 
2020 for the ESC to have additional time, or a special working group might 
need to be formed to progress it; or 
• Alternatively, if less proactive work is sufficient, it may be possible to call for 
papers on this topic prior to ESC meetings and to include discussion of any 
papers received within the ESC’s agenda. 
118. The meeting agreed to defer consideration of this topic so as not to delay the high 
priority MP work. 
 
Develop options (based on Convention text) for long term allocation arrangements 
for all Members, including new members, and apply to TAC increases or decreases 
(medium/high) 
119. The Chair introduced this aspect of the Secretariat’s paper CCSBT-EC/1710/12 
(pp 13-14), and asked the meeting whether the update to the CCSBT’s Resolution 
on Allocation of the Global TAC made earlier in the meeting meets the current 
needs of the Extended Commission for this strategic plan item. 
120. Australia considered that the updates already made to the Resolution are 
sufficient for current purposes. This view was supported by Japan.  However, 
New Zealand thought differently and suggested that it would be useful to develop 
a policy that sets out a standard process for considering any new Member 
applications. 
121. The Chair noted that the meeting had not reached agreement on this. matter. 
 
Consider the need to improve transparency of the decision making processes by 
minimising the use of Heads of Delegation meetings (medium) 
122. Members discussed the desirability of reducing the number of Heads of 
Delegation (HoD) meetings held in order to improve transparency.  
123. The EC agreed that the possibility of having HoD meetings needs to be retained, 
but that HoD meetings should be held wisely and not excessively in the future.  It 
was also agreed that small working group meetings open to observers could be a 
useful forum in those cases where progress can be made by a small group. 
 
Review Convention text (if Member/s propose such negotiations) and, where 
appropriate, incorporate modern fisheries management principles and/or standards 
through decisions of the Commission e.g. in reviewing Management Procedure; 
measures to manage ERS (noting the latter option may be more efficient) (medium) 
124. The Chair introduced this aspect of the Secretariat’s paper CCSBT-EC/1710/12 
(pp 14-15), which provided an extract of a brief round table discussion held in 
relation to the Convention at CCSBT 23.  From that discussion, work on 
modernising the Convention did not appear to be of a sufficiently high priority 
for most Members to review the Convention within the timeframe specified by 
the Strategic Plan.   
125. Members discussed the desirability of modernising the Convention including 
issues related to Membership, and some Members expressed concern about 
 
potentially deferring further discussion until the next review of CCSBT’s 
Strategic Plan. 
126. It was agreed that this item should be discussed in next year’s EC agenda item on 
the Strategic Plan. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Consideration of a CCSBT Fisheries Management Plan (FMP) 
127. It was recalled that CCSBT 22 agreed that New Zealand would work 
intersessionally on developing a draft FMP to be considered by the EC in 2017, if 
its resources allowed. 
128. New Zealand commented that it was unable to produce a draft FMP due to 
resource issues, and sought confirmation from other Members that they saw 
value in the development of a FMP before beginning the work. 
129. Other Members did not express support for development of a FMP. 
130. New Zealand withdrew its offer to prepare the draft FMP but will reconsider if 
the EC changes its position on the value of a FMP in the future. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Cooperating Non-Members 
131. The Chair advised the meeting that the CCSBT has been concerned by the 
Philippines’ lack of attendance at meetings for the last two years and for the lack 
of any annual reports from the Philippines last year.  The Philippines wrote to the 
Chair on 7 July 2017, responding to the Extended Commission’s concerns and 
acknowledging that it has not been actively participating in the work of the 
Commission in the past years.  In that letter, the Philippines committed to 
cooperate and participate in the future activities of the Commission such as 
attending meetings and submitting required annual reports. However the 
Philippines did not submit annual reports to either the ESC or CC/EC meetings 
and did not attend these meetings. 
132. The EC agreed that the Philippines did not qualify to retain the status of 
Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) of the CCSBT and that the Philippines CNM 
status would not be renewed.  However, the EC noted that the Philippines could 
submit an application in the future if it wanted to re-apply. 
133. The Secretariat confirmed to Japan that the Philippines lose the status of CNM of 
the CCSBT after EC report be adopted. And Japan stated that it would take 
several months to stop importing SBT from the Philippines since it needs enough 
time to amend the internal system and to inform it to the stakeholders including 
importers. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
134. The Secretariat presented paper CCSBT-EC/1710/14 on CCSBT’s relationship 
with non-Members and advised that the United States, Fiji, Singapore and China 
had been invited to attend the meetings of the Compliance Committee and 
 
Extended Commission.  The Secretariat noted the communication with China 
regarding the draft IUU Vessel List and in seeking China’s cooperation with the 
CCSBT’s CDS.  The Secretariat also noted the continued cooperation by the 
USA with the CCSBT CDS. 
135. The USA commented that it has made efforts to improve its cooperation with the 
CDS. SBT dealers are now required to submit documents through a single 
electronic customs interface and upload CDS Documents in real time when trade 
occurs, which will improve the timeliness of document submission. It has 
completed a comprehensive review of import data of highly migratory species 
and will conduct targeted outreach and enforcement based on that review. These 
efforts should lead to further improvements, and the USA will continue to work 
with the Secretariat. 
136. The EC thanked the USA for its continued cooperation with the CDS and agreed 
that the Secretariat should repeat its invitations to China, Fiji, Singapore, and the 
USA for CC 13 and CCSBT 25. 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Kobe Process 
137. The Secretariat presented paper CCSBT-EC/1710/15 which provided an update 
in relation to Kobe process activities and also proposed providing long term 
observers status for the Chairs of joint tuna RFMO groups to relevant meetings of 
the CCSBT. 
138. The EC agreed to the proposal to provide long term observers status for the 
Chairs of joint tuna RFMO groups to relevant meetings of the CCSBT. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
14.1. Reports from other RFMO meetings of interest  
139. The Chair introduced this item which is summarised in the Secretariat’s paper 
CCSBT-EC/1610/16 on activities with other organisations. 
140. The following reports were provided by Members as part of their observer duties 
for the CCSBT: 
• Australia’s report (CCSBT-EC/1710/25) on the 35th Annual Meeting of the 
Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in 
Hobart, Tasmania from 17 – 28 October 2016;  
• Indonesia’s reported on the 21st Session of the Indian Ocean Tuna 
Commission (IOTC) in Yogyakarta, Indonesia from 22 – 26 May 2017;  
• Japan’s report (CCSBT-EC/1710/26) on the 20th Special Meeting of 
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in 
Portugal from 14 - 21 November 2016; 
• Korea’s report (CCSBT-EC/1710/27) on the on 12th Annual Meeting of 
WCPFC on Denarau Island, Fiji from 5 – 9 December 2016; and 
 
• Taiwan’s report (CCSBT-EC/1710/20) on the Report from the CCSBT 
Observer (Chinese Taipei) on the 2017 Annual Meeting of the Inter-American 
Tropical Tuna Commission in Mexico from 19 – 28 July 2017. 
141. It was agreed that the following Members would act as Observers on behalf of 
CCSBT for 2017/18: 
• Australia to continue as Observer to CCAMLR; 
• Indonesia to continue as Observer to IOTC; 
• Japan to continue as Observer to ICCAT; 
• Korea to continue as Observer to WCPFC; and 
• Taiwan to continue as Observer to IATTC. 
142. The Secretariat presented parts of its paper CCSBT-EC/1710/16 with respect to 
progress on two Memoranda of Cooperation (MoCs) agreed between the CCSBT 
and WCPFC during 2016. The two MoCs discussed were the: 
• MoC on the exchange and release of data; and 
• MoC on the endorsement of the WCPFC Regional Observer Programme 
observers for observing transhipments of SBT on the High Seas of the 
WCPFC Convention Area. 
143. Both MoCs were signed by WCPFC’s Chair in April 2017 and subsequently by 
the CCSBT’s Chair in June 2017. 
144. It is expected that the first exchange of data under the Exchange and Release of 
data MoC will occur during CCSBT’s 2018 Scientific Data Exchange. 
145. With respect to the Transhipment MoC, the Secretariat advised that it is currently 
in the process of developing the systems and processes necessary to 
operationalise it. 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Confidentiality of Data and Documents 
15.1.   Confidentiality of reports and documents from 2017 
146. The Secretariat introduced paper CCSBT-EC/1710/17 (Rev. 2) on the 
confidentiality of reports and documents submitted as meeting documents during 
2017.   
147. The meeting noted that all the reports of meetings and documents submitted to 
meetings under the jurisdiction of CCSBT 24 would be made publicly available 
with the following exceptions: 
• Attachment A of the Secretariat’s paper CCSBT-ESC/1708/04. 
• Japan’s paper CCSBT-ESC/1708/25 and CCSBT-CC/1710/BGD01 which 
provides an update for 2017 on monitoring of southern bluefin tuna trading in 
the Japanese domestic markets 
• Japan’s paper CCSBT-OMMP/1706/10 and CCSBT-ESC/1708/BGD08 which 
provides an update on the estimation of unaccounted catch mortality in 
Australian SBT farming for the 2016 fishing season. 
• Japan’s paper CCSBT-ESC/1708/BGD09 on a review of Southern Bluefin
Tuna trade and monitoring research in Japanese domestic markets (this paper
was previously presented to the 2015 Compliance Committee and classified as
confidential by CCSBT 22).

• The 23rd Extended Scientific Committee meeting, in San Sebastian, Spain

• The 25th Extended Commission Meeting, in Noumea, New Caledonia from
15 – 18 October 2018.
149. The Executive Secretary will determine suitable dates for a five-day 
intersessional OMMP meeting during 2018 after discussion with the scientists 
involved, in accordance with past practise for this meeting. 
150. A four-day meeting of the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group 
(SFMWG) will be held in Canberra, Australia in March 2018. The Secretariat 
will prepare a Draft Provisional Agenda in consultation with the Chair

Commission of the 25th Annual Meeting of the CCSBT 
151. The EU advised that it will nominate the Chair of the Extended Commission of

Other Business 
152. The EC agreed to renew the appointment of the ERSWG Chair, Mr Alexander 
Morison for another term.

develops. Australia offered to communicate with the WCPFC on this matter and 
report back to the CCSBT subsidiary bodies next year. 
 
154. The EU noted that ICCAT and IOTC were undertaking similar initiatives and 
feedback could also be sought from them.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Good morning. 
On behalf of the Australian delegation, I would like to express our appreciation to the 
Chair of the Commission, Dr Professor Indra Jaya, for his participation at this 
meeting. I would also like to thank the government of Indonesia for hosting this 
meeting; we greatly appreciate the warm welcome and the great meeting venue. We 
are pleased to be here and look forward to working with you all again this year.  
I would also like to extend our gratitude to the Secretariat for the work they do 
throughout the year, and in the lead up to these meetings, to prepare the working 
papers and ensure that everything runs smoothly.  
Australia notes the positive news on likely continuing stock recovery coming from the 
recent Extended Scientific Committee meeting last month. It is satisfying that many 
years of hard work by the Commission appear to be paying dividends. Of course, we 
need to remain cautious. Australia’s scientists regularly remind us that strong 
recruitment performance and spawning stock recovery are different and potentially 
unrelated things. 
Next year will mark the 25th meeting of the Commission; a significant milestone. The 
Commission is well past its formative years, and has moved to a more mature and 
fully functioning organisation. Australia sees the work of the Commission over future 
years as building on already solid foundations, and working to consolidate and refine 
our management arrangements.  
Key issues for the future, from Australia’s perspective, will include: ensuring greater 
accounting for attributable catch at a national level, acting to better understand and 
address non-Member catch, forming stronger management bonds with related regional 
fisheries management organisations, responding more credibly to ecologically related 
species issues, and ensuring we continue with a Management Procedure that achieves 
the objectives we articulate. Critical to this will be the right systems and processes to 
deliver scientific and management information of the highest order.  
I would like once again to thank our hosts, the Indonesian government; and to 
reiterate Australia’s commitment to working constructively with all Members, not just 
this week, but over the coming years.  
Thank you.

Opening Statement by European Union 
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
The EU Delegation is very happy to be present at the 24rd Annual Meeting of 
CCSBT. We would like first of all to thank Indonesia for hosting the annual meeting 
in this historical city but also for the very warm welcome that has been extended to us 
and for the facilities provided to the Commission. We would also like to thank the 
Secretariat for the preparatory work.  
Despite being a major fishing player and fish producer, the world’s largest importer of 
fish and fish products, in value, and one of the biggest consumers of fish in the world, 
the EU has limited direct interests in CCSBT either in terms of catches or imports. 
Notwithstanding, we are very keen to contribute to the sound management of the 
Southern Bluefin Tuna stock and to promote good governance and coherence amongst 
Tuna RFMOs, notably by supporting science and/or compliance in CCSBT and 
sharing here our experiences from other sister organisations. 
The European Union looks forward to benefit from the work and recommendations of 
science in general and particularly from the Scientific Committee in support of the 
adoption of conservation measures aiming at the sustainable exploitation of the 
natural resources. In this same context, the EU is also strongly committed to ensuring 
and support compliance in CCSBT.  
This year, we are particularly interested in discussions on the operational model but 
also on the decision of a number of proposals for Resolutions, notably the measure to 
mitigate the impact of SBT fisheries on seabirds, the update MSC measures and other 
compliance issues following Compliance Committee discussions.  
In addition, we believe that by revisiting the Compliance Action Plan the Commission 
will contribute to improving the level of compliance within CCSBT.  
Finally, we have also good expectations on the discussions on attributable SBT catch.  
To conclude, I would like to underline our willingness to work constructively and co-
operatively with all CCSBT Contracting Parties this week, in order to finish on a 
successful and positive note on Tuesday. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen, Good 
morning. 
On behalf of Taiwan delegation, I would like to extend our appreciation to our host 
Indonesia for choosing this beautiful city, Yogyakarta to hold the meeting. This is my 
first time to visit this city. The excursion yesterday was a wonderful arrangement. We 
all enjoyed it very much.  
My thanks also go to Mr. Kennedy, the Executive Secretary and the Secretariat staffs 
for your excellent work in preparing the complete meeting documents and arranging 
this meeting. I would also like to welcome the observers from the United States of 
America, BirdLife international, the Humane Society International (HSI), and 
TRAFFIC. 
Since 2012, we use MP to set the global total allowable catch (TAC) to ensure the 
SBT spawning stock biomass achieves the interim rebuilding target of 20% of the 
spawning biomass by 2035. According to the results of a full stock assessment 
conducted by the Extended Scientific Committee this year, the stock remains at a low 
state, estimated to be 13% of the initial spawning stock biomass, but it has been 
improvement since previous stock assessments. Besides, the current projections 
results indicate that the interim rebuilding target may be reached earlier than 
anticipated (in the next 1 or 2 TAC blocks). It is the due time for us to review the 
stock rebuilding target while developing a new MP next year. 
The impact of SBT fisheries on ecologically related species is always our concerned 
issue, especially for sea-bird mitigation measures. In the present, the related RFMOs 
have adopted the relevant resolution or recommendation to use mitigation measures to 
reduce accidental by-catch of seabirds. We are all bound by our commitment to 
comply with the measures.  
In closing, I look forward to working with all members in the following days to 
achieve constructive outcomes for the sustainability of SBT fishery. 
Thank you. 
Attachment 4 – 4 
 
Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
On behalf of the government of Indonesia, I am very delighted to welcome the 
delegates of the 24th Annual Meeting of The Commission for The Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna, the observers, business owners, and NGOs who have the same 
interest in sustainable management of Southern Bluefin Tuna resource. I would like to 
thank all of delegates who have been attending the meeting since October 5th, 2017. 
Welcome to Yogyakarta, which is one of special region in Indonesia. This province 
has its own uniqueness, rich of culture, and historical place of human civilization.  
Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
As we are all aware, the resources of tuna fisheries are a commodity that has an 
important economic value, which due to the nature of being highly migratory species, 
the utilization extraction is done by many countries.   
Based on the official data released by FAO through the State of World Fisheries and 
Aquaculture (SOFIA) in 2016,  there are approximately 7.7 million metric tonnes of 
tuna and tuna-like species caught all over the world. In the same year, Indonesia 
contributed almost 16% of the total catch. The average production of tuna, skipjack, 
and mackerel tuna in Indonesia for the last 5 years has reached more than 1,1 million 
tonnes/year. Without any doubt, the economic value of tuna is very large and has 
become an important fishery that needs to be utilized in a sustainable fashion, 
moreover for southern Bluefin tuna. 
With regards to the management and conservation of southern Bluefin Tuna, we 
appreciate the actions have been done by all CCSBT members, non-cooperating 
member and all other concerned parties for past several years in preserving the 
southern Bluefin tuna which those may have resulted to the estimation of earlier SBT 
stock recovery in 2020. This gives us a hope amidst to the facts of other global tuna 
stocks status which are currently being utilized in maximum condition (fully fished) 
or even caught in “biological unsustainable levels” as indicated in the FAO reports.  
In this connection, we are glad the compliance committee meeting, which has just 
been conducted last week, has reached with some consensus to improve resolutions in 
line with other international developments of tuna fisheries management and 
conservation measures done by other RFMOs, bringing new aspects of science and 
technology for improving data and monitoring as well as its traceability of the SBT 
products. We do hope this can be a positive signal to show our commitment on 
building Southern Bluefin tuna sustainability. 
Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
As one of the largest tuna producers in the world, Indonesia is looking out to a 
number of emerging challenges, such as the complex problem with the management 
of tuna fishery.   To overcome this challenges, since 2015 Indonesia has been 
implementing "Tuna Fisheries Management Plan", stipulated by the Decree of the 
Minister of Marine and Fisheries of the Republic of Indonesia Number 
107/KEPMEN-KP/2015 concerning Fisheries Management Plan of Tuna, Skipjack 
and Neritic Tuna.  
To improve compliance with tuna management and conservation measures, Ministry 
of Marine Affairs and Fisheries of the Republic of Indonesia continues to strive in 
implementing programs and activities that support Indonesian product traceability 
system are free from IUU Fishing activities. As you may have known, our 
government puts very serious efforts in combating IUU fishing practices. Recently, 
we have established a special task force (Satgas 115) under the Presidential Decree to 
combat IUU Fishing practices, we are also identified as a champion partner to FAO in 
the development of the Global Record of Fishing Vessels and even we have opened 
our VMS data integrated to the Global Fishing Watch. Our serious efforts to eradicate 
IUU Fishing also by pushing the international entity so as illegal fishing and fisheries 
crime can be recognized as part of transnational organized crime (TOC), despite these 
efforts also have hindrance from countries that have been benefited by the fisheries 
crime this far.   
Furthermore, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia has ratified the Port State 
Measure Agreement (PSMA) through Presidential Regulation Number 43 Year 2016. 
Within this ratification, in the current stage we are in developing a Standard and 
Producer for implementing Port State Measure Agreement as a step forward to 
strengthen supervision by port authorities in preventing and combating IUU fishing.  
While our government also commit to integrate all database and monitoring systems 
in Indonesia which can increase validity and accuracy of our data from time to time 
we submit to CCSBT.  By doing so, I have a strong belief that the real action the 
Indonesian government has taken will participate in the success of the world's efforts 
to achieve sustainable management of tuna fisheries.  
Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
It is obvious that all these mentioned efforts may only be accomplished with the 
strong commitment and partnership with all of you.  Therefore, I have the pleasure to 
expect this Extended Commission Meeting is a success to achieve the objective of 
CCSBT to ensure the conservation and optimum utilization of southern Bluefin tuna 
through appropriate management. I hope through working together implementing 
measures, we could attained fruitful result and with saying Bismillah 
Hirohmannirrohim, “I declare the 24th Annual Meeting of The Commission for The 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna is officially opened”.   
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Japan 
 
Good morning.  On behalf of the Japanese Delegation, I would like to extend our 
greeting to the Chairperson and to all participants. 
First of all, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Government of 
Indonesia for hosting this meeting in Yogyakarta. 
I stayed here during the annual meeting of IOTC in May this year. Since the Extended 
Scientific Committee and Compliance Committee meetings were also held here, I 
think that many participants have already become familiar with this historical ancient 
capital. I am one of them.  
I would also like to extend our thanks to the Executive Secretary, Mr. Kennedy and 
the staff of the CCSBT Secretariat for their strenuous efforts for organizing this 
meeting, as well as to the interpreters who always do excellent job. 
At the last annual meeting, as all the participants made utmost effort, a consensus was 
reached about the next three year’s TAC and allocations for all members which were 
calculated in accordance with the management procedure agreed in 2011.  
The last Scientific Committee meeting confirmed a favorable sign toward the 
achievement of the interim rebuilding target. We have to achieve this in the not too 
distant future, giving due attention to uncertainty of stock assessment. 
Needless to say, some tasks are yet to be accomplished. Development of a new 
management procedure is one of them. While maintaining its innovativeness and 
transparency, a new approach using the gene-tagging should be put on the right track 
in cooperation with all CCSBT members. 
Furthermore, it is also necessary to resolve the problem of un-accounted mortality 
caused by each member which has been discussed over several years and the problem 
of IUU fisheries by non-members which has been identified recently with new 
information. 
Finally, I would like to conclude my remarks by hoping that we will be able to make 
an important step for the future development of the CCSBT and for the re-building of 
SBT stocks, through a constructive discussion among all participants during this four-
day meeting.  
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Tena koutou, tënä koutou, tënä koutou katoa. Nga mihi nui ki a koutou 
(Greetings to everyone gathered here) 
On behalf of the New Zealand delegation I would like to firstly thank our host 
Indonesia for its welcome and the pleasant venue provided for this meeting. We have 
been over whelmed by the fantastic food on offer here and the friendliness of the staff 
supporting this meeting. Thank you.  
I would also like to extend our thanks to the members of the Secretariat and to the 
Chairs of the CCSBT subsidiary bodies for their work throughout the year. We look 
forward to working with you all during the course of this meeting.  Our particular 
thanks go to the outgoing Chair of the Extended Scientific Committee who has served 
this Commission well for many years.  
In opening I have a number of points and expectations that I would like to outline. 
We await with interest an update from members on their application of the attributable 
catch policy adopted by this Commission.  New Zealand has clear expectations that 
members will honour their commitments to account for all sbt mortalities in a 
meaningful way. 
We are encouraged by the outcome of the recent meeting of the Extended Scientific 
Committee. We look forward to the presentation of the ESC Chair and I want to carry 
forward our view from last year that during the upcoming review of the Management 
Procedure we should be more ambitious in determining one of its key parameters, 
specifically the target of 20% of the spawning biomass by 2035.  
We have a proposal for consideration at this meeting which is intended to optimise the 
use of sbt taken in variable fisheries. The changes proposed can be of benefit to 
members that utilise the carry forward provisions of this Commission and in our view 
pose no risk to the sustainable use of the fishery. 
Finally, we remain concerned at the ongoing unresolved issues at play in this 
Commission and how they obstruct open and transparent communication between 
members and the operation of the Commission as a whole. For the moment, that is all 
I have to say about that. 
New Zealand carries forward its commitment to its role as a CCSBT member and as 
always is here to work constructively with other delegations to meet the objectives of 
the Commission.  
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Republic of Korea 
 
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen. 
On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Korea, I would like to express our 
sincere appreciation to the Republic of Indonesia for hosting the 24th session of the 
Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in this beautiful 
city of Yogkarta with their warm hospitality. And I would also like to extend my 
thanks to Executive Secretary, Mr. Robert Kennedy, his staff and local organizers for 
preparing and supporting this meeting. And I would like to further extend our 
gratitude to the Chairs of subsidiary bodies for their hard works for this Commission. 
Mr. Chairman, I would like to reiterate that the Republic of Korea is firmly committed 
itself to abide by the conservation and management measures adopted by CCSBT in 
order to ensure the sustainable use of southern bluefin tuna resources.  
It is certainly good for us to be informed that the SBT stock is this year showing more 
positive status and recovery which would be expected to reach the interim rebuilding 
target about 10 year earlier than set with the MP adoption in 2011. There are also the 
information about a higher recruitment and some consistent positive trend in the 
longline CPUE estimates in recent years, suggesing that there may be some relatively 
strong cohorts moving through the fishery. The MP has been tested with a range of 
uncertainty, including the question of unaccounted mortality and reported catch and 
others and evaluated as the robust one.  
With regard to the MCS, the Ministry of Oceans & Fisheries (MOF) operates an 
electronic reporting system to the full extent after a trial operation, applying to all 
Korean flagged distant water fishing vessels. It is the system that provides information 
including fishing efforts and catches of the vessel operating outside of Korea’s 
jurisdiction to a designated in-land office responsible for monitoring, control and 
surveillance activities via a satellite-based communication device. Also, the MOF 
introduced an electronic monitoring system in the second half of 2016 as a trial 
operation in which 4 vessels (1 Purse Seiner and 3 Longliners) engaged with aims for 
improving wellbeing of crews and on board safety and monitoring fishing operation in 
real-time through CCTV cameras.  
Mr. Chairman, this year we are assigned many important tasks under your 
chairmanship. First one is to confirm the TAC for 2018 and 2018-20 quota block in 
relation to exceptional circumstances. Second one is to consider and endorse the new 
MP development workplan which incorporated into it a range of new information and 
science developed in recent years, and the budgetary implication suggested by the 
ESC. And the last one is to consider to advice on objective and desirable behavior of 
candidate MPs building target, as the interim rebuilding target anticipated to be 
reached earlier than originally set. 
Before closing, I look forward to productive and successful outcomes for the 
conservation and sustainable use of SBT stock based on our cooperation among 
members, cooperating non-member and stakeholders.

Opening Statement by South Africa 
 
Chairperson,  
Executive Secretary,  
Esteemed Members, Delegates and Observers, all Protocol observed.  
On  behalf  of  the  delegation  of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa,  I  would  like  to 
thank the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for hosting the 24th Annual 
Meeting of the Extended Commission of the Commission for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna in this beautiful City of Yogyakarta. I would also like to 
express my deep appreciation to the CCSBT Secretariat staff for the excellent 
preparations and arrangements for this meeting. Lastly, I would like to extend my 
sincere gratitude to the interpreters.  
South Africa is one of the few range states for the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) and 
is situated close to some of this species’ most productive fishing grounds. As a 
developing nation, South Africa is well placed in terms of its geographic location and 
its available infrastructure to further develop its tuna directed fisheries and in 
particular the fishery for Southern Bluefin Tuna. 
Last year South Africa participated in the CCSBT Commission for the first time as a 
Contracting Party and as such, South Africa’s SBT Allocation was increased from 40 
to 150 tons. It is also significant to note that South Africa was granted a further 
increase in its SBT allocation for the 2018-2020 Fishing seasons from 150 tons to 450 
tons.  
It is important to note that earlier this year South Africa has allocated 59 new fishing 
rights in the Large Pelagic Longline sector for duration of 15 years. We are in the 
process of concluding the Appeals Process, with respect to decisions taken by the 
Delegated Authority responsible for the allocation of Fishing Rights.   
Esteemed delegates, last year has been an exciting year for South Africa with regards 
to the Management of the Tuna resources. Since last year South Africa is a 
Contracting Party Member to three tuna RFMOs (the CCSBT, the International 
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the Indian Ocean Tuna 
Commission). An independent law expert reviewed South Africa’s fisheries  
legislation  in  relation  to  relevant  conservation  measures  adopted  by  the various  
tuna  Regional  Fisheries  Management  Organizations,  which  South  Africa  is  a 
Contracting Party Member to. We are now in the process of amending our domestic 
legislation to incorporate the recommendations emanated from this review process.  
Having taken this step, South Africa endeavors to adhere to the all Conservation 
Management Measures as adopted by CCSBT and it is no surprise that we have 
increased our compliance with the relevant adopted measures in the last couple of 
years. We have significantly improved our reporting of all relevant data and we 
increased our Observer Coverage this year in the Large Pelagic Longline Sector to 
20%.  
Chairperson, now that South Africa is a full member of the CCSBT with an increased 
SBT allocation, an allocation system for SBT has been put in place as this species has 
now become a viable target for South African tuna fisheries. With the revised 
management system and the improved data collection efforts, individual SBT quotas 
can now be monitored and controlled.  
We have been able to strengthen our research and scientific capacity. This year South 
Africa has been an active participant at the Operating Model and Management 
Procedure Technical Meeting and the Extended Scientific Committee for the 22nd 
Meeting of the Scientific Committee meetings. Through its considerable research 
infrastructure and qualified personnel we will be able contribute significantly to the 
collection and analyses of data necessary to improve our understanding of SBT.  
Chairperson, as have been expressed in the previous Commission Meeting, South 
Africa will continue to endeavor to improve its allocation of SBT. Improved 
allocations within a thriving, well managed fishing industry will lead to the creation 
of new jobs and the improvement of the livelihoods of South African fishers and their 
families. 
Chairperson, I am confident that the 24th Annual Meeting of the Extended 
Commission of the CCSBT will have constructive, fruitful discussions and good 
decisions that are guided by mutual respect, fairness as well as by the desire to 
sustainably manage the SBT population for the benefit of all and future generations.  
I thank you.

Opening Statement by the United States of America 
 
The United States would like to begin by thanking Indonesia for the hosting the 
Twenty Fourth Annual CCSBT Commission Meeting, for the beautiful setting, and 
wonderful meeting facilities.  I also want to thank the Secretariat for their always-
excellent meeting and document preparations.   
The United States appreciates the invitation of the Commission to participate in the 
2017 annual meeting.  We are committed to continuing our cooperation with the 
CCSBT, in particular with the CDS program.  We are watching the revisions of the 
CDS and efforts to develop eCDS with interest.  As reported at the Twelfth Meeting 
of the Compliance Committee, the United States is continuing cooperation with the 
CDS through sharing of import data of SBT.  This year, the United States undertook a 
comprehensive review of trade data of highly migratory species.  Through these 
efforts, we were able to collect and submit additional CDS data from 2016, as well as 
identify import codes that are likely being misused on SBT imports.  NOAA Fisheries 
will undertake outreach and targeted enforcement efforts based on this review.  
Further, since September 20, 2016, U.S. importers have been required to submit all 
import data, including copies of CDS documents, through a single electronic 
interface, the U.S. International Trade Data System.  This should further improve 
timely collection of CDS data. 
The United States congratulates the CCSBT for its efforts to recover SBT populations.  
We want to encourage Members to continue this progress through application of the 
Management Procedure.  Taking full account of IUU activities by non-Members will 
be crucial to ensuring SBT population improvements continue.  The United States 
also calls the CCSBT to take appropriate action to conserve ERS populations, 
including through the adoption of binding mitigation measures for seabirds.  The 
CCSBT must also continue working to adopt and implement best –practice MCS 
measures, including those recommended through the Kobe process. 
Thank you again to Members for the kind invitation to the United States to participate 
in the Annual Commission Meeting.  I look forward to continuing efforts to enhance 
US cooperation with the CCSBT into the future.

Opening Statement by Humane Society International 
 
Humane Society International would like to thank the Extended Commission for the 
opportunity to participate, once again, as an observer to these important deliberations. 
HSI welcomes the good news that the target stock of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) 
seems to be recovering in response to strong recruitment.  But, there are important 
issues, like IUU-unreported and IUU-unregulated fishing by vessels authorised by 
other tuna-RFMOs, and excessive seabird deaths, that need to be resolved before any 
increase in SBT catch should be considered.  Far better to set a more ambitious target 
for stock rebuilding and to remember the rule of thumb – for every two tonnes 
increase in SBT longline catch, another albatross will be killed. 
Indeed, HSI is concerned at the bad news that albatrosses and petrels continue to be 
killed in dangerously high numbers by surface longliners authorised to fish for tuna by 
members of tuna RFMOs, especially by this one, CCSBT.  Given the overlap in the 
range and distribution of both SBT and albatrosses in high latitudes, it is impossible 
for CCSBT member states to escape responsibility for seabird deaths caused by the 
tuna longliners they authorise.   
Recent assessment of trends in population size for albatrosses and petrels by seabird 
experts working for the Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels 
(ACAP), makes for bleak reading. Of the 31 populations assessed, 21 are in decline 
and, in almost all cases, tuna longliners are primarily responsible.  In 2015, ACAP 
identified CCSBT as the responsible body where priority conservation action was 
needed to better protect 20 populations of albatrosses and petrels.  No such action has 
yet been decided upon. 
Feral animals on islands where albatrosses and petrels nest, are also problematic but, 
in recent years, conservation-minded coastal states have been investing tens of 
millions of dollars a year to address these and other land-based problems such that 
eradication programmes are either complete or in train.  The technical and financial 
resources for this admirable control effort have come from both conservation agencies 
and civil society.  It’s time for tuna fishers and fisheries agencies to match this effort. 
We are faced with a stubborn refusal by tuna RFMO member states, especially at 
CCSBT, to agree to take timely and effective action to prevent albatrosses and petrels 
from being killed in unacceptably high numbers by the fisheries they authorise and 
claim to manage.  Unless something changes, tuna-RFMOs are going to lose 
international legitimacy because of this failure. 
Last year, CCSBT members had to confront the evidence from their own national 
reports that, despite entry into force of seabird mortality mitigation measures by the 
other four tuna RFMOs, seabird deaths are actually increasing, not decreasing.  
Members responded by asking the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
(ERS-WG) to advise whether there were improvements in these mitigation measures 
that CCSBT could recommend to the other RFMOs.  This was a development HSI 
was pleased to support. 
The ERS-WG only managed to ‘note’ the ACAP best practice advice that, in high risk 
high latitude waters – where authorised SBT longliners fish – there should be 
mandatory use of all three mitigation strategies: (i) use of adequately weighted 
longlines; (ii) line setting only at night; and (iii) use of streamers/tori lines.   
Instead, we see a proposed mitigation measure that only mandates the carriage of tori 
poles and continues to recognise optional deployment of mitigation strategies – 
despite the evidence that optional deployment doesn’t work.  The proposed measure is 
derisory in: (i) its failure to acknowledge that existing measures don’t work; (ii) its 
failure to reflect advice from the expert body recognised by the international 
community – ACAP; and (iii) its apparent ignorance of the success of CCAMLR in 
successfully maintaining seabird mortality at near-zero levels - despite the overlap in 
states party to both CCSBT and CCAMLR. 
What HSI hopes to see from this meeting of the Extended Commission is the adoption 
of a seabird mitigation measure, consistent with ACAP best practice advice, as noted 
in the ERS-WG report, that: (i)  mandates the use of adequately weighted longlines as 
recommended by ACAP best practice advice in high risk areas; (ii) mandates that 
longlines may only be set at night; and, as a complement rather than an alternative, 
(iii) mandates the use of appropriately designed and deployed streamers/tori lines. 
Furthermore, consistent with its decision last year and subsequent report of the ERS-
WG, HSI hopes that the Extended Commission will recommend to the other four tuna 
RFMOs that their seabird mitigation measure be upgraded to ensure consistency with 
ACAP best practice advice. 
As ever, the key test of whether fisheries managers are taking their seabird mortality 
mitigation responsibilities seriously remains: do they mandate the use of adequately 
weighted longlines and do they have reporting and inspection arrangements sufficient 
to ensure compliance and effectiveness.   
Thank you Chair and Members for your time. 
Attachment 5 – 3 
 
Opening Statement by TRAFFIC and WWF 
 
Thank you Mr Chairman. 
TRAFFIC and WWF thank the Commission for the opportunity to participate as an 
observer to meetings of the Extended Commission and its other subsidiary bodies. We 
thank Indonesia for hosting this meeting and the Secretariat for the preparation. We 
look forward to contributing to these critical deliberations.  
TRAFFIC and WWF welcome indications that the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) 
stock is showing signs of higher recruitment but we believe that issues remain. These 
include the long-term rebuilding target, unaccounted mortality, and compliance by 
Members, which we hope will be addressed at this meeting. 
While the annual total allowable catch (TAC) has increased in recent years, the stock 
is estimated still to be at an extremely low level – approximately 13% of the initial 
Spawning Stock Biomass, well below the level considered to be biologically safe. We 
ask the Commission urgently to work to minimize the uncertainties and data gaps 
affecting the Operating Model and increase the probability of reaching the rebuilding 
target.  
Although the Scientific Committee mentioned the possibility that the interim 
rebuilding target may be reached earlier than 2035, we urge the Commission to act 
with a precautionary approach in mind. Specifically, when considering the 
Management Procedures pre- and post-rebuilding, we ask the Commission to develop 
a new Management Procedure to reach the interim rebuilding target as soon as 
possible. Also to define the long-term biologically safe target for rebuilding of the 
SBT stock and its timeframe so as to manage the fisheries to achieve the maximum 
sustainable yield (MSY).  
We remind the Commission how the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working 
Group mentioned at the meeting in 2010 that the ultimate goal of SBT management 
was to rebuild the SBT stock to a biomass level that supports the MSY. Given that the 
SBT global TAC has reached a historical high since the CCSBT was established in 
1993, it is timely for the Commission to enter into the next phase of SBT 
management. 
Unaccounted mortality catch remains a crucial issue relating to potential under-
reporting by Members and catch and discard by Non-Members. We welcome that the 
common definition of attributable catch will be fully implemented from the 2018 
quota year. TRAFFIC and WWF urge Members to share information on the 
attributable catch to enable cross-checking of whether those estimates are 
comprehensive enough to infer unaccounted mortality; the accuracy of CCSBT 
Members’ efforts in this regard will assist greatly to understand the significance of 
Non-members’ by-catch. 
As the Scientific Committee mentioned, we believe that it is urgent to quantify all 
sources of unaccounted SBT mortality and take necessary actions on the issue. 
TRAFFIC and WWF ask the Commission to prioritize this matter and make every 
effort in quantifying estimates for all sources of unaccounted mortality. In the event 
the Commission is unable to quantify these estimates, we urge the Commission to be 
more precautionary and to set-aside a larger amount than the 306 tonnes currently 
considered to account for IUU catch by Non-Members. At the same time, we urge the 
Commission to ask other relevant regional fisheries management organizations 
(RFMOs) and their Members to co-operate with submitting information and data on 
SBT mortality. 
CCSBT Members need to ensure they comply with both catch and trade regulations of 
the Commission. We encourage the Commission to scrutinize the catch and trade data 
records from the CCSBT Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS), FAO catch 
production, UN Comtrade and Customs to assess consistency, and to highlight any 
identified discrepancies. We also urge the Commission to make documents and 
reports publicly available to improve transparency and address trade related issues.  
Regarding Ecologically Related Species (ERS), we urge the Comission to clarify 
which shark and ray species are caught as bycatch in SBT fisheries and their 
mortality. Although the ERS Working Group has not expressed specific concerns 
about shark bycatch in SBT fisheries, we encourage the Commission to collect 
relevant data and instruct the Scientific Committee and ERS Working Group to 
consider the prioritisation of research and management for affected shark and ray 
species. 
Scientific observers play an important role in ensuring the compliance of management 
measures and collecting information on ERS. We are concerned that some Members 
have not reached the target level of 10% observer coverage of catch and effort, which 
was agreed in the CCSBT Scientific Observer Program Standards. We encourage the 
Commission to ensure that Members comply with these Standards and to consider 
ensuring observer safety and security in SBT fisheries by revising the Standards as 
nescessary. In light of the increased number of juvenile fish, we also urge the 
Comission to strengthen the monitoring of SBT fisheries including but not limited to 
increasing the observer coverage on longline vessels and implementing best practice 
stereo video monitoring. 
TRAFFIC and WWF urge Members to make the necessary decisions, with the 
required sense of urgency, in order to conserve effectively SBT and other ERS, 
especially sharks, seabirds and marine turtles.  
As a final note to the Commissioners, we ask that this week the plenary of the 
Commission remains as a forum for discussions and decisions so that we can all 
participate, thus ensuring that the CCSBT process can be open and transparent.  
Thank you, Mr Chairman. 
Attachment 6 
Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
Dominic Vallières (New Zealand) agreed to chair the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC). The FAC was tasked with the following agenda:  

Revision of the 2017 budget

Draft 2018 budget

Draft indicative budgets for 2019 and 2020
The revised budget for 2017 
The Executive Secretary gave a summary of the 2017 revised budget outlined in 
CCSBT-EC/1710/05. The revision incorporates actual income and expenditure as at 
31 August 2017 together with forecast income and expenditure for the remainder of 
the year.  
The Executive Secretary identified a further $37,400 in cost reductions to the FAC.  
With these reductions, expenditure for 2017 is forecast to total $2,840,810, which is 
5.1% lower than the amount which had been budgeted. These reductions along with a 
slightly higher return on investments have allowed for a smaller than planned 
withdrawal from savings.  The Executive Secretary also wished to note the voluntary 
and in-kind contributions made by Australia, the European Union, Indonesia, New 
Zealand and the CSIRO. 
Members of the FAC thanked the Secretariat for its efforts to reduce costs given the 
budgeting constraints faced by the Commission. 
The Executive Secretary provided additional details on individual items of the revised 
2017 budget where significant changes had occurred from the initially planned 
amounts.  These included: 

A reduction in travel and Secretariat staffing costs based on a higher
Australian dollar;

An increase in the costs of the Extended Scientific Committee equipment hire;

A refund of $87,560 from CSIRO due to savings on aircraft charter as part of
the Scientific Aerial Survey;

A 10% increase  in the cost of research programs ($103,000) and office
management and insurance costs ($14,000) all based on a ruling by the
Australian Taxation Office (ATO), which removed a previously claimed
exemption to the Australian Goods and Services Tax (GST).
In response to questions from FAC members, the Executive Secretary clarified that 
the CCSBT had previously been considered exempt from paying GST. However, the 
ATO advised the Secretariat that its tax exemptions under the Commission for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (Privileges and Immunities) Regulations 1996 
did not apply to the services component of the GST or to goods under $200. The 
Commission’s Headquarters Agreement came into effect before the GST existed in 
Australia and the GST is therefore not mentioned amongst the exemptions listed in 
the Headquarters Agreement. FAC members expressed concern at the financial 
implications of this ruling and the potential impact in terms of this Commission’s 
ability to meet its management objectives for the stock.  Some members noted the 
responsibilities associated with the hosting of an international organisation and urged 
both the Secretariat and Australia to take steps to remedy the situation. 
Australia advised the FAC that resolving this issue was a priority and that initial steps 
had already been taken towards that aim.  
The FAC thanked the Executive Secretary for the work done on the budget.  
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission note the revised budget for 
2017 at Annex A. 
 
Draft budget for 2018  
The FAC considered the proposed budgets outlined in CCSBT-EC/1710/06 which 
includes funding for the CCSBT’s usual business including the ESC’s three year work 
plan. The draft budget contained $61,700 more in expenditure than the interim budget 
which had been previously circulated to Members. The increase in expenditure was 
primarily driven by an increase related to close-kin identification and data exchange 
along with ESC requests for additional resources at meetings.  
To reflect comments made in plenary, FAC members were also asked to consider 
budgetary options that would allow a meeting of the Strategy and Fisheries 
Management Working Group (SFMWG) in 2018. FAC members expressed a desire to 
remain within the expenditure limits of the draft budget and looked to fund the 
SFMWG primarily through savings.  
Based on the assumption of venues that could be provided at no cost to the CCSBT 
and proximity of secretariat staff and/or interpreters, both Canberra and Tokyo were 
suggested as likely venues for the SFMWG. Australia confirmed that it could provide 
a venue were the meeting to be held in Canberra.  
The FAC noted that although Chairing arrangements for the next SFMWG had yet to 
be discussed, the Chair of previous SFMWG meetings have been provided by the host 
country.  No funding was budgeted for the next SFMWG Chair with the 
understanding that the Member that provides the Chair will also cover their costs. 
In order to secure sufficient savings to offset the additional costs of the SFMWG, the 
FAC declined the ESC request for an additional member of the Independent Scientific 
Advisory Panel to transition through the retirement of one of its current members. The 
FAC withdrew the request for additional funding for the ESC Chair to attend the next 
meeting of the OMMP. New Zealand also agreed to support some of the costs of the 
technical consultant to the Independent Scientific Advisory Panel as it did in the 
previous year. FAC also withdrew expenditures linked to attendance by a CCSBT 
representative at the Ecosystem Based Management Workshop based on the fact that 
the nominee would be from one of the Members and not require the costs associated 
with allowances and travel. 
The EU also stated that its voluntary contributions to the gene tagging programme 
were made in order to allow implementation to take place at a time when scientific 
research funding was particularly onerous but that these contributions should not be 
seen as an alternative to normal Commission funding. The EU will fund the gene 
tagging programme in 2018 and will continue to consider other vital projects to the 
Commission for funding beyond that date. 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission approve the 2018 General 
Budget as set out in Annex B to this document.  
 
Indicative budgets for 2019 and 2020 
The FAC was also asked to consider indicative budgets for the two years beyond the 
upcoming budget.  Members of the FAC examined the indicative budgets and looked 
for potential savings that could be made. 
South Africa announced that it was willing to extend its previous commitment to 
cover the costs of venue hire and catering associated to now also include the Extended 
Scientific Committee.  This change resulted in savings of approximately $40,000 to 
the indicative 2019 budget. Members thanked South Africa for its generosity in 
making this additional contribution. 
The Executive Secretary highlighted two meetings in the indicative budgets for 2019 
and 2020 which carry significant additional expenses. These are the MP consultation 
meeting in 2019 and the MP contingency meeting in 2020.  
With reference to the two meetings above, the FAC has recommended that the 
withdrawal from savings in 2018 should be limited to allow for the possibility of these 
proceeding. The FAC requested that the ESC confirm the need for and scope of both 
meetings at ESC 23 to allow effective costings. 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission note the proposed changes to 
the indicative 2019 and 2020 budgets.

4  For 2017, Indonesia is the host Member and has paid venue hire, catering and equipment hire 
directly to the venue.  In 2018, the EU is the host and the EU intends to provide a grant to the CCSBT 
Secretariat for the Secretariat to pay the catering and venue and equipment hire components of these 
costs. The necessary grant income is included in the budget.  For 2019, South Africa has indicated that 
it will cover these expenses for the CC/EC and ESC meetings and hence the cost for this component of 
these meetings is shown as zero (except for miscellaneous expenses).
5  For 2017, New Zealand paid the full costs for participation by the technical consultant for this 
meeting, thus reducing the cost to the CCSBT.

Attachment 9 
 
Resolution on Limited Carry-forward of Unfished Annual Total Available Catch 
of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
(Adopted at the Twenty Fourth Annual Meeting – 9 – 12 October 2017) 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
Noting the “Resolution on the Adoption of a Management Procedure” was adopted at 
the eighteenth annual meeting in 2011; 
Further noting that the above resolution adopted a management procedure that sets 
the global total allowable catch (TAC) for southern bluefin tuna in three year blocks; 
Considering the need for Members to effectively manage their total available catch 
within each quota year and to allow limited carry-forward of Member’s annual total 
available catch; 
Recognising that a provision to carry-forward undercatch can benefit the fishery by 
providing catch flexibility between quota years; 
Informed that such a provision will not have a negative effect on the operation of the 
current Management Procedure and the setting of global TACs; 
Mindful that this carry-forward provision may present administrative complexities for 
some Members, and that it should therefore be up to each Member whether it wishes 
to implement the provision for its vessels; 
Agrees in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8, that: 
 
Section 1: Establishment of a Carry-forward Procedure 
1.  The Extended Commission hereby establishes a procedure for limited carry 
forward of Members’ un-fished annual total available catch1. 
2.  Members shall decide whether or not to carry-forward un-fished total available 
catch. However, if a Member decides to carry-forward unfished quota, such 
carry-forward shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures defined in 
sections 2 – 4 below. 
                                           
1 Total available catch means a Member’s Effective Catch Limit allocation for that quota year plus any amount of 
unfished allocation carried forward to that quota year. 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 2: Carry-Forward Procedure 
3.  If a Member’s annual total available catch is under-caught, that Member may 
carry forward the unfished quota to the following quota year. However, the total 
quota carried forward from one year to the next shall not exceed 20% of that 
Member’s Effective Catch Limit for the year from which the quota is being 
carried forward. 
4.  A Member’s total available catch for a quota year shall not exceed the sum of its 
national allocation for that year plus an amount equal to 20% of its national 
allocation for the previous quota year. 
Section 3: Notification and Reporting of Carry-Forward Procedure 
5.  The Secretariat shall seek confirmation from Members at the end of the quota 
year as to whether they intend to carry forward unfished quota to the next quota 
year. Members that have elected to carry forward unfished quota shall provide 
confirmation to the Secretariat within 90 days of receipt of the request and shall 
include a revised total available catch limit for the new quota year.  
6.  Members shall report on their use of the procedure in their annual reports to the 
Extended Commission, regardless of whether the procedure was in fact used by 
the Member during that quota year.  
Section 4: Circumstances When Carry-Forward Is Not Applicable 
7.  If, on the basis of advice from the Extended Scientific Committee that 
exceptional circumstances exist that necessitate additional management action, 
the Extended Commission agrees to reduce the global total allowable catch within 
a three year quota block, the carry-forward procedures provided in this resolution 
shall not be applied by any Member. 
8.  If the Extended Commission agrees within a three year quota block to reduce the 
national allocation of one or more Members, that Member or those members shall 
not apply the carry- forward procedures provided in this resolution unless decided 
otherwise by the Extended Commission taking into account the circumstances of 
the reduction. 
9.  If either the Management Procedure recommends, or the Extended Commission 
decides on a lower Global TAC, then the carry-forward procedures provided for 
 
 
 
 
 
in this Resolution shall not be applied by any Member unless decided otherwise 
by the Extended Commission. 
10.  If a Member exceeds its national allocation for the 2017 fishing season or later 
without paying back its excess catch for those seasons, the carry-forward 
procedures provided in this resolution shall not be applied by that Member until 
those catches have been paid back, unless otherwise agreed by the Extended 
Commission. 
Section 5: General Provisions 
11.  The procedures in this Resolution shall take effect immediately upon adoption. 
12.  Following the adoption of a new Management Procedure the Extended 
Commission shall review and amend, if necessary, this Resolution taking into 
account the advice of the Extended Scientific Committee.  
13. This resolution replaces and supersedes the “Resolution on Limited Carry-
forward of Unfished Annual Total Allowable Catch of Southern Bluefin Tuna” 
that was adopted at the Twenty-First Annual Meeting.

Australian information paper on the Draft Resolution to Mitigate the Impact on 
Seabirds of Fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna 
 
We refer to queries about the following wording in the paragraphs 6, 10 and 12 in 
Australia’s proposed seabirds measure: 
 
‘Members and CNMs shall ensure that all longline vessels flying their flag 
that are fishing for southern bluefin tuna (whether those vessels are targeting 
southern bluefin tuna or not) in the area…’  
 
The bracketed words ‘whether those vessels are targeting southern bluefin tuna or not’ 
are intended to ensure that the measure covers all vessels that are actually fishing for 
SBT, even if this was not the intention of the vessels operators at the time – i.e., in 
circumstances where the vessel operators might assert they were targeting another 
tuna species but actually caught SBT. As such, the measure would only apply to 
vessels that are actually fishing for SBT (eg preparing to catch SBT or actually 
catching SBT) and so would not be outside of the CCSBT’s area of competence, 
which extends to SBT as a species (under Article 1) and clearly covers fishing for 
SBT.  
 
Additionally, from a practical point of view, a vessel that was not targeting SBT but 
was nevertheless ‘fishing for southern Bluefin tuna’ eg under paragraph 6, would still 
be required to comply with the equivalent seabird mitigation obligations under 
paragraph 5 of IOTC CMM 12/06. There would therefore be no extra burden from a 
regulatory point of view for a vessel, or a danger that a vessel might be caught out by 
complying with the wrong measure – as they are materially the same.  
 
In relation to ICCAT measures and the latitudes included in paragraphs 12 and 13 of 
the proposed measure: the intention here was to translate across the relevant 
obligations in paragraph 4 of ICCAT measure 07-07 (see p117)–which applies to 
vessels south of 20 degrees South in paragraph 12, and then the obligations in 
paragraph 3 of ICCAT supplemental measure 11-09 which apply to vessels south of 
25 degrees South in paragraph 13 of the proposed measure. Australia would welcome 
advice from ICCAT members, if we have misinterpreted these two measures in any 
way.  
 
In terms of the swordfish exemption, we assume this is a reference to paragraph 5 of 
ICCAT measure 07-07. We are open to considering the need for a similar exemption 
here, but query if such vessels using monofilament longline gear might 
unintentionally end up ‘fishing for’ SBT. If not, then we query whether an exemption 
needs to be included, as this activity (fishing for swordfish) would not fall within 
scope of the proposed measure.  
 
As set out in the chapeau of the draft Resolution, Australia considers it is within the 
Extended Commission’s competence to pass this measure as a necessary ‘additional 
measure’ for the management of SBT in accordance with Article 8(3) (b) of the 
Convention. In passing measures under Article 8 paragraph 3 the Commission can 
consider among other things ‘scientific evidence’ (per Article 8(4)(a)), including in 
relation to ‘ecologically related species’, in accordance with Article 9(2)(c).  
 
Further, it is in line with ‘General Principles’ provisions of the United Nations Fish 
Stocks Agreement (UNFSA). In particular, Article 5 (e) requires States Parties, 
through Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs), to adopt 
appropriate measures to conserve and manage species which are not the target species 
but which are ecologically related to the target stocks, and Article 5 (f) requires States 
Parties, through RFMOs, to minimise catch of non-target species through measures 
including the use of selective, environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear 
and techniques where practicable. We note that all Parties to the Convention for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna are also Parties to the UNFSA. 
 
Finally, we note the Commission has considered ecologically related species matters 
since soon after the Convention came into force. These matters are clearly a core 
consideration of the Commission, and this has been reflected in a range of consensus 
decisions over a number of years. 
Attachment 13 
 
Resolution on the Allocation of the Global Total Allowable Catch 
(updated at the Twenty-Fourth Annual Meeting – 9-12 October 2017) 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
 
Seized by the need to ensure the conservation and optimum utilisation of southern bluefin 
tuna based on the best available scientific advice, 
 
Recalling agreement reached on nominal catch levels at the 16th annual meeting of the 
Extended Commission meeting and the Resolution on the Total Allowable Catch and Future 
Management of Southern Bluefin Tuna adopted at that meeting, 
 
Further to the Resolution on the Adoption of a Management Procedure adopted at the annual 
meeting of the Extended Commission in 2011, 
 
Noting that the Management Procedure is the basis for setting the total allowable catch since 
2012, 
 
Taking into account the desirability of a transparent and stable process for allocating total 
allowable catch to Members and Cooperating Non-Members, which provides greater 
certainty to Members and Cooperating non-Members, in particular for their fishing industries, 
and facilitates the administration of national allocations, 
 
Recalling the Extended Commission agreed at it special meeting in 2011 to principles that 
would apply to the distribution of any increase in the global total allowable catch under the 
Management Procedure, 
 
Further recalling the changes to nominal catch proportions agreed in 2016,  
 
In accordance with paragraph 3(a) of Article 8 of the Convention for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna, the Extended Commission decides as follows: 
 
1. 
The total allowable catch (TAC) set on the basis of the Management Procedure (MP)1 
shall be allocated among Members and Cooperating Non-Members according to this 
Resolution.   
 
2. 
Unless this Resolution provides otherwise, the TAC shall be allocated among 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members based on Members’ nominal catch 
percentage levels set out in the Annex and paragraph 6 of this Resolution. 
 
3. 
If there is no change to the TAC, each Member’s allocation will remain unchanged. 
 
 
4. 
If there is an increase to the TAC, the additional tonnage will be allocated amongst 
the Members based on the nominal catch percentage level as set out in the Annex to 
this Resolution.  
 
                                                 
1The Management Procedure agreed to under the Resolution on the Adoption of a Management Procedure adopted at the 
annual meeting of the Extended Commission in 2011, and any subsequent revisions to that Resolution. 
5. 
If there is a decrease to the TAC, each Member’s allocation will decrease consistent 
with its nominal catch percentage level.  However, the European Union’s allocation 
will not decrease below 10 tonnes. 
 
6. 
Each Cooperating Non-Member shall receive a fixed amount of the TAC, subject to 
the annual review of their status as a Cooperating Non-Member. 
 
7. 
The Extended Commission may decide on an amount of the TAC to set aside for 
Research Mortality Allowance and for IUU catch by Non-Members.  These amounts 
will be deducted from the TAC before allocation of the TAC to Members. 
 
8. 
The allocation of the TAC may be revised with the entry of new Members and 
Cooperating Non-Members. The nominal catch levels will remain unchanged with the 
entry of new Members or Cooperating Non-Members, but the nominal catch 
percentage levels may change.

RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE PROTECTION, ACCESS TO, 
AND DISSEMINATION OF DATA COMPILED BY THE CCSBT  
(updated 12 October 2017) 
 
1. Basic principles relating to the dissemination of the data by the CCSBT under these 
rules 
 
1. Data and information specified in Table 1 and held by the CCSBT or its Secretariat, and by 
service providers or contractors acting on their behalf, shall only be released in accordance 
with these Rules and Procedures. 
 
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, data may be released if the Member (or Cooperating Non-
Member) of the Extended Commission providing the data to the CCSBT authorises its 
release. 
 
3. Persons duly authorised by the Executive Secretary within the CCSBT Secretariat1 and 
service providers, who have read and signed the Commission’s confidentiality protocol, 
shall have access to the data necessary to perform their CCSBT duties.  
 
4. Officers of the Commission2 and its subsidiary bodies, who have read and signed the 
Commission’s confidentiality protocol, shall have access to the data necessary to perform 
their CCSBT duties.  
 
5. Members and Cooperating Non-Members (CNM) of the Extended Commission shall have 
access to data to serve the purposes of the Convention, including data:  
 
(a) covering vessels flying their flag that were authorised or engaged in fishing for, 
retaining on board, transhipping or landing southern bluefin tuna.  
 
(b) covering any vessels fishing in waters under their jurisdiction for the time period during 
which such fishing occurred.  
 
(c) for the purpose of scientific and other research, if the Member or CNM of the Extended 
Commission that originally provided that data authorises the Extended Commission to 
release them or if the data have a “No risk” or “Low” confidentiality risk classification 
according to Table 13.  In cases where a Member or CNM of the Extended Commission 
elects to provide an ongoing authorisation for the release of such data, the Member or 
CNM may at any time cancel this authorisation by notifying the Secretariat that it has 
revised its earlier decision.  
 
6. To the greatest extent practical, the CCSBT, its Secretariat and their service providers or 
contractors acting on their behalf, should release data in a timely manner. 
 
 
                                                 
1 Persons duly authorised by the Executive Secretary within the CCSBT Secretariat are Secretariat staff and contractors that 
are appointed by the Executive Secretary that are responsible to the Executive Secretary. 
2 Officers of the Commission are people appointed by the Commission (e.g. Independent Chairs, Scientific Advisory Panel) 
to perform a specific function for the Commission and are responsible to the Commission for this function. 
3 These data are typically made available to Members through the private area of the CCSBT web site or the CCSBT Data 
CD. 
 
2. Risk classification and definition of confidentiality  
 
7. Data covered by these Rules and Procedures will be classified in accordance with the risk 
classification methodology included in Table 1, which reflects inter alia the damage that 
would be done to the operations or credibility of the Extended Commission as a 
consequence of the unauthorised disclosure of such information.  
 
8. Data covered by these Rules and Procedures are determined to be either public domain or 
non-public domain data in accordance with the confidentiality risk classification established 
in Table 1.  
 
 
3. Dissemination of Public Domain Data  
 
9. Except for data as described in Paragraph 10, the types of data listed in Table 1 with a “No 
risk” classification have been designated to be Public Domain data.  
 
10. Data in the public domain shall not reveal the individual activities or identity of any vessel, 
entity or person. Catch and Effort data in the public domain shall be aggregated by flag, 
gear, year, month and 1ºx1º grid (for surface fisheries) or 5ºx5º grid (for longline fisheries) 
and, provided that the data contains information on the number of vessels in a strata, shall 
be made up of observations from a minimum of three vessels. 
 
11. Public Domain data shall be available to any persons for (a) downloading from the 
Commission’s website and/or (b) release by the Commission on request.  
 
12. The Commission’s website should contain a statement describing the conditions associated 
with the viewing or downloading of Public Domain data (for example, that the source of 
the data must be acknowledged), and should require the person requesting the data to 
“Accept” these conditions before viewing or downloading can begin.  
 
 
4. Dissemination of Non-Public Domain Data  
 
 
4.1 Definition of Non-Public Domain Data  
 
13. Subject to the decisions of the Extended Commission, all types of data not described in 
paragraph 9 shall be referred to as Non-Public Domain data.  
 
 
4.2 General rules for dissemination of, and access to, Non-Public Domain data  
 
14. All access to and dissemination of Non-Public Domain data shall only be authorised in 
accordance with these Rules and Procedures and shall be protected in accordance with the 
CCSBT Data Security Standards specified in Attachment 1.  
 
15. The CCSBT Secretariat shall log and report to the Extended Commission all access and 
release of Non-Public Domain data with a “Medium” or High” risk classification including 
where applicable, the name and affiliation of the person, the type of data accessed or 
released, the purpose for which the data were requested, the date when the data were 
requested, the date when the data were released and authorisations that were provided. 
 
 
 
4.3 Access to Non-Public Domain data by the Staff of the Secretariat, the CCSBT Service 
Providers, and Officers of the Commission and its Subsidiary Bodies  
 
16. Pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4, persons duly authorised by the Executive Secretary, within 
the CCSBT Secretariat and service providers, including the scientific advisory panel, shall 
have access to the data necessary to perform their CCSBT duties. Officers of the 
Commission and its subsidiary bodies shall have access to the data necessary to perform 
their CCSBT duties. All such persons shall sign a Confidentiality Agreement with the 
Executive Secretary and maintain the CCSBT Data Security Standards in respect of data to 
which they have access. The Executive Secretary shall maintain a Register of all such 
persons (including the purpose for which they require access to the data) and make the 
Register available to a Member or CNM of the Extended Commission on written request.  
 
 
4.4 Access to Non-Public Domain data by Members and CNMs of the Extended 
Commission 
 
17. Members and CNMs of the Extended Commission shall have access to Non-Public Domain 
data to serve the purposes of the Convention, including data:  
(a) Covering vessels flying their flag that were authorised or engaged in fishing for, 
retaining on board, transhipping or landing southern bluefin tuna.  
(b) Covering any vessels fishing in waters under their jurisdiction for the time period during 
which such fishing occurred.  
 (c) For the purpose of scientific and other research, if the Member or CNM of the Extended 
Commission that originally provided that data authorises the Extended Commission to 
release them or if the data have a “Low” confidentiality risk classification according to 
Table 13.  In cases where a Member or CNM of the Extended Commission elects to 
provide an ongoing authorisation for the release of such data, the Member or CNM may 
at any time cancel this authorisation by notifying the Secretariat that it has revised its 
earlier decision. 
 
18. Members and CNMs of the Extended Commission shall notify the Secretariat of a small 
number of representatives (preferably only 2) authorised to submit requests4 for access to 
Non-Public Domain data. Such notification will include name, affiliation, and contact 
information (e.g. telephone, facsimile, email address). The CCSBT Secretariat will maintain 
a list of such authorised representatives. Members and CNMs of the Extended Commission 
and the Secretariat shall ensure the list of Member and CNM representatives is kept up to 
date and made available.  
 
19. The authorised representative(s) of the Members and CNMs of the Extended Commission 
are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality and security of the Non-Public Domain data 
according to its risk classification and in a manner consistent with the CCSBT Data Security 
Standards.  
 
                                                 
4 The requests by the authorised representatives would usually be to grant access to data for other people (e.g. scientists), not 
for themselves.  For data classified with a “low risk”, the only requests that need to be made are requests for access to 
relevant parts of the private area of the CCSBT web site.  These requests can be handled by simple e-mail correspondence 
directly with the Secretariat.  For data with a “medium” or “high” risk, the procedures in Attachment 2 must be followed. 
 
20. Access to Non-Public Domain data by Members and CNMs of the Extended Commission 
shall be administered and authorised by the Executive Secretary on the basis of these Rules 
and Procedures in conjunction with the Procedures for Requesting the Release of Non-
Public Domain data at Attachment 2. 
 
21. A Member or CNM that has not fulfilled its obligations to provide data to the Extended 
Commission for two consecutive years shall not be granted access to Non-Public Domain 
data until all such obligations are met. A Member or CNM whose representative, authorised 
in accordance with paragraphs 18 and 19 above, failed to observe the rules stipulated in 
these Rules and Procedures shall not be granted access to Non-Public Domain data until 
appropriate actions have been taken.  
 
 
4.5 Exchange of data with other regional fisheries management organisations  
 
22. If the Commission enters into agreements for the exchange of data with other regional 
fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) or other organisations, such agreements must 
include requirements that the other RFMO provides equivalent data on a reciprocal basis 
and maintains the data provided to them in a manner consistent with the CCSBT Data 
Security Standards. The data that may be exchanged are data with a risk classification of 
“no risk” or “low risk”.  Data with higher risk classifications may only be considered for 
sharing after specific approval from the Extended Commission. At each annual session the 
Executive Secretary will provide copies of data exchange agreements that exist with other 
RFMOs and a summary of the data exchanges that occurred during the previous 12 months 
under such agreements. 
 
 
4.5 Disseminations of Non-Public Domain data in other circumstances  
 
23. Non-Public Domain data will be made available by the Secretariat to any persons5 if the 
Member or CNM of the Extended Commission that originally provided that data authorises 
the Extended Commission to release them. In cases where a Member or CNM of the 
Extended Commission elects to provide an ongoing authorisation for the release of such 
data, the Member or CNM may at any time cancel this authorisation by notifying the 
Secretariat that it has revised its earlier decision. 
 
24. Conditions for access to Non-Public Domain data by each non-Member shall be determined 
on a case by case basis by the Member or CNM of the Extended Commission that originally 
provided the data.  At the discretion of that Member or CNM, these conditions may or may 
not involve procedures similar to those specified at Attachment 2. 
  
 
4.6 Force majeure  
 
25. The Executive Secretary may authorise the release of Non-Public Domain data to rescue 
agencies in cases of force majeure in which the safety of life at sea is at risk. 
 
 
5. Periodic Review  
 
                                                 
5 Including universities, researchers, NGOs, media, consultants, industry, federations, etc. 
 
26. The Extended Commission or its subsidiary bodies will periodically review these Rules and 
Procedures, and subsidiary documents, and amend these if necessary.  
 
27. When considering the provision of data not specified in Table 1, the Extended Commission 
or its subsidiary bodies should consider an appropriate risk classification for that data for 
inclusion in Table 1. 
 
 
6. Final Clause  
28. These Rules and Procedures do not prevent a Member or CNM from authorising the release 
of any data it has provided to the CCSBT. 
 
Table 1: Types of information and confidentiality risk classification.   
Information types that have not received a risk classification within this table will not be managed 
within these confidentiality rules.  However, this table may be updated by the Extended Commission 
from time to time, including through intercessional agreement between Members of the Extended 
Commission, as required. 
 
With the exception of approved summaries of certain information types below, the following broad 
dissemination principles apply to the four confidentiality risk classifications6: 
• 
“No risk”:  Publicly available and may be placed on the public area of the CCSBT web site. 
• 
“Low Risk”:  Not publicly available.  However, unless stated otherwise, these data are 
available to all Members and CNMs without specific approval and may be placed on the 
private area of the CCSBT web site and on the CCSBT Data CD.  These data may also be 
shared with other RFMOs subject to paragraph 22. 
• 
“Medium Risk”:  Not publicly available.  Requires specific authorisation to be released.  May 
not be placed on the CCSBT Data CD or on the private area of the CCSBT web site (unless in 
a special part of the private area that is further restricted to specifically authorised people). 
• 
“High Risk”:  Not publicly available.  Requires specific authorisation to be released.  May not 
be placed on the CCSBT Data CD or on the private area of the CCSBT web site.

Attachment 1 
 
CCSBT Data Confidentiality Security Policy (DCSP) 
 
The purpose of this policy is to help ensure that non-public data (within this attachment only, 
non-public data is referred to as “Data”) is provided to and managed by Data receivers in a 
manner that maintains confidentiality.  This policy is not intended to cover aspects of data 
security that are not related to protection of confidentiality, such as loss or damage to data 
(e.g. through fire, flood, accident, systems malfunction etc.). 
 
Data receivers (including the CCSBT Secretariat) are required to manage the security of Data 
to at least the standards specified below.  The standards below are intentionally brief in order 
to provide a clear overview of the scope of the requirements.  Further information can be 
obtained on most items from ISO/IEC 27002:2005(e)15. 
 
The Executive Secretary may impose additional security requirements before releasing 
specific Data.  The receiver of the Data will be required to observe any such additional 
security requirements.  The Executive Secretary may also waive specific security 
requirements if requested to do so by the provider of the Data. 
 
1) Human Resources Security 
• For data with a risk classification of “medium” or “high”, only people approved by the 
Executive Secretary (herein referred to as “Approved People”) shall be allowed access 
to the Data by the receiving organisation (herein referred to as “The Organisation”).  
For data with a “low” risk classification, people approved by the receiving Member or 
CNM shall be allowed to access the data (also referred to herein as “Approved 
People”).; 
• The Organisation shall have appropriate terms and conditions in its 
contract/arrangement with Approved People to state their responsibilities for 
information security and to enable disciplinary action for Approved People who 
commit a security breach. 
• Approved People shall be provided, as appropriate, with information security 
awareness education and training by The Organisation. 
• The Organisation shall have termination procedures in place for maintaining 
confidentiality from Approved People whose role or employment changes.  This will 
include as a minimum, the return or secure disposal16 of the Data, cancellation of 
access to the Data by such approved people, and for Approved People with approval 
for  access to “medium” and High” risk  data, notification to the Executive Secretary 
of the person’s changed status together with the action taken. 
 
                                                 
15 International Standard on “Information technology – Security techniques – Code of practise for information security 
management”. 
16 For data with a “medium” or “high” risk classification, “Secure Disposal” means that media containing the data should be 
disposed of through incineration or shredding of paper records and by physically destroying electronic media or deleting the 
information by overwriting the Data using techniques that make the original information non-retrievable rather than using 
standard delete or format functions.  Secure Disposal of “medium” and “high” risk data requires all copies of the Data, 
including any backups, to be destroyed.  For Data with a “low” risk classification, the disposal procedures required for higher 
risk Data can be adjusted to a more practical process providing that such processes maintain confidentiality.  For example, 
instead of destroying backups containing low risk Data, it would be sufficient to keep those backups in a secure environment 
with procedures in place that prevented unauthorised access to the Data on those backups. 
 
2) Physical and Environmental Security 
• Any unencrypted Data and products of that Data shall be stored in a physically secure 
area which will at minimum consist of: 
o  a robust security perimeter17 and properly functioning entry controls (such as 
automatic locks with card controlled entry or manned reception desk) that prevent 
entry of unaccompanied non-approved people into the secure area; and 
o A properly functioning and monitored electronic intruder detection system that 
will detect an intrusion into the secure area. 
• Data with a low to medium confidentiality classification and products of that Data that 
are encrypted as described in paragraph “5”, may be used in a non-public area outside 
the secure area described above.  When not in use, the media containing these 
encrypted Data shall be carried in person, or stored in a locked private facility and 
secured or hidden out of sight. 
• Equipment used for displaying the Data (such as monitors and printers) shall be 
located and positioned in such a manner as to prevent unauthorised viewing, recording 
or copying of the displayed information.  Printouts of the Data or products of the Data 
shall be removed from printers immediately. 
• The Data shall be Securely Disposed16 of: 
o 
for “medium” and “high” risk data, when the purpose for which the data were 
requested has been completed; 
o 
for all data, when the data are no longer required by the Organisation to serve the 
purposes of the Convention; 
o 
from any media that are scheduled for maintenance by non-Approved People and 
from any media prior to its disposal. 
 
3) Communication and Operations Management 
• Precautions shall be in place to detect and prevent the introduction of malicious code 
(such as computer viruses, Trojan horses and logic bombs) and unauthorised mobile 
code.  These precautions will at least include: 
o Installation and regular (daily or less) update of malicious code detection and 
repair software to scan computers, media and e-mails for malicious code; and 
o The Organisation shall conduct education awareness campaigns, as appropriate, on 
the dangers of malicious code and how to reduce the risk of infection by malicious 
code. 
• Appropriate network controls shall be implemented to maintain security for any Data 
that is accessible through the network. 
• Cabling carrying the Data shall be protected from interception. 
• The Data shall not be transmitted on public networks (such as the internet) unless the 
Data has been appropriately encrypted. 
• Unencrypted Data shall not be transmitted on wireless networks unless the network is 
a private encrypted network and the Data has a low confidentiality classification.  A 
computer that is connected to a wireless network may not contain Data with a medium 
or high confidentiality classification unless the Data are encrypted and the encrypted 
volume is not mounted (not active) while the computer is connected to the wireless 
network. 
• Any actual or suspected security incidents shall be investigated and reported to the 
Executive Secretary. 
                                                 
17 A ground floor office with windows would require additional protection for the windows, or physically secure internal 
enclosures for the security perimeter to be acceptable. 
 
 
4) Access Control 
• Access to the Data shall require successful logon by an Approved Person, involving a 
User ID and Password18.   
• The User ID shall be unique to the specific Approved Person. 
• The Password must be kept confidential to the Approved Person only and should be 
subject to a suitable password management policy, including: 
o Provision of any temporary passwords in a secure manner and forcing passwords 
to be changed on first log on; 
o Forcing use of minimal length and complexity of passwords; 
o Prevent re-use of passwords;  
o Advising users to use quality passwords (easy to remember without writing down, 
not based on information that is easy to guess, not vulnerable to dictionary 
attacks, free of consecutive identical or sequential characters, contain both letters 
and numbers and have an acceptable minimum length) and changing passwords 
whenever there is an indication of possible password or system compromise, and 
at regular intervals; 
o Storing, transmitting and displaying passwords in protected (e.g. encrypted) form; 
and 
o Limiting the number of unsuccessful log-on attempts to only 3 and rejecting 
further attempts without specific authorisation. 
• Accounts of Approved People shall be protected when unattended by use of a 
password protected screen saver19 that activates after less than 10 minutes of 
inactivity. 
 
5) Cryptographic Control 
• The Data shall be encrypted using robust encryption techniques whenever it is not in a 
physically secure area as described in paragraph “2” above. 
• Provision or transmission of Data by the Secretariat to data receivers or to the private 
area of the CCSBT web site20 shall use encryption techniques (encrypted files or 
encrypted transmission protocols). 
• Encryption may use either secret key techniques or public key techniques where each 
user has a public and a private key.  For both types of techniques, a wide variety of 
suitable file encryption software is available for purchase (such as PGP) or for free 
(such as TrueCrypt). 
• Encrypted volumes shall be automatically dismounted when there has been no activity 
(reading/writing to the encrypted volume) for 60 minutes, after entering a power 
saving mode, and when the user logs off. 
• Secret and private keys shall be protected from unauthorised disclosure and shall be 
distributed to intended users in a secure manner. 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
18 Other technologies for identification and authentication such as biometrics (e.g. finger-print verification) may be used. 
19 Or equivalent measure. 
20 Unless otherwise agreed by the provider of the Data, only Data with a medium confidentiality classification or less may be 
placed on the private area of the CCSBT web site.  However, Data with a medium confidentiality classification must be 
placed in a further restricted part of the private area that can only be accessed by people specifically authorised to access that 
Data.
