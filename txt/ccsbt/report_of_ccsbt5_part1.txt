Report of the Fifth Annual Meeting 
First Part 
22 – 26 February 1999 
Tokyo, Japan 
 
 
The representatives of the Governments of Australia, Japan and New Zealand convened 
the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna (CCSBT5) from 22 to 26 February 1999. 
 
Agenda Item 1: Opening of Meeting 
 
1.1 Welcoming Address 
 
The Chair welcomed delegates from Australia, Japan and New Zealand, and observers 
from the Republic of Korea, South Africa, Taiwan and the Indian Ocean Tuna 
Commission (IOTC). Mr Kagawa from Japan was identified as the observer from the 
Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). 
Mr Morishita from Japan was identified as the observer from the International 
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). 
 
1.2 Adoption of Agenda 
 
The agreed agenda and list of participants are at Attachments 1 and 2 respectively. 
 
1.3 Appointment of Rapporteurs 
 
Rapporteurs were appointed as follows: for Australia, Ms Lack and Mr Serdy, for Japan, 
Mr Morishita and Mr Kagawa, and for New Zealand, Ms Geddis and Ms Robinson. 
 
A list of documents tabled at the meeting is shown as Attachment 3. 
 
1.4 Opening Statements 
 
1.4.1 
Members 
 
Australia , Japan and New Zealand presented their opening statements (Attachments 4, 
5 and 6 respectively).  
 
1.4.2 
Other States and Entities 
 
Statements provided by the Republic of Korea, South Africa and Taiwan are at  
Attachments 7, 8 and Attachment 9 respectively. 
 
Agenda Item 2: Application by Greenpeace International to be Invited as an  
 
 
 
 
Observer at CCSBT Meetings 
 
An application by Greenpeace International to attend CCSBT5 as an observer was 
 
2
received by the Commission in advance of the meeting. Japan objected to the 
application. In accordance with Rule 3.5 of the Commission's Rules of Procedure, the 
Commission considered the objection at the meeting. New Zealand and Australia 
supported transparency in international organisations, which should include the 
provision of opportunities for representatives of non-government organisations to attend 
Commission meetings as observers. Japan maintained its objection to the application 
because of the views and past actions of Greenpeace which, in Japan's view, were 
inconsistent with the objective of the Convention. The Commission was unable to 
accept Greenpeace International's application to attend the meeting. 
 
Agenda Item 3: Report from the Secretariat 
 
The Executive Secretary presented a report that summarised the Secretariat's activities 
since the last Commission meeting (Attachment 10). The members thanked the 
Secretariat staff for its work. 
 
Agenda Item 4: Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
Ms Hamaguchi (Japan), Chair of the Standing Committee for Finance and 
Administration, presented the report from the Committee (Attachment 11). The 
Commission adopted the 1999 budget as proposed in the report, noting that it may 
require further amendment when the work plan for 1999 was finalised at CCSBT5(2).  
The Commission also adopted a procedure for submission of documents to Commission 
meetings (Annex B of the report from the Finance and Administration Committee). 
 
Agenda Item 5: Report from the Compliance Committee 
 
The Commission decided that the Compliance Committee would convene at 
CCSBT5(2), at which time it would consider New Zealand's proposal for an outline for 
members' annual compliance reports to the Committee, and a draft agenda for the 
Committee's meeting at CCSBT6 (Attachment 12). 
 
Agenda Item 6: Review of SBT Fisheries 
 
The Commission considered the annual reports reviewing SBT fisheries, as prepared by 
Australia (Attachment 13), Japan (Attachment 14), New Zealand (Attachment 15), 
the Republic of Korea (Attachment 16), and Taiwan (Attachment 17). 
 
Agenda Item 7: Relationship with Non-Members 
 
7.1  The Republic of Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan 
 
The Commission continued to be concerned with the level of SBT catch outside the 
Commission and recent significant increases of catch by some non-members. Such 
catch had, in the Commission's opinion, the potential to jeopardise the recovery of the 
stock and the viability of the SBT fishery. The Commission held the strong view that, in 
order to effectively manage SBT, all States and entities which fish for SBT should, as 
soon as possible, take steps to join or cooperate with the Commission. 
 
3
 
The Commission reminded non-members of their responsibilities under international 
agreements and instruments including UNCLOS, UNIA and the FAO Code of Conduct 
in particular: 
 
• 
the requirement to cooperate with appropriate regional fishery management 
 
organisations,  
 
• 
the restriction of access to the relevant fishery to States and entities applying the 
 
measures established by such organisations, and  
 
• 
the requirement that States and entities not applying those measures, not authorise 
 
vessels flying their flags to engage in fishing operations for the relevant stock. 
 
The Commission developed letters to forward to Korea and Taiwan (Attachments 18 
and 19 respectively) requesting them to join or cooperate with the Commission and 
informing them of its readiness to discuss an appropriate quota with them at CCSBT5 
(2). Australia undertook to prepare a proposal to facilitate Indonesia's accession for the 
Commission's consideration at CCSBT5(2). 
 
7.2 Other Non Members 
 
The Commission expressed grave concern about the increase of flag of convenience 
(FOC) fishing activities undertaken in an attempt to avoid compliance with the 
conservation and management efforts of regional fisheries management organisations.  
The Commission adopted a resolution directed at eliminating FOC fishing activities 
(Attachment 20). Japan tabled a list of FOC fishing vessels compiled using trade 
information. Taiwan stated that it would make every effort to repatriate FOC fishing 
vessels built in Taiwan. 
 
The Commission welcomed Japan's decision to reduce its distant water tuna longline 
fleet by 20% and adopted a resolution (Attachment 21) requesting other distant water 
fishing nations and entities operating substantial longline fleets within the range of SBT 
to take concerted action to reduce their fleet capacity. 
 
Agenda Item 8: Report from the Trade Information Scheme Workshop 
 
The Commission accepted the report from the Trade Information Workshop 
(CCSBT/9902/Rep.2) and recognised the importance of a trade certification scheme to 
collect more accurate and comprehensive information on SBT fishing activities. 
 
In order to consider and progress trade certification as a matter of urgency, members 
undertook to provide comments on the Australian proposal (CCSBT/9902/11), based on 
the ICCAT Trade Certification Scheme, by CCSBT5(2). 
 
The Commission decided to convene a workshop in July for the purpose of considering 
and progressing a Trade Certification Scheme for SBT. 
 
 
4
Australia and New Zealand reported that their SBT fishing industries had offered to 
participate in a voluntary trial Trade Certificate Scheme. Further discussion would take 
place with Japan on the storage and use of information provided under the voluntary 
scheme. 
 
The Commission approved a letter to non-members to signal that the Commission is 
considering the establishment of a trade certification scheme (Attachment 22). 
 
Agenda Item 9: Relationship with Other Organisations 
 
9.1 Reports from Meetings of Relevant Fisheries Management Organisations 
 
The Commission thanked the Secretariat for the reports it prepared following its 
attendance at recent meetings of CCAMLR (Attachment 23) and IOTC (Attachment 
24) and suggested that future reports include a section highlighting potential 
implications for the Commission. 
 
9.2 CITES 
 
Japan reported the decision of COFI to review criteria for listing of marine species 
under the appendices to CITES and asked for Australia's view on the proposal from 
Australian environmental groups to list SBT on Appendix II to CITES. Australia replied 
that the matter was still under consideration by its Government under procedures 
required by Australian law, which would include consultation with relevant bodies.  
Australia's decision, expected in either May or September 1999, would be immediately 
advised to the Commission and its members. 
 
9.3 Relevant Organisations and International Instruments 
 
Members acknowledged the Secretariat's work in developing its paper 
(CCSBT/9902/13) and undertook to provide preliminary comments on the paper at 
CCSBT5(2). 
 
9.4 Meeting of FAO and Non-FAO Regional Fishery Bodies 
 
The Executive Secretary presented a paper summarising the key outcomes from the 
recent meeting of FAO and non-FAO Regional Fisheries Bodies (CCSBT/9902/14). In 
addition, he advised that a significant theme of the meeting relevant to the CCSBT was 
the collection and exchange of data. FAO representatives had advised the meeting that 
there were major gaps in global fisheries information and increased involvement of 
regional fishery bodies in collating and verifying data was seen as an important step in 
improving global data collection. Informal discussions among representatives of tuna 
commissions highlighted the need for close cooperation among those bodies. It was 
noted that IATTC would develop proposals to improve coordination among them. The 
Commission welcomed these developments as a positive initiative. 
 
 
 
 
5
9.5 IGO's Attendance at the Scientific Committee Meetings 
 
Japan undertook to provide comments on the draft procedure circulated by the 
Secretariat (CCSBT/9902/15). 
 
Agenda Item 10: Scientific Committee 
 
10.1  Report from the Scientific Committee 
 
The Commission accepted the report from the Fourth Meeting of the Scientific 
Committee (CCSBT/9902/Rep.4) and thanked the Chair and delegations of that 
meeting for their efforts. Statements on the report were provided by Australia 
(Attachment 25), Japan (Attachment 26) and New Zealand (Attachment 27). 
 
The Commission decided to give further consideration to the recommendations of the 
Scientific Committee at CCSBT5(2). Australia tabled a paper summarising the 
recommendations of the 1998 Scientific Committee report (Attachment 28) to be 
considered at CCSBT5(2). 
 
Japan proposed that the Scientific Committee analyse the effect of increasing fishing 
mortality of juvenile SBT on recruitment to the parental biomass. Australia undertook to 
consider further this proposal and respond at CCSBT5(2). 
 
10.2 Report from the Ecologically Related Species Working Group (ERSWG) 
 
The Commission accepted the report from the third meeting of the ERSWG 
(CCSBT/9902/Rep.1) and thanked the Chair, and the delegations, of that meeting for 
their efforts. The Commission adopted a series of recommendations relating to 
ecologically related species (Attachment 29), guidelines for the design and 
implementation of tori lines (Attachment 30) and a draft agenda for the fourth meeting 
of the working group (Attachment 31). 
 
The Commission requested that non-members adopt, as a matter of urgency, measures 
to reduce incidental take of seabirds. Those measures should be in accordance with the 
measures adopted by the CCSBT and the FAO International Plan of Action for Seabirds.  
The Commission also invited non-members to send scientists to participate in meetings 
of the ERSWG. 
 
Japan tabled a document on the abundance of cetaceans and their estimated food 
consumption in the breeding ground of SBT. The Commission determined that the issue 
would be best considered by the ERSWG. 
 
10.3 Rules of Procedure for the Scientific Committee 
 
The Commission recognised the importance of finalising the Rules of Procedure for the 
Scientific Committee, and decided to include this matter in the review of the scientific 
process that would be undertaken by the Commission in response to the report from the 
Peer Review Panel. 
 
6
 
Agenda Item 11: Peer Review of Scientific Committee's Stock Assessment Process 
 
The Commission noted the report from the Peer Review Panel that reviewed the 
scientific process in 1998 (CCSBT/9902/17) and thanked the peer review scientists, Drs 
Maguire, Sullivan and Tanaka, for their efforts. The Commission acknowledged that the 
report contained many useful recommendations and decided to convene a working 
group to consider the recommendations from the review. Terms of Reference for the 
working group are at Attachment 32. 
 
Agenda Item 12: Arrangements for Data Management 
 
The Commission recognised the potential role of the Secretariat in managing a database, 
and decided to consider the issue further at CCSBT5(2), where Australia would provide 
a paper for discussion. 
 
Agenda Item 13: Total Allowable Catch and its Allocation 
 
Japan proposed increasing the TAC by 3 000 tonnes or more and referred to the high 
probability of stock recovery (more than 60%) using the Japanese VPA analysis with 
both the Japanese and Australian weightings. Japan reported that its TAC proposal was 
supported by the results of its 1998 EFP which indicated a 70% probability of  
recovery when the Japanese VPA analysis was used. 
 
New Zealand stated its ongoing concern about the current status of the stock and urged 
the Commission to take steps to improve the probability of stock rebuild. New Zealand 
considered that this objective would not be achieved unless steps were taken to restrain 
and potentially reduce overall catch. 
 
Australia considered that the strength of the Commission as the primary management 
organisation for SBT was derived ultimately from its ability to set a TAC as a 
management tool. The appropriate level for the TAC in 1998-99 should continue to be 
11 750 tonnes, with national allocations unchanged from those most recently decided by 
the Commission. 
 
New Zealand and Australia suggested that the Commission consider establishing a 
three-year cycle for setting the TAC, with an annual scientific programme. They 
considered that such an arrangement would enable the Commission to redirect resources 
to resolving both scientific and management issues. 
 
The Commission decided to defer discussion on this matter until CCSBT5(2). The 
members noted that the report from the EFPWG would be a relevant consideration. 
 
Agenda Item 14: Experimental Fishing Program 
 
Japan provided a summary of the results from the experimental fishing programme it 
undertook in 1998 (Attachment 33). The Commission noted that a dispute settlement 
process over that programme had been initiated under Article 16.1 of the Convention.  
 
7
The members stated that their legal positions remained unchanged from those presented 
in the December 1998 dispute settlement negotiations. The members noted that a 
Working Group to develop a joint EFP had been established. 
 
Agenda Item 15: Future Quota Allocation Mechanism 
 
The Commission did not reach consensus on Japan's proposal held over from CCSBT3. 
 
Agenda Item 16: Confidentiality of Commission Documents 
 
The Commission decided to defer further consideration of this matter to CCSBT6. 
 
Agenda Item 17: Program of Work for 1998-99 
 
The Commission developed a draft programme of work for 1999 (Attachment 34), that 
would be reviewed at CCSBT5(2). 
 
Agenda Item 18: Other Business 
 
The Executive Secretary reported that the Australian Government had advised, in 
accordance with Article 27(1) of the Commission's Headquarters Agreement with 
Australia, that it had completed all domestic requirements for entry into force of the 
Agreement (CCSBT/9902/21-Attachment 1). The Commission adopted a resolution 
(Attachment 35) authorising the Executive Secretary to complete the exchange of 
letters necessary to bring the Agreement into force. 
 
Agenda Item 19: Close of the Meeting 
 
It was decided to adjourn the meeting and reconvene on 10 May 1999.

Australian Opening Statement - CCSBT5 
22 February 1999, Tokyo 
 
Mr Chairman, 
 
It is an honour for me to make this opening statement on behalf of the Australian 
delegation. 
 
I have just taken responsibility, as Director General, for our Department's Fisheries and 
Forestry Industries Division. 
 
I wanted to come to this meeting to support my colleague, Mr Hurry, who has principal 
day to day policy responsibility for fisheries and aquaculture, and my other colleagues 
on the delegation, to reinforce the fundamental commitment Australia has to the 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. We see this as the principal 
cooperative mechanism, through appropriate management, for the conservation and 
optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna. 
 
It was with regret that Australia was not able to attend the meeting of the Commission 
scheduled for October 1998. The import of the issues dealt with by the Commission 
meant that we could not settle upon an Australian position for the meeting at that time, 
with the Australian Government in a caretaker mode and not making policy decisions in 
the lead up to the national election. 
 
But we want to leave other Parties in no doubt about the Australian Government's intent.  
We want to build on the Commission's past successes and further invigorate it for the 
future. Through the course of this meeting we will be making practical suggestions and 
proposals on a number of issues to demonstrate this intent. 
 
Australia senses a renewed, positive spirit of cooperation and we want to maintain and 
build on this momentum. As we see it, we all need to translate this positive spirit into 
significant, positive and concrete actions. They have to have practical effect. We will all 
need to be flexible, be prepared to move and amend our stances on some issues in order 
to achieve mutually acceptable outcomes which are in the long term interests of the 
conservation, management and optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna. 
 
Nowhere will this be more important than in the efforts of the Experimental Fishing 
Program Working Group. You will recall, Mr Chairman, that we are in dispute over 
Japan's action in conducting a unilateral EFP in 1998. While the dispute per se is 
unresolved at this time, we have agreed on a course of action to move matters forward 
by looking to develop a future joint EFP. Australia is working in good faith to this end.  
In taking this crucial matter forward, Australia is strongly committed to ensuring a 
possible future joint EFP is scientifically rigorous and credible. 
 
We do not, in any sense, want to see the EFP working group process fail to provide the 
Commission with an acceptable basis for conducting an agreed EFP in the future.  
However, if the process did fail, and should that lead to a member of the Commission 
conducting a future EFP unilaterally, we would see that as contrary to international law 
and it would seriously exacerbate the present dispute. 
 
Mr Chairman, there are a number of other key issues on the agenda for our deliberations, 
particularly our relationship with non-members of the Commission, a trade information 
scheme and the outcomes and implementation of the Peer Review process which are 
very important and, as a package, together with the progress we are seeking on a 
possible future EFP, are very much linked to the further building and invigoration of the 
Commission. 
 
In summary, Australia is looking forward to building on what we believe is currently a 
positive spirit, to translate that into practical and tangible decisions and actions which 
advance our fundamental and mutually agreed objective, which is to ensure through 
appropriate management the conservation and optimum utilisation of southern bluefin 
tuna. 
 
Attachment 5 
 
Opening Statement by Japan 
at the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Commission 
 
 
Mr Chairman, Delegates of Member Countries, Observers. 
 
On behalf of the Japanese delegation, I would like to say a few words at the outset of 
the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna. 
 
The CCSBT was established in 1994 to ensure proper management and effective 
utilization of SBT stock. The CCSBT has conducted substantial discussions to date.  
However, it is disappointing that TAC and its national allocation have not been able to 
determined because of the different views on the stock assessment between the Parties 
as it was the same situation at the Forth Annual Meeting of the Commission. 
 
However, this does not mean that the CCSBT has been inactive to date. On the contrary, 
we have made some headway in such areas as non-member catch issue, trade 
information scheme, and ecologically related species working group, thanks to 
cooperative spirit among the Parties. The effort has also been made to develop the joint 
EFP. It is unfortunate that the Parties did not reach consensus on joint EFP and Japan 
conducted EFP last year at its own responsibility. The outcome of the EFP was reported 
to other Parties and is on the agenda of the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Commission. 
 
At the CCSBT5, we will discuss 1999 budget, non-member catches, trade information 
scheme, TAC and national allocations, EFP, relationship with other international bodies, 
work plan for 1998-99. Japan's position on each subject will be given under the 
appropriate item. For now, I will express the basic position of Japanese government 
toward the CCSBT. It is Japan's understanding that the CCSBT Parties are urgently 
required to build mutual trust and cooperation for rational conservation and 
management of SBT as well as its effective utilization based on scientific information.  
These are pointed out at the last year's Scientific Committee Peer Review Panel Report.  
I would like to take this opportunity to express Japan's appreciation to three external 
scientists, Dr Sullivan., Mr Maguire and Dr Tanaka for their excellent work. 
 
This meeting has observers of Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Africa. They are the 
nations and entity we wish for their accession to or cooperation with the CCSBT as 
fishing and/or coastal states and entity. To do this, the CCSBT needs to fulfill its 
function as a regional fishery management organization and establish the credibility 
internationally. This will require mutual cooperation and trust so that the CCSBT will 
work constructively on specific issues. 
 
When we met in December last year for the Article 16 negotiation, the Parties agreed to 
develop consensus on joint EFP and have it approved by the Commission by the end of 
April this year. The Parties also agreed to hold a workshop to consider implementation 
of the Peer Review Panel recommendations. In parallel to the Commission meeting, the 
second EFP meeting will begin on 25 February. The parties are making the first step 
forward in building mutual trust and cooperation. Japan is looking forward to making 
further contribution to the CCSBT. 
 
Finally, members of delegations, observers, CCSBT Secretariat staff, I would like to 
welcome you all again on behalf of the hosting nation and at the same time I look 
forward to many fruitful outcomes. This is the coldest time of the year in Japan, so 
please take care not to catch a cold and enjoy Japanese winter. 
 
Thank you. 
 
Attachment 6 
 
New Zealand Opening Statement - CCSBT 5 
 
 
The New Zealand delegation is pleased to be in Tokyo to renew our working 
relationship with the Japanese and Australian delegations, and Secretariat staff. We also 
welcome the involvement representatives from Korea, Taiwan and South Africa.  We 
look forward to meeting with the renewed spirit of cooperation an understanding we 
enjoyed in December. 
 
The members are in Tokyo because of our joint commitment to the sustainable 
utilisation of southern bluefin tuna. New Zealand is firmly of the view this objective 
will only be achieved through the improved function of the Commission we jointly 
established. However, there are challenges before us. The New Zealand delegation is 
prepared to make every effort to resolve difficulties and play its part in building a 
consensus between the parties. We recognise this will involve efforts to understand all 
positions and a willingness to accommodate differing views in reaching acceptable 
outcomes. 
 
We retain our concern for a stock with a parental biomass at historically low levels, 
evidence of declining recruitment in recent years, and increasing fishing pressure. NZ 
will advocate urgent steps to improve the probability of stock rebuild. This will not be 
achieved unless overall removals of SBT are constrained and potentially reduced. We 
believe the Commission's decisions on the TAC, non-members and trade certification 
are the keys to achieving this objective. 
 
During the first four months of this year the Commission is proposing to discuss and 
make decisions on a number of issues crucial to the viability and function of the 
Commission. For NZ's part, we look forward to working cooperatively with other 
parties to develop a programme to make concurrent progress on all of these issues. 
 
As recognised by all parties, restraint of non-members catch would clearly contribute to 
an improved potential for stock rebuild. It would also recognise the efforts already made 
by members of the Commission over the last two decades to develop a management 
framework and constrain their respective catch levels. CCSBT5 needs to hastily develop 
and agree on a process to achieve the accession or cooperation of non-members. We 
also expect to make progress on agreeing a programme for the early implementation of 
an SBT trade information scheme. 
 
The peer review report provides a useful basis for considering how we might improve 
the current scientific process and has the potential to achieve a greater level of 
consensus in scientific advice. Such a consensus, along with a clear management 
framework developed by the Commission, would substantially improve the function and 
effectiveness of the Commission. It is our hope that CCSBT5 will identify and establish 
a process to implement those parts of the report we can quickly agree. 
 
 
NZ is mindful of the current legal dispute between parties, but recognising the process 
agreed at the December meeting, we believe that the focus of this meeting should be to 
ensure that substantive progress is made on other issues. One of these issues is the 
development of an experimental fishing programme that will be considered by the 
EFPWG following CCSBT5. NZ looks forward to participating in the design of an EFP 
that will resolve current uncertainty in the assessment to the satisfaction of all parties, 
while not compromising rebuilding of the stock. 
 
We have an ambitious agenda before us over the next five days, but given the current 
position of the Commission, only a few of those issues are of key importance. We would 
encourage the Chair to guide the meeting to outcomes on those substantive issues, while 
concluding expeditiously a number of more administrative issues. 
Given good will and flexibility on all sides, we hope that we can make good progress on 
the key issues before us, and set a positive platform for the resumption of the EFPWG 
later in the week. 
 
We look forward to, and undertake to play our part, in a positive and constructive 
atmosphere for this meeting to achieve outcomes that are acceptable to all parties. 
 
Thank you 
 
Attachment 7 
 
Opening Statement by Korea 
 
On behalf of Korean government, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr. 
chairman and distinguished delegations of CCSBT member states, for inviting Korean 
delegation to this meaningful conference as observers. Also my delegation's special 
greetings go to every observers from non- member states and related international 
organizations. 
 
Korean government believes that CCSBT, since its establishment in 1994, has played 
very significant role for effective utilization and conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. 
Especially, it appreciates very much CCSBT's effort for amicable and positive dialogue 
with non-members. 
 
Nevertheless, Korea is seriously concerned about recent discord among member states 
over the function of the organization and about the dispute with other tuna organization 
on territorial jurisdiction. It is because that such instability of the organization might 
exert any influence upon Korea's consideration to accede to it. 
 
However, what is hindering Korea's most above all is CCSBT's insufficient offer of 
quota for Korea which is far from the present fishing reality of Korean SBT industry. 
Korea has sought the way to be a member of CCSBT industry. Korea has sought the 
way to be a member of CCSBT in an earlier stage, but unfortunately it has not reached 
any affirmative conclusion yet in spite of number of rounds of inter ministerial meetings 
and government-industry consultations. 
 
As explained through several channels, strong concerns are dominant in Korean SBT 
industry that it will be no longer able to continue its fishing activities with annual quota 
of 550MT which CCSBT offered to Korea on the condition of accession. Of course 
Korean government is not in the position to tell the relevant industries to totally suspend 
their businesses. 
 
Therefore, I sincerely request that distinguished delegates of CCSBT here take account 
of the difficulties that Korean industry faces with, and reconsider to allocate more 
practical fishing quota for Korea, that is, at least twofold as much as recently CCSBT 
suggested, in view of current number of fishing vessels and catch results. 
 
It is my government's basic policy that Korea, as a responsible fishing state, will 
continue to closely cooperate with CCSBT as ever even before it join the organization, 
for appropriate conservation and management of Southern Bluefin Tuna. In this context, 
I would like to say that Korea is willing to participate in the Experimental Fishing 
Program which will be implemented through the consensus of all member states. 
 
Finally, I hope that this conference will be a forum for enhancing cooperation between 
member states and non-members producing a fruitful outcome.  
Thank you.  
Attachment 8 
 
Opening Statement by South Africa 
 
 
On behalf of the South African Government I wish to thank the Commission for 
allowing me to attend the Fifth Annual Meeting in Tokyo. South Africa has a keen 
interest in the effective management and sustainable utilisation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna, and with the establishment of a domestic large pelagic fishery, SBT may become 
a significant component of the catch. 
 
The South African tuna fishery has consisted mainly of pole and line operations, 
directed at albacore Thunnus alalunga. There have been occasional landings of SBT in 
this fishery, but always less than one ton dressed weight per year for the last ten years. 
 
In 1997, South Africa initiated a new experimental longline fishery for tuna, with 30 
permits allocated, of which approximately half have been activated to date. Current 
records indicate that 756 kg of SBT was landed by the domestic longline fleet. The fleet 
is not targeting SBT, but other tuna and billfish. 
 
Japan and Taiwan report catches of SBT from the South Africa EEZ. The mean reported 
catch from Japan is 34 ton for 1990-1998. Taiwan reported 14 ton for 1997 and 3 ton for 
the first six months of 1998. 
 
South Africa is eager to participate in the discussions of the CCSBT, and would like to 
maintain our observer status at future meetings of the Commission. South Africa may 
however wish to change this status in the future. 
 
Thank you. 
 
Attachment 9 
 
Opening Statement from Taiwan 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for giving us the floor. On behalf of my country, I 
would like to express our gratitude to the CCSBT Secretariat and contracting parties for 
inviting my government to be represented in this meeting. 
 
We well understand that CCSBT has dedicated to managing southern bluefin tuna from 
the past. We appreciate its efforts very much. As a deep sea fishing nation, although we 
are not the member of CCSBT, we deeply believe it's our obligation to cooperate with 
CCSBT member countries for the purpose of making sustainable management on the 
resource. Therefore, we have stipulated the regulation to impose the catch self-restraint 
since 1996. I would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to our such 
efforts, in particular, as compared to other non-members. In order to execute such catch 
restraint, boat owners fishing SBT were required to provide catch reports to fishery 
authorities on a weekly basis. Meanwhile, fishermen are encouraged to use friendly gear 
to reduce seabird captures in longline operations. Besides, we have dispatched our 
scientists to join the scientific activities of CCSBT and are willing to collaboratively 
provide catch and effort data to CCSBT for scientific purpose. 
 
Mr. Chairman, obligation and right should be closely linked together. While performing 
obligation, we should have equal right as the same with other fishing nations. I would 
like to reiterate that Taiwan is very willing to cooperate with other countries for the 
conservation and management of marine living resources. Thus, we seek the accession 
to become a full member of CCSBT. We wish CCSBT to take this issue into 
consideration and put into action. 
 
We look forward to having a productive week during which we can resolve substantial 
issues and reach fruitful results. Finally, we appreciate very much for the wonderful 
preparation and hospitality by the hosting country, Japan. 
 
Thank you.

Representatives from the member countries and the Executive Secretary met with 
 
representatives from the Republic of Korea and Taiwan in April 1998 in 
 
accordance with the Action Plan Concerning Promotion of Accession to and 
 
Cooperation with, CCSBT by Non-member States and Entities. Korean and 
 
Taiwanese representatives indicated a desire to cooperate in the conservation and 
 
management of SBT and undertook to consider matters proposed in the Action 
 
Plan. The meetings provided an opportunity for an open exchange of views on the 
 
SBT fishery and a firm basis for improving cooperation in the conservation and 
 
management of SBT. Discussions still need to be held with representatives from 
 
Indonesia at a mutually convenient time. Issues to be followed up from the 
 
meetings have been scheduled for further consideration at the Fifth Annual 
 
Meeting of the Commission. 
 
4. 
The Headquarters Agreement between the Commission and the Government of 
 
Australia was signed and incorporated into the 1998 update of CCSBT Basic 
 
Documents and distributed to members. In addition, the Government of Australia 
 
provided the Commission a Note proposing an agreed interpretation of Article 20 
 
relating to Australia's migration laws. The reply by the Executive Secretary 
 
agreeing to the proposed interpretation, was sent to the Australian Department of 
 
Foreign Affairs and Trade on 29 January 1998.  
 
5. 
In accordance with the decision of the Fourth Annual Meeting (second part) of the 
 
Commission, the Secretariat facilitated the selection of the review panel and made 
 
the necessary administrative arrangements for the undertaking of a peer review of 
 
the Scientific Assessment Process. Review panel members attended the meetings of 
 
the Stock Assessment Group and the Scientific Committee and submitted their 
 
report to the Secretariat following further discussions with participants at the 
 
Scientific Committee subsequent to the Scientific Committee meeting. The report 
 
has been circulated to members of the Commission for consideration at the Fifth 
 
Annual Meeting (CCSBT/9902/17). 
 
6. 
The Secretariat has been undertaking the translation into Japanese and distribution 
 
to members for formal adoption, the reports of meetings of the Commission and its 
 
subsidiary bodies, in accordance with the decision of the Fourth Annual Meeting of 
 
the Commission (first part). The status of the translations is set out in  
 
CCSBT/9902/6. 
 
7. 
In accordance with advice received from members, the Secretariat informed the 
 
Fisheries Department FAO in March 1998 that the CCSBT supported in principle 
 
the co-sponsoring of an Expert Consultation on Implications of the Precautionary 
 
Approach for Tuna Biological and Technological Research, however no 
 
commitment was given at that time to any financial contribution to the program. 
 
The CCSBT is represented on the Steering Committee established to oversight the 
 
consultancy together with representatives from other international organisations 
 
with responsibilities for managing migratory tuna stocks. The Secretariat is 
 
currently the point of contact for the work of the Steering Committee. The 
 
Secretariat liaises with the scientific representatives of members to develop any 
 
CCSBT input to the Steering Committee. 
 
8. 
The Executive Secretary attended the Meeting of FAO and Non-FAO Regional 
 
Fishery Bodies held in Rome on 11 and 12 February 1999 sponsored by FAO 
 
(CCSBT/9902/14).  
 
9. 
As requested by the Fourth Annual Meeting (First Part), the Secretariat prepared a 
 
paper on the comparison of the relevant provisions of the Convention for the 
 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and the UN Agreement on Straddling Fish 
 
Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and distributed to members for comments 
 
in preparation for further discussion at the Fifth Annual meeting of the 
 
Commission (CCSBT/9902/13). A number of areas was identified where several 
 
options for action are available. 
 
10. Financial Statements for 1997 were cleared by the Auditor and Audit 
 
recommendations implemented. Copies of the audited statements were circulated to 
 
members in May 1998. 
 
11. As agreed at the Fourth Annual Meeting (second part), a letter seeking membership 
 
of the FAO Coordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics (CWP) was sent on 
 
28 February 1998. On 14 July 1998, the advice was received that the CCSBT had 
 
been accepted as a member of the CWP and a CCSBT representative has been 
 
invited to the next meeting of the CWP from 6-9 July 1999 in Luxembourg. 
 
12. In October 1997 Amendments were made to the Australian International 
 
Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963, to provide for an exemption 
 
from sales tax for prescribed international organisations and for the refund of sales 
 
tax already paid. Regulations have been made for this purpose for the CCSBT and 
 
the amount of $7,511.91 was refunded to the CCSBT by the Australian Taxation 
 
Office in 1998.

Annual Review of Australia's Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery 
 
 
1. 
Introduction 
The Australian domestic SBT preliminary catch during the 1997/98 season was 5087 
tonnes. The season commenced on 1 December 1997 and ceased on 30 November 1998. 
There were no bilateral-licensed Japanese vessels fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone 
during the 1997/98 season. 
 
2. 
Operational Constraints on Effort 
Regulatory Measures 
Domestic operators are managed through individual transferable quotas (ITQs) granted 
as Statutory Fishing Rights (SFRs) under the Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery 
Management Plan 1995.  
Although the global total allowable catch (TAC) was not determined by the 
Commission for the 1997/98 season, Australia agreed to maintain its national catch limit 
at 5265 tonnes, which has remained unchanged since 1989/90. 
 
3. 
Catch and Effort 
Preliminary SBT landings for the 1997/98 season were: 
South Australia 
 
 
4402 tonnes 
(and Western Australia)  
(3487 t purse-seined and placed in farm cages and 915 t 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
poled or longlined and fresh chilled) 
Tasmania 
 
 
 
297 tonnes 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(294 t longlined and 3 t trolled) 
New South Wales  
 
388 tonnes 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(354 t longlined and 34 t poled and purse seined). 
SBT caught for fish farms in South Australia, using primarily purse seine vessels with 
assistance from poling vessels, continue to account for a large proportion (around 70%) 
of the Australian catch. The domestic longlining component rose from 10% in 1996/97 
to 13% in 1997/98, while the pole and purse seine catches for the fresh chilled market 
fell from 40% to 18.5%. 
 
4. 
Historical Catch and Effort 
Major restructuring occurred in Australia's SBT fisheries following reductions in the 
global TAC and national catch allocations in the late 1980s. 
Attachment A summarises the catch taken by each sector of the Australian industry 
since 1988/89. 
 
5. 
Annual Fleet Size and Distribution 
Fishing for SBT in South Australia, both in the fresh-chilled and the farm components, 
commenced in December 1997 and continued until around April 1998. Eleven vessels, 
mainly pole and purse seine, operated during this period. 
Longline fishing off New South Wales commenced in June 1998 and continued until 
September. Fifty-four longline vessels reported taking SBT catches from these waters. 
There were some purse-seine sets made in June and July 1998, however, catches were 
low. 
Ten longline and four troll vessels operated off Tasmania during the 1997/98 season. 
Late in the season two domestic longliners targeted SBT in waters off Western 
Australia. 
 
6. 
Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
Australians began fishing for SBT in the early 1950s off New South Wales, South 
Australia then later (1970), Western Australia. The Australian catch peaked at 21,500 
tonnes in 1982. Historically, the bulk of the Australian catch had been used for canning. 
The introduction of an ITQ based management plan in 1984 based on an Australian 
TAC of 14,500 tonnes resulted in the redistribution of quota ownership. Progressively 
over the mid to late 1980s, the Australian catch focussed on supplying the Japanese 
sashimi market, with an increasing amount of the catch being transhipped to Japanese 
freezer vessels in the Great Australian Bight. 
In the late 1980s the Australian quota reductions to 5265 tonnes led to further 
restructuring. From 1990 to 1994 approximately half the Australian quota was taken by 
Australia-Japan joint venture longliners. With the termination of the joint venture 
arrangement in 1995 Australian catches again focused on the surface fishery with pole 
operations supplying the fresh chilled sashimi market and an increasing farm 
component. 
There has been a progressive increase since 1992 in the quantity of SBT taken for 
farming operations. In the 1998/99 season, the farm component is expected to be in the 
order of 4450 tonnes or 84% of the Australian catch. 
 
7. 
Fisheries Monitoring 
As a result of a review of the monitoring arrangements, significant changes have been 
implemented to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the SBT monitoring 
program. These include the creation of new catch disposal records; one specifically 
designed to cater for farm operations. 
Farm Monitoring Procedures were reviewed and several requirements were put into 
legislation to improve their effectiveness. Boat inspections while in port and the 
monitoring of all transfers of fish to farm cages continued in 1997/98. 
 
8. 
Other factors 
Import/Export Statistics 
Australia is currently looking to upgrade its recording of SBT exports to enable 
comparisons with Japanese import statistics. 
Markets 
More than 95% of Australia's SBT catch is exported to Japan. 
Mitigation 
To reduce the incidental take of seabirds, Australian regulations require that all longline 
vessels operating in the Australian Fishing Zone south of 30º S use tori-poles. A Threat 
Abatement Plan on the "incidental catch (or bycatch) of seabirds during oceanic 
longline fishing operations" was released by the Minister for the Environment in August 
1998. Regulations for the implementation of mitigation measures are being developed. 
A pilot observer program is being designed as a measure to monitor seabird bycatch 
rates in the domestic longline fishery.

Review of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) Fisheries in Japan 
(1998/97 season) 
 
 
1. 
Outline 
(1) The Government of Japan (GOJ) (a)establishes annual total catch limit, (b) 
establishes the operation period respectively for three divided fishing area , (c) requires 
fishing vessels to report on their catches and vessel position to the government, and (d) 
takes measures necessary for controlling and regulating fisheries, including dispatching 
of patrol boats, boarding of observers on fishing vessels, in order to ensure responsible 
fishing operation. 
 
(2) Under the control of GOJ, catch limit, number of fishing vessels operating, and the 
starting date of fishing are established on an area-to-area through arrangements by the 
fisheries industry. 
 
2. 
Catch control 
 
In the 1997 and 1998 fishing seasons, the following catch control measures were 
taken: 
 
(1) Governmental control 
 
GOJ establishes closed season for each fishing ground through government notice 
for the purpose of protecting spawning and juvenile fishes. Further, GOJ requires 
fishing vessels operating in the SBT fishing ground, through government notice, to 
report the day of entry in, and departure from, fishing ground within 3 days of entry or 
departure, and report on catches at an interval of 10 days. GOJ also requires fishing 
vessels, through administrative guidance, to report on daily catch data (RTMP), 
including biological data (e.g. fish size) and oceanographic data, as well as on vessels 
position by means of VMS on a daily basis. GOJ controls catch limit on the basis of 
these data, and calculate the date on which catch limit are attained on an area-to-area 
basis, and, through government notice, prohibits operation after the closing date. 
 
(2) Control by industry organizations 
 
Fisheries industry made area-to-area arrangements on planned catch limit, starting 
date of fishing operation and selected fishing vessels which can be engaged in fisheries. 
 
3. Catch quantities and fishing effort(See Appendix 1) 
4. Past catch quantities and fishing effort(See Appendix 1) 
 
1) 
1997 fishing season 
 
In 1996, 40 vessels engaging in fishing in violation of the domestic regulation in 
the high seas in southern Indian Ocean were found. As a result, in the 1997 fishing 
season, it placed under its control a total of 5,757 tons of SBT (i.e. 6,065 tons minus 308 
tons(excessive catch in 1996)) as catch limit. 
 
 
Distant-water tuna longline fishing vessels targeting at SBT in that year numbered 
257. Of them, 217 actually operated, with the catch of 5,588 tons. 
 
2) 
1998 fishing season 
 
GOJ took a voluntary measure to manage 6,065 tons as catch limit, in the absence 
of an decision on national allocation at the Commission on the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT). 
 
 
Distant-water tuna longline fishing vessels targeting at SBT numbered 257 in 1998. 
Of them, 221 actually operated, with the catch of 6,038 tons. 
In the 1998 fishing season, experimental fishing was conducted as in the following, in 
addition to ordinary commercial catch. 
 
- fishing ground: high seas in southern Indian Ocean 
 
- operation period: July 10-August 31 
 
- number of fishing vessels operating: 65 
 
- planned catch quantities: 1,400 tons 
 
- actual catch: 1,464 tons

6. 
Past fishing vessels scale and distribution of vessel types 
 
 
As shown in Appendix 2, the vessel scale of Japanese SBT fishing vessels are 
distributed extensively, ranging from 199-ton type to 499-ton type. Gross vessel scale 
stayed at 78,856 tons (1998 fishing season), and the major type of fishing vessels was 
379-ton type. In recent years, there have been no substantial changes in the range of 
distribution, gross scale of fishing vessels and the type of major fishing vessels. 
 
7. 
Monitoring 
(1) Dispatching of enforcement vessels 
 
In 1997 (March 1.1997-February 28.1998), Japan dispatched 5 enforcement vessels 
for a total of 453 days to the three areas of off Tasmania, southern Indian Ocean and the 
area off Cape Town. 
 
 
In the 1998 (March 1, 1998-February 28, 1998), Japan dispatched 5 enforcement 
vessels for a total of 589 days to the three areas of off Tasmania, southern Indian Ocean 
and off Cape Town. 
 
(2) Boarding of observers 
(i) In the 1997 fishing season, observers boarded a total of 15 vessels for a total of 
1,050 days: 3 vessels in the high seas off Tasmania/Sydney, 4 vessels in the high seas 
off Cape Town, and 8 vessels in the high seas in southern Indian Ocean. While the 
number of vessels boarded was unchanged from the previous year, the number of 
boarding days increased slightly (869 days in 1996). 
 
(ii) In the 1998 fishing season, observers boarded a total of 10 vessels for a total of 704 
days: 2 vessels in the high seas off Tasmania/Sydney, 4 vessels in the high seas off Cape 
Town, and 4 vessels in the high seas in southern Indian Ocean. The total number of 
boarding days decreased because several observers boarded experimented fishing 
vessels in stead of commercial vessels. 
 
(iii) In the experimental fishing conducted in the 1998 fishing season, 15 observers, 
including 3 foreign (U.S.) observers, boarded for a total of 829 days on 15 out of the 65 
vessels participating in the experimental fishing. 
 
8. 
Others 
(1) Exports and imports 
(i) Imports 
 
As shown in Appendix 3, the import of SBT to Japan in 1997 aggregated 8,059 
tons, which was an increase of 38% over the preceding year. Major exporters were 
Australia, Taiwan and the Republic of Korea (ROK) (the three combined accounting for 
91% of the total volume). Imports from Australia increased drastically by 3,000 tons 
(92%) from the previous year, while those from Taiwan dropped by 880 tons (63%). 
 
 
Imports in 1998 totaled 10,204 tons, an increase of 27% over 1997, exceeding the 
10,000-ton mark for the first time. Major exporters were Australia, Taiwan and the ROK 
(the three combined accounting for 92% of the total volume). Imports from the ROK 
jumped by 980 tons (146%), and those from Taiwan also expanded by 970 tons (187%). 
There was a conspicuous increase in imports from countries accommodating 
flag-of-convenience fishing vessels, such as Belize, Honduras and Equatorial Guinea. 
 
 
Imports of SBT continued an upward trend from 1993--the year when import 
statistics was first introduced in Japan--through 1998. 
 
(ii) Exports 
 
No exports of SBT from Japan has been confirmed. 
 
(2) Market trend 
1) 
1997 
 
In the entire sashimi tuna market in Japan, the supply of all tunas in 1997 totaled 
463,000 tons, with 240,000 tons coming from domestic production and 223,000 tons 
from imports. On the other hand, domestic demand was 425,000 tons, while exports 
stood at 26,000 tons. Inventories rose by 12,000 tons over the previous year. With 
regard to SBT, the average fish price at wholesale marked at producing site was 2,584 
yen/kg(Yaizu) and it fell by 214 yen (8%) as compared with 1996, as was the case for 
other species of tuna.  
 
2) 
1998 
 
In 1998 (provisional figure), in the entire sashimi tuna market, total supply of all 
tunas came to 503,000 tons, up by 78,000 tons (18%) from the previous year, due to 
brisk imports. Of which 235,000 tons were from domestic production and 268,000 tons 
from imports. By development of new market, the average SBT price at wholesale 
marked at producing site was 2,727 yen/kg(Yaizu) and it rose by 143 yen (6%) as 
compared with the previous year. 
 
(3) Mitigation measures 
 
The Government of Japan obligated all SBT fishing vessels to install Tori poles and 
Tori lines in order to avoid incidental catch of seabirds.

Annual Review of New Zealand SBT Fisheries 
 
 
1. 
Introduction 
 
 
Longlining was the predominant method used to take SBT in the New Zealand 
 
Exclusive Economic Zone, although domestic owned and operated vessels spent a 
 
limited time trolling and handlining for SBT. Domestic SBT fishing was conducted 
 
from March to mid-August 1997 with total catches of tonnes. 
 
 
Nominal CPUE for the domestic fishery declined in the 1995-96 fishing year 
 
relative to the 1994-95 year (to about 50%). Domestic nominal CPUE increased a 
 
little in 1996-97 to about 70% of the 1994-95 value. 
 
2. 
Operational constraints on effort 
 
Voluntary measures 
 
Regulatory measures 
 
 
Regulations specify an annual catch limit for SBT and make it an offence to take 
 
SBT once the catch limit has been reached. The New Zealand fishing year extends 
 
from 1 October 1997 to 30 September of the following year. The SBT catch limit 
 
for the 1997-98 fishing year was 420 tonnes. 
 
3. 
Catch and Effort 
 
 
Domestic fishing effort showed an increasing trend from 1991-92 to 1994-95 with 
 
a subsequent drop in 1995-96 attributed to very poor catch rates and low fish 
 
quality together with the absence of the charter fleet in that year. Fishing effort in 
 
1996-97 has returned only to the levels of 1991-92, and this has been attributed to 
 
economic constraints on the domestic fishery. 
 
4. 
Annual fleet size and distribution 
 
 
Whereas New Zealand domestic catches of SBT prior to the advent of longlining 
 
were largely restricted to June to August, the domestic season now extends from 
 
March to August or September. SBT fishing is still largely a winter fishery, despite 
 
some fish being caught throughout the year, with over 90% of all domestic landings 
 
being made from June to August. The domestic fishing pattern contrasts with that 
 
of Japanese foreign licensed vessels, which no longer fish in the EEZ, whose New 
 
Zealand fishing season continually contracted during the 1980s and 1990s. 
 
 
Since the early 1990s nearly all fishing for SBT (> 99%) has been conducted either 
 
off the West Coast of the South Island or off East Cape (east coast North Island).  
 
 
 
5. 
Historical fleet size and distribution 
 
 
The New Zealand domestic fishery (Charter and domestic owned and operated 
 
vessels) continues to be dynamic, exhibiting substantial changes each year. In 
 
1996-97 vessel numbers declined substantially, reportedly because of economic 
 
constraints, despite the reactivation of charter arrangements between New Zealand 
 
and Japanese companies. 
 
 
About 40 domestic vessels fished for SBT in 1996-97 compared with 50 vessels in 
 
1995-96. Vessel numbers in 1997-98 were about the same as in 1996-97. No 
 
foreign licensed longliners fished in the EEZ in 1996-97 or 1997-98. 
 
6. 
Fisheries Monitoring 
 
 
Observer coverage in 1996-97 was over 60% with 424 longline sets observed on 
 
chartered and domestic owned and operated vessels. This is a substantial increase 
 
over the previous two years (less than 30% in both years) observer coverage of the 
 
domestic fishery. Observer coverage in 1997-98 was similar to that in 1996-97. 
 
 
Biological information is collected by the Ministry of Fisheries Observer 
 
Programme. Since 1988-89 samples have been collected for genetic reference 
 
material to distinguish southern bluefin from northern bluefin tuna. In 1996-97, 
 
genetic samples were also collected from swordfish for a Japanese research project 
 
to delineate stock structure. Observers also facilitated the recovery of tags from 
 
CSIRO and SPC tagging programmes, and in 1997-98, otoliths were collected for a 
 
CSIRO direct ageing experiment. 
 
 
The New Zealand SBT fishery is managed by a competitive catch limit. The 
 
Ministry of Fisheries uses two sources to monitor the SBT catch limit. The first is 
 
be a programme which requires licensed fish receivers and larger vessels which 
 
freeze their catch to submit weekly reports of catch to the Ministry. Catch reported 
 
by this system is verified by the Ministry's catch and effort system. 
 
7. 
Other factors 
 
Import/export statistics 
 
Markets 
 
Mitigation 
 
 
New Zealand regulations specify that all tuna longline vessels are required to use 
 
seabird-scaring devices. The minimum standard for the bird scaring devices that 
 
specified by CCAMLR for tori lines. The New Zealand fishing industry have a 
 
voluntary code of practice advocating that tuna longline gear is set at night.

Annual Review of Korean Southern Bluefin Tuna Fisheries 
 
 
The Republic of Korea began to catch southern bluefin tuna in the Indian Ocean in 1991.  
In the early stage from 1991 to 1993, the production of southern bluefin tuna by Korean 
fishing vessels made very slow progress, i.e., 214 M/T in 1991, 36 M/T in 1992 and 
only 80 M/T 1993. However since 1996, the amount of harvest has increased rapidly.  
In 1996 and 1997, the catch of southern bluefin tuna reached, 1,179 M/T and 1,325 M/T 
respectively, and total catch in 1998 is estimated 1,562 M/T. 
 
The number of Korean fishing vessels for southern bluefin tuna has also shown sharp 
increase tend with 8 in 1996, 14 in 1997 and 19 vessels in 1998. It is expected that the 
Korean SBT fishing fleet will be further expanded in following years. 
 
Species composition of logline catch indicated that although the percentage of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna varied over the years, it made up of the major part of the total catch and 
the remaining 13.2% constituted bigeye, albacore, yellowfin and other species. The 
catch per unit effort (CPUE), expressed as the number of fish caught per 1,000 hooks, 
has shown an increasing trend from 1.8 in 1992 to 4.1 in 1997. 
 
As the importance of southern bluefin tuna fisheries is getting grow, Korea has a strong 
interest in ensuring proper conservation and effective utilization of southern bluefin 
tuna and in how to cooperate with related bodies and states.

Annual Review of Taiwan SBT Fisheries, 1998 
 
 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) was caught mainly by deep-sea longline fishery in Taiwan 
and was considered as a by-catch of the fishery's targets, with relatively small quantity 
in the total tuna catch (less than 1% in weight). Only few longliners equipped with 
super cold freezers targeted on the species in some seasons in the waters around 30ºS 
for its high commercial value. SBT catch of 1997 was 823 mt and preliminary 1998 
catch was 1,439 mt, about 600 mt increased from 1997. The increase was manly due to 
commercial factors, which have resulted in the target shifting of many longliners to 
albacore and subsequently made a notable amount of SBT by-catch. It was also 
attributed to the increase of seasonal-targeting longliners. 
 
2. 
OPERATIONAL CONSTRANITS ON EFFORT 
 
Taiwan has imposed a voluntary catch limit of 1,450 mt in 1996. The catch of the years 
following will be maintained to this level, unless the stock has recovered or for other 
reasons Taiwan deems appropriate. The catch limit has been applied for the year of 
1998. 
 
From 1996 onward, based on the official announcement made early 1996, every vessel 
that has caught SBT was required to report their catches in weight and fishing location 
to fishery authorities. 
 
3. 
CATCH AND EFFORT 
 
SBT is mainly a by-catch of Taiwan tuna fishery and hence the catches and fishing 
efforts were usually influenced significantly by the fleet activities and economical 
situation. Annual catches of SBT were smaller than 250 mt during early 1980s, but 
became higher than 500 mt thereafter due to the increase of operating longliners. From 
1989 onward, the SBT catches were increased to a tonnage of more than 1,000 mt, 
where drift net fishery accounted for about 1/4 of the catches in 1989 and 1990. Catch 
of 1997 has been notably decreased to less than 1,000 mt but increased again to be 
1,439 mt in 1998. 
 
4. 
CURRENT FLEET SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION 
 
SBT was caught only by longline fishery after 1993 in the three oceans with majority in 
the Indian Ocean. There was about 140 longliners reported SBT catch in 1998. 
Preliminary, about 36 of them have caught more than 10 tons, 14 increased from 1997.  
Main SBT fishing grounds of these longliners were mainly distributed in the area of 
20ºS-40ºS, which is a little bit northward than the traditionally known fishing ground. 
 
 
5. 
HISTORICAL FLEET SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION 
 
There were 35 vessels in 1994, 42-47 in 1995-1996 and 22 in 1997 landed more than 10 
tons of SBT, compared to 121 vessels in 1994, 145-189 in 1995-1996 and 80 in 1997 
which have ever caught SBT. During these years, there were about 600 longliners 
operating the three oceans, with more than 55% operating in the Indian Ocean. 
 
6. 
FISHERIES MONITORING 
 
A project for the development of vessel monitoring system incorporated with the 
function of logbook transmission was established in 1994. OFDC was commissioned to 
carry out the investigation, development, and promotion of the system in 1996. The 
system was designed not only for monitoring purpose but also for transmitting catch 
information (logbook) through friendly and easy touch-monitor with Chinese interface.  
The development of the system was completed and experiments were carried out on 12 
vessels operating in the high seas. Except for one vessel failing to send back its data due 
to hardware breakdown, the remaining 11 vessel successfully transmitted the real-time 
location information and daily catch/effort data through Inmarsat-C to the monitoring 
center located in OFDC. 
 
As from July 1997, the system has been extended to tuna and squid fisheries. Up to now, 
about 110 (including squid jiggers, purse seiners and longliners) vessels operating in the 
three Oceans have set up the system. 
 
7. 
OTHER FACTORS 
 
Mitigation on seabirds issue 
 
Taiwan is willing to cooperate with CCSBT through information exchange to improve 
understanding of the interaction between fishing operation and seabirds, and to achieve 
a significant reduction in incidental mortality of seabirds. The data collecting seabirds 
has been incorporated in the vessel monitoring system which will be installed in the 
deep sea longliners. 
 
To reduce incidental seabirds mortality, fishermen were encouraged to use tori lines 
when operating in south of 30ºS. Education program was also made through Tuna 
Association to increase the understanding of the problem among fishers.

Republic of Korea 
 
Dear Mr Park 
 
I refer to the earlier representations made by the Commission for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna ("the Commission") seeking the Republic of Korea's cooperation 
in the conservation and management of southern bluefin tuna ("SBT") and possible 
accession to the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. 
 
Considering the low level of SBT parental biomass and the Commission's agreed 
objective of rebuilding the SBT stock to 1980 levels by 2020, the Commission remains 
seriously concerned with the increasing SBT catch of the Republic of Korea and the 
lack of comprehensive data recording catches of SBT by the Republic of Korea.  
Unrestrained catch outside the Convention arrangements seriously undermines the 
management measures adopted by the Commission members since the late 1980s and 
thereby poses a serious risk to the sustainability of the SBT stock. Further, the lack of 
comprehensive data on SBT from non-members also makes it difficult to appropriately 
manage the stock. Accordingly, the Commission is giving serious consideration to a 
trade certification scheme, similar to the ICCAT model. 
 
The Commission therefore renews its call on the Republic of Korea to recognise the 
obligation of States under international law, including the United Nations Convention 
on the Law of the Sea and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement, to cooperate 
through regional fishery management organisations and to apply the conservation and 
management measures imposed by such organisations. 
 
Having considered the low level of parental biomass and the Commission's agreed 
objective of rebuilding the SBT stock to 1980 levels by 2020, but acknowledging that a 
reasonable but limited allowance should be made for non-members fishing for SBT, the 
Commission has determined that it is prepared to negotiate an acceptable level of quota 
to be made available to non-members which accede to the Convention. 
 
In order to facilitate the Republic of Korea's accession to the Commission, so that it 
would be able to be a participant at the next annual meeting of the Commission, the 
Commission has determined the following plan of action: 
 
• 
Commission members will make bilateral approaches to the Republic of Korea 
 
following the conclusion of the first part of the Commission's Fifth Annual 
 
Meeting;  and 
• 
The Commission invites the Republic of Korea to undertake formal negotiations to 
 
accede to the Convention. These negotiations would be held in conjunction with 
 
the resumed fifth meeting of the Commission. The Republic of Korea is invited to 
 
send a delegation to that meeting that is empowered to negotiate accession with the 
 
Commission. 
 
During those negotiations, the Commission will acquaint the Republic of Korea with the 
responsibilities of existing and new parties to the Convention. These responsibilities 
include: 
 
• 
Provision of SBT trade information; 
• 
Provision of catch and effort data (5 degree X 5 degree "grid" by month for long 
 
line operations);  
• 
Confirmation of a satisfactory catch monitoring system; 
• 
Potential contribution to, and participation in, any future agreed joint experimental 
 
fishing programme; 
• 
Financial contribution to the budget of the Commission; 
• 
Action to address issues relating to fishing by flag of convenience vessels;  
• 
Participation in the research programme and the work plans of the Commission; 
 
and 
• 
Implementation of the FAO International Plans of Action in respect of sharks, 
 
seabirds, and fishing capacity. 
 
The Commission requests that the Republic of Korea formally advise the Executive 
Secretary of its acceptance of the Commission's invitation to attend formal negotiations 
to discuss accession to the Convention in conjunction with the resumed fifth annual 
meeting of the Commission. This meeting is currently scheduled to be held in Tokyo, 
10-12 May 1999.

Dear Mr HU 
 
I refer to the earlier representations made by the Commission for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna ("the Commission") seeking your cooperation with the 
Commission and its conservation and management measures. 
 
The Commission recognises the voluntary restraint you have exercised on catch in 
recent years. However, considering the low level of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) 
parental biomass and the Commission's agreed objective of rebuilding the stock to 1980 
levels by 2020, the Commission remains seriously concerned that catch outside the 
Commission seriously undermines the management measures adopted by Commission 
members since the late 1980s. Such a level of catch poses a serious risk to the potential  
recovery of the SBT stock. Further, the lack of comprehensive data on SBT also makes 
it difficult to appropriately manage the stock. Accordingly, the Commission is giving 
serious consideration to the implementation of a trade certification scheme, similar to 
the ICCAT model. 
 
Having considered the low level of parental biomass and the Commission's agreed 
objective of rebuilding the stock to 1980 levels by 2020, but acknowledging that a 
reasonable but limited allowance should be made for non-members fishing for SBT, the 
Commission has determined that it is prepared to discuss an acceptable level of quota to 
be made available to non-members which cooperate with the Commission's 
conservation and management measures. 
 
In order to facilitate cooperation, and with a view to enabling participation at the next 
annual meeting of the Commission, the Commission proposes the following plan of 
action: 
 
• 
Commission members will make approaches following the conclusion of the first 
 
part of the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Commission ; and 
• 
The Commission invites you to send representatives empowered to hold 
 
discussions on cooperation with the Commission. These discussions will be held 
 
in conjunction with the resumed fifth meeting of the Commission. 
 
At that time, the Commission will outline the elements that you would be expected to 
take on as part of cooperation with the Commission. These elements include: 
 
• 
Provision of trade information; 
• 
Provision of catch and effort data (5 degree X 5 degree grid by month for long line 
 
operations);  
• 
Confirmation of a satisfactory catch monitoring system; 
• 
Potential contribution to, and participation in, any future Commission joint 
 
experimental fishing programme; 
• 
Financial contribution to the operation of the Commission; 
• 
Action to address issues surrounding flag of convenience vessels; 
• 
Participation in the research programme and the work plans of the Commission; 
 
and 
• 
Implementation of the FAO International Plans of Action in respect of sharks, 
 
seabirds, and capacity. 
 
The Commission requests that you formally advise the Executive Secretary of your 
acceptance of the Commission's invitation to attend discussions on cooperation with the 
Commission in conjunction with the resumed fifth annual meeting of the Commission.  
This meeting is currently scheduled to be held in Tokyo, from 10-12 May 1999. 
 
Yours faithfully

Catches of Southern Bluefin Tuna by Flag Of Convenience Fishing Vessels 
 
 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (the Commission), 
 
Concerned at the reflagging of fishing vessels by nationals and companies of Parties to 
the Convention on the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (the Convention) in order 
to avoid compliance with international fisheries conservation and management 
measures, and aware of numerous instances of vessel registration being transferred to 
flag of convenience (FOC) States, 
 
Further concerned by the threat to the effective conservation and management of 
southern bluefin tuna (SBT) from increasing catches of SBT by such FOC vessels, 
 
Concerned also at the commercial disadvantage resulting therefrom for fishers who fish 
responsibly through adherence to international fisheries conservation and management 
measures,  
 
Committed to promoting and enhancing the widest possible compliance with 
international agreeements and instruments which seek to ensure more effective and 
responsible conservation and management of important fisheries resources, including 
•  the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982, particularly Article 64 
 
and Part VII, Section 2; 
• 
Chapter 17, programme area C, of Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on 
 
Environment and Development, 1992; 
• 
the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 1993, particularly 
 
Article 15; 
• 
the United Nations FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with International 
 
Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas, 
 
1993; 
• 
the Agreement for the Implementation of the United Nations Convention on the 
 
Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and 
 
Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, 1995; 
• 
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation Code of Conduct for 
 
Responsible Fisheries, 1995; 
•

Fishing for Tropical Tunas in the IOTC Area of Competence - Indian Ocean Tuna 
 
Commission, 1998; and 
• 
the FAO International Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing Capacity, 
 
1999, 
 
strongly urges its Members to take measures, in accordance with their domestic laws 
and international law, to ensure that their nationals and companies do not engage in 
FOC fishing activities in an attempt to avoid compliance with internationally agreed 
management measures including those under the Convention, including: 
(a) monitoring and promoting, through the Commission, other regional fisheries 
 
management organisations and the FAO, the exchange of information on FOC 
 
fishing activities and on ownership of and investment in FOC vessels; 
(b) preventing the transfer of vessels registered under their flags to the registers of 
 
countries which are not members of a regional fisheries management organisation 
 
and regulating the export of fishing vessels catching the stocks concerned; 
(c) urging the flag States of FOC vessels to withdraw the registration of those vessels 
 
owned by nationals and companies of States to the Convention for the 
 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna; 
(d) calling upon States and other fishing entities in which owners of FOC vessels 
 
reside or are incorporated, to repatriate those vessels (that is, to return them to their 
 
own registers); 
(e) exploring effective vessel scrapping programs to ensure that fishing vessels surplus 
 
to their fishing requirements cannot become FOC vessels; 
(f) controlling, regulating or preventing transshipment of catch from FOC vessels, 
 
including refusing to such vessels, where possible, entry into their ports; 
(g) discouraging and prohibiting their nationals engaging in fishing activities on FOC 
 
vessels; and 
(h) monitoring and discouraging commercial activities, including trade and 
 
transshipment, in respect of SBT caught by FOC vessels. 
 
Attachment 21 
 
Management of Fishing Capacity of Distant Water Tuna Long-line Fishing Fleets 
 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (the Commission), 
 
Recognizing that excess fishing capacity is a significant concern in many fisheries 
world-wide, as it can lead to unsustainable catch levels, fish stock depletion and, 
ultimately, declining catches of important commercial species, with consequent adverse 
economic, social and marine environmental impacts; 
 
Having regard to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 
Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention 
on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and 
Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, which inter 
alia seek to address inadequacies in management of high seas fisheries and 
overutilisation of their resources through, among other things, excessive fleet size, 
 
Recalling that the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries of the FAO (1995) and the 
Kyoto Declaration and Plan of Action (1995) each note the need for managing fishing 
capacity, and call for the reduction of excessive fishing capacity to that end, 
 
Also recalling the International Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing Capacity 
adopted by the FAO Committee on Fisheries (COFI) in February 1999 and that the 
COFI's expression of satisfaction that the fishing capacity of tuna long-liners was being 
reduced by the major fishing nations, including Japan, and its encouragement of other 
States to make similar reductions as appropriate; 
 
Recognizing that the management measures of the Commission were successful in 
reducing catches of southern bluefin tuna (SBT) by 1990, but that non-Member catches 
have shown a strongly increasing trend since then, which threatens the conservation and 
management of SBT; 
 
1.  Welcomes Japan's announcement in 1998 of a planned reduction of twenty percent 
(namely 130 vessels) in the number of its distant water long-line tuna fishing vessels in 
the 1998 fiscal year ending on 31 March 1999 and notes progress in its implementation . 
 
2.  Call on other distant water fishing nations and fishing entities operating substantial 
long-line tuna fleets in areas within the global range of SBT, particularly the other 
leading Asian distant water tuna long-line fleets to, 
(a) take concerted action to reduce their fleet capacity by implementing their own fleet 
 
capacity reduction plans as a matter of urgency; 
(b) implement immediately the FAO International Plan of Action for the Management 
 
of Fishing Capacity, 
(c) take all relevant measures to eliminate the operation of flag of convenience fishing 
 
vessels. 
(d) Cooperating with and deciding to apply the conservation and management 
 
measures adopted by the commission. 
Attachment 22 
 
Elements for Letter to Non Members 
 
Trade Certification Scheme 
 
 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna was formally 
established by Australia, Japan and New Zealand in May 1994. However, the current 
members of the Commission collaborated for many years prior to the establishment of 
the Commission to manage the southern bluefin tuna (SBT) fishery with the 
Commission's agreed objective of rebuilding the SBT stock to 1980s levels by 2020.  
In order to achieve this objective, catch restraints have been observed by the members 
of the Commission since 1986. The total catch limit was 32 000 tonnes in 1987. This 
was reduced to 15 500 tonnes in 1988. Commission members reduced their total 
allowable catch to 11 750 tonnes in 1989, which has been maintained since that time. 
 
Commission members are concerned about recent significant increases in catches by 
non-members, which have the potential to jeopardise the recovery programme and 
could, if maintained, lead to the eventual economic collapse of the fishery for all fishing 
fleets. 
 
Further, Commission members believe that their ability to conserve and manage SBT 
under the Convention has been compromised by the lack of provision of comprehensive 
scientific data on the SBT stock. This lack of data, including catch and effort data from 
non-members, makes it difficult to conduct accurate assessments of the status of the 
SBT stock. 
 
In these circumstances, the Commission is considering the establishment of a scheme to 
collect more accurate and comprehensive data on SBT fishing, by monitoring SBT trade. 
To this end, the Commission held a Trade Information Scheme Workshop in July 1998, 
in Tokyo. The report from this meeting is attached for your information and reference.  
Further consideration is being given to a certification system for trade in SBT, using the 
ICCAT system as a model. 
 
Once the Commission has decided to adopt a trade certification scheme, it will 
immediately inform States and entities that possibly export SBT, or whose vessels are 
known to catch SBT, of the details of the scheme's application and implementation.  
The Commission anticipates the understanding of non-members in the application of a 
trade certification scheme and their cooperation in its implementation.

Report of the CCSBT Observer to the Seventeenth Meeting of CCAMLR 
 
Akihiro Mae 
Deputy Executive Secretary 
 
 
The Seventeenth Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine 
Living Resources (CCAMLR) was held in Hobart, Australia from 26 October to 6 
November 1998. 
 
All twenty three Members of the Commission were represented. Netherlands, one of  
six States Parties to the Convention but not Member of the Commission was attended as 
an observer. Mauritius and Namibia, non-Contracting Parties, were represented as 
observers in response to the invitation by the Commission. CCSBT, FAO (Food and 
Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations), IWC (International Whaling 
Commission) and SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) were 
represented as observers from intergovernmental organisations. From non-governmental 
organisations, ASOC (Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition) and IUCN (World 
Conservation Union) were attended. 
 
Trawl fishery targeting krill, and longline and trawl fisheries for Dissostichus 
eleginoides (Patagonian tooth fish) are major fishing activities in the CCAMLR 
Convention Area in recent years. Reported catches for 1997/98 fishing season were 
80,802 tonnes for krill and 11,419 tonnes for finfish. Major part (11,168 tonnes) of 
finfish caught was Dissostichus eleginoides, and the total reported catch of this species 
including both from CCAMLR waters and EEZs outside the CCAMLR Convention 
Area was 27,908 tonnes. In addition to this amount, the estimated unreported catch of D. 
eleginoides was 22,415 tonnes. 
 
At the meeting, extensive discussions including "Scientific Committee", "Illegal, 
Unregulated and Unreported Fishing in the Convention Area", "Assessment and 
Avoidance of Incidental Mortality of Antarctic Marine Living resources", and 
"Observation and Inspection" were made especially in relation to the fisheries targeting 
Patagonian tooth fish. 
 
Based on the discussions, the Commission adopted a series of conservation measures, 
and the followings are outlines of major conservation measures except measures setting 
catch limits: 
 
Automated Satellite-Linked Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) 
An VMS shall be established for the fishing vessels, which operate in the Convention 
Area not later than 1 March 1998. Any Contracting Party unable to establish VMS 
within this date shall notify its intended timetable of implementation, but in any event 
shall implement not later than 31 December 2000. The implementation of VMS on 
vessels while participating only in a krill fishery is not currently required. Contracting 
Parties shall report before the start of annual meeting of the Commission in 1999, on the 
VMS which has been introduced. 
 
Marking of Fishing Vessels and Fishing Gear 
Fishing vessels operating in the Convention Area shall be marked in accordance with 
internationally recognised standard, and such floating objects as marker buoys to locate 
fishing gear shall be clearly marked with letter(s) and/or numbers of the vessels to 
which they belong. 
 
Cooperation between Contracting Parties to Ensure Compliance with CCAMLR 
Conservation Measures with Regard to their Vessels 
When a fishing vessel of a Contracting Party operated in the Convention Area 
approaches to the port of another Contracting Party, the Flag State shall notify the Port 
States, which shall then undertake inspection of the vessel. In the event that there is 
evidence that the vessel has fished in contravention of the CCAMLR Conservation 
Measures, the Port States shall notify the Flag State and both states shall then take such 
appropriate cooperative action as is required by the Flag State to enable it to undertake 
appropriate actions in accordance with its national legislation. 
 
Scheme to Promote Compliance by the Non-Contracting Party Vessel with CCAMLR 
Conservation Measures 
A non-Contracting Party vessel, which was sighted engaging in fishing activities in the 
Convention Area, or any vessel, which was sighted engaged in transshipment activities 
with a sighted non-Contracting Party vessel is presumed to be undermining the 
effectiveness of CCAMLR Conservation Measures. When a non-Contracting Party 
vessel mentioned above enters a port of any Contracting Party, it shall not allow the 
vessels to land or transship any fish until inspection by the Port States has take place. 
Landing and transshipments of all fish from a non-Contracting Party vessel which has 
been inspected shall be prohibited in all Contracting Party ports if such inspection 
reveals that the vessels has on board species subject to CCAMLR Conservation 
Measures, unless the vessel establishes that the fish were caught outside the Convention 
Area or in compliance with all relevant CCAMLR Conservation Measure. Contracting 
Parties shall ensure that their vessels do not receive transshipment of fish from a 
non-Contracting Party vessel which has been presumed as having undermining the 
effectiveness of CCAMLR Conservation Measures. The license or its copy shall also be 
displayed on board the vessel. 
 
In addition to these measures, trade related measures were also considered but no 
conclusion was reached. A working group to discuss this issue was established and will 
meet in April next year. 
 
It is decided to hold the next Meeting of the Commission in Hobart, Australia from 25 
October to 5 November 1999 and CCSBT will be invited as an observer. The 
Commission decided that Japan and Australia would attend CCSBT5 and CCSBT6 as 
observers from CCAMLR, respectively. 
 
Attachment 24 
 
Observer Report of the First Meeting of the Scientific Committee and 
the Third Meeting of IOTC - 7 to 12 December 1998 
 
 
I attended the above meetings as an observer representing the CCSBT. 
 
The main issues considered at first meeting of the Scientific Committee, relevant to the 
CCSBT, included:  
 
1. 
A report from the Seventh Expert Consultation on Indian Ocean Tunas, 
 
 
 
 
the Committee noted that the projection results for recovery of SBT, by 
 
 
 
the three members of CCSBT, did not coincide. Japan summarised the 
 
 
 
 
outcome of their experimental fishing program and Australia 
presented its   
 
serious concern about the validity of the results. 
 
2. 
A proposal that the Commission consider re-interpreting its current mandate to 
 
include the collection of data on catches of non-target species, associated and 
 
dependent species. 
 
3. 
Guidelines for submission of data to IOTC and data confidentiality, and 
 
4. 
The establishment of permanent Working Parties on Data Collection and 
 
Statistics, and Tropical Tunas; It was agreed that the WP on Tropical Tunas 
 
should give its first priority to bigeye tuna, 
 
5. 
Options for arrangements for addressing neritic tunas, temperate tunas and billfish 
 
were developed for consideration by the Commission. 
 
The following main issues, relevant to the CCSBT, were considered at the Third 
meeting of the IOTC: 
 
1. 
The Commission endorsed the recommendations of the Scientific Committee 
 
relating to collection of data on non-target species, associated and dependent 
 
species, data submission and confidentiality, and the establishment of a 
 
Working Groups on Data Collection and Statistics, and Tropical Tunas. 
 
2. 
The Commission also agreed to establish Working Parties for Neritic Tunas, 
 
and Billfish. 
 
3. 
In regard to SBT, the Commission agreed to review, at its Fourth meeting, the 
 
progress made in overcoming existing difficulties among CCSBT members 
 
and if necessary, to decide whether a Working Party on SBT or on temperate 
 
tunas should be established to advance the effective conservation and optimum 
 
utilisation of that species. 
 
4. 
It was agreed that every effort should be made to encourage Non-contracting 
 
parties whose fleets take species covered by the Agreement, to become 
 
members of IOTC or cooperate with the Commission through provision of data. 
 
5. 
The Commission welcomed Japan's decision to reduce the capacity of its long 
 
line fleet by 20% and the voluntary moratorium applied by the EU purse seine 
 
fleets on FAD fishing over part of the year in the Western Indian Ocean and the 
 
Multi-Annual Guidance Project which, since 1983, establishes binding objectives 
 
for the reduction of the EU fleet. 
 
The official report of the meeting will be forwarded to the CCSBT when it is finalised 
by the Secretariat. 
 
Attendance at the meeting provided a valuable opportunity to establish a good working 
relationship with the Secretariat of the IOTC and establish a point of contact for the 
future exchange of information and data.

Australia's Statements on the Scientific Committee Report 
 
 
There were substantial improvements in the Scientific Committee and stock assessment 
processes in 1998 over the previous few years. Three factors greatly contributed to this: 
 
 
1. 
The implementation of the procedures developed at the Scientific Process  
 
 
Workshop; 
 
2. 
Having the technical stock assessment functions performed by the Stock  
 
 
Assessment Group (SAG) for the first time so that the Scientific Committee 
 
 
could concentrate on its review and advisory roles; and 
 
3. 
The April meeting in Shimizu to discuss the 1998 Stock assessment process 
 
 
which resulted in a shared understanding and agreements about many of the 
 
 
technical details (e.g. data, models weighting procedures) that would be  
 
 
utilized in assessments well in advance of the meeting (i.e. there were no  
 
 
technical surprises). 
 
While these three factors greatly improved the Scientific Committee process, the 
substantial delays that occurred in the completion of the data exchange meant that the 
amount of time available for performing the analyses and for preparing documents was 
reduced to less then half of the agreed minimum time needed for these activities. This 
greatly impaired the ability of the SAG and SC to complete their work. In particular this 
resulted in incomplete analyses, problems with the software verification, documents 
being tabled during the meeting and scientists having to finish papers at the meeting 
instead of focussing on the content of the assessments. It is important that the delay that 
occurred in the data exchange process be overcome in the future in order to prevent 
such impacts in the future. Finally, problems were also encountered because 
commitments undertaken to perform specific tasks prior to the meeting were not 
completed (particular with respect to lack of fit and software implementation). 
 
In spite of these difficulties, the 1998 SAG and Scientific Committee were able to 
complete a large amount of work and achieve substantial consensus on the current status 
of the stock. In particular, 
•  All VPAs suggested recruitment has markedly declined from the late 1960s 
•  The available information for most recent cohorts (1993-1995) suggests that 
 
recruitment over this period was low. 
•  All VPA results suggests that parental biomass is notably lower than the 1980's 
 
level. Weighted mean estimates of the current biomass relative to 1980 ranged from 
 
27 to 34%. 
•  The estimated most recent trends in parental biomass are partially dependent upon 
 
the estimate used for the age of maturity, for which uncertainty exists. If age 8 is 
 
used some VPA's show an upturn since 1994 while others continue to show a 
 
decline. If age 10 or 12 is used for the age of maturity, all VPAs suggest that 
 
parental biomass has continued to decline. 
•  Parental biomass is considerably less than the pre-exploitation levels. 
 
It is also important to recognize that, for those VPA models which indicated an increase 
in the parental biomass, this increase was driven by a large increase in the estimated 
number of 8-11 year old fish. Such an increase is not consistent with the recent trends in 
the CPUE series for these ages. Similar, inconsistencies were seen in all the traditional 
VPA model results. This suggests that the recent parental biomass trends estimated in 
these VPAs may be upwardly biased (e.g. overly optimistic). Only the results from the 
alternative Japanese VPA model provided a consistent fit to recent CPUE trends and in 
this in case the results did not indicate an increase in the parental biomass in recent 
years. 
 
While there was substantial agreement on the current status of the stock, projection 
results yielded a wide range of estimates for the probability of recovery to the 1980 
level by 2020 under constant current catches. Most of the differences arise from the 
different weightings assigned by each delegation to the different hypotheses used to 
account for uncertainties in the assessments and projections. 
 
As noted by Australia at the meeting, the range of estimates for the probability of 
recovery among the delegations are substantially reduced if the adequacy of the data to 
fit the different VPA models is taken into account. This is because some models are 
inconsistent with the basic input data and these models tend to yield high estimates for 
the probability of recovery. The high weighting given to these models by one delegation 
is a major factor in the disparate estimates among the national delegations. 
 
At the 1998 Scientific Committee Meeting, there was no agreement on how to account 
for this lack of fit in the estimates of current stock status or the projection estimates. 
However, a commitment was made, as documented in the Scientific Committee Report, 
that the scientists would seek an appropriate way to incorporate a procedure to account 
for lack of fit before the next SAG. This is a positive development that should provide 
for improved assessments. 
 
With respect to the projection results, it is also important to recognize that retrospective 
analyses indicate that the probability of recovery decreases when the consistently 
performed analyses are updated with an additional year's catch and effort data. In 
addition, projections produced by the Scientific Committee between 1982 and 1993 
have been shown to be consistently biased upwards and hence have been overly 
optimistic. 
 
Because of these problems with the projections, the Scientific Committee agreed on the 
following important conclusion: that "the use of a single reference point (ie the 
probability of recovery to the 1980 level by 2020) might not be appropriate and the 
reference to shorter-term projections and current stock status were suggested". 
 
It was significant, based on the analyses before it, the Scientific Committee was able to 
agree that the results had four important management implications that should be 
considered by the Commission (see page 7 of the paper). 
 
In addition to these, there were four additional management implications that Australia 
and New Zealand agreed should be considered by the Commission: 
•  The SBT stock has substantially declined since 1988 when the members imposed 
 
the current TAC. This TAC represented a reduction of over 50% compared to the 
 
previous year. 
•  Projections of recovery in the past have been shown to be overly optimistic and 
 
should be interpreted cautiously. 
• 
The overall assessment, the second and third agreed management implications, and 
 
the low probability of recovery from the projections al indicate that current catch 
 
levels, particularly with increasing non-member catches are unlikely to be 
 
sustainable. 
• 
To provide a more reliable framework for management decisions than those based 
 
on long term recovery projections, greater weight should be given to current stock 
 
status and to demonstrated evidence of stock re-building. The Scientific Committee 
 
would be better able to interpret the implications for management of current stock 
 
assessments within the context of a well defined management strategy with clear 
 
decision rules developed by the Commission. 
 
Finally, it is important to recognize that the SC report contains a number of tasks that 
were agreed to be completed before the next SAG meeting (e.g. page 6 and 7), a list of 
matters referred to the SAG (page 9) and recommendations on research needs (page 
9-10). It is important that these are matters are followed through on by Scientific 
Committee and the Commission. 
 
Attachment 26 
 
Statement by Japan 
 
 
1. 
It was regrettable that, at the last Scientific Committee meeting, difference between 
views of scientists of member countries was not reduced, an agreed stock assessment 
was not obtained and that it was rather expanded as of past years, although the technical 
process concerning the stock assessment of the Scientific Committee meeting last year 
was separated as the Stock Assessment Group. 
 
2. 
The reason which results in this situation is existence of uncertainties, and it is our 
understanding that the scientists of all members share the common view that 
uncertainties concerning CPUE and plus group treatment have major influence on this. 
Therefore, we expect the utmost effort by the people concerned to complete planning 
work for joint EFP, which is under consideration, in due time, and to enable the 
collection of new data to narrow the range of uncertainties through the implementation 
of EFP. 
 
3. 
The urgent mandate imposed to the Scientific Committee is to improve its process 
to produce an agreed stock assessment which will constitute a base for 
recommendations concerning the conservation and management measures of SBT. 
 
4 
The report of the peer review recommended that no update of the stock assessment 
will be conducted in 1999. We, therefore, consider that scientific works in the Scientific 
Committee this year should concentrate on the basic works of the stock assessment such 
as verification of VPA models and exchange of data. 
 
Attachment 27 
 
New Zealand Comments on the Report from the Scientific Committee 
 
 
The following four points were agreed by the SC: 
1. 
non-member catches have shown an increasing trend over the 1990s, contributing 
 
to the erosion of benefits from management action taken by Member States over 
 
this period; 
2. 
continued low abundance of the SBT parental biomass is cause for serious 
 
biological concern ..... catches on the spawning grounds, associated with a growing 
 
Indonesian longline fishery, have increased since 1989; 
3. 
recent increases in fishing mortality rates on juvenile fish (age 5 yr and younger) 
 
will lead to lower recruitment from these cohorts to the parental biomass; and 
4. 
there are indications that recruitment has declined in the last few years 
 
NZ also considered that there was sufficient information presented by the SAG to 
support the following additional points in respect of implications for management: 
1. 
In considering the results of assessments, especially future projections, the 
 
Commission should note that previous projections of recovery have been shown to 
 
be overly optimistic and should be interpreted with care. It is our view that long 
 
term projections should be down-weighted relative to information on current stock 
 
status. 
2. 
Continuing low parental biomass plus increases in fishing mortality on juvenile 
 
SBT (< 5 yr olds) plus the low probability of recovery in many projections plus 
 
increasing non-member catches all suggest that current catches are unlikely to be 
 
sustainable; and 
3. 
In future, the Commission should give greater weight to information on current 
 
stock status and demonstrated evidence of stock-rebuilding in considering 
 
management decisions. To improve the utility of the scientific advice in support of 
 
these decisions we consider that the Commission also needs to develop a 
 
management strategy with clear decision rules within which scientists can frame 
 
the results of their work. 
 
New Zealand also noted the confirmation by the Scientific Committee of the report 
from the Ecologically Related Species Working Group. The Scientific Committee 
particularly noted the need to address data collection and exchange issues that have 
been outstanding for the previous two meetings. 
 
Attachment 28 
 
Scientific Committee of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna 
(by Australia) 
 
 
 
The Commission received the "Report of the Fourth Meeting of the Scientific 
Committee" (CCSBT/9902/Rep.3,4), 3-6 August 1998 in Tokyo, together with the 
Secretariat paper "IGO's Attendance at the SAG and Scientific Committee Meetings", 
CCSBT/9902/15. 
 
2. 
The Commission endorsed the recommendations contained in the report, 
particularly those identified under Section 9. - Advice and recommendations - Matters 
to be referred to the SAG and Research needs. They invited the SC to further report on 
these matters in its next report to the Commission. The Commission included the work 
required in these areas in its work plan and budget of the Commission for 1999, (as set 
out in this record), noting that further discussion and prioritization may be necessary in 
CCSBT5(2). The views of the SC on Data Provision and Management and Rules of 
Procedure were noted and dealt with under other agenda items. 
 
3. 
The Commission also endorsed the format for presenting country fishery reviews, 
as set out in Appendix 2 of the Report of the Fourth Meeting of the Scientific 
Committee. 
 
4. 
The Commission noted the Scientific Committee (SC) assessment of the status of 
the SBT stock and the implications for management in the Report of the Fourth Meeting 
of the Scientific Committee, particularly as they relate to recruitment and parental 
biomass. The Commission decided to further consider these matters in due course in the 
light of its consideration of the Report of the SBT 1998 Peer Review Panel and of the 
report of the EFP Working Group. To this end, the Commission requested the EFP 
Working Group and the working group considering the Report of the SBT 1998 Peer 
Review Panel, in undertaking their work, to take appropriate account of the Report of 
the Fourth Meeting of the Scientific Committee. 
 
5. 
The Commission noted the specific areas of research recognised by the SC as 
requiring collaboration between member and non-member scientists, involving otolith 
archiving, recruitment monitoring, port sampling in Indonesia and Taiwan, and fine 
scale CPUE analyses. The Commission requested continuation and further development 
of this collaborative research and invited the SC to further report on these matters in its 
next report to the Commission. 
 
6. 
The Commission noted that participation of member scientists in the work of the 
EFP Working Group and the nature of some recommendations in the Report of the SBT 
1998 Peer Review Panel may require an adjustment to the nature and timing of the work 
and meetings of the SC in 1999 and beyond. It invited the Parties to consider and agree 
intersessionally to any necessary adjustments concerning this matter, as soon as possible. 
The work program and budget is included in this report, but may require further 
discussion and refinement at CCSBT5(2). 
 
7. 
The Commission recognised that consultation and cooperation with scientists 
representing other relevant intergovernmental organisations (IGOs) may assist the SC to 
carry out its role under Article 9(2) of the Convention and contribute, with respect to 
obtaining relevant scientific information, to the further attainment of the objective of the 
Convention. Taking into account the Secretariat paper CCSBT/9902/15, the 
Commission requested the Secretariat, in consultation intersessionally with the Parties 
to the Convention and the current Chair of the SC, to develop and implement by [30 
June 1999] procedures to  
 
(a) identify, and as necessary update, the names of the particular IGOs best able to so 
 
assist the SC and, as appropriate, its Stock Assessment Group (SAG); 
(b) compile, and as necessary update, a list of the scientists who can represent these 
 
particular IGOs; 
(c) provide to the Parties, well in advance of each future meeting of the SC, copies of 
 
relevant new reports and papers from these particular IGOs in order to facilitate 
 
effective consultation and cooperation with their representative scientists; 
(d) invite the attendance at each future meeting of the SC or its SAG, as appropriate, of 
 
relevant scientists to represent each particular IGO identified in sub-paragraph (a) 
 
above, such attendance to be at no cost to the Commission's budget, and to involve 
 
scientists on the list compiled in accordance with sub-paragraph (b) above who, as 
 
far as possible, will also be members of a delegation to the particular SC or SAG 
 
meeting from a Party to the Convention.

Attachment 30 
 
Guidelines for Design and Deployment of Tori Lines 
 
 
Preamble 
 
These guidelines are designed to assist in preparation and implementation of tori line 
regulations for long-line vessels. 
 
While these guidelines are relatively explicit, they are not intended to inhibit 
improvement in tori line effectiveness through experimentation. The guidelines have 
taken into account environmental and operational variables such as weather conditions, 
setting speed and ship size, all of which influence tori line performance and design in 
protecting baits from birds. Tori line design and use may change to take account of these 
variables provided that line performance is not compromised. The working group 
envisages ongoing improvement in tori line design and consequently review of these 
guidelines should be undertaken in the future.  
 
Tori Line Design 
 
1. 
It is recommended that a tori line 150 m in length be used. The diameter of the 
 
section of the line in the water may be greater than that of the line above water. 
 
This increases drag and hence reduces the need for greater line length and takes 
 
account of setting speeds and length of time taken for baits to sink. The section 
 
above water should be a strong fine line (e.g. about 3 mm diameter) of a 
 
conspicuous colour such as red or orange. 
2. 
The above water section of the line should be sufficiently light that its movement is 
 
unpredictable to avoid habituation by birds and sufficiently heavy to avoid 
 
deflection of the line by wind. 
3. 
The line is best attached to the vessel with a robust barrel swivel to reduce tangling 
 
of the line. 
4. 
The streamers should be made of material that is conspicuous and produces an 
 
unpredictable lively action (e.g. strong fine line sheathed in red polyurethane 
 
tubing) suspended from a robust three-way swivel (that again reduces tangles) 
 
attached to the tori line, and should hang just clear of the water. 
5. 
There should be a maximum of 5-7 m between each streamer. Ideally each streamer 
 
should be paired. 
6. 
Each streamer pair should be detachable by means of a clip so that line stowage is 
 
more efficient. 
7. 
The number of streamers should be adjusted for the setting speed of the vessel, 
 
with more streamers necessary at slower setting speeds. Three pairs are appropriate 
 
for a setting speed of 10 knots.  
 
Deployment of Tori Lines 
 
1. 
The line should be suspended from a pole affixed to the vessel. The tori pole should 
 
be set as high as possible so that the line protects bait a good distance astern of the 
 
vessel and won't tangle with fishing gear. Greater pole height provides greater bait 
 
protection. For example, a height of around 6 m above the water line can give 
 
about 100 m of bait protection. 
2. 
The tori line should be set so that streamers pass over baited hooks in the water. 
3. 
Deployment of multiple tori lines is encouraged to provide even greater protection 
 
of baits from birds. 
4. 
Because there is the potential for line breakage and tangling, spare tori lines should 
 
be carried onboard to replace damaged lines and to ensure fishing operations can 
 
continue uninterrupted. 
5. 
When fishers use a bait casting machine (BCM) they must ensure coordination of 
 
tori line and machine by: 
 
 
a) 
ensuring the BCM throws directly under the tori line protection and 
 
 
b) 
when using a BCM that allows throwing to port and starboard, ensure that 
 
 
 
two tori lines are used. 
6. 
Fishers are encouraged to install manual, electric or hydraulic winches to improve 
 
ease of deployment and retrieval of tori lines. 
 
A standard design is detailed in various educational material available to fishers eg. 
Longline fishing dollars and sense, Catch fish not birds, and Fish the seas not the sky.

Attachment 33 
 
Summary of the results of the EFP conducted in 1998 
 
1. There have been considerable differences of views between the scientists in the 
Scientific Committee concerning the current status and future projections of the 
Southern Bluefin Tuna stock. The Scientific Committee meeting in 1998 identified two 
major sources of uncertainties in the SBT stock assessment, which caused the 
differences of view, i.e. the methods to incorporate the plus group into analysis and the 
interpretations of abundance indices based on CPUE. The EFP conducted last year was 
planned and implemented to address the latter issue of the difference of views on the 
interpretations of CPUE. 
 
2. The EFP was conducted from 10 July to 31 August 1998 in the Statistical Area 8 with 
the participation of 65 tuna longliners. 
 
3. The difference in the interpretations of CPUE has been caused because of the periods 
and areas with no recent data of commercial operations, and many hypotheses have 
been presented to offer different views on the CPUE in these periods and areas. Under 
the current framework, weightings for each hypothesis in the stock assessment are 
decided based on the subjective beliefs of the scientists. The main purpose of the EFP is 
to move from the subjective weightings to the objective weightings based on the figures 
obtained by the direct sampling. The research methods are described in detail in the EFP 
98 Plan (CCSBT-SC/9807/30). 
 
4. In the operation, research vessels are divided into two groups, one for the 
investigation of the distribution of SBT in the whole research area and the other for the 
identification of presumed distribution of commercial vessels in the research period. 
Then, the ratio of CPUE between "no recent commercial operation" area and the area 
where the commercial operation is concentrated (R) were obtained based on the results 
of the EFP. 
 
5. The result shows that the average estimates of the CPUE ratio between the presumed 
commercial operation area and the "no recent commercial operation" area are 0.56-0.95 
for July and 0.39-0.80 for August. The lower limits show the estimates when the density 
of fish in the area where no research data is available is assumed as zero, while the 
upper limits are for the estimates obtained using only the research data with, thus, no 
assumptions. Further, although the research was conducted in the off commercial 
fishing season, CPUE of 0.58 ton/operation, which is similar to the normal commercial 
operation, was obtained. 
 
6. The abundance index was recalculated based on the lower limit of the ratio of CPUEs 
(R) to have a conservative side of the estimate and then the stock assessment and 
projection were conducted. The agreed methods at the Scientific Committee meeting in 
1997 were used for the calculation. The difference between the three countries in the 
estimation of the recovery probabilities of the spawning stock biomass to achieve the 
1980 level by 2020, which is the agreed management objective, was reduced 
substantially from previously calculated 55% to 27%, when weights on the hypotheses 
for the interpretation of CPUE calculated from the results of the research is used. 
Furthermore, the overall recovery probability as the average of the views of the three 
countries increased from 31% to 81-83%, when the results of the research was 
incorporated. This means that the analyses based on the result of the research narrowed 
down the range of the uncertainties and proved the past assessment to have been 
pessimistic. 
 
7. Further, the EFP catch had very little impact on the SBT stock, since the catch of 
1,500 ton per year has proved to have almost no effect on the recovery probability. 
 
8. Although the data obtained supported the Japanese view that the variable square 
hypothesis is unrealistic, it is necessary to further improve the stock assessment by 
CCSBT by accumulating scientific data through research. It is important for CCSBT to 
agree on a joint EFP based on the detailed analyses of the EFP conducted last year. 
 
9. Japan has been proposing to increase the TAC by at least 3,000 ton since CCSBT3. It 
was proved to increase the TAC as Japan proposed will have little effect on the SBT 
stock based on the results obtained from the research last year. The recovery probability 
under the increased TAC by 3,000 ton will be 70-80% when the Japanese weightings are 
used within the agreed framework of the Scientific Committee meeting in 1997.
