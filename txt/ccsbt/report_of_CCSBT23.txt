Report from the Secretariat 
9. 
The report from the Secretariat was provided to the meeting as paper CCSBT-
EC/1610/04.  The meeting noted the activities of the Secretariat as reported. 
 
10. New Zealand commented that it supported the Secretariat’s plan to update its 
database as well as the Secretariat’s approach of drawing on database 
development work being conducted by the Pacific Community (SPC).  
11. The Extended Commission noted that the Executive Secretary’s contract with the 
CCSBT expires on 30 October 2017 and recommended to the Commission that 
Mr Kennedy’s contract as Executive Secretary be renewed for another three year 
term from that date.   
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
12. Mr. Dominic Vallières from New Zealand was nominated as Chair of the Finance 
and Administration Committee (FAC).  Members nominated their participants to 
the FAC. 
13. The Executive Secretary provided a brief presentation of the draft revised budget 
for 2016 (CCSBT-EC/1610/05), and the proposed budget for 2017 and indicative 
budget for 2018-2019 (CCSBT-EC/1610/06).   
14. The Executive Secretary noted that the 2017 draft budget and 2018-2019 
indicative budget includes funding to implement the Extended Scientific 
Committee’s three-year workplan with the exception of the aerial survey from 
2018. Detailed consideration of the two budget papers was referred to the 
Finance and Administration Committee (FAC). 
15. The FAC was convened to consider: 
• The revised budget for 2016; 
• The proposed budget for 2017; and  
• The indicative budget for 2018-2019. 
 
3.1. Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
16. The Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC) presented the 
report of the FAC, which is provided at Attachment 6. It includes a revised 
budget for 2016, a recommended budget for 2017, and indicative budgets for 
2018-2019. 
2016 
17. The meeting adopted the revised 2016 budget which is provided at Annex A of 
the FAC’s report. 
2017 
18. The meeting adopted the 2017 budget which is provided at Annex B of the 
FAC’s report.  
2018 to 2019 
19. The FAC noted the indicative budgets of 2018-2019. 
 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries and ERS Interactions 
20. The Chair noted the deliberations of the Compliance Committee (CC) and invited 
Members to ask any additional questions regarding Members’ National Reports 
to those already raised at the Eleventh Meeting of the Compliance Committee 
(CC 11). 
21. In response to questions for clarification, Australia reconfirmed its commitment 
on stereo video in 2013 and advised that its government’s position has not 
changed. Australia will not implement stereo video measurement for farmed SBT 
until it is cost effective and fully automated.  A research project is currently 
underway into automation of the measurements and the report from this project is 
expected towards the end of 2016.  Once the project is completed, the 
government will consider the results and then decide on the next steps.  Australia 
committed to provide Members with the report of the research project once it is 
available, and to notify Members of the government’s plans with regard to 
implementation of stereo video monitoring as soon as the government makes a 
decision after the research project is completed. 
 
4.1. Reports on Members’ projects 
22. No reports were provided in relation to Members’ projects. 
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
23. The Independent Chair of the Compliance Committee, Mr. Frank Meere, 
presented the report of CC 11, including its workplan (refer to paragraph 128), 
and thanked participants for a productive meeting.  The report of CC11 is 
provided at  Attachment 7. 
24. With respect to paragraph 51 of the CC Report, Taiwan questioned the use of the 
phrase “in force for the CCSBT” since CCSBT as an intergovernmental 
organisation is not a Contracting Party to the UNFSA. New Zealand clarified that 
this language was intended to indicate that the UNFSA boarding and inspection 
measures could be applicable between UNFSA Parties for the purpose of 
ensuring compliance with CCSBT CMMs.  
25. The CC Chair drew attention to CC 11’s recommendations at paragraph 133 of 
its report.  The EC adopted CC 11’s report and recommendations with the 
exception of the following, which the EC considered on an individual basis: 
• The action agreed by the EC on e-monitoring is changed from the CC’s 
recommendation to the following: “That the implementation of E-monitoring 
not be pursued in 2017 as provided for in the 2015-17 Compliance Action 
Plan, but that consideration of the implementation of E-monitoring be 
included in the 2018-20 Compliance Action Plan.”. 
• The recommendation “That the Executive Secretary sends a letter to the 
Philippines advising that its CNM status is in jeopardy as necessary reports 
have not been submitted and it does not attend key meetings, and noting also 
that it has not renewed its commitments as a CNM.” is deferred for 
consideration at agenda item 11. 
 
• The recommendation “That the Executive Secretary write to the appropriate 
Chinese authorities and seek information on the ‘Fu Yuan Yu’ fleet, in 
particular the action taken in relation to the use of large scale driftnets and 
details of their catch of SBT Members will be given an opportunity to review 
the draft letter.” is deferred for consideration at agenda item 12. 
• The recommendation “That the Extended Commission notes that the 
Compliance Committee is unable to provide an estimate of non-Member 
catches but that it is clear these are occurring both as target and bycatch.” is 
deferred for consideration at agenda item 7. 
• The recommendation “That the Extended Commission adopts the proposed 
Resolution on large-scale driftnet fishing as provided in Attachment 7 of the 
CC11 report.” is deferred for consideration at agenda item 18. 
26. New Zealand noted that further work in relation to the IUU List Resolution was 
still ongoing (with respect to paragraph 96 of the CC report) and that it will 
report back on this under Other Business (agenda item 18). 
27. New Zealand also noted that compliance resources needed to be focused on the 
areas of highest risk, and strongly supported the recommendation relating to 
compliance functions and resourcing. 
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
28. The Chair of the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC), Dr John Annala, 
presented the report of the ESC meeting which is summarised in papers CCSBT-
EC/1610/09 and CCSBT-EC/1560/18. The full ESC Report is at Attachment 8.    
29. Members asked the ESC Chair a number of questions on the ESC presentation 
with respect to the change in length frequency distribution in the Indonesian 
catch, “Added catch” scenario ranges, how unaccounted mortalities (UAM) 
affects the stock rebuilding, the purpose of an UAM point estimate or range 
provided by the EC to the ESC, and the difference between the Non-Member 
catch figures in the ESC summary and the ESC report.  In response to these 
questions, the ESC Chair advised that: 
• The median length from the Indonesian fishery had been steadily declining 
since the early 2000s, consistent with a stock that is being fished down, but 
there has been a pronounced and rapid decrease over the past 4 years. It is 
expected that this is due to the Indonesian fleet fishing further South in areas 2 
and 8, where smaller SBT are found; 
• The “Added catch” scenario with 1000t of smaller fish plus 1000t of larger 
fish in addition to the 20% uncertainty assumed for the surface fishery catch to 
account for UAM results in the stock rebuilding to the target slower; 
• If TAC is not increased then the rebuilding target could be achieved more 
quickly, but stock rebuilding is also impacted by UAM; 
• The ESC could not rule out the “Added catch” scenario of 1000t + 1000t + 
20% for uncertainty for the surface fishery as a plausible scenario for 
unaccounted mortalities in its recent deliberations; 
 
• For the MP, CPUE is standardised using statistical methods and takes into 
account changes in areas fished; 
• The ESC requires a range of possible UAM before June 2017 for both the 
2017 stock assessment and also for the MP, which would ideally be provided 
by the EC. If the EC is unable to provide that then ESC will use its best 
judgement to come up with a range. ESC needs a time series for UAM, both 
for the past and for the future; 
• The ESC decided that leaving the TAC at current levels for 2017 would not 
unduly harm the stock given that the EC will take UAM into account when 
setting the TAC for 2018-2020 and will account for the entire attributable 
catch of Members and CNMs from 2018; and 
30. It was noted without action that it was likely that Non-Member catches would 
increase as the stock rebuilds and they were not a constant over time. This was 
especially important to consider given that quota block allocations last for 3 
years. 
31. Members discussed the ESC request that relevant CDS and market data be made 
available to allow technical evaluation of catch assumptions to be used in the OM 
and MP testing process. It was suggested by New Zealand that this was a 
longstanding issue that was impeding the science and that Australia had not 
agreed to release its CDS data until Japan provided its market data. 
32. Japan pointed out that the CDS data was provided by all CCSBT Members 
including Japan and they are under the control of the Secretariat, which may be 
released with the decision of the EC, while the data on the market is specific to 
Japan. Therefore the nature of CDS data was totally different from that of the 
additional Japan’s market data which was requested by Australia. 
33. Australia noted that it had continually requested Japan to supply the market 
details, the same as those released for the Japan Market Review in 2006. 
Australia also again requested Japan to release the data it was using in its past 
farm analyses. 
34. Japan also noted that it has provided documents containing market data to the CC 
and can provide those to the ESC as well. Australia believed that the data 
provided to the CC did not meet the previously specified requirements, but would 
review what has been provided and come back to the EC if it was satisfactory. 
35. Some Members commented that they would like to see progress on this issue 
during the year and didn’t see the link between the two datasets from a science 
perspective. New Zealand suggested that it could be a good time to consider a 
review of the Japanese market, and to consider a project for a new survey design. 
36. The EC approved the report of ESC 21 and noted the ESC’s recommendations.  
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
7.1. Attributable SBT Catch 
37. The Chair commented that Members were requested to report on their progress in 
implementing the agreed common definition of the SBT Attributable Catch, in 
their annual report to CCSBT 23. 
 
38. All Members provided a summary of their progress with regard to implementing 
the Attributable SBT catch and counting all sources of mortality against their 
allocations as follows.   
39. Australia confirmed its intention to account for all sources of mortality by the 
2018 quota year.  It is continuing with research into estimating recreational catch 
and post-release survival.  Australian regulations forbid discarding unless the 
SBT is in an alive and vigorous state.  In the longline sector, Australia cross-
checks its e-monitoring footage against scientific observer data to further monitor 
the occurrence of discards. 
40. The European Union reported that it is not catching SBT as either a target or a 
bycatch species and that it therefore does not have any catch to attribute.  One 
Member queried whether the European Union has any mechanism to account for 
non-commercial catch such as small amounts of SBT catch being donated to 
crew, as has been reported in the past. The European Union responded that there 
was no recent evidence of such a scenario having occurred, and no mechanism to 
account for such non-commercial catch. 
41. Taiwan reported that it only has a commercial SBT fishery, and that all SBT 
(including discards and releases) will be counted against its allocation from this 
fishing season (2016/2017). 
42. Indonesia reported that its SBT are only caught by commercial and artisanal 
vessels and that its entire commercial and artisanal SBT catch is tagged and 
recorded on CDS forms and it is all counted against its allocation.  There is no 
recreational or traditional catch and no releases/discards.   Therefore there is no 
SBT mortality that is not attributed. Therefore, Indonesia’s Attributable catch 
includes all SBT that are tagged and recorded on Catch Tagging Forms (CTFs). 
43. Japan noted that it has 20t of quota put aside to cover SBT release mortalities, 
and that this 20t was set aside on a trial basis commencing from this current 
2016/17 season. 
44. Korea has analysed SBT discard rates and submitted those in this year’s report.  
Full implementation of the Attributable Catch will occur from 2018.   
45. New Zealand confirmed that it already counts all sources of SBT mortality 
against its allocation, and attempts to ensure that its allowances are suitable 
through its observer programme.  While an allowance is made for customary 
catches as required by relevant legislation, there is no evidence to suggest that 
any customary catch of SBT has actually occurred.    
46. South Africa noted that up until 2016 it has had a very small allocation.  All SBT 
was landed and no other mortalities or discards occurred. Now that it has 
received an increased allocation, South Africa is progressing the appointment of 
a service provider to manage its observer programme, and will be better able to 
report on Attributable Catch once this observer programme is in place. 
47. The EC recognised the progress made by Members to date, and noted that 
Members have renewed their commitment to count all sources of mortalities 
against their allocations by 2018.   
 
 
7.2. TAC Determination 
48. Members discussed the TAC for 2017, with most Members accepting the ESC 
recommendation that the TAC for 2017 does not need to be changed. New 
Zealand considered that the 2017 TAC should not be confirmed until an 
appropriate allowance is agreed for the IUU catch by Non-Members for the 
2018-2020 quota block, as New Zealand interpreted the recommendations from 
the ESC as being conditional on that. 
49. The meeting discussed the quantity required to account for the IUU catch by 
Non-Members for the 2018-2020 quota block. Some Members considered that 
182.5t was appropriate, being the mid-point of the estimate of non-Member IUU 
catches in the report of the ESC, while acknowledging that this figure did not 
account for all non-Member catch. New Zealand did not consider this estimate to 
be precautionary because the ESC estimate only provided catch estimates for 
fishing effort that had been reported to the other tuna RFMOs and there is plenty 
of evidence of significant NCNM IUU catch not accounted for in this estimate.   
New Zealand considered that a value of 1000t was more appropriate to account 
for the IUU catch by non-Members. 
50. Members had extensive discussions in relation to the MP, the rebuilding target, 
whether it was appropriate to raise the TAC given that the stock was at a very 
low level, and whether raising the TAC would help the stock rebuild more 
quickly. Members generally agreed that the MP and the rebuilding targets should 
be adhered to as had been agreed previously, and that the stock had been 
improving under the MP. Some Members felt that more caution was required, 
especially with respect to the IUU catch by Non-Members, for the sustainability 
of the stock. 
51.  The TAC for 2017 was confirmed to remain at 14,647t in accordance with the 
recommendation of the Management Procedure as confirmed by the ESC.  The 
allocations to Members and CNMs for 2017 also remains unchanged. 
52. There was extensive discussion on the TAC and its allocation for 2018 to 2020, 
including accounting for the IUU catch by Non-Members. 
53. The meeting agreed that the global TAC for 2018-2020 would be 17,647t as 
recommended by the MP.  Within the global TAC, Members have agreed that: 
• 306t would be set aside to account for IUU catch by Non-Members; and 
• 6t would be set aside for RMA instead of the usual 10t. 
 
7.3. Research Mortality Allowance 
54. The Chair advised the meeting that the ESC had recommended that a Research 
Mortality Allowance (RMA) of 3.0 tonnes be granted for the CCSBT Gene 
Tagging Project and that 1.7 tonnes be granted to Australia and 1.0 tonne be 
granted to Japan for the projects listed in paper CCSBT-EC/1610/10 from the 
Secretariat. 
55. The EC approved these RMA requests. 
 
 
7.4. Allocation of TAC 
56. Indonesia requested that the EC consider its request for an increase of up to 300t 
in its current allocation.  Indonesia noted that it has been requesting this increase 
since 2013, and that its current allocation is too low in comparison to its fishing 
capacity.  Indonesia also commented that it is a developing country with many 
small scale fishers and that it is a range State for SBT. Finally, Indonesia advised 
that with its new quota management system, it is able to ensure that its catch does 
not exceed its allocation. 
57. South Africa requested that as a developing State, a range State for SBT and an 
important port State for SBT, the EC consider allocating an additional 1000t of 
SBT quota.  South Africa is seeking the additional allocation to create jobs and 
develop industry and noted that there is a possibility of South Africa exceeding 
its allocation due to its small allocation. 
58. Following extensive discussion, the following was agreed in relation to the 
annual TAC for 2018-2020: 
• The Philippines allocation has been set to zero, noting its lack of catches of 
SBT and that it has not been reporting to or attending meetings of the CCSBT.  
If a later allocation is made to the Philippines, it would be sourced from 
Members on a pro-rata basis. 
• The allocation of the European Union will not be reduced below 10t in the 
event of a future reduction in the global TAC.  
• Members’ allocations have been adjusted in accordance with the Resolution 
on Allocation of the TAC, with the addition that the allocations of Indonesia 
and South Africa have been increased above that amount.  The new allocations 
of Members and their nominal catch proportions are shown in columns “(1)” 
and “(2)” of Table 1 below.   
• Japan is providing a voluntary transfer of 21t to Indonesia and 27t to South 
Africa for the 2018 to 2020 quota block.  This transfer is included in column 
“(3)” of Table 1.  6165 will be Japan’s starting point in considering the 
allocation from 2021.

59. In relation to the decisions on the TAC and allocations for 2018-2020, New 
Zealand noted its concern that the sustainability of SBT took second priority to 
Member allocations and in particular ignored clear evidence of unaccounted non-
Member IUU catch.  In addition New Zealand reiterated its expectations that 
Members properly account for all catch attributable to them within their 
allocations for 2018-2020. 
60. The European Union pointed out its satisfaction that the EC could reach 
agreements on TAC and allocations. Nevertheless, the European Union stressed 
that it consider that the first priority when decision is made on TACs and 
allocations should be maintaining sustainable management of the related stocks 
at high standards.   In this regard the European Union regretted that the CCSBT 
23 did not take fully into account the risks related to the non-reported catches 
when SBT TAC decision was made, notably the risks related to SBT fishing 
activities and IUU catches from non-Members. Furthermore, the European Union 
highlighted that it was important to reach an agreement on allocations to 
accommodate the legitimate requests and rights of some Members to increase 
their quotas. However, this should not be done at the expenses of sustainability, 
endangering the SBT sound management. To conclude, the European Union 
encouraged all Members to follow a more precautionary position in the future to 
reinforce sustainability when deciding on TACs and allocations. 
61. HSI shared New Zealand's sustainability concern over imprudent raising of the 
TAC and, further, urged this EC to invite CC 12 to prepare advice on a 
comprehensive approach to dealing with IUU fishing in the SBT fishery, 
including advice to ESC on development of, and attribution of values for, 
compliance parameters for inclusion in the operating model for the management 
procedure. 
62. TRAFFIC expressed disappointment that most of the discussion about the TAC 
was not held in plenary but at the Heads of Delegations meeting. The SBT stock 
is estimated to still be at an extremely low level and the EC needs to minimise 
the uncertainties affecting the probability of reaching the rebuilding target. 
TRAFFIC urged the EC that if more information of IUU non-Member catch is 
revealed over the next three years, the amount of Non-Member IUU catch should 
be deducted from annual TAC for 2018-2020 as exceptional circumstances. 
63. Australia thanked all Members for their constructive approach to the discussion 
and debate. Australia indicated that, while a balanced outcome had been 
achieved, the understandably contentious discussions were made more 
problematic by the absence of an agreed approach or guidance in the EC’s 
procedures to assist such deliberations. Australia undertook to consider this issue 
further and come back to the EC, through the Secretariat, with suggestions. 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
CCSBT Strategic Plan 
64. The Secretariat presented paper CCSBT-EC/1610/11 which provides background 
information on the current CCSBT Strategic Plan and its five-year Action Plan.  
Discussions focused on seven action items specified for 2016 that are not 
considered elsewhere in other CCSBT meetings and agenda items, as well as on 
an eighth item, which is a request from the EU to have a ‘round table’ discussion 
 
to consider the possibility of amending the CCSBT Convention to allow REIOs 
and Fishing Entities to become Members of the CCSBT Commission. 
 
Review rules for commercially confidential scientific data to encourage sharing of 
these data in order to harmonise activities with other RFMOs and improve the 
functioning of the Commission 
65. The EC discussed options to modify the CCSBT’s Rule and Procedures for the 
Protection, Access to, and Dissemination of Data Compiled by the CCSBT.  
Members agreed that the Secretariat should conduct a review of the risk 
classifications assigned to each type of CCSBT data to enable sharing of 
appropriate datasets and to present this to CCSBT 24 for consideration. 
Review the Chairing arrangements of each subsidiary or advisory body of CCSBT 
to provide greater consistency in the chairing arrangements amongst each 
subsidiary body 
66. Australia presented the paper CCSBT-EC/1610/20 which proposed chairing 
arrangements for CCCSBT subsidiary bodies. 
67. Members discussed the proposal, particularly in relation to the extent of 
independence that was required for a Chair.  It was agreed by some Members that 
an employee of a Member government could be considered to be suitable as an 
independent Chair if they were not in a position of authority to make related 
policy changes for that government. It was also noted that there could be cost 
benefits if Member government employees were considered suitable for Chairing 
roles. 
68. Some Members noted that it seemed unusual not to allow the CC Chair to be a 
government officer or official.  In this regard, it was noted that some other 
RFMOs appoint voluntary CC Chairs from Member States, whereas the 
CCSBT’s CC Chair is an independent, remunerated position.   
69. One Member noted that the exceptional circumstance currently in place for the 
ESC Chair (“…. except where Members reach a consensus to choose the 
qualified individual.”) had not been included in the proposed new independence 
criteria, and proposed that it be added. There was no objection to this suggestion. 
70. The meeting discussed a further proposed revision of the chairing arrangements 
for its subsidiary bodies which included the exceptional circumstance for the 
appointment of the ESC Chair noted in the paragraph above. 
71. The European Union and Japan noted that it could accept the proposed 
arrangements, in the framework of the established CCSBT Chairing practices.  
However, the European Union and Japan pointed out that in other RFMOs, 
Members’ officials are commonly appointed to Chair subsidiary bodies.  In this 
context cost savings could potentially be achieved by allowing a Member’s 
official to Chair in particular, the CC/CCWG.   
72. The meeting agreed to the Chairing arrangements for CCSBT subsidiary bodies 
provided at Attachment 9. 
73. The meeting discussed the ESC Chair’s (Dr. Annala’s) current contract which 
expires in May 2017.  It was agreed to extend the current ESC Chair’s contract 
for one additional year, and to concurrently begin the process of appointing the 
 
ESC Chair for the subsequent 3 year term (from mid-2018 to mid-2020) 
following CCSBT 23.  
74. The Executive Secretary explained that with regard to the recent appointment of 
the CC Chair (Mr. Meere), the Chair-elect overlapped with the existing CC 
Chair’s term, and this allowed the Chair-elect to attend CC10 as part of a 
handover process, which had been beneficial. 
75. The Executive Secretary further explained that renewing the contract of the 
existing ESC Chair for one year had no financial impact on the budget, and that 
having the ESC Chair-elect attend the ESC concurrently with the existing ESC 
Chair was estimated to have a ‘ballpark’ cost impact of approximately $15,000. 
76. The meeting noted that costs for this had not been included in the budget.  
However, the Executive Secretary was authorised to make this expenditure, if 
required, using the Secretariat’s savings.  
Explore funding sources other than Member governments’ assessed contributions 
to support the work of the Extended Commission 
77. With respect to exploring funding sources other than Member Governments’ 
assessed contributions, the Secretariat reported back on communications with ten 
RFMOs concerning the major types of funding sources that they rely on, noting 
that: 
• Member contributions and internal funds were the major source of funding for 
the eight RFMOs, and comprised over 95% of the funds for 4 RFMOs; 
• CCAMLR and IATTC do have an important source of income from fees for 
services and fisheries access, but for IATTC most of this income appears to be 
cost recovered for specific services provided;  
• Voluntary funds are an important source of income for most RFMOs; and 
• Non-Member contributions are not a major income source.   
78. From examination of other RFMOs’ funding arrangements, the Secretariat 
proposed four potential funding source options for Members to consider: 
(1)  To establish an environment that facilitates and encourages voluntary 
contributions from Members and Cooperating Non-Members; 
(2)  To encourage host Members to fund the venue, catering and equipment 
costs of Extended Scientific Committee meetings and of Compliance 
Committee and Extended Commission meetings; 
(3)  To establish a SBT quota allocation for funding of research and monitoring; 
(4)  To establish a Working Group on Strengthening CCSBT Financing. 
79. All Members supported option “1” above in principle, and it was suggested 
option “1” could be further expanded to include contributions from organisations 
such as the World Bank and Non-Government Organisations (NGOs). It was 
proposed that the Secretariat could investigate establishing a voluntary fund to 
which contributions could be made, including drafting guidelines to outline how 
the funds may be used appropriately.  Some Members noted that they may have 
administrative difficulties with regard to making contributions to such a fund. It 
was agreed that the Secretariat would work intersessionally with Members to 
develop a policy for establishing voluntary funds that would suit all Members. 
 
80. Members also supported option “2” providing that provision of such funding by 
the hosting Member is a voluntary arrangement. 
81. Most Members did not support options “3” and “4”.  Most Members felt that the 
FAC could fulfil the role of the working group proposed for option 4. 
Develop programme to assist developing countries with Commission requirements 
82. With respect to developing a programme to assist developing countries: 
• South Africa noted that while it is classified as a Developing State, it does not 
require any special assistance from Members, and is already participating in a 
variety of capacity building projects, include with other RFMOs, the Common 
Oceans ABNJ Tuna project and the FAO Port State Measures implementation 
project. 
• Indonesia confirmed that it would welcome any kind of assistance, especially 
in the scientific area. 
• The meeting concluded that there is currently no need for such a specific 
capacity building program, but that if one was required in future, a request can 
be made directly to EC. 
Define processes for those seeking cooperating non-Member or membership status 
to the CCSBT 
83. The Secretariat presented two draft web pages for the CCSBT website to provide 
information on the processes for those seeking CNM or Membership status to the 
CCSBT.  
84. Members agreed that the shorter version of the web page (Attachment C of 
CCSBT-EC/1610/11) was the most appropriate, as any candidate wishing to 
apply for CNM or Member status would be able to find all of the relevant 
documents. 
Ensure past Commission decisions are readily accessible 
85. The Secretariat presented two options to improve the accessibility of past 
Commission decisions, noting that the CCSBT Compendium was available now 
for download from the private area of the website. 
86. Members agreed on the first option from paper CCSBT-EC/1610/11, which 
provided a text search facility on the CCSBT website that was considered a 
powerful method for locating past decisions and was considerably cheaper than 
the other option of providing a publicly searchable version of the Compendium 
on the website. 
Flag states/fishing entities to complete self-assessments of capacity with respect to 
national allocations. Flag State/fishing entity to take corrective action if required 
87. Regarding self-assessments of capacity with respect to national allocations: 
• South Africa noted its paper CCSBT-EC/1610/22 which reports the outcome 
of the self-assessment of its fishing capacity. 
• In response to questions, South Africa confirmed that all of its domestic and 
charter SBT vessels are operating within South Africa’s EEZ, and that these 
vessels also catch bigeye, yellowfin and swordfish; and the gear type used is 
deep-set longlines (monofilament). 
 
88. The European Union committed to providing a self-assessment of its fishing 
capacity in 2017.  The European Union clarified that with regard to its vessels 
that fish in areas where SBT are caught, they are targeting swordfish and that 
blue shark may be taken as bycatch.  In addition, the European Union reported 
that there have been no reported incidents of SBT bycatch in the past 3 years, and 
that the European Union’s capacity approximately matches its SBT quota 
allocation. 
Round table discussion on the Convention 
89. The European Union advised that it wished to seek Members’ views regarding 
the possibility to allow REIOs to become full Members of the CCSBT, and to 
provide feedback on the possibility of reviewing and amending the CCSBT 
Convention if necessary to allow full membership to the EU.   
90. Taiwan pointed out that the Action Plan of CCSBT’s Strategic Plan includes an 
action item to Develop mechanisms for extending full CCSBT Membership to 
Fishing Entities and REIOs (refer to 11.1(i)), and that this work is scheduled to 
be considered between 2018 and 2019. It continued that the Convention could 
remain without revising it if all Members believe that the EC functions well.  
91. Members did not support commencing the process of reviewing the Convention 
currently due to lack of necessity and other work priorities, however, some 
Members noted that they might be in a position to consider the European Union’s 
proposal in the future. 
92. The European Union indicated that this is an important matter for it because it is 
representing EU Member States and this is the practise of other RFMO’s and the 
European Union may initiate some bilateral communications intersessionally to 
discuss this matter further. 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Consideration of a CCSBT Fisheries Management Plan (FMP) 
93. The Secretariat presented paper CCSBT-EC/1610/12, which provided 
background information in relation to a CCSBT Fisheries Management Plan 
(FMP).  It was noted that CCSBT 22 supported the development of a FMP for the 
CCSBT and that it was agreed that New Zealand would develop a draft for 
consideration at CCSBT 24, if New Zealand had the resources. 
94. New Zealand advised that it hoped to have the resources to conduct this work 
during 2017.  New Zealand also noted, that given the work involved, it hoped the 
EC would give the FMP active consideration at CCSBT 24 if New Zealand is 
successful in producing a draft FMP. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Ecologically Related Species 
10.1 Resolution to Mitigate the Impact on Seabirds of Fishing for Southern 
Bluefin Tuna 
95. Australia presented paper CCSBT-EC/1610/19 which is a draft binding 
Resolution to Mitigate the Impact on Seabirds of Fishing for Southern Bluefin 
Tuna.  Australia remarked that it was concerned at the high level of seabird 
 
mortalities in the SBT fisheries and that a binding CCSBT measure is necessary.  
Australia further remarked that seabird mortalities by Japan’s SBT fleet increased 
from 2014 to 2015. Australia noted that the need to adopt the seabird resolution 
had been set out repeatedly, including by the ERSWG, and the CCSBT 
Performance Review. 
96. Japan supported the necessity to decrease seabird bycatch and noted that it had 
been making efforts in this regard.  It did not support a binding Resolution, and 
instead, was willing to support Australia’s proposal as a recommendation.  Japan 
noted that a binding Resolution could cause problems with inconsistencies 
occurring between CCSBT’s measure and current and future measures of other 
RFMO and that in any case, other RFMO measures are binding on Japan. 
97. Most Members supported adopting Australia’s draft Resolution providing that 
minor amendments were made to ensure that the Resolution is fully harmonised 
with those of ICCAT, IOTC and WCPFC. 
98. New Zealand noted that Members are obligated to follow the mitigation measures 
of the spatially based RFMOs, but supported CCSBT having its own rules and 
that these rules should be stronger measures than the spatially based RFMOs and 
they should be based on a risk management approach. 
99. Australia noted that the fishery need to be more directly accountable for its 
performance on seabird bycatch and that any inconsistencies could be resolved. 
100. HSI remarked that this is a central issue for the CCSBT as the fishery takes place 
in some of the highest risk area for albatrosses and that line weighting is an 
essential mitigation measure that should be mandated for use in these high risk 
areas. 
101. The EC directed the ERSWG, at its 2017 meeting, to specifically examine 
seabird bycatch mitigation measures currently in place in the ‘spatially-based’ 
RFMOs and the best available information on the distribution and population 
status of seabirds and provide advice to ESC22 and EC24 on whether these 
mitigation measures should be strengthened, and if they should be strengthened, 
how they should be strengthened. 
 
10.2 ERSWG Focus Topic 
102. The EC considered proposals for a specific focus topic to allow detailed technical 
discussions for the 2017 ERSWG meeting. Proposals from Members covered 
sharks, seabirds, and food-web related interactions. 
103. The EC considered that all of the proposed topics related to key areas under the 
ERSWG mandate and represented priority areas of the EC. 
104. The EC noted that principles for prioritisation of focus topics for the ERSWG 
could include 1) consideration of whether the topic was already being covered in 
detail by another RFMO or related fora; 2) CCSBT fisheries were a significant 
contributor to the topic; and 3) the topic would lead to addressing key 
management objectives of the EC. 
105. The EC could not agree that any of the proposed focus areas were more 
important than any other and therefore the EC specifically requested that the 
2017 ERSWG consider the following matters. 
 
• Seabirds 
o Review a global spatial seabird risk assessment. 
o Development of a multi-year strategy that identifies research, monitoring 
needs, and actions to reduce uncertainty and associated risks. 
o Discuss ways to improve seabird species identification. 
• Sharks 
o Review progress of the porbeagle shark assessment. 
o Review any risk assessment work undertaken by other RFMOs which might 
highlight priority shark species for which CCSBT fisheries may have an 
impact. 
o Consider approaches to reduce mortality on sharks, in particular unwanted 
shark catches. 
• Trophic interactions 
o Review of available data on SBT prey for both wild and farming SBT. 
o Discuss information on pelagic food webs. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Cooperating Non-Members 
106. There is only one Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) of the CCSBT, which is the 
Philippines.  The meeting noted that last year, the EC requested that the 
Philippines respond to questions from CCSBT and attend future meetings, which 
it has not done.  It was also noted that the Philippines had reported a nil catch for 
2015 and 2016 to date, as well as having no currently authorised fishing vessels.   
107. The CC has already recommended that the Executive Secretary send a letter to 
the Philippines to note that it has not renewed its commitment as a CCSBT 
CNM, and that its status as a CNM is in jeopardy. 
108. It was agreed that: 
• The CNM status of the Philippines be confirmed subject to the below 
conditions; 
• The Executive Secretary write and send a strongly worded letter to the 
Philippines requesting that it demonstrate its commitment to cooperate as a 
CCSBT CNM by undertaking actions such as responding to the Executive 
Secretary’s letter, providing reports as required, and attending meetings; 
• The Executive Secretary’s letter will specify a date by which the Philippines 
needs to respond, and outline that if no response is received by that date, then 
CCSBT Members will review the Philippines’ CNM status intersessionally (by 
Circular) and subsequently advise the Philippines of their decision with 
respect to this status. 
109. HSI noted that it may be useful if the CC develops a set of objective criteria 
specifying what is required in order to become a CNM and to retain CNM status. 
 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
110. Members discussed how to seek China’s cooperation with the CCSBT given the 
evidence of its involvement with SBT provided by the China market survey and 
reports of SBT found on board Chinese vessels. 
111. The EC agreed that the Executive Secretary would write to China on behalf of 
the CCSBT, seeking China’s cooperation by: 
• Inviting it to attend CC 12 and CCSBT 24; 
• Seeking its cooperating with the CCSBT’s CDS; 
• Requesting information in relation to the SBT catch and operation of the Fu 
Yuan Yu drift net vessels observed by “Sea Shepherd”; and 
• Requesting information concerning any other catches of SBT by Chinese 
flagged vessels. 
112. In order to encourage a response from China, the meeting suggested that the 
Executive Secretary visit the Chinese Embassy in Canberra to inform it of his 
letter.  Members were encouraged to contact China bilaterally to seek 
cooperation with CCSBT. 
113. The Secretariat introduced paper CCSBT-EC/1610/14 on CCSBT’s relationship 
with non-Members and advised that Fiji, Singapore and the United States had 
been invited to attend the meetings of the Compliance Committee and Extended 
Commission in 2016. The Secretariat pointed out that the USA has enhanced its 
cooperation with the CCSBT CDS and is now supplying documents to the 
Secretariat. 
114. The EC noted the contributions by the USA, and agreed that the Secretariat 
should repeat its invitations to China, Fiji, Singapore, and the USA for CC 12 
and CCSBT 24. 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Kobe Process 
115. The meeting noted paper CCSBT-EC/1610/15 which provides an update on 
CCSBT activities associated with the Kobe process. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
14.1. Reports from other RFMO meetings of interest  
116. The Chair introduced this item which is summarised in the Secretariat’s paper 
CCSBT-EC/1610/16 on activities with other organisations. 
117. The following reports were provided by Members as part of their Observer duties 
for the CCSBT: 
 
• Australia’s report (CCSBT-EC/1610/21) on the 34th Annual Meeting of the 
Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
(CCAMLR) held in Hobart, Australia between 19 Oct and 30 Oct 2015;  
• Indonesia’s report (CCSBT-EC/1610/25) on the 20th Session of the Indian 
Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) held in La Reunion, an overseas region and 
Department of France, between 23 and 27 May 2016;  
• Japan’s report (CCSBT-EC/1610/23) on the 24th Regular Meeting of the 
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) 
held in St. Julian’s, Malta between 10 and 17 November 2015; 
• Korea’s report (CCSBT-EC/1610/26) on the on 12th Annual Meeting of 
Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) held in Bali, 
Indonesia between 2 and 8 December 2015; and  
• Taiwan’s report (CCSBT-EC/1610/24) on the 90th Annual Meeting of the 
Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) held in La Jolla, 
California (USA) between 22 June and 1 July 2016. 
118. It was agreed the following Members would act as Observers to other RFMOs on 
behalf of CCSBT for 2016/17: 
• Australia to continue as Observer to CCAMLR; 
• Indonesia to continue as Observer to IOTC; 
• Japan to continue as Observer to ICCAT; 
• Korea to continue as Observer to WCPFC; and 
• Taiwan to continue as Observer to IATTC. 
 
14.2. Consideration of a draft Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) on 
exchange of data with the WCPFC 
119. The Secretariat introduced the draft Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) on 
exchange of data with the WCPFC at Attachment A of paper CCSBT-
EC/1610/16. The MoC was developed by the WCPFC and CCSBT Secretariats 
to facilitate the exchange of certain aggregated catch and effort data that are not 
in the public arena. 
120. It was noted that the WCPFC Technical and Compliance Committee had 
recommended the MoC to its Commission with one change. Japan advised the 
meeting that the change appended the following text to the end of paragraph 1(b) 
of the MoC:  
“in accordance with data access rules established by each Commission”. 
121. The EC endorsed the MoC including this modification. 
 
14.3. Attendance at the joint meeting of tuna RFMOs on the Implementation of 
Ecosystems Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) 
122. The EC agreed that the Chair of the ERSWG should represent the CCSBT at the 
EBFM meeting, and that he should also attend the related technical bycatch 
meeting if that proceeds. 
 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Confidentiality of Data and Documents 
15.1.   Confidentiality of reports and documents from 2016 
123. The Chair introduced paper CCSBT-EC/1610/17 on the confidentiality of reports 
and documents submitted as meeting documents during 2016.   
124. The meeting noted that all the reports of meetings and documents submitted to 
meetings under the jurisdiction of CCSBT 23 would be made publicly available 
with the following exceptions: 
• Attachment A of the Secretariat’s paper CCSBT-ESC/1609/04. 
• Australia’s papers CCSBT-ESC/1609/13 and CCSBT-CC/1610/BGD 03 and 
CCSBT-EC/1610/BGD 01 on a Japan Market Update. 
• Japan’s paper CCSBT-ESC/1609/BGD 07 on a review of SBT trade and 
monitoring research in Japanese domestic markets. 
• Japan’s papers CCSBT-ESC/1609/BGD 08 and CCSBT-CC/1610/22, which 
provide containing updates on monitoring of SBT tuna trading in the Japanese 
domestic market. 
• Tables 2-5 of paper CCSBT-CC/1610/BGD 02 from New Zealand and 
Australia, that provides updated estimates of IUU SBT catch by non-Members 
will be revised to show only total catch estimates. The revised version of the 
paper will be made publicly available. 
• Attachments B, C and D from paper CCSBT-CC/1610/10 are considered to be 
commercial-in-confidence and should remain confidential. 
• TRAFFIC’s papers CCSBT-ESC/1609/36 and CCSBT-CC/1610/20 as they 
are internal drafts and have yet to be cleared through TRAFFIC’s internal 
review procedures.  However, the meeting agreed that the final version of 
TRAFFIC’s papers could be made publicly available once it has cleared 
TRAFFIC’s internal review procedures. 
 
Agenda Item 16. 
Meeting for 2017 
125. It was agreed that the following meetings and dates would apply for 2017: 
• The 12th Meeting of the Ecologically Related Species Working Group, in 
Wellington, New Zealand from 21 - 24 March 2017. 
• An informal Operating Model and Management Procedure Technical meeting 
in Yogyakarta, Indonesia on 27 August 2017; 
• The 22nd Extended Scientific Committee meeting, in Yogyakarta, Indonesia  
from 28 August - 2 September 2017;  
• The 12th Compliance Committee Meeting, in Yogyakarta, Indonesia from

Indonesia from 9- 12 October 2017; and 
126. The Executive Secretary will determine suitable dates for a five-day 
intersessional OMMP meeting during 2017 after discussion with the scientists 
involved, in accordance with past practise for this meeting. 
 
 
Agenda Item 17. 
Election of Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended 
Commission of the 24th Annual Meeting of the CCCBT 
127. Indonesia advised that it will nominate the Chair of the Extended Commission of 
CCSBT 24 intersessionally.  The EU also advised that it will nominate its Vice-
Chair intersessionally.  The nominations will be provided to the Secretariat for 
distribution to Members. 
 
Agenda Item 18. 
Other Business 
128. The EC adopted the Resolution on large-scale driftnet fishing which is provided 
at Attachment 10. 
129. New Zealand presented a revised version of its proposed amendments to the 
Resolution on Establishing a List of Vessels Presumed to have Carried Out 
Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing Activities For Southern Bluefin 
Tuna (SBT), which allow the Executive Secretary to list a vessel on the draft IUU 
list on the basis of information from sources other than those provided by 
Members following an intersessional decision. 
130. The EC adopted the revised Resolution on Establishing a List of Vessels 
Presumed to have Carried Out Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing 
Activities For Southern Bluefin Tuna at Attachment 11. 
 
Agenda Item 19.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Good morning. 
Firstly, let me thank our hosts, the Government of Taiwan, for the warm welcome and 
for the great meeting venue. We also acknowledge the Secretariat for the meeting 
papers and arrangements, which are of the usual high standard. Some of our 
delegation took the opportunity yesterday to see some of Kaohsiung, which I 
understand is a wonderful city. 
It is with pleasure, and a little trepidation, that I have taken on the role of Australia’s 
CCSBT Commissioner. The Commission has a vital role managing southern bluefin 
tuna, and the fishery is of great importance to Australia. I know many of you have had 
a long association with the Commission, and I appreciate the warm welcome I have 
received and the support offered in meeting my new responsibilities. 
During this week’s meeting we have some very important business to conclude. 
There are some signs that stocks are rebuilding, but stocks remain critically low. We 
must continue to ensure we have sound processes in place to manage the stock and to 
continue rebuilding. 
The Commission's decision to end aerial surveys after 2017 means we must quickly 
develop and agree a new Management Procedure using an alternative recruitment 
index. This is important work: firstly, to ensure that our robust management 
arrangements continue; and secondly, to put in place a cheaper and simpler method to 
measure recruitment.  
The Extended Scientific Committee has laid out an ambitious path for us to develop 
the new Management Procedure and have it in place for the stock assessment that will 
determine catch levels for the three year quota block beginning in 2021. 
At this meeting we will consider catch levels not only for next year, but for the three 
year block from 2018 to 2020. We will need to account for catch of southern bluefin 
tuna outside the Commission's current management arrangements and discuss how we 
as Members are moving to better account for all our catch. For some, this may involve 
difficult choices; for Australia, we are determined to continue to meet all 
commitments made under the Convention. 
Our commitment is reflected very clearly in the many millions of dollars Australia has 
spent on scientific research to support the work of the Commission. As the 
Commission develops, we will keep playing our part, and continue to look for further 
sharing of science costs. 
For Australia¬-and many other Commission Members-our focus has been on 
recovering the southern bluefin tuna stock. We also recognise the need to take account 
of the fishery’s impacts on ecologically-related species, such as seabirds, sharks and 
sea turtles. The Commission's performance in this regard is coming under greater 
scrutiny and we must maintain its hard-earned reputation as a leading international 
fisheries management organisation. Australia will once again seek your agreement to 
a resolution on minimising seabird mortalities while fishing for southern bluefin tuna. 
I sincerely hope that all Members can support this resolution. 
Finally, let me again thank our Taiwanese hosts and assure you all that Australia will 
keep working constructively and cooperatively with all Members, to ensure the 
Extended Commission achieves its important tasks - this week and beyond. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the European Union 
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
The EU Delegation is very happy to be present at the 23rd Annual Meeting of 
CCSBT. We would also like first of all to thank Taiwan for the very warm welcome 
and for hosting the annual meeting in this beautiful city. We would also like to thank 
the Secretariat for the preparatory work. 
The EU is a major fishing player and producer with vessels in all oceans and an active 
member of the large majority of RFMOs worldwide and being the world’s largest 
importer of fish and fish products, consuming about 25 % of the world’s fish 
resources in value, and imports 70 % of its consumption.   
However in CCSBT, the EU has limited direct interest either in terms of catches or 
imports. Notwithstanding, the EU continues to be strongly committed to ensuring 
compliance with conservation and management measures and is engaged in 
supporting scientific activities in CCSBT contributing to the sound management of 
the Southern Bluefin Tuna stock.  
This year, we are particularly interested in the discussions on the Total Allowable 
Catch (TAC) for 2017 and the TAC block for 2018-2020 but also on the decision of a 
number of proposals for conservation and management measures, notably the measure 
to mitigate the impact of SBT fisheries on seabirds, revise the CCSBT Catch 
Documentation Scheme (CDS) and update compliance resolutions following 
Compliance Committee discussions.  
In addition, we believe that by revisiting the recommendations of the 2014 
Performance Review regarding the implementation of the Compliance Action Plan 
this will contribute to improving the level of compliance within CCSBT. 
Finally, we have also good expectations on the way forward regarding the 
implementation of the CCSBT Strategic Plan, including aspects related to 
confidentiality of fishing data, chairing arrangements, funding sources and 
international cooperation.  
To conclude, I would like to underline our willingness to work constructively and co-
operatively with all CCSBT Contracting Parties and Cooperating non-Contracting 
Parties this week, in order to finish on a successful and positive note on Thursday. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Mr. Chair, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, Good morning. 
On behalf of the Taiwan delegation, I would like to welcome the Chairs of the 
Extended Scientific Committee and the Compliance Committee, the Secretariat, 
colleagues from other delegations and observers from the Humane Society 
International (HSI), and the TRAFFIC to Taiwan. Besides, I would also like to take 
this opportunity to welcome the European Union, South Africa accession and the 
European Union’s to the Extended Commission of the CCSBT.  
Furthermore, I would like to extend our appreciation to the Executive Secretary, Mr. 
Kennedy, and his staff for preparing all the meeting documents and all sorts of 
logistics for the meeting.  
One of the very important tasks for this meeting is to decide the global total allowable 
catch (TAC) for 2018-2020. Based on the result of running MP this year, the 
Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) recommended the annual TAC for the years 
2018-2020 is 17,647 tons. It increases 3,000 tons compared with the current TAC. 
This is a very inspiring outcome for us. It means that we are on the right track by 
using MP to rebuild the resources of southern bluefin tuna.  
On the other hand, we also noted that the unaccounted catch mortality, such as Non-
cooperating Non-members’ catches remains to be uncertain. Therefore, we still need 
to be cautious.  
With respect to monitoring, control, and surveillance (MCS) measures adopted by the 
CCSBT, it includes records of authorized vessels and farms, vessel monitoring system 
(VMS), transhipment program, Catch documentation scheme (CDS), and illegal, 
unreported and unregulated (IUU) vessel list. All these measures are very crucial to 
monitor the compliance of Members and Cooperating Non-members’ SBT catch from 
capture/harvest to the first point of sale so as to ensure the global TAC not to be 
overused. Besides, monitoring non-member’s SBT catch and obtaining substantially 
improved information on unaccounted mortality (UAM) remains a priority.   
In closing, I look forward to working with all Members in the following days to 
achieve positive outcomes for the sustainability of SBT fishery. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
Very good morning all delegates, 
Firstly, on behalf of Indonesia delegation, we would like to thank Taiwan for hosting 
the Extended Commission of the 23rd Annual Meeting of the Commission in this 
beautiful city of Kaohsiung.  I would like also to extend our appreciation to Robert 
Kennedy as Executive Secretary and the CCSBT Secretariat Staff for their excellent 
effort to organize this meeting.  
Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
At the 22nd CCSBT Commission Meeting, we reported that Indonesia has established 
a National Quota Allocation Distribution which has been legalized under Directorate 
General of Capture Fisheries Decision No.62/2015 and it put in place since fishing 
season 2015 (January-December). This scheme was developed in accordance with the 
recommendation from QAR. Under this scheme, we will be able to maintain the total 
SBT catch not exceeding the national quota we have.  
As we have reported to CCSBT 11st Compliance Committee Meeting last week, the 
total SBT catch in 2015 is 5,944 individuals or equivalent to 593 in Mt, against our 
national quota 750 Mt.  Most of SBT was harvested from Indonesia Fisheries 
Management Area 573 as part of CCSBT Statistical Area Number 1.   
There are 422 Vessels were authorized to catch for SBT, consist of 2 vessel categories 
such as vessel greater than 30 GT is 254 vessels and vessel 30 GT and Less, is 168 
vessels. And 112 vessels out of 422 vessels (26.5%) harvested SBT compose of 35 
Vessels greater than 30 GT with total catch 3.203 individual or equivalent to about 
301 Mt (50.7%) and 77 vessel 30 GT and less, with total catch 2,741 individuals or 
equivalent about 292 Mt (49.3%). In Indonesia tuna fisheries, SBT is considered as 
non-target species or as by-catch, and it may be reflected from total SBT catch/vessel 
is average only 4.5 individual/month. But due to the implementation of quota 
allocation, there is a change in the operation of those vessels. 
Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
As we do understand that at this Extended Commission Meeting of the 23rd Annual 
Meeting of the Commission, Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for 2018-2020 will be 
discussed and set up. In relation to that, I would like to reiterate this Commission 
Meeting regarding the Indonesia proposal was submitted to the Extended Commission 
Meeting of the 20th Annual Meeting of the Commission in 2013 to revisit our 
national quota, since current quota allocation was too low in relation to number of 
vessels involved in this fishery, which has a long history catching SBT. Even though 
discussion on this issue has been made at the 20th, 21st and 22nd of the Commission 
Meeting but consensus has not been reached yet. As we noted from the previous year 
discussion, it is required that Indonesia could demonstrate its capacity to control the 
national total catch of SBT.  And as we have mentioned earlier that since fishing year 
2015 (January-December), the quota allocation scheme is already in place, effectively 
implemented and enforced, and as a result, there was no over-catches occurred. We do 
committed to keep implementing this scheme in the future.  
Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
By additional Indonesia national quota as we proposed as much as 300 Mt/year, we 
would like to confirm that Indonesia is ready to apply the Corrective Action Policy 
without exemption as described in Para 23 of the Report of the Eight Meeting of The 
Compliance Committee. We are ready to apply the payback on 1:1 basis, if over-catch 
occurred in the future. We wish to be equally treated as other members of this 
commission.  
We therefore very much appreciate any cooperative spirit made by the commission 
members to this issue, by considering at least 3 aspects such as (i) Para 78 of the 
Report of the Twenty Second Annual Meeting of the Commission stipulates that the 
best opportunity to seek an increase in allocation will be when the TAC for the 2018-
2020 quota block is allocated in 2016 and (ii) Para 172 of Report of the 21st Meeting 
of the Scientific Committee that the recommended Annual TAC from the result of the 
MP for the years 2018-2020 is 17,647 ton (increase 3,000 ton from 14,647 ton TAC 
2017) and (iii) Article 8 Para 4 (c) of The Convention for the Conservation of 
Southern Blue fin Tuna, stipulates that “In deciding upon allocations among the 
Parties under Paragraph 3 above, the Commission shall consider the interest of Parties 
through whose exclusive economic or fishery zones southern Bluefin tuna migrates”.  
And there is no doubt that SBT migrates within Indonesia Fisheries Management 
Area 573. 
Finally, I would like to extend my greatest appreciation once again to member’s 
consideration and sympathy for Indonesia position in this regards. 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by Japan 
 
Good morning. On behalf of the Japanese Delegation I would like to extend our 
greetings to the Chairperson and to all the participants. 
First of all, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to Taiwan for hosting this 
meeting in Kaohsiung. 
I recognize that the port of Kaohsiung is a leading trading port in Asia and the largest 
base of Taiwan’s tuna fishery.  While directly feeling the atmosphere of the city 
possessing the biggest port of Taiwan, and while having delicious “Dim Sum” in 
Taiwanese “Yum cha” style, I would like to enjoy our stay here in Kaohsiung. 
I would also like to thank the Executive Secretary, Mr. Kennedy and the staff of the 
CCSBT Secretariat for their excellent work in organizing this meeting, as well as the 
interpreters who do always a wonderful job. 
Furthermore, I also take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome again to the 
European Union that joined the Extended Commission last year and to the Republic of 
South Africa that has become a member of the CCSBT this year. 
Let me touch upon my personal experience with the CCSBT. I was in charge of the 
CCSBT issues in the Fisheries Agency of Japan from 1994 to 1996, which is the 
initial period after the Convention entered into force. I still clearly remember a heated 
discussion among members at that time due to the concerns about the condition of 
SBT resources. This year, I am coming back here as Japanese Commissioner, and I 
have heard that the operation of the Commission has been significantly improved as 
the SBT stock has continued to recover. 
Five years have already passed since the advanced and transparent method for TAC 
decision through the Management Procedure (MP) was introduced in the CCSBT.  
Last year, we agreed to revise the current MP to improve its feasibility.  At this 
meeting, we need to set the next TAC for 2018 to 2020, taking account of the latest 
stock assessment by the ESC.  According to the 2011 resolution adopted when MP 
was introduced, the allocations of all Members at that time shall be first returned to 
their nominal catch levels.  Then, we need to agree on the allocations of all current 
Members, including newly joined Members. 
Finally, at the beginning of this important meeting, I would like to touch upon the 
premise of our future direction that we should move towards.  There is no question 
that the accurate information and compliance are fundamental to the precise stock 
assessment and the proper fisheries management.  I would like to stress that each 
member and cooperating non-member must include their all sources of mortality in 
their allocation according to the definition of attributable catch and the schedule that 
we agreed in the past.  Furthermore, the Commission should not only grasp the catch 
level of non-members clearly, but also make steady progress on uncertain fishery 
which has been a long-term concern among us. 
In closing, I am looking forward to having a constructive discussion among all 
participants more than ever before and I hope we are able to make an important step 
for the future development of the CCSBT through this four day discussion. 
Thank you, Chairperson.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa. Ngā mihi nui ki a koutou 
 
On behalf of the New Zealand delegation I would like to firstly thank our host Taiwan 
for its welcome and the pleasant excursion that was provided yesterday.  It was both 
entertaining and enlightening and provided an opportunity for us to reflect on the 
origins of the people of the Pacific community of which New Zealand is a part.   
I would also like to again extend our thanks to the Secretariat for its work throughout 
the year and our greetings to other delegations and meeting participants.  In particular 
New Zealand would like to greet new members South Africa and the European Union 
and also the new Commissioners from a number of members.  Welcome to the dance 
floor. 
New Zealand has been looking forward to the meeting this week as we as a 
Commission are on the cusp of becoming a leader among RFMOs.  Notably the 
decisions at this meeting will determine the global TAC and national allocations for 
2018 to 2020. Within those national allocations members have committed to fully 
account for all sbt mortality attributable to them. A significant step forward. Further, 
for the first time CCSBT members have committed to formally take account of non-
member catch with the global TAC. 
It appears we are riding on the crest of a series of good recruitments to the fishery and 
it is hard to ignore some of the extremely positive indicators from the stock. The 
advice from our scientists indicates that a further increase in the global TAC is 
consistent with the parameters in the Management Procedure. However, New Zealand 
does note and reiterate the caveats associated with that advice. We cannot claim to be 
a science based organisation and then ignore the science. 
New Zealand has clear expectations that members will honour their commitments to 
account for all sbt mortalities within the global TAC and national allocations. New 
Zealand has little sympathy for prevarication and lack of action based on uncertain 
information.  We can always benefit from further research however at this time we 
must act on the best information we have available and if that information is uncertain 
our decisions must be precautionary. We cannot let uncertain information be a reason 
for postponing action. 
On a final note we have come to the view that it is timely to review the parameters 
associated with the Management Procedure, specifically the target of 20% of the 
spawning biomass by 2035. As a Commission we knew at the time the Management 
Procedure was adopted that the target was not ambitious but it was necessary to reach 
agreement given the uncertainty about how quickly we would see a response to the 
management measures we introduced.  
 
During the upcoming review of the Management Procedure we should give serious 
consideration to banking some of the gains we have received from a series of good 
recruitment.  The stock remains in a vulnerable state and New Zealand considers that 
adopting a more ambitious management target will provide for a more rapid rebuild 
and for stability for the future. 
This Commission has made considerable progress in recent years but we must work 
hard to maintain our reputation as a credible and forward thinking regional 
management organisation.  Living up to our commitments, cooperation and 
transparent information exchange will assist us in meeting this challenge. 
Attachment 4 – 7 
 
Opening Statement by Republic of Korea 
 
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen. 
On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Korea, I would like to express our 
sincere appreciation to Taiwan for hosting the 23rd session of the Extended 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in this beautiful marine 
city of Kaohsiung with their warm hospitality.  And I would also like to extend my 
thanks to Executive Secretary, Mr. Robert Kennedy, his staff and local organizers for 
preparing and supporting this meeting.  And I would like to further extend our 
gratitude to the Chairs of subsidiary bodies for their hard works for this Commission. 
Mr. Chairman, the Republic of Korea is firmly committed itself to abide by the 
conservation and management measures adopted by CCSBT and other related tuna-
RFMOs in order to ensure the sustainable use of tuna resources.  Thanks to the efforts 
made so far by the Extended Commission and all members, and supportive 
stakeholders as well, the SBT stock has been showing good signs in terms of the 
planned stock recovery since the effective implementation of the Management 
Procedure in 2011.  
When I look back to the side of Korea, there has been an improvement in a range of 
areas in science and MCS. In science, scientific data exchange, CPUE standardization 
and cooperative studies with members have been substantially enhanced with capacity 
of scientists.  The QAR phase 2 on-site inspection conducted this year reported that 
the Korea’s SBT management systems are effective in terms of the CCSBT minimum 
performance requirements for SBT and ERS, with some potential weaknesses.  With 
regard to the weakness, Korea has already recognized and established the 
improvement plans to mitigate and will continue to strive to address the areas of risk 
in the MCS.  
Mr. Chairman, this year we are assigned many important tasks under your 
chairmanship.  One of them is to confirm the TAC for 2017 in relation to exceptional 
circumstances.  Second one is to consider and endorse the TAC for the next three 
years, 2018-2020.  Last one is to set the level of non-member’s catch with which 
allocation to Members and Cooperating Non-Members to be adjusted.  Among these 
tasks, Korea has concern about a level of unreported direct catch of SBT by non-
members, although the CCSBT and other RFMOs where the SBT migrates have been 
implementing the conservation and management measures to fight against IUU 
activities.  Korea would like to encourage all the members of the Extended 
Commission to make every effort to eradicate these direct illegal catch of SBT as a 
matter of urgent priority.  This is newly emerged challenge to keep the reputation of 
our CCSBT as a leading and exemplary regional fisheries management organization 
for tuna and tuna-like species. 
Before closing, I look forward to productive and successful outcomes for the 
conservation and sustainable use of SBT stock based on our cooperation among 
members, cooperating non-member and stakeholders.

Opening Statement by Republic of South Africa 
 
Chairperson,   
Executive Secretary,   
Esteemed Members, Delegates and Observers, all Protocol observed.   
On behalf of the South African Delegation, I would like to extend our sincere 
gratitude and appreciation to the Government of Taiwan for hosting this 23rd Annual 
Meeting of the Extended Commission of the Commission for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) in the beautiful City of Kaohsiung. I would also like 
to extend a word of thanks and appreciation to the Executive Secretary, as well as all 
the Secretariat staff for the excellent preparations and arrangements for this meeting.    
After so many years, this is a watershed moment for the Republic of South Africa to 
be sitting around the table with all other members of the CCSBT as an equal partner. 
I'm not sure if it is befitting for me as an official to be the one expressing this 
gratitude on behalf of the Republic of South Africa.   
Chairperson, the Republic of South Africa's commitment to the Regional Fisheries 
Management Organisations (RFMOs) is unquestionable. We are one of the founding 
members of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and 
the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, we are a 
very active member in South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation and since 2003, the 
Republic of South Africa participated in the Commission as a Cooperating Non-
Member of the CCSBT.    
It has been a very long road to freedom, eight years to be precise, the process of 
accession started in 2008. Be that as it may, during its house seating on the 3rd of 
September 2015, the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa finally approved 
South Africa’s accession to the CCSBT. Ladies and Gentlemen, we are proud to also 
announce to Member States, Delegates and Observers, that the Republic of South 
Africa has also acceded to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and has ratified the 
Food and Agriculture Organization’s Port State Measures.   
As a newly admitted Member of the Extended Commission, there is an added 
expectation for the Republic of South Africa to adhere to all the Conservation and 
Management measures of the CCSBT, including but not limited to data reporting. I 
am aware that South Africa has in the past not attended some of the CCSBT meetings, 
and has in some other instances not submitted required information or data in time.    
In an effort to improve South Africa’s compliance to the CCSBT, we are in the 
process of setting up a dedicated unit that will be responsible for all RFMO related 
activities, including but not limited to data or information reporting. Chairperson, our 
newly found status will see improved participation and commitment throughout 
Committees and subcommittees of the CCSBT.    
South Africa will endeavour to adhere to all the applicable Conservation and 
Management measures as adopted by the CCSBT. It is against this background that a 
detailed review of the fisheries and related national legislation of the Republic of 
South Africa was undertaken to ensure that South Africa’s legal framework is 
adequate to implement the Conservation and Management measures adopted by the 
various RFMOs that South Africa is a Member party to. The Department’s Legal team 
is currently studying the report and will soon be engaging with key stakeholders in 
order to address any identified inconsistencies or legislative gaps.   
Ladies and Gentlemen, it is important to bring the following to your attention, that the 
Republic South Africa's Marine Living Resources are managed under a very strong 
piece of legislation called Marine Living Resources Act. With clear objectives and I 
will only name a few, such as:   
1. the need to achieve optimum utilisation and ecologically sustainable development 
of marine living resources;  
2. the need to conserve marine living resources for both present and future 
generations;  
3. the need to apply precautionary approaches in respect of the management and 
development of marine living resources;  
4. the need to protect the ecosystem as a whole, including species which are not 
targeted for exploitation;   
5. the need to preserve marine biodiversity;  
6. the need to minimise marine pollution;   
In line with Marine Living Resources Act and other Departmental policies 
promulgated thereunder, South Africa is currently busy with the allocation of new 
fishing rights in the Tuna Longline fishing. We have intention of growing this sector 
as we believe, it has a massive potential in addressing our Government’s key strategic 
objectives of alleviating poverty and creating jobs through allocation of sizeable and 
viable Total Allowable Catch.    
The Republic of South Africa will continue to strengthen our relationship with the 
CCSBT Secretariat and other important stakeholders to achieve both our 
Government’s and CCSBT’s objectives. We will always be reliant on your support 
and we will continue to work with you and all other all the Members and Cooperating 
Non-Members in exchanging of information and data. Together we can do more. 
I thank you. 
Attachment 5 – 1 
 
Opening Statement by Humane Society International 
 
Humane Society International would like to thank the Commission for the opportunity 
to participate, once again, as an observer to these important deliberations. As at 
previous CCSBT Commission meetings, HSI continues to hope that, with a 
Management Procedure for SBT adopted, there is an opportunity for the Commission 
to focus more on the problem of unacceptably high levels of bycatch of Ecologically 
Related Species, especially of albatross and petrel species nesting on sub-Antarctic 
islands.  
We consider that any proposals for SBT TAC increases based on the Management 
Procedure should be deferred until effective and enforceable seabird bycatch 
measures are in place – and implemented.  Remember, that for every two tonnes of 
SBT TAC increase for longliners, at least one more albatross will be killed – this is an 
exceptional circumstance warranting immediate remedy. 
We are alarmed at evidence from observer information in Members’ national reports 
that albatross bycatch is increasing despite entry into force of mitigation measures by 
other tuna RFMOs.  Frustratingly, this comes as no surprise to HSI, given the 
weaknesses in those measures and the inadequacies of their reporting and compliance 
arrangements.  
So, we urge CCSBT Members to adopt their own seabird bycatch mitigation measure 
– at this meeting - based on the Australian proposal which is consistent with, but goes 
beyond, those adopted by the four other tuna RFMOs. The key requirement is to 
mandate the exclusive use of appropriately weighted longlines not only to minimise 
seabird mortalities but also to aid effective compliance and enforcement action.  
Greater efforts must be made, by CCSBT and its Member and Observer States, to get 
a better picture of seabird bycatch in this fishery, to understand where, how and why 
such high levels of mortality are still occurring.  Log books need to identify, for each 
gear set, what mitigation arrangements were used, and how many of what species of 
ERS, were killed or harmed.  This is needed to compare observed and unobserved 
fishing effort to get a reliable estimate of overall bycatch mortality. 
In particular, it is important that rates of observer coverage are increased to at least 
25%, and observer protocols suitably amended, until the fishery can demonstrate the 
ability to reduce bycatch to near-zero levels.  Again, we remind Members that 
CCAMLR continues to achieve near zero albatross mortality – we all know what can 
and should be done.  
Additionally, HSI is concerned at the inability of the Compliance Committee to 
recognise the exceptional circumstance, created by the high likelihood of high levels 
of non-member catch of SBT, not only for the sake of target stock recovery but also 
out of concern for likely high levels of seabird bycatch in such unauthorised SBT 
fishing.  We are particularly concerned at the reluctance of some delegations to 
acknowledge and effectively respond to the likely serious scale and extent of IUU and 
non-member fishing out of concern for their expectations of increases in SBT quotas.  
We note that such reluctance to come to grips with IUU fishing is inconsistent with 
the well-know public positions of their governments. 
On a final and more positive note, HSI is delighted to note ongoing progress towards 
adoption of a stock assessment approach based on estimating all sources of mortality 
attributable to Members and non-members alike.  Such estimates will inevitably have 
variable levels of confidence attached to them and we urge Members not to delay in 
the hope of making more confident estimates later.  We appreciate Members’ 
concerns over estimating recreational, artisanal and local community catches and urge 
Members to accept lower levels of confidence for such estimates compared to those 
from well-regulated commercial fisheries – the precautionary principle admonishes us 
not to use lack of information to justify delay.  
Thank you Chair and Members for your time. 
Attachment 5 – 2 
 
Opening Statement by TRAFFIC 
 
Thank you Mr Chairman. 
We would like to thank Taiwan for hosting this meeting in the vibrant harbour capital 
of Kaohsiung. TRAFFIC would also like to thank the Commission for the opportunity 
to participate as an observer to meetings of the Extended Commission and its other 
subsidiary bodies. We look forward to contributing to these critical deliberations. 
TRAFFIC welcomes indications that the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) stock is 
showing signs of higher recruitment. This reflects well on efforts of the Commission, 
but we remain concerned with the status of the stock and believe a cautious approach 
to the stock assessment, Management Procedure (MP) and setting of the Total 
Allowable Catch (TAC) is needed. 
While the annual TAC has increased in recent years, the stock is estimated to still be 
at an extremely low level – approximately 9% of the initial Spawning Stock Biomass, 
well below the level considered to be biologically safe. We ask the Commission to 
make every effort to minimize the uncertainties and data gaps affecting the Operating 
Model and increase the probability of reaching the rebuilding target. This will require 
greater attention to ensuring CCSBT members are complying with both catch and 
trade regulations of the Commission. We encourage the Commission to scrutinise 
catch and trade data records of the CCSBT Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS), 
FAO catch production, UN Comtrade and Customs to assess consistency, and to 
highlight any identified discrepancies. 
Unaccounted mortality catch remains an important issue due to under-reporting by 
Members, discarding, Non-Member catch and recreational catch. We urge the 
Commission to collect information and data on the unaccounted mortalities, especially 
by Nom-members, and be precautionary by taking this data into consideration when 
setting a TAC for 2018-2020.  
Considering the importance of independent sources of fishery information in order for 
the MP to be seen as an objective and responsible management system, TRAFFIC 
urges the Commission to allocate adequate funding for the gene tagging method. Data 
generated through this initiative can be used as a satisfactory abundance estimate. 
With respect to Ecologically Related Species (ERS), we encourage the Commission to 
instruct the Scientific Committee to consider the prioritisation of research and 
management for shark and ray species. In early 2017 at the ERS meeting, the stock 
assessment of Porbeagle shark will be considered and we believe the Scientific 
Committee should provide advice to the Commission if management measures are 
required. Last week at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the silky shark, 
three thresher sharks and nine devil rays were added to Appendix II of CITES joining 
the Porbeagle shark and a number of other shark species within the appendices. This 
has implications for CCSBT Members who are catching and trading these species. We 
encourage the Commission to ask the ERS and Scientific Committee to review the 
extent to which CCSBT Members are catching CITES listed species and make 
recommendations to the next Commission on any management or research required 
for these species, particularly in regard to assisting Members in having the required 
information needed to issue relevant CITES permits and certificates. We would also 
like to note that during the CITES meeting some CCSBT Members, including Japan, 
repeatedly said it was the RFMOs that should take responsibility for shark and ray 
management and we therefore look forward to their support in securing such action 
within CCSBT. 
TRAFFIC urges Members to make the necessary decisions, with the required sense of 
urgency, in order to effectively conserve SBT and other ERS, especially sharks, 
seabirds and marine turtles.  
As a final note to the Commissioners, we ask that this week the plenary of the 
Commission remains the forum for discussions and decisions so that we can all 
participate, thus ensuring that the CCSBT process can be open and transparent.  
Thank you, Mr Chairman. 
Attachment 6 
 
Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
Dominic Vallières (New Zealand) agreed to chair the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC). The FAC was tasked with the following agenda: 
• Revision of the 2016 budget 
• Draft 2017 budget 
• Indicative budgets for 2018 and 2019 
 
The revised budget for 2016 
The Executive Secretary gave a summary of the 2016 revised budget outlined in 
CCSBT-EC/1610/05. The revision incorporates actual income and expenditure as at 
31 August 2016 together with forecast income and expenditure for the remainder of 
the year. 
The Executive Secretariat raised a number of corrections in relation to meeting 
expenses in the scientific program which had been previously overestimated. The 
FAC endorsed the corrections and also agreed to reduce the number of participants for 
the upcoming joint EBFM meeting electing to only fund the Chair of the ERS 
working group. The latter change resulted in additional savings of $5,000. The 
Executive Secretariat was also able to advise the FAC that the $10,000 previously 
budgeted for the translation of meeting documents at this year’s EC had not been 
required. Following the changes, total revised expenditures were 1.5% less than 
previously budgeted. 
The two forecast expenditures with a significant increase over the approved budget 
are those related to the Phase 2 QAR of Korea and the delayed Chinese market 
research. The expenses for the Chinese market research had been budgeted for the 
previous year and were carried forward as part of this year’s income. However, the 
decision to conduct the Phase 2 QAR of Korea came after budget adoption and was 
therefore not part of the initially budgeted expenditures for 2016. 
Improved returns from the Secretariat’s investment ($24,100) and the Staff 
Assessment Levy ($1,616) along with the earlier-mentioned carry-forward from 
research not completed in the previous year ($71,400) provided additional income to 
that previously budgeted.  This additional income along with the reduced expenditures 
described above mean that the Commission is no longer required to make its 
previously budgeted withdrawal from savings.  
A surplus of $13,709 is now estimated for 2016, and it is proposed that this surplus be 
carried forward as income into the 2017 budget, in accordance with CCSBT’s 
Financial Regulations. 
The FAC thanked the Executive Secretary for the work done on the budget.  
The FAC recommends that the revised budget for 2016 at Annex A be agreed by the 
Extended Commission. 
 
The draft budget for 2017 and indicative budgets for 2018 and 2019 
The FAC considered the proposed budgets outlined in CCSBT-EC/1610/06. The draft 
2017 budget was revised to reflect outcomes of the Compliance Committee meeting 
and an agreement by Japan to extend the current secondment of the Deputy Executive 
Secretary for an additional year.  
The addition of South Africa to the EC created excess contributions from all other 
members in the previous year and those contributions now stand as an advance 
towards those members’ future contributions. Details of the individual member 
advances are provided in table 1. 
Table 1:

Members of the FAC were asked for their views on a proposal put forward by the 
Executive Secretary that those advances be deferred to the 2019 to avoid a larger 
increase in that year. The FAC supported this proposal with the understanding that 
funds would remain in trust with the Secretariat and that any gains accrued over that 
time would be part of the Commission’s wider returns on investments. 
Expenditures for the 2017 budget were also discussed in the Commission and the 
FAC and the following changes were made to the budget (changes shown here are 
those where the value of changes was greater than $3,000): 
• The FAC supported the recommendations of the Compliance Committee to 
allocate $10,000 ($30,000 over 3 years) towards compliance support for the 
Secretariat and forego the $30,000 study on improved data collection systems. 
• Expenditures for website enhancements were also reduced to $1,400 to reflect 
decisions made at this year’s Commission meeting. 
• Reduction in costs of the OMMP Technical Meeting based on shorter 
duration. 
• Recruitments expenses of $87,000 for the replacement of the Deputy 
Executive Secretary are deferred to 2018. 
Recommended Budget 2017 
The FAC recommends the General Budget for the Extended Commission in 2017 as 
set out in Annex B to this document.  
 
 
Indicative Budgets for 2018 and 2019 
As with the previous year, the FAC was asked to also consider indicative budgets for 
the two years beyond the upcoming budget.  Members of the FAC thoroughly 
examined the indicative budgets and made a number of changes to refine estimates 
where possible as well as look for potential savings that could be made. 
South Africa announced that it was willing to cover the costs of venue hire and 
catering associated with hosting of the Compliance Committee and Extended 
Commission meetings in 2019.  This change resulted in savings of $55,500 to the 
indicative 2019 budget. Members thanked South Africa for its generosity in making 
this additional contribution. 
Adjustments were also made to the recruitment costs in 2018; those changes reflect 
the one-year extension to the current Deputy Executive Secretary. 
Reflecting recommendations found within the most recent ESC report, the FAC also 
discussed potential funding of the aerial survey beyond 2017. Members recognised 
the risks involved in foregoing future aerial survey results but also noted that the 
current financial constraints of the Commission were such that funding the survey 
beyond 2017 was not possible. The FAC also noted the comments from the Executive 
Secretary that funding would need to be secured before June of 2017 in order to meet 
the logistical demands of the survey. A number of Members suggested that alternative 
sources of funding could be explored but recognised that without those additional 
contributions the work could not continue.  
The FAC also noted the three-year workplan provided by the ESC and the resources 
required to undertake the work. A copy of this workplan is included at Annex C. 
The indicative 2018 and 2019 budgets will significantly draw upon previous savings 
of the Commission which reflects a decision of CCSBT22.  In doing so, the FAC was 
able to limit the increases in Member contributions to below the agreed target of 10% 
in both those years.  However, this does not take into account changes in required 
contributions in accordance with the CCSBT contribution formula that will arise for 
any Member that receives a change in its nominal allocation. 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission note the proposed changes to 
the indicative 2018 and 2019 budgets and the attached ESC workplan (Annex C).

Streamlining CCSBT Subsidiary Body Chairing Arrangements 
Background 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) has a number of 
Subsidiary Bodies, see Annex 1. By nature of the roles, the chairing arrangements for each 
body vary. At CCSBT22, the Extended Commission agreed to develop common standards for 
the appointment and length of tenure for all chairs of CCSBT subsidiary bodies. Australia 
volunteered to prepare draft chairing arrangements for subsidiary bodies to provide greater 
consistency across all chairs. This paper builds on CCSBT Circular #2016-046 which 
proposed arrangements for the Scientific and Extended Scientific Committees.  
 
Current and proposed chairing arrangements 
It is expected that the chair of subsidiary bodies will act with independence at all times, 
regardless of employment or nationality. The following tables present the current chairing 
arrangements for CCSBT subsidiary bodies and propose options for future arrangements. The 
proposed options impose no new costs on the Commission.

Technical Working Groups 
The Catch Per Unit Effort Working Group and Operating Model and Management Procedure 
Technical Meeting, chaired by Independent Scientific Panel members, are highly technical 
working groups of the Extended Scientific Committee. They are not established under the 
CCSBT convention nor created by the Extended Commission. The Independent Scientific 
Panel’s engagement in leading these working groups has been critical to the Extended 
Scientific Committee’s processes. This paper separates these two working groups from the 
other subsidiary bodies and does not propose any changes to their chairing arrangements.

Process for appointments 
As with the process outlined in Circular #2016-046, the following process could be used, for 
similar (ie. Compliance Committee, Ecologically Related Species) appointments: 
1. Secretariat confirms process and timing of process by circular (or at meeting as 
required) 
2. Secretariat calls for nominations by circular (and advertises as appropriate) 
3. Secretariat distributes nominees’ applications to members to rank 
4. Secretariat tallies votes 
5. Successful candidate is notified 
6. Members notified of successful candidate 
 
Recording agreed changes 
Currently, the CCSBT Terms of Reference for Subsidiary Bodies document only details terms 
of reference and chairing arrangements for Compliance Committee, Ecologically Related 
Species Working Group and Standing Committee for Finance and Administration. This 
document is an appropriate and accessible document to record the agreed chairing 
arrangements for future reference.

Resolution on large-scale driftnet fishing 
(Adopted at the Twenty Third Annual Meeting – 10-13 October 2016)  
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
Recalling that the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 46/215 calls 
for a global moratorium on large-scale high seas driftnet fishing; 
Noting that a number of vessels continue to engage in high seas driftnet fishing 
affecting the southern bluefin tuna fishery; 
Concerned that any vessel fishing with large-scale driftnets on the high seas in a 
manner which can reasonably be expected to result in the catching, taking or 
harvesting of southern bluefin tuna is likely to undermine the effectiveness of CCSBT 
Conservation and Management Measures; 
Agrees in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8, that 
1. The use of large-scale driftnets1 on the high seas in a manner which can
reasonably be expected to result in the catching, taking or harvesting of southern
bluefin tuna is prohibited.
2. Members and CNMs shall take all measures necessary to prohibit their fishing
vessels from using large-scale driftnets in contravention of operative paragraph 1
of this resolution.
3.
Nothing in this resolution shall prevent Members and CNMs from applying more
stringent measures to regulate the use of large-scale driftnets.
1 ‘Large-scale driftnets’ are defined as gillnets or other nets or a combination of nets that are more than 
2.5 kilometres in length whose purpose is to enmesh, entrap, or entangle fish by drifting on the surface 
of, or in, the water column. 
Attachment 11 
Resolution on Establishing a List of Vessels Presumed to have Carried Out 
Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing Activities For Southern Bluefin 
Tuna (SBT) 
(revised at the 23rd Annual Meeting, 10-13 October 2016) 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), 
Recalling that the FAO Council adopted on 23 June 2001 an International Plan of Action 
to prevent, to deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IPOA-IUU). 
This plan stipulates that the identification of the vessels carrying out illegal, unreported 
and unregulated (IUU) activities should follow agreed procedures and be applied in an 
equitable, transparent and non-discriminatory way; 
Recalling that the Extended Commission adopted the CCSBT Compliance Plan at its 
Eighteenth Annual Meeting in October 2011; 
Concerned by the fact that Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) IUU fishing activities diminish 
the effectiveness of CCSBT conservation and management measures,  
Determined to address the challenge of an increase in IUU fishing activities by way of 
counter-measures to be applied in respect to the vessels, without prejudice to further 
measures adopted in respect of flag States or entities under the relevant CCSBT 
instruments; 
Considering the action undertaken in all other tuna regional fisheries management 
organisations to address this issue; 
Conscious of the need to address, as a matter of priority, the issue of fishing vessels 
conducting IUU fishing activities,   
Noting that efforts to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing must be addressed in the 
light of all relevant international fisheries instruments and in accordance with other relevant 
international obligations, including the rights and obligations established under the World 
Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement; 
Recalling Article 15 (4) of the Convention, which calls on Members to cooperate in taking 
appropriate action, consistent with international law and their respective domestic laws, to 
deter fishing activities for SBT by nationals, residents or vessels of any State or entity not 
party to the CCSBT Convention where such activity could affect adversely the attainment 
of the objective of the Convention; 
Agrees, in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8 of the Convention for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, that: 
Definition of SBT IUU Fishing Activities and CCSBT IUU Vessel Lists 
1.
At each annual meeting, the Extended Commission will identify those vessels
which have engaged in fishing activities for SBT in a manner which has
undermined the effectiveness of the Convention and the CCSBT measures in
force. The Extended Commission shall establish, and amend as necessary in
subsequent years, a list of such vessels (the CCSBT IUU Vessel List), in
accordance with the procedures and criteria set out in this Resolution (or
subsequent revision).
2.
As part of the annual process, a Draft IUU Vessel List will first be drawn up by
the Executive Secretary based on information received from Members/
Cooperating non-Members (CNMs) and, with agreement from the Extended
Commission pursuant to Rule 6(5) of the Rules of Procedure, any other suitably
documented information at his/her disposal.  The Compliance Committee (CC)
will then adopt a Provisional IUU Vessel List based on the initial Draft IUU List
and any information provided in relation to the vessels on this Draft List. The CC
will also consider the current CCSBT IUU Vessel List and may make
recommendations to remove vessels from it as appropriate.  Finally, the Extended
Commission will consider both the Provisional IUU List and any
recommendations made by the CC to amend the current CCSBT IUU Vessel List,
and then adopt a final CCSBT IUU Vessel List.  CCSBT IUU Vessel List
definitions are provided at Annex I.
3.
For the purposes of this Resolution, the fishing vessels are presumed to have
carried out SBT IUU fishing activities, inter alia, when a Member or CNM
presents suitably documented evidence that such vessels:
a.
Harvested SBT and were not authorised by a Member or CNM to fish for
SBT, or;
b.
Did not record and/or report their SBT catches or catch-related data in
accordance with CCSBT reporting requirements, or made false reports, or;
c.
Used prohibited or non-compliant fishing gear in a way that undermines
CCSBT conservation and management measures, or;
d.
Transhipped with, or participated in joint operations such as re-supplying
or re-fuelling vessels included in the CCSBT IUU Vessel List, or;
e.
Harvested SBT in the waters under the national jurisdiction of the coastal
State or entity without authorisation and/or committed a serious
infringement of its laws and regulations directly related to the SBT
fishery, without prejudice to the sovereign rights of the coastal State or
entity to take measures against such vessels, or;
f.
Engaged in fishing activities for SBT, including transhipping, re-
supplying or re-fuelling, contrary to any other CCSBT conservation and
management measures.
Information on alleged SBT IUU Fishing Activities 
4.
Members and CNMs shall transmit every year to the Executive Secretary at least
14 weeks before the annual meeting of the CC, a list of vessels presumed to be
carrying out SBT IUU fishing activities during the current and/or previous year,
accompanied by the suitably documented supporting evidence concerning the
presumption of SBT IUU fishing activity.  The CCSBT Reporting Form for SBT
Illegal Activity (Annex II) shall be used.
5. This list and evidence shall be based, inter alia, on information collected by
Members and CNMs from all relevant sources including but not limited to:
a) Relevant resolutions of the CCSBT, as adopted and amended from time to
time;
b) Reports by Members and CNMs on vessel inspections;
c) Reports by Members and CNMs relating to CCSBT conservation and
management measures in force;
d) Catch and trade information obtained on the basis of relevant trade statistics
such as Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) data,
statistical and CDS documents, and other national or international verifiable
statistics; and
e) Any other information obtained from port States or entities and/or gathered
from the fishing grounds that is suitably documented.
6. Before or at the same time as transmitting a list of presumed SBT IUU vessels to
the Executive Secretary, the Member or CNM shall notify the relevant flag State
or entity, either directly or through the Executive Secretary (using the Reporting
Form in Annex II), of a vessel’s inclusion on this list, and provide that flag State
or entity with a copy of the pertinent suitably documented information. Where a
vessel will be included on the Draft IUU list and has not been proposed by a
Member or CNM, the Executive Secretary shall notify the relevant flag State or
entity (using the Reporting Form in Annex II), of the vessel’s inclusion on this
list, and provide that flag State or entity with a copy of the pertinent suitably
documented information as early as practicable.
Draft CCSBT IUU Vessel List 
7. On the basis of the information received pursuant to paragraph 4, and any other
suitably documented information available, the Executive Secretary shall draw up
a Draft IUU Vessel List. This list shall be drawn up in conformity with Annex
III. The Executive Secretary shall transmit it together with the current CCSBT
IUU Vessel List, including any inter-sessional amendments, as well as all the
supporting evidence provided, to all Members, and CNMs as well as to those
Non-Cooperating Non-Members (NCNMs) whose vessels are included on these
lists, at least 10 weeks before the annual CC meeting.
8. The Executive Secretary shall request the flag State or entity to notify the owner
of the vessel(s) of its/their inclusion in the Draft IUU Vessel List and of the
consequences that may result from its/their inclusion being confirmed in the 
CCSBT IUU Vessel List adopted by the Extended Commission. 
9. Upon receipt of the Draft IUU Vessel List, Members and CNMs shall closely
monitor the vessels included in the Draft IUU Vessel List in order to determine
their activities and possible changes of name, flag and/or registered owner.
10. Members, CNMs and NCNMs with vessels included on the Draft IUU and/or
current CCSBT IUU Lists will transmit any comments to the Executive Secretary
at least 6 weeks before the annual CC meeting, including suitably documented
information as described in paragraph 22, showing that the listed vessels have not
fished for SBT in a way that undermines CCSBT conservation and management
measures.
11. On the basis of the information received pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 10, the
Executive Secretary shall circulate the Draft IUU Vessel list and the current
CCSBT IUU Vessel List, together with all suitably documented information
provided pursuant to paragraph 10 as a CC meeting document to all Members and
CNMs 4 weeks in advance of the annual CC meeting.
12. All Members, CNMs, and any NCNMs concerned may at any time submit to the
Executive Secretary any additional information, which might be relevant for the
establishment of the CCSBT IUU Vessel list. The Executive Secretary shall
circulate the information, at the latest before the annual CC meeting, together with
all the evidence provided.
Provisional CCSBT IUU Vessel List 
13. Each year the CC shall examine the Draft IUU Vessel List and current CCSBT
IUU Vessel list, as well as the information referred to in paragraphs 7, 11 and 12.
14. The CC shall remove a vessel from the Draft IUU Vessel List if the flag State or
entity demonstrates that:
a) The vessel did not take part in any SBT IUU fishing activities described in
paragraph 3, or
b) Effective action has been taken in response to the SBT IUU fishing activities
in question, including, inter alia, prosecution and/or imposition of sanctions
of adequate severity. Members and CNMs will report any actions and
measures taken to promote compliance by their flagged vessels with CCSBT
conservation and management measures.
15. Following this examination, the CC shall:
a) Adopt a Provisional IUU Vessel List in conformity with Annex III following
consideration of the Draft IUU Vessel List and information and evidence
circulated under paragraphs 7, 11 and 12. The Provisional IUU Vessel List
shall be submitted to the Extended Commission for approval, and
b) Recommend to the Extended Commission which, if any, vessels should be
removed from the current CCSBT IUU Vessel List, following consideration
of the current List and of the information and evidence circulated under
paragraphs 10 and 12.
CCSBT IUU Vessel List 
16. At its annual meeting the Extended Commission shall review the Provisional IUU
Vessel List, taking into account any new suitably documented information related
to vessels on the Provisional IUU Vessel List, and any recommendations to
amend the current CCSBT IUU Vessel List made pursuant to paragraph 15 above.
The Extended Commission will then adopt a new CCSBT IUU Vessel List.
17. Upon adopting the new CCSBT IUU Vessel List, Members, CNMs and NCNMs
with vessels on the CCSBT IUU Vessel List are requested to:
a) Notify the owner of the vessel of its inclusion on the CCSBT IUU Vessel List
and the consequences that result from being included on the CCSBT IUU
Vessel List, as referred to in paragraph 18, and
b) Take all the necessary measures to eliminate these IUU fishing activities,
including, if necessary, the withdrawal of the registration or the fishing
licenses of these vessels, and to inform the Extended Commission of the
measures taken in this respect.
18. Members and CNMs shall take all necessary non-discriminatory measures subject
to, and in accordance with their applicable laws and regulations, international law
and each Member’s/ CNM’s international obligations to:
a)
Remove or withdraw any SBT fishing authorisations for the vessel or impose
alternative sanctions consistent with domestic laws and regulations of the flag
State;
b) Ensure that the fishing vessels, flying their flag do not assist in any way,
engage in fishing processing operations or participate in any transhipment or
joint fishing operations with vessels included on the CCSBT IUU Vessel List;
c)
Ensure that vessels on the CCSBT IUU Vessel List are not authorised to land,
tranship, re-fuel, re-supply, or engage in other commercial transactions in
their ports, except in case of force majeure;
d) Ensure that foreign flagged vessels included on the CCSBT IUU Vessel List
do not enter into their ports, except in case of force majeure, unless vessels
are allowed entry into port for the exclusive purpose of inspection and/or
effective enforcement action;
e)
Ensure that a vessel included in the CCSBT IUU Vessel List is not chartered
based on its license;
f)
Ensure that foreign-flagged vessels included in the CCSBT IUU Vessel List
are not granted their flag, except if the vessel has changed owner and the new
owner has provided sufficient evidence demonstrating the previous owner or
operator has no further legal, beneficial or financial interest in, or control of,
the vessel, or having taken into account all relevant facts, the flag Member or
CNM determines that granting the vessel its flag will not result in IUU
fishing; 
g) Ensure that SBT from vessels included in the CCSBT IUU Vessel List are not
landed, farmed, transhipped and/or traded internationally and and/or
domestically; and
h) Collect and exchange with other Members and CNMs any appropriate
information with the aim of searching for, controlling and preventing false
CDS documents and/or false import/export certificates of SBT from vessels
included in the CCSBT IUU Vessel List.
19. The Executive Secretary will take any necessary measure to ensure publicity of
the CCSBT IUU Vessel List adopted by CCSBT, in a manner consistent with any
applicable confidentiality requirements, and through electronic means, by placing
it on the CCSBT web site. Furthermore, the Executive Secretary will transmit the
CCSBT IUU Vessel List to appropriate regional fisheries organisations for the
purposes of enhanced co-operation between CCSBT and these organisations in
order to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing.
Cross-Listing 
20. The Extended Commission may consider cross-listing IUU vessel lists with all
other tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisations and relevant
organisations on a case by case basis as agreed by the Extended Commission.
Trade Measures/ Sanctions 
21. Without prejudice to the rights of flag States or entities and coastal States or
entities to take proper action consistent with international law, including
applicable WTO obligations, Members and CNMs shall not take any unilateral
trade measures or other sanctions against vessels provisionally included in the
Draft and Provisional IUU Vessel Lists, pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 15, or
which have been already removed from the CCSBT Draft, Provisional or Current
IUU Vessel Lists, pursuant to paragraphs 14 or 16 or 22 - 26, on the grounds that
such vessels are involved in SBT IUU fishing activities.
Deletion from the CCSBT IUU Vessel List 
22. A Member, CNM or NCNM whose vessel appears on the CCSBT IUU Vessel
List may request the removal of the vessel from the list through the Compliance
Committee or at any time during the inter-sessional period by submitting to the
Executive Secretary suitably documented information demonstrating that:
a) It has adopted measures so that this vessel complies with all CCSBT
conservation and management measures; and
b) It is and will continue to assume effectively its responsibilities with respect to
this vessel in particular as regards the monitoring and control of the SBT
fishing activities executed by this vessel; and
c) One or more of the following:
i) It has taken effective action in response to the SBT IUU fishing activities
that resulted in the vessel's inclusion in the CCSBT IUU Vessel List,
including prosecution or the imposition of sanctions of adequate severity; 
ii) The vessel has changed ownership and that the new owner can establish
that the previous owner no longer has any legal, financial or real interests in 
the vessel or exercises control over it, and that the new owner has not 
participated in SBT IUU fishing activities; 
iii) The case regarding the vessel that conducted SBT IUU fishing activities
has been settled to the satisfaction of the Member(s)/ CNM(s) that originally 
submitted the vessel for listing and the flag State or entity involved. 
23. On the basis of the information received in accordance with paragraph 22, the
CCSBT Executive Secretary will transmit electronically the removal request, with
all the supporting information to each Member within 15 days following the
notification of the removal request.
24. Each Member of the Extended Commission will examine the request to remove
the vessel and notify the Executive Secretary in writing of their conclusion
regarding either the removal from, or the maintenance of the vessel on the
CCSBT IUU Vessel List within 21 days following the notification by the
Executive Secretary referred to in paragraph 23.
Decisions on any inter-sessional requests to remove the vessel shall be made in
accordance with Rule 6(5) of the Rules of Procedure, such that no response is
considered to be support for the request.
25. The Executive Secretary shall communicate the result of the decision to all
Members and CNMs and to any NCNM which requested the removal of its vessel
from the CCSBT IUU Vessel List.
26. If Members agree to the removal of the vessel from the CCSBT IUU Vessel List,
the Executive Secretary will take the necessary measures to remove the vessel
concerned from the CCSBT IUU Vessels List, as published on the CCSBT web
site. Moreover, the Executive Secretary will forward the decision of removal of
the vessel to appropriate regional fisheries organisations.
27. If a Member does not agree with the request for the removal of the vessel from the
CCSBT IUU Vessel List, the vessel will be referred to the Compliance
Committee for further consideration and the Executive Secretary will inform the
Members, CNMs as well as any NCNMs that made the removal request.
ANNEX I: CCSBT IUU Vessel List Definitions 
The format of all CCSBT IUU Vessel Lists must conform to Annex III. 
Draft CCSBT IUU Vessel List 
This list is drawn up by the Executive Secretary in accordance with paragraph 7, and 
based on information submitted by Members and CNMs on the CCSBT Reporting Form 
for SBT Illegal Activity (Annex II), and any other suitably documented information 
about vessels presumed to be carrying out SBT IUU fishing activities during the current 
and/or previous year.  This list is then examined each year by the Compliance Committee 
(CC). 
Provisional CCSBT IUU Vessel List 
This list is derived from the Draft IUU Vessel List. 
It is created when the CC has completed its consideration of the Draft IUU Vessel List 
and the associated evidence circulated, and has made any appropriate amendments to the 
Draft List.  At this point, the appropriately amended Draft List is adopted by the CC as a 
Provisional IUU Vessel List.  
Current CCSBT IUU Vessel List 
This list is created from a combination of considering the agreed Provisional IUU Vessel 
List and the Current CCSBT IUU Vessel List. 
The Extended Commission reviews the Provisional IUU Vessel List at its annual meeting, 
taking into account any new suitably documented information related to vessels on the 
Provisional list, as well as any recommendations to amend the current CCSBT IUU 
Vessel List made by the CC.  This process will result in a CCSBT IUU Vessel List which 
is agreed and adopted by the Extended Commission as the current CCSBT IUU Vessel 
List. 
The current CCSBT IUU Vessel List can be modified inter-sessionally according to 
paragraph 20 by cross-listing additions and/or removals from other RFMOs, or through 
requests from Members/CNMs/NCNMs according to paragraphs 22 to 27.
