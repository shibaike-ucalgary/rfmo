Report of the Extended Commission of the 
Twenty-Eighth Annual Meeting of the Commission 
11 –13 October 2021 
Online 
 
Agenda Item 1. 
Opening of meeting 
1.1. Confirmation of Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended Commission of the 
Twenty-eighth Meeting of the Commission 
1. 
Mr Max Kitchell (Australia) was confirmed as the Chair of the Extended 
Commission of the Twenty-Eighth meeting of the Commission for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT 28), and Mr Arthur Hore (New 
Zealand) was confirmed as the Vice Chair. 
2. 
The Chair welcomed Members and observers and opened the meeting. The 
Chair advised that the meeting this year is being held as a video conference 
(VC) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and that discussion for some agenda 
items had commenced in advance of the meeting by correspondence.  
3. 
The list of participants is provided at Attachment 1.

Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
9. 
The Report from the Secretariat was provided to the meeting as paper CCSBT-
EC/2110/04 and was considered during the pre-meeting discussion process. The 
report contained four matters for consideration by the EC as follow: 
 
• Whether to renew the appointment of the Chair of the Compliance 
Committee (CC) for another term; 
• The process for recruitment of a new Executive Secretary; 
• Granting Long-term observer status for CC meetings to the Agreement on the 
Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) and BirdLife International; 
and 
• Granting Long-term observer status for CC, EC and Commission meetings to 
The Pew Charitable Trusts (Pew). 
10. 
The Chair advised that Heads of Delegations have agreed to renew the 
appointment of the CC Chair for another three-year term and congratulated Mr 
Frank Meere on his reappointment. 
11. 
The meeting agreed to a modified process for recruitment of a new Executive 
Secretary, which is shown at Attachment 6. 
12. 
The meeting agreed to grant Long-term observer status for CC meetings to 
ACAP, BirdLife International and Pew, and for EC and Commission meetings 
to Pew. 
13. 
It was noted that the duration of “Long-term” observer status has not been 
defined. Instead, the Rules of Procedure state that the approvals for long-term 
observer status “will remain in-force until cancelled by the Commission”. 
14. 
The meeting noted the activities of the Secretariat as reported. 
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
15. 
The Chair advised that the Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee 
(FAC) was announced intersessionally in Circular #2021/054. The Chair 
thanked Mr Vallières for agreeing to Chair the FAC again. It was also noted that 
the FAC has already commenced its work. 
16. 
The Executive Secretary provided a brief presentation of the draft revised 
budget for 2021 (CCSBT-EC/2110/05), the proposed budget for 2022 and the 
indicative budget for 2023 - 2024 (CCSBT-EC/2110/06).   
17. 
For the revised 2021 budget, the Executive Secretary noted that: 
• All Members paid their 2021 contributions to the CCSBT in full, with the 
only outstanding payment being $5,539 by South Africa for CDS tags that 
were delivered to it in March 2021. 
• The expenditure for 2021 is forecast to be approximately $625,000 less than 
approved for 2021. Cancellation of physical meetings and travel due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic is the primary reason for the reduced expenditure, 
however, $150,000 of the reduced expenditure is due to deferral of some 
2021 expenses to 2022. 
18. 
The Executive Secretary noted that the 2022 draft budget and 2023 - 2024 
indicative budget includes the funding required for the CCSBT’s usual business, 
including the Extended Scientific Committee’s (ESC) three-year workplan. The 
Executive Secretary advised that 2022 draft budget assumes that the 2022 
OMMP, ESC, CC and EC meetings will proceed as physical meetings, however 
 
there is no certainty that this will be possible and savings will be achieved if 
these meetings proceed as virtual meetings instead of as physical meetings.  
19. 
The draft budget for 2022 proposes that Member contributions for 2022 remain 
at the same level as for 2021 and 2020. However, the Executive Secretary also 
warned that current Member contribution levels are not sufficient to cover the 
current annual running costs of the CCSBT. The budget paper advised that a 
gradual increase in Membership contributions of 3.5% per year from 2023 to 
20261 together with usage of the remaining savings and the Contributions 
Stabilisation Fund would be sufficient to reach a contribution level that would 
cover the annual running costs of the CCSBT. 
20. 
Detailed consideration of the two budget papers was referred to the FAC. 
21. 
The FAC was convened to consider: 
• The revised budget for 2021; 
• The proposed budget for 2022; and  
• The indicative budget for 2023 - 2024. 
 
3.1. Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
22. 
The EC thanked the FAC Chair and the FAC for its hard work. 
23. 
The EC adopted the report of the FAC, noting the revised 2021 budget at Annex 
A, approving the budget for 2022 at Annex B and noting the indicative budgets 
for 2023-2024 at Annex C.  
24. 
The full report of the FAC is provided at Attachment 7. Highlights include that 
that the overall financial situation for EC is that contributions are not meeting 
expenses and that there will need to be increased contributions or reduced 
expenditure in future years. The budget for 2022 includes a 1% increase in 
Member contributions for 2022. 
25. 
There was substantial discussion regarding the e-tagging design study that was 
recommended by the ESC. This study has not been funded for 2022 and has 
instead been included in the indicative budget for 2023. 
26. 
In relation to the e-tagging design study, Australia noted that the proposal was 
supported by the ESC and would allow for an assessment of the costs of benefits 
of long-term tagging work to confirm stock distribution, compare stock 
distribution to fishing effort, ensure CPUE data is meaningful, and estimate 
unaccounted for mortality. Australia further noted that changes in stock 
distribution due to climate change and other climate factors such as El Niño, and 
comparing distribution to fishing effort, were critical to ensure accuracy of data 
used in the stock assessment.  
27. 
However, some Members had concerns about proceeding with the design study 
at this stage, given budget pressures and to allow strategic consideration of 
competing budget priorities. Accordingly, consideration of the e-tagging design 
 
 
1 With a possible smaller increase in 2027. 
 
study was deferred until next year’s ESC and EC for consideration under the 
SRP.   
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries and ERS Interactions 
28. 
The Chair noted the deliberations of the CC on Members’ National Reports and 
invited Members to ask any questions regarding Members’ National Reports 
additional to those already raised at the Sixteenth Meeting of the Compliance 
Committee (CC16).  
29. 
No additional questions were asked in relation to Members’ National Reports. 
 
4.1. Reports on Members’ projects 
30. 
Australia noted its paper CCSBT-EC/2110/23 on its progress towards 
implementation of stereo video (SV).  Australia committed to implementing SV 
when the government’s pre-conditions were met, i.e., when it could be 
demonstrated that SV is cost-effective and fully automated.  Australia also noted 
that its planned SV trial had been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and 
was now undertaking a formal tender process for the trial which is now planned 
to commence in 2022. 
31. 
Some Members expressed concerns with the delay in the commencement of the 
SV trial and noted that the results of the trial should be reviewed by the ESC.   
32. 
Japan noted that it looks forward to the progress of SV trial and requested 
Australia to surely implement the trial in 2022. It also noted that the trial result 
should receive scientific review by the ESC. 
33. 
New Zealand referred to its paper CCSBT-EC/2110/18 on reducing uncertainty 
in SBT farming statistics and asked Australia whether it would be able to make 
its Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) data available for review and analysis 
by ESC, given that the ESC had pointed out that such an analysis could be very 
helpful. 
34. 
Australia stated that its current 100-fish sampling regime is accurate and 
precise, and further that the independent expert at the 2019 ESC meeting had 
advised that CDS data could only be used to give indirect estimates of catch.  
35. 
New Zealand further noted that, in the current circumstances, an indirect 
estimate was better than nothing and that some Members did not consider 
Australia’s current 100-fish sampling regime to be adequate, which is the reason 
why the SV trial was continually being encouraged. 
36. 
The EC noted that: 
• Some Members had expressed concerns about the continued delay in SV 
implementation;  
• Australia advised it is making its best efforts to commence the SV trial under 
difficult pandemic circumstances and that, subject to the formal tender 
process, it will commence in 2022; and 
• Australia did not agree to make its CDS data available for review and 
analysis due to it being commercial in confidence data. 
 
37. 
Japan presented an overview of its paper CCSBT-TCWG/2110/062 which 
provides updates on the Japanese Market Proposal.  Japan also thanked 
Members for their intersessional work to agree to a Terms of Reference for the 
appointment of an external expert to conduct the market work, as well as for 
Members’ initial recommendations regarding suitable experts. 
38. 
Japan noted that with regard to the market work: 
• The Secretariat will continue to provide additional information on markets in 
its Compliance with Measures paper (Attachment C) in 2022; 
• Japan will re-visit its proposal to develop a Resolution to seek the 
cooperation of non-Members after the conclusion of the Performance review 
and in consideration of that review’s recommendations; 
• In 2022, the Secretariat will repeat its trial analysis for verification of 
reported catch by Members with CDS data and CDS tag survey data obtained 
from the Japanese market with some agreed improvements; and 
• A set of Recommendations on CDS tag attachment to try to improve the 
readability of tags in markets was agreed by CC16 (Attachment 4 of CC16 
report). 
39. 
In Japan’s view, the tag management survey at Toyosu would benefit all 
Members and the cost should therefore be borne by the CCSBT.  An 
intersessional group will be formed to discuss this matter further following 
CCSBT 28. 
40. 
The meeting endorsed the selection of Dr Shelley Clarke as the external expert 
who will develop the methodology for the market proposal on verification of all 
Members’ catch. 
41. 
Australia supported Dr. Clarke’s appointment and requested that Dr. Clarke’s 
report should include all available datasets analysed, and requested that if some 
data-sets are not included, then a reason for their non-inclusion be provided 
within the report. Australia particularly referred to the data available from the 
Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG) on the source country of SBT sold.  
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
42. 
The independent Chair of the Compliance Committee, Mr Frank Meere, 
presented the report of CC16, outlining key points. The report is provided at 
Attachment 8. 
43. 
The CC Chair thanked participants for their efforts in responding to questions in 
the pre-meeting discussion documents which improved the overall transparency 
of the meeting, and for participating in a productive video conference meeting. 
44. 
The CC Chair highlighted to the EC that South Africa did not attend CC16 but 
did respond to questions in the pre-meeting document.  The CC Chair noted he 
had written to the Deputy Director General, Fisheries Management in the South 
African Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment about South 
 
 
2 This paper had already been discussed in detail at both TCWG2 and CC16. 
 
Africa’s non-attendance during CC16 but did not receive a reply prior to the 
close of CC16. 
45. 
The CC Chair highlighted key compliance issues discussed by CC16 which 
were: 
• There are no new serious compliance issues which require action under the 
Corrective Actions Policy3. 
• South Africa was found to be non-compliant, e.g., with respect to various 
CDS matters and non-submission of key data and reports.  As a result, CC16 
recommended that South Africa develop a plan, with associated timeframes, 
to address the issues of non-compliance identified by the CC. 
• As requested by EC 27, CC16 undertook a review of Indonesia's pay back 
plan and management measures and recommended that the revised payback 
figure submitted by Indonesia of 456.584t, which is 91.3 t annually over the 
five years, be agreed.  CC16 was encouraged by the actions Indonesia 
reported it was taking and believed those actions to be consistent with the 
payback and management commitments Indonesia made at EC27.  The CC 
Chair noted that given Indonesia’s current catch at 30 September 2021, 
Indonesia only has 173.99 t of Total Available Catch (TAC) remaining to be 
taken between now and the end of December 2021. 
46. 
The CC Chair noted some additional compliance issues discussed by CC16 
which were: 
• CDS implementation issues, ranging from significant recurring issues for 
South Africa to some minor ongoing issues for Korea and Australia; 
• Very late submission of port inspection reports (South Africa); 
• Continuing lack of full implementation of seabird mitigation measures by 
some Members; 
• The high percentage of unobserved at sea transhipments that occurred during 
20204 and so far reported for 2021; and 
• The low level of scientific observer coverage during 20204. 
47. 
The CC Chair also noted that no notifications had been received by the 
Executive Secretary in 2021 with respect to Compliance Policy Guideline 5 - 
Guideline on principles for action and steps to be taken in relation to 
extraordinary circumstances.  However, Japan has advised that it will make a 
notification for August 2021 as soon as possible. 
48. 
The CC Chair referred to the CC16 meeting report including the report's 
workplan (paragraph 142) and summarised the recommendations (and notes) to 
the EC which are provided in paragraphs 144 and 145 of the report respectively, 
including the recommendation that a TCWG meeting be held prior to CC17. 
49. 
Australia proposed that work on depredation should be considered in 
conjunction with the ESC’s research planning process and be prioritised 
accordingly. Australia also supported the CC recommendation to discuss the 
 
 
3 Noting that Indonesia’s over-catches in 2019 and 2020 are already being addressed and paid back 
under the Corrective Actions Policy.

possible use of electronic monitoring, mindful of progress being made by other 
RFMOs, to assist in reducing the uncertainties around CPUE, discarding, 
predation and seabird mortality. 
50. 
New Zealand reiterated its concern at the high levels of seabird bycatch and 
noted the need to improve compliance with mitigation measures. 
51. 
The EC Chair advised that the EC endorsed all of CC16’s recommendations and 
notes with one exception and two minor updates: 
• Recommendation 15 which was deferred for consideration until Agenda Item 
7; 
• Recommendation 2 was modified to name the specific Members (Australia 
and New Zealand) that had offered to provide assistance to South Africa; and 
• Recommendation 7b was updated to include a note that the agreed revision to 
paragraph 1.2 of the CDS Resolution also needed to be reflected in 
appropriate revisions to the associated instructions in Appendix 1 of the CDS 
Resolution.6  
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
52. 
The independent Chair of the ESC, Dr Kevin Stokes, presented the report of the 
ESC for the Twenty Sixth meeting of the Scientific Committee (SC 26), which 
is summarised in papers CCSBT-EC/2110/09 (Rev.1) and CCSBT-EC/2110/16, 
and is provided in full at Attachment 9.  
53. 
It was recalled that, in 2020, EC 27 agreed that better communication between 
the ESC and EC was needed to help prevent misunderstanding in the future. The 
EC instructed the ESC to consider how this could be achieved. Members were 
requested to submit papers with ideas on how to improve the communication. 
The ESC Chair advised that “Chair’s report of the Twenty Sixth Meeting of the 
Extended Scientific Committee” (CCSBT-EC/2110/09 (Rev.1)) was produced 
for the EC based on a recommendation by the ESC on this matter. 
54. 
In response to questions from Members, the ESC Chair clarified that: 
• Total Reproductive Output (TRO) is similar to Spawning Stock Biomass 
(SSB) as an indicator of the stock. SSB is an estimate of the weight of fish 
able to spawn, whereas TRO is not a weight and takes into account that some 
aged fish are more productive. The move from SSB to TRO has not had 
much impact on the results of the stock assessment and may even be slightly 
more optimistic. 
• Work on the new CPUE index is progressing well and it is expected that a 
revised and accepted CPUE series will be available next year. 
 
 
5 CC16 Recommendation 1: “That the revised payback figure submitted by Indonesia of 456.584 t 
which is 91.3 t annually over the five years be agreed.  CC is encouraged by the actions that were 
reported back by Indonesia and believes that these are in keeping with the commitments made as part 
of the plans agreed at EC27, noting that with the current catch Indonesia only has 173.99 t available 
between now and the end of December”. 
6 The Secretariat will revise the instructions for CDS Resolution Appendix 1 in accordance with the 
agreed revision of paragraph 1.2.  
 
• Fishery dependent indexes, such as CPUE and the trolling survey index, are 
not as robust as fishery independent indexes, such as the Close Kin mark 
recapture and Gene Tagging indexes, which provide more reliable estimates.  
• The ESC’s new approach for prioritising research is intended to be forward 
looking and hopes to see proposals up to four years in advance. 
• An e-tagging project would provide a number of benefits to the EC, 
including reducing the uncertainty on the distributional range of the SBT, 
which has implications for CPUE interpretation and estimates of non-
Member catches. The e-tagging design study will refine questions in relation 
to the benefits of e-tagging and compare different studies in terms of what 
benefits they provide, how feasible they are and how much they are likely to 
cost. 
55. 
Members and the ESC Chair discussed the issue of communication between the 
ESC and EC. It was noted that: 
• Members have three main stakeholder groups (fishery managers, scientists, 
and industry) that need improved understanding of the science, as well as an 
improved means to communicate the science results with each other. 
• Workshops or seminars in-country would be beneficial to communication. 
Participation of the Scientific Advisory Panel and the ESC Chair in such 
workshops would be helpful, noting the budgetary implications. Some 
Members are already planning to hold internal workshops. 
• Graphs of the science results are desirable, particularly in relation to trends, 
but can be misleading if too complex and interpreted incorrectly. 
• Part of the difficulty managers have in understanding the results of stock 
assessments and the Management Procedure (MP) is due to the complex 
uncertainties and the number of different scenarios and projections presented. 
• Predicted TAC histogram (as shown in Attachment 9 of ESC 26 report) is 
useful to supplement conventional projection graphs which may give wrong 
impression that median trajectory is the most likely. Predictions for the 
future, such as TAC, are desirable, noting that predicting the future carries 
risks and the predications could even be incorrect. 
• The idea of the ESC producing a non-technical summary of its report was 
supported. 
• Some scientists of developing Members are unable to attend some scientific 
meetings, such as the OMMP and ERSWG, which hinders their 
understanding of the science. The possibility of the CCSBT providing 
funding for some Member’s scientists to attend meetings will be discussed in 
the FAC. 
56. 
It was noted that the estimate in 2020 that the stock has recovered to 20% of 
initial TRO is a doubling of the stock since 2009, which is a significant 
rebuilding of the stock during this period. 
57. 
Pew congratulated the EC for the success of its MP and for following its 
recommendations. The EC and ESC Chairs also stated that the science of the 
MP is world leading and is an excellent example of fisheries management to 
other RFMOs.    
 
58. 
It was agreed that Members would provide suggestions on how the ESC can 
improve communication with the EC intersessionally. The Secretariat will 
compile responses for the next ESC meeting. 
59. 
The EC adopted the report of the ESC, noting that the e-tagging component of 
the ESC’s work program would be further considered in the FAC and that the 
recommendations on the TAC and Research Mortality Allowance would be 
discussed further at Agenda Item 7. 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
7.1. Attributable SBT Catch 
60. 
The Chair noted that full implementation of the agreed CCSBT definition of 
Attributable SBT Catch commenced during the 2018 season and opened the 
floor for discussion on how each Member has accounted for its total SBT 
mortalities.  
61. 
Most Members reported their total Attributable Catch as well as a breakdown of 
their SBT mortalities across different sectors.  The EU emphasised that it 
forbids its vessels to target SBT and that it had 0 t of SBT catch in 2020.  Table 
1 summarises the Attributable Catches reported by each Member either during 
the meeting or in National Reports:

7.2. TAC Determination 
62. 
The Chair noted that the CCSBT adopted a new MP at CCSBT 26 to guide the 
setting of the global total allowable catch for 2021 and beyond. The MP 
 
 
7 2019/20 season. 
8 2020 calendar year. 
9 2020/21 season. 
 
recommended a SBT TAC of 17,647 tonnes per year for the 2021 to 2023 quota 
block10.  The Chair further advised that a review by the ESC did not identify 
any exceptional circumstances, and therefore the ESC recommended that the 
2022 SBT global TAC should remain at 17,647 t. 
63. 
Humane Society International (HSI) stated that there had been very little 
consideration of the seabird conservation crisis in reviewing the SBT TAC and 
queried whether the current levels of seabird mortality should be seen as an 
extenuating circumstance, although HSI recognised that the adopted MP does 
not factor in seabird mortalities. 
64. 
The ESC Chair confirmed that the MP considers only the SBT population and 
not the seabird population.     
65. 
The EC endorsed the global SBT TAC of 17,647 t for the upcoming 2022 
season. 
 
7.3. Research Mortality Allowance 
66. 
The Chair advised that CCSBT 27 agreed that an allocation of 6 t per year 
would continue to be made for Research Mortality Allowance (RMA) within the 
TAC for 2021 to 2023 and that the EC needs to decide whether to approve 
RMA requested for research projects in 2021/2022. 
67. 
The EC approved a total of 6 tonnes of RMA requested for the following 
research projects in 2021/2022, which were endorsed by the ESC: 
• 1.75 t for the CCSBT Gene Tagging Project;  
• 0.5 t by Japan for trolling surveys of age-0 SBT in North-west Australia and 
age-1 SBT in South-west Australia; 
• 3.0 t by Australia for a project to trial the use of stereo video technology to 
determine the weight of catch taken in Australia’s SBT farming sector; and 
• 0.75 t by Australia in the event that a small number of popup satellite tags are 
released in 2021-22 to examine localised Great Australian Bight (GAB) SBT 
movement and behaviour over the summer. 
 
7.4. Allocation of TAC 
68. 
The Chair advised that the allocations to Members for 2021 to 2023 were agreed 
at CCSBT 27, together with the effective catch limits for 2021. These 
allocations and catch limits are provided in Table 2 below. 
 
 
 
10 This is the same TAC as for the 2018 to 2020 quota block.

The Chair further advised that there are two items that require specific 
consideration under this agenda item: 
• The current effective catch limit for Indonesia of 1,122.8 t includes a special 
temporary allowance of 80 t15.  The EC needs to consider the information 
provided to CC16 on Indonesia’s compliance with its Payback Plan 
(including that no further over-catch has occurred), and progress with its 
management plan, and decide whether to endorse the continuation of this 
special temporary allowance (80 t) to Indonesia for the upcoming 2022 
season. 
• Indonesia’s proposed revised Payback Plan (item b. of paper CCSBT-
CC/2110/19) is shown in Table 3 below.  The EC needs to decide whether to 
endorse the modified Payback Plan, which reduced the annual payback from 
91.8 t to 91.3 t per year due to a lower than anticipated catch in 2020.

12 Includes a deduction of 7 t for Australia’s voluntary transfer to Indonesia. 
13 Includes voluntary transfers to Indonesia of 21 t from Japan, 7 t from Australia and the special temporary 
allowance of 80 t. 
14 Includes a voluntary transfer of 27 t to South Africa from Japan. 
15 This special temporary allowance of 80 t to Indonesia does not affect the nominal catch level or 
nominal catch percentage levels in the Annex of the Resolution on the Allocation of the Global Total 
Allowable Catch. 
 
70. 
The Chair noted that CC16 had reviewed Indonesia's implementation of its 
payback plan and its advice to EC was, "That the revised payback figure 
submitted by Indonesia of 456.584 t which is 91.3 t annually over the five years 
be agreed. CC is encouraged by the actions that were reported back by 
Indonesia and believes that these are in keeping with the commitments made as 
part of the plans agreed at EC27, noting that with the current catch Indonesia 
only has 173.99 t available between now and the end of December”. 
71. 
Members expressed their appreciation of the actions Indonesia is taking to 
remain within its plans and TAC.  Some Members expressed concern that there 
is a risk Indonesia might potentially over-catch SBT in 2021, especially since 
Indonesia often has increased catches during the fourth quarter of the year.  One 
Member queried what will happen to Indonesia’s Payback Plan and allocation if 
an over-catch does occur during 2021.  Some Members noted that it was their 
understanding that the 80 t special allowance is dependent on Indonesia 
remaining within its payback plan and TAC, but that it was too early discuss 
what might happen if there is an over-catch in 2021.        
72. 
Indonesia advised Members that it had already put in place several mechanisms 
to prevent future over-catches including an early warning system, as well as the 
potential to require that association members do not fish in particular areas 
within specified timeframes. 
73. 
Indonesia also stated that if the worst case occurred and there was another over-
catch, then it would absolutely follow the Corrective Actions Policy and modify 
its Payback Plan to take account any additional over-catch.  Indonesia reiterated 
that it did not want to lose its 80 t temporary allowance as it is very important to 
the livelihood of its industry, small scale and artisanal fisheries, therefore it was 
trying its best to follow its payback and management plans.  Indonesia also 
mentioned that it is trying to implement the workplan including in increasing its 
observer coverage although increased coverage is subject to budgetary 
constraints.  
74. 
The meeting recognised Indonesia’s endeavours to comply with its payback and 
management plans and noted some Members’ concerns that Indonesia could still 
potentially exceed its TAC limit during 2021. 
75. 
Given the information available to date and taking into account CC’s 
recommendation, the EC agreed: 
• That the special temporary allowance of 80 t for Indonesia should continue 
into 2022; 
• The allocations summarised in Table 2 above; and 
• Indonesia’s modified payback plan in Table 3 above. 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Ecologically Related Species (ERS) 
76. 
Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC.  
 
Update to CCSBT’s Resolution on Ecologically Related Species (ERS) 
77. 
The meeting agreed to adopt the changes to the CCSBT’s ERS Alignment 
Resolution16 that were proposed in paper CCSBT-EC/2110/11 from the 
Secretariat. The revised ERS Resolution adopted by the EC is shown at 
Attachment 10.   
Members’ performance with respect to ERS 
78. 
The Secretariat’s report on Members’ performance with respect to ERS was 
presented to the CC as paper CCSBT-CC/2110/05. The CC discussed this paper 
at its meeting in the previous week and the EC agreed that it did not need to 
discuss this paper further.   
Draft Agenda for the 14th Meeting of the Ecologically Related Species Working 
Group (ERSWG) 
79. 
The Chair advised that the next meeting of the ERSWG is planned to be held 
during March 2022 and it is likely to be held as a virtual meeting. 
80. 
The Secretariat provided a draft agenda for the next ERSWG meeting in paper 
CCSBT-EC/2110/12.  
81. 
There was no support to a suggestion from HSI that the ERSWG meeting 
consider possible changes to paragraph 7 of the ERS Alignment Resolution. 
Similarly, there was no support for including an agenda item for the ERSWG to 
formulate a submission requesting the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 
Commission (WCPFC) to provide advice on the relative efficacy of the 
mitigation measure options.  
82. 
There was support for ACAP, as the expert organisation in this field, to provide 
a presentation to the ERSWG on best practices for mitigation of seabird 
bycatch. 
83. 
ACAP advised that ACAP would be happy to present the upcoming ERSWG 
with an update on its best practice advice, noting that its recently concluded 
Working Group and Advisory Committee meetings adopted new guidelines and 
updated best practice mitigation measures that will be of interest to the 
ERSWG, together with an update on population trends for ACAP listed species 
in the CCSBT area. ACAP’s recent meetings also endorsed guidelines on 
electronic monitoring that would be relevant to planned discussions on EMS at 
the next TCWG meeting. 
84. 
Members discussed the need for annual ERSWG meetings. It was agreed that 
ERS bycatch, in particular seabirds, was an important issue that needed more 
focus, and annual meetings would help to provide that. Some Members noted 
that this would be an extra burden on relevant officials and scientists and they 
were not ready to agree to annual meetings. It was noted that virtual meetings 
could complement physical meetings to help reduce costs. 
85. 
Members agreed that the agenda for the next ERSWG meeting should include 
an item to discuss how to provide more focus on ERS species, especially 
seabirds, and the need for annual ERSWG meetings.  
 
 
16 Resolution to Align CCSBT’s Ecologically Related Species measures with those of other tuna RFMOs. 
 
86. 
The agreed draft agenda for the next ERSWG meeting is shown at Attachment 
11, noting that there will be a further opportunity for Members to add agenda 
items in the usual process for setting the Provisional Agenda. It was also agreed 
that a pre-meeting discussion process for “simple” agenda items will be 
established through Circulars in advance of the virtual meeting, together with a 
prioritisation of agenda items. 
Other ERS matters 
87. 
HSI commented that it considers that Member’s identified performance failings 
with respect to ERS warrants a TAC determination pause to allow the 
outstanding ERS related issues to receive attention. If not, and if a TAC increase 
is recommended for 2024-2026, HSI believes that even more seabirds will be 
killed by the corresponding fishing effort increase which will deepen the seabird 
conservation crisis. HSI further commented that the seabird crisis is largely 
driven by non-compliance with seabird mitigation measures, and that electronic 
monitoring could help improve the current inability to adequately verify 
compliance. 
88. 
Despite the opinion of HSI, Members agreed that ERS issues should be 
considered separately to the SBT stock, and that it was not appropriate to 
consider ERS matters as exceptional circumstances in relation to the MP and the 
TAC. 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Report of the Performance Review of the CCSBT 
89. 
The Chair advised that the CCSBT Performance Review process commenced in 
November 2020 and that it was originally intended that the final report would be 
available at EC 28.  However, the review panel had an extremely sad start - the 
original Chair of the Review Panel, Bill Gibbons-Fly, resigned and the 
replacement Chair, Professor Fábio Hazin, tragically passed away from 
COVID-19 in June 2021. Professor Hazin had already done a large amount of 
work before he passed and the meeting recognised this and expressed its sincere 
thanks. 
90. 
The Chair explained that the loss of two Performance Review Chairs and two 
panellists part way through the Panel’s work had been a major setback and that 
consequently the EC had agreed to make some changes to the performance 
review process as follows: 
• Mr. Hussain Sinan was appointed as the new Chair of the Performance 
Review Panel; 
• It was agreed that an interim Performance Review report be provided to the 
EC 28 in October 2021; and  
• The timeframe for completion of the final Performance Review report was 
extended until 1 March 2022. 
91. 
The meeting thanked Mr Sinan for agreeing to take on the role of the Chair of 
the Performance Review Panel at extremely short notice, and also thanked the 
other panel members, Mr Dominic Vallières from New Zealand, Professor Indra 
Jaya from Indonesia and Mr Hong-Yen Huang from Taiwan. 
 
92. 
The Chair of the CCSBT Performance Review, Mr Hussain Sinan, presented the 
interim report of the Panel (paper CCSBT-EC/2110/20). Mr Sinan highlighted 
the Panel’s key findings to date under the following four sub-headings: 
• Conservation and Management (Science) 
o CCSBT’s SBT scientific work and its incorporation in management is 
exceptional.  
o CCSBT needs a renewed focus (time and resources) for management of 
non-target species. 
o CCSBT has limited technical capacity for sophisticated computational 
models and emerging scientific processes. Capacity building is key to 
bridge the gap. 
o Limited observer coverage has been problematic in particular for non-
target species. 
o Accuracy, reliability and timeliness of data is vital for stock-assessments. 
CCSBT should fast-track the e-reporting systems. 
• Conservation and Management (Management) 
o SBT Management has improved significantly as evident from the 
improvement in stock status. 
o Measures to mitigate ERS species are not being implemented or fully 
implemented.  
o Concerns of poor communication between scientists and managers. This 
might pose a risk for the management in the future. 
o Needs to be a mechanism to revisit the allocation process that reflects 
international agreements. 
• Compliance and Enforcement 
o CCSBT’s MCS measures are in place, well-documented and easily 
accessible. 
o Lack of observer coverage and representativeness is an issue that needs to 
be dealt with. 
o Further improvements in CDS – timely reporting & improvement in 
quality. The eCDS will tackle some of these issues. 
o Catch tagging forms, farm stocking forms and farm transfer forms are 
collected as part of the CDS. However, they’re not used by the Secretariat, 
the CC, nor the ESC.  
o Absence of a follow-up process in compliance matters, in particular 
Quality Assurance Reviews (QARs). 
• Financial and Administrative Matters 
o Lack of communication between subsidiary bodies and the Finance and 
Administration Committee; 
o The importance of establishing a reserve/savings fund; and 
o The CCSBT Secretariat’s work is commendable. 
93. 
One Member made specific comments regarding paragraphs 52, 68, 86, 90, 110, 
116 and 134 of the Panel’s interim report highlighting that more detail could be 
appropriate to be presented in the final report, notably to avoid confusion and 
not to lead to possible conflict among Members.  Another Member requested 
 
that in the final report, the Panel provide more specific details for the rationale 
for the likely recommendation articulated in paragraph 52 of the interim report 
to allow Members to better understand and discuss this point next year (2022). 
94. 
Japan commented that, in relation to non-target species, the CCSBT Convention 
pre-dated some of the more recent RFMO Conventions and that therefore it may 
not specifically mention non-target species.  In addition, it mentioned that given 
the CCSBT does not have a spatially defined Convention Area, it is important 
that the CCSBT aligns its measures with those of other RFMOs, in particular for 
non-target species. 
95. 
One Member had no specific comment on draft recommendations but noted that 
the themes of the report, such as the need for a more strategic approach, were 
consistent with issues discussed by the CCSBT in recent years. 
96. 
In response to questions, Mr Sinan advised that: 
• The general format and tone of the interim report had been guided by the 
Performance Review terms of reference; and  
• That the Panel had identified some duplicative areas in existing CCSBT 
reporting templates. 
97. 
The meeting again thanked the CCSBT Performance Review Panel for its hard 
work. 
98. 
The Executive Secretary noted that no formal feedback process had been 
envisaged regarding the interim performance review report but urged any 
Members who had views they had not yet expressed to provide these to the 
Panel as soon as possible. 
99. 
The meeting agreed that all 2022 meetings of CCSBT subsidiary bodies 
(ERSWG, ESC and the CC) should consider any pertinent recommendations 
made by the performance review panel in its final report17, and provide advice 
to CCSBT 29 on any final recommendations relating to them. 
100. The Chair noted that the terms of reference for the performance review stated 
that, “the EC will decide whether there are any urgent recommendations that 
need early implementation”, and that Members should consider this possibility 
even though only the interim report is currently available.  Members did not 
identify any interim recommendations to consider implementing immediately. 
Agenda Item 10. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
101. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC.  
102. The Secretariat submitted paper CCSBT-EC/2110/13 which summarised the 
Secretariat’s interactions with non-Members since CCSBT 27. China, Fiji, 
Mauritius, Namibia, Singapore and the USA were invited to attend this meeting 
and CC16.  
 
 
17 These will be available by 1 March 2022. 
 
103. The EC agreed to invite China, Fiji, Mauritius, Singapore and the USA to 
participate as observers at CC 17 and CCSBT 29. 
104. Members noted that there have been difficulties obtaining responses from non-
Members in the past despite endeavours from the Secretariat and Members. It 
was considered important to engage with those that are potentially catching SBT 
or are an important port or market State. Members generally agreed that a 
different and stronger strategy might be required. One Member commented that 
the CCSBT is a multilateral international platform and all communications from 
the CCSBT, such as invitations, should be in a standard format.  
105. China’s domestic regulation to avoid catching and forbidding retention of SBT 
was noted, but it wasn’t known if this regulation has been effectively 
implemented. 
106. Members were encouraged to engage with non-Members at a diplomatic level 
and in other RFMOs, as this approach has provided some results in the past. 
107. It was agreed that New Zealand will consider a strategy with alternative 
approaches to non-Members and present it to the next EC meeting. 
108. The Meeting thanked the United States for its continued cooperation with the 
CCSBT’s Catch Documentation Scheme. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
11.1. Reports from other RFMO meetings of interest  
109. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC.  
110. The Chair advised that CCSBT Members act as CCSBT observers at RFMO 
meetings of interest, and these Members provide reports back to the CCSBT on 
matters of relevance in order to improve coordination with other RFMOs. 
111. The following reports were provided by Members as part of their Observer 
duties for the CCSBT. 
• Korea’s report (CCSBT-EC/2110/19) on the 17th Regular Session of the 
WCPFC;  
• New Zealand’s report (CCSBT-EC/2110/24) on the 39th Annual Meeting of 
the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
(CCAMLR);  
• Indonesia’s report (CCSBT-EC/2110/25 in relation to the Twenty Fifth 
session of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC); 
• Japan’s report (CCSBT-EC/2110/22) on the 2020 Discussions on Essential 
Commission Business in lieu of the 22nd Special Meeting of The 
International Commission for The Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT); 
and 
• Taiwan’s report (CCSBT-EC/2110/17) in relation to the 98th Annual Meeting 
of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). 
 
112. It was agreed that the following Members would act as Observers to other 
RFMOs on behalf of CCSBT during 2021/22: 
• Korea to continue as Observer to WCPFC; 
• New Zealand to continue as an Observer to CCAMLR;  
• Indonesia to continue as an Observer to IOTC; 
• Japan to continue as an Observer to ICCAT; and 
• Taiwan to continue as an Observer to IATTC. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Confidentiality of Data and Documents 
12.1.   Confidentiality of reports and documents from 2021 
113. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC.  
114. The meeting agreed that all the reports of meetings and documents submitted to 
meetings under the jurisdiction of CCSBT 28 would be made publicly available 
with the following exception that was listed in the Secretariat’s paper CCSBT-
EC/2110/15: 
• Attachment A of paper CCSBT-ESC/2108/04 from the Secretariat titled 
“Secretariat Review of Catches”. 
115. The EU advised that paper CCSBT-CC/2110/09 on a “Desktop (Phase 1) 
Quality Assurance Review of the European Union (EU)” should be restricted 
until the end of CCSBT 28” and that it may be publicly released with other 
documents immediately on conclusion of the meeting.  
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Meetings for 2022 
116. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC.  
117. New Zealand, the meeting host for 2022, advised that it hoped to hold face-to-
face ESC, TCWG, CC and EC meetings, but that it could not yet predict 
whether this will be possible. 
118. Indonesia advised that, due to budgetary constraints, it probably will not be able 
to attend any face-to-face RFMO meetings in 2022. 
119. The meeting noted that it should be technically possible to hold hybrid meetings 
with some participants being physically present and others participating 
virtually. However, it was also commented that this style of meeting would 
disadvantage the delegation(s) attending virtually. 
120. It was agreed that the 14th meeting of the ERSWG would be held online, from 
21 to 25 March 2022. 
121. The EC agreed that the dates for physical ESC, TCWG, CC and EC meetings in 
New Zealand during 2022 will be: 
• The 27th ESC meeting, from 29 August to 3 September 2022;  
 
• The 3rd TCWG Meeting, 5 October 2022; 
• The 17th CC Meeting, from 6 to 8 October 2022; and   
• The 29th EC Meeting, from 10 to 13 October 2022. 
122. It was further agreed that if the ESC, TCWG, CC and/or EC meetings become 
virtual meetings, the new dates would become: 
• ESC: 29 August to 6 September (with a rest day on the Sunday); 
• TCWG: 3 October; 
• CC: 4-7 October; and 
• EC: 10-14 October. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Election of the Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended 
Commission of the 29th Annual Meeting of the CCSBT 
123. The Chair advised that there were no nominations for the Chair and Vice-Chair 
of the EC, and that consequently, the Chair and Vice-Chair will be determined 
in accordance with past practice and the rotation of meetings. Therefore, New 
Zealand will be Chair of the EC and Korea will be Vice-Chair. 
124. The Chair requested that New Zealand and Korea provide their nominations for 
the Chair and Vice-Chair to the Secretariat as soon as possible. 
125. New Zealand advised that it is not yet able to nominate the Chair, and that in the 
meantime it will nominate an Acting Chair to deal with any essential matters 
such as the recruitment process for the new Executive Secretary. 
126. Korea advised that it will nominate a Vice Chair as soon as possible.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
On behalf of the Australian delegation, I would like to welcome you to CCSBT28, for 
which Australia is the host this year. Once again, we find ourselves meeting virtually, 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
We recognise the limitations of meetings of this type which provide only limited 
opportunities to meet informally to find solutions to issues. However, I understand 
Compliance Committee was able to complete its work last week with a great deal of 
flexibility and goodwill. Australia thanks all Members for their constructive approach 
to this important work which I’m sure will continue this week. We are hopeful that 
face to face meetings can resume next year. 
We want to acknowledge the Secretariat for the great work they do throughout the 
year, and in the lead up to these meetings. In particular, the contingency planning and 
video conference organisation has been excellent, and the pre-meeting discussion 
process, which we see as particularly useful and efficient and something we could 
adopt for future meetings even after the current restrictions end.  
Australia would also like to thank our translators who have the difficult task of 
keeping up with complex discussions, and on whom we rely on so heavily. The added 
complexity of virtual meetings must make their work even more challenging. 
Australia has made some good progress since our meeting last year. We continue to 
progress a trial of stereo video systems available worldwide and look forward to 
reporting on the outcome of that work upon completion. We are also putting in place 
measures to improve the return of our CDS import forms.  
Australia will continue to advocate strongly for the broad adoption of electronic 
monitoring systems throughout SBT fisheries noting likely improvements in reporting 
of catch, discards and ecologically related species interactions. EM may also help us 
better understand and tackle the seabird bycatch problem in part of the fishery, which 
has to be one of the highest priorities for the Commission now. 
Australia takes to opportunity to express our support for CCSBT Members who 
continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and note the very real impacts it 
is causing across industry, government, and the wider community. We note in 
particular South Africa’s circumstances and wish them well moving forward. 
Australia remains committed to working constructively with all members this week to 
achieve the best outcomes for CCSBT.  
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the European Union 
 
Mr. Chairman, 
Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
The EU Delegation is once again very happy to participate in the Annual Meeting of 
the CCSBT Extended Commission. We would like to thank the Secretariat for the 
hard and competent work dedicated to the preparation of this virtual meeting as well 
as for the progress achieved in the pre-meeting exchanges and the support provided to 
delegations. 
We all continue suffering from the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic but we 
trust, that again, with the constant support of the Secretariat and the efforts made by 
Members and stakeholders, fishing activities will remain on track and the SBT stock 
keeps rebuilding. In this this difficult framework, we should continue our efforts to 
improve the level of compliance, which is essential to ensure the sustainability of all 
CCSBT fishing activities. 
The European Union welcomes the work and recommendations of the Scientific 
Committee, which set the direction to be followed in terms of Conservation Measures. 
As in previous years with regard to Ecological Related Species (ERS), the EU fully 
supports the implementation and updating of ERS mitigation and management 
measures.  
Looking at the remaining uncertainties in accounting mortalities in SBT farms as well 
as the management of information related to SBT markets, we are very keen to follow 
the progress accomplished since the last plenary. The EU encourages a prompt catch 
up of the delays in implementing the stereo-video technology that is the best available 
methodology for estimating the weight of SBT in farms. Moreover, the EU, 
recognising the efforts made during the intersessional period, would like to push for 
more accuracy on the information concerning SBT markets.  
The EU is pleased with the conclusions of its desktop Quality Assurance Review 
(QAR) as discussed in the Compliance Committee. This QAR provides some 
guidance in respect to possible adjustments in the European Monitoring, Surveillance 
and Control mechanisms and necessary tunings in relevant CCSBT Resolutions. 
With regard to the conclusions of the Compliance Committee and particularly the 
introduction of electronic monitoring mechanisms, the EU globally supports 
innovation but remains seeking convergence and complementarity with the situation 
of other tuna RFMOs.   
To conclude, I would like to underline our willingness to work constructively and co-
operatively with all Members to make this CCSBT session a success. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Honorable Chairperson, Distinguished Delegates, Observers, Ladies, and Gentlemen, 
Taiwan is delighted to participate in the 28th meeting of the CCSBT. On behalf of My 
delegation, I would like to extend our appreciation to Mr. Kennedy, the Executive 
Secretary, and the Secretariat staff for your excellent work in arranging all the virtual 
meetings and preparing the comprehensive meeting documents. Besides, taking this 
opportunity, I would like to express our gratitude to the Performance Review Panel 
Chair and all the panelists for conducting the review under the extraordinary 
circumstances, and express our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the 
late Panel Chair, Dr. Fábio Hazin. 
This year has been extraordinarily challenging for both the government and the 
industry. The fisheries operation has been greatly affected by the second wave of the 
COVID-19 in Taiwan, which leads to some of the management measures are forced to 
be conducted through alternative means. For example, the deployment of the IOTC 
ROP observers and the members’ scientific observer program has been significantly 
reduced or ceased. Even in such a situation, Taiwan, as a cooperating member of the 
CCSBT, commits and makes its effort to comply with all Resolution of the CCSBT 
and the Conservation and Management Measure of relevant RFMOs for the 
Ecologically Related Species, and we also have taken the appropriate measures to 
mitigate the impact of the extraordinary circumstances to the greatest extent possible. 
Regarding the allocation of the total allowable catch (TAC) of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
one of the critical issues for the 26th Extended Scientific Committee recommends was 
that the TAC in 2022 remains at 17,647 tones, which indicates that the stock is 
expected to maintain on the path of rebuilding under current management procedure. 
Taiwan is glad to see the positive outcome of the SBT stock, and we also believe that 
a solid monitoring scheme and implementation of corrective action, if needed, to its 
full extent is critical for long-term conservation and sustainable utilisation of the 
resources. 
Finally, I look forward to working with all members in the following days to achieve 
constructive outcomes for the sustainability of the SBT fishery. 
We wish for a successful meeting, thank you.

Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Honourable Chair  
Executive Secretary of the Commission, Distinguished Delegates, Observers, Ladies 
and Gentlemen,  
To begin with, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, I would like 
to thank the Secretariat for the effective and efficient ways to facilitate the virtual 28th 
Annual Meeting amidst the obstacles of the lingering Covid-19 pandemic since last 
year. I am also taking this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to the Chair 
of the Extended Commission, Mr. Max Kitchell, Executive Secretary, Mr. Robert 
Kennedy, and all Chairs of the Committees and Working Groups as well as 
Secretariat Staffs for their work throughout the year, and for always doing excellent 
jobs in arranging all preparatory works to this meeting.  
Further, I would like to retake this opportunity to express our solidarity with Member 
States who are fighting against Covid-19 and our sincere condolences for their loss. 
Hopefully, we could strive together to fight the disease in the spirit of good 
cooperation. In the middle of this unfortunate event, we shall endure and adapt. This 
meeting is thus held virtually with the protocols managed by the Secretariat and 
Chair. We hope that we could keep our spirit to have fruitful discussions in this 
meeting. 
Honourable Chair and distinguished delegates, 
In principle, Indonesia strongly keeps the commitments made as part of the plans 
agreed in EC27 meeting to ensure Indonesia’s catch remaining within TAC for 2021. 
To date, Indonesia has implemented most of the work plan that was submitted the last 
year, and will continue to implement the work plan as we know that we have a 
payback plan for our over-catch in 2022.  
We are willing to improve our management tools and welcome any assistance from 
other members and the Secretariat to ensure that Indonesia's management measures 
for SBT are in place to have better control of quota utilisation. As a member, 
Indonesia kindly asks the CCSBT and members to work together with Indonesia to 
seek a solution within the preferred policy framework.  
Regarding electronic catch documentation scheme, Indonesia will continue to 
participate in the trial of e-CDS. Indonesia has experiences in implementing our own 
e-CDS since 2015. It has gone through several improvements to adapt to the needs 
and practicality, with the aim at better data monitoring on SBT catch. 
Honourable Chair and distinguished delegates,  
As we acknowledge, SBT migrates within the Indonesian fisheries management areas 
and goes even further within the first 12 nautical miles from the Indonesia coastlines, 
where the SBT spawning areas are located. The natural behaviour of such SBT makes 
it almost impossible for artisanal and small-scale tuna fishers who fish in their 
"backyard" waters to stop fishing tuna and tuna-like species.  
This condition should be considered to be unique and special features of Indonesia 
which distinguishes Indonesia from other Parties to CCSBT and which also has a long 
history of SBT resource user. Therefore, we hope that the next discussion on the new 
TAC will include a pathway towards fairness and impartial consideration for 
developing coastal state rights and interest. 
Honourable Chair and distinguished delegates,  
To conclude my remarks, I hope that all of the critical agendas to be deliberated this 
week in this Commission meeting will provide beneficial results that can contribute 
significantly to our joint efforts to meet the utmost CCSBT objectives. With that, I 
would like to underline our willingness to work constructively and cooperatively with 
other delegations for the success of this meeting.  
Thank you. May all of us stay safe and healthy during this pandemic.

Opening Statement by Japan 
 
On behalf of the Japanese Delegation, I would like to make an opening statement. 
First of all, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Executive Secretary, 
Mr. Kennedy and staffs of the CCSBT Secretariat for their tireless efforts for 
organising this meeting even under such an arduous situation as caused by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to the interpreters for their excellent job. It is a very 
sad news that Mr. Kennedy will retire from the Executive Secretary’s position next 
year. I would like to express our sincere appreciation to his wide, long and excellent 
contributions to the CCSBT so far. We should do our best to find out equally capable 
candidates for his successor. 
While it is my first time to participate in CCSBT meeting, I have heard a lot of 
CCSBT’s good international reputation for its well-established harvest strategy based 
on the Management Procedure (MP). Meanwhile, even with the MP, it is important to 
minimise uncertainties relating to catch of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT), whether it is 
attributable to Members or non-Members. To further strengthen the robustness of the 
MP, we once again request Australia to surely take positive actions toward 
implementation on stereo-video cameras, including on-site trial. The progress should 
receive scientific review by the Scientific Committee in terms of reduction of 
uncertainty.  
Also, following the last year’s discussion, Japan has presented a comprehensive 
update for the Commission-wide catch verification scheme utilising market 
information. As the relative importance of the Japanese market has been decreasing, 
more attention and focus should be given to other SBT markets, including those in 
non-Members.  
Finally, I would like to conclude my remarks by expressing my hope that we will be 
able to make an important step forward for the future development of the CCSBT and 
further re-building of SBT stock, through a constructive discussion among all 
participants during this five-day meeting. 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Tena koutou, tënä koutou, tënä koutou katoa. Nga mihi nui ki a koutou 
Greetings to CCSBT members and observers.  
We meet again in a virtual environment and I would like to acknowledge the 
challenges we all face in dealing with the global pandemic that has beset us. In this 
regard, New Zealand extends its appreciation to the Secretariat for working 
assiduously to maintain the work of the Commission during these difficult times. Our 
appreciation is also extended to the Chairs and members of the subsidiary committees 
of the Commission and the intersessional working groups that continued their 
business during the year. Particular thanks go to the members of the performance 
review panel who had their own special and tragic challenges to deal with. 
As usual we have several important issues to consider at this meeting and we look 
forward to working with Members towards a constructive outcome. Our thoughts also 
extend to next year’s meeting, which New Zealand will host. It is perhaps too early to 
predict whether we will meet in person but it will be at this meeting that we decide the 
global catch limit for the next three year quota block. We believe that next year’s 
decisions should be informed by the best information that we have available and we 
encourage best endeavours to reduce the uncertainties that have plagued past 
Commission meetings. We acknowledge the efforts of Japan in this regard. 
We look forward to hearing the views of Members on the issues before us this week. 
Kia kaha colleagues

Opening Statement by the Republic of Korea 
 
Greetings from Sejong, Korea. 
We would like to start our opening statement by thanking the Executive Secretary and 
Secretariat staff for organising this virtual meeting in such a smooth and stable 
manner despite all the constraints stemming from the pandemic. It’s a pity that we 
have not been able to have in-person meetings for two years in a row now and we 
sincerely hope that 2022 will bring us good news regarding COVID-19 situation.  
We believe that the most important achievements that CCSBT accomplished in 
recently years, among others, are the establishment and continuous improvement of 
MP as well as the ongoing recovery of the SBT resources. Although there still is some 
room for further refinement of the MP and the stock remains below the level 
estimated to produce MSY, the rebuilding pace of 5% per year over the last 10 years 
is something we can be proud of and we appreciate the strong commitments and 
contributions of CCSBT Members. We have no doubt that all Members will continue 
to do their best for the conservation and optimum utilisation of SBT stock based on 
the existing CCSBT Resolutions and other rules in place. Most of all, we are mindful 
of the importance of scientific data submission and compliance with the TAC or 
national allocation. Although the COVID-19 still has a lingering negative impact on 
Members ability to fulfill their obligations under CCSBT Resolutions, we believe that 
the current difficult situation will come to an end soon.  
At the same time, in order for us to be able to continue this successful management of 
SBT stock, we believe that the dialogue or communication among scientists, fisheries 
managers, fishers and NGOs are crucial. Especially, those elements related to 
scientific work of the Commission such as stock assessment and running of MP are 
very difficult for non-scientists to understand, and we would like to explore a possible 
way to enhance the dialogue or communication between scientists and other 
stakeholders who are not scientists. We believe some of the other RFMOs have 
examples of addressing this matter.  
Having said that, we very much look forward to working with the Chairman, all 
Members, NGOs and the Secretariat during the 28th Annual meeting of the 
Commission, and hope the meeting will be a productive and successful one. 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by  
the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) 
 
ACAP is pleased to be able to participate in the virtual meetings of the Compliance 
Committee and Extended Commission. We congratulate the Chairs and the CCSBT 
Secretariat on the smooth arrangements for these meetings in difficult times.  
We value our cooperative relationship with the CCSBT enshrined in our 
Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2015. This MOU is soon to expire and we 
look forward to renewing it so as to continue to facilitate collaboration between 
CCSBT and ACAP to support efforts to minimise bycatch of albatrosses and petrels. 
Through its 13 Parties, the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels 
(ACAP https://acap.aq) strives to conserve albatrosses and petrels by coordinating 
international activities to mitigate threats to their populations. Bycatch in pelagic 
longline fisheries is one of the greatest threats to seabirds, particularly albatrosses and 
petrels. ACAP continues to work with others to address the challenges of the 
conservation crisis faced by albatrosses and petrels. This crisis requires ongoing, 
concerted efforts by all whose activities have an impact on the fate of these birds. The 
theme of World Albatross Day 2021, celebrated on 19 June, was “Ensuring Albatross 
Friendly Fisheries”. We see this as a joint endeavour for ACAP, RFMOs and others. 
Fortunately, the crisis is not insoluble. Within jurisdictions where implementation of 
effective mitigation measures and appropriate enforcement has occurred, reductions in 
seabird bycatch have been demonstrated, sometimes dramatically so and without 
perceived detrimental consequences arising.  
ACAP is pleased to see progress with the development of the CCSBT/BirdLife 
International initiative on enhancing education on, and implementation of, 
Ecologically Related Species seabird measures within CCSBT fisheries, a project 
which we fully support.    
ACAP continues to investigate best practice mitigation measures and to provide 
updated advice and guidance. The most recent meetings of ACAP’s Seabird Bycatch 
Working Group (SBWG10) and Advisory Committee (AC12), held in August-
September this year, reviewed ACAP’s best practice advice. Two additional 
mitigation measures for pelagic longline fisheries were assessed against the six best 
practice seabird bycatch mitigation criteria adopted by ACAP. These were underwater 
bait setting devices, specifically the Underwater Bait Setter’ (Skadia Technologies) 
and the Hookpod-mini. Following this review, ACAP recommends that the most 
effective way to reduce seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries is the 
simultaneous use of weighted branch lines, bird scaring lines and night setting, or use 
of one of the assessed hook-shielding and underwater bait setting devices. 
AC12 also adopted new guidelines for observers and for electronic monitoring, which 
we consider will be of interest to the CCSBT. Documents and reports submitted to the 
CCSBT Compliance Committee and Extended Commission illustrate that, while there 
have been some improvements, bycatch of seabirds remains a critical issue in CCSBT 
fisheries. We also note the difficulties some members have experienced in providing 
the required level of observer coverage.  
We look forward to presenting our new advice and guidelines to the ERSWG meeting 
next March and discussing them in more detail on that occasion. 
Attachment 5 – 2 
 
Opening Statement by BirdLife International 
 
BirdLife International thanks the Extended Commission (EC) for the opportunity to 
participate as an observer to this meeting. BirdLife International also thanks the 
CCSBT Secretariat and Members for continuing progress to improve fisheries 
management. We recognise the difficulties that the COVID-19 pandemic presents and 
sincerely appreciate the efforts that have been made to continue work and hold 
meetings at this time. 
Firstly, BirdLife wishes to acknowledge some of the improvements in regards to 
seabirds over the last year, in particular the reduction in seabird bycatch rates of 
Members and the continued  collaboration between Members, the Secretariat and 
BirdLife on the joint project on seabirds that is due to commence in mid-2022.  
Despite this progress the reduction in observer coverage in 2020 has hampered the 
ability of the CCSBT and Members to monitor the impacts of the SBT fishery, 
including on ERS interactions and compliance with mitigation measures. Indeed, 
some fleets were not meeting the minimum observer coverage requirements pre-
COVID19 and observer rates have decreased in 2020 with some Members having no 
observer coverage at all. BirdLife acknowledges that COVID-19 continues to 
represent an unprecedented situation, however we emphasise the need for CCSBT 
members to adapt to the COVID19 reality and the need to meet their obligations to 
implement CMMs and fulfil observer data requirements.  
BirdLife again notes the opportunity afforded by Electronic Monitoring systems on 
vessels to provide higher and more representative coverage of the CCSBT fleets than 
current observer programmes.  
The preliminary CCSBT Interim Performance Report highlights concerns over the 
CCSBTs inability to date to address the impact of SBT fisheries on nontarget species 
that belong to the same ecosystem, in particular seabirds. BirdLife shares this concern 
and welcomes the recommendation to look for ways to address any clarity issues 
surrounding CCSBT's mandate around the management of ERS. As well as the 
suggestions to increase resources for ERSWG and the EC to develop strengthened 
CMMs on ERS, particularly in reducing seabird mortality. We urge the CCBST and 
Members to take heed of the recommendations of the report and to implement the 
recommendations as soon as possible to ensure that the CCSBT lessens its impact on 
ERS.  
We remind the EC again that despite seabird Conservation Management Measures 
(CMMs) being in place in the tuna RFMOs for a decade, seabird bycatch in CCSBT 
remains concerningly high and implementation of the seabird CMM still requires 
improvement. BirdLife would like to remind Members that 15 of the 22 albatross 
species remain threatened with extinction – and that longline fisheries in high risk 
areas, authorised by tuna RFMOs, continue to be the principal cause of this 
conservation crisis. Of all five tuna commissions CCSBT has the highest degree of 
overlap between its fisheries and albatrosses, such that it is impossible for CCSBT 
member states to escape responsibility for seabird deaths caused by the tuna 
longliners they authorise.   
It’s now more than twenty years since CCAMLR members took effective steps to fix 
this same albatross bycatch problem in sub-Antarctic toothfish fisheries, and it is time 
that the tuna RFMOs, including CCSBT take further actions to solve this entirely 
avoidable issue. 
Attachment 5 – 3 
 
Opening Statement by Humane Society International 
 
Humane Society International (HSI) wishes to thank the Extended Commission for 
the opportunity to participate once again as an observer to this important decision-
making meeting. Despite the circumstances leading us to again meet virtually, we 
look forward to further progress in securing the sustainability of the SBT fishery, both 
in terms of SBT and in terms of the impact that SBT fishing has on non-target species, 
seabirds in particular, which Members have agreed is the main incidental catch of 
concern. 
CCSBT fisheries have some of the highest albatross bycatch in the world. HSI has 
long advocated that CCSBT fulfil its duties under current international legal 
frameworks to remove the threat of extinction posed by the longline fishing it 
authorises.  
HSI is concerned the interim CCSBT Performance Review highlights the inability to 
address the impact of SBT fisheries on non-target species, in particular seabirds in 
light of the conservation crisis they are currently experiencing. HSI supports the 
recommendations focused on ecologically related species (ERS) and particularly 
seabirds in this review. It is clear that members must take this criticism seriously and 
give far greater priority to this issue. The results of the performance review must not 
be ignored. 
The use of Electronic Monitoring Systems (EMS) have the potential to be an 
important element for compliance and better ERS performance. HSI supports the use 
of EMS, and encourages its advancement, with a suggested initial primary objective 
in CCSBT of EMS for verifying mitigation measure compliance specifically, with the 
aim of consistency across relevant RFMO’s.  
Of all five tuna commissions CCSBT has the greatest overlap between its fisheries 
and albatrosses, yet currently, CCSBT only requires vessels to use bird scaring lines 
and to follow the seabird bycatch mitigation requirements of other tuna RFMOs. 
Improved mitigation measures across all RFMOs are urgently required due to 
continued very high rates of albatross bycatch in some CCSBT longline fleets, 
reported low levels of compliance with mitigation measure use and the lack of ability 
of CCSBT to undertake compliance actions under the current system.  
HSI again takes the opportunity to urge CCSBT to adopt binding requirements for 
vessels to use effective seabird bycatch mitigation measures, as a condition of access 
to the SBT fishery, and that these requirements reflect best practice bycatch mitigation 
as recommended by the Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels 
(ACAP). It should be noted that existing seabird bycatch mitigation measures of 
WCPFC, IOTC and ICCAT fall short of ACAP best practice advice, which includes 
more effective line weight specifications and the use of not two, but three measures in 
areas of highest albatross bycatch.   
In conclusion the EC is reminded that albatross populations are in serious decline and 
are declared to be facing a conservation crisis – and that longline fisheries in high risk 
areas, authorised by tuna RFMOs, continue to be the principal cause. In this final term 
for longstanding Executive Secretary Bob Kennedy, we would like to wish him a 
productive and successful term, and HSI looks forward to seeing CCSBT Members 
work to strengthen required mitigation measures and prevent noncompliance.  
Thank you Chair and Members for your time.

Process for Recruitment of a new Executive Secretary for the CCSBT 
 
It is proposed that the target commencement date of the new Executive Secretary be 
Monday 26 September 2022. This will provide approximately one month of overlap 
with the current Executive Secretary (ES) and it will also allow the new ES to attend 
the October 2022 annual meetings of the Compliance Committee and Extended 
Commission. It is further proposed that the recruitment process be conducted 
sufficiently early, so that if an international applicant is successful, that person can 
arrive in Canberra and commence work by the target commencement date. 
 
The following recruitment timetable is therefore proposed, noting that there may need 
to be some flexibility with the exact dates. Each step of the recruitment timetable is 
described in further detail after the table below. 
Task 
Completion Date in 2022 
1. Position Description and Selection Criteria agreed  
1 February (Tuesday) 
2. Position advertised  
4 February (Friday) 
3. Applications close  
4 March (Friday) 
4. Applications sent to Members by Secretariat 
7 March (Monday) 
5. Members Rank their top 5 preferred candidates for an 
interview and send to Sec  
25 March (Friday) 
6. Secretariat score the candidates and advise Members 
of the top 5 candidates to be interviewed  
29 March (Tuesday) 
7. Secretariat contact interviewees and notify them of 
interview date 
30-31 March (Wed.-Thu.) 
8. Conduct interviews and select preferred candidate 
11-14 April (Mon.-Thu.) 
9. Notify successful candidate 
19 April (Tuesday) 
 
(1) Position Description and Selection Criteria 
The Secretariat will circulate a draft position description, selection criteria and 
advertisement to Members for their consideration. Members will be asked to suggest 
changes to these documents and the Secretariat will circulate the agreed documents to 
Members by 1 February 2022.  
 
It is proposed that the ES position be open to all people, regardless of nationality. 
 
The advertisement will specify that applications are to be sent to the current ES. The 
current ES will also be the contact point for any questions in relation to the position. 
 
(2) Advertising the position 
The Secretariat will provide the agreed position description, selection criteria and 
advertisement to the Regional Secretariat Network for distribution to all RFMOs and 
to the IMCSN for distribution to its network. The Secretariat will also publish these 
documents on the CCSBT’s website and on the joint tuna RFMO website (www.tuna-
org.org). 
 
Members are asked to advertise the ES position domestically through newspapers or 
other appropriate means. Members may also wish to target people that they consider 
to be suitable for the position and provide the position information to those people. 
Furthermore, Members and the Secretariat are asked to distribute the advertisement 
and associated documents to any other interested parties. 
 
(3 & 4) Applications close & sent to Members 
No applications will be accepted after the closing date unless the closing date is 
extended.  
 
Applications will be treated confidentially, so the current ES will only email 
applications to Heads of Delegations (unless a Head of Delegation nominates a 
different person to receive this communication). 
 
(5, 6 & 7) Ranking and scoring of the top 5 candidates and notification of 
interviewees  
It is proposed that only five people be interviewed for the ES position. Members are 
therefore asked to rank their top 5 preferred candidates and provide those rankings to 
the current ES. 
 
The current ES will then sum all the ranks received1, advise Members of the top 5 
candidates that will be interviewed, and contact the candidates to set the interview 
dates. 
 
(8) Interviews and selection of the preferred candidate  
The CCSBT Chair (or the Vice-Chair if the Chair has not been nominated) will Chair 
the interviews as well as the session to select the preferred candidate after the 
interviews. If neither the Chair or Vice-Chair has been nominated, the 2022 CCSBT 
hosting Member (New Zealand) will Chair the interviews and the selection session. 
The interview panel will consist of one representative of each Member. The current 
ES will be present to provide support to the panel if requested by the Chair. 
 
The interviews will be conducted in English, either in-person or online via Zoom, 
depending on the practicalities at the time. The Chair of the interview panel will 
decide which approach to use after consulting with Members. Two interviews will be 
conducted each day and it is assumed that each interview will last for approximately 
1-1.5 hours. 
 
It is envisaged that all prepared interview questions will be read out by the Chair. This 
will be the most efficient approach for an on-line interview. To assist with this 
process, interview panel members are asked to send any questions they have to the 
Chair at least two weeks prior to the interviews. The Chair may amalgamate similar 
questions from different panellists and may add additional questions. About one week 
before the interviews, the Chair will send panellists a copy of all the questions that the 
Chair will ask. All interview questions will be treated as being confidential to the 
panel. During each interview, panellists will be allowed to ask follow-up questions of 
each candidate. 
 
Once the interviews are complete, a final Zoom session will be held to select the 
preferred candidate. Selection of the preferred candidate will be by consensus of the 
 
1 Giving “5” to each Member’s top ranked candidate and “1” to their fifth ranked candidate. 
panellists present at this selection session. Second and third preferences will also be 
decided by the panel in case the preferred candidate does not accept the offer. 
 
(9) Notification to successful candidate  
The current ES will notify the preferred candidate and offer the ES position to that 
candidate. If that candidate declines the offer, the current ES will contact the second 
and third (if necessary) preferences of the selection panel. The Chair will sign a 
contract with the successful candidate. 
 
 
 
Attachment 7 
 
Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
Mr Dominic Vallières (New Zealand) agreed to chair the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC). The FAC was tasked with the following agenda:  
• Revision of the 2021 budget;  
• Drafting of the 2022 budget; and  
• Drafting of the indicative budgets for 2023 and 2024 
 
The revised budget for 2021 
The Executive Secretary provided a summary of the 2021 revised budget prior to the 
meeting and FAC Members were asked to provide initial comments at that time. 
Details of the revised budget are also outlined in CCSBT-EC/2110/05. The revision 
incorporates actual income and expenditure together with forecast income and 
expenditure for the remainder of the year.  
Expenditures for 2021 are forecast to total $2,331,000, which is a 21.2% decrease on 
the amount approved for 2021. Once again, this year, many of the reduced 
expenditures were a direct result of the global pandemic and its impact on the 
operations of this Commission (e.g., the replacement of physical meetings with virtual 
forums). 
All Members have paid their 2021 contributions to the CCSBT in full and the only 
outstanding amount that remains is the $5,539 owed by South Africa to repay the 
Secretariat’s purchase of CDS tags in 2021.  
The forecasted income for the Extended Commission was slightly lower than 
anticipated due to a reduction in returns from the Staff Assessment Levy1 and a 
reduction on returns from investments due to reduced interest rates. 
Members of the FAC thanked the Secretariat for the revised budget and endorsed it. 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission note the revised budget for 
2021 at Annex A. 
 
Draft budget for 2022 
The FAC considered the proposed budgets outlined in CCSBT-EC/2110/06, which 
includes funding for the CCSBT’s usual business.  
This draft budget has been developed under the assumption that, with the exception of 
the March 2022 ERSWG meeting, physical meetings will resume in 2022. However, 
 
1 The Staff Assessment Levy appears on both the income and expenditure side of the budget and 
therefore has no net effect. 
the FAC recognises that these expenses will be significantly lower if Members are 
once again forced to use virtual means to meet. 
In its presentation of the draft 2022 budget, the Executive Secretary noted that current 
contribution levels are not sufficient to cover the annual running costs of the CCSBT 
and that the freeze on Member contributions that was suggested at last year’s FAC 
can only be achieved by using carry-over and savings from previous years. However, 
the savings available to the Commission will not sustain this practice and an increase 
in Member contributions will be required in 2023 and beyond. 
Members of the FAC expressed concerns about the potential fiscal risks associated 
with the current disparity between income and revenue and chose to explore a number 
of differing scenarios for Member contributions.  
Members of the FAC considered three potential scenarios for Member contributions: 
an increase of 1%; an increase of 2%; and a scenario which retains the current 
contribution level. Some Members expressed a strong preference for a 2% increase 
noting the Executive Secretary’s comments regarding current expenses exceeding 
income. One Member requested additional time to consult with their finance officials 
and asked that the final decision on Member contributions level be deferred to 
plenary. 
The draft budget for 2022, presented in paper CCSBT-EC/2110/06,  
contained $139,331 more expenditure than the interim draft budget for 2022 that was 
provided in Circular #2021/051. This increased expenditure was related to the 
inclusion of the following new items from the updated Extended Scientific Committee 
(ESC) workplan: 
• An eTagging design study; 
• Participation of the CPUE consultant at the OMMP meeting; 
• Deferring OMMP maintenance and development work from 2021 to 2022; 
• Increasing the effort for development of the CPUE series in 2022; and 
• A workshop to progress the Scientific Research Planning process. 
In addition to the above, some expenditures related to Secretariat staff leave were 
deferred from 2021 to 2022. 
Indonesia asked that Members consider making funding available to support the 
participation of developing States at technical meetings (e.g. ERSWG and OMMP) 
noting that other RFMOs have established such mechanisms. Members asked for 
greater detail around this proposal including on the potential eligibility criteria that 
would be applied in order to access these funds. Indonesia agreed to develop a paper 
ahead of the next EC to better define the proposal. 
In discussion with the Chair of the ESC, the FAC considered the proposed workplan 
from the ESC. The ESC Chair provided additional context to FAC members, focusing 
primarily on the eTagging design study and its relative importance to the wider 
research program and associated potential benefits. 
Members of the FAC recognised the potential benefits of this work to the wider 
science process but also expressed some reservations about the financial impacts it 
could carry both now and potentially in future years.  
Some Members were inclined to defer the project for a year noting the work taking 
place more broadly on the development of a Scientific Research Plan while others 
expressed a preference for immediate inclusion of the design study within the 2022 
budget. Ultimately, FAC members were unable to reach consensus on either of these 
two options and we now ask that the final decision be made in plenary. 
The budget for 2022 assumes that interviews for the Executive Secretary position will 
be conducted virtually. However, the Extended Commission has agreed that the 
interviews may be conducted in-person depending on the practicalities at the time. 
This would result in additional costs to fly interviewees (and potentially the Executive 
Secretary) to New Zealand and to provide their accommodation. The FAC 
recommends that the Executive Secretary be authorised to make these payments, 
which would exceed the budget, if it is decided to hold in-person interviews. 
 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission approve the 2022 General 
Budget as set out in Annex B to this document noting that a final decision on both 
Member contributions and the eTagging design project will need to be made in 
plenary.  
 
Indicative budgets for 2023 and 2024 
The FAC was also asked to consider indicative budgets for the two years beyond the 
upcoming budget. 
Most expenses within the indicative budgets represent ongoing commitments and did 
not require significant change from the FAC with the exception of a potential 
additional meeting of the ERSWG in 2023  
Members of the FAC did note the general uncertainty related to this Commission’s 
ability to hold physical meetings and its potential impact on estimated costs. The FAC 
has currently budgeted future meetings under the assumption that physical meetings 
will become the norm once again but recognises that savings will occur should this 
Commission require virtual meetings. 
The FAC wishes to highlight that under all the funding scenarios considered, an 
increase of Member contributions will be required from 2023 onwards unless 
significant reductions in expenses are achieved.The FAC recommends that the 
Extended Commission note the indicative 2023 and 2024 budgets as set out in Annex 
B recognising once more that the final decision in plenary on the eTagging design 
study may influence its final composition.

Attachment 10 
Resolution to Align CCSBT’s Ecologically Related Species measures 
with those of other tuna RFMOs 
(Updated at the Twenty Eighth Annual Meeting – 11-13 October 2021) 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
Recalling the decision made at the 5th Strategy and Fisheries Management Working 
Group Meeting to develop a binding Ecological Related Species (ERS) measure for 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) Members 
without duplicating the effort of other tuna RFMOs by creating a CCSBT Resolution 
that requires CCSBT Members to follow the ERS measures of other relevant tuna 
RFMOs, 
Noting the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation 
and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the 
need to cooperate and ensure consistency between conservation and management 
measures in the different tuna regional fisheries management organisations, 
Concerned that some seabird species, notably some albatrosses and petrels, are 
threatened with global extinction, 
Mindful that fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna can also cause incidental harm to other 
species such as sea turtles, sharks and cetaceans, 
Further recalling the requirement in Article 5(2) of the Convention for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna that the Parties shall expeditiously provide to 
the CCSBT data on, inter alia, ecologically related species, 
Determined to mitigate incidental harm to ecologically related species caused by fishing 
for Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
Noting the importance of harmonising conservation and management measures with 
other organisations responsible for managing international fisheries, as agreed at the 
Kobe Meeting of Joint Tuna RFMOs on 26 January 2007, 
Reaffirming the recommendation at the seventh meeting of the Ecologically Related 
Species Working Group (ERSWG) held in Tokyo from 3 to 6 July 2007, that Members 
and Cooperating Non-Members will provide national reports on their interactions with 
ecologically related species in Southern Bluefin Tuna fisheries to the ERSWG, 
Agrees in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8, that: 
1. For the purposes of this CCSBT Resolution:
a) the ‘Area of Competence of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission’ is that
described in Article 2 of the Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian
Ocean Tuna Commission;
b) the ‘Convention Area of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 
Commission’ is that described in Article 3 of the Convention on the 
Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western 
and Central Pacific Ocean;  
c) the ‘Convention Area of the International Commission for the Conservation of 
Atlantic Tunas’ is that described in Article 1 of the International Convention 
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas;  
d) An Area defined in paragraphs a) – c) above is an “Area of Competence” and 
are collectively the “Areas of Competence”;  
e) ‘ERS Measures’ mean all measures relating to ecologically related species in 
force in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), the Western and Central 
Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the International Commission for the 
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), as adopted and amended from time 
to time, as contained in Annex I; 
f) Member or Cooperating Non-Member means a Member or Cooperating Non-
Member of the Extended Commission of the CCSBT. 
 
2. This Resolution shall apply to all vessels on the ‘CCSBT Record of fishing vessels 
authorised to fish for Southern Bluefin Tuna’ in the Areas of Competence. Each 
Member and Cooperating Non-Member shall ensure that such vessels flying its flag 
and fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area of Competence comply with all 
ERS Measures in force in that Area of Competence (whether or not the Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member is a member of the tuna RFMO in which the ERS 
Measures were adopted). 
 
3. When fishing outside Areas of Competence, Members and Cooperating Non-
Members shall use Tori lines in all long-line SBT fisheries below 30 degrees south. 
 
4. Where Areas of Competence overlap, Members and Cooperating Non-Members 
shall elect which applicable RFMO’s ERS Measures to apply.  
 
5. Each Member and Cooperating Non-Member shall ensure that effective action is 
taken in response to a vessel flying its flag that fails to comply with the obligations 
contained in the ERS Measures when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area 
of Competence. If a Member or Cooperating Non-Member of the Extended 
Commission undertakes fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area of 
Competence of a Convention of which it is not a Member, that Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member shall report, if any, such actions relating to the relevant 
ERS Measures to the Compliance Committee of the CCSBT, unless the compliance 
of that Member or Cooperating Non-Member with such ERS measures is assessed 
in the appropriate body of that Convention.  
 
6. The CCSBT secretariat will annually update the list of ERS Measures contained in 
Annex I before the CCSBT Extended Commission Meeting according to any 
decisions taken on ecologically related species at the Annual Meetings of the IOTC, 
WCPFC, and ICCAT. 
 
7. Except in the case of WCPFC, Members and Cooperating Non-Members that have 
formally objected to an ERS Measure in the relevant tuna RFMO, and who, by 
reason of that formal objection and the operation of the tuna RFMO’s decision-
making rules, are not bound by that ERS Measure, are exempted from applying that 
ERS Measure when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in the applicable Area of 
Competence. In the case of WCPFC, Members and Cooperating Members that have 
sought a review of a decision on an ERS measure in accordance with Article 20, 
paragraph 6 of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly 
Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean are exempted from 
applying that ERS Measure when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in the 
applicable Area of Competence until the Measure becomes binding. 
 
8. The Secretariat shall annually present a report to the CCSBT Compliance 
Committee on the implementation of the ERS Measures, for the sole purpose of the 
provision of information for Members and Cooperating Non-Members.

1.1 
Adoption of the Agenda 
1.2 
Adoption of Document List 
1.3 
Appointment of Rapporteurs 
Members will be asked to nominate rapporteurs for agenda items 4-6.  In addition, 
presenters of papers will be asked to provide a brief paragraph for papers they have 
presented (excluding annual reports) for inclusion in the report of the meeting. 
 
2. Annual reports 
Members will prepare and provide annual reports to the ERSWG in accordance with the agreed 
template.  Reports are expected to contain all information specified in the template. In accordance 
with the ERSWG’s workplan, the Secretariat will use Members’ data to also produce Table 1 from 
the template as a trial. It will be assumed that reports have been read by participants prior to the 
meeting, so this agenda item will be reserved for questions of clarification regarding the reports. 
2.1 
Members 
2.2 
Secretariat report on the ERSWG Data Exchange 
The Secretariat will provide summaries of the data from the annual ERSWG Data 
Exchange1. This agenda item also provides an opportunity to consider changes in relation to 
the data exchange process and associated information. 
 
3. Reports of meetings and/or outcomes of other organisations relevant to the ERS 
Working Group 
All organisations with long terms observer status for CCSBT ERSWG meetings (see 
https://www.ccsbt.org/en/content/attendance-meetings-observers) will be invited to attend and to 
present a report to the meeting.  Members and observers may also present relevant meeting reports 
from organisations not present at the ERSWG meeting. The ERSWG will consider relevant 
recommendations of these reports.  
 
4. Review of progress with the work program from ERSWG 13  
The work program from ERSWG 13 is provided at Attachment A. The ERSWG will review progress 
with the work program..  
 
5. Information and advice on ERS  
This is the key agenda item to progress the assessment of the risks to ERS posed by fishing for SBT 
and the effects of ERS on the condition of the SBT stock, and to provide advice on any measures 
that might be needed for the mitigation of risks. Members and observers are requested to develop 
and submit papers in advance of the meeting on the following agenda items.   
 
1 Members that wish to conduct their own analysis of these data can obtain an amalgamated spreadsheet of these 
data from the “ERSWG Data Exchange” section of the “General Private Area” of the CCSBT website. A highly 
aggregated public version of the data is available at https://www.ccsbt.org/userfiles/file/data/ERSWG_Data.xlsx.  
 
5.1 
Seabirds 
5.1.1 Information on stock status 
In accordance with standing instructions, the Secretariat will request ACAP and 
Birdlife International to provide updated information on the seabirds likely to be 
caught by SBT fisheries, including population status summaries and reviews of 
mitigations measures. 
5.1.2 Estimates of ERS mortality and associated uncertainty 
This agenda item provides an opportunity to consider methods for estimating total 
seabird mortality and for reviewing any mortality estimates provided by Members. 
5.1.3 Ecological risk assessment 
The ERSWG 13 work program specifies that New Zealand will lead work, with 
collaboration from Members, to update the seabird Ecological Risk Assessment, 
together with updated identification of high-risk areas for ERSWG 14. The ERSWG 
will review the outcome of this work. 
5.1.4 Assessment and advice on mitigation measures 
This is a standing item on the ERSWG agenda for the ERSWG to review current 
measures and provide advice on any changes that might be needed.  
5.1.5 Use of new 5*5 by quarter data 
The ERSWG 13 work program specifies that New Zealand will investigate the use of 
the new 5*5 by quarter data provided for the modified ERSWG Data Exchange, for 
analyses of issues relating to seabird bycatch. 
5.1.6 Seabird species identification 
Updates on any improvements in seabird identification practices or methodology. 
5.1.7 Multi-year seabird strategy 
ERSWG 13 developed the overall objective and five specific objectives for the CCSBT 
Multi-year Seabird Strategy. CCSBT 26 adopted these objectives. ERSWG 13’s work 
program specifies that Australia, with collaboration from all Members, will develop a 
revised draft list of strategic actions under each of the specific objectives of the 
Multi-year seabird strategy for ERSWG 14.  The ERSWG will discuss the draft 
strategic actions. 
5.2 
Sharks 
5.2.1 Information on stock status 
Members should provide information on the stock status of shark species relevant to 
the CCSBT. 
5.2.3 Estimates of ERS mortality and associated uncertainty 
This agenda item provides an opportunity to consider methods for estimating total 
shark mortality and for reviewing any mortality estimates provided by Members. 
5.3 
Other ERS 
Members and observers are encouraged to present information concerning the impacts of 
fishing for SBT on other ERS such as sea turtles and marine mammals etc.  
 
6. Education and public relations activities 
This is a highly important agenda item to ensure full implementation of agreed mitigation 
measures. Education and public relation activities conducted by Members should be covered under 
agenda item 2, so they should not need to be discussed here.  This agenda item is intended for 
discussion of any new activities that should be conducted by the CCSBT to enhance mitigation 
and/or data collection in relation to ERS. This will include an update on the “Project proposal for 
enhancing education on and implementation of Ecologically Related Species seabird measures 
within CCSBT fisheries” which has been developed jointly between the CCSBT and BirdLife 
International. 
 
7. Consideration of recommendations from the Performance Review of the CCSBT 
The report of the CCSBT Performance Review is scheduled to be submitted on 1 March 2022. The 
ERSWG will consider recommendations relating to ERS and provide the EC with feedback from the 
ERSWG on these specific recommendations. 
 
8. How to improve the CCSBT’s focus on seabird bycatch 
EC28 agreed that ERS bycatch, in particular seabirds, was an important issue that needed more 
focus, and annual ERSWG meetings would help to provide that. Some Members noted that this 
would be an extra burden on relevant officials and scientists and they were not ready to agree to 
annual meetings. It was also noted that virtual meetings could complement physical meetings to 
help reduce costs. The EC requested that the ERSWG consider the need for annual meetings and 
provide advice to the EC on how CCSBT’s focus on ERS can be improved, particularly on seabird 
bycatch. 
 
9. Future work program 
The ERSWG will develop an updated work program from matters raised during the previous 
agenda items together with any additional work items that need to be considered. 
 
10. Other business 
 
11. Referral of ERS matters for consideration by CCSBT subsidiary bodies 
This agenda item is for matters that the ERSWG considers should be specifically referred to other 
subsidiary bodies of the CCSBT.   
 
12. Recommendations and advice to the Extended Commission 
The ERSWG will develop a list of recommendation and advice to the Extended Commission from 
matters raised during the previous agenda items.
