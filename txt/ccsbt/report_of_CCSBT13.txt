Welcome Address 
By Akira Nakamae 
 
Chairman, ladies and gentleman, welcome to this meeting.  
 
Japan hosted CCSBT 8 at Miyako in 2001.  It is my great pleasure to host the thirteenth 
meeting of the CCSBT in Miyazaki. 
 
First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Secretariat for so much effort in 
organizing this meeting.  I am sure that there have been difficult tasks to organize this meeting.  
We are very grateful to have such a wonderful setting and arrangements for the meeting. 
 
I also would like to take this opportunity to extend my genuine appreciation to Prefecture of 
Miyazaki and Miyazaki City.  As you can see, this venue is an excellent facility.  Without 
support from Prefecture of Miyazaki and Miyazaki City, we could not have this meeting here. 
 
In this occasion, I would like to explain thoughts of Japan regarding this meeting. 
 
The sustainable utilization of the SBT stock is the common and most important goal for all 
CCSBT members.  However, there is concern about deterioration of the SBT stock.  CCSBT is 
requested to take measures to cope with this problem so that CCSBT can make steps toward the 
recovery of the SBT stock. 
 
As a country which has utilized the SBT stock for a long time and as the largest SBT consumer 
nation, I would like to emphasize our strong will and responsibility to make every effort for the 
recovery of the SBT stock. 
 
Japan conducted an investigation on its own initiative last year, and we disclosed that we 
exceeded our SBT allocation in the 2005 fishing season.  In order to eliminate causes of such 
excess catch, from this April, we moved to a new SBT management scheme, which includes 
allocation to individual fishing vessel and tagging of individually caught SBT.  As this new 
scheme covers whole processes from catch to landing, we are able to eliminate uncertainties in 
fisheries. 
 
 
When this new scheme was introduced, I faced great difficulties to convince stakeholders, 
including fishermen.  However, introduction of this new scheme was imperative and 
indispensable for us, and we exerted our utmost effort. 
 
Furthermore, in order to make this new scheme effective, we increased the number of JFA 
inspectors at port so that 100% SBT landing inspection can be done.  I can promise you that 
Japan will strictly comply with its national allocation determined at CCSBT, and the new scheme 
is a clear answer to criticisms against our SBT fisheries.  I would like you to fully understand 
the new scheme, and I hope that all CCSBT Members will introduce the tagging system to 
improve the management of SBT. 
 
There are some difficulties in the track record of the catch in some fisheries.  There are 
Longliner, Purse seiner and Pole and line fisheries for SBT.  For Long liner and Pole and line, it 
is possible to measure weight of individual SBT at the time of catch.  However, Purse seiner is 
different from longline and pole and line fisheries.  There is no landing at the time of catch, and 
catches by purse seine are transferred to farming pens.  Some kind of effort is necessary to 
obtain accurate estimated catch by purse seine.  It is desirable to develop appropriate 
management methodologies for each type of fishery taking into account their characteristics. 
 
Since last year’s annual meeting, meetings of two independent review panels, the Special 
Meeting, and the Scientific Committee were hold in order to solve uncertainties in certain 
fisheries.  There still remain many uncertainties; however, as the Scientific Committee pointed 
out, it is imperative to start taking action to recover the SBT stock.  We cannot leave the 
situation by using uncertainties as an excuse.  We need to take measure as responsible 
Members. 
 
As the largest longlining fishery country, we are ready to take initiative in this endeavor.  There 
is no point in having discussion without any decision.  I hope that the other members will join 
our efforts for the recovery of the SBT stock. 
 
In concluding, I hope that you will have a pleasant time and enjoy this beautiful autumn in 
Miyazaki. 
 
Thank you.

1 
10. The Executive Secretary introduced his replacement, Mr Neil Hermes, who 
commences duty on 16 October.  The Chair welcomed Mr Hermes on behalf of the 
Extended Commission.  Mr Hermes thanked the Extended Commission for its 
confidence in him and advised that he was looking forward to assisting the Extended 
Commission in managing this important resource. 
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Handling Confidential Matters Concerning the CCSBT 
11. Japan raised its grave concern that the confidentiality of documents agreed at the 
July Special Meeting had been broken by the Australian Fisheries Management 
Authority’s Managing Director, Richard McLoughlin.  He made a one-side and 
partial presentation containing information of the anomalies mentioned in the market 
review report and this was reported in the media. 
12. Australia acknowledged the breach of confidentiality and apologised for the incident 
and advised that the person involved had been counselled and its officials in general 
have been instructed to be more careful in the future. 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Finance and Administration 
4.1 Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
13. The Executive Secretary presented a revised budget for 2006 (CCSBT-ESC/0610/05) 
and proposed budgets for 2007 (CCSBT-ESC/0610/06). 
14. The Executive Secretary outlined the assumptions underpinning the budgets. The 
Extended Commission referred the draft budgets to the Finance and Administration 
Committee for consideration and report back to the Extended Commission. It was 
noted that the budgets might have to be modified in the light of discussions during 
the course of the meeting on activities in 2007.  Australia foreshadowed in particular, 
a possible need to include funding for new monitoring, control and surveillance 
measures. 
15.  The Finance and Administration Committee (FAC) was convened to consider the 
revised budget for 2006 and the proposed budget for 2007.  New Zealand was 
nominated to chair the FAC and Australia acted as rapporteur. 
16. The FAC considered and endorsed the revised budget for 2006 incorporated in 
meeting document CCSBT-EC/0610/05.  The FAC recommended that the identified 
over-expenditure in that report be absorbed.  The Extended Commission adopted the 
revised budget for 2006. 
17. The FAC considered the proposed budget for 2007 and noted that an additional 
$45,000 was required to cover the Compliance Committee special meeting agreed to 
at CCSBT 13.  Further, because of costs associated with new monitoring, control and 
surveillance (MCS) measures agreed at CCSBT 13, cost savings were investigated in 
the other elements of the proposed budget. Savings endorsed by the FAC are: 
2 
• Decreased meeting costs, primarily through reductions in publication costs, 
equipment hire and miscellaneous costs (e.g. by self catering meetings where 
possible, hosts providing venues free). 
• A decrease in the number of panellists from four to three participating in the SC 
and SAG unless other measures to reduce expenditure can be found. 
• No purchase of tags for the CCSBT tagging programme in 2007.  
• No Interim Management Procedure Workshop. 
• No management strategy development. 
18. The Extended Commission accepted the revised general budget for 2007 as shown in 
Attachment 7 Table 1. 
19. The FAC also noted that an additional cost of $100,000 will be required to support 
the employment of a person in the Secretariat to develop the MCS measures agreed 
at CCSBT13. The FAC advise that if a small reduction was made in the number of 
vessel days in the SRP tagging programme, the subsequent savings could be made 
available for this new requirement.  
20. The Extended Commission accepted the revised special budget for 2007 as shown in 
Attachment 7 Table 2. The Extended Commission also agreed that up to $100,000 
could be transferred from the special budget to the general budget to support the 
employment a person in the Secretariat to develop the MCS measures agreed at 
CCSBT13.  
21. With respect to the indicative 2008 budget, the FAC recommended that it be 
increased to reflect a 10% increase in member contributions. 
 
4.2 Discussion on Finance Issues 
22. In considering the FAC report, Australia drew the meeting’s attention to the 
conclusions of the Extended Scientific Committee that, “there was increased reliance 
on a smaller suite of indicators (Aerial Survey, conventional tagging, NZ charter 
fleet and Indonesia catch monitoring) due to the impact of the catch anomalies on the 
level of confidence on the fisheries dependent indicators, in particular the Japanese 
longline CPUE”. 
23. In light of this the ESC had recommended that to ensure verifiable and reliable 
indicators are available, the highest priority should be given to the following set: 
catch and CPUE verification, aerial surveys, Indonesian monitoring, and tagging 
together with verification of reporting rates. 
24. Australia stated that the Aerial Survey has direct tangible benefits for all members of 
the Commission global fishery; especially given that it is now the sole reliable 
indicator of juvenile abundance in the global fishery and will cost $545,000 in 2007.  
The cost of the Aerial Survey has been funded solely by Australia for the past 2 
years and is an element of the scientific research budget for SBT that is funded by 
the Australian Government.  Australia believes that all members should contribute to 
this critically important research. 
3 
25. It is a fundamental principle that all those who participate and benefit from the 
fishery contribute to the scientific understanding and management of the fishery. 
26. Australia wanted a clear understanding by all Members that this is a vitally important 
component of the CCSBT Scientific Research Program (SRP). 
27. Depending on the outcome of the SRP review next year by the ESC, Australia wants 
to ensure that the Aerial Survey is included in next year’s budget. 
28. Agreement could not be reached for assistance from other Members for payment of 
the cost of the Aerial Survey this year and Australia agreed to continue to pay the 
full cost of the Aerial Survey, but indicated the ESC must provide a clear indication 
of the priority of scientific activities in full for consideration at CCSBT 14. 
29. The Commission welcomed Australia’s substantial contribution to the scientific 
work of the Commission and their support of the Aerial Survey. 
30. New Zealand advised the meeting that the data from the New Zealand charter fleet 
was also considered by the Extended Scientific Committee to be an important 
reliable indicator for monitoring recruitment.  Its reliability is related to the 100% 
observer coverage of this fleet.  This observer coverage costs New Zealand up to 
$200,000 per year. 
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Compliance 
5.1 Report from the Compliance Committee 
31. The Chair of the Compliance Committee (CC Chair) presented the report of the 
Compliance Committee (which is at Attachment 8).  He advised that: 
• Members of the Compliance Committee recognised that extensive levels of 
unreported catch demanded significant improvement in the measures needed to 
better monitor catch and raise the levels of compliance with the conservation and 
management measures of the CCSBT. 
• The meeting received over 20 formal reports, presentations and proposals. 
• The Chair of the Scientific Committee reported on discussions at the Extended 
Scientific Committee meeting and emphasised the importance of reliability of 
catch and effort data. 
• The Extended Scientific Committee provided advice to the Compliance 
Committee on the essential nature and statistical accuracy of information 
(paragraphs 62-68 of the SC11 report). 
32. The CC Chair noted that the Committee set itself an ambitious task to undertake in 
the available time.  It placed particular emphasis on the development of proposals on 
an integrated package of Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) measures  He 
advised that: 
4 
• Australia presented details of eight MCS measures to the Compliance Committee, 
and proposed draft resolutions to carry out work on each of these and a proposed 
implementation date on each of these: 
o an effective catch documentation scheme (CDS); 
o use of genetic techniques to complement other monitoring, control and 
surveillance (MCS) measures; 
o implementation of a centralised vessel monitoring system (VMS);  
o an international observer program; 
o vessel registers; 
o regulation of transhipment;  
o boarding and inspection of vessels; and 
o port state measures. 
• New Zealand presented a paper outlining various approaches for strengthening 
compliance, and a separate paper proposing development of an effective catch 
documentation scheme. 
• Japan outlined its new domestic MCS arrangements, which included allocation of 
quota for individual vessel and tagging of Japanese caught SBT at the time of 
catch.  Japan proposed two resolutions: 
o proposal on CCSBT New Tagging System; and 
o proposal on management and compliance measures on SBT farming. 
• The Compliance Committee agreed to focus on four of these proposals as key 
priorities: 
o CDS and tagging of individual fish as a cornerstone of the CDS; 
o VMS; 
o Independent Observer program; and 
o Regulation of transhipment. 
33. The CC Chair commented that there was insufficient time to complete the 
development of resolutions on these proposals and recommended to the Commission 
that further work be undertaken during CCSBT 13.  The CCSBT13 meeting was 
subsequently adjourned to allow the Compliance Committee Working Group 
(CCWG) to address the 4 high priority proposals and consider how these could be 
further progressed for implementation. 
34. The CCWG developed 3 draft resolutions for consideration by the Extended 
Commission.  These papers are in relation to development of a catch documentation 
scheme (Attachment 9), a vessel monitoring system (Attachment 10), and 
transhipments at sea by large scale longline fishing vessels (Attachment 11).  The 
CCWG was unable to reach agreement on the proposal to establish an independent 
observer program.   
35. The CC Chair advised that, if adopted by the Extended Commission, the 3 draft 
resolutions require considerable work before they can be implemented.  It is 
proposed that this work be undertaken intersessionaly and at a Compliance 
5 
Committee Working Group meeting in mid 2007.  Some Members proposed that 
further work be undertaken on: 
• Observer Program. 
• Vessel Register . 
• Port State Measures . 
• Boarding and Inspection. 
 
5.2 Integrated Monitoring, Control and Surveillance System 
36. Members, Cooperating Non-Members and Observers recognised the critical 
importance of adopting and fully implementing at the earliest possible time an 
integrated package of compliance measures which would ensure the elimination of 
unreported catch and provide accurate data as a basis for proper stock assessment. 
37. In particular, Members adopted three resolutions on the following compliance 
measures: 
• A catch documentation scheme (Attachment 9). 
• A vessel monitoring system (Attachment 10). 
• Regulation of transhipments by large scale fishing vessels (Attachment 11). 
38. Noting that implementation of the above three measures would require considerable 
work, and that there had been insufficient time to reach agreement on other 
important measures such as an independent observer program, port state measures, 
boarding and inspection, and a vessel register, Members agreed to undertake further 
work  intersessionally and at a Compliance Committee meeting in mid-2007.  
Members agreed to refer the proposal on use of genetics in verifying tuna species 
and legal origin of catch to the Extended Scientific Committee. 
39. The Extended Commission further agreed, in order to improve transparency of and 
confidence in management measures, that all Members and Cooperating Non-
Members shall provide to the CCSBT Secretariat in a timely manner information 
relating to: 
a) the yearly quota and catch allocation arrangements for this fishery either by 
company, quota holder or vessel1; and 
b) the final catch against quota by company, quota holder or vessel at the 
completion of a vessel’s fishing period or fishing year. 
40. In the case where Members and Cooperating Non-Members manage through an 
“Olympic” system members shall only be required to report details in (b). 
41. Recognising the value of the Japanese Tagging System in improving compliance in 
the Fishery, the Extended Commission agreed to cooperate in developing this 
proposal further to apply as soon as practicable to all CCSBT Members and 
Cooperating Non-Members. 
                                                 
1 Vessel details provided shall include vessel name and call sign

Australian SBT Farming Study 
42. The Japanese delegation indicated that the uncertainties raised in the Independent 
Review of the Australian Farm Operations require further investigation.  Japan 
requests Australia to investigate the following issues as a flag-state responsibility.  
Japan would like the following issues clarified. 
a.  Representativeness of the 40 fish samples, which are used to estimate catch 
(bias in 40 fish sample); and 
b. Weight change during towing; 
c.  Accuracy in counting of dead fish during towing; 
d. Accuracy in growth rate during farming; and 
e.  Number of fish transferred into farming pens. 
43. Members recognise that in relation to items (b) and (d):  
• That intra- and inter-seasonal variability will require experiments to take place 
over a number of seasons with appropriate replication.  This is likely to take place 
over a minimum three year period and require the use of the research mortality 
allowance. 
• Different farming practices (such as feeding regimes, husbandry practices, harvest 
timing) will have an effect on growth rate and this will have a large impact on the 
experimental design and confidence intervals given the number of variations that 
would need to be considered.   
• The most effective approach is to ensure that there is an accurate estimate of 
weight of the fish at capture which will negate the need to examine different 
farming practices. 
However, the seasonal results will be reported. 
44. Australia will endeavour to complete work on the experimental design and 
experimental work as soon as practicable with an emphasis on finalizing (a), (c) and 
(e) in the first year.  The schedule for this work is: 
• Australia submits a draft initial experimental design to address the issues raised to 
other CCSBT members  - end November 2006 
• Comments from other CCSBT members - end December 2006 
• Finalise initial experimental design – mid January 2007 
• Finalise tender for experimental project – end February 2007 
• Implementation of experimental approach – February 2007 
• Submission of initial results to Commission – May 2007 
• Submission of revised experimental design – July 2007 
• Examination of results and revised design by ESC – September 2007 
• Examination of the results by the Extended Commission – October 2007 
• Second year study commences 1 December 2007 
7 
• Annual report prepared each July for consideration by Extended Scientific 
Committee. 
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Review of SBT Fisheries 
45. Reports on the SBT fisheries of Members of the Extended Commission are provided 
at Attachment 12.  There were no questions on these reports. 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
46. The SC Chair presented an overview of the key conclusions of the report of the 11th 
Scientific Committee Meeting (SC11).  The SC11 Report is shown in Attachment 
13, and the overview presentation is shown in Attachment 14.  Key conclusions 
were: 
• The suggested magnitude of past over-catches jeopardizes many of the key SBT 
indicators, undermines the basis upon which the SBT Operating model is 
designed and conditioned, and will require the proposed SBT MP to be re-
evaluated. 
• There is high uncertainty regarding the plausibility of alternate past catch 
scenarios.  Given this uncertainty, the SAG could not conduct a formal 
assessment in 2006.  Rather, a range of alternate ‘scenarios’ was evaluated, using 
the Operating Model under different assumptions about past catches and CPUE. 
• Results of scenario evaluations are generally consistent with the 2005 assessment, 
and indicate that the SBT spawning biomass is at a low fraction of its original 
biomass, well below the 1980 level, and below the level that could produce MSY.  
Scenarios show median spawning biomass levels in 2006 (110,000t -170,000t), 
well above 2005 median biomass estimate (50,000t estimated in 2005) as a result 
of the incorporation of catch anomalies, but still show substantial depletion, with 
median B2006/B0 levels between 10% and 13%. 
• Under these scenarios, the estimated catch levels that will result in meeting the 
short term target of a 50% probability of biomass in 2014 being greater than the 
biomass in 2004, lie in a relatively narrow range from approximately 9,900t to 
approximately 12,100t. 
• To ensure a high probability of sustainability and rebuilding of the SBT spawning 
stock, three steps are required: 
o An immediate reduction in total catches to below 14,925t to decrease the 
probability of further stock declines.   
o Immediate action to restore confidence in estimates of total catch and CPUE 
series.  Monitoring of recruitment and of the Indonesian fishery must continue, 
and where possible, be improved.    
8 
o An interim management procedure needs to be adopted within the next 3-5 
years, with a full management procedure thereafter designed to ensure a high 
probability of stock rebuilding. 
 
The SC Chair provided the following answers to questions from members: 
47. Australia asked what might the state of the SBT stock be if the indicated over-
catches had not occurred: 
• The SC Chair noted that this question had been asked at CCSBT12, and 
forwarded to the Advisory Panel.  However, it could not be addressed until there 
was some advice from the Commission regarding possible magnitudes and 
sources of past over-catches.  Following selection of the scenarios to evaluate at 
SC11, the SC Chair again posed this question to the Panel.  Limited time 
precluded the Panel from addressing the question at SC11.  However, Dr Parma 
had subsequently conducted a first preliminary retrospective analysis, using just 
one central scenario (scenario-c) under one set of central assumptions for the 
operating model parameters, to try and answer the question.  Assuming 
recruitment remained unchanged from the estimates used in 2006 the spawning 
stock would be at 19% of its estimated unfished level, as opposed to the current 
estimate of 11%, under this scenario (scenario c). This estimate equates to 58% of 
the estimated 1980 level. Alternatively, assuming that recruitment increased as a 
result of the increase in spawning biomass, the estimated spawning biomass 
would be 29% of the estimated unfished level. That is, two and a half times higher 
than the current estimate under this particular scenario. This equates to 88% of the 
estimated 1980 level. 
48. Australia questioned the feasibility of establishing a credible scientific process 
within the next 3 years to assess the SBT stock: 
• The SC Chair advised that this will depend on provision of accurate total catch 
data (or at least catch data of known uncertainty), plus a reliable index of longline 
CPUE over representative SBT distribution by area and age-class.  The SC also 
hoped to develop an interim management procedure over this time. 
49. Japan asked whether conservation and management of SBT could be done using 
numbers, rather than weight: 
• The SC Chair responded that input data for assessments can be dealt with in either 
in numbers or weight, but will have to be accompanied by adequate representative 
size-frequency data in either case, to allow numbers or weight to be converted 
into estimates of annual catch-at-age. 
50. Japan questioned why CPUE data are not available, or not used, for the surface 
fishery: 
• The SC Chair advised that actual fishing effort in the surface fishery (purse-seine 
sets) is not related in any meaningful way to SBT abundance, and so cannot 
provide a CPUE index.  Commercial spotting data are being used as a CPUE-like 
index (spotting index), but suffered from many potential biases.  For that reason, 
increasing effort is being put into the scientific aerial line transect survey, which 
9 
had improved, and is considered increasingly suitable as an index of abundance of 
age 2-4 SBT in the Great Australian Bight. 
51. Japan asked about the possibility of other longline fisheries CPUE data being used in 
the Management Procedure: 
• The SC Chair advised that while these data are available, and could potentially be 
used, the SC Chair advised that other longline CPUE indices (New Zealand, 
Taiwan, Korea) are for limited areas, few age classes, or only cover a few years.  
These other indices are therefore not very influential or useful in SBT assessments.  
Only the Japanese LL CPUE index covers most of the SBT distribution range and 
age-classes, is available for the entire history of the fishery, and so can potentially 
provide an index of SBT exploitable biomass. 
52. New Zealand asked whether the relative state of the stock is essentially unchanged 
from the 2005 assessment: 
• The SC Chair responded that under the over-catch scenarios evaluated, the stock 
is considered to be somewhat more productive, and estimates of SB2006/SB0 
(depletion) have increased from approximately 0.08 in 2005 to approximately 
0.12 under scenario-c. 
53. New Zealand sought clarification on whether all the scenarios evaluated assumed no 
over-catch in future: 
• The SC Chair responded that all of the projections made using the range of 
scenarios assumed specific future constant catch levels, and the maximum future 
catch considered in these projections was 14,925t.  In other words, it was assumed 
that all overcatch stopped in the future (paragraphs 58-59 of the SC11 Report). 
54. New Zealand asked what the TAC recommendation would be to achieve 50% 
probability of B2014>B2004 if no over-catches had been made, and reported catches 
had been correct: 
•  The SC Chair advised that if no over-catch had been made (i.e. scenario '0' in the 
SAG7 report: Attachment 6, Figure 15), a constant catch of approximately 6,500t 
would be required to give a 50% probability that B2014>B2004.  
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Report from the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
55. Taiwan presented the report of the Sixth Meeting of the Ecologically Related 
Species Working Group, which is at Attachment 15.  In reporting the outcomes of 
the meeting, Taiwan advised that: 
• The 6th ERS Working Group (ERSWG), received two strong and clear directions 
from the Extended Commission in 2005. The first was the issue of data provision 
on bycatch species and the second was the provision of management advice 
relating to ERS matters. These were the most important issues considered by the 
ERSWG and the meeting allocated most of the time available to discussions 
associated with them.  
10 
• Many matters were discussed during the meeting. However, this presentation is 
focused on these two main issues. 
• The draft recommendation in Attachment 7 contains two sections: data collection 
and data provision relating to two sources of data - logbooks and observers.  In 
the data provision section, the scale of catch and interactions by species (or 
taxonomic group) are to be provided to the Commission in 5x5 grids for longline 
and 1x1 grids for all other gears, by calendar month.  However, in instances where 
the provision of data at this spatial scale would result in breaches of domestic 
confidentiality agreements, data should be provided at the finest possible scale, 
but no larger than the level of CCSBT statistical area.  
• During discussions of working papers on seabird and shark proposals, 
considerable progress was made in identifying issues of concern.  
o Attachment 8a is a draft recommendation on reducing incidental bycatch of 
seabirds. There was general agreement on the spirit of the draft to reduce 
seabird mortality, to develop and implement National Plan of Actions, to 
collect and provide incidental catch data, to ensure implementation of 
mandatory use of tori poles in all SBT vessels below 30 degrees south as 
agreed at CCSBT 4, to encourage the use of a second tori pole or other 
additional effective measures if required, to undertake research into new 
mitigation measures and to develop a practice guide for their SBT fleets. 
However, members had differing opinions on two paragraphs of the draft and 
their views are listed together for the consideration of the CCSBT. The two 
paragraphs are Paragraphs 1 and 3 and the issues are whether to specify a target 
level of reduction of seabird mortality and whether to specify clearly the types 
of data to be collected and provided.  
o Attachment 8b is the draft recommendation on conservation and sustainable 
utilization of sharks. Members agreed on the majority of the text except the 
shaded and bracketed Paragraph 1 relating to the provision of shark data. The 
text of Paragraph 1 was based on the draft recommendation of data provision 
(Attachment 7), so there should be no objection on this paragraph when the 
draft on data provision is adopted. 
• An important development was that the ERSWG expressed a commitment to 
conclude agreements on advice to the CCSBT on reducing seabird incidental 
catch, conservation and sustainable utilisation of sharks, and data collection and 
provision for ERS at ERSWG7.  
• The ERSWG recommends to the Commission, that the ERSWG7 be convened in 
2007, instead of 2008, in order to achieve agreement on outstanding matters as 
soon as possible. 
56. Australia stated that the ERSWG failed to agree to any significant measures to 
control or mitigate catch of non-target species or the collection of data on these 
species. Further, Australia noted the overlap between the region covered by the 
CCSBT and the Areas of Competence of the IOTC and WCPFC. Both these 
11 
commissions have agreed on the implementation of measures to mitigate bycatch of 
sharks and seabirds and it is hoped that the CCSBT can adopt similar measures. 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Total Allowable Catch and its Allocation 
9.1 Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
57. The Chair requested each delegation to express its initial views on total allowable 
catch and allocation: 
• Australia responded that it would suggest a global TAC of about 11,500t.  
However, this position was entirely dependent on: 
o The TAC being fixed at this level for 3 years. 
o In these 3 years a scientific and management process must be developed that 
delivers a “bankable” assessment of the stock so that we can make sensible 
long term decisions. 
o A suitable package of monitoring, control and surveillance measures, including 
catch documentation, and vessel monitoring systems, must be implemented for 
the CCSBT. 
• Without the above measures, Australia advised it would not agree to a TAC at this 
meeting and will be seeking other avenues to address the issues outlined in its 
opening statement.  Australia will not accept a reduction in its TAC from 5,265t.  
Australia also noted New Zealand’s outstanding allocation issue.  As an outcome, 
Australia requested that New Zealand’s grievance be dealt with fairly, and 
recognised that agreements were made at CCSBT 1 which need to be honoured 
• New Zealand supported Australia’s position in general, but particularly in relation 
to the linkage between the agreement on a package on compliance measures 
before any agreement on a TAC.  New Zealand further thanked Australia for its 
support of the need to resolve issues relating to the CCSBT 1 MOU and New 
Zealand’s outstanding allocation issue. 
• New Zealand is supportive of a meaningful catch reduction based on the advice 
from the Scientific Committee.  The specific details will depend on the outcome 
of the work of the Compliance Committee, and the recommendations for future 
work of the Scientific Committee to ensure we have sound systems in place to 
assess this stock. 
• Japan responded that for the median biomass in 2014 to be equal or greater than 
the median biomass in 2004 a TAC reduction of at least 3,950t should be 
appropriate. 
• Korea expressed disappointment with the outcomes of the Stock Assessment 
Group and Scientific Committee meetings.  Korea noted that there were many 
uncertainties, but considered that a TAC recommendation should have been made 
taking into account the precautionary approach.  Korea felt that the scientists 
involved did not appear to express their individual views and that the outcomes of 
these meetings were more political than they should have been when considering 
12 
their terms of reference.  Korea proposed a 5,000t TAC reduction and advised that 
discussion should consider how to share those reductions amongst Members 
taking into account the illegal fishing that has been conducted. 
• Taiwan noted the high level of uncertainties in the status of the stocks and future 
trajectory and requested Members to take into account economic and social issues 
that would result from catch reductions.  Taiwan reserved its opinion on a TAC 
until the entire picture was clear. 
• The Philippines noted that it only had a 50t allocation and would be sorry if that 
was reduced. 
• The European Community noted that it was not targeting SBT.  It only had a very 
small bycatch associated with exploratory swordfish fishing surveys and that it 
had no intention of targeting SBT.  The European Community further noted that 
its practice was to follow scientific advice on TAC matters but that there were 
many uncertainties with respect to SBT resource status at present. 
• Indonesia noted that it was seeking a reduction in the trade restrictive 
arrangements in relation to Indonesia exports of SBT. 
58. The European Community advised that it was confident its bycatch would not 
exceed the modest quota allocated to it. 
59. The Chair remarked that the European Community accepts a 10t TAC. 
60. The Extended Commission agreed, as part of interim management measures, to 
adopt a TAC based on binding allocated catch limits for 2007 – 2009 as follows: 
 
Nominal catch (tonnes) 
Allocated catch (tonnes) 
Japan 
6065 
3000 (2007 – 2011)  
Australia 
5265 
5265 (2007 – 2009) 
New Zealand 
420 
420 (2007 – 2009) 
Korea 
1140 
1140 (2007 – 2009) 
Taiwan 
1140 
1140 (2007 – 2009) 
61. The Extended Commission agreed that each Member shall be bound to the allocated 
catch in column three above. 
62. The Extended Commission also agreed, for the purposes of paragraph 2(b) of Article 
11 of the CCSBT Convention, that the budget shall be divided in proportion to the 
nominal catch in column two above. 
63. The TAC will only be reviewed if exceptional circumstances emerge in relation to 
the stock. 
64. The Extended Commission agreed on interim catch allocations for Cooperating Non 
Members and observers for 2007, as follows: 
 
Allocated catch (tonnes) 
Indonesia 
750 
The Philippines 
45 
South Africa 
40 
European Community 
10 
13 
65. The Extended Commission noted that the new TAC will be 11,810t. 
66. The members also agreed that, taking into account the findings of the review panel 
on the Japanese Market anomalies, the allocated catch of Japan should remain fixed 
at 3,000t for the minimum period of 5 years beginning from 2007. The Extended 
Commission will review the level of this allocation in 2011, and if the stock situation 
prevailing at the time will permit and the compliance measures put in place by the 
Extended Commission and the relevant authorities of Japan are deemed sufficient to 
ensure that all unreported catches are eliminated, this level will be reviewed.  
67. Members agreed to simultaneously implement all the steps of the MOU reached at 
CCSBT 1 relating to the national allocations of Australia, New Zealand, and Japan 
from the 2010 fishing year.  Members noted that the global quota (TAC) had already 
been increased in 2001 (CCSBT 8) and that catch anomalies had prevented further 
TAC increases.  Members noted that in respect of implementing the MOU from 
CCSBT 1, the national allocation of New Zealand will be raised to either 1,000t or 
6% of the global quota, whichever is greater. 
68. In order to contribute to the recovery of SBT stock, Taiwan and Republic of Korea 
undertook to maintain their actual catch at the level below 1,000t respectively for the 
minimum of 3 years. 
69. The Extended Commission noted that the actual catch level will be below 11,530t 
for the coming 3 year period. 
70. Australia undertook to review its allocation level in future, if further deterioration of 
the SBT stock calls for such review, or if it finds such review is necessary as a result 
of its own review of SBT farming operations.   
71. In response to the request from the Extended Commission, Australia undertook to 
commence a robust and credible experiment in 2007 to ensure that the actual catch 
level of its farming operations can be properly monitored and reported to the 
Commission.  Australia agreed to submit a proposal in this regard as soon as 
practicable, with a view to inviting Members comments, if there are any. 
72. The Members agreed to continue the program to monitor the catch landings of SBT 
in Indonesia with a view to determining both a temporary allocation and a permanent 
allocation to Indonesia.  A condition of this permanent allocation will be full 
Membership and cooperation with the goals and principles of the CCSBT. 
73. The Members agreed to implement fully the resolutions and other undertakings on 
MCS measures recorded in agenda item 5.2. 
74. The Members agreed to establish new management and scientific processes that will 
allow the CCSBT to recover the SBT stock to 1980 levels within an appropriate 
timeframe. The new timeframe will be estimated by the Scientific Committee. 
75. The Members agreed to conduct a full stock assessment with the assistance of the 
CCSBT scientific advisory panel for discussion at the CCSBT meeting in 2009. 
 
9.2 Other measures 
14 
76. There were no other measures. 
 
9.3 Management Procedure 
77. There was no discussion on this agenda item. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Catch Documentation Scheme 
78. The discussion of a Catch Documentation Scheme took place under agenda item 5. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Management of Over-catch and Under-catch in National 
Allocations 
79. It was agreed that discussion of this item would be taken up in discussion under 
agenda items 5 and 9. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
International Observer Program 
80. The discussion of an International Observer Program took place under agenda item 5. 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Indonesian Catch Monitoring 
81. The meeting discussed the importance of continued monitoring of the Indonesian 
catch of SBT especially in light of the unreliability of other data series.  The program 
provides an important continuous data series on catch and landings from the port of 
Benoa.  Australia has funded the program since 1992.  The required funding for 
maintaining the program next year is $157,000.  In accordance with the agreement at 
CCSBT 12, Australia had asked the Extended Commission consider direct funding 
of the program.  Australia asked Japan to confirm that it had sought a cut to the 
CCSBT budget by 15%.  Australia agreed to continue to fund the program for 
another year. Japan advised it has sought funding to continue funding of the IOTC to 
monitor tuna landings at Cilicap and Jakarta.  The meeting appreciated effort by 
Australia and Japan.  The meeting noted that the two programs are coordinated and 
data processing from the two monitoring programs is undertaken by the IOTC. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Cooperating Non-Members 
82. The Chair advised that there were three matters for consideration, these being the 
Cooperating Non-Member status for the Philippines in 2007, acknowledgement of 
15 
South Africa’s admission as a Cooperating Non-Member and the European 
Communities application for Cooperating Non-Member status. 
83. It was agreed that the issue of national allocations to Cooperating Non-Members was 
to be discussed separately as part of agenda item 9 (total allowable catch and its 
allocation). 
Continuation of the Philippines Cooperating Non-Member status for 2007 
84. The Philippines apologised for the delay in submitting its Monthly Catch Reports 
from March to June 2006 and advised that it had no catch during this period.  It 
noted that communication problems associated with movement of its headquarters 
together with retirement of the previous CCSBT delegate had resulted in delays in 
providing information to CCSBT.  These delays would not be repeated. 
85. The Extended Commission agreed to continue the Philippines status for 2007. 
86. Taiwan requested the Philippines to provide any data or information requested by the 
Commission in a timely manner.  The Chair requested the Philippines to take note of 
this point. 
South Africa’s admission as a Cooperating Non-Member 
87. The Chair noted that South Africa has been admitted as a Cooperating Non-Member. 
88. Australia commented that for continuation of Cooperating Non-Member status in the 
future, it expected as a minimum that Cooperating Non-Members would attend 
annual CCSBT meetings, be aware of decisions and preferably attend Scientific 
Committee Meetings as well so that they can be involved in the sharing of data. 
89. In response to questions from Japan regarding the accuracy of catch history 
information for South Africa, the Executive Secretary advised the meeting of the 
discussions since CCSBT 10 on South Africa’s catch history and the TAC 
negotiations with South Africa.  The SC Chair was also asked for comment and he 
advised that South Africa has issued 20 directed swordfish fishing rights and 30 
directed tuna longlining rights.  However, he was unsure of how many of these rights 
had been activated. 
90. It was agreed that the Executive Secretary would write to South Africa asking for 
information concerning validity of its past catch data, and in particular to request that 
South Africa attends future meetings of the Commission. 
The European Community’s application for Cooperating Non-Member status 
91. The Chair advised that the application from the European Community was too late 
for formal consideration according to the rules of the Commission, but that the rules 
could be waved if desired. 
92. The Extended Commission agreed to waive the rules of the Extended Commission 
and accept the European Community’s application and they were formally 
welcomed by the Chair. 
93. The European Community thanked the Extended Commission for its flexibility.  It 
noted that its SBT fishing presence was modest and is essentially an unavoidable 
16 
bycatch of its southern ocean fishery that targets shark and swordfish.  It did not 
wish to raise the allocation issue except to say it only wanted an allocation sufficient 
to allow it to continue with its other fisheries. 
Enquiry from Belize regarding application for Cooperating Non-Member status 
94. The meeting noted that a query had been received from Belize regarding how to 
apply for Cooperating Non-Member status of the CCSBT.  The Executive Secretary 
provided the requested information, but apart from an acknowledgement from Belize 
he had not received any further correspondence.  It was also noted that Belize sought 
similar information from other RFMOs at the same time 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Relationship with CCAMLR 
95. It was agreed that the Executive Secretary would write to CCAMLR advising that 
the CCSBT did not complete consideration of the relationship between the two 
organizations and no decision has been taken. 
 
Agenda Item 16. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
96. The Executive Secretary briefly summarised issues concerning the relationship with 
non-members. 
 
16.1 Indonesia 
97. Indonesia advised that it expected to lodge an application in the near future for 
Cooperating Non-Member status with CCSBT. 
98. Taiwan noted that concerns were raised at CCSBT 11 regarding the extensive catch 
of SBT by Indonesian tuna longline vessels.  Taiwan has also paid attention to this 
problem, in particular: 
• In order to facilitate Indonesia to enhance the monitoring and management of its 
SBT fisheries, Taiwan sent a representative to meet the Director General of 
Capture Fisheries (Indonesia Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries) in June 
2006.  At this time, the matter of joint efforts in improving the management of the 
fishery was discussed and both sides agreed to hold further consultations to 
discuss the details. 
• In early June, Taiwan visited Mr Yahaya, Representative of the Indonesian 
Economic and Trade Office in Taipei to reiterate the above intention and Taiwan 
urged convening of a consultation in early September. 
99. Australia noted that it has raised the issue of the number of Taiwanese nationals 
engaged in the Indonesian fishery on the spawning grounds.  It welcomed a report on 
the activity of Taiwanese nationals and it was glad to see that the work had started. 
 
17 
16.2 European Union 
100. The relationship with the European Community was dealt with under agenda item 14 
(Cooperating Non-Members). 
 
16.3 Others 
101. The Executive Secretary noted that China has indicated that it has no current interest 
in SBT other than perhaps some minor bycatch.  The relevant correspondence with 
China is provided in paper CCSBT-EC/0610/15.  
 
Agenda Item 17. 
Action Plan 
102. It was agreed that no action was required under the Action Plan. 
 
Agenda Item 18. 
Research Mortality Allowance 
103. The research mortalities proposed by the Extended Scientific Committee were 
agreed. 
104. It was noted that additional research mortality allowance may be required for any 
experiments concerned with the Australian tuna farms agreed in other items on the 
meeting agenda. 
 
Agenda Item 19. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
105. The contacts proposed in the Secretariat’s meeting document (CCSBT-EC/0610/18) 
were agreed. 
 
Agenda Item 20. 
Program of Work for 2007 
106. The Extended Commission agreed to the workplan at Attachment 16. 
107. Members also agreed that there is an immediate need to modernise the CCSBT, with 
a view to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.  
108. Participants at both the UNFSA Review Conference and the Ministerial High Seas 
Taskforce on IUU Fishing have agreed that performance reviews of RFMOs are 
required urgently.  Further, the upcoming joint meeting of tuna RFMOs to be held in 
Kobe, Japan, is expected to promote the institutional strengthening of those 
organisations responsible for managing highly migratory fish stocks. 
109. Taking these issues into account, and noting that reviews have now been launched in 
other RFMOs, Members decided that an intersessional working group together with 
18 
the Secretariat carry out a full internal review of the CCSBT.  Each Member may 
nominate one person for the working group and the working group and the 
Secretariat provide a set of recommendations at CCSBT 14 for improving the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the Commission, consistent with world’s best practice. 
 
Agenda Item 21. 
Confidentiality of Commission Documents 
110. The meeting agreed not to restrict any of the reports from meetings in CCSBT13. 
111. In relation to the reports of Japanese Market Review, Japan advised that Mr 
Kageyama, the facilitator of the Japanese market review panel sent an e-mail on July 
24 to the Secretariat which says “…panel wishes to have the report treated as 
confidential document as body of the report contains commercially sensitive 
information…”.  Copies of the e-mail were sent to DAFF and JFA. 
112. However, it was agreed that the Secretariat would write formally to all of the authors 
of the two reports (the Japanese Market Review and the Australian Farm Review) 
asking if they wanted the release of the reports to be restricted. The Secretariat 
would advise members of the authors’ wishes intersessionally. Until then, the two 
reports would be treated as confidential. 
 
Agenda Item 22. 
Other Business 
113. There was no discussion under this agenda item.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Members of the CCSBT, Observers, Chairman Suzuki, Secretariat, new Executive 
Secretary Hermes, ladies and gentlemen. 
 
First let me thank the Fisheries Agency of Japan, the Governor and people of the 
Miyazaki Prefecture and the Mayor of Miyazaki for assisting to host this, the 13th 
meeting of the CCSBT. This is indeed a wonderful part of Japan and an attractive 
venue.  In a relaxing place such as this it would be appropriate for us to deal civilly 
with the challenging issues before this Commission. 
 
Arrangements between the three original parties to the management of SBT go back 
to the mid 1980’s with Australia, Japan and New Zealand agreeing first to voluntary 
arrangements (the Tri-lateral Agreement) to reduce the catch in this fishery to manage 
the fish stocks. Then in 1993 we agreed to establish the CCSBT as a formal 
mechanism for the management of the Southern Bluefin Tuna stock.  
 
It is fair to say that this Commission had a difficult birth and its teenage years have 
been turbulent.  The issues before this meeting will determine if the parties have the 
practical sense and willingness to allow the CCSBT to come to maturity and take its 
place as one of the better migratory stock management Commissions in the world. We 
really are now at a point of no return.  We need to become a world class and best 
practice Commission or we will fail. What follows is not easy to express but provides 
a basis on which to start this meeting. 
 
In 1998 when I first became Australia’s Southern Bluefin Tuna Commissioner it was 
at a time of major turmoil and in the midst of a dispute with Japan over the Japanese 
demand for an experimental fishing program. This dispute was very challenging and 
in all took almost 5 years to resolve, in the process causing difficulties for the 
members and for the broader relationship between our countries. They were in every 
sense hard and often difficult times. I thought however, when we finally reached 
agreement on a TAC for SBT in 2003 and having established the independent 
scientific panel we had left the old days behind. I had been enjoying the new level of 
trust and co-operation that had developed amongst the CCSBT members. I now find 
that this trust between officials is undermined by the actions of elements of the 
Japanese long-line industry. 
 
The Commission now faces another set of difficult and challenging circumstances that 
none of the members of the Commission would have wished for.  Yet it is an issue of 
such magnitude that it challenges the trust that had been established and the very 
survival of this Commission. 
 
The issue before the CCSBT at this meeting is the illegal catch in the years 1985 to 
2005 from this fishery of up to 178,000 tonnes of longline caught SBT.  From 1994 
when the CCSBT came into being the overcatch above national allocations has been 
in the order of 133,000 tonnes of fish. What is this fish worth? 178,000 tonnes of SBT 
have an estimated market value of some $6-8 billion Australian dollars, 133,000 
tonnes probably $4-5 billion dollars.  If this overcatch had not occurred we estimate 
that the fishery would be 5-6 times larger than it is at present, well on target for our 
original goal to rebuild this fishery to 1980 levels by 2020.  I suspect we would be 
congratulating ourselves on a job well done and discussing higher levels of quota for 
all. That, however, is not our lot in life. 
 
I note also in this context the paper from the external scientists estimating the state 
that the stock would have been in if the over-catch had not occurred. It actually makes 
the level of over-catch almost unforgivable. The Commission had taken the right 
decisions on catch and it has just been the actions of the Japanese long-line industry 
that has undermined the recovery of the fishery at a significant cost for all members. 
 
Chair, I have been struggling………, genuinely struggling to put the magnitude of 
this overcatch into perspective for people to be able to fully appreciate it. I find it 
almost impossible…… it is staggering conservatively 178,000 tonnes of catch $6-8 
billion dollars destroying in the short term the aspiration of members for recovery.  
You would probably find parallels in the illegal catch over time of Patagonian 
toothfish by the pirates in the southern ocean. You may find parallels overtime in 
other events and catches during the cod wars. But in Australia’s time spent fighting 
illegal fishing around the world over the last 10 years over this SBT overcatch seems 
to stand alone.  
 
As I reflect on this situation, perhaps more worrying is that the drivers that caused the 
longline industry to overcatch – “industry operating costs and lack of profitability” – 
are the same in all longline tuna fisheries.  My sense is that other cases of overcatch, 
in high valued tuna fisheries worldwide, will be uncovered in the future.  
 
When countries agree under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea 
(UNCLOS) to develop mechanisms to manage migratory fish stocks, there is an 
obligation for them to work within the established rules and to abide by the decisions 
of the Commission. We are, all of us, responsible to broader civil society for our 
actions in an international environment. Countries cannot take the obvious benefits 
from the law of the sea, such as the rights for a 200 mile exclusive economic zone and 
the freedom of the high seas, and not accept the obligations and responsibilities that 
go with these rights. These responsibilities include the requirement to properly 
regulate and account for the actions of their boats, companies and nationals that 
engage in fishing on the high seas.  
 
Three Members of the Commission are now parties to the United Nations Fish Stocks 
Agreement which only expands these obligations and should be drawn on in taking 
this Commission forward. 
 
We are, all of us, experts in hindsight and wise after an event. What has happened has 
happened. Australia has not wished for this overcatch to happen and nor have officials 
from Japan.  The sad fact is that it has occurred and we now need to come to an 
agreement on a way to deal with the amount of the overcatch, fix the problems with 
the monitoring and compliance that allowed the overcatch to occur and move forward 
towards a better future. 
 
It is pointless for us over the next 4 days to continue to labour this issue.  Rather we 
need to spend our time developing and agreeing arrangements to ensure that this can 
not and does not happen in the future. Too this end Australia has made a number of 
suggestions including catch monitoring, managing transhipment, vessel monitoring 
and observer programs to improve monitoring and compliance within the fishing 
fleets of all countries. Japan has started a process to establish a scheme that will 
hopefully lead to more effective market control and monitoring of SBT imported into 
Japan.   These are positive developments.  
 
What the members and broader civil society needs from this Commission and from all 
others Commissions that we are members of is transparency, honesty and integrity in 
our rules and processes. What we need more than anything as we move forward is for 
the Japanese long-line industry and all other long line industries to finally comply 
with the rules of this and other Commissions.  
 
What this issue has demonstrated is that none of us are immune to this type of activity 
and we need to make sure the domestic processes of all members of this Commission 
are open and transparent and subject to scrutiny.  
 
In this context Australia gives to the Commission a full commitment that we will 
work constructively with other parties to ensure that we fully meet our international 
obligations in this and in all other fisheries commissions of which we are members. 
We will continue to cooperate in good faith with all members to ensure that the 
Commissions objectives are met. You can rest easily in the knowledge that we will 
not stop pursuing this issue until we also have full compliance from all members. 
 
Chair can I suggest we make our opening statements and then we move forward and 
constructively look for ways to resolve the issues before us.

Australian CCSBT Commissioner 
CCSBT 13 Miyazaki Japan 
9 October 2006.

Opening Statement by the Republic of Korea 
 
Good morning, Distinguish Delegates, and Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
The Korean delegation appreciates the opportunity to meet and work with you at 
CCSBT13 and would like to express its gratitude to Japan for the arrangements made 
for this meeting. 
 
As you are well aware, Korea became the Member Country of the five tuna Regional 
Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs), renewing its commitment to 
sustainable conservation for tuna and tuna-like species. 
 
We fully acknowledge that all those five Commissions need to forge closer ties in 
terms of collaborative conservation and use of the highly migratory tuna species.  To 
maximize sustainable use of the resources, all Members and Non-Members should 
conform to the conservation and management measures. 
 
One of our primary management objectives must be an improved stock status.  The 
biomass has been severely depleted and there are risks for security of future MSY. 
 
The Commission should have demonstrated at least to ourselves its usefulness and 
effectiveness as an international RFMO in ensuring a sustainable and responsibly 
managed fishery.  However, the Commission has not fulfilled its responsibility in this 
sense. 
 
Korea regrets that the Commission has accomplished almost nothing in terms of the 
matter of TAC Reduction for rebuilding SBT for some years.  However, judging from 
all the information and circumstantial evidence, showing the trend of SBT stock, a 
TAC reduction is an unavoidable choice. 
 
At this meeting, we expect that the concerns about the decline in Southern Blue fin 
Tuna (SBT), the very common and invaluable asset of us and a matter continuously 
raised for the past few years, will be addressed.  
 
Especially, it is the essence of this meeting that the Commission shall study what has 
happened to us, namely, some provocative actions of our Member States, even though 
the SBT stock has been depleted far below MSY levels. Such violations which neglect, 
ignore, and undermine the Commission’s conservation and management measures for 
the Sustainable Yield could not, therefore be taken lightly and must be taken seriously 
to protect ourselves and interests. 
 
Over the years, over-fishing has been carried out.  This means that it is, what we call, 
Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing. It is a great threat to us. And, of 
course, it is needed that the Commission reconfirms the relevant members are 
responsible for it. Korea has been convinced that some swift actions against those 
states are required decisively, promptly, and definitely to secure recovery of SBT and 
to achieve MSY of SBT fishery Otherwise, it would jeopardize the international 
credibility of the Commission.   
 
Respective Representatives, and Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
We may call ourselves partners in the same boat in this regards.  At least we are 
attending this meeting with the one perspective on behalf of the respective countries.  
Korea sincerely hopes that the Member and non-member states for fishing SBT shall 
cooperate on the agenda through concerted efforts. 
 
Rest assured, Korea will make every effort to solve the above-mentioned matters in a 
sincere and responsible manner, in close collaborate with Member and non-member 
states. 
 
Korea would like to reiterate its appreciation of the staff members for successfully 
organizing this meeting. 
 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen 
 
On behalf of my delegation, I would like to extend our appreciation to Japan for 
choosing this beautiful city Miyazaki as the venue of our meeting. I would also like to 
thank Mr. Brian Macdonald for his contribution over the past 5 years leading his 
staffs to make the operation of Secretariat more efficient. Without his efforts, well 
established systematic framework in the Extended Commission as other Regional 
Fisheries Management Organizations will become illusive. 
 
My congratulation and welcomes also go to the Republic of South Africa as the new 
cooperating non-member. Besides, I have noted that European Community attends 
this annual meeting of the Extended Commission in the capacity of observer status. 
Since European Community plays an important role in various Regional Fisheries 
Management Organizations, we believe EC will make a great contribution to the 
conservation and management of SBT resources. European Community’ 
representative is welcome. 
 
At the Special Meeting held this July in Canberra, according to the independent 
review of Japanese Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) market data and Australian SBT 
farming operations, we are astonishing while finding out the fact that unreported catch 
seems tremendous. We are disappointed and hope to take an integrated monitoring 
compliance measures to rectify such misconducts in the future. As running currently 
in the Extended Commission in association with managing over-catch and under-
catch of national allocations, a payback for such over-catch shall be reviewed. 
 
Mr. Chairman, at the last Extended Commission meeting held in Taipei last year, it 
was recognized that implementation of the selected management procedure was 
linked to the decision on the initial catch reduction recommended by the Scientific 
Committee. We regret that the members did not reach consensus on the initial 
reduction made by the Scientific Committee in that meeting. We hope we can 
conclude on this key issue in this meeting for rebuilding the stock. 
 
In addition, in order to break the impasse we are facing, all members and cooperating 
non-members have to cooperate to seek how to improve monitoring of fishing 
operation and verifying catch data so as to obtain confident scientific data as the basis 
for estimating the stock status. Up to the present, various measures are proposed by 
some members but we have to set priorities to move forward. We need to think about 
how to make progress on effectiveness in the short time. For the purpose of 
sustainable utilization of the stock, we have to focus on some of the key issues 
addressed at this meeting. We look forward to working constructively with other 
delegations during the course of this week and further advancing the work of the 
CCSBT. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Thank you Mr Chair, 
Distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen – Good morning. 
 
First I want to thank our hosts – the government of Japan – for their warm welcome, 
and compliment them on this outstanding venue in the beautiful city of Miyazaki. 
 
I want to congratulate Mr Suzuki’s election as Chair of the Commission. I also want 
to thank Mr McDonald for five years of outstanding service. 
 
Mr Chair, this is a critical meeting.  The CCSBT is at a crossroads.  The decisions we 
will make together over the coming days will dictate the future of the world’s 
southern bluefin tuna fisheries. They will also determine the relevance of the CCSBT, 
and perhaps even the relevance of all RFMO’s. 
 
It is imperative, therefore, that we approach these decisions with urgency and integrity. 
This means accepting responsibility for our past actions, and making decisions about 
the future consistent with the core objective underpinning this Commission: that is, to 
ensure the conservation and optimum utilisation of the southern bluefin tuna. 
 
Accordingly, New Zealand has identified four key areas where the Commission has to 
act: 
 
First, we have to set a TAC that is in line with the best available science and the 
application of the precautionary principle.  In that regard, New Zealand notes that the 
scientific committee has recommended meaningful reductions in catch – that advice is 
unequivocal. 
 
Second, we need to adopt, as soon as possible, significant improvements to the 
Commission’s monitoring and compliance systems. I am disappointed at the poor 
progress that the Compliance Committee has made so far in this area. 
 
Third, we must commit to an internal review of the CCSBT, with the aim of 
modernising the Commission and to reflect RFMO best practice.  This is consistent 
with the recommendations from the UN Fish Stocks Agreement Review Conference.  
 
Finally, we need to address allocation issues within the Commission.  The present 
allocation system is not consistent with the allocation principles contained in the 
United Nations Fish Stock Agreement and from New Zealand’s perspective it is no 
longer defensible.  
 
On this point, I want to emphasise that New Zealand takes its international 
responsibilities very seriously. Each New Zealand Commissioner who has sat at this 
table has focussed on the Commission’s goal of rebuilding the world’s southern 
bluefin tuna fisheries to a biomass level that would support the maximum sustainable 
yield. Sometimes this has meant us taking some decisions that were not in our self 
interest. But we have done so because New Zealand will not stand for anything less 
than sound and sustainable fisheries management. 
 
I therefore want to make it very clear to all members of the Extended Commission 
how seriously outraged and aggrieved New Zealand is at the level of catch anomalies 
identified by independent panels over the last year. 
   
At the inception of CCSBT, New Zealand accepted an inequitable country allocation 
in the interests of contributing to the rebuilding of the SBT stock. This was done on 
the basis that our Coastal state rights would ultimately be recognised by way of an 
increased allocation. This was encapsulated by the CCSBT 1 MOU, which was later 
endorsed by all current members of the extended Commission at CCSBT 10.  
 
It has now been revealed that during eighteen years of sacrifice by New Zealand, 
others have been illegally fishing at astronomical levels.  
 
Our scientific analyses indicate that if it had not been for this overcatch the stock 
would now have rebuilt to 1980 or MSY levels. New Zealand believes, therefore, that 
it has have paid a high cost in terms of its coastal state rights while others have mis-
appropriated the benefits.   We therefore expect the members of this Commission to 
now act honourably, with goodwill, and consistently with their international 
obligations, and to explore ways for making right this situation.  New Zealand is not 
prepared to have its position on this issue disregarded by the CCSBT anymore. 
 
We have been wronged, we want justice, and if we don’t get it here we will take our 
case elsewhere. 
 
Mr Chair, members of the extended Commission: if we cannot address these four 
issues adequately, the international community will judge us poorly -- and I am afraid 
they would be right.  In judging us, they would also – by implication – judge every 
other RFMO. 
 
And if the international community doubts the effectiveness of RFMOs in managing 
fisheries, it will begin looking at other ways to manage them. This could mean 
complete closures to many of the world’s productive high seas fishing grounds. 
 
 We trust that the other Commission members will be approaching these issues with 
the same seriousness as New Zealand over the coming days, and we look forward to 
working closely and constructively with you to rebuild the integrity of the CCSBT. 
 
Thank you

Opening Statement by Japan 
By Jun Yamashita 
 
Thank you, Chairman 
 
Members, Cooperating Non-Members, Secretariat, ladies and gentleman; I would like 
to express my gratitude. 
 
I would like to introduce again the new SBT fisheries management system, which was 
implemented from this SBT fishing season.  
 
Until last year, we aggregated fishing operating information, such as catch, date and 
fishing area, from SBT registered fishing vessels, and we ordered these vessels to 
cease fishing in designated fishing zones when we assumed TAC (Total Allowable 
Catch) was reached.  However, last year, SBT catch by non-SBT registered fishing 
vessels was detected.  Furthermore, there was SBT catch outside the designated 
fishing zones after we ordered vessels to cease SBT fishing in the designated fishing 
zone.  As a result, we exceeded our allocation of 6,065 tons by about 1,800 tons.  
 
This incident indicated that there was a shortcoming within the old SBT management 
system.  Therefore, we initiated a drastic improvement of the management system 
immediately after the detection, and we have implemented the following new SBT 
fisheries management system from April 2006.  
 
There are three major components.  Firstly, we decided to assign SBT allocation for 
individual fishing vessel.  This allocation is free of charge and not transferable among 
different fishers.  Secondly, it is obligatory to attach a tag to each SBT caught, and the 
tag contains the call sign of a fishing vessel and a serial number.  Before fishers land 
SBT, they have to report serial numbers of these SBT to the JFA, and, at the time of 
landing at a designated port, all individual SBT is inspected by JFA officer.  Thirdly, 
possession, sale or purchase of illegally caught/landed SBT, in other words a tag-less 
SBT without justifiable reasons, is prohibited. 
 
All of these measures are ensured with ministerial order and notices under Fisheries 
Act of Japan, and there are serious penalties against offenders.  We increased number 
of JFA officers at the designated ports for inspection.  Furthermore, we deducted 
1,500 tons from this year’s allocation. 
 
These new measures together with patrol vessels, VMS, RTMP, and observer 
program, all of which have been implemented for years, make certain that SBT 
fisheries are properly managed. 
 
These measures will become more flawless if each Member agrees to implement the 
tagging program, which requires putting a tag on each captured SBT. 
 
Among a specific fishery of a Member, under estimate of SBT at time of catch is 
pointed out.  With a subsequent short growing period, it is reported that SBT are 
growing double in size.  If it is not under estimates of the catch at the time of catch, 
then this is the epoch making growth rate, which is unprecedented in aquaculture 
history.  We request the verification of the growth rate with high transparency as soon 
as possible.  After the verification is completed, it should be accepted.  However, it 
will be praised if a precautionary approach is taken now. 
 
Extremely biased and one-sided information saying that Japan had been engaged in 
massive over-catch for many years was released to the mass media. The over-catch 
claim is based on estimate with low reliability, and therefore we cannot accept 
estimates blindly.  However, based on what happened last year, we implemented the 
new SBT fisheries management system immediately to prevent recurrence as I 
explained in the beginning.  
 
The status of SBT resource is our great concern.  We have to implement 
recommendations from the Scientific Committee and also to bring meaningful 
reduction in terms of TAC. 
 
Japan is determined to contribute to this meaningful reduction as we are a responsible 
country of SBT fisheries and consumption. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the Philippines 
 
HONORABLE CHAIRMAN 
DISTINGUISHED DELEGATES 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
GOOD MORNING 
 
On behalf of the Philippine delegation, I would like express our sincere appreciation to 
the Government of Japan for the warm welcome. 
 
This is a great pleasure to attend the 13th annual meeting of CCSBT in this beautiful 
venue in the city of Miyazaki. 
 
The participation of the Philippines in the CCSBT is always an opportunity to interact 
with CCSBT member countries on concerns relating to the conservation and management 
of the southern blue fin tuna at the same time enhancing the position of the Philippines 
cooperation to the commission. 
 
It welcomes the agenda of this annual meeting and looks forward to discussing with 
CCSBT member countries, issues concerning the economic viability of Philippine vessels, 
in the light of its current national quota allocation and compliance requirements issues. 
 
The Philippines is committed in whatever little way to contribute positively, with 
whatever available option for the conservation and management of SBT stock. 
Attachment 6-1 
 
Opening Statement by the European Community 
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
It is a pleasure for the European Community to be present for the first time at the Annual 
Meeting of the Convention on the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.  
 
As you all know, the European Community is committed to RFMOs and the key role they 
play in the long term conservation and sustainable use of stocks and to the importance of 
the strengthening and modernising these organisations. The European Community is a 
member of almost all the existing RFMOs and is an observer in those to which it has not 
yet acceded.  Furthermore, we are currently active in the establishment of new RFMOs 
such as the South Pacific. 
 
We are following the important work of your organisation with interest and look forward 
to participating in this Annual meeting.  
 
As you are aware, the EC does not target Southern Bluefin Tuna in their fisheries in the 
Southern Oceans. However, some Community longline vessels have recently, while 
undertaking exploratory fisheries had some small unavoidable by-catches of Southern 
Bluefin tuna. I would like to underline that the level of by-catches of Southern Bluefin 
tuna have been extremely limited with 1.000 kg to maximum 3.400 kg per year based on 
statistics for all oceans.  
 
Therefore, and in line with the Community's constant policy of cooperation with RFMOs, 
we have forwarded a request to your Commission to accord the EC the status of 
Cooperating non-member within the CCSBT. A cooperation quota of a modest dimension 
would be desirable. 
 
 
Thank you 
 
Attachment 6-2 
 
Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Honourable Chairman,  
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen. 
 
First of all, on behalf of the Indonesian delegates, I would like to thank to the Executive 
Secretary for the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna for inviting 
us to joint the Extended Commission of the Thirteenth Annual Meeting and the Japan 
government for hosting this important meeting. 
 
Referring to the Executive Secretary letter of 5 July 2006 sent to Director of Commodity 
and Standardization, Directorate General of Multilateral on Economy, Finance and 
Development, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an active communication had been 
strengthened.  However, the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries have been 
deliberating robust intention and recently had gained support from related institutions in 
the country to lift up current Indonesian position in CCSBT, from observer to be a 
cooperating non-member.  In this regard, may I reiterate again that a formal request to the 
Commission would officially be delivered in the near future.   
 
The Indonesia willingness to cooperate with the RFMOs on the development of the tuna 
fisheries management in the region, Indonesia has been working to improve the national 
fisheries statistical data collection in collaboration with the IOTC/OFCF and 
ACIAR/CSIRO/DAFF Australia.  From the said collaboration, data of tuna caught by 
longline vessels in Indian Ocean areas can be presented with higher accuracy.  This 
current development would be benefited for RFMOs in supporting management for tuna 
like species, including SBT.  
 
Finally, on behalf of the Indonesian government, I would like to reaffirm the Indonesian 
commitments to cooperate with the Commission and also would like to take this 
opportunity to seek the Extended Commission consideration to release the current trade 
restrictive measure to the Indonesian SBT.   
 
Thank you.-

Draft Resolution on the implementation of a Catch Documentation Scheme to 
record all catches of Southern Bluefin Tuna regardless of whether the Southern 
Bluefin Tuna were traded. 
 
(for adoption at the Thirteenth Annual Meeting – 10-13 October 2006) 
 
Draft Resolution on the implementation of a Catch Documentation Scheme to 
record all catches of Southern Bluefin Tuna regardless of whether the Southern 
Bluefin Tuna were traded. 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Noting the intention of the Extended Commission to introduce an integrated package of 
monitoring, control and surveillance measures to improve compliance with the 
conservation and management measures of the Extended Commission in order to ensure 
the long-term sustainability of the stock; 
 
Recognising the need for monitoring, control and surveillance measures to apply to all 
sectors of the global SBT fishery; 
 
Noting that on 1 June 2000 the Commission implemented a Trade Information Scheme to 
collect more accurate and comprehensive data on Southern Bluefin Tuna fishing through 
monitoring trade in Southern Bluefin Tuna under the jurisdiction of the Commission; 
 
Further Noting that the Trade Information Scheme does not adequately cover landings of 
domestic production and trade of Southern Bluefin Tuna; 
 
Considering that the adoption of a comprehensive and effective Catch Documentation 
Scheme, tracking each catch of Southern Bluefin Tuna from catch to the point of first 
sale, would improve the Commission’s functioning; 
 
Agrees that: 
 
1. 
The Commission shall develop and implement a Catch Documentation Scheme to 
record all SBT caught by Members and Cooperating Non-Members regardless of 
whether the Southern Bluefin Tuna was traded, taking into account: 
• The principles of a CDS agreed at CCSBT 12. 
• The need to coordinate with other tuna RFMOs. 
• The practicality of tagging individual fish as a cornerstone of a CDS (certificate 
of origin)1. 
 
2. 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall finalise the details of the Catch 
Documentation Scheme in inter-sessional meetings before the Fourteenth Annual 
Meeting of the Commission, in order to have the Commission’s approval of the 
agreed scheme at that meeting.  The scheme shall be implemented by 1 January 
2008 or another date agreed by the Commission.   
 
3. 
The Catch Documentation Scheme shall apply to the catch, landing and trade in all 
Southern Bluefin Tuna by all Members and Cooperating Non-Members, including 
                                                 
1 As a first step the Secretariat is asked to produce a draft proposal by July 2007. 
during transhipment, import, export, re-export, and landings of domestic 
production.  
 
4. 
The Catch Documentation Scheme shall include the following elements: 
 
(i) 
The Scheme shall track the catch, landings and trade flows, including transfer, 
transhipment, import, export, re-export, and landings of domestic production, 
of all Southern Bluefin Tuna.   
(ii) 
Copies of all catch documents shall be submitted to the flag state / fishing 
entity within a reasonable time and forwarded by the flag state / fishing entity 
to the Secretariat unaltered within a reasonable time after receipt.  
(iii) 
Each shipment of Southern Bluefin Tuna imported, exported, re-exported or 
domestically landed shall be accompanied by a catch document that has been 
signed and stamped by a person officially approved by the Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member as being complete and valid. 
(iv) 
Copies of documents shall be kept by the relevant Member or Cooperating 
Non-Member with additional copies submitted to the Secretariat on a regular 
basis for collation, analysis and verification. 
(v) 
Southern Bluefin Tuna catch without completed and validated catch 
documents shall be considered as catch taken in contravention of the CCSBT 
conservation and management measures and shall not be permitted to be 
imported, exported, re-exported or landed on the domestic market. 
(vi) 
The Scheme shall include a requirement that catch documents may be 
inspected at any time by an official approved by the Member or Cooperating 
Non-Member to ascertain the validity of documents. 
(vii) 
The scheme shall include tagging and measurement of weight and length of 
individual SBT at the time of kill.  
 
5. 
This resolution shall bind all Members and Cooperating Non-Members.

Draft Resolution on the development and implementation of a Vessel Monitoring 
System 
 
(adopted at the Thirteenth Annual Meeting – 10-13 October 2006) 
 
 
Draft Resolution on the development and implementation of a Vessel Monitoring 
System 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Noting the intention of the Extended Commission to introduce an integrated package of 
monitoring, control and surveillance measures to improve compliance with the 
conservation and management measures of the Extended Commission in order to ensure 
the long-term sustainability of the stock; 
 
Recognising the need for monitoring, control and surveillance measures to apply to all 
sectors of the global Southern Bluefin Tuna fishery; 
 
Further recognising the value of an effective and fully operational satellite-based Vessel 
Monitoring System in combating illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing for Southern 
Bluefin Tuna and ensuring compliance with the Commission’s conservation and 
management measures;  
 
Aware that some Members and other regional fisheries management organizations have 
established Vessel Monitoring Systems and that the experiences of such Members and 
organizations may be useful in developing and implementing a Commission for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna Vessel Monitoring System; 
 
Agrees that: 
 
1. 
The Commission Members and Cooperating Non- Members shall develop and 
implement their satellite-linked Vessel Monitoring Systems for fishing vessels 
catching SBT and flagged to Members and Cooperating Non-Members . 
 
2. 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall finalise the details of their Vessel 
Monitoring Systems in inter-sessional meetings before the Fourteenth Annual 
Meeting of the Commission, in order to agree minimum standards at that meeting.  
These Vessel Monitoring Systems shall be implemented by 1 January 2008.   
 
3. 
The Vessel Monitoring Systems shall include the following elements: 
 
(i) 
Flag states/fishing entities shall monitor and manage their vessels equipped 
with vessel monitoring devices. 
(ii) 
Rules and conditions of use shall be developed intersessionally to protect and 
ensure the confidentiality of any data transmitted to the Secretariat.

Attachment 11 
 
Draft Resolution on Establishing a Program for Transhipment by Large-Scale 
Fishing Vessels 
 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), 
 
TAKING ACCOUNT of the need to combat illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) 
fishing activities because they undermine the effectiveness of the conservation and 
management measures already adopted by the CCSBT; 
 
EXPRESSING GRAVE CONCERN that organized tuna laundering operations have been 
conducted and a significant amount of catches by IUU fishing vessels have been 
transhipped under the names of duly licensed fishing vessels; 
 
IN VIEW THEREFORE OF THE NEED to ensure the monitoring of the transhipment 
activities by large-scale longline vessels in areas beyond national jurisdiction, including 
the control of their landings; 
 
TAKING ACCOUNT of the need to collect catch data of such large scale long-line tuna 
to improve the scientific assessments of those stocks; 
 
Agrees in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8 of the CCSBT Convention, that: 
 
SECTION 1. PROGRAM TO MONITOR TRANSHIPMENTS AT SEA 
 
1. The Commission hereby establishes a program to monitor transhipment at sea which 
applies initially to large-scale tuna longline fishing vessels (hereafter referred to as 
the “LSTLVs”) and to carrier vessels authorised to receive transhipments from these 
vessels at sea. The Commission shall at its 2010 Annual Meeting, review and, as 
appropriate, revise this Resolution. 
 
2. Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall determine whether or not to authorize 
their LSTLVs to tranship at sea. However, if the  Members and Cooperating Non-
Members authorizes the at-sea transhipment by its flag LSTLVs, such transhipment 
should be conducted in accordance with the procedures defined in Sections 2, 3 and 4, 
and annexes 1 and 2 below. 
 
SECTION 2. RECORD OF VESSELS AUTHORISED TO RECEIVE 
TRANSHIPMENTS-AT-SEA IN AREAS BEYOND NATIONAL JURISDICTION 
 
3. The Commission shall establish and maintain a CCSBT Record of Carrier Vessels 
authorized to receive SBT at sea from LSTLVs. For the purposes of this Resolution, 
carrier vessels not entered on the record are deemed not to be authorized to receive 
SBT in at-sea transhipment operations. 
 
4. Each Member and Cooperating Non-Member shall submit, electronically where 
possible, to the CCSBT Secretary by CCSBT 14 the list of the carrier vessels that are 
authorized to receive at-sea transhipments from its LSTLVs. This list shall include 
the following information: 
1) The flag of the vessel 
2) Name of vessel, register number 
3) Previous name (if any) 
4) Previous flag (if any) 
5) Previous details of deletion from other registries (if any) 
6) International radio call sign 
7) Type of vessels, length, gross tonnage (GT) and carrying capacity 
8) Name and address of owner(s) and operator(s) 
9) Time period authorised for transhipping 
 
5. Each Member and Cooperating Non-Member shall promptly notify the Executive 
Secretary, after the establishment of the initial CCSBT Record of Carrier Vessels, of 
any addition to, any deletion from and/or any modification of the CCSBT Record of 
Carrier Vessels, at any time such changes occur. 
 
6. The Executive Secretary shall maintain the CCSBT Record of Carrier Vessels and 
take measures to ensure publicity of the record and through electronic means, 
including placing it on the CCSBT website, in a manner consistent with 
confidentiality requirements notified by Members and Cooperating Non-Members for 
their vessels. 
 
7. Carrier vessels authorized for at-sea transhipment shall be required to install and 
operate a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). 
 
SECTION 3. AT-SEA TRANSHIPMENT

along with its number in the CCSBT Authorised Vessel List, in accordance with the 
format set out in Annex 2. 
 
Receiving carrier vessel: 
 
13. The master of the receiving carrier vessel shall complete and transmit the CCSBT 
transhipment declaration to the CCSBT Secretariat and the flag Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member of the LSTLV, along with its number in the CCSBT 
Record of Carrier Vessels authorized to receive transhipment at sea, within 24 hours 
of the completion of the transhipment. 
 
14. The master of the receiving carrier vessel shall, 48 hours before landing, transmit a 
CCSBT transhipment declaration, along with its number in the CCSBT Record of 
Carrier Vessels authorized to receive transhipment at sea, to the competent authorities 
of the State / Fishing Entity where the landing takes place. 
 
Regional Observer Program 
 
15. Each Member and Cooperating Non-Member shall ensure that all carrier vessels 
transhipping at sea have on board a CCSBT observer, not later than 1 January 2008, 
in accordance with the CCSBT Regional Observer Program in Annex 3. The CCSBT 
observer shall observe the compliance with this Resolution, and notably that the 
transhipped quantities are consistent with the reported catch in the CCSBT 
transhipment declaration. 
 
16. Vessels shall be prohibited from commencing or continuing at-sea transhipping at sea 
without a CCSBT regional observer on board, except in cases of ‘force majeure’ duly 
notified to the Executive Secretary.

Members of LSTLVs shall ensure that transhipments are consistent with the 
reported catch amount by each LSTLV. 
b) The Flag Member or Cooperating Non-Member of LSTLVs shall validate the 
Statistical Documents for the transhipped fish, after confirming that the 
transhipment was conducted in accordance with this Resolution. This 
confirmation shall be based on the information obtained through the CCSBT 
Regional Observer Program. 
c) Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall require that SBT caught by 
LSTLVs, when imported into the territory of a Contracting Party, be 
accompanied by statistical documents validated for the vessels on the CCSBT 
Authorised Vessel List and a copy of the CCSBT transhipment declaration. 
 
18. The Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall report to the Executive Secretary 
6 weeks prior to the Annual Meeting of the Commission:

19. All SBT landed or imported into the Members and Cooperating Non-Members either 
unprocessed or after having been processed on board and which are transhipped, shall 
be accompanied by the CCSBT transhipment declaration until the first sale has taken 
place. 
 
20. Each year, the Executive Secretary shall present a report on the implementation of 
this Resolution to the annual meeting of the Commission which shall review 
compliance with this Resolution. 
 
21. These provisions shall be applicable from 1 July 2008. 
 
22. To avoid the duplication of the same measures, ICCAT or IOTC observers on 
transhipment vessels on the CCSBT Record of Carrier Vessels may be deemed to be 
participating in the CCSBT transhipment program, provided these observers meet the 
standards established in this Resolution and the CCSBT Secretariat is informed.  The 
CCSBT Secretariat shall liaise with the ICCAT and IOTC with respect to any 
information submitted to those organizations regarding SBT.  The CCSBT Secretariat 
shall also exchange information on transhipment and observer standards with other

1. Introduction 
This report summarises catches and fishing activities in the 2003–04 and 2004–05 quota years1 of the 
Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus maccoyii; SBT) Fishery. It also provides preliminary data on the 
2005–06 surface fishery. 
 
The Australian domestic SBT catches for the 2003, 2004 and 2005 calendar years were 5827 t, 5062 t and 
5244 t, respectively. The 2003 calendar year catch is larger than the previously agreed national allocation to 
Australia of 5265 t because it represents the aggregation of catches from periods in two quota years. The 
2002–03 quota year catch was 5391 t; for the 2003–04 quota year was 5120 t; and for the 2004–05 quota 
year was 5248 t. The 2003–04 figure is under the previously agreed national allocation to Australia because 
in the 2002–03 season two quota holders caught over their allocation. This was dealt with by deducting the 
over catch from their 2003–04 allocation. In August 2005 there was a prosecution for the illegal take of 
5764 kg of SBT in the 2003–04 season. Adding the over catch of 128 t and the illegal catch of 6 t to the 
2003–04 quota year catch gives a figure of 5254 t, which is under the agreed national allocation to Australia.

1 Various time periods, such as ‘calendar years’, ‘fishing seasons’ and ‘quota years’, can be used when describing Australia’s SBT 
fishery. Unless otherwise indicated, we have used quota years in this report, but note that fishing seasons of the various fishery 
components often span quota years. The start and end dates of Australian quota years have varied and are presented in Appendix 1. 
 
2. Operational Constraints on Effort 
Regulatory Measures 
Domestic operations are managed through individual transferable quotas (ITQs) granted as Statutory Fishing 
Rights (SFRs) under the Southern Bluefin Tuna Management Plan 1995. 
 
The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) uses a risk based compliance strategy in the SBT 
purse seine and longline fisheries. This includes targeted compliance operations to check fishing vessels at 
sea, and at landing ports; a comprehensive audit trail from the time SBT are caught to the time they are 
exported, including random audits of fishing companies and export establishments; and then an annual 
review of compliance risks leading to refined strategies for the following season. 
 
Australia has continued to use a combination of area restrictions, minimum quota holdings, fishery observers, 
and mandatory Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) to reduce the incidental catch and mortality of SBT 
caught in the domestic longline fishery. A SBT habitat model incorporating archival tag and observer data 
with sea surface and sub-surface temperatures, is used to predict likely areas of high SBT abundance and 
hence the location of restricted access zones. In the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF), areas with a 
high probability of SBT interactions have been determined and are referred to as the Core Zone and Buffer 
Zone. For the 2004–05 season, access to the Core Zone during the months of May to October was subject to 
100% observer coverage, and mandatory minimum quota requirements. Access to the Buffer Zone was 
subject to 25% observer coverage, and mandatory minimum quota requirements. These requirements were 
modified for the 2005–06 season so that the level of observer coverage depended on the amount of quota 
carried, as per Table 2.

To improve compliance and management outcomes for its domestic fishery, and to better meet international 
management obligations, Australia implemented a range of amendments to its Southern Bluefin Tuna 
Management Plan 1995 on 1 December 2004. These included: 
• 
revised objectives, management measures, and performance criteria; 
• 
incorporation of the Commission's current stock-specific reference point; 
• 
the development of a by-catch action plan and strategies to reduce broader environmental impacts; 
• 
amendments to enhance the accountability of SBT Statutory Fishing Right holders against their 
allocated quota; and, 
 
• 
daily at sea reporting of SBT taken and transferred into tow cages, provisional deduction of SBT 
quota based on at sea estimates of catch, and daily VMS or manual reporting of catch and tow 
vessel locations. 
 
3. Catch and Effort 
In 2004–05, 99.3% of the Australian catch of SBT was taken by purse seine with the remainder taken by 
longline. Australian catch by gear and State for the quota years 1988–89 to 2004–05 is shown in Table 5. 
Catch by season with vessel number and search hours is shown in Table 4. The Australian catch of SBT for 
the calendar years 2004 and 2005 is mapped in Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively.

Insufficient data were available to provide an estimate of the recreational catch in 2003, 2004 and 2005. 
Discards 
During the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons, no discarding of SBT was observed or reported in logbooks 
collected in the purse seine fishery in the Great Australian Bight.  
 
In 2004, AFMA observers monitored longline operations in the ETBF during the months and areas in which 
SBT are most likely to be taken incidentally (i.e. south of 30oS from May to September). Observer data 
showed that 61% of longlined SBT were discarded during the observed operations. In contrast, the level of 
SBT discards recorded in logbooks from other vessels fishing during the same period south of 30oS was only 
10%. In response to this information the AFMA implemented tighter access controls and implemented 100% 
observer coverage for the 2005 and 2006 season in areas and at times where there is a high risk of SBT being 
caught (Core and Buffer Zones). Note that this definition is more restricted than the definition outlined here 
for when and where SBT are most likely to be taken. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Australian SBT catch in 2004 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2: Australian SBT catch in 2005 
In 2005 in the ETBF, south of 30º S and during the months of May to September (the months in which SBT 
are usually caught), 14 observers monitored 254 thousand hooks of a season total of 678 thousand, 
representing 37.5% observer coverage of longline effort. The total catch number of SBT caught while 
observers were on board was 327 of which 240 were retained, 65 were discarded (60 of which were released 
alive), 3 escaped and 19 were tagged. Note that tagged fish have not been included as discarded fish. ETBF 
logbooks for 2005 showed 36 tonnes (382 fish) of SBT were retained in the ETBF fishery and only 34 (8%) 
were discarded. 
 
Over 2005 and 2006, Bureau of Rural Sciences (BRS) observers monitored longline operations in the 
Southern and Western Tuna and Billfish Fishery (SWTBF). One SBT was landed in 2005 with twenty two 
discarded during observed operations. It should be noted that levels of effort in this fishery are very low at 
present (i.e. only 1 or 2 vessels are operating).

Overall the data available on recreational catch of SBT is limited but an initial review revealed high 
year-to-year variability in catches and the locations in which SBT were taken. For the past ten years, 
indicative estimates of annual recreational catches ranged between 3 and 85 tonnes with the highest catches 
occurring around Tasmania (Table 6). These data are indicative estimates only and are based on a range of 
different data sources.

While there are insufficient data at present to quantify the total recreational catches of SBT for 2004–05 and 
2005–06, high spatial catch variability was evident from anecdotal reports. 2004–05 was a good season in 
South Australia but poor elsewhere, especially in Tasmania where the annual southern bluefin tuna 
tournament produced very disappointing catches of SBT (i.e. no SBT were caught). In 2005–06, South 
Australia, Victoria and Tasmania experienced a good season for recreational SBT catches.

5. Annual Fleet Size and Distribution 
In 2004–05, a total of 23 commercial fishing vessels landed SBT in Australian waters. 
South Australia 
The one- to five-year-old SBT, which school from late spring to autumn in surface waters of the eastern 
Great Australian Bight, South Australia, were fished by seven purse seiners during the 2004–05 quota year, 
but various live bait, pontoon-towing and feeding vessels were also involved. Fishing commenced in early 
December 2004 and finished in mid April 2005. 
Western Australia  
Twenty three SBT were observed caught during 2005 in the SWTBF. Fish ranged in length from 167 to 182 
cm. One SBT was retained during observed longline operations and observers reported about 60% were alive 
when the longlines were retrieved. 
New South Wales 
During 2004–05, 16 domestic longliners participated at some time in the area of the fishery for older 
juveniles and adults in deeper waters off NSW. Longline fishing off NSW commenced in early June 2005 
and finished in mid October 2005. 
 
Tasmania 
There was limited fishing for SBT off Tasmania in the 2004–05 quota year. 
Queensland 
There was no fishing for SBT off Queensland in the 2004–05 quota year. 
 
6. Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
Troll catches of SBT were reported as early as the 1920s off the east coast of Australia but significant 
commercial fishing for SBT commenced in the early 1950s with the establishment of a pole-and-live-bait 
fishery off New South Wales, South Australia and, later (1970), Western Australia. Purse seine gear overtook 
pole as the predominant method and catches peaked at 21 500 t in 1982. The bulk of this early Australian 
catch of SBT was canned. Following quota reductions in 1983–84, the Western Australian pole fishery for 
very small juveniles closed down and the south-eastern fishery began to target larger juveniles to supply the 
Japanese sashimi market. Surface catches were further reduced between 1989 and 1995 when about half of 
the Australian total allowable catch (TAC) was taken by Australia–Japan joint venture longliners in the 
Australian Fishing Zone (AFZ). The joint venture ceased in late 1995. From 1992 to 1998, domestic 
longliners operating off Tasmania and New South Wales also took around 5–10% of the total Australian 
catch. 
 
In 1990–91 about 20 t of SBT tuna were transferred to fattening cages in Port Lincoln, South Australia, to 
enhance their value. Utilisation of the Australian SBT TAC in ‘farming’ operations increased from 3% of the 
TAC in 1991–92 to 98% in 1999–00 and it has remained at similar high levels since. 
 
Following declaration of the Australian Fishing Zone (AFZ) in 1979, Japanese longliners fished under a 
range of bilateral conditions, real time monitoring program and joint-venture arrangements until 1997 when 
Japanese longliners were excluded from all AFZ fishing operations following failure to reach agreement on 
global TAC within the CCSBT. Caton and Ward (1996) provide copies of annual subsidiary agreements for 
the operations of bilateral-licensed longliners in the AFZ from 1979–80 to 1994–95. 
 
7. Fisheries Monitoring 
There are a series of logbooks and associated catch records that are required by law to be completed by 
fishers and fish receivers and sent to AFMA for the purposes of monitoring, compliance and research. The 
type of form used is dependent on the type of method used to catch SBT in the fishery. All of the data 
provided from Logbooks and Catch Disposal Records must be supplied to AFMA within specified time 
periods specific to each record. 
 
Catch Disposal Records 
Catch disposal records for SBT are for recording SBT taken by fishers for the purposes other than farming 
and are signed by the fishing concession holder and the first receiver immediately after unloading the catch. 
Catch disposal records provide a means to verify logbook data. 
Australian Daily Fishing Log and Farm Transit Log 
A logbook form is required to be completed by fishers when using pelagic longlining or when fishing with 
minor line methods. The Australian Pelagic Longline Daily Fishing Log is required to be completed for 
longline fishing. In the purse seine fishery the Master of the catcher vessel (with quota assigned) is required 
to complete the Australian Purse Seine and Pole Daily Fishing Log – for farmed SBT only. A specific permit 
called the Farm Transit Log is completed by the holder of the SBT carrier boat permit or representative, and 
provided to the monitoring company which undertakes the fish count when fish are transferred from tow 
cages to farm cages. 
Farm Disposal Record 
A specific process has been designed to obtain data to allow for research and monitoring from farming 
operations. An independent company is contracted annually by AFMA to monitor the farming operations. All 
mortalities that occur during the capture and towing operations must be recorded on the appropriate form and 
must be available for inspection if requested by an AFMA officer. 
 
When SBT are transferred from tow cages to the fish farms, a video record must be carried out by the AFMA 
contracted monitoring company. The video recording is then used to undertake a count of the fish that are 
transferred into the fish farm. This count of captured fish will be multiplied by the average fish weight 
(derived from a 40 fish sample) and decremented from quota using the Farm Disposal Record. AFMA 
Compliance Officers observed at sea operations during both the 2003–04 and the 2004–05 seasons. 
Observer Program 
Observer programmes for the purse seine fishery have been in place since the 2002–03 season, and for the 
longline fishery (south-eastern part of the ETBF) since the middle of 2002.  
 
The monitoring arrangements in the SBT fishery continue to be reviewed and refined in order to improve 
monitoring and compliance. To minimise the risk of non-quota take of SBT by longliners off New South 
Wales, since 2000, access to the waters through which SBT migrate has been restricted to vessels holding 
SBT quota. 
 
 
8. Other Factors 
Import/Export Statistics 
The Trade Information Scheme that records all exported Australian fish has been implemented and refined.  
A Trade Information Scheme (TIS) form is completed by an authorised signatory from the export-registered 
establishment that is the last to handle the consignment before the product leaves Australia and validated by a 
Government officer. The form is used for both farmed and non-farmed SBT. This program provides a 
complete record of SBT exports that can be compared with the Japanese Import Statistics. 
Markets 
In 2004–05, in the order of 56 t of SBT were retained for the domestic market; approximately 82 t (processed 
weight) were exported to the USA; and the remainder of the Australian catch was exported to Japan. In July 
2005, 232kg of SBT were imported from New Zealand.  
Observer Coverage 
The purse seine observer programme for the 2005–06 Australian SBT fishing season monitored fishing and 
tow operations between 33 and 35oS and 132 and 133oE in February and March 2006. One Australian and 
one South African observer monitored 14 purse seine sets representing 9.5% of the total sets in which fish 
were taken in 2005–06. From these observations an estimated 550 tonnes of SBT were caught during 
observed sets representing 10.2% of the estimated tonnage caught for the 2005–06 season. Observers also 
monitored and recorded SBT mortalities on two towing operations. Observer coverage on purse seine vessels 
was limited to February and March hence the data is not necessarily representative of the entire fleet over the 
December to March purse seine fishing season. 
 
In 2005 in the ETBF, south of 30º S and during the months of May to September (the months in which SBT 
are usually caught), 14 observers monitored 254 thousand hooks of a season total of 678 thousand, 
representing 37.5% observer coverage of longline effort. The total catch number of SBT caught while 
observers were on board was 327 of which 240 were retained, 65 were discarded (60 of which were released 
alive), 3 escaped and 19 were tagged. Note that tagged fish have not been included as discarded fish. 
Individual retained fish ranged from 63–206 cm in length. The size distribution of the discarded ETBF 
longline catch of SBT from 2002 to 2005 is shown in Figure 1. ETBF logbooks for 2005 showed 36 tonnes 
(382 fish) of SBT were retained in the ETBF fishery and only 34 SBT (8%) were discarded. 
 
In 2005, in the SWTBF, three voyages and 47 sets out of a season total of 544 were observed for a total catch 
of 23 SBT, with a length range of 167–182 cm. Observer coverage of hook sets for the whole year was 9%. 
One SBT was retained during observed longline operations in the SWTBF and observers reported about 60% 
were alive when the longlines were retrieved. According to logbook data, 31 SBT were retained during the 
2004–05 season, with a total weight of 1195 kg.

Review of Korean SBT Fishery 
 
Ministry of Maritime Affairs & Fisheries 
Republic of Korea 
 
 
Introduction 
 
    Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) fishery is the most recently developed tuna fishery by 
Korean distant-water fishing industry.  The SBT catch made by Korean longline fleet 
reached a maximum in 1998, followed by continuous decrease until 2005. Species 
composition of the catch shows that target species accounted for 17% in 2004 and 17.5% in 
2005 of the total catch and remaining consisted of tunas, billfishes, sharks and other fish 
species.  Korean longline fleet has voluntarily deployed a tori line to reduce seabird bycatch 
by longline fishing.  
 
Review of SBT Fisheries 
 
Fleet size and distribution 
   Korean SBT fishery commenced in 1991 with a few longliners shifted from tropical 
waters where they targeted bigeye and yellowfin tuna.  Thus, in the early years of this 
fishery, SBT did not attract Korean fishing industry, but because of higher market price 
number of longliners rapidly increased to reach a maximum fleet size of 19 longliners in 
1998.  However, by the voluntary regulation of fleet size among fishing industries, annual 
fleet size for SBT fishery never exceeded 16 registered number since then and number of 
longline vessels active was 6 in 2004 and 7 in 2005. Annual number of fishing vessels for 
SBT largely depends on Japanese market price for SBT and fishing condition on the fishing 
grounds. 
 
Distribution of catch and effort 
   Fishing season of Korean SBT longline fishery usually starts in March and ends by 
November or December.  In the first half of fishing season from March to July or August, 
usually Korean longliners are fishing on the high seas of the western Indian Ocean off South 
Africa, with occasional expanded operation to the southeastern Atlantic, while in the second 
half they move to the eastern Indian Ocean off the western Australia.  This fishing pattern 
and fishing grounds have rarely been changed for the past 10 years of fishing history for 
SBT except for 1991, but in 2004 and 2005 some catches were also taken from the western 
and central fishing grounds until October.  
In 2005, 7 out of 16 registered longliners fished for SBT and made a catch of 33 mt 
(reported as processed weight), showing a decrease by about 71% from 2004.  This was 
mainly due to the shift of fishing ground and most of Korean longliners operated in the EEZ 
area of the Republic of South Africa for targeting bigeye and yellowfin tuna. 
Catch per unit effort of Korean longline fishery for SBT has shown a decreasing trend 
from a peak at 8.4 fish/1,000 hooks in 1994. However, CPUE appeared to be more or less 
stable between 2.3 and 4.1 fish/1,000 hooks in recent years. CPUE in 2004 and 2005 
decreased compared with that of 2003.  
 
Fisheries Monitoring for each fleet 
Fisheries statistics are collected and reported for a calendar year. Catch and effort data 
based on the logbooks are routinely collected through a fisheries data collection system which 
was lawful in 1977.  According to this domestic regulation, distant-water fishing vessels have 
to submit the reports of their fishing operations within 30 days (home-based) or 60 days 
(foreign-based) after completion of their operations to the National Fisheries Research and 
Development Institute (NFRDI). 
Korean government(MOMAF) initiated the fisheries observer program for distant-
water fisheries including tuna fisheries in 2002. The purpose of this program is to meet the 
requirements of relevant regional fishery bodies and therefore the mission of trained observers 
are similar to those set out in the convention of the fishery bodies. 
In 2004-2005, two observers were deployed on Korean SBT longline fishing vessel 
operating in the EEZ of South Africa and adjacent waters of Mozambique, respectively. 
Scientific observation continued for about two months starting from the mid-August 2004 and 
November 2005.  During the trip, observers monitored catch of target and by-catch species. 
More observers will be deployed this year but in the case of SBT fishery scientific observation 
is now more difficult due to limited number of actual fishing vessels.  
 
Seabird 
    
   According to fishermen, some bird species (unidentified) are usually encountered as they 
set longlines. However, no documentation on seabird bycatch has been available.  During the 
scientific observation trip, observers reported incidental catch of seabirds in spite of several 
on-board voluntary measures to avoid seabird bites such as hook-casting before dawn, tori line 
installing and defrozen baits, etc. 
 
Other Non-target Fish 
 
   Sharks data are usually collected into a “shark” category because detailed on-board 
identification was difficult to fishermen without a good guide and knowledge in biology. 
According to fishermen’s identification, it seems that blue sharks and mono sharks are 
dominant species among shark bycatch.  During the scientific observation trip, blue sharks 
and mako sharks were dominant.

Mitigation Measures to Minimise Seabird and Other Species bycatch 
Current Measures 
Mandatory Measures for Each Fleet 
   Currently there are no mandatory measures taken by Korean Government to reduce the 
incidental catch of seabird by its tuna longline fishery. However, the Ministry of Maritime 
Affairs and Fisheries (MOMAF) is developing the National Plans of Action for the reduction 
of seabird and shark bycatch from longline fisheries. It completed the NPOA-IUU fishing and 
reported to FAO in 2005. 
 
Voluntary Measures for Each Fleet  
While no mandatory measures to reduce seabird bychatch was taken by the Korean 
Government, fishermen voluntarily adopted seabird deterrent device called tori line. Based on 
fishermen’s interview, it was around 1990s when Korean longliners voluntarily began to 
deploy tori line to deter seabirds from baited hooks. Fishermen recognize from their 
experiences that deterring seabirds from contacting baits during SBT longline sets is beneficial 
not only to reduce seabird mortality but to their fishery by reducing bait and effort loss.  
In 2005 MOMAF and NFRDI published guidebooks and posters to support 
fisherman through recent information and identification key for bycatch species 
in tuna fisheries. 
 
 
Measures under Development /Testing 
 
Public Relations and Education Activities 
To avoid or reduce mortality of seabird and sea turtle by tuna longline vessels, guidebooks 
and posters for the information and release manual of these species were distributed to fishing 
boats including tuna longliners in 2005. 
 
Education 
NFRDI opens a training session for fishing vessel captains as they make a visit to Longine 
Fishing Association before they begin their fishing trip. The session largely includes reporting 
of fishing activity,  target species and implementation of international regulation. However, 
the importance of bycatch reporting is also emphasized and encouraged.

Review of Taiwan’s SBT Fishery of 2004/2005 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Taiwan has been fishing for southern bluefin tuna (SBT) since 1970s. The SBT is being 
caught partly by seasonal target fishery and partly by the albacore fishery as by-catch. 
Seasonal target fishery is conducted mainly by longliners equipped with super cold 
freezers, in two seasons, i.e. one from June to September and the other from October to 
February of the following year, in the waters around 30°S-35°S. However, no year-round 
target fishing has yet been conducted. The total annual catch in 2005 was preliminarily 
estimated to be 903 mt, a decrease of 395 mt compared to 2004. To make up the overuse 
of quota of 158 mt in 2004, a catch limit of 982 mt was set for 2005. 
 
2. OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON EFFORT 
 
Regulatory Measures 
Taiwan became a member of the Extended Commission of CCSBT in 2002, and agreed 
to limit its annual catch of SBT to 1,140 mt. Fishing vessels for seasonal target fishery 
and by-catch on SBT are differentiated and individual quota has been allocated to each of 
the vessels in the two fisheries. Every vessel is required to register with the Taiwan Tuna 
Association, whether for target or by-catch fishery, and obtain prior approval from the 
government before catching SBT. In 2005 about 98% of the annual catch limit was 
allocated to the seasonal target vessels, while the remaining 2% to the by-catch vessels. 
 
In order to collect SBT catch information in a timely manner and to control the total SBT 
catch not to exceed the catch limit, as from 1996 every vessel that catches SBT was 
required to submit weekly report on its catch of SBT by weight as well as its fishing 
location to the fisheries authorities. This system was refined in 2002 to obtain more 
accurate catch information, including the length measurement of each fish caught. In June 
2000, Taiwan began to implement a Trade Information Scheme (TIS) for the export of 
SBT, meeting the requirement of TIS as adopted by CCSBT. As from 2002, all vessels 
fishing for SBT have been required to be installed satellite-based Vessel Monitoring 
System (VMS) for transmitting the positions of vessels in timely manner to the 
monitoring center. Fishing in spawning area of SBT as suggested by Scientific 
Committee is prohibited and document of TIS will not be issued to any fish caught from 
the spawning area to protect the spawning stock. 
 
3. CATCH AND EFFORT 
 
In the 2005 fishing season, SBT catch limit was set at 982 mt, and the actual catch was 
903 mt caught by 65 active vessels, including seasonal target and by-catch fishery. About 
94% of the Taiwanese SBT catch was caught in the southern and central Indian Ocean, 
and remaining 6% in the southwestern Indian Ocean extending to the eastern boundary of 
the Atlantic Ocean. 
 
4. HISTORICAL CATCH AND EFFORT 
 
 
In the early 1980s, the annual catch of SBT was relatively small, with a catch of less than 
250 mt. Following the expansion of tuna long-line fleet and exploration of fishing 
grounds, there has been a prominent increase in the annual catches. Between 1989 and 
1992, a significant increase in the annual catch of SBT was observed, with a record catch 
of exceeding 1,100 mt, 1/4 of which was from drift net fishery. Following the prohibition 
of drift-net fishery on the high seas in 1993 in compliance with the United Nations 
General Assembly Resolution 46/215 calling for global moratorium on all large-scale 
pelagic drift-net fishing on the high seas of the world’s oceans and seas by 31 December 
1992, the annual catch of SBT decreased to a stable level, fluctuating between 800 and 
1,600 mt during the last decade (Table 1).  
 
5. ANNUAL FLEET SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION 
 
In 2005, there were 65 longline vessels fishing for SBT, of which most vessels operated 
in the Indian Ocean. Their fishing grounds were mainly in the waters of 20°S - 40°S, 
seasonally distributed in the southern and central Indian Ocean from June to September, 
and in the southwestern Indian Ocean extending to the eastern boundary of the Atlantic 
Ocean from October to February of the following year. 
 
6. HISTORICAL FLEET SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION 
 
Following the prohibition of drift-net fishing in 1993, SBT was caught only by longline 
fishery in the three oceans, but mainly in the Indian Ocean. According to the weekly 
reports from the fishing vessels and trader’s information, during 1998-2002 landings of 
SBT were carried out by about 140 Taiwanese deep-sea longliners every year, and most 
of them operated in the Indian Ocean. 
 
7. FISHERIES MONITORING 
 
Intensive efforts have been continuously exerted for better understanding and monitoring 
the fishery through the following measures: 
 
1. Weekly report for SBT catch is required for submission to the Fisheries Agency 
through Taiwan Tuna Association. As from 2002, provision of such information as 
daily catch, daily fishing location and daily discards is required in the weekly report 
when applying for SBT statistical document. 
2. As from April 2002, vessels catching SBT are required to install VMS in order to 
monitor the positions of the vessels. 
3. An experimental scientific observer program on SBT fisheries was launched in 2002. 
The observer coverage in 2005 was 11.3% by catch in number. 
4. TIS program has been implemented to collect updated and detailed catch information. 
In applying for TIS document, the applicant is required to submit the transshipment 
document issued by the cargo carriers. After unloading of the catch in Japan, the 
applicant is required to submit to Fisheries Agency the report issued by the Japanese 
Customs for further verification of catch statistics. 
 
 
 
8. OTHER FACTORS 
 
Markets 
In 2005, most of SBT caught by Taiwanese vessels were exported to Japan for sashimi 
market. Domestic consumption was 10.5 mt.

On May 5, 2006, Fisheries Agency has promulgated the National Plan of Action for 
Reducing the Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fsheries (NPOA-Seabirds) and 
simultaneously implemented regulations on the requirement of installation of tori lines on 
longline vessels operating in areas south of 28°S.

Review of New Zealand SBT Fisheries 
 
 
 
1.  Introduction 
Since the start of New Zealand’s domestic southern bluefin tuna (SBT) fishery, handline, trolling 
and longline have been used to target SBT in the EEZ. In recent years nearly all of the SBT catch 
has been by surface longline with occasional small catches by trolling and a small bycatch in the 
mid-water trawl fishery for hoki. The domestic fishery is composed of a wide range of vessel 
types including many small owner-operated boats and a few large low temperature longliners 
purchased overseas. Two large low temperature Japanese operated distant water longliners were 
chartered by a New Zealand company in 2005. Both the chartered vessels and the New Zealand 
owner-operated vessels fished competitively against New Zealand’s SBT catch allocation until 
2004. 
 
New Zealand’s fishing year starts 1 October and finishes 30 September of the following year. 
SBT is seasonally present from March/April to August/September. Fishing takes place in two 
areas, off the east coast of the North Island north of 42 S and off the west coast of the South 
Island south of 42 S. Longlining off the west coast of the South Island is almost entirely targeted 
at SBT, yielding higher catch rates of SBT than off the east coast of the North Island. 
 
SBT was introduced into the Quota Management System (QMS) effective 1 October 2004 with a 
Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) of 413 t, the remainder of New Zealand’s TAC of 
420 t being allocated to recreational and customary fishers, and other sources of mortality. The 
introduction to the QMS has seen a change from the “Olympic” race for fish seen in previous 
years. This introduction has also been associated with a consolidation of the SBT longline fleet.  
 
The most recent fishing season (2004/05) resulted in the lowest NZ catch in 10 years (264 t). This 
is attributed to two main factors: the absence of new recruitment into the NZ longline fishery 
leading to decreased vulnerable biomass and the decline in longline effort from the domestic and 
charter fleets. 
 
2.  Operational Constraints on Effort 
Voluntary measures 
Since 1994 the New Zealand fishing industry has implemented voluntary measures with respect to 
longline fishing that are detailed in a “Code of Practice”. Specific measures include gear 
specifications, environmental standards, operational practices and closed areas. The intent of the 
measures is to minimize: 
• 
bycatch (eg of seabirds and marine mammals); 
• 
catch of SBT smaller than 20 kg; 
• 
impacts on other domestic tuna fisheries, and 
• 
gear conflict among SBT longline vessels. 
 
Other voluntary measures that are used but not part of the “Code of Practice” include catch limits 
by area, changing areas when bird bycatch reaches a specific level, using multiple “tori” lines and 
longer lines than specified in regulations, night-setting, and the use of pneumatic “bird-scaring” 
cannons. 
 
 
Regulatory measures 
New Zealand continues to impose the previously agreed national catch limit of 420 t (whole 
weight) but now applies this limit to all known fishing mortality in New Zealand fisheries. Prior 
to the 2004/05 fishing season, this catch limit was a competitive limit among all license holders. 
Regulations specified the annual catch limit and made it an offence to take SBT once the catch 
limit had been reached. The catch limit applied within and outside New Zealand fisheries waters 
for the “fishing year” which extends from 1 October to 30 September. In the few years when the 
catch limit was exceeded, it was reduced in the following year by an equivalent amount. 
 
Until midway through the 2000/01 fishing season the SBT quota applied to the catch of both SBT 
(Thunnus maccoyii) and Pacific bluefin tunas (formerly Thunnus thynnus, now recognized as 
Thunnus orientalis). The quota restriction on Pacific bluefin tuna was removed late in the 2000/01 
SBT season when Pacific bluefin tuna was identified as a separate species and it was 
demonstrated that Pacific bluefin could be readily distinguished from SBT in catches based on 
morphological characteristics and DNA analysis. SBT landings reported prior to June 2001 
distinguished between northern and southern bluefin despite the fact the catches of both were 
counted against the SBT quota. Catches reported as northern bluefin were most likely Pacific 
bluefin. The quota restriction on northern bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) was removed in 2002. 
 
SBT was introduced into the New Zealand QMS effective 1 October 2004. There have been a 
number of improvements in the management of New Zealand’s SBT fishery as a result of this 
move to QMS management. Three forms of catch reporting are required (catch, effort and 
landing, catch against quota and reports by receivers of fish) to improve the monitoring of 
catches.  Significant financial penalties apply to fishers who do not cover catch of SBT with quota 
thereby limiting the potential for over catch. Further, a rationalisation of fishing effort has 
occurred in conjunction with an extension of the fishing season to focus on periods when SBT are 
in the best possible condition for capture.  
 
Pacific bluefin tuna were also introduced into the QMS on 1 October 2004 with a total allowable 
commercial catch of 116 t. 
 
3.  Historical Catch and Effort 
The New Zealand SBT fishery was initially a handline and troll fishery. With the advent of 
domestic longline fishing however (starting in 1990), longline effort has almost completely 
replaced fishing effort by trolling and handline. Small amounts of SBT continue to be caught by 
trolling, and there is a small SBT bycatch in the mid-water trawl fishery. Total SBT catches are 
summarised by calendar year and fishing year (1 October to 30 September) in Table 1.  
 
Effort for the charter fleet by calendar year and region are provided in Figure 1. Most effort 
occurs off the west coast of the South Island. Over the period 2001-2004 there has been no 
targeting of SBT (and no catches of SBT) off the east coast North Island fishing grounds. In 2005, 
the two charter vessels did fish the later part of the season off the east coast of the North Island 
and experienced higher catch rates than they had off the west coast of the South Island. Longline 
effort for the domestic fleet by calendar year and region are provided in Figure 2. While effort 
increased dramatically in both regions from 1995 to 2003, it has decreased since then, particularly 
off the west coast of the South Island. 
 
Nominal CPUE by fleet across all regions is provided in Figure 3. Charter CPUE averaged around 
3 SBT per 1000 hooks over 1997-2002. Associated with a lack of new recruitment, CPUE 
declined dramatically in 2003 and has stayed at these historically low levels in 2004 and 2005. A 
small increase in CPUE has occurred in 2005, this is attributed to the increased effort on the east 
coast North Island fishing grounds. The domestic CPUE has followed a similar pattern over time 
to the charter CPUE, although it is traditionally not as high. 
 
 
4.  Annual Fleet Size and Distribution 
The charter fleet primarily operates off the west coast of the South Island south of 42º S while 
smaller domestic owned and operated vessels primarily operate off the east coast of the North 
Island north of 42º S. SBT also comprises a bycatch in the bigeye target fishery in the Bay of 
Plenty. The fishing season for SBT is essentially the same for both areas and begins in 
March/April and generally finishes in July. 
 
The spatial distribution of fishing effort and SBT catches from the charter fleet are provided in 
Figures 4 and 5. Most of the charter catch and effort occurs off the west coast of the South Island, 
though there was some effort off the east coast of the North Island in 2005 due to the low catch 
rates experienced off the west coast. 
 
The spatial distribution of fishing effort and SBT catches from the domestic fleet are also 
provided in Figures 4 and 5. While most target effort occurs off the east coast of the North Island, 
a substantial domestic fishery has previously operated off the west coast of the South Island– 
mostly due to one large domestic vessel. Historically most of the east coast effort has been south 
of East Cape, but after the introduction of SBT to the QMS in 2004, the effort was more 
distributed around the East Cape region and occurred slightly later (a month or so).  
 
There is also a substantial domestic fishery that operates outside the SBT season. The effort in 
this fishery is more northern in its distribution and has low SBT bycatch. The distribution of 
catches is similar to that of target effort, though proportionally more catch (compared to effort) 
was taken in the west coast South Island fishery compared to the east coast North Island fishery 
prior to 2005. 
 
The number of vessels catching SBT peaked in 2002 and has since declined to only 58 vessels in 
2005. We expect that it will have declined even further in 2006 (Table 2). In 2005 only two 
charter vessels fished for SBT in New Zealand fisheries waters, which is less than recent years. 
 
5.  Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
The New Zealand SBT fishery began off the west coast of the South Island as a winter small boat 
handline and troll fishery in the early 1980s. Most fishing by these vessels was in July and 
August. Since 1990, however, these methods have comprised only a minor component of the 
fishery as the SBT quota, when fished competitively, has generally been caught by longline 
vessels by the time the handline fishery started. During the 1980s to mid-1990s most longlining 
was conducted by foreign licensed longliners from Japan. However, declining catch rates, 
shortened seasons of availability and reports of increased operating costs in the EEZ resulted in 
the foreign licensed fleet ceasing operations in 1995. Domestic longlining began in 1991 and 
steadily increased to over 150 vessels in 2002 before declining to the current low of 58 vessels.  
 
6. Fisheries Monitoring 
Observer coverage 
New Zealand has a Scientific Observer Programme that covers both domestic and charter longline 
vessels. All trips on charter vessels are covered by at least one observer, while the target coverage 
level for the domestic fleet is 10% of the effort to reflect 10% of the catch.   
 
In 2004, 12 observers were briefed and deployed (4 charter vessel and 10 domestic vessel 
deployments); in 2005, 10 observers were deployed (2 charter vessel and 9 domestic vessel 
deployments). Coverage is measured in two ways, proportion of catch (in numbers of fish) 
observed and proportion of hooks observed. In terms of catches, over 98% of the catch was 
observed (and measured) in the charter fleet in 2004 and 2005. For the domestic fleet, 15% of the 
catch was observed in 2004, but only 9% in 2005. In terms of effort, over 90% of hooks were 
 
observed on the charter vessels. For the domestic fleet 15% of the effort was observed in 2004 
and 12% in 2005. 
 
RTMP coverage 
Prior to the management of SBT in the QMS, MFish operated an in-season catch monitoring 
system for SBT. This system required that on-shore processing companies and freezer vessels 
(including all of the chartered fleet) report their catch by e-mail or fax during the season to MFish. 
Weekly reporting was required once 25% of the catch allocation was reached and daily reporting 
required when 50% of the catch allocation had been reached. Reports were collated and analysed 
by MFish with the season being closed as close as possible to reaching our national allocation. All 
SBT permit holders were then notified that the season was closed and that it would be an offence 
to take SBT for the remainder of the fishing year.  
 
From 1 October 2004 the catch monitoring and catch balancing systems in place for all other NZ 
quota species applied to SBT. All fishers are required to furnish monthly returns of catch and 
these are then matched to individual holdings of quota entitlement.  Financial penalties apply to 
fishers (on a monthly basis) who catch SBT other than under the authority of quota. Fishers have 
the opportunity to reconcile their catch and quota entitlements up until the end of the fishing year 
and if they do not do so the financial penalties increase. The total fishery catches are assessed 
annually and any adjustment will be made to future years to balance the catch from the fishery 
and the NZ national allocation as required. 
 
Biological information 
Observers from the MFish Scientific Observer Programme are responsible for collecting 
biological data on SBT and bycatch data for catch characterisation. Length, weight (both 
processed and whole weights) and sex are recorded regularly for SBT and all major fish bycatch 
species. 
 
Observers onboard the charter vessels also collect otoliths from as many SBT caught as possible. 
Due to the smaller size of the domestic vessels and the different processing practices, it is not 
feasible to collect otoliths from the domestic fleet at this time. In 2004, 1153 otoliths were 
collected from SBT, but only 429 were collected in 2005. The lower number is because only two 
charter vessels fished in 2005 compared to 2004. A sub sample of the otoliths from 2004 has 
already been aged while those collected in 2005 are currently archived and will be aged later in 
the year. 
 
7. Other Factors 
Import/export statistics 
Statistics on the export of SBT are compiled by Customs and summarized by the Department of 
Statistics. Export statistics are further summarized by the New Zealand Seafood Industry Council 
and maintained as a database for economic evaluations of New Zealand fisheries. 
Markets 
The only market for SBT caught in the EEZ is the Japanese sashimi market and domestic 
consumption is negligible. 
Mitigation 
New Zealand regulations specify that all tuna longline vessels shall use seabird-scaring devices 
(“tori-lines”). The minimum standard for “tori lines” is the same as initially specified by 
CCAMLR. The domestic fishing industry has a voluntary code of practice advocating night 
setting for all tuna longlining and for the large tuna longline vessels a limit on total incidental 
mortality of “at risk” seabirds has been set. New Zealand is currently implementing an approved 
National Plan of Action for Seabirds in response to the FAO International Plan of Action for 
Seabirds. 
 
Recreational and Customary Catches of SBT 
Recreational fishing for SBT in New Zealand waters is limited. There are records of recreational 
catch from both the North and South Islands. There are no estimates of SBT catches by Maori 
non-commercial fishing. However, a proportion of New Zealand’s national allocation is provided 
as an allowance to cover both recreational and customary catches. 
 
Resolution on IUU fishing and establishment of CCSBT Vessel record 
New Zealand provides a list of authorised vessels to the CCSBT Secretariat and has put in place 
routine systems to update the record as required.  The list includes all New Zealand flagged and 
registered fishing vessels all of which are technically authorised to fish for SBT in New Zealand 
fisheries waters.  Any catch of SBT is recorded and monitored by routine systems established as 
part of the New Zealand Quota Management System and New Zealand has no information to 
suggest that any of its registered fishing vessels have an involvement in IUU fishing.  Procedures 
have been put in place to ensure that foreign owned vessels fishing under charter to New Zealand 
companies may only fish for SBT if they are from a member state of the Extended CCSBT.  
Individual assessments of the compliance history of foreign owned vessels are required prior to 
the approval of their registration as New Zealand fishing vessels.

Review of Japanese SBT Fisheries in the 2005 Fishing Season 
 
1.  Introduction 
In the 2005 fishing season, the total catch of SBT by Japanese tuna vessels was 7,855 MT, 
and this resulted in exceeding our national allocation by 1,790 MT.  We considered this 
sincerely, and we have established a new management system to prevent over catch any 
more in the future.  The new management system introduced an individual SBT quota 
system for individual fishing vessels. It includes a tagging system that requires Japanese 
fishermen to tag each individual SBT caught.  It also requires Japanese fishermen to land 
their SBT only at eight designated ports, and all SBT landings are inspected by 
governmental-official inspectors from the Fisheries Agency. This system was 
implemented from 1 April 2006 (see Appendix 3). 
For the 2006 fishing season, we set a voluntary catch limit at 4,523 MT, which is 1,542 
MT less than 6,065 MT. 
 
2. Operational Constrains on Effort 
In the 2005 fishing season, the Japanese fishing industry has voluntary set starting days 
for three sub-fishing areas (high seas area off Tasmania/Sydney, off Cape Town and in 
Southern Indian Ocean) and limited the total number of vessels for each sub-fishing area. 
Furthermore, to monitor Japanese tuna vessels, GOJ dispatched its fishing patrol vessels 
for the three sub-fishing areas before and after the areas were closed. 
 
3. Catch and Effort 
The fishing operations for the three sub-fishing grounds on high seas were closed on 31 
July of 2005 with the catch of 879 MT by 45 vessels off Tasmania/Sydney, closed on 27 
August with the catch of 3,687 MT by 119 vessels off Cape Town and closed on 13 
December of 2005 with the catch of 2,603 MT by 58 vessels in Southern Indian Ocean, 
respectively.  
 
No discards by Japanese tuna vessels were reported. No SBT catch by recreational fishing 
was reported. All SBT caught by Japanese tuna vessels were presumed to be consumed 
domestically. 
   
4. Historical Catch and Effort 
(1) In the 2000 fishing season, GOJ set the voluntary catch limit as 4,578MT, 1,487MT less 
than 6,065MT, which was the national allocation to Japan agreed in 1997. However, 
 
 
since the provisional measures prescribed by ITLOS were revoked in August 2000, the 
voluntary catch limit was changed to 6,065MT in September 2000. The actual catch in 
the 2000 season was 6,027MT. 
(2) In the 2001 fishing season, fishing operations were started with a tentative catch limit of 
6,065MT, and GOJ set the voluntary catch limit of 6,421MT after the consultation with 
the relevant Members. The actual catch in the 2001 season was 6,647MT. 
(3) In the 2002 fishing season, fishing operations were started with a tentative catch limit of 
6,065MT, and the actual catch was 6,192MT. 
(4) In the 2003 fishing season, GOJ set the voluntary catch limit as 5,839 MT, which were 
subtracted 226 MT from 6,065MT, and the actual catch was 5,770 MT. 
(5) In the 2004 fishing season, GOJ set the voluntary catch limit as 6,007 MT, which were 
subtracted 127 MT from 6,065 MT and added 69 MT, and the actual catch was 5,982 
MT. 
  
5. Annual Fleet Size and Distribution 
The number of fishing vessels selected for targeting SBT in the 2005 fishing season was 
168.  The number of vessels on the high seas off Tasmania/Sydney was 45, the number of 
vessels on the high seas off Cape Town was 119, and the number of vessels in Southern 
Indian Ocean was 58 respectively. 
 
6. Historical Fleet Size and Distribution 
(1) In the 1999 fishing season, 227 fishing vessels (30 vessels less than the 1998 fishing 
seasons) operated, since Japan cut the number of far-seas tuna longliners following the 
Plan of Action agreed by FAO. 
(2) In the 2000 fishing season, the number of vessels for SBT was reduced to 172 in 
accordance with the reduction of the catch limit based on the provisional measures 
prescribed by ITLOS. However, since the provisional measures were revoked, 27 vessels 
were added to the original, and, consequently 199 vessels operated for SBT based on the 
increase of the catch limit in September. 
(3) In the 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 fishing season, the number of vessels for SBT was 
227, 224, 221 and 222 respectively. 
 
7. Fisheries Monitoring 
(1) GOJ issued a notification to the industry that every vessel targeting SBT must submit 
catch and effort report to GOJ every 10 days for the management of the catch limit. 
(2) GOJ took necessary measures to control and monitor the fishery, which include 
dispatching enforcement vessels to the fishing areas, dispatching scientific observers 
onboard randomly selected from SBT operating vessels, and requesting to install VMS 
for all the SBT targeting vessels and to report theirs positions to GOJ on daily basis. 
 
 
(3) Three of the enforcement vessels were allocated to the SBT fishing grounds. 
(4) 16 scientific observers were dispatched.  Observer coverage of Japanese SBT tuna 
vessels were: 9.9% in the number of vessels, 4.9 % in the number of hooks used and 
4.0% in the number of SBT caught.  The total cost of these observers was US$395,000. 
 
8. Others Factors 
 Import/Export Statistics 
The amount of imported SBT in 2005 was 9,774 MT (product weight), less than 1,599 MT 
compared with the year of 2004. Most of SBT imported to Japan was from CCSBT 
members (1: Australia, 2: Taiwan, 3: New Zealand, 4: Republic of Korea, 5: Philippine, 6: 
Indonesia). In particular, SBT imported from Australia was 8,740 MT, which accounted for 
89.4% of the total SBT imported to Japan.

Appendix 3   
 
Japanese New SBT Fishery Regulation 
 
The followings are outline of our new regulation which executed from 1 April 2006. 
 
� 
The new regulation introduced an individual SBT quota system for individual fishing 
vessel. 142 vessels have been allocated individual quota for 2006 fishing season. 
� 
It includes a tagging system that requires Japanese fishermen to tag each individual 
SBT caught , and the tag must have a serial number and fishing vessel’s call sign.  
� 
It also requires Japanese fishermen to land their SBT at eight designated ports only, 
and all SBT landings will be inspected by governmental-official inspectors from the 
Fisheries Agency. 
� 
In the new regulation, not only the fishermen, but also companies (i.e. buyers and 
sellers) that knowingly purchase or process illegally caught and landed SBT will be 
considered to have committed a criminal offence and will be subject to penalties.  
The penalties could be up-to 2-years imprisonment and/or up-to five hundred 
thousand yen fine. 
� 
In case of serious offenses, the concerned fishermen will be deprived all SBT quota 
for over the next five years.

Issues of Concern Related to Catch 
Characterization
•
Scientific and management implications of possible past over-
catches brought to light by the market and farm anomaly reports 
far outweigh any other catch characterization concerns.
•
The suggested magnitude of past over-catches jeopardizes many 
of our key indicators, undermines the basis upon which the SBT 
Operating model is designed and conditioned, and will require 
the proposed SBT MP to be re-evaluated.
•
Efforts must be made to reduce uncertainties regarding the 
magnitude and source of any past over-catches, and to provide 
reasonable estimates of past catch and CPUE trends with which 
to condition the Operating Model.
•
It is particularly important to ensure that accurate catch data 
and CPUE indices are obtained from the main SBT fishery sectors 
in future, for use as fisheries indicators, and to provide reliable 
indices of abundance for possible future use in an MP.

Recruitment Indicators
•Aerial Surveys: The aerial spotting survey and commercial spotting 
index are both consistent with a reduction in average recruitment 
below 1994-1998 levels.
•Longline CPUE*: Japanese nominal LL CPUE shows poor 2000 and 
2001 year classes, but with an increase in juveniles after the 2002 
year class.
•Size Frequency:  Size distribution in the NZ LL fishery and the 
Japanese LL fishery* continue to indicate poor 2000 and 2001 
recruitments.
•Tagging Data: High mortality rate estimates for age 3 and 4 from 
recent SRP tagging are consistent with low recruitments in these
years.
In summary, recruitment indicators continue to support previous 
evidence for poor recruitment in the 2000 and 2001 year class, and 
ongoing recruitment below the 1994-1998 levels.

Recruitment Indicators
Spawning Biomass Indicators
•Longline Catch Rates*: Reported catch rates of fish aged 12 and older 
in the Japanese LL continue to indicate a drop in spawning stock
biomass in about 1995, but this is potentially impacted by catch
anomalies.  Since the Japanese LL CPUE is the primary indicator of 
stock abundance the potential anomalies make the spawning stock 
status less certain than last year.
•Indonesian Catches: Increase in tonnage of Indonesian catch as well 
as the increase in proportion of SBT in the Indonesian catch was
associated with a shift in the behaviour of the Indonesian fleet to 
target SBT south of the spawning ground.  This change in behaviour 
complicates the interpretation of the age and size structure of 
catches from the spawning stock

Nominal CPUE of Japanese LL SBT catches by

6-7, 8-11 (since 2002) and 12+ (since 1994)*.
Following a sharp decline over the period 
2001/02 – 2003/04, Indonesian SBT catch  
and proportion of age 8-16 fish have 
increased.  This is partially due to changes in 
fishing area and targeting.
Spawning Biomass Indicators
Exploitable Biomass Indicators
•Longline CPUE*: Reported Japanese LL CPUE for all ages combined 
suggests that the exploitable biomass for these gears has remained 
fairly constant during the past 10 years, though this level is low 
compared to historical values.
•Reported CPUE indicates increases in the CPUE of ages 8-11 since 
about 1992, but a slight decline in 2003 and 2004, with a slight
increase in 2005.
•Reported CPUE of fish aged 4-7 has increased since the mid 1980s but 
has been declining in recent years.
Confidence in this indicator has diminished considerably due to the 
uncertainty associated with catch anomalies.

2006 ‘Scenario Modelling’ Approach
• There is high uncertainty regarding the plausibility of various 
alternate past catch scenarios, and the Commission provided no 
guidance on the source of past over-catches, or the impact on CPUE.
• Given this uncertainty, the SAG could not conduct a formal 
assessment in 2006.  Rather, a range of alternate ‘scenarios’ was 
evaluated, using the Operating Model under different assumptions
about past catches and CPUE.
• Advice requested by the Commission potentially represented over 
100 scenarios, once combinations and technical interpretations were 
considered.  These could not all be evaluated in the available time.

Conclusions Regarding Stock Status
• Results of scenario evaluations are generally consistent with the 
2005 assessment, and indicate that the SBT spawning biomass is at 
a low fraction of its original biomass, well below the 1980 level, 
and below the level that could produce MSY.
• All scenarios show median spawning biomass levels in 2006 
(110,000t -170,000t) well above 2005 median biomass estimate 
(50,000t) as a result of the incorporation of catch anomalies.
• However, all scenarios still show substantial depletion, with median 
B2006/B0 levels between 10% and 13%.
Conclusions Regarding Stock Status
• Continuation of catches in excess of 14,925t is likely to result in 
continuing decline of spawning biomass.
• A catch level of 14,925t does not lead to longer term rebuilding, or 
to meeting an objective of a 50% probability of B2014>B2004 for any of 
the scenarios, and will likely result in continuing declines.
• The estimated catch levels that will result in a short term target of 
a 50% probability of B2014>B2004, lie in a relatively narrow range from 
~9,900t to ~12,100t.
• However, even under a constant catch of 9,925t, projections 
indicate a 40% chance of further spawning stock reductions by 2014, 
without some other feedback mechanism to cut catches further 
should low recruitment occur.
Management Advice
• The discovery of large past catch anomalies led to a re-
consideration of the advice provided last year.  The 2006 
management advice is based on results across the range of 
alternate past catch scenarios evaluated.
• The scenarios evaluated were reasonably consistent with each 
other in terms of current stock status, recruitment trends, and 
projected stock biomass under specific constant catch levels and, 
under the current circumstances, represent the basis for best 
available scientific advice.
• The scenarios show that, in order to reduce the short term risk 
(to 2014) of further declines in stock size, a meaningful reduction 
in catch below 14,925t is required, in addition to assurance that 
all unreported catches are eliminated.
2006 Basis for Management Advice
7
• Constant catches over the range examined (4,925t - 14,925t) still 
have a high risk of further spawning stock declines.
• Given the current low stock status and recent low recruitments, 
there is a risk that further stock decline could jeopardize recovery 
prospects.
• In the absence of reliable data and a rapid feedback system (such 
as an MP), the TAC would therefore need to be much lower to 
ensure a reasonable probability of rebuilding under future constant 
catch levels.
• The larger the level of immediate catch reductions, the lower the 
risk of further spawning stock declines.
2006 Basis for Management Advice
2006 Management Recommendations
To ensure a high probability of sustainability and rebuilding of the SBT 
spawning stock, three steps are required:
1. An immediate reduction in total catches to below 14,925t to 
decrease the probability of further stock declines.  
2. Immediate action to restore confidence in estimates of total catch 
and CPUE series.  Monitoring of recruitment and of the Indonesian 
fishery must continue, and where possible, be improved.   
3. An interim management procedure needs to be adopted within the 
next 3-5 years, with a full management procedure thereafter 
designed to ensure a high probability of stock rebuilding.
(If recruitment indicators in the next few years revert to the low 
levels of 2000 and 2001, further substantial catch reductions will 
be required.)

Management Procedure

Management Procedure Implications
• The success of management to achieve rebuilding of the spawning 
stock depends on the ability to monitor trends in abundance, and to 
reduce future catches if the stock continues to decline.  This is the 
role of an MP.
• The design of the SBT MP proposed in 2005 was based on past catch 
and effort data reported up to then, and used LL1 CPUE as the index 
upon which the MP decision rule was based.
• Past overcatch implications in the Market and Farm Anomaly reports 
will now require this MP to be completely re-designed and re-
evaluated.  This process could take ~5 years.
• As proposed, the MP would use LL CPUE as the best  index of 
exploitable biomass, and would therefore remain dependant on 
future availability of a reliable LL CPUE index.
Interim Management Procedure
To provide for responsive management, an “interim management 
procedure” (IMP) therefore needs to be put into place within the next 
2-3 years. An inter-sessional workshop is proposed:
• To consider the possible use of the existing operating model, as
implemented for scenarios developed at SAG7, as the basis for 
testing candidate IMPs.
• To generalize the projection software to provide future values for  
indices (such as the Great Australian Bight aerial survey) that 
might perhaps be inputs to an IMP, and to specify appropriate  
statistical characteristics for these indices.
• To discuss the structure of potential simple control rules for  
candidate IMPs, and to specify appropriate performance statistics 
for evaluation purposes.
Review of the SRP
and 2007 Work Schedule
Review of the SRP
•
It was originally intended to fully review the SRP in 2006.  
However, this was deferred to devote efforts to evaluating the 
implications of catch anomalies.
•
The implications of possible past over-catches are such that 
various components of the SRP need to be critically reviewed at 
the 2007 SC meeting.
•
In particular, it is necessary to review catch characterization,
CPUE modeling, the observer program and the conventional 
tagging program, and links between these SRP components.
