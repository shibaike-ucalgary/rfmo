10. The Executive Secretary provided an outline of the financial matters that the meeting 
would need to consider, including the revised budget for 2008 (CCSBT-EC/0810/05), 
the proposed budget for 2009 (CCSBT-EC/0810/06) and amendments to the 
financial regulations of the Commission (CCSBT-EC/0810/07).  Detailed 
consideration of these papers was referred to the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC). 
11. The FAC was convened to consider: 
• the revised budget for 2008; 
• the proposed budget for 2009; 
• the indicative budget for 2010; 
• the “financial statements” and “auditor’s report” from 2007; 
• recommended changes to the Financial Regulations and Financial Rules; and 
• other administration issues. 
12. New Zealand was nominated to continue as chair of the FAC and Australia to act as 
rapporteur, however these decisions were deferred to the FAC to confirm. 
13. New Zealand drew the Commission’s attention to existing agreements with regard to 
quota allocation for the 2010 year and requested that the indicative budget for 2010 
reflect these agreements. 
14. The Extended Commission adopted the report of the FAC, which is at Attachment 7. 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries 
15. National fisheries reviews were considered to have been read by participants.  The 
Chair provided an opportunity for Members and Cooperating Non-Members to ask 
questions in relation to the reports. 
16. Australia outlined its paper providing an update on Japanese market data (CCSBT-
EC/0810/BGD14).  Japan provided a brief outline of its paper (CCSBT-
EC/0810/BGD25) which provided a preliminary analysis on Australia’s paper 
(CCSBT-EC/0810/BGD14).  Japan also briefly referred to its paper on the age 
composition of southern bluefin tuna used for farming (CCSBT-EC/0810/BGD24). 
17. Australia and Japan expressed their intention to work for improvement of monitoring 
of Japanese wholesale markets and Australian SBT farming operations and report 
back the results to the 16th Extended Commission Meeting.  The Extended 
Commission welcomed this cooperative initiative. 
18. Members agreed on the need to work cooperatively in order to clarify the actual 
global SBT catch to the greatest extent possible. 
 
2 
Agenda Item 5. 
Governance – Role of Chair and Commissioners 
19. The Extended Commission agreed to consider appointing Chairs and Vice Chairs for 
a period of two years with the opportunity for reappointment for a further two year 
period after the end of the current rotation, which finishes with the Fishing Entity of 
Taiwan in 2010. In the interim it agreed that the Chair and Vice Chair should work 
more closely together with the Executive Secretary. 
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
20. The outcomes of the Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) development 
work of the Compliance Committee is reported against agenda item 7. 
21. The meeting of the Compliance Committee considered its terms of reference.  A 
paper on strengthening the compliance regime was received from New Zealand and 
this paper was recognised as giving focus for future work. 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Integrated Monitoring, Control and Surveillance System 
22. At its third meeting, the Compliance Committee continued its work to develop 
integrated MCS measures and made considerable progress on developing Catch 
Documentation Scheme (CDS), Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and revised 
transhipment measures. 
23. The Committee agreed on a VMS resolution as provided at Attachment 4 of the 
report of the Third Meeting of the Compliance Committee (CC3) and recommended 
that the Extended Commission adopt this resolution. 
24. The Extended Commission provided additional time for the Compliance Committee 
to finalise the CDS and revised transhipment measures during the meeting of the 
Extended Commission. 
25. The Compliance Committee concluded its work on integrated MCS measures during 
the meeting of the Extended Commission and agreed the following five resolutions: 
• VMS1 (at Attachment 8); 
• CDS (at Attachment 9), noting that the Secretariat will work through the 
resolution , make  corrections that were indicated by the Compliance Committee2 
and circulate it as soon as possible; 
• Transhipment (at Attachment 10); 
                                                 
1 The Secretariat will circulate a summary VMS report format by 31 January 2009 for approval by 
Members by 30 April 2009. 
2 This includes: Correcting paragraph numbering; checking the accuracy of references to paragraphs; cross 
checking the consistency of the text in the resolution to the forms and the forms to their instructions; and 
consideration of deleting the export section of the catch monitoring form given that there is an export after 
landing form that could be used instead. The Secretariat will also review and improve the design of the 
forms in the appendices to the resolution for use of Members. 
3 
• Establishment of a record of authorised farms (at Attachment 11); and 
• An amendment to the register of authorised vessels (at Attachment 12) to reflect 
some details in the CDS paper. 
26. In relation the tagging component of the CDS, Australia clarified its position at 
Attachment 13. 
27. The Extended Commission adopted all five MCS resolutions as recommended by the 
Compliance Committee. 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Australian SBT farming study 
8.1 Examination of 2007-2008 results 
28. The Chair of the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) summarised the discussion 
of the Australian farming study that was considered under agenda item 6 of the ESC 
meeting. 
 
8.2 Discussion of Australian SBT farming study 
29. The meeting welcomed the progress of Australia’s research effort with the stereo 
video camera to improve its monitoring of SBT catches transferred into farms and 
encouraged full implementation of the stereo video technique by Australia as soon as 
possible. 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Recreational fisheries 
30. The Extended Commission adopted the recommendation of the Compliance 
Committee that Members with a recreational catch should report estimates of their 
recreational catch to the Extended Commission on an annual basis. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
31. The Chair of the ESC presented the report of the ESC, which is at Attachment 14. 
32. Following a question and answer session, the meeting agreed to all the 
recommendations from the report of the ESC.  The meeting did not propose any 
revisions to the five alternative constant catch projection options suggested by the 
ESC for producing management advice.  However, it was noted that this advice 
could be provided from the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group 
meeting to be held in Tokyo in April 2009. 
33. The meeting agreed that there was a need to consider streamlining the scientific 
process.  It was agreed that the work of the Scientific Committee for 2009 was 
extremely important and should proceed without interference to the process.  
4 
However, it was felt that a review of the scientific process should be conducted after 
the 2009 scientific process. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
34. The meeting noted that CCSBT 13 set the TAC and its allocation to Members for 
2007 to 2009 for most Members and for 2007 to 2011 in the case of Japan, and that 
the TAC was only to be reviewed if exceptional circumstances emerged in relation to 
the stock.  The Extended Commission reconfirmed its decision on the TAC and its 
allocation as specified in paragraphs 60 to 69 of the CCSBT 13 report. 
35. Indonesia advised the Extended Commission that it is a developing country with a 
historic SBT catch that is considerably greater than its current allocation, and that it 
was seeking consideration of the Commission for an increase in its national 
allocation of the TAC. The Extended Commission confirmed that Indonesia’s TAC 
for 2009 would be 750t, but agreed that it would not impose sanctions on Indonesia 
for small catches above this level during 2008 and 2009. 
36. Members agreed to work with Indonesia to develop a more detailed understanding of 
the Indonesian fishery and its interactions with southern bluefin tuna on the 
spawning grounds. 
37. The European Community advised the Extended Commission that it was seeking 
consideration of the Commission for an increase to its national allocation of the TAC.  
South Africa advised that it was considering joining the CCSBT as a full Member, 
possibly by next year, and it hoped to receive a more equitable national allocation at 
such time.  In support of their requests: 
• The European Community advised that its SBT catch was a small “unavoidable” 
bycatch of its swordfish and shark fisheries and that it did not intend to allow an 
expansion of its SBT catch above the current level of by-catch or to develop an 
SBT fishery; and 
• South Africa advised that it was a coastal state and that it wished to further 
develop its fishery. 
38. The Extended Commission was not able to agree to these requests given the current 
state of the fishery and the TAC decisions made in 2006, nor did the Extended 
Commission agree to relax any of its reporting requirements.  However, the 
Extended Commission noted that the TAC and national allocations will be reviewed 
in 2009 and encouraged Cooperating Non-Members to consider becoming full 
Members prior to that time. 
39. The Extended Commission also agreed to maintain the interim catch allocations for 
2009 for Cooperating Non-Members to the levels specified at paragraph 64 of the 
CCSBT 13 report. 
 
5 
Agenda Item 12. 
Administration of Over/Under Catch 
40. The Extended Commission decided not to implement New Zealand’s proposal 
(CCSBT-EC/0810/BGD/18) for the administration of over-catch and under-catch.  
The difficulty in accurately administering over-catch and under-catch without a CDS 
or other means of verifying catches was also noted. Additional work was conducted 
during the meeting on a proposal to allow carry forward of small percentages of 
uncaught quota on a case by case basis in small coastal SBT fisheries.  However, the 
meeting did not reach consensus on this proposal. 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
CCSBT performance review 
41. The Extended Commission considered paper CCSBT–EC/0810/14. The 
consideration of the performance review recommendations was undertaken against 
Attachment B of that paper.  In summary, in each of the major themes of the paper, 
the Extended Commission: 
Governance and fisheries management 
• Agreed to hold a Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group Meeting in 
Tokyo from 14 to 17 April 2009 to address management objectives, a fisheries 
management plan and stock rebuilding options.  The Working Group would 
comprise Commissioners, fisheries managers and scientific experts from 
Members. The terms of reference for the meeting are at Attachment 15. 
Science 
• Noted that the recommendations concerning science are being addressed by the 
work of the Extended Scientific Committee and that the report of the Chair of the 
Extended Scientific Committee will incorporate a response to these 
recommendations. 
Data 
• Noted that the Extended Commission had taken decisions to require the provision 
of accurate data by members and that these decisions would be supported by the 
decisions of the Extended Commission on an integrated MCS system. 
• Noted that in the long term the CCSBT’s data collection requirements should 
match those of other tuna RFMOs to assist with harmonisation across the RFMOs.  
There should also be a better sharing of data across the RFMOs. 
Ecologically related species 
• Recognised that its lack of action in relation to ERS matters has attracted 
justifiable criticism and noted that: 
o the independent review had identified no barrier to the Extended Commission 
taking binding decisions on ERS; and 
o the Extended Commission would be considering improvements to its activity 
on ERS issues under agenda item 14 including discussion of specific proposals 
to improve performance in this area. 
Compliance 
6 
• Noted that the Extended Commission needed to be able to rely on the data 
provided by members and that it was moving to implement an integrated MCS 
system which reflected the recommendations of the performance review.  It 
acknowledged that further work was required on other measures identified in the 
performance review, but that for the moment priority was being given to finalising 
the MCS package, consisting of CDS, VMS, and transhipment resolutions.  The 
Extended Commission also noted the need to keep these issues under review and 
strengthen their effectiveness. 
Relationships 
• Noted the independent reviewer’s statement that the current CCSBT rules are 
quite restrictive and do not accord with current standards of international best 
practise including transparency. 
• Agreed to reduce the notification period for observers wishing to attend CCSBT 
meetings to 50 days and to amend the rules of procedure accordingly. 
• Noted that its current activities were improving harmonisation with other RFMOs 
in the areas of CDS, transhipment, sharing of science information, and unique 
vessel identification. 
• Noted that CCSBT needed to formalise and agree with the Commission for the 
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) the applicable 
management measures for SBT fishing to be undertaken in the CCAMLR 
Convention Area, consistent with the CCAMLR convention. 
Administration 
• Decided not to extend the meeting time for the Compliance Committee/Extended 
Commission any further.  It was decided that the Extended Commission would 
respond to the recommendations of the performance review by working more 
flexibly at its meetings and intersessionally (including through technology e.g. 
teleconferencing and videoconferencing, e-mail use and making use of 
opportunistic meetings) to optimise the time available for the agendas of the two 
meetings.  It noted that the work of the Compliance Committee and Extended 
Commission would also be improved by rigorous preparation for the meeting. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
42. The Extended Commission noted the critical Performance Review assessment of its 
actions in relation to ecologically related species in both the self assessment 
component of the review and the independent expert’s report. It was noted that this 
was a significant issue that the CCSBT needed to resolve. 
43. Japan presented paper CCSBT-EC/0810/BGD23, which proposed that Members and 
Cooperating Non-members agree to manage fishing for SBT in accordance with the 
seabird by-catch mitigation resolutions of other RFMOs when fishing in their 
convention areas. 
44. Australia presented paper CCSBT-EC/0810/BGD15, which proposed a binding 
CCSBT resolution on seabird by-catch mitigation. 
7 
45. It was agreed that a non-binding recommendation would be developed for the 
CCSBT covering by-catch mitigation for sea birds, sea turtles and sharks. The 
recommendation at Attachment 16 was adopted by the Extended Commission. 
46. The Extended Commission expressed its commitment to managing the impacts of 
SBT fisheries on the marine environment. The Extended Commission also noted that 
the continued work of the Ecologically Related Species Working Group is necessary 
to this end. It was agreed to convene a meeting of the Working Group in 2009 in 
Korea and fund it in the 2009 budget. The Executive Secretary was asked to 
investigate whether it was possible to hold the meeting immediately before or after 
the Extended Scientific Committee meeting 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Cooperating Non-Members 
47. The Executive Secretary outlined paper CCSBT-EC/0810/16 regarding Cooperating 
Non-Members.  He advised that the Philippines and South Africa have been 
generally complying with the CCSBT conservation and management measures.  He 
also advised that the European Community had corresponded with the Extended 
Commission regarding difficulties that they were having with some of the CCSBT 
reporting requirements. 
48. The Extended Commission agreed to continue the Cooperating Non-Member status 
of the Philippines and South Africa.  Members were also happy to note the 
consideration being given by South Africa on becoming a full Member of the 
Commission. 
49. The Extended Commission was encouraged by the European Community’s 
commitment to transpose the CCSBT’s measures into Community law and therefore 
fully abide by the CCSBT’s measures in the future.  With this understanding, the 
Extended Commission agreed to continue the Cooperating Non-Member status of 
the European Community.  Members also encouraged the European Community to 
consider acceding to the convention. 
 
Agenda Item 16. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
50. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/0810/17 on the relationship 
with non-members.  During 2008, contact had been made with only one non-member, 
Belize.  The Executive Secretary noted that the International Merchant Marine 
Registry of Belize had initiated contact with the Secretariat on a number of occasions 
in recent years 
51. Australia advised that the requests for information from Belize were likely to be for 
the purpose of Belize ensuring that they were in compliance with CCSBT measures. 
 
Agenda Item 17. 
Research Mortality Allowance 
8 
52. The Extended Commission agreed to allocate the following Research Mortality 
Allowances for 2009: 
• 1 t for the Japanese recruitment surveys including trolling surveys; and 
• 10 t for Australian pop up tagging in collaboration with New Zealand, Taiwan and 
South Africa and a possible pilot project involving gene tagging. 
 
Agenda Item 18. 
Activities with other organisations 
53. The Executive Secretary outlined paper CCSBT-EC/0810/19 which described the 
activities with other organisations during 2008 and the proposed attendance at 
meetings of other organisations during 2009. 
54. The Chair of the joint tuna RFMO meeting commented that the date and venue of 
next tuna RFMO meeting will be clarified with the European Community in the next 
week and that Members will be advised soon after that. 
55. It was noted that the Secretariat should maintain close liaison with ICCAT, 
particularly in relation to IUU fishing matters. 
 
Agenda Item 19. 
Program of work for 2009 
56. The Extended Commission agreed to the workplan at Attachment 17. 
 
Agenda Item 20. 
Confidentiality of Commission Documents 
57. The Extended Commission agreed that, with exception of Attachment A of paper 
CCSBT-ESC/0809/06 and papers CCSBT-CC/0810/12 and CCSBT-CC/0810/21, 
the documents and reports of meetings under the jurisdiction of CCSBT 15 would be 
made publicly available. 
 
Agenda Item 21. 
Other business 
58. It was noted that the Compliance Committee and Extended Commission meetings 
lasted 6 days in total, with lengthy periods when many participants were inactive 
while documents were being discussed and prepared by others.  Members were 
encouraged to give consideration intersessionally and through bilateral discussions to 
procedures for improving the efficiency of the meeting process and reducing the 
total duration of the meetings to 5 days once this has been done. 
 
9 
Agenda Item 22. 
Close of meeting 
22.1 Election of Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended Commission of the 16th

59. The Extended Commission agreed that the Chair for CCSBT 16 will be Mr Young-
Hyo Ha (Korea).  The Vice-Chair will be nominated by Taiwan. 
60. The Fourth Meeting of the Compliance Committee will be held at Jeju Island, Korea 
on 18-19 October 2009.  The 16th Annual Meeting of the Commission will be held at 
the same location from 20 to 23 October 2009. 
 
22.2 Adoption of report 
61. The report was adopted. 
 
22.3 Close of meeting 
62. The meeting closed at 3:45pm, 17 October 2008.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Thank you and good morning Chair, delegates, ladies and gentleman.  Firstly I would like 
to extend my thanks to Ngati Whatua, the tangata whenua for the powhiri. 
 
We would also like to thank the Government of New Zealand for hosting the 15th session 
of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. 
 
First, Australia would like to formally recognise Indonesia and welcome them to their 
first meeting as a full member of the Commission.  Indonesia’s joining the Commission 
is a very important development: not only are they an important fishing nation and a 
range state for southern bluefin tuna, but now both of the countries whose waters 
surround the spawning grounds of southern bluefin tuna, Australia and Indonesia, are 
members of this Commission. 
 
It is well known to everyone here that we have a fishery that is under considerable 
pressure and it has been for many years.  This is not an unusual situation for a fishery, 
particularly given the globalisation of fisheries, the large number of fishing nations and 
coastal states that catch tuna species and the extensive trade in fisheries, notably tuna. 
These pressures are particularly great on high value tuna species. This makes our job to 
ensure that the fishery is sustainable into the future even harder, but the tools to manage 
the fishery are available. 
 
Clearly we are far from the target we set ourselves for this fishery of rebuilding the stock 
to Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) levels.  In Australia we have recognised that MSY 
is not necessarily the most appropriate target for a fish stock and, for many of our 
fisheries, we have adopted the approach of using Maximum Economic Yield (MEY) as 
an appropriate reference point – and SBT is even further away from being able to meet 
this target.  This Commission needs to commit to managing this fishery in a sustainable 
way and to exercising the political will to make the decisions that will allow this to 
happen. 
 
CCSBT is one of five tuna regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) and in 
many things this Commission has lead the way amongst this group.  Most recently we 
have been the first to complete our performance review.  Australia believes that there are 
no surprises in the outcomes of the review and now all members need to apply the 
political will to implement the required changes, including those identified in 
Ambassador Balton’s independent review.  Australia would see one of the aims of this 
week as being to develop an action plan to implement the required changes. 
 
There is another key issue which I must mention.  This issue has been with us for some 
time and was identified as a key problem in the development of the Southern Bluefin 
Tuna Scientific Research Program (SRP) in 2000.  That issue is the characterisation of 
the catch.  While this may seem like a trivial or easily resolved issue, it is not. 
Furthermore, data drives the SBT stock assessments and to carry out those assessments 
effectively we must have complete and accurate data. Today we have the technology to 
characterise the catch of SBT; what we need is the political will to apply that know how. 
 
We remain concerned about the amount of SBT appearing on Japanese markets and we 
will need to continue monitoring the markets to ensure that public concerns in Australia 
and overseas about over-catch are addressed.  We must implement, as soon as possible, 
essential monitoring, control and surveillance measures, including the establishment of a 
Vessel Monitoring System, a Catch Documentation Scheme and a transshipment control 
measure.  
 
Domestically, Australia has implemented harvest strategies for all our fisheries and we 
believe that CCSBT likewise needs to commit to develop a management procedure which 
will better instruct us on appropriate levels of catch and how we should respond as a 
Commission to changes in stock status. We believe that this Commission must establish 
target reference points for the fishery as soon as possible and associated decision rules to 
guide the Commission in the management of the fishery.  However, while Australia is 
keen to develop a management procedure it is likely to be counter productive unless we 
have a clear understanding of the catch by all Members, Co-operating non-members and 
non-members. 
 
Finally, and importantly, we must minimise the impacts of SBT fishing on ecologically 
related species.  We need to meet not just our responsibilities to our own public 
constituencies, but also to the global public. The plight of many seabird species, in 
particular albatrosses is well recognised and the outlook for some species is dire. Further, 
we cannot ignore the impact that fishing has on sharks, sea turtles and other marine 
species and we must take positive steps to reduce our impact on associated and dependent 
species. 
 
I look forward to a successful and fruitful meeting.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen 
 
On behalf of Taiwan delegation, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the 
Government of New Zealand for providing this excellent venue to hold the meeting. I am 
glad that the Indonesia is one of the members of the Extended Commission of CCSBT. 
As the waters of Indonesia is the spawning ground of southern bluefin tuna (SBT), the 
accession of the Indonesia to the Extended Commission is much important to the 
conservation and management of the resource. I would also like to welcome the 
representatives of European Community and the Philippines of Cooperating Non-
Member.  
 
At the 13th annual meeting of CCSBT, the Members and Cooperating Non-Members 
recognized the critical importance of fully implementing an integrated package of 
compliance measures to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated 
SBT catches. The participants also had heavy discussed on the issues relating to the 
implementation of the draft resolution of catch documentation scheme (CDS), vessel 
monitoring system (VMS) and transshipment at sea respectively. Unfortunately due to the 
difference of the fisheries situation among the members, neither the detailed 
implementation measures on VMS and transshipment at sea, nor the measure on CDS had 
been adopted. 
 
Considering the fact that the IOTC had adopted the resolution on VMS and transshipment 
at sea respectively, Taiwan thinks it is important for the CCSBT to reach consensus on 
the contents of resolution on VMS and transshipment at sea, taking into account the 
principle of harmonization with the measures adopted by the Commission of IOTC. With 
regard to the CDS, according to our outstanding the purpose of CDS is to establish the 
tracking system of SBT so as to ensure the compliance of the management and 
conservation measures. Therefore, it is important and necessary to broadly cover all SBT 
fisheries to reach the objective of fairness as well as to combat and eliminate IUU fishing 
activities. 
 
In principle, Taiwan supports to establish the CDS, and thinks the upcoming CDS shall 
apply to all marine and farm SBT fisheries, taking into account the element of fairness, 
feasibility and simplification. We don’t want to see such measure will become an 
unbearable burden to the fishermen in the midst of up-rising oil prices. In addition, we 
also note the recommendations from the performance review of the CCSBT, and we are 
concerned that this annual meeting how to respond the recommendations from the 
performance review of the CCSBT, such as the timing arrangement of the Compliance 
Committee and the Extended Commission.  
 
In closing, Taiwan will work with my dear colleagues around the table during the course 
of this week and hope the meeting has a fruitful and constructive outcome. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Mr. Chair, distinguished delegates, ladies and  gentlemen, e very good morning to all of 
you. 
 
First of all, on behalf of the Indonesian government and delegation, I would like to 
extend my sincere gratitude to the New Zealand government for hosting this annual 
commission meeting.  Further, I would also thank the secretariat staffs of the commission 
that facilitate and make this meeting to be realized.  We are now here for the 15th annual 
meeting of the CCSBT. 
 
For Indonesia, this meeting is really indispensable. This annual commission meeting is 
the first time for Indonesia to participate under and bearing a new status as a full member 
of the commission. For more than 10 years, Indonesia had been considered as a 
cooperating non-member of the commission. With that previous status, Indonesia had   
been involved and given opportunities to participate in the many aspects of the 
commission activities.  At December 2007, the government of Indonesia ratified the 
commission constitution and hence that was a legal basis for Indonesia submitting 
membership status to the commission. Indonesia acceded to the convention of the 
CCSBT on April 2008. At this very important meeting, Indonesia want to thank to the all 
members and non-members as well as every party that help Indonesia in the process 
through which this new status is  guaranteed.  
 
Being a full member of  the CCSBT, it brings about multifaceted consequences and 
implications. Indonesia now should  involve and participate more actively in the 
management and conservation of southern bluefin tuna. Efforts are also directed to fill 
country responsibilities with respects the constitution, resolutions, decision, and 
regulation of the commission. As a new member, all those responsibilities might be 
difficult to be fulfilled at once. Yet, Indonesia has decided to do its best in support of 
arriving at the objective of the commission.  
 
Internally in Indonesia, Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries that bears main 
responsibilities resulted from this new status. However, other government institutions 
especially Ministry of Foreign Affairs also now pay the serious attention on the issues 
and development of CCSBT. In the parliament of Indonesia, there is a special fisheries 
commission overseeing the fisheries development that also want to see and demand 
positive impact of the Indonesian membership in the CCSBT.  A serious attention is also 
given by Indonesian private sectors that thus far have been looking for the best 
opportunity to utilize and manage southern bluefin tuna resources. Showing their concern, 
there are three officials from Association of  Tuna   Fishing Companies that also form the 
Indonesian delegates and attend this meeting.  
 
Mr. Chair, ladies and gentlemen. The main expectation of  becoming full member of the 
commission is that Indonesia can actively participate in the management conservation 
and utilization of southern bluefin tuna resource. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out 
that there is another target and objective expected to be achieved as a part of Indonesian 
fisheries development programs is that to develop southern bluefin tuna fishery as a 
source of living for many small-scale fishers, operators, and enterprises. Although 
fisheries sector only contributes about 2% to 3% of the total Indonesian Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP), the sector has a significant role in terms of providing employment. The 
government of Indonesia also prioritizes fisheries sector as a means of achieving the 
global consensus  Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), where poverty alleviation is 
one of its components. Within that context and  corridor, Indonesia is now developing its  
fisheries sector where  bluefin tuna is an important element.  
 
Mr.  Chair. In the last two years, Indonesia could not market its bluefin tuna catch due to 
prevailing marketing and trading arrangements. On the other hand, using small-scale 
fleets, bluefin tuna were able to be caught unintentionally. Number of bluefin tuna catch 
in 2007 were somewhat more than 1,000 tons. None of the catch were sent to export 
market. Therefore, it was really a misallocation of that expensive resource as it was 
undervalued and under-priced in the local market. 
 
Indonesia was given 750 ton of total allowable catch (TAC) for 2008. Yet by just using 
that TAC, fishers could not export their catch. At the last year commission meeting, TAC  
for Indonesia in 2009 was not yet determined. Other member countries and even 
cooperating non-members have received their respective TAC  for 2009. Irrespective of 
the reasons underlying the last year decision,  Indonesia humbly want to ask the chair 
prioritize the agenda on the TAC and national allocation and determine the TAC for 
Indonesia in this meeting  
 
With regards to the management of tuna and other highly migratory species, Indonesia 
has taken important steps in order to participate and involve in international fora and 
organization. Beside becoming full member of the CCSBT, Indonesia has been adapted 
as a full member of  the IOTC since 2007. Indonesia is also now in the process of being 
full member of the WCPFC to replace its status now as cooperating non-member.  
Hopefully, by the end next years, Indonesia will have been active members of these three 
tuna RFMO whose competent areas bordering Indonesian waters.  
 
At this very important occasion, Indonesia want extend its greatest regard to the 
government of Australia that through various institutions, arrangements, projects, and 
activities has assisted Indonesia in capacity building and strengthening in research, 
development, and resource management. Our bilateral collaboration has been long 
existed in Benoa Bali through which  a systematic tuna monitoring, enumeration, and 
observer program could be established. From that collaborative project, a reliable data 
and information on the Indian Ocean tuna, including southern bluefin tuna,  can be 
supplied to both national and regional management purposes. Based on the Benoa  Bali 
activities, Indonesia will develop  a formal research institution covering Indian Ocean 
Tuna. To strengthen capacity of the upcoming research station, Indonesia will be still in a 
dire need of  assistance from partner institutions and scientists in Australia.  
 
Until the last scientific committee meeting in Rotorua, it is still accepted that the waters 
south off  Java and Bali Islands are the only spawning and nursery grounds for southern 
bluefin tuna. Hence,  it is our common  responsibility to study, understand, and  properly 
manage the waters and its fisheries so that a long sustained bluefin resource can be in 
placed. In this regards, Indonesia want to invite members and parties to undertake studies 
so that we may have better understanding on spawning aspects of bluefin tuna. 
 
Finally, I would like to end this opening statement by wishing that we shall have 
productive and constructive discussion and sharing of views and ideas, under the spirit of 
cooperation,  in order to come up with results that give long terms benefits to our 
countries.  
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Japan 
 
Good morning. 
 
On behalf of the Japanese delegation, I would like to make a brief comment.  As time is 
limited, I would like to set aside formality and make just two points. 
 
The first is that Japan would like to work constructively at this meeting and make it 
productive. To do that, although there are a number of issues for this meeting, Japan 
promises to make every possible effort to effectively reach a conclusion on the CDS 
(Catch Documentation Scheme) or other compliance measures. 
 
Secondly, I would like to point out that there is a big obstacle for Japan in making such 
an effort.  As I mentioned in the Compliance Committee, I cannot eliminate the doubts in 
relation to growth rate on the SBT farming.  As the Japanese public and media have 
expressed their great interest in this issue, I am determined to overcome this obstacle. 
 
I feel very encouraged after receiving the report on stereo video camera from Australia.  I 
sincerely hope that using this equipment, or by means of weighing at transferring from 
the cage to pens for tagging, weighing at harvest, and by random sampling at the 
transferring, reliable information will be provided to the CCSBT by the end of next 
year’s fishing season.  The elimination of the concern on this issue is key to our 
cooperation with the CCSBT.   
 
Having commented on the above 2 points, I would like to close the opening statement of 
the Japanese delegation.  
Attachment 4-5 
 
Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Chair my opening comments will reflect those of other speakers however some of those 
are worthy of repetition.  Firstly welcome to delegations members and to observers and 
of course a special welcome to Indonesia attending this meeting as a full member. 
 
In recent times it has been rare to have a meeting of this Commission without its own 
special challenges and this meeting is no exception.  Chair the Commission can be 
pleased that it has met the target of completing the review of its performance in the year 
leading up to this meeting.  My congratulations to the Executive Secretary and to 
members who worked hard to produce the self assessment and a summary document for 
consideration by this Commission.  We now have before us a way forward and the 
challenge for this meeting will be to determine a course of action for the Commission to 
improve our performance in a range of areas. 
 
Chair New Zealand as always is here to work constructively with other members to set 
and achieve our goals.  We are committed to performance improvement but in particular, 
as our Chief Executive has indicated we are committed to the core role of this 
Commission which is to ensure that the southern bluefin stock is sustainably managed 
and we manage any impacts of our fishing. Unfortunately in our current situation this will 
mean developing strategies to rebuild the stock rather than maintain its current level.  To 
this end we look forward to working with other delegations during the week and 
constructive outcomes at the meetings’ end. 
 
In closing our warm thanks to Brian for bringing his own style and humour to the 
position over the years.  Also of course our congratulations to Bob and we look forward 
to working with him in the future.

Opening Statement by the Republic of Korea 
 
Good morning! 
Honorable Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen! 
 
It is my great pleasure to attend 15th Annual Meeting of the CCSBT in this beautiful port 
city of Auckland.  On behalf of the Korean delegation, I would extend my deep gratitude 
to the New Zealand Government for hosting this meeting. I also thank the Secretariat for 
its hard work in preparing this meeting. In particular, I would highly appreciate the 
efforts made by Mr. Brian Macdonald as a temporal Executive Secretary to resolve some 
issues within the Secretariat and congratulate Mr. Bob Kennedy on his appointment as a 
new Executive Secretary of the CCSBT. 
 
Above all, I welcome Indonesia’s accession to the Convention for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna and want to see close cooperation in achieving the objective of the 
Convention, that is, the conservation and optimum utilization of southern bluefin tuna. 
 
As regards the agenda, Korea welcomes the progress on CDS, VMS and transshipment 
schemes over the last two days in the Compliance Committee meeting.  Korea hopes that 
resolutions on those issues should be adopted through smooth deliberations of the 
Extended Commission.  These measures should be effective in preventing IUU fishing 
activities, harmonized with those placed in the other relevant RFMOs, cost-effective and 
practicable. Accuracy in reporting southern bluefin catches should be ensured through 
these measures.  
 
Korea highly appreciates the work of the Performance Review Working Group and 
contribution of the independent expert, David Bolton. Recommendations of the PRWG 
are timely and should be duly considered in the deliberations of the Commission. Korea, 
as parties of the UNFSA and many RFMO conventions is committed to the conservation 
and sustainable use of marine resources. 
 
For those important agenda items of this meeting, my delegation will fully cooperate with 
other delegations during the course of meetings so that we can produce tangible results.  
Thank you. 
Attachment 5-1 
 
Opening Statement by the European Community 
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
It is a pleasure for the European Community to be present for the second time at the 
Annual Meeting of the Convention on the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
following our accession as a Cooperating Non-Member in 2006. 
 
The European Community remains committed to fulfilling our obligations to CCSBT as 
well as strengthening this RFMO in order to ensure best conservation and management 
measures for Southern Bluefin Tuna. We have reinforced resources at the European 
Commission just recently to enable us to participate more fully in the CCSBT’s important 
substantive work.  
 
We have participated actively in the third meeting of the CCSBT Compliance Committee 
and in particular wish to underline our support a robust, inclusive Catch Documentation 
Scheme. 
 
As you are aware, the EC does not target deliberately Southern Bluefin Tuna in their 
fisheries in the Southern Oceans.  Inevitably, Community longline vessels have 
sometimes made small unavoidable by-catches of Southern Bluefin Tuna while 
undertaking fisheries for swordfish and shark. The level of by-catches of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna has been extremely minor, between less than 1% to  a maximum of 4% of 
total catch. The EC therefore intends to ask the Commission this year to consider 
granting the EC a modest increase in our cooperation quota, from 10 to 20 tonnes, purely 
to reflect the realities of by-catches by Community vessels and which is indispensable 
given the nature of the Community longline fisheries in this area. 
 
We look forward to participating in this meeting and hope it will be a productive and 
successful one. 
 
Thank you

Opening Statement by the Philippines 
 
On behalf of the Philippine delegation, I would like to express our gratitude to the 
Government of New Zealand  for the gracious hospitality extended to us and for hosting 
the 15th   Special Meeting of the Commission on the Conservation of Southern Blue Fin 
Tuna (CCSBT) in this beautiful City of Auckland, New Zealand.  
 
The Republic of the Philippines since it started attending CCSBT meetings as well as its 
being a Cooperating Non-member (CNM)  has been complying with the management 
measures being implemented by the Commission which demonstrate our commitment to 
the management, conservation, optimum utilization of the fish stocks as well as the 
sustainable development of the fisheries resources in the CCSBT Convention Area.  
 
Rest assured that the Philippines will participate in the discussion of the agenda items in 
this meeting and will articulate our concerns as well as support strong measures on the 
dwindling fish stocks particularly Southern Blue Fin tuna. It is our hope that  the 
Commission will become stronger to manage the fish stocks in the Convention Area. 
 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by the Republic of South Africa 
 
Honourable Chair,  and the distinguished members of the CCSBT. 
 
South Africa wishes to thank the Secretariat of the CCSBT for the opportunity of being 
invited to the Fifteenth Annual Meeting of the CCSBT    
 
After a long period of absence South Africa has attended this meeting for the purpose of 
reviewing its membership as a cooperating non member of the CCSBT, because she is 
presently developing her Tuna Longline Fisheries.  
 
South Africa understands and acknowledges her international obligations, and is 
committed to cooperate with all parties in the conservation and co management of 
Southern Bluefin Tunas.  
 
Once more, South Africa wishes to thank the host, New Zealand for receiving her 
delegates. 
 
THANK YOU! 
 
Attachment 6-1 
 
Opening Statement by the Humane Society International 
 
Thank you Chair. 
 
Following the independent review by Ambassador Balton of the self-assessment of the 
Performance Review, it is apparent that the Commission has a clear mandate to deal with 
the bycatch of seabirds, sharks, and turtles. There is no longer any basis for opposing a 
strategy to deal with ERS, or stalling on the implementation of effective bycatch 
mitigation measures. 
 
A resolution adopted by CCAMLR on international actions to reduce the incidental 
mortality of seabirds arising from fishing (Resolution 22/XXV), recognises that 
populations of species of albatrosses and petrels are unlikely to recover until fisheries-
related incidental mortality is significantly reduced. Thousands of albatross are being 
killed a year by SBT longline fisheries, and these include species heading for certain 
extinction unless the impact of longline fishing is addressed. This Resolution directs 
RFMOs, including the CCSBT, to adequately address and mitigate against seabird 
bycatch, and highlights the importance of bycatch working groups to address seabird 
mortality. Other RFMOs are tackling their bycatch problems, admittedly with differing 
degrees of success. The CCSBT still lags far behind all of them.  
 
The adoption of night setting and line weighting have seen seabird bycatch rates decline 
dramatically under CCAMLR, with zero albatrosses observed captured in the regulated 
longline fisheries in the CCAMLR Convention Area over the last two consecutive years. 
There is no scientific or operational reason why the CCSBT cannot achieve similar 
successes on seabird bycatch. 
 
To address the problem of shark bycatch, HSI recommends the adoption of a non 
retention policy, a prohibition on the use of wire traces, closures for high risk areas and 
times and a total prohibition on finning in the form of a requirement that any sharks that 
are retained should be landed with their fins attached naturally to their carcasses, in 
accordance with the Resolution on Sustainable Fisheries passed by the United Nations 
General Assembly in 2007.  
 
HSI calls for an urgent investigation into the extent of marine turtle bycatch in SBT 
longline fisheries, particularly those operating on the SBT spawning grounds where the 
risk of turtle bycatch is likely to be high.  
 
HSI implores you all, today, to resolve the dispute over the Commission mandates to deal 
with bycatch, and to agree the further convening of the ERS Working Group in 2009 as a 
matter of priority. Further, we urge you to immediately agree effective measures to 
prevent seabird, shark and turtle bycatch – adopting those that have proven to be effective 
in other RFMOs.  
 
Decisive action to address bycatch has been called for in the United Nations General 
Assembly Resolution on Sustainable Fisheries 2006 and 2007, and in CCAMLR 
resolution 22/XXV, and would be consistent with the FAO Code of Conduct for 
Responsible Fisheries, the FAO International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental 
Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries and the FAO International Plan of Action for the 
Conservation and Management of Sharks. 
 
Thank you Chair. 
Attachment 6-2 
 
Opening Statement by TRAFFIC and WWF 
 
Thank you Mr Chairman. 
 
TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, and WWF the conservation 
organization would like to thank the Commissioners of the CCSBT for this opportunity to 
participate as observers to the meetings of the Commission and Extended Commission. 
We look forward to assisting with these critical deliberations and the implementation of 
its decisions, so as to see urgently needed  progress on the conservation of southern 
bluefin tuna and its ecologically related species. 
 
There are still many steps to be taken in this Commission to realize true transparency of 
catch and trade of SBT in order to ensure that IUU fishing for SBT by Members and 
Non-Members stops. We consider that it is imperative that the draft Resolutions on a 
Catch Documentation Scheme, Vessel Monitoring System and Transhipment are 
finalized and implemented as a priority. In addition, there is increasing urgency 
surrounding the discussion and development of the full range of integrated monitoring, 
control and surveillance systems that began at CCSBT13. 
 
TRAFFIC and WWF remain concerned by the lack of progress in ensuring the 
conservation of ecologically related species and of particular concern to TRAFFIC is the 
lack of adequate controls over the recording, catch and retention of sharks. 
 
TRAFFIC and WWF support the development of the management procedure within 
CCSBT and sees its full implementation as a priority. Discussions must focus on 
returning SBT stocks to levels that can be considered biologically safe and consistent 
with the application of the precautionary principle. TRAFFIC and WWF, like many 
others watching the performance of CCSBT, are dismayed by the incredibly poor status 
of the stock despite the years of management through the trilateral arrangements between 
Australia, Japan and New Zealand and then the last 14 years of this Convention which is 
tasked with the SBT’s conservation.  
 
The Commission’s self assessment and the report of the independent expert confirms the 
Commission’s inability, as it currently operates, to recover the stock to biologically safe 
levels or, as the title of the convention purports, to ensure the conservation of SBT. This 
Commission must implement the recommendations of the performance review as a 
priority in order to ensure that it can pursue the objectives of the convention.  
 
In moving forward, TRAFFIC and WWF would like to see the Scientific Committee of 
the Commission tasked with investigating if in fact the current decrementation of catch, 
via a measure of tonnage, irrespective of the size class of the fish, accounts for the 
relative impact on the stock of the various fleets. The fishing of SBT occurs throughout 
the geographic range and age classes of the stock and, given the state of the stock, there 
would be value in confirming whether a differential decrementation system, which 
reflects the relative impact on the stock of the removal of different size classes would 
contribute to rebuilding of the stock. Finally, Mr Chairman, TRAFFIC and WWF have  
been participating in these discussions for the last 15 years. We look forward to a time 
when we can fully associate transparency of process, catch and trade with the Convention 
and that we are all confident we have SBT and its ecologically related species on a 
confirmed sustainable footing. 
 
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
1. New Zealand was nominated to chair the committee and Shaun Driscoll was 
unanimously accepted to that role. Australia undertook the role of rapporteur and 
both the Executive Secretary (Brian Macdonald) and Executive Secretary Elect 
(Bob Kennedy) and Science Committee Chair (John Annala) were present. 
3.1. Revised Budget 2008 
2. The Executive Secretary introduced paper CCSBT-EC/0810/05 (Revised Budget 
2008) for discussion. Discussion highlighted the following points: 
2.1. The revised expenditure for 2008 predicts an under-spend of 1.87% ($30,707) 
against the budget approved at CCSBT14.  
2.2. Considerable savings are achieved in the budgets for the annual meetings and 
the operation of the sub-committees, however, there are significant cost 
overruns (11.82%) in the area of secretariat and office management costs. 
Key over-spend variations include: 
• Other employment expenses  
 
 
$37,100 
o Exit costs for previous executive secretary 
• Executive Secretary recruitment expenses 
 
$90,700 
o Includes recruitment costs for the data manager 
• Office costs 
 
 
 
 
 
$19,300 
o Costs associated with accountancy advice 
2.3. The revised income for 2008 anticipates an increase of $121,693 to 
$1,768,243, mainly due to member contributions from Indonesia of $127,929. 
2.4. As at the date of CCSBT15, outstanding member contributions total 
$174,836. The FAC expressed its concern that contributions are not always 
paid in a timely manner and notes the pressure this places on Commission 
finances. The FAC recommends that the Commission remind all members of 
the need for compliance with Article 11 of the Convention and noted the 
considerable loss of interest income resulting from late payment. It should 
also be noted that in 2009 there will be significant costs incurred early in the 
year requiring the early payment of all member contributions. 
2.5. It should be noted that at page 14, paragraph 2, the CCSBT performance 
review (The Balton Report1) refers to the full and timely payment of member 
contributions. 
3. The Executive Secretary noted that a special account for ‘staff separation 
liabilities’ has been established in line with the FAC recommendation in 2007. An 
initial deposit of $40,000 was made in accordance with the 2008 budget and with 
interest, that account is expected to have a credit balance of $41,200 at 31 
December 2008.

4. The projected surplus from 2008 is expected to total $152,400 which will be 
carried forward against 2009 member contributions. 
5. It is the recommendation of the FAC that the Extended Commission adopt paper 
CCSBT-EC/0810/05 (Revised Budget 2008) as tabled. A copy of the ‘Revised 
Budget 2008’ is attached as Annex ‘A’. 
3.2. Proposed Budget 2009 
6. The Executive Secretary introduced paper CCSBT-EC/0810/06 (Draft Budget 
2009) for discussion, however adjustments were agreed that took account of the 
fluctuating value of the Australian dollar and additional expenditure arising from 
the decisions of the Extended Commission at CCSBT15. Discussion highlighted 
the following points:  
6.1. It is anticipate that a surplus of $152,400 will be carried forward from 2008. 
This surplus will be applied to the 2009 budget in terms of Financial 
Regulations 6.1(c), (d) and (e).  
6.2. The Executive Secretary identified a liability that may be carried forward into 
2009 relating to the appointment of the new data manager. This expenditure 
relates to relocation of the new ‘data manager’ which might not be completed 
in 2008.  If this occurs, appropriate carry forward of budget will occur with a 
nil impact on 2009 budgets. 
6.3. Budgeted costs associated with the operation of the SAG/SC and the sub-
committees were discussed and it was agreed that they were appropriate in the 
context of agreed commitments for 2009. There was, however, a 
recommendation that committee and expert panel composition and operation 
could be formally reviewed ahead of CCSBT16. It was noted that it is about 
ten years since this was last done. 
3.3. The budget includes a payment of $55,000 to the special account for ‘staff 
separation liabilities’. This payment completes the catch-up process and satisfies 
the anticipated scope of the liability going forward. An annual payment to this 
fund will be levied in accordance with U.N. guidelines. For 2009 that payment is 
$19,200. 
7. Australia noted that since 2004 it has sought to have the scientific aerial survey 
funded by all members as it has been consistently identified by the ESC as a high 
priority project. This project has obvious shared benefit for all members and has 
been solely funded by Australia to the tune of more than $2million since 2004 
($640,000 for 2009). In addition the 2008 Scientific Committee agreed that the 
scientific aerial survey index is now to be used in the base case model selected for 
further conditioning of the operating model (SC 2008, para 126,129,130). 
Australia considers that this further supports the case for future funding by all 
Members of the Extended Commission. 
8. While there was appreciation from Members to Australia for this scientific 
contribution to CCSBT, there was no consensus to include this request in the 2009 
budget. 
9. Total gross expenditure for 2009 is projected to be $1,854,468—an overall 
increase from 2008 of 14.77%. This increase reflects an increase in costs 
associated with the various meetings of the Commission in 2009 but member 
contributions are offset by the budget carry forward from 2008 and the member 
contribution from Indonesia. Actual increases to member contributions will 
average 1.5% and are set out in Annex ‘B’. 
10. It is the recommendation of the FAC that the Extended Commission adopt the 
adjusted version of paper CCSBT-EC/0810/06 (Proposed Budget 2009). It has 
been adjusted to take account of budget surpluses from 2008 and the increased 
expenditure items arising from the decisions taken at CCSBT15. A copy of the 
revised ‘Proposed Budget 2009’ is attached as Annex ‘B’. 
3.4. Indicative Budget 2010 
11. CCSBT Financial Regulations require the Executive Secretary to prepare an 
indicative budget for the following year. This indicative budget for 2010 was 
tabled by the Executive Secretary as part of paper CCSBT-EC/0810/06. It 
includes certain assumptions as specified, however these assumptions have 
changed as a result of decisions taken at CCSBT15. 
12. The FAC noted the decision at CCSBT13 (2006) “to simultaneously implement all 
steps of the MOU reached at CCSBT1 relating to the national allocations of 
Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the 2010 fishing year.” 
13. The FAC also noted that the indicative budget should be prepared on the basis of 
existing decisions only and should reflect the financial implications of those 
decisions. Accordingly, the following considerations are factored into the 
indicative budget: 
• 
An increase in the New Zealand allocation in 2010 to 1,000 tonnes; 
• 
A restoration of parity between the allocations of Australia and Japan in 
2010 at 5,665 tonnes; 
• 
Increased secretariat expenditure in relation to the introduction of a 
Catch Documentation Scheme; 
• 
An ERS Working Group meeting is not convened; 
• 
A 5% cost increase (excluding one-off expenditure in the 2009 budget); 
and 
• 
No carry-over funds from 2009. 
14. It is the recommendation of the FAC that the Extended Commission adopt the 
revised ‘Indicative Budget 2010’ as set out in the attachment as Annex ‘C’. 
3.5. Audit Report, Financial Statements and Changes to ‘Financial Regulations’ 
15. The FAC noted that audited ‘financial statements’ for 2007 and the ‘auditors 
report’ for the year ending 31 December 2007 have been supplied to each 
Member. It was also noted that these documents were considered by 
Commissioners at the Special Meeting of the Commission in Tokyo in August 
2008. The following points are noted: 
15.1. The auditor is satisfied that the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with mandatory requirements, including the Commission’s 
Financial Regulations and the Australian Accounting Standards. 
15.2. The auditor noted an issue with general non-compliance with Financial 
Rule 7 in that individual items of expenditure in excess of $5,000 have not 
been approved by the Chair or the Vice Chair of the Commission during 
the year. 
15.3. The auditor further noted that since 2003, it has become practice not to 
comply with Financial regulation 10(2)(b) in that instead of reporting the 
required information in the audited financial statements, the Executive 
Secretary has reported unaudited budget figures to the Commission 
separately each year. 
15.4. The auditor also notes the inappropriate use of the Commission’s bank 
account to pay for private purchases of wine by Commission employees, 
and the incorrect claiming and receiving of tax refunds by the Commission 
for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Wine Export Tax (WET) 
applicable to these purchases.  
15.5. The auditor further noted that during 2007 there had been insufficient 
controls over the use of the Secretariat’s credit card. 
16. The Executive Secretary introduced paper CCSBT-EC/0810/07 (Amendments to 
Financial Regulations) for discussion. This paper seeks to address the issues raised 
by the auditor and following discussion in the FAC the following 
recommendations are made to the Extended Commission: 
16.1. That Financial Regulation 4.4 be amended as follows: 
The Executive Secretary is authorised to make transfers of up to 10 per 
cent of appropriations between items and sub-items. All such transfers 
must be reported by the Executive Secretary to the next annual meeting of 
the Commission in the revised budget submitted to the Commission each 
year. Transfers in excess of 10 per cent will require the authorisation of 
the Chair. 
16.2. That Financial Regulation 9.1(a) be amended as follows: 
The Executive Secretary shall:- 
establish detailed operational financial rules and procedures to ensure 
effective financial administration and the exercise of economy in the use of 
funds – the rules and procedures to be notified to the Commission at each 
annual meeting; 
 
16.3. That Financial Regulation 9.4 be amended as follows: 
Tenders in writing for equipment, supplies and other requirements shall be 
invited by advertisement, or by direct requests for quotation from at least 
three persons or firms able to supply the equipment, supplies, or other 
requirements, if such exist, in connection with all purchases or contracts, 
the amounts of which exceed A$80,000 (Australian dollars). This rule, 
shall, however, not apply in the following cases: 
(a) 
where it has been ascertained that only a single supplier exists and 
that fact is so certified by the Executive Secretary; 
(b) 
in case of emergency, or where, for any other reason, these rules 
would not be in the best financial interests of the Commission, and 
that fact is so certified by the Executive Secretary. 
 
16.4. That a new Financial Regulation 9.5 be inserted as follows: 
For expenditure items less than $80,000 it is generally expected that the 
Executive Secretary will follow the principle of best value for money unless 
specifically directed by the Commission. 
16.5. Note that the lack of credit card controls has not compromised the 
Commission’s financial position or integrity and the Executive Secretary 
has introduced new controls as explained in paper CCSBT-EC/0810/07. 
16.6. Note that in future, the Executive Secretary will report as required by 
Financial Regulation 10.2(b). 
16.7. Note that the budget reporting requirements recommended by the FAC in 
2007 should be amended. It is recommended that before the 15th July each 
year, the Executive Secretary provide a mid-year financial report to 
Members out-of-session, including: 
• expenditure at 30 June and estimates of expenditure for the balance of 
the year; 
• an analysis of contributions paid and the likely end of year cash 
position; and 
• a report on any budget variance and anomalies (including unpaid 
membership contributions). 
16.8. Note that the FAC recommends that the Financial Rule adopted at the 
Resumed Third Annual Meeting of the Commission at Canberra on 18-22 
February 1997, no longer has relevance and should be abolished. All 
matters covered in the Rule are covered elsewhere in Financial 
Regulations and Staff Regulations. 
16.9. Note that the Executive Secretary has arranged to repay the incorrectly 
claimed GST and WET refunds from the Commission’s 2008 budget—an 
amount of approximately $3,000.  
17. The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission adopt the 2007 financial 
statements and the auditors report as tabled and note that all recommendations 
made by the Auditor have been implemented. 
3.6. Other administration 
18. The FAC tabled a request to ensure consistency of numbering of documents for 
CC/EC to avoid duplication of the same documents for both meetings. The 
Executive Secretary will address this issue over the coming year. 
19. The FAC noted that it would be useful to have a table containing consolidated 
outcomes/recommendations of each meeting to be circulated by the Executive 
Secretary after intercessional consultation with the Chair of that meeting. Such a 
list would identify responsibilities and deadlines.

Resolution on establishing the CCSBT Vessel Monitoring System 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), 
 
Recalling that, at its thirteenth annual meeting, the Extended Commission Members 
and Cooperating Non-Members agreed to develop and implement their Vessel 
Monitoring Systems (the 2006 VMS resolution); 
 
Recognising the need for monitoring, control and surveillance measures to apply to all 
sectors of the global southern bluefin tuna fishery; 
 
Recognising the importance of these Vessel Monitoring Systems as an integral part of 
an effective monitoring, control and surveillance regime for the southern bluefin tuna 
fishery, in particular to ensure the long-term sustainability of the stock; 
 
Mindful that a vessel monitoring system was identified as one of the  important 
monitoring, control and surveillance measures to deter illegal, unreported and 
unregulated fishing in the Course of Actions adopted at the Kobe Joint Meeting of 
Tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisations from 22 – 26 January 2007; 
 
Recognising the need to stipulate minimum standards for the Vessel Monitoring 
Systems; 
 
Aware that some Members and other regional fisheries management organizations 
have established Vessel Monitoring Systems and that the experiences of such 
Members and organizations may be useful in developing and implementing a 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna Vessel Monitoring 
System; 
 
Agrees, in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8 of the Convention for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, that: 
 
1. The Members and Cooperating Non-Members of the Extended Commission 
shall adopt and implement satellite-linked Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) 
for vessels fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna on the following basis: 
 
a. for such vessels fishing in the IOTC Area, in accordance with IOTC 
Resolution 06/03 On Establishing a Vessel Monitoring System 
Programme (including Annex 1 to that Resolution);

Measure); 
 
c. for such vessels fishing in the CCAMLR Area, in accordance with 
CCAMLR Conservation Measure 10-04 (2006) “Automated Satellite-
Linked Vessel Monitoring System (VMS)” (including Annex 10-04/A 
and Annex 10-04/B to that Measure); 
 
d. for such vessels fishing in the ICCAT Area, in accordance with ICCAT 
Recommendation 03-14 “Recommendation by ICCAT concerning 
Minimum Standards for the Establishment of a Vessel Monitoring 
System in the ICCAT Convention Area”; and 
 
e. for such vessels fishing in any other high seas area where there is no 
VMS, in accordance with IOTC Resolution 06/03 On Establishing a 
Vessel Monitoring System Programme (including Annex 1 to that 
Resolution). 
 
2. The application of the VMS provided for in paragraph 1(a-e) shall be 
consistent with any modifications to those VMS that may be adopted by those 
respective Commissions from time to time. 
 
3. 
a.  The Members and Cooperating Non-Members of the Extended 
Commission shall provide VMS summary reports annually in advance 
of the Compliance Committee meeting and in the format approved by 
the Commission. 
 
b. 
In relation to incidents concerning specific vessel(s) when the vessel(s) 
are suspected to have operated in contravention of CCSBT 
conservation and management measures, Members and Cooperating 
Non-Members of the Extended Commission may request another 
Member and Cooperating Non-Member of the Extended Commission 
which is the flag state/fishing entity of the vessel(s) to provide VMS 
data on the vessel(s) on a case by case basis.   The Member and 
Cooperating Non-Member which receives such request shall: 
 
(i) 
investigate the incidents and provide details of the investigation 
to the Member or Cooperating Non-Member which requested 
VMS data; or 
(ii) 
provide VMS data on the vessel(s) to the requesting Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member, which will inform the results of its 
investigation to the Members or Cooperating Non-Member 
which is the flag state/fishing entity of the vessel(s).     
 
4. The Extended Commission agrees to adopt the confidentiality and security 
provisions attached in Annex I in relation to the information provided pursuant 
to paragraph 3(b).  
 
5. With the assistance of the Secretariat the Compliance Committee shall review 
and report to the Compliance Committee in 2009 on the implementation of 
this resolution and any possible measures to improve its effectiveness as a 
component of the monitoring, control and surveillance regime for the SBT 
fishery.  Such review shall take account of any developments by other 
RFMOs, including development of a harmonised VMS across tuna RFMOs 
 
6. This resolution does not supersede the 2006 VMS resolution adopted at 
CCSBT 13.

Attachment 9 
Resolution on the Implementation of a CCSBT Catch 
Documentation Scheme 
 
Referring to the principles adopted to guide the development of a catch 
documentation scheme (CDS) at CCSBT12 in 2005 and the ‘Resolution on the 
implementation of a CDS to record all catch of Southern Bluefin Tuna regardless of 
whether the Southern Bluefin tuna were traded’, adopted at CCSBT 13 in 2006; 
Noting the need for Members and Cooperating Non-Members to provide for the 
tracking and validation of legitimate product flow from catch to the point of first sale 
on domestic or export markets; 
Bearing in mind the need to achieve harmonisation of Catch Documentation Schemes 
across Regional Fisheries Management Organisations; 
Emphasising that a CDS must be applied consistently and comprehensively across all 
sectors of the global SBT fishery to accurately confirm the SBT catch by each 
Member and Cooperating Non-member; 
In accordance with Article 8.3(b) of the Convention on the Conservation of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna, the Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna (CCSBT) adopts the following measure to monitor compliance with the 
Commission’s conservation measures: 
1.  General Provisions and Application 
1.1 
All Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall implement the CCSBT 
CDS for southern bluefin tuna (SBT) to document the movement of all SBT as 
outlined in this resolution.  The CCSBT CDS incorporates CCSBT CDS 
documentation and tagging of SBT. 
1.2 
For transhipments, landings of domestic product1, exports, imports and re-
exports under the jurisdiction of a Member or Cooperating Non-Member, all 
SBT shall be accompanied by a document described in section 3 of this 
resolution.  There is no waiver of this requirement. However, the 
exportation/import of fish parts other than the meat (i.e. head, eyes, roe, guts, 
tails) may be allowed without the document. 
1.3 
Transfers of SBT into and between farms under the jurisdiction of a Member 
or Cooperating Non-Member shall be documented on the Farm Stocking Form 
and Farm Transfer Form as applicable. 
1.4 
Members or Cooperating Non-Members that prohibit the sale of fish caught by 
recreational fishers may exempt their recreational fisheries from the 
requirements of the CCSBT CDS.  
                                                 
1 The term ‘landing of domestic product’ means landing of SBT into the territory of a Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member caught by a vessel flagged to that Member or Cooperating Non-Member or 
on the register of fishing vessels of that Member or Cooperating Non-Member. 
 
For farming operations, the term ‘landing of domestic product’ includes movement of SBT from a farm 
under the jurisdiction of a Member or Cooperating Non-Member directly to an exporting vessel in the 
vicinity of the authorised farm site. 
1.5 
The Commission shall request the cooperation of appropriate authorities of 
States other than Members and Cooperating Non-Members of the Extended 
Commission that are involved in catching, landing, transferring and/or farming 
of SBT in the implementation of this resolution. 
1.6 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall not permit the landing as 
domestic product, transhipment, import, export and/or re-export of SBT 
caught by vessels not authorised to catch SBT and (if SBT farming is 
conducted under their jurisdiction) the transfer of SBT to or between, and 
harvest of SBT from, farms not authorised to farm SBT. 
1.7 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall not permit whole SBT to be 
landed as domestic product, transhipped, exported, imported or re-exported 
without a tag, except that:  
1.7.1 in the case of farming operations, the SBT may be landed without a tag 
provided a tag is attached within 30 hours of kill; 
1.7.2 in exceptional circumstances, where a vessel on the CCSBT Record of 
Authorised Vessels does not have sufficient tags on board the vessel, the 
tag may be attached at landing; 
1.7.3 in exceptional circumstances, where a vessel catches SBT as unexpected 
bycatch and has no or insufficient tags on board, the tag may be attached at 
landing. 
1.8 
In exceptional circumstances, where a tag becomes accidentally detached and 
cannot be reattached, a replacement tag shall be attached as soon as possible 
and no later than the time of landing, transhipment or export. 
1.9 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall report any exceptional 
circumstances referred to in1.7.2, 1.7.3 or 1.8 to the Executive Secretary 
within 7 days of the landing.  The report shall provide details of the 
exceptional circumstances, the number of SBT tagged and for1.8, the old 
(where known) and new tag number(s). 
1.10 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall require that tags be retained on 
whole SBT to at least the first point of sale for landings of domestic product, 
and shall encourage the retention of tags on whole fish thereafter.  
2.  Registers Required 
2.1 
A record of farms is to be established and maintained by the Executive 
Secretary to identify authorised farms. 
2.2 
A record of vessels, maintained by the Executive Secretary, identifies all 
authorised vessels. 
2.3 
CCSBT CDS Documents that record information for vessels and/or farms not 
included on the above-mentioned authorised registers shall not be considered 
valid Documents for the purposes of this scheme. 
3.  Documents and Information Required 
3.1 
The CCSBT CDS Documents are : 
3.1.1 Farm Stocking Form – records information on the catch, towing and 
farming of SBT 
3.1.2 Farm Transfer Form – records information on the transfers of SBT 
between farms 
3.1.3 Catch Monitoring Form – records information on the catch, landing, 
transhipment, export, and import of all SBT regardless of whether farmed 
or not, including unexpected catch 
3.1.4 Catch Tagging Form – records information on individual fish tagged as 
part of the CDS 
3.1.5 Re-export or Export after Landing of Domestic Product Form – records 
information on SBT already tracked on the Catch Monitoring Form to the 
initial point of landing of domestic product or import that is, either in full 
or part, exported or re-exported. 
3.2 
The information to be contained in the CCSBT CDS documentation referred to 
in 3.1, along with associated instruction sheets, is in Appendix 1 A – D.

addition of translations, may be made.  No information field may be omitted 
from the standard form, except where the field is not applicable.  
3.4 
Any documentation modified, as described in 3.3, shall be provided to the 
Executive Secretary for distribution to other Members, Cooperating Non-
Members, as well as Non-Members known to be involved in the landing, 
transhipment, import, export, or re-export of SBT. 
3.5 
Significant amendments to the forms and form content may be made only with 
the agreement of the Commission at its annual meeting based on 
recommendations from the CCSBT Compliance Committee. 
3.6 
CCSBT CDS documents must be uniquely numbered.   
4.  Tagging 
4.1 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall require that an SBT tag be 
attached to each whole SBT at the time of kill except:  
4.1.1 in the case of farming operations, the tag may be attached within 30 hours 
of kill;  
4.1.2 in exceptional circumstances, where a vessel on the CCSBT Record of 
Authorised Vessels does not have sufficient tags on board, the tag may be 
attached at landing; 
4.1.3 in exceptional circumstances, where a vessel catches SBT as unexpected 
bycatch and has no, or insufficient, tags on board, the tag may be attached 
at landing. 
4.2 
As outlined at 3.1.4, a Catch Tagging Form records relevant tagging 
information for individual SBT.  The Catch Tagging Form shall be filled in as 
soon as practicable after the time of kill.  Length and weight measurements 
shall be conducted before the SBT is frozen.  Where measurements cannot be 
accurately done on board the vessel, they may be made at the time of landing 
or transhipment, provided the measurements and the associated Catch Tagging 
Form are filled in before any further transfer of the SBT.        
4.3 
Completed Catch Tagging Forms shall be provided to the flag Members and 
Cooperating Non-Members which shall provide the information in the Catch 
Tagging Form to the Executive Secretary in an electronic format on a 
quarterly basis.

SBT, where fields of information required on the form are not completed, or 
where the form has not been validated as required by this resolution. 
5.7 
Full or partial consignments of untagged whole SBT must not be validated or 
accepted for transhipment, landing of domestic product, export (including 
export after landing of domestic product), import or re-export (except where 
the tag is no longer required to be attached to the SBT because further 
processing has occurred, as outlined at Appendix 2).   
5.8 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall undertake an appropriate level 
of audit, including inspections of vessels, landings, and where possible 
markets, to the extent necessary to validate the information contained in the 
CDS documentation. 
5.9

Members and Cooperating Non-members shall cooperate to ensure that CDS 
documents are not forged and/or do not contain misinformation. 
8.  Access to and Security of Information 
8.1 
Subject to each Member’s and Cooperating Non-Member’s national law, the 
information produced from the CCSBT CDS shall be confidential and may 
only be used in support of CCSBT purposes or for any other purpose agreed 
by the Commission. 
8.2 
Where necessary, in support of catch verification procedures, Members and 
Cooperating Non-Members agree to exchange the necessary supporting 
information and, where relevant, evidence as may be necessary to verify the 
integrity of the flow of CDS information and to reconcile any discrepancies. 
9.  Implementation and Review  
9.1 
This resolution will enter into force on 1 January 2010.4  From that date, it 
replaces the CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document Programme 
adopted by CCSBT on 1 June 2000.  For SBT caught before 1 January 2010, 
the tagging requirements of the CDS may be exempted until 30 June 2010 and 
the CCSBT CDS Documents shall be completed in the most practicable 
manner. 
9.2 
The Compliance Committee will review this resolution no later than at its 
2011 meeting to identify any implementation issues, strengths, and 
weaknesses, and to recommend options to improve this resolution and its 
supporting procedures at the Extended Commission meeting. This review will 
include any concerns associated with the breakage or loss of tags and the 
extent of the use of exemptions in 1.8 and 1.9 as reported by Members and 
Cooperating Non-Members to the Executive Secretary.  The date for a 
subsequent review will also be agreed at this time.   
9.3 
The Executive Secretary will monitor available technology associated with

Minimum Procedural and Information Standards for CCSBT Member and 
Cooperating Non-Member Tagging Programmes 
General requirements of an SBT tagging system 
1. As outlined in section 1.7 and 1.8 of the Resolution, the SBT tag shall remain 
on each individual fish while the fish carcass remains whole. A fish remains 
whole despite cleaning, gilling and gutting, freezing, removing fins, gill plates 
and tail and removing the head or parts of the head.  A fish is no longer 
considered to be whole if it has undergone processes such as filleting or 
loining. 
2. Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall take steps to ensure that SBT 
tags cannot be reused. 
Specifications for SBT tags 
3. Each SBT tag shall meet the following minimum standards: 
a. have a unique pre-recorded tag number in an easily readable form; 
b. tag numbering shall include a unique flag state identifier and a fishing 
year identifier (e.g. NZ-2008-000001);  
c. be able to be securely fastened to SBT; 
d. be non-reusable, tamper-proof and secure from counterfeiting or 
replication; 
e. be able to withstand at least negative sixty (60) degrees Celsius 
temperatures, salt water and rough-handling; and 
f. be food safe. 
General requirements for tag related information 
4. Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall record the distribution of SBT 
tags to entities they authorise to fish for, or farm, SBT. 
5. In relation to each tag, Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall ensure 
their vessels and operators, and the relevant authorities have reporting 
procedures and formats allowing the collection of the required tagging

Resolution on Establishing a Program for Transshipment by Large-Scale Fishing Vessels 
 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), 
 
TAKING ACCOUNT of the need to combat illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing 
activities because they undermine the effectiveness of the conservation and management measures 
already adopted by the CCSBT; 
 
EXPRESSING GRAVE CONCERN that organized tuna laundering operations have been conducted 
and a significant amount of catches by IUU fishing vessels have been transshipped under the names of 
duly licensed fishing vessels; 
 
IN VIEW THEREFORE OF THE NEED to ensure the monitoring of the transshipment activities by 
large-scale longline vessels in areas beyond national jurisdiction, including the control of their 
landings; 
 
TAKING ACCOUNT of the need to collect catch data of such large scale long-line tuna to improve the 
scientific assessments of those stocks;

such information for future consideration by the Extended Commission.  
 
11. The Extended Commission and the Members and Co-operating Non-members 
concerned shall communicate with each other, and make the best effort with FAO and 
other relevant regional fishery management bodies to develop and implement 
appropriate measures, where feasible, including the establishment of records of a 
similar nature in a timely manner so as to avoid adverse effects upon other tuna 
resources in other oceans.  Such adverse effects might consist of excessive fishing 
pressure resulting from a shift of the IUU FVs from fishing for SBT to other fisheries.  
  
12. Before the Extended Commission decides to implement measures specified in 
paragraph 8, the Extended Commission and the Members shall contact all the relevant 
countries to inform of this resolution and consult with them, and give them sufficient 
time to adopt themselves to this resolution.  They shall continue to encourage 
non-Contracting Parties to become Members or Co-operating non-Members. 
 
  
13.  This resolution repeals the previous amendment to the resolution on “Illegal, 
Unregulated and Unreported Fishing (IUU) and Establishment of a CCSBT Record of 
Vessels over 24 meters Authorized to Fish for Southern Bluefin Tuna” adopted at the 
Eleventh Annual Meeting from 19-22 October 2004.

Australia’s clarification in relation to its measuring of SBT 
in the tagging component of the CDS 
 
Australia has some difficulty with the concept of reporting both length and weight in the 
tagging report associated with the CDS.  We would note that we have submitted to the 
CCSBT the independent expert advice that the taking of the weights and lengths of farm fish 
at harvest has no value to the stock assessment. In terms of compliance it does not provide 
anything additional to the provision of the individual weight of a fish. 
 
Compliance with this aspect of the resolution will cost Australian industry many hundreds of 
thousands of dollars per year. This additional cost arises from the fact that the speed of the 
processing lines will be significantly reduced. 
 
However, in recognition of the importance of the CDS Resolution being a key component of 
the MCS measures required to be implemented by the Commission, Australia has agreed that 
length and weight data form part of the reporting forms, including the SBT farm harvests. 
 
Australia notes that as part of the review process of the CDS system, the practicalities of 
providing the data will be considered.  We will report back to the Commission on this issue 
and would seek members understanding of the practical difficulties involved.

Terms of Reference 
Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group 
 
In response to the recommendations of the performance review of the Extended 
Commission completed in 2008, the Extended Commission has agreed the following 
Terms of Reference for a Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group 
(SFMWG).   
 
Composition  
1. The SFMWG shall consist of the Commissioners from members of the 
Extended Commission, the Secretariat, and as appropriate, other experts in 
fisheries management and fisheries science. Numbers of participants will be 
kept to a minimum. 
 
2.  The first meeting will be chaired by Japan. 
 
Functions 
3. The broad purpose of the SFMWG shall be: 
 
i. To develop a draft Strategic Plan (SP) which sets out a common view 
of the strategic direction of the Extended Commission in managing the 
SBT fishery.  
ii. To develop a draft Fisheries Management Plan (FMP) for Southern   
Bluefin Tuna (SBT) comprising management objectives for the SBT 
stock and ecologically related species consistent with modern standards 
of international fisheries management 
iii. In relation to ii, develop: 
• a rebuild strategy for SBT that is consistent with the UN Fish 
Stocks Agreement and the precautionary approach 
• other technical measures for managing the SBT stock, as 
appropriate 
 
4. The SFMWG shall take into account any relevant advice from the subsidiary 
bodies of the Extended Commission.  
 
Workplan 
5. The first meeting of the SFMWG will focus on item iii outlined above. 
 
6. The first meeting SFMWG will be held in Tokyo, Japan, from 14-17 April 
2009 and any necessary follow up work to the SFMWG meeting will be 
completed intersessionally before CCSBT16. 
 
7. The recommendations of the SFMWG will be considered by the Extended 
Commission at CCSBT16. 
Attachment 16 
 
Recommendation to Mitigate the Impact on Ecologically Related Species of 
Fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna 
 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Concerned that some seabird species, notably albatrosses and petrels, are threatened 
with global extinction, 
 
Mindful that fishing for southern bluefin tuna can also cause incidental harm to other 
species such as sea turtles and sharks, 
 
Recalling the definition of ecologically related species in Article 2 of the Convention 
for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Further recalling the requirement in Article 5(2) of the Convention for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna that the Parties shall expeditiously provide to 
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna data on, inter alia, 
ecologically related species. 
 
Determined to mitigate incidental harm to ecologically related species caused by 
fishing for southern bluefin tuna, 
 
Noting the importance of harmonising conservation and management measures with 
other organisations responsible for managing international fisheries, as agreed at the 
Kobe Meeting of Joint Tuna RFMOs on 26 January 2007, 
 
Reaffirming the recommendation at the seventh meeting of the Ecologically Related 
Species Working Group (ERSWG) held in Tokyo from 3 to 6 July 2007, that 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members will provide national reports on their 
interactions with ecologically related species in southern bluefin tuna fisheries to the 
ERSWG, 
Recommends that: 
 
1. 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members will, to the extent possible, implement 
the International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catches of Seabirds in 
Longline Fisheries (IPOA-Seabirds), the International Plan of Action for the 
Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA-Sharks), and the FAO Guidelines to 
reduce sea turtle mortality in fishing operations (FAO-Sea turtles), if they have not 
already done so. 
2. 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members will comply with all current binding 
and recommendatory measures aimed at the protection of ecologically related species, 
including seabirds, sea turtles and sharks, from fishing, which are adopted from time 
to time: 
a) 
by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, when fishing in its Convention 
area, and 
b) 
by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, when fishing in 
its Convention area, 
irrespective of whether the Member or Cooperating Non-Member concerned is a 
member of the relevant Commission or otherwise cooperates with it. 
3.   Members and Cooperating Non-Members will collect and report data on 
ecologically related species to the Extended Commission and/or its subsidiary bodies 
as appropriate, including the Ecologically Related Species Working Group.  Further, 
the undertaking described in paragraph 2 will include a commitment to comply with 
measures adopted by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and the Western and 
Central Pacific Fisheries Commission on the collection and reporting of data in 
relation to ecologically related species.  Data confidentiality shall be protected under 
the rules that apply in those Commissions. 
4.   Members and Cooperating Non-Members will report annually to the 
Compliance Committee of the Extended Commission on the action they have taken 
pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this recommendation. 
5.  
The Secretariat of the CCSBT is authorised to collect and exchange relevant 
data concerning ecologically related species with the Secretariat of the Indian Ocean 
Tuna Commission and the Secretariat of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 
Commission. 
6.  
The Extended Commission will review the operation of this Recommendation 
with a view to enhancing the protection of ecologically related species from the 
impacts of fishing for southern bluefin tuna. 
7.  
The Extended Commission and/or its subsidiary bodies as appropriate will 
undertake an assessment of the risks to ecologically related species posed by fishing 
for southern bluefin tuna.  The Extended Commission will consider how these risks 
are mitigated by the adoption of measures described at section 2, and will consider 
whether any additional measures to mitigate risk are required.
