REPORT OF THE SIXTH ANNUAL MEETING 
 (Second Part) 
21 to 23 March 2000 
 
Agenda Item 1: 
Opening of Meeting 
 
1.1 
Adoption of Agenda 
 
1. 
The Chair, Mr Peter Yuile of Australia opened the meeting and welcomed member 
delegations from Australia, Japan and New Zealand and observers from the Republic of Korea, the 
Republic of South Africa and Taiwan.  The Chair noted that Messrs Hurry and Hausknecht were 
representing CCAMLR. 
 
2. 
The agreed agenda and list of participants are at Attachments A and B respectively. 
 
3. 
The Chair invited the observers to make comments on particular issues as they arose during 
the agenda. 
 
1.2 
Opening Statements 
 
4. 
Opening statements by Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Korea, South Africa and Taiwan are 
at Attachments C, D, E, F, G and H. 
 
 
Agenda Item 2: 
Relationship with Non-Members 
 
2.1 Indonesia, Korea, South Africa and Taiwan 
 
5. 
Australia and New Zealand noted the importance of securing the accession or formal 
cooperation of non-members fishing for SBT and expressed their desire to urgently pursue 
negotiations with key non-members.  Australia and New Zealand noted that non-members had been 
reminded of their international obligations and of the need to take into account the quota reductions 
undertaken by CCSBT members, and their continued restraint.  Both members acknowledged the 
cooperative measures that Korea and Taiwan had taken in voluntarily limiting their catch.  New 
Zealand noted that as a result of the steps taken by the Commission to obtain cooperation there is 
no longer unrestrained access to the depleted SBT fishery.  
 
6. 
Japan advised that since the last Commission meeting, it had undertaken further bilateral 
consultations with Korea to persuade it to accede to the Commission and encouraged it to accept 
the offer made by the Commission at its last meeting. 
 
7. 
Korea advised that it regretted the position taken by the Commission in offering a quota of 
1000 tonnes, referring to its position that a 1500 t quota more closely reflected Korea's catch. Korea 
also noted that a quota of 1000 tonnes was below their catches from 1996 to 1998 and any 
reduction below 1500 tonnes would place additional economic pressure on the industry at a time of 
economic depression.  Korea explained that at the time 1000 tonnes had been requested , officials 
had not been aware of the current catch levels of their fishing fleet.  Recent catch data indicated 
catches were in the order of 2000 tonnes and therefore in its view a quota of 1500 tonnes was 
reasonable.  Korea stated that the increase in catch after Korea had proposed a 1000 tonne 
 
2 
allocation was not designed to increase Korea’s allocation but was caused by the fall of the won in 
1997.  
 
8. 
 On Indonesia, Australia advised there had been a positive meeting recently with Indonesian 
officials at an Indonesia-Australia fisheries workshop. The SBT issues discussed concerned the 
quantity of SBT taken by Indonesia, whether the catch was taken within the Indonesian EEZ, the 
size of vessels and whether the catch was taken as targeted-catch or as by-catch. Australia also 
advised that Indonesia also requested assistance to gather information on spawning season, location 
and depth at which spawning occurs, so that Indonesia could consider approaches to minimize the 
level of by-catch.  
 
9. 
Australia noted also the catch of SBT was primarily taken as by-catch within the Indonesian 
EEZ by small longlining vessels (Australian scientific paper provides greater detail). There was a 
wide variety of estimates of catch, varying from an Indonesian industry estimate of 150 tonnes to 
800 - 850tonnes by the Indonesian government to 2500 by Australian scientists. While Indonesia 
has indicated interest in future membership of the Commission, according to Australia, Indonesia 
has concerns regarding compensation for catch reduction in the spawning grounds and the level of 
the membership fee. Also, there were a number of questions regarding the monitoring of 
Indonesian catch, which may be covered through port sampling. Australia and Japan expressed 
interest in working jointly on a government sampling program in Indonesia. Japan urged Australia 
to liaise with IOTC in improving information regarding Indonesia's catch of SBT, as at IOTC, it 
was decided to have port sampling that would provide more detailed data.  Australia noted it is 
liaising with the IOTC and believes that early research in the spawning ground would be 
particularly useful. 
 
2.2 
Action Plan 
 
10. 
Consideration was given to the draft Action Plan, Attachment L to the report of 
Commission meeting CCSBT6(1) held in November. Japan advised that it had taken a number of 
measures to address non-member and flag of convenience (FOC) vessels' catch, including 
monitoring of imports, seeking the cooperation of trading companies in excluding the importation 
of tuna from FOC operators and the heightening of consumer awareness through labeling of origin 
countries. 
 
11. 
In relation to FOC vessels, it was noted that ICCAT had introduced trade restrictions on 
bluefin tuna etc. for FOC countries, and that ICCAT and IOTC had adopted a resolution to urge 
their Parties’ importers to refrain from importing tunas taken by FOC vessels.  Japan also suggested 
a special CCSBT meeting be held in June to discuss the identification of non-members who are not 
taking any steps towards cooperating with the CCSBT in accordance with procedures mentioned in 
the Action Plan. 
 
12. 
Korea reiterated its concerns regarding what it saw as an excessive burden on its industry.  
It also expressed concern that as negotiations on quota were continuing and Korea had taken action 
to voluntarily restrain catches, it was too early to take action set out in the Action Plan.  In addition, 
it considered that this action attempted to impose requirements on non-members beyond UNCLOS 
provisions. Commission members assured Korea of their intent to pursue further negotiations with 
Korea at the meeting and subsequently. 
 
13. 
Members agreed on a Resolution to give effect to the Action Plan (Attachment I).   In 
doing so, members recognised that specific procedures for implementation would need to be agreed 
 
3 
between members before any particular action could be taken under the Resolution.  In executing 
aspects of the Action Plan, Australia and New Zealand stressed the critical importance of ensuring 
that any proposed measures are consistent with the members’ obligations under international law, 
particularly those under the WTO instruments.  
 
14. 
The Chair pointed out that the Resolution was not aimed at non-members that cooperate 
with the Commission and that it was not intended to undermine negotiations with non-members. 
The Resolution was intended to address the operations of non-members and vessels whose actions 
were undermining the Commission’s management arrangements.  The Resolution was intended to 
encourage non-members to join the Commission or cooperate with the management arrangements.  
Korea expressed concern that it was too early to take this approach when there had been a failure 
within the Commission to arrive at an agreed TAC. 
 
15. 
Japan undertook to draft a letter of request, for consideration by members, to be sent out to 
non-members in accordance with the first operative paragraph of the Resolution. 
 
 
Agenda Item 3  
Implementation of the Trade Information Scheme 
 
16. 
It was noted that the Commission had approved a Trade Information Scheme at 
CCSBT6(1), subject to resolution of some procedural arrangements.  The Executive Secretary 
advised that details of the scheme approved at that meeting were sent to non-members identified by 
Japan as having exported SBT to Japan within the last 5 years, and to other relevant international 
fishery Commissions.  Although the scheme had been circulated widely, it was noted that to date, 
only China had provided information on validation arrangements.   
 
17. 
During the meeting Korea and Taiwan provided samples of seals and signatures for 
validation of statistical documents.   
 
18. 
Taiwan indicated that while they had some reservations at CCSBT6(1) on its ability to 
comply with the 1 June starting date of the Scheme, they confirmed that arrangements would now 
be in place by 1 June.  
 
19. 
New Zealand advised that the names of signatories that would be authorised and seals for 
validation of documents would be provided to the Secretariat shortly. Australia advised that the 
necessary documentation would also be provided shortly and requested some minor amendments to 
the statistical document to accommodate product exported from the tuna farms.  Australia also 
advised that domestic arrangements for the introduction of the Scheme were being finalised and 
that the Australian Customs Service had been informed of its introduction. Australia stated that it 
saw the full commitment of all members to the TIS as very important. For this reason it was 
important that Japan fully participate in the scheme and provide the same level of information on 
its domestic catch that other parties are expected to provide. 
 
20. 
Japan advised that, while it had been proposed that the Secretariat receive and process the 
raw data, Japan's view was that it was more appropriate for the importing country to process the 
raw data and then transmit that data to be maintained by the Secretariat.  After discussion, the 
parties confirmed that the Secretariat should be responsible for compiling data and maintaining the 
database. Japan also advised of the progress for amendment of its relevant domestic regulations and 
the wide circulation of information relating to the scheme to industry and relevant commercial 
organizations. 
 
4 
 
21. 
Members discussed proposed changes to operational arrangements for the scheme and the 
request from Australia with a view to finalising before the end of the meeting. Members agreed to a 
finalized "Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document Program" as attached (Attachment J). 
 
 
Agenda Item 4  
Secretariat Work Program 
 
4.1 
Schedule of Meetings 
 
22. 
Members considered that arrangements for scheduling meetings had not been satisfactory 
and that there was a need to establish a fixed annual schedule so that meeting dates are set 
sufficiently far ahead to allow adequate preparation and the effective engagement of external 
scientists.  Members considered that it was important to determine the Commission's priorities and 
a logical sequence and timing of meetings consistent with those priorities. Australia and New 
Zealand stressed the importance of convening a Scientific Assessment Process Workshop 
(SAPWS) to provide the basis for an improved scientific assessment process including the external 
panel, to be followed by a Management Strategy Workshop (MSWS) to provide an improved basis 
for management decisions by the Commission.  Japan shared the same view on the importance of 
the SAPWS/MSWS.  Japan especially stressed the importance of holding the SAPWS as soon as 
possible in order to restore the functioning of the scientific process of the Commission as early as 
possible so that the Commission would be able to set an agreed total allowable catch (TAC) for 
year 2001, noting that its original proposal had been to hold the SAPWS/MSWS in the late March 
and current proposal was late April. Japan explained its view on a meeting schedule for setting the 
TAC for 2001 by the end of November 2000. This schedule included a special meeting of the 
Commission to discuss identification of non-cooperative non-Members in accordance with the 
Action Plan, two meetings of the Experimental Fishing Program Working Group to discuss the 
design of EFP 2000 and another special meeting of the Commission to adopt the EFP 2000.   New 
Zealand proposed that a meeting of the Ecologically Related Species Working Group should be 
held in 2000, given the last meeting was held in 1998.  Japan considered that other meetings had a 
higher priority and it was more appropriate to schedule an ERS meeting in 2001. 
 
23 
Members agreed to hold the SAPWS and MSWS in the week of May 22 and May 29 
respectively. The schedule after these meetings will be discussed among Members intersessionally.  
 
4.2 
Arrangements for Data Management 
 
4.2.1 Trade Information Scheme 
 
24. 
As part of efforts to improve the quality of information about catch and trade in SBT, the 
Commission intends to implement a Trade Information Scheme (TIS) that requires internationally 
traded SBT to be accompanied by approved documentation.  The Commission parties wish to 
ensure that the TIS, and subsequent steps are taken to ensure that the Commission's conservation 
and management measures are not undermined, are transparent, non-discriminatory and consistent 
with their international obligations. 
 
25. 
The Parties wish to share information on their respective monitoring regimes with a view to 
achieving transparency consistent with confidentiality requirements. To that end the Parties are to 
exchange information on their respective regimes that require the provision of aggregated catch 
effort data as a minimum standard, the monitoring of catch, landings and non-retention practice by  
 
5 
their vessels, their use of observer programs, licensing systems and other relevant elements of their 
compliance regimes.  
 
26. 
The Parties decided that the Commission meeting following CCSBT6(2) would discuss the 
establishment of a Compliance Committee as appropriate to provide an appropriate forum for 
discussion of the Parties compliance arrangements and the activities of non-members whose vessels 
have been catching SBT in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of the Commission's 
conservation and management measures.  (Secretariat note:  the report of CCSBT 4(1) states that 
“The Commission adopted the draft terms of reference (TOR) for the Compliance Committee 
(Attachment K)” ). 
 
4.2.2 Fishery Data 
 
27. 
Members agreed to establish a database for the purpose of information exchange with other 
regional fisheries management organizations, provision of information to the public, monitoring the 
Trade Information Scheme and provision of data for stock assessment to both Members and 
external scientists. Members also agreed to employ a database manager. To permit the early 
introduction of the database, members intensively discussed the terms of reference for the database 
and database manager, database format and data confidentiality requirements. A draft text of these 
issues to be discussed intersessionally is attached (Attachment K). 
 
Agenda Item 5: 
Scientific Program 
 
5.1 
Selection of Chairs of SC/SAG and Advisory Panel 
 
28. 
Members noted the list of external scientists selected as Chairs of the SAG and SC and 
members of the Advisory Panel as follows: 
 
 
Chair of SC:  
 
 
Andrew Penny 
 
Chair of SAG:  
 
 
John Annala 
 
Members of Advisory Panel:  
Rick Deriso 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ana Parma 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Jim Ianelli 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ray Hilborn 
 
29. 
Having agreed on the list of external scientists, all members highlighted the need to 
progress the scientific issues as quickly as practicable.  It was noted that one of the persons selected 
as a member of the Advisory Panel was not be available for a meeting of the Stock Assessment 
Process Workshop and the Executive Secretary was requested to clarify his availability as soon as 
possible and report the outcome to members.  Australia expressed the view that if his availability 
was limited, members should consider selecting an alternate/alternative person. The parties agreed 
that the additional member of the Advisory Panel will be selected as soon as possible after 
CCSBT6(2), though it must not delay the SAPWS. Even after an additional member has been 
selected, the original members will continue to be members of the Advisory Panel and will be 
invited to participate in the Panel's activities.

5.2 
Workshops 
 
5.2.1 Report from the Peer Review Workshop 
 
30. 
Reports of both the first and second round of the Peer Review Workshop were adopted as 
attached (Attachment L and M). 
 
5.2.2 Arrangements for the Stock Assessment Process Workshop 
 
31. 
Members agreed to hold a SAPWS commencing on May 22, 2000 in Japan. Terms of 
Reference and Agenda of the Workshop will be finalized intersessionally among Members. 
 
5.2.3 Arrangements for the Management Strategy Workshop 
 
32. 
Members agreed to hold MSWS commencing from May 29, 2000 in Japan. Terms of 
Reference and Agenda of the Workshop will be finalized intersessionally among Members. 
 
5.3 Scientific Experimental Research Program 
 
5.3.1 Experimental Fishing Program 
 
33. 
Japan distributed a paper CCSBT/0003/20(Attachment N), Proposal for Joint Experimental 
Fishing Program (EFP) without prejudice to Japan's position on arbitration under UNCLOS Annex 
VII.  The paper included the establishment of a Working Group, which would include external 
scientists of the Advisory Panel, to facilitate the planning of a joint EFP.  As the paper was not 
available before the meeting Japan sought general comments with the view to more detailed 
consideration either out-of-session or at the next available meeting. 
 
34. 
The Chair noted that the Heads of Delegation had reaffirmed the  two-week rule: papers 
must be submitted two weeks ahead of the meeting in order to be the subject of substantive 
discussion. 
 
35. 
Japan advised that the purpose of the proposal was to resolve the disagreements in stock 
assessment among Commission members. Japan's proposal was based on the consensus among 
parties at last year's EFPWG on a three year (1999-2001) duration of the EFP. To establish and 
progress the program, Japan proposed the program be set in consultation with the Advisory Panel 
and through consultation and a consensus of Commission members. To ensure adequate time was 
given to the design of the EFP 2000, Japan proposed that EFP Working Group promptly begin a 
discussion of the joint EFP. Japan suggested that it would be a practical way to start talking about 
joint EFP design for 2000 by allocating time during the Management Strategy Workshop, which 
would be held in late May.  
 
36. 
Under the proposal, the joint EFP would be carried out during 2000 and 2001, commencing 
in August 2000. While Japan advised that it did not believe that previous programs had affected the 
SBT stock, an annual maximum limit of 1500 tonnes would be put in place, to achieve a consensus 
and to take account of Australia and New Zealand’s position, in the spirit of cooperation and 
compromise. Were the limit to be unavoidably exceeded, in order to adhere to the EFP design and 
ensure the scientific reliability of resulting data, it was proposed that the excess would be taken 
from the national quota of the program participants in subsequent year.  
 
7 
 
37. 
Japan welcomed the comments of the other Parties and said it is prepared to take such 
comments into account in formulation of a revised proposal. 
38. 
Australia and New Zealand thanked Japan for its proposal and advised that as they had not 
had time to examine it, they would do so intersessionally, with a view to providing comments at the 
next meeting of the Commission.  On that understanding and without prejudice to Australia and 
New Zealand’s position in the current Annex VII Arbitration, the following initial comments were 
made. 
39. 
Australia noted that contrary to the view put forward by Japan, in Australia's view, there is 
no real difference between members of the Commission on the current status of the SBT stock.  
Australia noted also that in its view, it was accepted by all members of the Commission that the 
stock is at historically low levels and remains a cause for serious biological concern.  Australia 
recalled that the disagreement with Japan relates to the future projections of the stock and reminded 
Japan that these differences could not simply be resolved by CPUE data as Japan argues.  Australia 
reminded Japan that there are other uncertainties in the stock assessment that are very important to 
resolve and cause much more of the difference between Australia and New Zealand’s projections 
and those of Japan.   
40. 
In addition, Australia highlighted the need for a properly constructed scientific research 
program for SBT.  In developing such a program, Australia noted that one element to be considered 
may be a small, scientifically valid EFP.  Australia explained that in considering an EFP, tonnage is 
not the only issue.  Australia would need to be convinced that an EFP is well designed, and is not, 
in reality, a front for more commercial fishing.  In concluding, Australia urged Japan to consider 
with an open mind the suggestions for scientific research contained in Australia’s paper entitled 
Potential Future Research Activities for a Southern Bluefin Tuna Research Program (‘SBTRP’). 
 
41. 
New Zealand observed that while it had not had sufficient time to give detailed comment, it 
supported increasing knowledge of the SBT stock though sound scientific research and restated its 
commitment to resolving uncertainties. New Zealand stated that Japan’s EFP proposal might not be 
the most effective way to achieve this objective.  New Zealand noted its serious concern that the 
focus on consideration of an EFP and the imposition of a series of EFP meetings jeopardised the 
work of the parties directed at re-establishing the scientific process. New Zealand stated it was 
committed to allocating the necessary resources to that process to allow member scientists and the 
advisory panel to develop a renewed assessment for the Commission to use for management 
decisions. 
 
42. 
Japan thanked Australia and New Zealand for their comments and replied that in its view, 
interpretation of CPUE data was the biggest uncertainty in stock assessment of SBT and it had been 
agreed by all members that it resulted in the difference of both current stock assessment and 
projections of future recovery among the parties. Japan further stated that all members have also 
agreed that steps should be taken to resolve the uncertainty in this area, and it did not expect a 
quick change of mind from Australia and New Zealand but did hope to make progress in a 
reasonably brief period of time. With respect to New Zealand's comment that this proposal 
jeopardized the 2000 scientific work process, Japan further explained its intention of the proposal 
to assist in the normalization of the stock assessment process. Japan also noted that some of the 
elements of Australia's proposal on the future scientific agenda have been included in the 1998 and 
1999 EFPs and that an EFP should have a place in Australia's proposed agenda as well, since catch 
 
8 
data collected through the EFP are necessary for CPUE analysis.  Japan's paper was left with 
Commission members for further consideration. 
 
 
5.3.2 Others 
 
43. 
Australia distributed paper CCSBT/0003/13 entitled, Potential Future Research Activities 
for a Southern Bluefin Tuna Research Program (‘SBTRP’) and provided a brief overview of the 
paper.  Australia explained that the objective of its paper is to promote discussion on the 
establishment of an integrated program of scientific research on SBT, focused upon reducing key 
uncertainties and improving the basis for scientific advice on SBT.  Australia noted that the paper 
sets out a list of potential on-going and future research activities that could be conducted under 
such a program.  Australia noted that its paper had not been circulated two weeks prior to the 
meeting and advised that it would be pleased to discuss matters contained in the paper in greater 
detail intersessionally or at the next appropriate meeting. 
 
44. 
Japan thanked Australia for circulating its proposal and offered preliminary comments on it. 
In order to make rapid progress toward normalisation of the scientific process, Japan considered it 
necessary to prioritise among possible research projects, rather than simply listing them. Japan 
noted that apart from proposed research on the spawning ground, Australia’s proposal did not 
include any research involving the catch of SBT, such as a joint EFP, and further noted that 
research activities involving well-controlled catch were widely recognised as an important element 
of sound fisheries management. Japan stated that it would be happy to provide its own views about 
the establishment of both long term and short term research programs as well as a range of research 
needs as appropriate on later occasions.    
 
45. 
In response to Japan’s comments, Australia noted that its paper had been tabled in good 
faith in order to provide the Commission with options to address the areas of disagreement that 
exist and to assist members in finding a constructive way forward on scientific research.  Australia 
expressed its disappointment that Japan had, in its comments on the paper, chosen to focus only on 
the issue of an EFP.  Australia urged Japan to consider with an open mind research activities that 
might be included in a broader, integrated scientific program.  Australia clarified that the list of 
potential future research activities contained in the paper had been developed having regard to the 
severely depleted state of the SBT and of the need to prevent further deterioration of the stock.  
Australia noted also that the list of potential research activities is not exhaustive and had been 
advanced in order to promote discussion.  Australia’s paper was left with Commission members for 
further consideration.   New Zealand suggested the approach outlined in the Australian proposal 
which described a number of potential approaches that could be evaluated to determine the most 
effective means to reduce uncertainties in the assessment at least risk to the stock.   
 
 
Agenda Item 6: 
Total Allowable Catch and National Allocation 
 
46. 
Japan reiterated its position stated at the previous meeting that, based on the latest available 
stock assessment, the TAC should be set to include a component to cover catches by non-members 
as well as an additional 3000 tonnes above that already allocated to members.  Japan urged that, in 
order to restore the functioning of the Commission, the TAC should be set for 2001, which would 
require meetings of the Scientific Committee and the Commission to be held in 2000 to meet this 
timetable. Japan also stated that all the members should make every effort to achieve this goal. 
 
 
9 
47. 
Australia noted that it had stated its position on the TAC at the first meeting and did not 
wish to revisit that statement. However, Australia noted that this was a critical area and that it was 
important to agree on a TAC if possible for 2001.  
 
48. 
New Zealand noted it was important to implement the improvement to the scientific process 
to provide resource assessment in order to allow the Commission to determine a new TAC.  While 
it would be preferable to be able to decide on a TAC in 2001, as proposed by Japan, it was 
important to provide adequate time so as not to jeopardise the scientific process. New Zealand 
expressed its continued concern about the current status of the SBT stock and recovery prospects 
and restated its view that reductions in overall catch were necessary. It also proposed that a TAC 
could be set on a three year basis; noting that stable catch levels would allow time to resolve 
scientific issues and focus Commission efforts on other important issues, including non members. 
New Zealand noted that, in the event the Commission was not able to agree on a TAC, reliance 
could be placed on the ITLOS ruling which stated that parties’ catch should be restricted to the last 
agreed level. Members agreed to make every effort to set a TAC for 2001. 
 
49. 
New Zealand advised that due to shortcomings in their administrative arrangements, the 
catch of New Zealand vessels exceeded the last agreed allocation level by 37 tonnes in 1999.  New 
Zealand advised that administrative arrangements would be revised to minimise the chance of this 
occurrence happening again.  The catch limit for 2000 would also be reduced by 37 tonnes to 
correct the situation.  
 
50. 
Japan advised that the additional catch taken in the 1999 EFP of 1487 tonnes would be 
deducted from the 2000 catch in accordance with the ITLOS order. 
 
 
Agenda Item 7: 
Other Conservation Measures 
 
51. 
Japan proposed that consideration needed to be given to measures to protect spawning fish 
on the spawning grounds. While Indonesia and Taiwan longliners operated in these waters, Japan 
considered that it would be useful to be able to monitor the catch and to determine more accurately 
their catch data, biological parameters etc.  The proposal included research to specify spawning 
area, depth, and period through the setting up of a joint scientific program with the expectancy that 
this would lead to appropriate management for the area.  
 
52. 
Australia noted that its scientific paper (CCSBT/0003/13) proposed a joint survey on these 
grounds involving Indonesia, Australia and Japan. While Japan had proposed that this be looked at 
in a mid to long-term perspective, taking account of the IOTC's port sampling program, Australia 
noted a short term window of opportunity to include Indonesia in the program. 
 
53. 
Japan noted that at CCSBT6(1), it had sought advice from Australia on action being taken 
to address reports that SBT was being taken as by-catch and discarded by Australian vessels 
operating  off the east coast of Australia.  
 
54. 
Australia clarified that those likely to catch SBT along the east coast were free to purchase 
or lease quota. Australia also noted that it would be introducing a system of rolling closures 
following the progression of migrating SBT along the east coast, from May 2000 through 
September 2000. Only fishers with 500 kilogram or more of quota could operate in the closed area 
during this time. This requirement would be lessened as SBT begin to move out from the coast. The 
location and movement of vessels along the east coast would be monitored through the requirement 
 
10 
that each boat carries an AFMA approved Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). Under Australia's 
current management arrangements for SBT any commercial fisher who takes SBT without quota 
faces heavy penalties. 
 
55. 
Australia advised that it had asked its purse seiners whether they would agree to make their 
data available to the Commission at a 1x1 degree level of detail. Correspondence by AFMA with 
industry members on this matter was tabled for the Commission’s information (CCSBT/0003/24 
and CCSBT/0003/25). Australia further advised that some support had already been received from 
industry, and it was hoped that industry as a whole would support the proposal. 
 
56. 
Japan reiterated earlier concerns with Australia’s taking of small sized fish, as this was not, 
in Japan's view, consistent with the optimal utilization objective of the Commission. Agreement 
was sought from Australia and New Zealand to review measures for reducing the taking of small 
sized fish used by other tuna commissions and to instruct the Scientific Committee to study the 
effects resulting from taking small sized fish. 
  
57. 
Australia observed that the situation in the managed SBT fishery differed considerably to 
that faced by other tuna commissions. Australia advised that the average age of Australian catch 
had increased from 2 years old to 3-4 years. This has been largely as a result of the development of 
SBT farming, which was originally developed with technical assistance from the Japanese tuna 
industry. It was also noted by Australia that recent studies indicated that the short to medium term 
effect on spawning stock of a tonne of fish of the size now being taken by Australia is likely to be 
less than a tonne of larger fish caught using long line.  
 
58. 
Japan stated that it was aware that Australia has been taking steps to ensure the catch of 
small fish was limited. However, Japan is also aware that the actual number of Australia's catch has 
been increasing. Japan also stated that, in the international community, catch of small sized fish by 
purse seiners has been a great concern, and IOTC is preparing to place restrictions on such practice. 
Japan urged that the Commission should look into the issue further and should take a step 
following the example of other organizations.

Australia indicated that there were a number of scientific theories on which age class to best 
target and that this was a subject that would be reviewed and discussed over the next couple of 
years.  In Australia’s opinion given the 1997 age distribution of SBT catches, a tonne of SBT 
caught by the Australian surface fishery results in only a small percentage change in the parental 
biomass relative to a tonne caught by the Japanese long-line fishery. The Japanese longline fishery 
harvests older and spawning individuals, so, in Australia’s view, its catches have immediate and 
medium-term impacts on the size of the parental biomass.  Consequently, in Australia’s view, the 
longline fishery has a greater impact on the estimated recruitment in the short to mid-term than the 
surface fishery. 
 
60. 
Concern was raised by Japan with a recent ruling by the Environment, Resources and 
Development Court in South Australia against further expansion of tuna farming. In particular, 
Japan inquired as to the basis to the ruling. Japan particularly asked if the basis was protection of 
marine environment, scenery of farming sites, or other reasons. Japan also inquired as to reports of 
unlicensed tuna farmers. 
 
61. 
Australia advised that the decision by the South Australian Environment, Resources and 
Development Court was based on a legal technicality.  In relation to an appeal against tuna 
farming, the Court found that "an adaptive management approach, implemented by way of licence 
 
11 
conditions to achieve ecologically sustainable development...is one means by which [tuna farming] 
development could proceed in an ecologically sustainable manner."  Further, the Court found that 
licensing under the Fisheries Act 1982 might provide for the "adaptive management approach" 
sought by the Court.  However, the Court ruled that a fish farming licence cannot be amended once 
issued and that, while the practice has been for annual licenses, the Fisheries Act enables a licence 
by the Minister to be up to ten years in length.  Thus the Court was not guaranteed an "adaptive 
management approach" would be in place. Given the lack of a guarantee, the Court said the 
precautionary principle dictated refusal of the development applications.  The South Australian 
government has since enacted legislation to ensure that this "adaptive management approach" is in 
place.  There was no question of unlicensed farmers. 
 
Agenda Item 8: 
2000 Budget 
 
62. 
Members requested the Secretariat to prepare a draft budget taking account of the decisions 
during CCSBT6(2). 
 
Agenda Item 9: 
Appointment of the Executive Secretary 
 
63. 
Members noted that the initial period of appointment of the Executive Secretary expired on 
26 January 2000 and that pending appointment of a new Executive Secretary after agreement on 
revised functions and responsibilities of the Secretariat and review of the salary level of the 
Executive Secretary, the current occupant would continue to undertake the duties of the position. 
 
64. 
Japan noted that with the agreement that a data base be established and maintained the 
expected increase in staff in the Secretariat and membership of the Commission, and the need for 
the Secretariat to attend meetings of other international organizations, the level of the position 
needed to be reviewed.  Australia agreed that the role of the Secretariat needed to be built up and 
where appropriate it should take over some of the activities now being undertaken by members. 
 
65. 
The Commission agreed to the revised duties and selection criteria for the Executive 
Secretary at Attachment O and that the position be advertised in accordance with the arrangements 
agreed by the Commission in 1996. 
 
66. 
Members also noted that Mr Mae, the Deputy Executive Secretary would be returning to 
Japan in April following the completion of his term of office in the Secretariat and that his 
replacement, Mr Kaneko, would be taking up duty in early May.  Members expressed appreciation 
for the contribution made by Mr Mae to the work of the Commission and the Secretariat.  Members 
wished him well in his new position in Japan. 
 
Agenda Item 10: 
Confidentiality of Commission Documents 
 
67. 
It was noted that this matter had been before the Commission since 1997 and that the 
current form of the proposed arrangements had been circulated in 1998 (Attachment P). Options 
were to make documents available for release unless the Commission indicated they should be 
restricted, or to restrict all documents unless there was agreement to release particular documents. 
Japan advised that it accepted the proposed arrangements circulated in 1998.  Australia indicated 
that it would like to see members reach consensus on this issue given that this item had been under 
consideration by members for some considerable time.  While acknowledging that this matter 
needed to be resolved, New Zealand advised that there was a need to ensure that the words of the 
proposal reflected the necessary confidentiality of some policy and commercially sensitive 
 
12 
information without restricting legitimate access to information about the work of the Commission. 
New Zealand supported a process whereby documents are available for release unless the 
Commission decided their dissemination should be restricted .  New Zealand provided another 
proposed draft for confidentiality provisions (attached as Annex 1). 
 
Agenda Item 11 
Other Business 
 
68. 
Members noted that the Executive Secretary had been invited to attend the 50th Anniversary 
of IATTC and the following Commission meeting and endorsed his attendance, subject to 
attendance not clashing with CCSBT requirements and any proposed statement being circulated to 
members beforehand for approval.  New Zeland noted that it would be useful for the Secretariat to 
develop a list of meetings it proposed to attend in the upcoming year, and supporting information to 
allow the Commission to make decisions in advance on an annual program rather than on an ad hoc 
basis. 
 
69. 
Japan sought advice from Australia and New Zealand on whether they would lift port access 
bans on Japanese vessels.  It is Japan’s view that it is appropriate to lift the ban in light of 
paragraph 90(1)(a) of the ITLOS order.  Japan’s particular concern was access to ports on a usual 
basis be allowed, for example, for the supply of water and treatment of illness among crew on 
fishing vessels etc. 
 
70. 
Australia and New Zealand noted Japan’s request.  Both countries advised that the matter 
could be discussed on a bilateral basis and explained that access to ports was always available for 
genuine emergencies – indeed, it was an obligation under international law to allow it – Japanese 
vessels only needed to contact the relevant authorities.  Japan stated that its request was not limited 
to emergency access. In response to the Japanese statement, Australia advised that it would contact 
Japan shortly. 
 
71. 
Australia and New Zealand also noted that the ITLOS Orders did not require that they lift 
the port access bans.  New Zealand advised that it needed to be sure that Japan had complied with, 
and would continue to comply with, the ITLOS Orders before contemplating lifting the ban. 
 
72. 
Korea requested that a list of FOC vessels circulated during the meeting by Japan be 
amended to delete 7 Korean vessels incorrectly included in the list.  Korea advised that it had 
nationalised all vessels last year and the continued inclusion of these vessels on the circulated list 
was incorrect and economically damaging for those companies.  Japan advised that the list was in 
fact an ICCAT list and noted that Korea had already written to ICCAT seeking amendments to the 
list.  Japan had asked for more information, which would be considered at the ICCAT meeting, and 
if contract parties were satisfied, the vessels would be deleted from the list. 
 
Agenda Item 12: 
Adoption of the Report 
 
73. 
The report of the meeting was adopted through correspondence out-of-session. 
 
Agenda Item 13: 
Close of Meeting 
 
74. 
The Commission agreed to adjourn the meeting.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
 
 
Australia welcomes the members of the CCSBT and the non-members to this 
important meeting of the CCSBT. 
 
I do not intend to take up a lot of time with opening remarks this morning. However, 
there are a number of issues that I would like to raise and put on the record, as there 
would appear to be some issues and misapprehension to Australia's attitude and 
current position. 
 
The first of these is port access to Japanese vessels.  Yes there are current port bans on 
Japanese vessels they were imposed as a protest to a failure to agree a TAC and later 
to the Japanese EFP.  It was a decision taken by the government of the day and the 
decision also included the removal of access for Japanese vessels to fish in the 
Australian EEZ under licence. It is incorrect to suggest that Australia in applying 
these bans in anyway that it would do so in breach of any international maritime laws 
and codes or rules that related to providing access to sick or injured seamen or to 
boats in distress.  Australia complies with all of its obligations under International 
Law in this regard. 
 
Should Watanabe –san, members of the JFA or other operators in the Japanese fleet 
have an issue or a concern with this then they are welcome to call me personally at 
anytime and I will work through the issue with them.  Australia would welcome an 
opportunity to lift these bans but in order to do so we would want an assurance of 
some co-operation and normalisation in the CCSBT and a shift in attitude away from 
unilateral experimental fishing (and I will come to this later) that have led to the bans 
and the subsequent court actions. 
 
I would welcome further discussion on this issue over the next 3 days with members 
of the JFA and industry to try to find a resolution on this issue. 
 
I will work from the agenda. 
 
Australia welcomes the presence here today of the formal delegation from Korea and 
regrets that the other parties were unable to send formal delegations to this important 
meeting.  This is an important issue for the members of the CCSBT.  We have, 
through our own restrictions and management, endeavoured to start a process of 
rebuilding this stock.  We now are disappointed to see continued erosion of our efforts 
by non-parties and FOC vessels.  This clearly can not continue. However, we 
welcome the opportunity to negotiate formally with Korea on accession. 
 
We are pleased with the progress since the last meeting on the Trade Information 
Scheme.  Australia also sees merit in the adoption of the Japanese Action Plan.  
However there are some issues that have to be finalised.  
Australia welcomes a discussion on the scheduling of future meetings of the CCSBT.  
We also suggest that now we have engaged external scientists in the CCSBT that we 
program our meetings as the other commission do in advance and that we hold only 
one CCSBT meeting each year.  Again this is consistent with the other Tuna 
Commissions.  I believe it will lead to significant improvements it will be a more 
professional commission and lead to improvements in inter-sessional activity. 
 
We are pleased that there has been some initial agreement on the arrangements for 
data management in the CCSBT Secretariat and agree that this should assist with the 
role of the external scientists and also assist the in country scientists. 
 
Australia is pleased to see that the members of the CCSBT have agreed on the 
external chairs and members for the SC/SAG and the Advisory Panel.  They are an 
impressive group of scientific advisers to the CCSBT and I note that this is their role. 
 
Australia apologises for our inability to provide members with our paper on proposals 
for Scientific Research (SR).  This we see as the most appropriate way to move 
forward on this issues as it provide a holistic and balanced perspective on the need for 
future research that attempts to target the major uncertainties in the fishery. 
 
As we have not circulated this paper in advance and in line with the suggestions and 
requests of the parties at the last meeting to table papers for discussion at least 2 
weeks in advance of the meeting, we accept and understand that this paper will not be 
discussed at this meeting.  However, we will table it today and would welcome any 
thoughts on the concept prior to the next meeting. 
 
On the issue of the EFP we note that it is again on the agenda and we note our 
comments made at the last meeting. Australia has stated, and this is reflected in the 
development of the SR paper that we are prepared to discuss the broad issue of SR 
that addresses key uncertainties in an overall program of approved research supported 
by the parties and the externals.  This program might have a mix of elements and this 
might include a small, well-designed and scientifically valid EFP.  However, the 
parties and the externals will need to weigh up the costs and benefits of that type of 
research against other important research areas that we could address.  
 
Australia considers that all future attempts and proposals for scientific research must 
be rigorously evaluated and be shown to have scientific merit.  Our firm view remains 
that the last two EFPs conducted unilaterally by Japan did not meet this criteria  
 
There is clearly a range of important areas that the parties must focus their efforts to 
improve the functioning of the CCSBT.  Australia believes that the SBT and the 
parties are best served through a fully functioning CCSBT and intends to put its effort 
for the next year into incorporating the external scientists in to the CCSBT, engaging 
the non-parties and in rebuilding the trust and co-operation within the CCSBT.  This 
will assist all parties in giving effect to their obligations under international law 
including UNCLOS and the 1993 Convention. 
 
Australia has instituted a number of recent initiatives to improve our data collection 
and management of or SBT take and we believe we now have the most transparent 
process of any of the members.  However we have and will continue to improve as 
technology and information systems develop and we welcome the commitment of the 
other members and non-members to this end. 
 
I look forward to a positive and progressive meeting of the parties and please enjoy 
our fair city of Canberra.

Opening Statement of Japan 
 
 
1. 
Japan, Australia, and New Zealand have been continuously discussing ways to 
realize the conservation and optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna through the 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT).  As a result, the 
three countries have been successful to some extent in collecting various types of 
information, including biological parameters, on southern bluefin tuna. However, with 
respect to the stock assessment of southern bluefin tuna that constitutes the basis of 
conservation and optimum utilisation, no unified view has been achieved yet among the 
Parties. While this issue remains unresolved, catches by non-Party countries and entities 
have increased rapidly, further aggravating the situation surrounding the stock of 
southern bluefin tuna. 
 
2. 
In the future, it is necessary to promote further cooperation not only among Parties 
but also with non-Party countries and entities for the future development of the CCSBT 
along the following two major lines:  (1) normalization of the scientific process; and 
(2) taking measures to promote cooperation with the CCSBT by non-Party countries and 
entities. 
 
3. 
I am happy to note that, at the CCSBT6 meeting last year, and at the Peer Review 
Workshop held immediately prior to that meeting, the Parties made outstanding progress, 
surpassing what had been achieved in previous years.  The Parties agreed on the 
following three points: 
 
(1) Implementing a “trade information scheme” from June 1 this year; 
 
(2) Establishing an “Advisory Panel” consisting of external scientists which is 
empowered to give its own recommendations in case differences of opinions persist in 
the Scientific Committee over stock assessment and other issues, and appointing 
independent chairmen of the Scientific Committee and the Stock Assessment Group; 
and 
 
(3) Organizing a workshop designed to unify and simplify the stock assessment 
procedures (Stock Assessment Procedure Workshop). 
 
Furthermore, at CCSBT6 last year, mutual understanding between the Parties and 
Republic of Korea/Taiwan was improved as a result of candid exchanges of views. In 
the meeting, the Parties also reached the consensus to address expeditiously the “action 
plan” proposed by Japan, which includes trade-related measures against 
non-cooperative non-Party countries and entities, with a view toward the CCSBT’s 
adopting the action plan. 
 
4. 
Japan hopes that the resumed CCSBT6 will be fruitful and will not lose the 
momentum achieved last year toward improving the functioning of the CCSBT. 
 
5. 
(Normalization of the scientific process) 
 
The Parties have already achieved consensus on independent chairmen of the 
Scientific Committee and the Stock Assessment Group as well as members of the 
Advisory Panel. It is essential to make efficient use of the independent chairmanship 
and the panel in the years ahead. 
 
Japan believes that work regarding the Stock Assessment Process Workshop should 
be advanced on a priority basis. For this reason, this Workshop should be constituted so 
that it can be convened as early as possible with the participation of the Advisory Panel 
and independent chairmen, and the integration and simplification of stock assessment 
procedures can be advanced in an efficient manner. 
 
With a view to advancing the normalization of the scientific process and ensuring 
objectivity and transparency in stock assessment, the Secretariat should be given the 
function of collecting and managing data, equivalent to the level of other regional 
fisheries management organizations related to tuna.  Further, as recommended by the 
Peer Review Report and Peer Review Workshop, efforts should be made to have 
positive cooperation with and objective advice from other fisheries management 
organizations, such as the IOTC and ICCAT. 
 
6. 
(Measures to enhance cooperation with non-Party countries and entities) 
 
It is the hope of the Government of Japan that measures to promote cooperation 
with non-Party countries and entities will be further strengthened, with cooperation 
from Australia and New Zealand. 
 
With respect to the Republic of Korea, it is truly regrettable that negotiations have 
not been finalized regarding its allocation. The Republic of Korea has increased its 
catch without restriction while Japanese fishermen have operated within restrictive 
national allocations throughout the past decade.  Such development is unreasonable 
and unacceptable. Cooperation by the Republic of Korea is critical to the strengthening 
of the CCSBT’s functioning. We would like to urge the Republic of Korea to act 
flexibly in accepting a national allocation of 1,000 tons, which had been presented as an 
acceptable level by the Republic of Korea on more than one occasion during the period 
between 1998 to March 1999. 
 
Japan hopes that Taiwan will be an active member of the CCSBT. With respect to 
the form of participation of Taiwan in the CCSBT, a constructive exchange of views 
took place concerning realistic solutions to this issue at the meeting of Head of 
delegates at the previous meeting. Japan hopes that this issue will be resolved at this 
meeting. In any case, Japan strongly hopes that Taiwan will voluntarily respect 
obligations stipulated under the Convention and will restrain its catch to the level 
suggested by the CCSBT. 
 
Japan considers it crucial to adopt the “Action Plan” which Japan proposed at the 
previous meeting to enhance cooperation with non-Part countries and entities. The plan 
is modeled on a similar action plan adopted in 1994 at ICCAT (of which the United 
States and the European Community are among the members), which was designed to 
ensure consistency with the provisions of the World Trade Organization Agreement. 
 
We expect that the trade information scheme will promptly become effective in 
light of the decision at the previous meeting, and that implementation would be 
effective from June 1, 2000. 
 
7. 
(TAC/EFP) 
 
Total allowable catch (TAC) should be established taking into account the 
allocations for all Parties and non-Party countries and entities. In view of the CCSBT’s 
inability to decide on TAC on the basis of stock assessment to date, Japan believes it is 
necessary that the scientific process be normalized by establishing a time-frame so that 
TAC can be established as soon as possible. 
 
To advance the normalization of the scientific process, Japan hopes to present and 
discuss a plan for a Joint EFP for 2000–2001 to a Working Group established 
specifically for this purpose, in accordance with the agreement at last year’s EFP 
Working Group on a three-year (1999-2001) scope for an EFP.  Taking into account 
Australia and New Zealand’s positions to achieve a consensus and in the spirit of 
cooperation, Japan proposes that an maximum catch of 1,500mt each year for the Joint 
EFP, which starts in 2000 and ends in 2001 be established, and that, in case the 
maximum catch is exceeded because of unavoidable factors such as scientific 
requirements, the excess be deducted from the subsequent year’s national allocations for 
Parties who participate in the Joint EFP.  In deducting such amount, the catch ratio of 
participating vessels will be the most important criterion. 
 
8. 
(The issue of port access) 
 
  
Port access is crucial for the supplying of water and treatment of illness among 
crews on fishing vessels. Japan believes Australia/New Zealand should lift, from a 
humanitarian viewpoint, their measures prohibiting call at their ports by Japanese tuna 
longline fishing vessels. 
 
9.  Finally, the Japanese delegation is committed to do its utmost to bring success to 
the present meeting, and hopes that discussion at this meeting will result in the further 
strengthening of cooperative relations among the Parties as well as the functioning of 
the CCSBT. 
 
  
Attachment E 
 
Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Good morning and greetings to the delegations from Australia and Japan.  The 
attendance of an observer from South Africa is appreciated and we extend a particular 
welcome to the representatives from Taiwan and Korea. 
 
I will keep my opening comments brief recognising this is a resumed session of the 
Commissions 6th meeting.  The parties have a solid foundation in respect of our 
commitment to sustainable harvest of SBT and the large measure of agreement we 
have on fundamental issues.  This meeting provides an opportunity to find further 
common ground to enable progress on the key issues facing our Commission. 
 
Although we are conscious of the rulings and instructions from ITLOS and the next 
legal steps, our intent at this meeting is to work with the other delegations to confirm 
mechanisms to have this Commission function effectively without intervention.  
For New Zealand our fundamental drive is to take the remaining steps to re-establish 
an effectively functioning Commission, and our assessment is that recent discussions 
have resulted in considerable progress toward this objective. 
 
Because of the constrained timeframe for this two day Commission meeting we will 
need to work effectively, with the assistance of the Chair, to ensure that we have 
useful outcomes to report. 
 
At this meeting, we should use the attendance of representatives from Korea and 
Taiwan to expeditiously move negotiations on the remaining steps toward achieving 
their commitment to the responsibilities and obligations of participation in the 
Commission.  The Commission also needs to confirm the implementation of a trade 
information scheme and consider the subsequent implementation of measures to 
address any unwillingness to cooperate with the management arrangements of the 
Commission.  Ultimately these mechanisms will not only ensure we obtain the data 
critical for assessment and management but will provide the incentives to encourage 
cooperation with the Commission by others fishing for SBT. 
 
The members have agreed in principle on the mechanisms we intend to employ to 
resolve issues in the stock assessment and the scientific process used by the 
Commission.  We need to endorse the outcomes agreed at the two working group 
meetings and implement a cost effective process to provide us with the assessment 
advice that is central to judicious management decisions.  These improvements to the 
scientific process are central to allowing the agreed recovery targets to be reached 
through an improved management strategy and consequent improved procedures to 
set TACs. 
 
As a result of recent events, the international community will closely examine the 
steps this Commission takes to resolve our differences and make progress on critical 
issues.  We intend to make every reasonable effort to confirm progress at this meeting 
by applying flexibility and constructive compromise to find further areas of consensus 
between the three parties to the Commission. 
 
Attachment F  
 
 
 
Opening Statement by the Republic of Korea 
 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, and ladies and gentlemen, 
 
 
Korean delegation is delighted to attend the second part of the sixth CCSBT meeting. 
I would like to extend my appreciation to the members and secretariat for inviting my 
delegation. 
 
 
On resuming our attendance to this meeting, my delegation is obliged to get reminded 
of the disappointing outcomes of the last November meeting in that our strenuous 
efforts to be a member of CCSBT was not rewarded as expected. However, we are 
pleased to note that during the inter-sessional period leading up to this meeting, 
dialogue between my government and CCSBT has been conducted through exchange 
of letters and more recently through exchange of senior-officials with Japan. We 
appreciate the secretariat's role in facilitation this dialogue. 
 
 
My delegation is mindful of vigorous agenda that needs to be addressed in the next 
three days. So, we remain committed to our active engagement in the discussions of 
the agenda as well as continued negotiations for Korea's accession. In that context, 
let me lay out a few thoughts on a few issues of particular interest to my delegation. 
 
 
As the starter, my delegation believes that the responsibility for the management and 
conservation of the SBT stocks falls commonly on all countries concerned regardless 
of its membership. It is in the interest of the CCSBT to ensure that major fishing 
countries are incorporated under its framework as early as possible. To that end, it is 
important that CCSBT and non-members can work out a fair and mutually 
satisfactory quota level, taking into account the respective socio-economic 
circumstances of each non-member. 
 
 
Regarding the proposed action plan, my delegation believes that this proposal is 
counter-productive, particularly when it is applied to Korea. Considering Korea's 
active cooperation with commission's efforts for the conservation and management of 
SBT and Korea's track record of having been a responsible fishing country, the trade 
restrictive measures contained in the proposed action plan will only undermine the  
on-going negotiations between Korea and CCSBT. My delegation has strong 
reservation to any proposal which does not take fair account of Korea's sincere 
commitment to the commission's work. 
 
 
 
 
Regarding the Trade Information Scheme, my delegation wishes to reiterate its 
willingness to fully cooperate in implementing the scheme as scheduled. In line with 
that, my delegation will register seals and signatures of Korea's national validation 
authorities at the secretariat during this meeting. 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, 
On the issue of Korea's accession, Korea has expressed her firm intention to join the 
CCSBT since 1996. Since that time on,. Korea has continuously participated in the 
commission meetings as well as scientific committee meetings; provided scientific 
information and statistics on a regular basis; withdrew longliners voluntarily from the 
convention area in 1999; and implemented annual catch limits at 1,600MT  
Furthermore, Korea has no more FOC vessels engaged in tuna longline fishery as of 
November 1999. 
 
 
Au such, Korea shares with the members of the same goal of ensuring the 
conservation and optimum utilisation of SBT. 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, 
As our task ahead is challenging, it is all the more important that discussions in this 
meeting are conducted in an efficient and constructive manner. My delegation assure 
you of our full support to you. We are hopeful that under your competent 
chairmanship, this meeting will be able to lead to a mutually satisfactory conclusion 
of Korea's accession to the commission,. which has already been long overdue. 
 
 
Thank you.

South African Opening Statement to Sixth Annual CCSBT Meeting 
 
 
 
Mr. Chairman and Distinguished Delegates, 
 
It is again an honour for South Africa to be invited as an observer to this, the Sixth 
Annual Commission Meeting of Parties to the Convention for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna.  As you are aware, South Africa has considerable interest in 
the work of this Commission and its exemplary efforts aimed at conserving an 
extremely important and valuable resource. 
 
Like all present here, South Africa is committed to responsible fishing to ensure the 
sustainable utilisation of the Ocean's bounty.  As a developing country, we are deeply 
concerned by the current explosion of Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported fishing 
worldwide.  Not only does this challenge those nations who fish responsibly; it also 
makes the work of Commissions such as this much harder. 
 
Following the above, South Africa is indeed willing to so all in its power to ensure the 
sustainable utilisation of Southern Bluefin Tuna is promoted and realised.  We offer 
our services wherever and whenever they may be required to ensure that this goal is 
the South African Government, despite very limited fiscal and human resources, is 
reviewing its position on acceding to the Convention for the Conservation of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna. 
 
I thank you all for this opportunity to speak. 
 
Thank you Mr. Chairman. 
 
Attachment H 
 
 
Opening Statement by Taiwan 
 
 
 
I would like to say thanks to the CCSBT for inviting us to take part in this 
meeting. 
 
 
As a tuna fishing country, we see the importance of conservation and 
management of tuna resources for the sustainable utilization.  We also see that in 
order to achieve this goal, the common efforts among all countries concerned are 
essential. 
 
 
For the purpose of the conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, we value the 
resolution made by the CCSBT in 1995, a voluntary measure of limiting annual catch 
of Southern Bluefin Tuna at 1,450 MT has been imposed in Taiwan by my 
government since 1996. We have done very hard in Taiwan to implement such 
measure, and the result was satisfied. We have submitted a report of  “ Review of 
Taiwan SBT Fishery of 1998/99 ” to the Secretariat of CCSBT. 
 
 
We also dispatch scientists to take care of the research on Southern Bluefin 
Tuna’s conservation and the incidental catch of seabirds. We have issued the 
brochures that guide our fishermen how to prevent incidental catch of seabirds. 
 
 
Also I would like to mention that the Agriculture Council of Taiwan has 
decided to implement “  the Trade Information Scheme ” from June 01 of this year. 
And the related regulations have been already announced on March 3. 
 
 
I would like to repeat that we value what CCSBT has done to the conservation 
of Bluefin Tuna. For the same purpose, even Taiwan is not a party to the CCSBT, we 
do have made quite a lot of efforts for the conservation of tuna. We believe that these 
efforts made by us should be recognized and appreciated by all parties involved in 
fishing for SBT. 
 
 
As one of major fishing nations in the world, we are highly concerned the 
conservation and management of tuna resources. Therefore we like to express our 
willingness to continue to to work together with all parties of CCSBT to achieve the 
goal of the sustainable utilization of the valuable Bluefin Tuna. 
 
 
Finally, I say thanks again for the invitation. Also we express our gratitude for 
the hospitality extended by the hosting countries-Austrlia. 
Attachment I 
 
ACTION PLAN 
 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (the Commission), 
 
RECALLING that the objective of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna (the Convention) is to ensure the conservation and optimum utilisation of 
southern bluefin tuna (SBT); 
 
AWARE that a significant number of vessels registered to non-Parties to the 
Convention are catching SBT; 
 
CONVINCED of the need for urgent action to ensure the effectiveness of the 
conservation measures for SBT in force from time to time; 
 
AWARE of the strenuous efforts by Parties to encourage non-Parties to accede to the 
Convention or cooperate with the Commission; 
 
RECALLING that under Article 15(4) of the Convention Parties are obliged to 
cooperate in taking appropriate action to deter non-Party fishing which could adversely 
affect the objective of the Convention, 
 
resolves as follows: 
 
1. 
The Commission requests non-Members catching SBT to cooperate fully with the 
Commission in implementing the measures applicable to Members for conservation, 
management and optimum utilisation of SBT (hereinafter referred to as 
“conservation and management measures”).  The Commission also requests those 
non-Members to advise it of their actions taken in that regard. 
 
2. 
The Commission will identify, at or before the Seventh, and then at each 
subsequent Annual Meeting of the Commission, those non-Members whose vessels 
have been catching SBT in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of the 
conservation and management measures, based on the catch data compiled by the 
Commission, trade information and other relevant information obtained in ports 
and on fishing grounds. 
 
3. 
The Chair of the Commission shall request those non-Members identified pursuant 
to paragraph 2 to rectify their fishing activities so as not to diminish the 
effectiveness of the conservation and management measures and to advise the 
Commission of their actions taken in that regard. 
 
4. 
Members shall jointly and/or individually request non-Members catching SBT to 
cooperate fully with the Commission in implementing the conservation and 
management measures.

Attachment J 
 
CCSBT 
Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document Program 
 
 
 
1. Principle/General 
 
1.1 For importation into the territory of a Member, all southern bluefin tuna shall be 
accompanied by a CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document. There is no 
waiver of this requirement. 
 
1.2 Implementation of this Program shall be in conformity with relevant international 
obligations. 
 
1.3 The Commission will review the implementation of this Program periodically in a 
timely manner to ensure the effectiveness and practicability of this Program. 
 
1.4 The Commission requests the appropriate authorities of exporting countries/fishing 
entities to make the requirements under this Program known to their exporters. 
 
2. Information Required 
 
2.1 A standard CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document form along with its 
Instruction Sheet is at Annex 1. Countries/Fishing Entities are requested to use this 
form. While minimal modifications such as addition of translations may be made, 
the standard form should be adopted as far as possible and no information item may 
be omitted from the standard form. 
 
2.2 The import of farmed tuna should be treated in the following way: 
 
(a) The Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document shall be validated by the 
authority of the country/fishing entity where the tuna was raised; 
 
(b) In reporting import data collected by the Program under 5.2 to Members, the 
Executive Secretary shall record the amount of imported farmed fish separately 
from the rest of the imports for each country/fishing entity; 
 
(c) When completing the CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document for 
farmed tuna, the name of the export country/fishing entity shall be indicated in 
item 1 of Export Section of each Document instead of “Flag Country/Fishing 
Entity of Capture Vessel”, and the name of the Tuna Farm shall be indicated in 
item 2 of Export Section of each Document instead of “Name of Vessel and 
Registration Number”; for item 6 (Description of Fish) of Export Section of 
each Document, “Gear Code” shall be “Farmed”, “Net Weight” shall be filled in 
with the raised products’ weight, and “Time of Harvest” and “Area of Catch” 
are not necessary to be filled in while other columns shall be filled in as in the 
case of the normal Document; 
 
(d) Members shall maintain aggregated information on their tuna farms which raise 
exported tuna. The following information will be recorded: the name of the 
fishing vessel which caught the tuna for farming, the flag country/fishing entity 
of that fishing vessel, the gear code, the amount of original catch, the area of 
catch, the date of reception of tuna, and growth rate and mortality rate of fish 
through farming. 
 
(e) Members shall submit such information to the Secretariat every six months on 
average. Urgent requests for information outside this framework should be 
substantiated to the Commission by the requesting Member in order to 
minimise the burden of such requests. 
 
3. Validation 
 
3.1 The CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document shall be validated, in 
principle, by an official of the flag country/fishing entity of the vessel that harvested 
the tuna. 
 
3.2 The requirement for validation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document 
by an official under 3.1 with respect to any member of the Commission may be met 
by an entity duly delegated by the authority of the flag country/fishing entity. The 
Member which utilizes a delegated entity should submit a certified copy of such 
delegation to the Executive Secretary. 
 
4. Exchange of Information 
 
4.1 If a Member modifies the standard Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document 
form for its use, it shall provide to the Executive Secretary a copy of such modified 
form. The Executive Secretary shall provide the modified form to other Members 
and non-Members fishing and exporting southern bluefin tuna to Members. 
 
4.2 Each Member shall provide to the Executive Secretary information on validation 
(e.g. type of validation, name of the organization which validates the documents, 
title of officials who validate the documents, sample impression of stamp or seal) 
and inform him of any change in a timely fashion. The Executive Secretary shall 
request information on validation from all non-Members fishing and exporting 
southern bluefin tuna to Members, and request them to inform him in a timely 
fashion of any change in the information provided. 
 
4.3 The Executive Secretary shall maintain and update information specified in 4.1 and 
4.2, and provide it to all Members and promptly circulate any changes. 
 
5. Record and Report 
 
5.1 Members which import southern bluefin tuna shall retain all original Southern 
Bluefin Tuna Statistical Documents received by them. They shall forward to the 
Executive Secretary on a quarterly basis copies of all such Documents, but may 
omit the Import Section other than the final point of import and the date of import. 
The Executive Secretary shall compile the raw data from those Documents into an 
electronic database. 
 
5.2 The Executive Secretary shall ensure the confidentiality of the raw data in its 
database and release to any country/fishing entity only the raw data relating to the 
Statistical Documents it validated. If a country/fishing entity requests raw data 
relating to another country/fishing entity, the Executive Secretary may release those 
data only with the latter’s agreement. 
 
5.3 The Executive Secretary shall report to the Commission on and circulate to all Members 
the data collected by the Program each year by 1 April for the period of 1 July - 31 
December of the preceding year and by 1 October for the period of 1 January - 30 June 
of the current year. The format of the report is attached as Annex 2. The Executive 
Secretariat shall provide an electronic copy of the report to a designated authority of each 
Member. 
 
5.4 On request by the Scientific Committee or another subsidiary body of the 
Commission, the Executive Secretary shall, with the approval of the Commission, 
provide to that body data collected by the Program more frequently or at a greater 
level of detail than specified in 5.3. 
 
5.5 Upon receiving the import data mentioned in 5.3, Members that export SBT shall 
check their export statistics against them and report the results to the Commission.  
Where necessary, an exporting Member may obtain from the Secretariat a copy of 
any Statistical Document it validated, as forwarded to the Secretariat by the 
importing Member in accordance with 5.1.  
 
5.6 The Commission instructs the Executive Secretary to request non-Members which 
are major importing countries/fishing entities of southern bluefin tuna to cooperate 
with implementation of the Program and to provide to the Commission data 
obtained from such implementation. 
 
6. Re-export 
 
6.1 A Member may validate a CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Re-export Certificate (a 
standard form is attached as Annex 3) for southern bluefin tuna imported by that 
Member, to which a CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document or 
CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Re-export Certificate is attached. The CCSBT 
Southern Bluefin Tuna Re-export Certificate shall be validated by an official or by 
an entity duly delegated by the authority of a Member to validate the CCSBT 
Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document under 3.2. A copy of the original 
Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document accompanying the imported southern 
bluefin tuna must be attached to CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Re-export 
Certificate. The copy of original Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document so 
attached must be verified by that official or by that entity duly delegated by the 
authority of a Member which validate the CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical 
Document. When re-exported southern bluefin tuna is again re-exported, all copies 
of documents, including verified copy of a Statistical Document and Re-export 
Certificate which accompanied that southern bluefin tuna upon importation, must be 
attached to a new Re-export Certificate to be validated by a re-exporting Member. 
All copies of the Documents to be attached to that new Re-export Certificate must 
also be verified by an official or an entity duly delegated by the authority of a 
Member which validated the CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document. 
 
6.2 Members which import southern bluefin tuna shall accept the Re-export Certificate 
set forth in 6.1 with attachments of all verified copies as required in 6.1. 
 
6.3 Members that validate a Re-export Certificate in accordance with the procedure set 
forth in 6.1 shall require from the re-exporting southern bluefin tuna dealer 
necessary documents (e.g. written sales contracts) which are to certify that the 
southern bluefin tuna to be re-exported corresponds to the imported southern bluefin 
tuna. Members which validate a Re-export Certificate shall provide the flag 
country/fishing entity and importing country with evidence of this correspondence 
upon their request. 
 
6.4 The Executive Secretary shall report on and circulate to all Members the data 
obtained from Re-export Certificates each year by 1 April for the period of 1 July - 
31 December of the preceding year and by 1 October for the period of 1 January - 
30 June of the current year. The format of the report is attached as Annex 4. 
 
6.5 Members may accept a Re-export Certificate validated by a non-Member which has 
established a scheme substantially identical to the CCSBT Southern Bluefin Tuna 
Statistical Document Program and implements it in accordance with the 
requirements of the Program. 
 
6.6 The provisions of 5.1 and 5.2 apply also to any Re-export Certificate required to be 
attached to a Southern Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document.

Attachment K 
 
Terms of Reference for a Database and Database Manager for the CCSBT 
Secretariat (Version 5, 25 July 2000) 
 
1. At the resumed Sixth Annual Meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna, it was decided that the Secretariat will maintain a database 
for the purposes of information exchange with other regional fisheries 
management organisations, provision of fisheries data for stock assessments to 
both Member and external scientists, monitoring the Commission’s Trade 
Information Scheme and provision of information to the public. 
 
2. The database format and requirements of the Commission shall be reviewed on a 
regular basis and with consideration of future stock assessment and other needs. 
 
3. The database will comprise data on 1) catch, size and effort by area for stock 
assessment, 2) annual catch by country and gear and 3) trade statistics. Data 
formats are defined in Attachment A. 
 
4. Data on tuna species other than southern bluefin tuna and other by-catch species, 
and other information required for the SBT stock assessment will be incorporated 
in the database if determined by the Commission in consultation with the 
Scientific Committee and Ecologically Related Species Working Group. 
 
5. The principal duties of the Secretariat in relation to the database are : 
i. 
Create and maintain the database; 
ii. 
Facilitate submission of data from Parties and non-parties  
                        within a time frame established by the CCSBT; 
iii. 
Inform the CCSBT Members if, data are not provided following       
                        the agreed formats or within the agreed time frames; 
iv. 
Extract and reconfigure fishery data for use in the stock 
assessment following to the instructions from both Members 
and external scientists; 
v. 
Provide data extracts and products in approved formats for   
                        public release, exchange with other fisheries organizations and  
                        approved research; and, 
vi. 
Handle requests for full database access in accordance with an 
                        agreed procedure and confidentiality requirements. 
6.  The Secretariat, in consultation with the Scientific Committee and the 
Commission, will employ a database manager with expertise in database 
management, experience in fisheries statistics and knowledge of data 
requirements and processes involved in fisheries stock assessments. The 
database manager will maintain the database at the Secretariat, ensure effective 
communication on data issues among Members and the Secretariat, develop data 
products for distribution to Members, non-members, the public and other and 
liaise with the Stock Assessment Group and Scientific Committee. The data 
manager will meet requests from the Scientific Committee, Stock Assessment 
Group, fishery organizations and external scientists for data extracts and 
reconfigurations for stock assessment purposes. 
 
7. The Secretariat will ensure that the data confidentiality requirements established 
by the Commission are adhered to. Data confidentiality requirements are detailed 
in Attachment B. 
 
8. The Secretariat will ensure secure access to the database in accordance with 
generally accepted standards in the computing industry. 
 
9. The Secretariat will produce database products in both printed and electronic 
form and at the appropriate level of aggregation, as defined in Attachment B, for 
distribution to other regional fisheries organisations and the public. 
10. The Secretariat will include in the database appropriate information that it is able 
to compile on non-member catch, effort and size. The Secretariat will consult 
with the Scientific Committee and the Commission on the data to be included. 
 
Attachment A 
Database format for data maintained at the Secretariat of the CCSBT 
1. 
Catch and effort by Area  
Monthly catch (by number and weight) and effort by 1 x 1 degree for the 
surface fishery and 5 x 5 degree for longline  [Format: method 
(LL/PS/PL/ML), year, month, country/party, area of aggregation, effort, effort 
unit, species, whole weight of retained fish, conversion factor, number of fish 
retained, raising factor and basis, and number of  non-retained fish].(where 
possible) 
2. 
Catch by Country 
Annual (calendar and quota year) adjusted catches (by weight) for each 
country, with corresponding quota year dates for CCSBT members. All 
adjustment factors assumed should be noted with the data. [Format: Year, 
country/party, gear, calendar year total SBT catch in weight and number, quota 
year, start and end date of quota year, and quota year total SBT catch in weight 
and number, number of active boats]. 
3. 
Size data by Country and Area 
A detailed format for the size data needs to be developed. The data need to 
include the information required to estimate the size composition of the total 
catch (eg. size of fish measured, number of fish measured, coverage, weighting 
factors, etc.). In the interim, the database should at least accommodate the size 
data that have been exchanged among the Parties in the past.  
 
4. 
Trade statistics (NOTE: DATA REQUIREMENT TO BE CONFIRMED BY TIS 
WORKING GROUP) 
Import and export information shall be available through the Trade 
Information Scheme, although the reliability of historical data will be variable. 
Information will be provided to identify potential weaknesses in historical 
data. [Historical data format when possible: year, month, country/party, source, 
importing party, exporting party, type of product, amount of product, other 
information. Current export format 1: document number, captured or farmed, 
flag country/entity/fishing entity of capture vessel, name of vessel and 
registration number, information on other forms of capture, processing 
establishment name and address, point of export. Current export format 2: 
document number, product (F/FR), product type (RD/GG/FL/OT), product 
type if OT, time of harvest (mm/yy), gear code, gear type is OT, Statistical 
Area of catch, net weight (kg), number of fish. Current import format: period 
from (mm/yy) to (mm/yy), import country, export flag county/entity/fishing 
entity, area code, time of harvest, gear code, gear type if OT, point of export, 
product, type, product type if OT, product weight, number of fish. Current re-
export format1 and 2 as per Trade Certification Scheme documents]. 
 
Attachment B 
Data Confidentiality 
Confidentiality required by the data source and providers must be respected for all 
data submitted to the CCSBT Secretariat. Policies and procedures to ensure 
confidentiality will include:  
• The data held by the Commission will be available to the scientists involved in the 
Stock Assessment Group and Scientific Committee under the condition that the 
data are used only for stock assessment of southern bluefin tuna and that they shall 
not release or publish confidential data. 
• The level of aggregation for public release of the catch-and-effort data for 
southern bluefin tuna shall be 1 x 1 for the surface fishery and 5 x 5 for the 
longline fishery and weighted length-frequency data (aggregated by 5 x 10 degree 
squares (LL) or Australian Fishing Area (surface fishery), unless the identity of an 
individual vessel can be determined within area and time strata. Where an 
individual vessel can be identified within a particular area and time, the data will 
be further aggregated by area or time to preclude identification. Individual party’s 
confidentiality guidelines shall apply when necessary. 
• The detailed trade information data submitted to the Secretariat database shall be 
available only to those that submitted data and those that exported fish covered by 
the data.  The level of aggregation for the trade information data for public release 
data will be at the half-yearly level. 
• The Secretariat shall be responsible for making the aggregated summaries of all 
data comply with the confidentiality requirements mentioned above.  
• Databases will be protected through passwords and appropriate security 
arrangements. 
• Access to the confidential data in the database maintained at the Secretariat may 
be granted to outside individuals only after written authorisation is obtained from

Japanese Proposal for Joint Experimental Fishing Program 
 
1. There exists considerable discrepancy among the Parties with respect to the current stock 
status of SBT. This is because there is increase in areas and seasons that are currently 
unfished, and thus stock assessment must rely on hypotheses concerning abundance in 
these areas and seasons.   
2. In order to resolve such situation, Japan shall endeavor to improve the current stock 
assessment procedures through the Stock Assessment Process Workshop in which the 
Advisory Panel will also participate.  Concurrently, Japan also firmly believes that the 
gathering of scientific information that is currently lacking is indispensable. 
3. Based on previous discussions among the Parties concerning EFPs and in light of the 
expertise gained through implementing the 1998 and 1999 EFPs, Japan hereby proposes 
that the three Parties reach consensus with respect to conducting a Joint EFP as outlined 
below: 
(1) A working group should be created to establish a Joint EFP with the 
participation of independent scientists as well as Japan, Australia, and New 
Zealand; 
(2) Based on the consensus among Japan, Australia, and New Zealand at last year’s 
EFP Working Group on a three-year (1999-2001) duration for the EFP, the Joint 
EFP should end in 2001, provided that (a) the data from the 1998 and1999 EFP 
should be properly incorporated together with the data from the 2000 and 2001 
Joint EFPs into the overall stock assessment analysis, and (b) an EFP of 
appropriate substance shall be carried out during 2000 as well as 2001. 
(3) The working group should promptly begin a discussion of the Joint EFP, so that 
the Joint EFP may commence by August 2000 at the latest.   
(4) In order to gather scientifically valid and statistically significant data, the Joint 
EFP design ideally should not determine the ceiling on the resulting catch level, 
because an EFP design first needs to set the number of operations required 
depending on the season and area to be surveyed.  Japan believes that a 
reasonable EFP at a level previously proposed by Japan would not adversely 
affect the SBT stock in this regard.  However, taking into account Australia’s 
and New Zealand’s positions, Japan proposes, to achieve a consensus and in the 
spirit of cooperation, that the maximum catch for this Joint EFP, encompassing 
CPUE research and a feasibility tagging survey conducted in conjunction with 
the CPUE component, be set at the level of 1500 tons each year of the 2000-
2001 EFP, regardless of the area and season during which it is to be conducted.  
In order to establish continuity with the data gathered in the 1998 and 1999 EFPs, 
Japan is prepared to have Japanese vessels entirely carry out this CPUE and 
 
tagging survey, despite the expected financial losses.  However, recognizing that 
the actual catch may unavoidably exceed the maximum catch level set in order 
to adhere to the EFP design and ensure the reliability of the resulting data, Japan 
proposes that any excess above the maximum catch level would be deducted 
from the subsequent year’s national allocations for Parties who participate in the 
Joint EFP.  In deducting such amount, the catch ratio of participating vessels will 
be the most important criterion.  
4. 
Japan welcomes the comments of the other Parties concerning this initial proposal and 
is prepared to take such comments into account in formulating a revised proposal. 
 
5. 
This paper is presented without prejudice to Japan’s legal position.
