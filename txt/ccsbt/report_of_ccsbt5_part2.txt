Report of the Fifth Annual Meeting 
Second Part 
10 - 13 May 1999 
Tokyo, Japan 
 
 
Representatives of the Governments of Australia, Japan and New Zealand met in Tokyo 
from 10 to 13 May 1999 for the Resumed Fifth Annual Meeting of the Commission for 
the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (‘CCSBT5(2)’).  
 
Agenda Item 1: Opening of Meeting 
 
Mr Yasuo Takase, the chair of the Commission, welcomed the delegations from 
Member countries and observers from the Republic of Indonesia, the Republic of 
Korea, the Republic of South Africa and Taiwan. Mr Kenji Kagawa from Japan was 
identified as the observer from the Commission for the Conservation for Antarctic 
Marine Living Resources (‘CCAMLR’). The list of participants at CCSBT5(2) is 
contained in Attachment A. 
 
Australia and New Zealand welcomed Mr Kaminokado as the head of the Japanese 
delegation following the retirement of Mr Ishida. 
 
1.1 Adoption of the Agenda 
 
Japan proposed that a new item on “CITES” be added to Agenda Item 10. The meeting 
adopted the agenda as amended (Attachment B). The list of documents tabled at 
CCSBT5(2) forms Attachment C. 
 
1.2 Appointment of Rapporteurs  
 
The Secretariat undertook the role of rapporteur. 
 
Opening Statements 
 
Australia, Japan and New Zealand presented their opening statements. All Parties noted 
that a number of important issues would need to be resolved at CCSBT5(2), including 
seeking to reach agreement on an experimental fishing program, progressing 
arrangements for the accession of non-Parties to the Convention and stabilisation of the 
Commission's work program. All Parties indicated a desire to work cooperatively to 
reach agreement on the issues before the Commission. 
 
Agenda Item 2: Experimental Fishing Program 
 
The Chair of the Joint Experimental Fishing Program Working Group (‘EFPWG’), 
Dr Annala, summarised the work of the EFPWG, noting that the EFPWG had met four 
times between February and April 1999 and expressed the appreciation of the Working 
Group to the valuable contribution from the three external scientists. The four reports 
from the EFPWG were tabled for the Commission records. 
 
 
Members continued efforts to agree on the design of a possible experimental fishing 
program during the course of the meeting. While agreement was reached on a number 
of elements of an EFP, full agreement on a program for 1999 could not be reached 
before the adjournment of the meeting. Members undertook to establish arrangements to 
progress outstanding issues through out-of-session consultations. 
 
Agenda Item 3: Total Allowable Catch and its Allocation 
 
Members noted that this matter would be considered further when outstanding EFP 
issues had been resolved. Pending resolution of these outstanding issues, Australia and 
New Zealand advised that they would restrain national catches to the most recently 
agreed levels, being 5265t for Australia and 420t for New Zealand. Japan also advised 
that it would restrain its national catch to a level which would be advised at a later date. 
 
Agenda Item 4: Report from the Scientific Committee 
 
Consideration of this item was deferred to the next meeting of the Commission. 
 
Agenda Item 5: Trade Information Scheme 
 
Members discussed the development of a trade information scheme and expressed 
concern that while they had reduced their catches substantially, the level of non-
member catch has steadily increased. 
 
The Parties agreed to hold a workshop in Japan for 3 days in the week commencing 26 
July 1999. To this end, a contact group was established consisting of Dr Bray 
(Australia), Mr Endo (Japan) and Ms Geddis (New Zealand), to prepare for the 
Workshop. The agreed agenda for the workshop is shown as Attachment D. Members 
undertook to consider the paper proposing provisional ideas for a scheme distributed by 
Australia in October 1998, and provide comments for discussion at the workshop by 30 
June 1999. 
 
Australia stated that the introduction of a trade information scheme was important and 
that in the longer term, the development of a trade certification scheme would be 
fundamental to ensuring the effective operation of the Commission in achieving its 
conservation and management objectives. Australia noted also that the importance of 
developing a trade certification scheme was recognised by the Commission at CCSBT 5 
(1). Australia noted that other international fisheries management bodies have 
developed trade certification schemes, and that further work should be undertaken by 
the Commission as a matter of urgency. 
 
Australia reaffirmed its commitment to finalising arrangements for the implementation 
of a trade information scheme by the end of 1999, recognising that there were a number 
of technical and practical issues to be settled, including ensuring consistency with WTO 
requirements. 
 
 
New Zealand also considered that a scheme to obtain better information about SBT 
through trade was an important step in securing the effective conservation and 
management of the stock. New Zealand confirmed its commitment to the development 
of such a scheme, with a view to its implementation by the Commission by the end of 
1999. 
 
Japan acknowledged that illegal, uncontrolled and unreported fishing was adversely 
affecting proper management of the SBT stock and the introduction of a trade 
information scheme would be an effective measure to help address this issue. Japan 
noted also that a number of fundamental and technical issues still needed to be settled 
and while it could not commit to introduction of the scheme by the end of 1999, it 
would make its best endeavors to settle issues concerning the scheme as soon as 
possible. 
 
Agenda Item 6: Relationship with Non-members 
 
Members reiterated their grave concern that catches by non-members were adversely 
affecting the proper management of the SBT stock and called on non-members to either 
join the Commission or cooperate with its management measures, as soon as possible. 
The Members indicated that the cooperation of all counties and entities fishing for SBT 
was vital to the CCSBT and those industries dependent on the resource. 
 
Japan advised that bilateral discussions had been held recently with representatives 
from Korea and Taiwan on this matter. However, Japan noted that no firm commitments 
were received. 
 
The representative of the Republic of Korea indicated that as a responsible fishing 
nation, it wished to cooperate with the CCSBT to achieve proper management of the 
stock. However, the Republic of Korea noted that its industry was concerned that 
membership would result in an unacceptable reduction to the level of catch through the 
allocation of quota by the CCSBT. Therefore, Korea sought favourable consideration of 
its position and undertook to continue to seek to cooperate with the CCSBT in SBT 
management. 
 
Taiwan advised that its long term objective was to be granted membership of the 
CCSBT.  However, pending resolution of that request, Taiwan indicated that it would 
continue to cooperate with the CCSBT by restraining its catch levels to 1450 tonnes per 
year, participate in any agreed trade information scheme, and work with the CCSBT to 
address the issue of fishing by flag of convenience vessels. Taiwan indicated that if 
membership was not seriously considered, it would be difficult to maintain full 
cooperation with CCSBT management arrangements in the long term. 
 
Members noted the advice provided by the Republic of Korea and Taiwan and indicated 
that the CCSBT would continue to discuss the outstanding issues with them with a view 
to facilitating CCSBT membership or formal cooperation with management 
arrangements, as soon as possible. 
 
 
Separate discussions between Commission representatives and, the representatives of 
Republic of Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan were conducted during the 
course of the Meeting and records of discussions of theses meeting were tabled 
(Attachment E, F and G respectively). 
 
Agenda Item 7: Arrangements for Data Management 
 
Consideration of this item was deferred to the next meeting of the Commission. 
 
Agenda Item 8: Report from the Compliance Committee 
 
Consideration of this item was deferred to the next meeting of the Commission. 
 
Agenda Item 9: Work Program for 1999 
 
Consideration of this item was deferred. 
 
Agenda Item 10: Other Business 
 
Consideration of this item was deferred. 
 
Agenda Item 11: Close of the Meeting 
 
It was decided to adjourn the meeting on the understanding that all members would be 
available to continue discussion, as appropriate, to seek to resolve outstanding issues 
concerning the EFP, as quickly as possible.

RECORD OF THE BILATERAL MEETING BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES 
OF THE COMMISSION AND INDONESIA 
 
MITA KAIKAN, TOKYO, 12 MAY 1999 
 
Participants 
 
Mr Peter Yuile, First Assistant Secretary, Fisheries and Forestry Industries Division, 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry - Australia 
 
Mr Hisashi Endo, Deputy Director, International Affairs Division, Fisheries Policy 
Planning Department, Fisheries Agency, Japan 
 
Dr Talbot Murray, Pelagic Project Leader, National Institute of Water and 
Atmospheric Research Ltd, New Zealand 
 
Mr Rismansyah Danasaputra, Agricultural Attache, Embassy of the Republic of 
Indonesia 
 
Record 
 
Mr Yuile reiterated appreciation for Indonesia's attendance at CCSBT 5 as an observer. 
Commission members were in agreement on the need for effective management and 
conservation of the SBT fishery, including through accession to, or cooperation with, 
the Commission by non-members. The separate bilateral meetings with non-members 
should be seen as an indication of the importance the Commission attached to this issue. 
Indonesia took a significant amount of SBT in the form of by-catch. The Commission 
was therefore keen for Indonesia to accede to the Convention on mutually advantageous 
terms as soon as possible. Australia and other Commission members had a number of 
ideas on a package which could assist Indonesia's accession, and wished to commence 
discussions to this end as soon as possible. 
 
Mr Danasaputra expressed appreciation for the Commission's invitation to Indonesia to 
attend CCSBT 5 as an observer. He referred to Indonesia's opening statement (Annex 1) 
in the plenary session the previous day. Indonesia was aware that the SBT spawning 
ground was located in its waters, and was therefore deserving of priority status in 
research activities. He agreed that SBT was a by-catch of Indonesian long-liners whose 
principal focus was bigeye and yellowfin tuna. Indonesia was grateful for the Australian 
CSIRO's cooperation in monitoring activities for SBT. Indonesia was certainly keen to 
support and cooperate with the CCSBT, but it was of the view that there was room for 
improved links between the IOTC and the CCSBT. Having said this, however, 
Indonesia would welcome discussion on the Commission's package for accession to the 
Convention. 
 
In response to Mr Yuile's question, Mr Danasaputra said that a visit to Jakarta or Bali by 
CCSBT representatives would be appropriate following the Indonesian general election 
 
on 7 June. The key contact on the Indonesian side should be Mr Untung Wachyono, 
Director-General of Fisheries in the Department of Agriculture. Mr Untung had 
participated in CCSBT 3 as an observer, so he had some experience on the SBT issue. 
 
Mr Yuile asked Mr Danasaputra to convey to the Indonesian Government the 
Commission's wish to discuss Indonesia's early accession to the Convention. The 
Commission's Secretariat would serve as the major conduit for communication, and 
would contact Mr Untung in the near future on this issue.  Australia would be pleased 
to help facilitate dialogue with Indonesia if the other Commission parties were 
agreeable.

Annex 1 
 
Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for giving us the floor. 
 
I was just recently informed by Jakarta that I was to represent Indonesia at this 
conference. Accordingly, on behalf of the Indonesian Government, I would like to 
express my sincere thanks and gratitude to the CCSBT Secretariat and member 
countries, for inviting Indonesia to this important conference as an observer. 
 
It is considered that the Southern Bluefin tuna (SBT) is a by-catch in Indonesian tuna 
long-line fisheries where, based on population size, the Yellowfin tuna is the main 
species constituting the tuna stock. The Southern Bluefin tuna is more likely to be 
caught by tuna long-liners specifically designed for and aimed at Bigeye tuna. It should 
be noted that of all the 553 tuna long-liners based in Benoa and Bali, none are catching  
Southern Bluefin tuna. 
 
Indonesia is very grateful to the CISRO for the monitoring activities it carries out 
together with the Indonesian Research Institute for Marine Fisheries. We anticipate that 
these activities will develop into a more in-depth research collaboration. The logbook 
system that  has just been started is now being applied in Indonesia. With this kind of 
effort, we can expect to have improved information on the Southern Bluefin tuna. 
 
Indonesia is aware that the CCSBT considers a part of Indonesia’s waters  to be a 
spawning ground of the Southern Bluefin tuna and  deserving of  priority status in 
research activities. On the basis of this understanding, significant efforts are being made, 
including, among others, securing national funding for research on Southern Bluefin 
tuna and, of course, seeking internationally funded and collaborated research activities. 
 
Considering that the Southern Bluefin tuna belongs to the tuna species, we are also of 
the view that more efficient management of the Southern Bluefin could become part of 
the responsibility of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC). 
 
Thank you.

Record of discussion between the representatives of the Republic of Korea and 
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) 
Tokyo, 12 May 1999 
 
 
Representatives of CCSBT and the Republic of Korea met to discuss issues relating to 
ROK’s cooperation with the SBT management regime and in particular ROK’s 
accession to the Convention. The List of Participants is shown at Annex 1. 
 
The representatives of the Republic of the Korea responded to the talking points made 
by the representatives of CCSBT (Annex 2) as follows: 
 
i) 
The catch of SBT by Korea in 1998 exceeded 2,000 tonnes; 
 
ii) The Government of Korea had strong interests on the activities of CCSBT which 
was demonstrated by participating at CCSBT meetings as observers; 
 
iii) However, the fishing industry was facing a difficult situation and fishermen 
criticized the Government in relation to the new Korea-Japan Fisheries Agreement; 
 
iv) As mentioned at the last opportunity when the representatives of CCSBT visited 
Korea in April 1998, the Government had to introduce regulatory measures to 
control the licensed vessels in order to accede to the regional fisheries organization. 
However, the current situation made it difficult for the Government to do so. 
 
The representatives of CCSBT reiterated the requests for Korea to meet its international 
obligation to accede to CCSBT and agree on a reasonable level of quota. In addition, 
they asked the representatives of Korea to convey to their Government the request to 
establish a timetable for the discussions on accession. The representatives advised them 
the CCSBT Secretariat would communicate with the Korean Government on this. 
 
While noting the comments made by the representatives of CCSBT, Korea commented 
that 1) the Government was undertaking negotiations with the industry over the issue of 
quota, 2) the views of the Government and the industry were still different and the 
Government was trying to reach a resolution, 3) the timetable for consultation with 
CCSBT would depend on the progress in the Government consultation with industry 
and 4) the Government was concerned that it would become difficult to make progress 
if the Government did not have a good relationship with the industry. 
 
Finally, the representative of CCSBT expressed their desire for a response by the 
Government of Korea on this issue.

Annex 2 
 
Taking points to Korea 
 
1. CCSBT established by Australia, Japan and New Zealand, adopts annual total 
allowable catch (TAC) and national allocation for member states. CCSBT member 
states have made remarkable reduction on TAC and national allocation to around 
one third since 1988 for the purpose of recovering SBT stock. 
 
2. However, Korea have increased SBT catch rapidly since 1996 and it was reported 
by Korea that catch in 1998 reached more than 2,000 MT. CCSBT members have 
grave concern about the negative impact of such large amount of SBT catch by 
Korea on the SBT stock. 
We draw Korea’s attention to the clear international obligations to cooperate with 
CCSBT as the regional fisheries management organisation with competence for 
southern bluefin tuna. 
We would like you to take back our desire to establish a timetable for discussions on 
accession. We will ask the CCSBT Secretariat to follow up with Seoul directly. 
 
3. 
CCSBT members make following request. 
a) 
accede to CCSBT immediately 
b) 
agree on a reasonable level of quota.

CCSBT 
Record of Discussions between the Commission and Representatives of Taiwan 
Tokyo, 12 May 1999 
 
 
The Commission, represented by Mr Mark Edwards, Head of the New Zealand 
Delegation, welcomed the representatives from Taiwan and made the following points 
to the representatives: 
 
• 
The Commission recognized that authorities in Taipei have had an association with 
the CCSBT for a number of years through attendance at meetings of the 
Commission and scientific committee as an observer; 
 
• 
It also recognized the voluntary restraint that they had exercised on catch in recent 
years of 1450 tonnes per annum and reconfirmation of this at the Commission's 
meeting.   It also acknowledged advice that they were willing to provide statistical 
data and participate in any trade information scheme; 
 
• 
That said, given the low level of SBT parental biomass and the Commission’s 
objective of restore SBT stock to 1980 levels by 2020, the Commission remained 
seriously concerned that catch outside Commission undermined the management 
measures adopted by the Commission members since the late 1980s; 
 
• 
As a significant fisher of SBT the Commission would welcome their closer 
involvement in the work of the Commission to ensure that SBT was a sustainable 
and valuable fishery in the future; 
 
• 
The Commission had noted their interest in becoming a full member of the 
Commission.  However, the Convention did not allow for this.  They would also be 
aware of the political reality of this situation; the parties were not in a position to 
have Taiwan accede to the Commission with member status; 
 
• 
However, the Commission wished to conclude an arrangement that provided for 
their cooperation with and participation in the work of the Commission.  This would 
include the privileges and responsibilities that would accrue to a co-operating party; 
 
• 
The Commission was developing a mechanism that could provide for cooperation 
and would like to discuss this further in due course, including details such as the 
level of quota. 
 
2 
Representatives from Taiwan responded that they were aware of the difficulties 
associated with accession to the Convention.  They noted their sincere desire to acquire 
membership of the Commission but, if difficulties associated with the Convention 
prevented this, they were prepared to respond in a flexible manner. 
 
 
3 
The representatives noted that mention had been made of "cooperating party" status 
and inquired as to the difference between this status and membership in terms of 
privileges and attendance at meetings.  The representatives asked when the Commission 
might be able to make such further information available.  
 
4 
The representatives explained their position from the beginning had been that it 
was absolutely necessary for them to cooperate with the Commission.  There was a 
strong hope that they would be treated in an equitable manner with other members 
within the framework of the Commission. The issue, from their perspective, was 
whether the status of "cooperating party" would provide such equitable treatment. 
 
5 
The Commission welcomed the positive response from the representatives and 
their willingness to discuss the issues and looked forward to a continuing dialogue.  The 
Commission explained that it was unable to provide a firm date for further 
communications as the Commission was continuing to consider the issue, but reassured 
the representatives that it regarded this as an important and urgent issue and that further 
approaches would be made in the near future.  The Commission acknowledged the 
desire for equitable participation in the Commission and was looking to provide the 
fullest possible involvement, with similar privileges and responsibilities to those of 
members.  The Commission noted that it was grateful for the voluntary steps of 
cooperation that had been undertaken and appreciated the undertaking that such 
cooperation would be continued in the future. 
 
6 
A representative of the tuna industry, Mr Oh, then noted that, in the interests of the 
conservation and management of the resource, the industry had a strong desire to 
cooperate with the Commission and noted its strong hope that the Commission would 
take into account the balance between responsibilities and privileges. 
 
7 
The Commission thanked the industry for their comments and for their continuing 
cooperation.  It noted that the industry shared the Commission's interest in the 
conservation and management of the stock and welcomed the industry's voluntary steps 
to assist in this objective.   
 
8 
The representatives expressed their thanks to the Commission and noted that they 
would convey the conversation to authorities in Taipei, who would look forward to 
receiving the Commission's proposal in the near future. 
 
9 
As the meeting closed, the Japanese delegate to the Commission, Kagawa-san, 
noted also that Japan appreciated the cooperation which had been extended in respect of 
scrapping excess fishing capacity and controlling the use of flag of convenience vessels 
and looked forward to continuing a bilateral dialogue on this issue.
