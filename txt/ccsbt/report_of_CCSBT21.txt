Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
10. Members noted the activities of the Secretariat as reported in CCSBT-
EC/1410/04. 
11. A Korean intern is scheduled to join the Secretariat commencing in late 2014 and 
his placement in the Secretariat will be fully funded by Korea.  The Executive 
Secretary noted that the internship role will essentially be a learning and 
development opportunity, and that the intern will not be given access to 
confidential data.  The intern’s presence will be beneficial to the Secretariat, 
especially with regard to preparation for meetings scheduled to be held in Korea 
during 2015.   
12. In addition, Members noted Professor Ray Hilborn’s recent resignation from the 
CCSBT Scientific Advisory Panel.  The Extended Commission agreed that the 
Executive Secretary will write to Professor Hilborn to advise him that the 
Extended Commission expressed its deep appreciation for his many valuable 
years of service as a Member of the CCSBT Scientific Advisory Panel. 
13. Members requested that the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) provide 
advice to the EC on whether Prof. Hilborn needs to be replaced, and if so, the 
appropriate skillset required for a replacement Scientific Advisory Panel 
member. New Zealand requested that Members take into account the relevant 
Performance Review recommendations when considering the required skillset. 
14. The proposed amendment to the “Resolution to Establish the Status of 
Cooperating Non-Members of the Extended Commission and the Extended 
Scientific Committee” was adopted (Attachment 7). 
15. New Zealand noted that it had considered possible additional amendments to the 
Resolution to allow for possible inclusion of other parties with an interest in 
SBT, for example flag states of carrier vessels, or port or market states. Given the 
limited time available at this meeting, it was noted that development of a revised 
strategic plan could provide another opportunity to consider this matter. 
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
16. The Executive Secretary provided an outline of financial matters that the EC 
would need to consider, including the revised budget for 2014 (CCSBT-
EC/1410/05), and the proposed budget for 2015 (CCSBT-EC/1410/06).   
17. The forecast expenditure for 2014 provides savings in all six cost centres of the 
budget. The most significant savings were in relation to meetings and resulted 
due to deposits being paid in late 2013 (and thus not appearing in the 2014 
expenditure), reduced numbers of participants at meetings, and savings on travel, 
consultancy fees, translations, catering and exchange rates. 
18. The Executive Secretary noted that three versions of the 2015 draft budget had 
been prepared. One version included an allowance for a $100,000 contribution to 
the scientific aerial survey, while the alternative budgets included $200,000 and 
$800,000 contributions to the aerial survey as requested by Australia in August 
2014.  Detailed consideration of the two budget papers was referred to the 
Finance and Administration Committee (FAC). 
 
19. The FAC was convened to consider: 
• The revised budget for 2014; 
• The proposed budget for 2015; and 
• Related matters, including financial implications of meetings and workplans 
proposed by the Compliance Committee (CC) and the Extended Scientific 
Committee (ESC). 
20. Dr. Kevin Sullivan was nominated as Chair of the FAC. 
 
3.1. Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
21. The Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC) presented the 
report of the FAC, which is provided at Attachment 8. It includes a revised 
budget for 2014 and a recommended budget for 2015. 
2014 
22. The FAC Chair noted the revised 2014 budget includes three small changes, 
resulting in net savings of $13,000 for 2014.  These savings will be carried 
forward to the 2015 budget. The FAC also considered the Performance Review 
Panel’s comments regarding regular budget under-spending, but no changes were 
recommended in this regard. 
23. The meeting adopted the revised 2014 budget which is provided at Annex A of 
the FAC’s report. 
2015 
24. The proposed budget for 2015 results in an overall cost increase of 6.2% in 
Members’ contributions, and it was noted that Scientific Research Plan (SRP) 
expenses are forecast to increase for the years 2016 and 2017. 
25. The meeting adopted the 2015 budget which is provided at Annex B of the 
FAC’s report.  
26. Following adoption of the 2015 budget, Australia commented that the Scientific 
Aerial Survey costs $800,000 per year to run and that the $200,000 contribution 
offered by the EC was not sufficient for it to run the survey in 2015, particularly 
considering that approximately $60,000 of the $200,000 was also from Australia.  
Consequently, Australia will only be able to run the survey every second year, 
and even that will require an increased contribution from the CCSBT.  Australia 
noted that the ESC Chair had advised that if the survey was to be conducted 
every second year, then it would be highly desirable to conduct the survey in 
2016 to inform the running of the Management Procedure in that year. 
27. Appreciation was expressed for the contribution made by Australia for the 
scientific aerial survey.  Members expressed concern that the lack of aerial 
survey data in future will affect the Management Procedure (MP). The EC 
requested the ESC to consider the implications of this for the Management 
Procedure process and advise how best to run or re-tune the MP in the event that 
no aerial survey data is available for 2015 and potentially also 2016 and beyond.  
28. Japan stated that it was regrettable that the aerial survey would not be conducted 
in 2015.  Japan further reminded that the aerial survey has been conducted by 
 
Australia because purse seine CPUE could not contribute to stock assessment, 
and Japan contributed to the development of the aerial survey methodology 
financially and technically in the 1990s. 
29. Since governments tend to conduct financial planning for future years, Korea and 
Australia proposed that the Commission consider producing 3-year rolling 
budgets for future scientific and compliance work in order to assist with longer 
term government financial planning.  The CC Chair confirmed that the CC 
already has a 3-year rolling plan in place, and it would just need to an associate a 
budget with that plan. 
30. It was agreed that the Executive Secretary will prepare a paper for CCSBT 22 
with indicative 3-year budgets for future years and that the paper would identify 
the major uncertainties in the indicative budgets. It was noted that the year 2 and 
3 budgets would be indicative only, and would not represent a commitment to 
those budget items. 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries and ERS Interactions 
31. The Chair noted the deliberations of the Compliance Committee and invited 
Members to ask any additional questions regarding Members’ and CNMs’ 
National Reports to those already raised at CC9.  
32. Australia provided an update regarding its Stereo Video (STV) research project 
and advised that $500,000 had been invested in this research, and that an update 
on project progress would be available by mid-2015. 
33. Australia provided a description of the STV research project to Members.  
34. The EU offered to provide information on ICCAT's developments on 
stereoscopic cameras. 
 
4.1. Reports on Members’ projects 
35. The Chair opened the floor for any special reports from Members. There were no 
special reports. 
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
36. The Chair of the Compliance Committee (CC) presented the report of the Ninth 
Meeting of the Compliance Committee (CC9), including its workplan, and 
thanked participants for a productive and cooperative meeting.   
37. The CC Chair confirmed that CC9 had endorsed the Extended Scientific 
Committee’s (ESC19’s) requests, but further advised that CC9 was not able to 
reach a consensus with respect to making Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) 
or market information available to the ESC. 
38. The CC Chair also drew attention to CC9’s recommendations at paragraph 100 of 
its report. 
 
39. The Extended Commission adopted CC9’s report and recommendations with the 
exception of the following recommendation, which it was agreed would be 
discussed further under agenda item 11 of this meeting: 
• That the Cooperating Non-Member status of the European Union, South 
Africa and the Philippines be continued. 
40. In relation to the Chair’s reference to paragraph 68 of the CC9 report, Japan 
stated that on an occasion where a Member fails to adhere to a CCSBT 
administrative rule, such as the late notification of carry-forward of unfished 
allocation by Australia, the situation can be resolved with discussion in good 
faith among Members. 
41. Australia reiterated its understanding of the rules of the Convention, that 
notwithstanding an administrative oversight, Australia is entitled to carry forward 
the unfished allocation without reference to the Extended Commission. 
42. Korea, advised that Japan and Taiwan would discuss allowable discrepancies 
between weights measured at-sea and landing weight on CDS Catch Monitoring 
Forms. 
43. The report of the Ninth Compliance Committee meeting (CC9), including its 
workplan and recommendations, is provided at Attachment 9.  
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
44. The Chair of the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) presented the report of 
the ESC meeting which is summarised in papers CCSBT-EC/1410/09 and 
CCSBT-EC/1410/18.   
45. Members asked the ESC Chair a number of questions on the nature of the advice 
from ESC with respect to unaccounted mortalities, the uncertainty in the surface 
fishery over-catch scenario in the base case assessment, and the Scientific 
Research Programme (SRP).  In response to these questions, the ESC Chair 
advised that: 
• The ESC recommended that the EC continue to follow the Management 
Procedure as formulated, with no revision to the recommended 2016-17 TAC, 
and that the MP be reviewed as planned in 2017. If a better estimate of 
unaccounted mortality was to become available before 2016, then the MP 
could be re-tuned in 2016 to take this into account; 
• The base case (or reference set) of the operating model includes the scenario 
of 20% over catch for the surface fishery up to 2013, but the reference set for 
the projections from 2014 does not include this; 
• For gene tagging studies, the understanding is that this project will be 
reviewed after the design phase in order to determine if it should continue; and 
• Implementation of a new large-scale tagging programme was not considered 
by the ESC.  Past tagging data have been useful to the ESC for movement data 
and growth estimates but have been of limited use in stock assessment.  
46. Japan reminded Members that the ESC report noted that experimental trials 
comparing stereo video to the 100 fish sample could be used to investigate the 
 
accuracy of 100 fish sample and queried whether these results could be used by 
the ESC.  Australia clarified that the current research is focused on automation.  
The ESC Chair noted the results could be reviewed for usefulness by the ESC in 
2015 if they became available in a timely fashion. 
47. Members identified two areas of concern regarding the recommendations in 
ESC’s report: 
• New Zealand noted that the ESC report concluded that it appears that 
significant levels of unaccounted mortality may have occurred which were not 
considered in the design of the Management Procedure (MP).  New Zealand 
believed that significant levels of unaccounted mortality have occurred, that 
exceptional circumstances have occurred and was surprised by the ESC’s 
recommendation that the 2016-17 TAC be retained as originally specified.  
• New Zealand asked the Chair of the ESC to confirm that the advice from the 
ESC was consistent with the precautionary approach, noting that the ESC was 
under an obligation to take this approach. The ESC Chair confirmed that this 
was the view of the ESC. 
• Japan noted its concern with Attachment 5 of the ESC’s report with respect to 
Japanese market data. Japan further noted that the ESC posed no specific 
concern to Japanese market.  Japan believed that it is inappropriate to treat 
such a low probability matter in the same way as an actual problem. 
• Australia reiterated that it was necessary to address the ESC recommendations 
as a total package, rather than in a piece-meal way.  The ESC had not given 
any ranking to its recommendations. 
48. The Extended Commission adopted the report of ESC19 and noted the ESC’s 
recommendations.  
49. The report of the 2014 ESC meeting is at Attachment 10.  
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
7.1. Attributable SBT Catch 
50. The EC considered the definition of attributable catch provided by CC9 and 
agreed on the following revised definition: 
“A Member or CNM’s attributable catch against its national allocation is the 
total Southern Bluefin Tuna mortality resulting from fishing activities within 
its jurisdiction or control1 including, inter alia, mortality resulting from: 
• commercial fishing operations whether primarily targeting SBT or not; 
• releases and/or discards; 
• recreational fishing; 
• customary and/or traditional fishing; and 
• artisanal fishing.” 
                                                 
 
1 Except where a vessel is chartered to a person or entity of another Member or CNM, and if a catch is attributable 
to that Member or CNM. 
 
51. Members held extensive discussions in relation to implementing the definition of 
Attributable SBT Catch agreed at CC9.  The Chair described the outcome of 
these discussions as a genuine endeavour to operationalise the attributable catch 
definition and to take into account advice regarding unaccounted mortalities. 
52. Following these discussions and noting the ESC advice relating to unaccounted 
mortalities, the EC agreed to: 
• Confirm the 2016-17 global TAC; 
• The principle that CCSBT will make an adjustment for non-Member catch in 
the next TAC period (2018-2020) and beyond; 
• Act in good faith to implement the common definition of attributable catch 
adopted at CCSBT21 as soon as practicable but not later than the 2018 quota 
year; 
• The principle that Members and CNMs will begin to make adjustments to their 
national allocations in line with the common definition of attributable catch. 
These adjustments would be made on the basis of best available information; 
• Direct the ESC, CC and Members and CNMs to undertake analyses to provide 
estimates of non-member catch; and 
• Commission market analyses on significant markets to contribute to estimating 
non-member catch. 
53. The action points shown in Table 1 were agreed by Members, noting that within 
the table, “External” refers to non-Member catches, while “Internal” relates to 
Members’ attributable catches.

54. New Zealand thanked other Members for the cooperative approach taken to a 
difficult issue. It stated that in agreeing to confirm the TAC for 2016 and 2017, 
New Zealand relies on the assurance that the advice from the ESC is 
precautionary in nature, consistent with its obligations to this Extended 
Commission, and that it also relies on the assurances of Members that they will 
act in good faith to take action to implement the agreed common definition of 
attributable catch. 
55. New Zealand expressed its disappointment at the failure to agree to the exchange 
of CDS and market data at this meeting. It stated that the ESC has identified 
access to this information as being important to its work, and New Zealand 
therefore strongly encourages Members to resolve this issue intersessionally, 
giving consideration to independent analysis to assist in the review. New Zealand 
said that it would be open to providing an independent review of the CDS 
information. 
56. Japan shared New Zealand’s view regarding unaccounted mortalities that the 
CCSBT needs to have cooperation, integrity, and good faith coming from all 
Members. Japan supported the idea of an independent review of CDS data. 
57. Australia declared its interest in the independent review, but it should be in the 
context of the data requirements of the ESC, which includes both CDS data and 
market data. It stated that for the ESC to be able to provide complete estimates of 
unaccounted mortality all data should be examined and looked at, not just CDS 
data. 
 
7.2. TAC Determination 
58. Humane Society International stated that it would like to see the EC develop a 
new stock assessment based on and including all sources of mortality, and for the 
EC to hold off any decisions on TAC and delay any increase until that stock 
assessment has been completed or is clearly underway. 
59. The Chair advised that EC has agreed that the TAC for 2015 will be 14,647 t as 
recommended by the Management Procedure. 
60. The Chair referred to paragraph 123 of the SC 19 report, which states: 
 
“Based on the results of the MP operation for 2015-17 in 2013 and the 
outcome of the review of exceptional circumstances in Agenda Item 10.1, the 
ESC recommended that there is no need to revise the EC’s 2013 TAC decision 
regarding the TACs for 2016-17. The recommended annual TAC for the years 
2016-2017 is 14,647 t.” 
61. The EC confirmed that the TAC would be 14,647 t for each of the years from 
2016 and 2017. 
 
7.3. Research Mortality Allowance 
62. The EC approved the requests from Australia for Research Mortality Allowances 
(RMA) totalling 5.95 t in 2015. 
63. It was noted that the EC has agreed that an allocation of 10 t would be made for 
Research Mortality Allowance within the TAC recommended by the MP. 
 
7.4. Allocation of TAC 
64. Indonesia reiterated the proposal it submitted to CCSBT 20 to increase its 
national allocation by 300 t and QAR phase-1 and phase-2 has been undertaken. 
It stated that the current allocation was too low in relation to the number of 
fishing vessels and in consideration of its artisanal vessels, which have a long 
history catching SBT within Indonesia’s EEZ where SBT migrates. Indonesia 
asked the EC to consider article 8(4c) of the Convention which states that in 
deciding upon allocations among the Parties 3, the Commission shall consider 
“the interests of Parties through whose exclusive economic or fishery zone 
southern bluefin tuna migrates”. Indonesia believes that accommodating their 
interest in the SBT quota system, will provide a great contribution to artisanal 
fishers in terms of better life and income, and at the same time, will also 
eliminate the increase of unaccounted SBT mortality in the future. Indonesia 
requested EC Meeting to develop a paragraph to respond Indonesia’s request as it 
is described in Paragraph 45. 
65. The Chair summarised Members’ discussion of this issue. Having noted the 
comprehensive presentation by Indonesia and the steps proposed to strengthen its 
management arrangements in 2015, Members showed considerable sympathy for 
its position.  A number of ways to accommodate Indonesia’s request were 
discussed but given the current position of the stock, none were able to be 
progressed. Members noted that in the situation of a rising TAC, this situation 
would change. Members were heartened by Indonesia’s plans to improve its SBT 
management and encouraged them to continue this process. 
66. The meeting confirmed that the allocations for 2015-2017 would be as specified 
in paper CCSBT-EC/1410/10.  The agreed allocations are provided in Table 2 
below.

Agenda Item 8. 
Performance Review of the CCSBT 
67. The second Performance Review of CCSBT was conducted by an independent 
review panel during 2014. The Chair noted paper CCSBT-EC/1410/11 which 
provides the report of the Performance Review.  
68. The Chair of the independent performance review panel, Dr Serge Garcia, 
presented the panel’s findings, including the review panel’s methodology and its 
evaluation of CCSBT’s performance against international standards and best 
practice in six main areas: 
• Conservation & management; 
• Compliance & enforcement; 
• Decision-making, transparency & dispute settlement; 
• International cooperation; 
• Financial and administrative issues; and 
• Overall CCSBT performance review process. 
69. Areas highlighted in Dr. Garcia’s presentation included the following: 
• CCSBT’s science and advisory process appears to fit with best practice, 
however rebuilding is occurring very slowly, and no rebuilding trajectory has 
been specified by CCSBT; 
• The development of a Strategic Plan is a significant achievement, and the 
Commission may also wish to consider adopting an operational management 
plan, the elements for which are readily available;   
• Items such as the introduction of the CDS and Quality Assurance Reviews 
(QARs) also represent major advances in the Compliance area, and the 
recruitment of the Compliance Manager is another positive step; 
                                                 
 
2 These figures apportion the additional 110 t (from South Africa) to Japan because all other Members have 
reached their nominal allocation. 
 
• More progress and data is required with respect to Ecologically Related 
Species (ERS), and this should take into account that harmonisation of 
measures is a two-way process between relevant RFMOs; 
• Foresight needs to be developed regarding the potential impacts of climate 
change on SBT’s abundance and distribution, and its future management; and 
• More work needs to be done on consideration of an ecosystem-based approach 
and identification of potential impacts of the SBT fishery on the ecosystem in 
line with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) requirements. 
70. With regard to the process followed for the performance review, Dr. Garcia 
concluded that the CCSBT has fulfilled the requirements of the FAO guidelines 
on the performance reviews of RFMOs. 
71. Members expressed their appreciation to Dr. Garcia for his presentation, and then 
posed a series of comments and questions about the presentation. The EU advised 
that it has implemented the CDS. The EU hoped for broader progress on market 
measures, notably the possibility to progress towards the adoption of trade-
related measures similar to ICCAT. Indonesia noted that it would not be able to 
provide VMS data from vessels operating within its EEZ as this would conflict 
with its domestic legislation.  Japan commented that some of the review panel’s 
recommendations did not seem relevant to a RFMO that does not have a specific 
Convention Area. 
72. The Chair noted that the Commission needed to consider how to progress and 
implement and operationalise relevant Review Panel recommendations, given 
that the Review Panel’s recommendations could be broadly divided into two 
main groups: 
• Governance and management recommendations; and 
• Technical recommendations that relate to either the science, ERS or 
compliance subsidiary bodies. 
73. It was suggested that one approach could be that Governance and management 
recommendations are reviewed by Commissioners, and that technical 
recommendations are first reviewed by the relevant subsidiary body, which then 
provide advice back to the EC. The meeting noted that subsidiary bodies had not 
yet fully considered the Performance Review Panel’s recommendations, and 
further that CC9 had thought it presumptive to include them in its Three Year 
Compliance Action Plan (CAP) before they had been reviewed by the EC. 
74. The full list of the Review Panel’s recommendations is provided at Attachment 
11. The last column of this attachment has been added to denote the subsidiary 
body to which the recommendation is relevant. Where this column is blank, the 
recommendation is probably better considered directly by the EC. 
75. A process for including the Review Panel’s recommendations into the CCSBT’s 
Strategic Plan was discussed further under agenda item 9.2. 
 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Implementation of the CCSBT Strategic Plan 
9.1.  Action scheduled for 2014 
9.1.1. Flag State/Fishing Entity self-assessment of capacity (low priority) 
76. The Chair noted that New Zealand had previously presented its self-assessment 
of fishing capacity to CCSBT20 (refer to paper CCSBT-EC/1410/BGD01). 
77. Australia, Japan, Korea and Taiwan introduced their fishing capacity self-
assessments as detailed in papers CCSBT-EC/1410/19, 22, 25 and 24 
respectively. No fishing over-capacity was identified. 
78. Indonesia noted that it would provide a self-assessment of its fishing capacity to 
CCSBT22 because this would then take into account its new management 
measures. 
 
9.2.  Future Action 
79. The Chair referred to paper CCSBT-EC/1410/12 on the implementation of the 
CCSBT Strategic Plan and noted that the detailed five year Action Plan of the 
CCSBT Strategic Plan concludes in 2014. 
80. New Zealand commented that the Strategic Plan had been a useful tool for the 
EC and had assisted with prioritisation of its work, and that while most of the 
objectives remained relevant, the actions required updating. It added that the 
development of a consolidated operational Fisheries Management Plan might 
complement the Strategic Plan. 
81. New Zealand volunteered to prepare a first draft updated Strategic Plan and 
associated Action Plan for future years that will incorporate relevant elements 
from the Performance Review Panel’s recommendations, in consultation with 
both Members and the Secretariat.  Advice from the ESC and CC will be sought 
in the development of the Strategic Plan. 
82. Members thanked New Zealand and accepted its offer.  
83. Development of the Strategic Plan will be progressed at a 3-day meeting of the 
Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group (SFMWG) in Canberra in 
June 2015 (date to be confirmed). 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Modification of CCSBT’s ERS Recommendation 
84. Australia introduced paper CCSBT-EC/1410/20 which provided Australia’s draft 
Resolution to Mitigate the Impact on Seabirds of Fishing for Southern Bluefin 
Tuna.  Australia elaborated that: 
• The CCSBT remains the only RFMO without a comprehensive set of binding 
measures to mitigate impacts of fishing on these species. 
• The ERSWG noted that there are widespread and substantial catches of 
seabirds in SBT fisheries and has called on the EC to urgently implement more 
effective mitigation measures. The CCSBT performance review also 
recommended that the CCSBT do more work on monitoring and gathering 
 
data about the impacts of fishing on ERS, developing mitigation measures, and 
assessing compliance with such measures. 
• The new proposal seeks to address concerns raised by Members in relation to 
previous proposals, including harmonisation with conservation and 
management measures of other RFMOs. 
• The measures in the proposal represent current best practice in mitigating 
seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries. They are also consistent with the 
obligations that apply to vessels in the WCPFC, IOTC, and ICCAT areas of 
competence.  
85. New Zealand noted it would support adoption of a binding measure on ERS. 
There was general support for the proposal, but Taiwan and Japan had concerns. 
Taiwan indicated that it needed more time for domestic consultations given the 
technical, data, and reporting requirements of the proposal, and would like to 
refer the proposal to the next ERSWG.  Japan mentioned that there were some 
differences between Australia’s proposal and WCPFC’s measures.  Japan’s 
primary concern was of the inability of a vessel to comply if another RFMO 
changed its binding seabird mitigation measures in a way that they conflicted 
with a new binding measure of the CCSBT.  Instead, Japan suggested that 
CCSBT develop Minimum Performance Requirements (MPRs) for seabird 
mitigation at the earliest opportunity. Japan also noted that it fully recognises the 
importance of bycatch mitigation, and is positively addressing the bycatch 
mitigation through contributing various aspects including hosting the 
Effectiveness of Seabird Mitigation Measures Technical Group (SMMTG) and 
ERSWG, and developing more effective, feasible and economically viable 
mitigation techniques, which are also safer for fishers. 
86. Australia noted that mitigation measures could change at any time within 
RFMOs, and this was not a reason for CCSBT not to proceed with a binding 
seabird measure. 
87. Taking into account concerns expressed by Japan and Taiwan, Australia 
produced a revised draft Resolution for Members’ consideration. 
88. The revised resolution was supported by Australia, Indonesia, Korea, New 
Zealand and the EU.  Taiwan remained concerned that it may find itself in 
contravention of such a binding measure in cases where vessels incidentally take 
SBT as a bycatch.  Taiwan further noted that all its vessels have currently 
implemented other RFMOs’ seabird mitigation measures.  Japan advised that it 
did not see a need for a binding Resolution if all Members are already complying 
with other RFMOs’ ERS measures, which is why it proposed the development of 
a more detailed and comprehensive set of ERS MPRs.   
89. New Zealand noted that the current measures do not seem to be effective as SBT 
vessels catch many seabirds and Australia commented that Japan’s reported 
bycatch of seabirds had increased by approximately 300% between 2012 and 
2013.  Japan responded that this increase had probably occurred due to a nature 
of seabird distribution that may concentrate in some areas and fishing operations 
of one vessel encountered in such an area in 2013.  Japan further noted that this 
was before more stringent mitigation measure had been implemented by ICCAT 
and it hopes that such an anomalous bycatch would decline after implementation 
of ICCAT's revised mitigation measure in July 2013. 
 
90. HSI advised that seabird bycatch mitigation is its key concern with respect to the 
CCSBT.  HSI believes that there is a lack of good faith on the issue, that the SBT 
fishery is now a global concern, and that it is not acceptable that SBT fisheries 
continue to operate as they currently do when improved measures are already 
well known and in common use. HSI further stated that this issue needs to be 
addressed by the implementation of best practice solutions of line weighting and 
night setting, and finally that while there is further technical work that can be 
done to test the effectiveness of mitigation measures, this should not be used as 
an excuse to defer regulatory action now.  
91. It was noted that Members are bound by ERS controls of the other tuna RFMOs 
when fishing in their Convention Areas. 
92. The Chair summarised that there was a strong sense of support for the seabird 
bycatch mitigation measure and that a way should be found to progress this issue. 
93. It was agreed that New Zealand will draft a set of revised ERS MPRS for 
consideration at the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group meeting 
(currently proposed for June 2015), as this will be a Commissioner-level 
discussion.  Most Members considered this to be more appropriate than the 
alternative option of returning the matter to the ERS working group for 
consideration.  The revised MPRs would specify mitigation measures to apply 
when catching SBT in high-risk seabird areas.  Once agreed, the MPRs could be 
sent to the other tuna RFMOs with a request for them to implement those 
measures for the same areas within their Convention Areas. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Cooperating Non-Members 
94. The Chair referred to paper CCSBT-EC/1410/13 on Cooperating Non-Members 
(CNMs). 
95. The meeting confirmed the continuing CNM status of all three existing CNMs: 
the EU, the Philippines, and South Africa for 2015, requesting that: 
• South Africa continue to address any over-catch issues; 
• The EU submit the appropriate CDS documentation to the Secretariat; and 
• The Philippines respond to the questions posed to it by the Compliance 
Committee. 
96. The EU reassured Members that it would be complying further with CDS 
requirements in future.  The EU also provided an update regarding the status of 
its process to become a full Member of the CCSBT, and noted that it intends to 
submit its application by early 2015. 
97. South Africa noted its regret about past over-catches, and drew the meeting’s 
attention to its international status as a responsible fishing nation, which was 
endorsed by the Humane Society International (HSI). 
98. Fiji confirmed its interest in applying to become a CNM of the CCSBT, and its 
application was encouraged and supported by Members. No formal request for 
CNM status has yet been received from Fiji, and it was proposed that Fiji liaise 
with the Executive Secretary concerning application requirements. 
 
99. The request was made that Fiji provide information on the amount of SBT catch, 
type of fisheries, number of fishing vessels involved, and other relevant SBT 
statistical information as part of its application. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
100. The Chair noted paper CCSBT-EC/1410/14 on CCSBT’s relationship with Non-
members that provided background information for this item. 
101. Japan reported on its meeting with China in the margins of the WCPFC meeting 
in December 2013. During the discussions Japan expressed its concern about the 
SBT market potential in China and possible catching of SBT by China. China 
responded that it would investigate this matter if specific information could be 
provided. Japan stated it would like to follow up further on this and asked for 
Members to share information. 
102. The US reiterated that it was glad to be attending the meeting and looked forward 
to continuing to improve on the sharing of data with the CCSBT, and attending 
meetings in the future. 
103. Humane Society International encouraged Members to develop a more 
substantial relationship with all port and market states involved with SBT trade 
as well as those involved in transhipment of SBT, and to have them attend future 
meetings at least as observers or possibly as future CNMs or Members. 
104. The meeting agreed to invite the US, Fiji, and Singapore to CC10 and CCSBT22 
as observers. 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Evaluation of Kobe Process  Recommendations 
105. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/1410/15 on the Kobe 
process, noting that questionnaires on the progress of each of the five tuna 
RFMOs (tRFMOs) towards implementing the various Kobe recommendations 
are provided as an attachment to the paper, and that the USA is the current Kobe 
Steering Committee Chair. 
106. The Executive Secretary asked whether the EC had any preferences regarding the 
future operation of the Kobe process with respect to the operation of the Steering 
Committee, timing of the next full Kobe meeting (if any), and any priorities for 
joint intersessional work, including any items on which the EC may wish to 
accelerate progress. 
107. New Zealand noted that at this meeting Members have the opportunity to 
improve the CCSBT’s rating with regard to adopting a binding measure with 
respect to ERS. 
108. HSI highlighted three Kobe areas it views as a priority: 
• Introduction of mandatory bycatch reporting by CCSBT authorised vessels; 
• Continued progress towards an up-to-date consolidated global list of 
authorised vessels; and 
 
• The importance of States/entities becoming party to the Port State Measures 
Agreement (PSMA). 
109. The USA confirmed that no agreed process or decision had been made on the 
best way to proceed with the Kobe process in future, and that communication 
would be continued by email in the meantime. 
110. The Executive Secretary commented that some peripheral Kobe work is 
occurring as part of the ‘Sustainable Management of Tuna Fisheries and 
Biodiversity Conservation in Areas beyond National Jurisdiction’ (GEF-ABNJ) 
project and sub-projects over the next five years, and that this work is focused on 
developing States.  
111. Paper CCSBT-EC/1410/15 also summarised Kobe recommendations on which 
CCSBT has made little progress to date. It was suggested that work on these 
recommendations could be advanced through the Strategic Plan.  
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
112. The Chair introduced this item which is summarised in the Secretariat’s paper 
CCSBT-EC/1310/17 on activities with other organisations. 
113. The following reports were provided by Members as part of their Observer duties 
for the CCSBT. 
• Korea’s report (CCSBT-EC/1410/26) on the on 10th Annual Meeting of 
WCPFC in Cairns, Australia  between 2 - 6 Dec 2013;  
• Australia’s report (CCSBT-EC/1410/21) on the 32nd Annual Meeting of the 
Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
(CCAMLR) in Hobart, Australia between 23 Oct - 1 Nov 2013;  
• Indonesia’s report (CCSBT-EC/1410/28) on the 18th Session of the Indian 
Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) held in Columbo, Sri Lanka between 1 - 6 
June 2014;  
• Taiwan’s report (CCSBT-EC/1410/27) on the 87th Annual Meeting of the 
Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) held in Lima, Peru 
between 14 -18 July 2014; and  
• Japan’s report (CCSBT-EC/1410/23) on the 23rd Regular Meeting of the 
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in 
Cape Town, South Africa between 18 - 25 November 2013.  Japan noted as 
part of its report the ICCAT have developed technical specifications for 
stereoscopic systems and that these are a mandatory requirement.  This was 
also noted by New Zealand. 
114. It was agreed that the following Members would act as Observers to other 
RFMOs on behalf of CCSBT during 2014/15: 
• Korea to continue as Observer to WCPFC; 
• Australia to continue as an Observer to CCAMLR; 
• Indonesia to continue as Observer to IOTC; 
• Japan to continue as an Observer to ICCAT; and 
 
• Taiwan to continue as an Observer to IATTC. 
115. New Zealand thanked those Members that acted as observers to the above RFMO 
meetings. 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Confidentiality of Data and Documents 
15.1.   Confidentiality of reports and documents from 2014 
116. The Chair introduced paper CCSBT-EC/1410/17 (Rev.2) on the confidentiality 
of reports and documents submitted as meeting documents during 2014.   
117. The Extended Commission noted that with the exception of Attachment A of the 
Secretariat’s paper CCSBT-ESC/1409/04, Australia’s paper CCSBT-
ESC/1409/12 and CCSBT-CC/1410/Info02, Japan’s paper CCSBT-CC/1410/19, 
and Indonesia’s QAR report, the reports of meetings and documents submitted to 
meetings under the jurisdiction of CCSBT20 would be made publicly available. 
118. New Zealand commented that the issue of confidentiality should be considered in 
the strategic planning process that the concept of a defined timeframe for 
confidentiality could be considered. 
 
Agenda Item 16. 
Meeting for 2015 
119. It was agreed that the following meetings and dates would apply for 2015: 
• The 11th ERS Working Group meeting, in Tokyo, Japan. The tentative date is 
March 2015 and is to be discussed intersessionally;  
• Operating Model Structure technical meeting, in Incheon, South Korea from

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa.  
On behalf of the Australian delegation I would like to extend our greetings to the 
Chair, to each of the delegations, to the Secretariat and to the observers at this 
meeting. 
I particularly wish to thank our host, the New Zealand Government, for the warm 
welcome to Auckland and for arranging the visit to the Waitakere Ranges.  
We also thank the Secretariat for its hard work in preparing for these meetings. As 
always, the high quality of the Secretariat’s work has helped all of us to arrive here 
today ready to discuss the issues of most importance to the Commission. 
From Australia’s perspective, our accomplishments this week will include a 
consensus decision to confirm the global total allowable catch for 2016 and 2017. I 
welcome the Extended Scientific Committee’s advice that we should continue to 
follow the Management Procedure as formulated. The Management Procedure 
remains one of the Commission’s biggest achievements and I am pleased that it is 
continuing to support rebuilding of the southern bluefin tuna stock.  
There has also been good news in stock status, with the biomass of fish aged 10 years 
or more having increased from five to seven per cent.  
On these bases, I look forward to confirming our 2013 decision on the total allowable 
catch and turning our focus to the future of the Commission.  
This year we should be focused on planning¬–ensuring that the Commission is in an 
even better position to meet future challenges by addressing the recommendations of 
the second Performance Review, developing new Strategic and Compliance Action 
plans and putting in place arrangements to ensure sustainable long term funding for 
science and research.  
The Scientific Committee has asked us to urgently turn our minds to unaccounted 
sources of southern bluefin tuna mortality. We must look at what is required to better 
understand and then quantify all sources of mortality, so that the Commission can 
then consider how best to address this issue.  
Australia is already leading this work by developing a methodology for accurately 
quantifying recreational catch of southern bluefin tuna. We encourage other members 
to begin taking similar steps and we look forward to working together to collect more 
information, including from markets, to help us develop better estimations to include 
in the 2017 review of the Management Procedure. 
I thank those members that have undertaken Quality Assurance Reviews along with 
Australia this year. The theme emerging from the 2014 findings is, again, that we can 
continue to do more to improve certainty of catch information.  
In particular we thank Indonesia for providing its report and look forward to 
discussing ways to support Indonesia in implementing its national allocation, so that 
we can continue to improve our confidence in the way we adhere to allocations.  
Australia looks forward to Japan and New Zealand’s completion of the phase two 
QAR process, so that we can begin comprehensively and collectively addressing the 
reviews’ recommendations. 
Our accomplishments this week should also include the adoption of a binding 
measure to reduce the impact of fishing for southern bluefin tuna on seabirds. I want 
to leave this meeting on Thursday knowing that the CCSBT is no longer falling 
behind the international standard for seabird bycatch mitigation and that it can begin 
working on effective measures for other ecologically related species, including sharks.  
Australia has stayed strongly committed to this issue and has worked hard to bring the 
Commission up to the standard of other regional fisheries management organisations. 
This year, we have provided a revised resolution that complements and harmonises 
with the obligations imposed by other RFMOs. It is a strong and carefully crafted 
proposal that will help to reduce the impact of fishing on seabirds and, in my view, 
members cannot avoid taking this step for any longer. It is time for the Commission to 
take action to meet the international standard for mitigating seabird bycatch. 
I also hope that this week will see the adoption of a stronger transhipment measure 
that includes in-port transhipment and is harmonised with the CCSBT Catch 
Documentation Scheme (CDS). Each member has put significant effort into revising 
the transhipment measure, including at last week’s Compliance Committee meeting. 
Finally, I again note the opportunity we have this year to plan ahead. We should 
continue the gains made in the Performance Review by setting in place a new 
Strategic Plan and Compliance Action Plan that address the review’s 
recommendations and we should look ahead to determine the scientific work and 
funding we need to ensure that the Management Procedure continues to be supported 
by the best available science.  
In closing, let me again thank our hosts and all attendees, and reiterate Australia’s 
intent to work hard and work cooperatively to ensure that the Extended Commission 
meets its objectives this week and remains in good stead to continue providing for the 
sustainability of the southern bluefin tuna stock. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen, Good 
morning. 
On behalf of Taiwan delegation, I would like to extend our appreciation to our host, 
the New Zealand Government for the very warm welcome to the beautiful harbor in 
its largest city, Auckland and arrangements for a very special excursion with the 
Muriwai beach of sighting the gannet breeding colonies, the scenic Waitakere Ranges 
Regional Park, and the excellent lunch yesterday. Our delegates all enjoyed it very 
much.  
My thanks also go to Mr. Kennedy, the Executive Secretary and the staffs of the 
Secretariat for preparing such completed meeting documents and making efforts on 
the meeting arrangements. I would also like to welcome the representatives of the 
South Africa and the European Union as Cooperating Non-Member as well as 
observers from the United States of America, Fiji, the Human Society International, 
and TRAFFIC. 
The Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) conducted a full stock assessment in the 
last month. After last 5 years’ reducing Total Allowable Catch (TAC) by members, 
although the stock remains at a very low state estimated to be 9% of the initial 
Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) and below the level to produce maximum sustainable 
yield (MSY), there has been some improvement since the 2011 stock assessment and 
fishing mortality is below the level associated with MSY.  
However, from the ESC report it appears that significant levels of unaccounted 
mortality may have occurred which were not considered in the design of the 
Management Procedure (MP). We also noted the ESC’s advice as a matter of urgency, 
to take steps to quantify all sources of unaccounted SBT mortality and to ensure 
adherence to its TAC.  
For the purpose of reaching the interim stock rebuilding target, we need to do our best 
to collect all available SBT mortality information. Quantifying all sources of 
unaccounted SBT mortality is quite challenging for us, but I think making the 
common definition of the attributable catch is the first step needed to be taken. 
Besides, to implement the related monitoring, control, and surveillance (MCS) 
measures is also vital. With exception of the current MCS measures adopted by the 
Extended Commission (EC), such as Catch documentation scheme (CDS), Vessel 
Monitoring System (VMS) and transshipment at sea program, we have reached 
consensus on a new transshipment resolution to include in port transshipment last 
week. In addition, we are now discussing Port State Measures which is very effective 
in combating IUU fishing activities. As for Ecologically Related Species issues, we 
should consider the harmonization with the related tuna Regional Fisheries 
Management Organizations (RFMO). 
 
In closing, I look forward to working with all members and co-operating non-
members in the following days to achieve positive outcomes for the SBT fishery. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Thank you Chair for the floor 
And good morning distinguished delegates 
  
Firstly, On behalf of Indonesia Government, we would like to extend our appreciation 
to New Zealand Government for hosting this important Commission Meeting. We 
also thank you very much for great field trip yesterday, we really enjoy it.  At the 
same time, we also would like to express similar appreciation to Executive Secretary 
of CCSBT and his entire staff, who have made a good effort to well prepare of this 
meeting.  
Distinguished delegates, 
I would like to take this opportunity to share our concern in SBT fisheries that having 
managed by quota regime since 2008. Since this is the first experience for Indonesia 
involved in this quota regime, we understand that, we are remain having a potential 
non-compliance issues particularly to control number of catch.  But on the other side, 
by having a lesson-learned at least for 5 years, we have been able to initiate a 
development strategies in strengthening our management regime. By this 
development, we believe, Indonesia will be able to provide a proper contribution to 
support the achievement of our goal under this organization. 
Distinguished delegates, 
SBT is considered as bycatch in our tuna longline fisheries. There are about 800 
fishing vessels may be involved in this fisheries, consist of 2 (two) categories in size, 
namely vessel >30 GT about 440 vessels and <30 GT about 360 vessels. Most of 
vessels > 30 GT have been included in the CCSBT Record of Vessel Authorized to 
Fish for SBT, but vessels <30 GT, were only registered since 2013 due to mis-
understanding to the resolution. I may inform the meeting that number of Indonesia 
longliner vessels that have been included in the CCSBT Record of Vessel Authorized 
to Fish for SBT by 2013 (1 January – 31 December) were 550 vessels  consist of 
vessel >30 GT : 386 units and vessel < 30 GT : 164 units,  while by 2014 (1 January – 
5 October) are 498 vessels  consist of vessel >30 GT : 336 units  and vessel < 30 : 162 
units.  
Distinguished delegates, 
We understand that over-quota has been occurred since 2011-2013, and it might be 
happened in 2014. We also understand that during the process of quota allocation to 
CCSBT members, Indonesia could not present a real picture of its SBT fisheries.  We 
believe that this is a source of the over-quota issue in Indonesia.  For this reason, 
Indonesia has submitted and presented a proposal to re-visit its national quota to the 
20th CCSBT Commission Meeting last year.  In line with this proposal, we agreed to 
conduct QAR Phase-1 and Phase-2 for Indonesia by 2014. In fact, that QAR findings 
may reflect the reality of Indonesia SBT fisheries.  
Distinguished delegates, 
While there is over-quota issue within 5 years, we have been trying to do our best to 
strengthen our cooperation with fishing industries as well as artisanal fisheries that 
may be involved in this SBT fisheries. We have been able to undertake a better catch 
data collecting system and we believe that the increase of our catch was largely due to 
improve data collection and reporting system of the catch, rather than actual increase 
in catch and number of fleets.  We also have developed a national policy in 
distribution of national quota that will take effect by 2015. To support an effective 
control mechanism to this quota regime, we have developed a land-based CDS 
system. In this regards, on-line system will be used for validation of CDS documents 
by 2015.   
Distinguished delegates, 
To avoid further over-quota issue in the future, we have distributed Indonesia national 
quota to fishing companies through 3 (three) associations based on the national policy. 
Under this policy, each association should submit to government a list of companies 
and its individual quota, as well as vessels name (>30 GT) authorized to fish for SBT. 
Association has to submit such information by 1 November each year, to enable us to 
finalize the uploading all information into CDS system before a new fishing year.   
In this regard, our challenge is, there is no SBT quota for vessels <30 GT (artisanal 
vessel) has been allocated.  The reason is due to national quota is considered too small 
compared to number of vessels involved. In other side, we need to accommodate their 
interest to enable us to control them. 
In relation to artisanal issue, we have done our best to encourage them to be a member 
of association. We believe by becoming a member of association, the government will 
be easier to communicate and to work with them. They have shown a positive 
response by joining the association since October 2013.  
Distinguished delegates, 
By giving explanation of the situation of SBT fisheries in Indonesia, we would like to 
reiterate and request the commission meeting consideration to our proposal to re-visit 
Indonesia national quota as we have submitted last year. We really need to get 
artisanal vessels (<30 GT) on our board support their live and to avoid the increase of 
an uncounted mortality in the future.  As Indonesia government has done its best to 
approach and encourage them to work with us, we further need understanding and 
support from this extended commission by providing them a quota allocation. 
Distinguished Delegates, 
I very much appreciate if this Commission Meeting may consider Article 8 Para 4 (c) 
of the CCSBT Convention stipulated that “in deciding upon allocations amongst the 
Parties under para 3, the commission shall consider the interest of Parties through 
whose exclusive economic of fishery zones southern bluefin tuna migrates”.  
In relation to that, I am very pleased to inform the meeting that artisanal vessels 
catching SBT within Indonesia Exclusive Economic Zone where southern bluefin 
tuna migrates. 
Thank you very much

Opening Statement by Japan 
 
Good morning.  I would like to say a few words on behalf of the Japanese delegation. 
First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to New Zealand for 
hosting the 21st Annual Commission Meeting in this beautiful harbor city of 
Auckland. In the fresh air of spring, I have been enjoying my stay here. The scenery 
from this venue in which many cruisers go by is also entertaining our eyes. Yesterday, 
I also participated in the activity day kindly offered by the New Zealand Government. 
We had a precious opportunity to watch gannet colony, and enjoyed scenery of county 
side and fabulous lunch. I would express my sincere gratitude to New Zealand for the 
memorable activity day. I would like to also thank Mr. Kennedy and the Secretariat 
staff for their work in organizing this meeting, as well as the interpreters who do a 
wonderful job every time. 
During the past several years, CCSBT has experienced big changes. The most 
important accomplishment should be the TAC determinations based on the 
Management Procedure. I believe that the 2nd round of TAC determination calculated 
by the MP last year was an important step forward to launch the MP into a firm orbit.  
Japan also has experienced big changes internally including introduction of the 
individual quota system and a series of MCS measures for ensuring compliance 
thereto, such as catch tags and landing inspections with full coverage, since a few 
years before the adoption of MP  
The Extended Scientific Committee held here in Auckland confirmed that the stock 
status of SBT remains at a very low level, however there has been improvement since 
previous stock assessment conducted in 2011. It is encouraging for all of us who have 
endeavoured to manage the SBT stock that the stock has started to rebuild.   
However, we are facing a big challenge of unaccounted mortality. This problem looks 
new, but it includes longstanding issues, such as uncertainty in the surface fishery 
sector and recreational fishing, which have not been adequately addressed although 
the existence of them has been suggested for long time.  We have to move forward 
from this situation.  Each member must make best effort to assess the scale of 
unaccounted mortality related to its fisheries and to take next steps in a responsible 
manner. I expect constructive discussion in this regard during this meeting. 
We have a full agenda again at this meeting. There may be plenty of difficult items 
but I hope cooperative spirit and sincere dialogue in good faith will make this meeting 
a fruitful meeting.   
Thank you.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Tena koutou, tënä koutou, tënä koutou katoa. Nga mihi nui ki a koutou 
On behalf of the New Zealand delegation I would like to welcome the Chairs, the 
Secretariat, our colleagues from other delegations and observers at this meeting and 
we hope that you are able to find the time to enjoy some of the delights of our largest 
city while you are here.  It has been our pleasure to host this year’s meetings and 
reciprocate the generous hospitality provided by other members in the past. 
As always, New Zealand looks forward to further constructive dialogue on the 
important business of this Commission but we are also keen to see progress on some 
key issues and resolution of some of the issues that seem to have engaged this 
Commission in endless debate in the past. 
New Zealand remains seriously concerned about the status of the southern bluefin 
stock and we reiterate our view that we need to be cautious in our approach to its 
management. While we remain committed to the management procedure adopted by 
this Commission we are of the view that there is good reason to believe that some of 
its underlying assumptions are clearly wrong.  We will hear of the potential 
implications at this meeting and we look forward to the presentation from the Chair of 
the Extended Scientific Committee in this regard. 
New Zealand continues to advocate that as a matter of principal, all southern bluefin 
tuna mortalities including recreational catch and discards should be counted against 
the national allocations to which they relate.   
Members of this Commission have made a commitment to commence this process in 
2015. Perfection is not required before this process can start.  We need to avoid 
prevarication and press on using the best information available to us and do this in a 
concerted fashion.  Not to do so will continue to create risk to the stock and it’s 
rebuilding with considerable foregone yield from the fishery as a result. Inaction also 
has the potential to create significant issues of equity within the Commission. 
We need to heed the advice from our scientists that it is critical that members remain 
within their national allocations.  It is also apparent that we also need to commence 
the process of collectively quantifying and allowing for non-member catches of 
southern bluefin tuna and providing opportunities for new entrants to the Commission 
in the future. 
It is clear that there are identifiable and significant risks to the rebuilding process that 
members have worked hard to achieve.  The challenge is how we as a Commission 
respond and maintain our reputation as a credible regional management organisation.  
Cooperation and transparent information exchange will assist us in meeting this 
challenge. 
Thank you

Opening Statement by Republic of Korea 
 
Mr. Chair,  
Distinguished delegates from Members, Cooperating Non-members and Observers,  
On behalf of the Korean delegation, I would like to extend my gratitude to the New 
Zealand government for hosting this meeting here in this beautiful city of Auckland 
with great hospitality. I also thank Executive Secretary, Mr. Bob Kennedy and his 
team for facilitating the meeting so efficiently. And my appreciation should go to the 
SC chair and the CC chair for your excellent chairmanship dealing with very difficult 
work. 
First of all, I would like to express my appreciation to the CCSBT for its efforts for 
the sustainable use and conservation of the southern bluefin tuna, including its 
ecosystem. And I hope to see this year that the commission would make an orther 
meaningful step toward its urgent goals for rebuilding stock and conservation of its 
ecosystem through the best practices in science and MCS. 
In this line, it should be noted that, according to the Scientific Committee report, there 
has been some improvement in stock assessment for the southern bluefin tuna in terms 
of biomass and probability of reaching rebuilding target. In the meantime, concerns 
are raised on the levels of unaccounted mortality that may hamper the probability of 
rebuilding target under the MP. This is an issue to be imminently addressed so as to 
eliminate uncertainties around data and to assess the impact of these on the operation 
of management procedure for the southern bluefin tuna. 
As for data, the scientific data reporting, scientific observation, ERS data and catch 
documentation scheme are major advances but continue to be improved. 
Implementation of Quality Assurance Review is the strength of the CCSBT 
management policy. Conducting Attributable SBT catch is the most pioneering steps 
toward addressing uncertainty around data, analysis and measures, the first time 
among RFMOs. 
Korea has strengthened its role as a responsible distant water fishing nation by 
amending the Distant Water Fisheries Development Act (effective as from Jan. 1, 
2014) since 2013, whereby the level of punishment for IUU fishing activities Korean 
government has increased up to an imprisonment of up to 3 years or a criminal fine of 
up to 3 times of the amount of the values of illegal catches. Fisheries Monitoring 
Center was established to monitor Korean-flagged vessels fishing in distant waters 
through VMS every one hour since 23 May 2014. The catch statistics are being cross-
checked with logbooks and observer reports compiled by the National Fisheries 
Research and Development Institute, catch documents issued by the National 
Fisheries Quality Management Service and VMS monitored by Fishery Monitoring 
Center. Landing and import/export certificates of catches are issued after collating 
logbook and VMS data.   
A lot of issues regarding conservation of stock and its ecosystem and fisheries are on 
the table of CCSBT 21 this year. I hope all Members and Cooperating Non-members 
should pool our strengths and wisdom together to draw fruitful results at this meeting.  
Again, I would like to thank all of you who are involved in the work of this great 
organization.

Opening Statement by European Union 
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
First of all, I would like to thank New Zealand for hosting this meeting in the seaborn 
city of Auckland. The European Union is very pleased to be present at the annual 
meeting of the CCSBT. 
Let me take the opportunity to inform you on the reform of the EU’s Common 
Fisheries Policy (CFP) which applies since 1 January 2014. This new policy includes 
a strong external dimension which bases its action for fisheries outside Union waters 
on the same standards and principles as for internal fisheries.  
Although our importance in CCSBT is limited, globally the EU is a major player as a 
producer and as the world’s largest importer of fish and fish products. The EU has 
vessels in all oceans and consumes about 25 % of the world’s fish resources in value, 
and imports 70 % of its consumption. However, 85 % of the world’s fish resources are 
either fully exploited or overexploited, according to assessments. The EU feels 
therefore compelled to act responsibly and reverse this trend on all levels, including in 
RFMOs.  
Accordingly, the EU promotes strengthening the overall performance of RFMOs as 
key bodies for ocean governance, in particular by better science and more compliance.  
RFMO objectives for sustainable fisheries management can only be achieved by 
basing management decisions on scientific advice that allows to achieve maximum 
sustainable yield (MSY) and is anchored in an ecosystem - and precautionary 
approach to fisheries management. Eradication of IUU fishing is another major strand 
of the EU’s external dimension in fisheries.  
More specifically, as the CCSBT is concerned, we intend therefore to be actively 
involved also in CCSBT activities. Consequently we will continue to make efforts to 
ensure the highest standards, in particular in relation to CDS implementation, a matter 
that we take very seriously.  
Finally, the EU would like to thank Members of this Commission for modifying the 
CCSBT rules in order to allow the EU to strengthen its participation in CCSBT to full 
membership of the Extended Commission. We confirm our interest and in this regard, 
the necessary legal steps have been taken in order to advance with the official request 
for membership to the Extended Commission in the coming months.  
We look forward to participating in this meeting and hope it will be a productive and 
successful.

Opening Statement by South Africa 
 
Chairperson, Distinguished Delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 
On behalf of the Republic of South Africa, we would like to express our gratitude to 
the Government of New Zealand for gracious hospitality extended to us and for the 
hosting the 21st Annual meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) in this beautiful city of Auckland. Also to compliment the 
Secretariat for the brilliant work done in putting together such a successful meeting in 
this beautiful venue. 
Allow us Chairperson to extend our sincere apologies for failure of South Africa to 
attend the 20th Annual Meeting of the Commission which was held in Adelaide, 
Australia. It was not due to lack of want but it is due budgetary constraints experience 
as our country was preparing for its fourth democratic elections. 
Chairperson, I would like to refer the Commission back to our opening statement in 
2012 where we indicated that, I quote “The proposed increase, upon accession, in 
South Africa’s quota for 2013 and 2014 was substantially lower than what South 
African delegation was mandated to request. Our principals view the proposed 
increase as not being economically viable for South Africa as a developing range 
state. This minimal increase does not recognize South Africa as one of the only four 
range states with SBT occurring in its waters. Furthermore, this decision by member 
parties does not adequately acknowledge the sovereign right of South Africa under 
UNCLOS as a coastal state to harvest marine resources occurring within the EEZ. The 
view of our principals is that we as South Africa have done more than is necessary to 
co-operate with CCSBT, but the co-operation by its members has not been adequately 
acknowledged, and neither are the benefits of accession clear under the proposed 
current quota allocation. South Africa’s co-operation is clearly evident in the 
measures implemented to manage its small bluefin allocation, including but not 
limited to; mandatory VMS for all vessels, largest on board scientific observer 
programme of all CCSBT parties, on board logbooks, electronic landing summaries, 
and independent monitoring of all landings and transshipments in port. Moreover, 
South Africa at its own cost has voluntarily implemented Port State Measures to 
specifically monitor and manage bluefin landed and transshipped by foreign vessels 
using our ports. Given the above, our principals are still debating the merits of South 
Africa’s accession to CCSBT”. South Africa continues to experience difficulties in 
managing the small allocation which often has unintended consequences not properly 
aligned with the objectives of the Commission. 
Chairperson, South Africa commenced with the process of accession in 2013. The 
accession was supported and approved by cabinet last August and the Minister 
requested the tabling thereof to the National Assembly in March 2014. However, the 
matter couldn’t be tabled for adoption due to busy election schedule. With new 
government in place, the department had to restart the whole process and the matter is 
presently in the last hurdle (Portfolio Committee) and from there it will go to the 
National Assembly for adoption. We expect the process to be finished before the end 
of the year. To that end, South African intends to apply for the renewal of its Co-
operating, Non-Contracting status at the 21st Annual meeting of the Commission. 
We would like to assure you that as a cooperating non-contracting member, South 
Africa is committed to complying with the requirements and management measures 
established by the commission. Whilst we try the best within our means, we 
acknowledge that recently we have experienced some challenges in respect to timeous 
submission of some necessary reports. We have lost two Fisheries Managers who 
have been responsible for managing this fishery. Processes are underway to fill the 
two vacancies although it will take some time to develop the expertise and replace 
capacity. 
We are hoping that the 21st Annual meeting of the Commission will positively 
consider South Africa’s application for the renewal of its Co-operating, Non-
Contracting status and the furthermore, the Secretariat’s support while developing 
new capacity to manage this fishery.

Opening Statement by Fiji 
 
The Chairman, the Executive Secretary, Delegates of Member Countries, Co-
operative Non- Members, Observer States, Organisations representatives, Ladies and 
Gentlemen. 
A big BULA Vinaka and Good Morning to ALL. 
First of all, on behalf of the newly elected Government of Fiji, I would like to 
acknowledge and thank the host Country New Zealand for their friendliness and warm 
welcome we have received. Also Fiji would like to extend its thankfulness to the 
Executive Secretary for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna for inviting Fiji as 
an Observer to CCSBT 21 meeting. 
Fiji as in the past years has expressed its interest in becoming a Co-operative Non-
Member of the Extended Commission. The Southern Boarder to Fijis Exclusive 
Economic Zone (EEZ) has a large block of High Seas that extends to the Northern 
Boarder of New Zealand’s EEZ. Some of Fiji’s Fishing Vessels do fish in this High 
Seas block; targeting Albacore Tuna and occasionally catch South Bluefin Tuna. 
Fiji’s commitment to the Regional Tuna Fisheries Management is advocated by Fiji 
Government in 2013 approving an Offshore Fisheries Management Decree with 
objectives to conserve, manage and develop Fiji fisheries to ensure long term 
sustainable use for the benefit of the people of Fiji and the provision application of 
conservation and management measures adopted by a regional fisheries management 
organisation. 
Fiji is looking forward and contented to cooperate with all Commission member 
Countries in strengthening our relations and to help ensure the ongoing sustainability 
of this commercially important fishery. 
 With respect, on behalf of the Government of Fiji I would request the Commission to 
consider the status and request of Fiji; to become a Cooperating Non-Member in the 
near future. 
I do look forward to observe and gain as much from this meeting and pray that it will 
be a very productive and successful meeting.  
Thank You.

Opening Statement by the United States of America 
 
I would like to begin by again thanking the Government of New Zealand for hosting 
this meeting and both New Zealand and the Secretariat for the excellent meeting 
arrangements.  The United States would also like to express its appreciation to 
Members for extending the invitation to attend the 9th Meeting of the Compliance 
Committee and 21st Meeting of the Extended Commission.  This is the first time that 
the United States has been able to attend a CCSBT meeting, and we hope this will 
mark the beginning of increased cooperation with CCSBT and its Members.   
IUU Fishing has been recognized as a major problem globally. This summer President 
Obama established a Presidential Task Force to Combat Illegal, Unreported and 
Unregulated Fishing and Seafood Fraud.   The Interagency Task Force is directed to 
report to the President in December 2014 with “recommendations for the 
implementation of a comprehensive framework of integrated programs to combat IUU 
fishing and seafood fraud that emphasizes areas of greatest need.”  International 
cooperation is critical to ensure that the global seafood supply is safe, healthy, and 
legally harvested, and the United States continues to seek the help of its international 
partners in these efforts.  
I want to congratulate the CCSBT on the completion of its second performance 
review and encourage the Extended Commission to implement those 
recommendations.  The United States also encourages the CCSBT to continue 
working to implement the recommendations from the Kobe process, as well as adopt 
binding mitigation measures for seabirds.   In the future, we also hope to see progress 
on the adoption of port State measures and requiring ILO numbers for all eligible 
large-scale vessels. 
The United States looks forward to examining opportunities to improve information 
exchange with regard to implementation of the CDS program, and we will work 
intersessionally with the Secretariat to determine the what information we can provide 
given our confidentiality limits.  The United States is very open to other areas for 
collaboration, and I look forward to exploring those with you this week. 
 
Attachment 6 – 3 
 
Opening Statement by Humane Society International 
 
Humane Society International would like to thank the Commission for the opportunity 
to participate as an observer to these important deliberations. You will recall that, at 
both CCSBT19 & 20, we commented that, with agreement of the Management 
Procedure for SBT, comes the opportunity for Members to focus on the bycatch of 
Ecologically Related Species and to decide on a path to reduce the impacts of SBT 
fishing on these non-target species, especially albatross and petrel species nesting on 
sub-Antarctic islands in the CCAMLR Area.  
• We consider that any possible TAC increases based on the Management 
Procedure should be deferred until effective and enforceable ERS bycatch 
measures are in place – while the Scientific Committee might consider the 
TAC can be increased without significantly harming stock recovery prospects, 
any increase in longline fishing effort will kill more seabirds - remember that, 
on average, for every two tonnes of SBT TAC increase for longliners, about 
one more albatross will be killed. 
• We remain disappointed that CCSBT has not adopted a seabird bycatch 
mitigation measure as have the four other tuna RFMOs and we urge Members 
to adopt such a measure, based on the Australian proposal, at this meeting. 
• We remain disappointed that Members have yet to include comprehensive 
ERS mortality data collection provisions in the CCSBT scientific observer 
protocol which seriously undermines the ability of the Commission to make 
precise mortality estimates based on available data. 
• We are likewise concerned at the low and variable level of scientific observer 
coverage on CCSBT authorized vessels and we urge the Commission to adopt 
a programme of upgrading not only to immediately improve collection of 
ERS-related data but also to expand the coverage to 25% of fishing effort 
within three years – and any failure of individual owners and/or national fleets 
to meet their observer coverage commitments should result in the exclusion of 
their vessels from the CCSBT authorized vessel list. 
• We are disappointed that the seabird bycatch measures adopted by the other 
tuna RFMOs do not include reporting and monitoring arrangements to allow 
compliance and effectiveness to be readily evaluated – and we hope that 
CCSBT will adopt a measure that includes provisions for both effectiveness 
and compliance evaluation.  
• We would like to suggest that this be done by requiring annual notification of 
fishing vessels to the CCSBT list of authorized vessels and that such 
notifications include declarations that appropriate gear is on board to allow all 
three mitigation arrangements to be used – we are particularly keen to ensure 
that authorized longline vessels carry gear that complies with line weighting 
requirements and that this can be a matter for port inspections at the start and 
finish of fishing trips. 
• Furthermore, we suggest that log books must be kept not only to identify, for 
each gear set, what mitigation arrangements were used but also to identify how 
many of what species of ERS were killed or harmed as a result of that same set 
and that this data must be made available for use by the Compliance 
Committee, Extended Scientific Committee and ERS-Working Group as soon 
as practicable. 
• Regarding SBT target stock, we are disappointed at the failure of 
intersessional work to deliver actual estimates for all unaccounted sources of 
SBT catch mortality.  We commend the Extended Scientific Committee in 
urging the Extended Commission to fix this gap as a matter of urgency.  This 
should be done immediately, using best estimates that properly reflect 
inevitable uncertainty, while prioritizing ongoing work to improve future 
estimates – so that an improved stock assessment methodology, based on all 
sources of SBT mortality, can be adopted next year.   
• Meanwhile, it’s time to declare ‘extraordinary circumstances’ and suspend any 
TAC increases under the new Management Procedure - as the precautionary 
principle tells us: lack of information should not be used as an excuse to delay 
necessary action. 
Thank you Chair and Members for your time. 
Attachment 6 – 4 
 
Opening Statement by TRAFFIC and WWF 
 
Thank you Mr. Chairman. 
TRAFFIC and WWF thank the Commission for the opportunity to participate as 
observers to meetings of the Commission, Extended Commission and its other 
subsidiary bodies. We look forward to contributing to these critical deliberations.   
The Management Procedure (MP) adopted in 2011 has an interim rebuilding target of 
20% of the original spawning biomass by 2035, and sets out to achieve that target 
with 70% probability. 
However, this is an interim target. We ask the Commission to therefore define the 
long-term biologically safe target of rebuilding for the Southern Bluefin tuna stock 
with the Precautionary Principle in mind. We recognise the importance of tuning the 
MP with the long-term target, especially as the annual Total Allowable Catch (TAC) 
has been increased recently. At the same time, the stock is estimated to be at a very 
low level – approximately 9% of the initial Spawning Stock Biomass, which is well 
below the level required to produce maximum sustainable yield. 
Unaccounted mortalities remain an important issue due to under-reporting by 
members, as well as other factors including discarding and live release, non-member 
catch and recreational catch. This undermines the integrity and comprehensiveness of 
the stock assessment model and the credibility of the outcomes of the management 
procedure and TAC setting process.  
To address this, we welcome the Commission’s effort to institute a common definition 
of the Attributable SBT Catch and urge Members to agree to account for all 
mortalities in this fishery so that any future non-compliance could thus be considered 
to be IUU catch and therefore would be dealt with appropriate levels of serious 
attention.  
Upon reflecting on the Scientific Committees report and the possible amount of 
unaccounted mortalities, we consider this to be of such concern that it should trigger 
the “exceptional circumstances” procedure. We believe this should result in revisiting 
the MP due to concerns that lack of mortality data being fed in to the MP has resulted 
in it guiding the setting of TACs that are in excess of what would allow for the interim 
rebuilding target to be met. 
We also encourage the Commission to determine the future allocation for any new 
entrants to the Commission. This should make it clear to any current non-cooperating 
fishing countries that the longer they remain outside the Convention, the less will be 
their allocation when they decide to cooperate. These steps are necessary to remove 
the incentive to building catch history outside of existing Conventions as a tactic to 
gain a larger proportion of the quota when a decision is taken to join.  
With respect to Ecologically Related Species (ERS), we note the importance of 
assessing the results of the stock assessment for the Southern Hemisphere population 
of Porbeagle shark which will be shared at the ERS Working Group next year. Based 
on the result, we encourage the Commission to agree what constitutes levels of catch 
that are sustainable and therefore provide parameters for agreeing non-detriment 
findings that allow for the issuing of CITES permits for trade. 
We urge Members to make the necessary decisions, with the required sense of 
urgency, in order to conserve effectively SBT and other ecologically related species, 
especially sharks, seabirds and marine turtles.  
As a final note to the Commissioners, we ask that this week the Extended 
Commission remains the forum for discussions and decisions so as we can all 
participate and the CCSBT process can be more transparent.  
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Resolution to Establish the Status of Cooperating Non-Member of 
the Extended Commission and the Extended Scientific Committee 
 
(adopted at the Tenth Annual Meeting – 7-10 October 2003, 
updated at the Twenty First Annual Meeting – 13-16 October 2014) 
RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH THE STATUS OF COOPERATING NON-
MEMBER OF THE EXTENDED COMMISSION AND THE EXTENDED 
SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
RECOGNISING that ensuring the sustainability of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) 
stock requires that all those States and entities fishing this species work together 
through the Extended Commission; 
 
CONSIDERING that continued fishing for SBT by States and entities not adhering 
to conservation and management measures adopted in accordance with the 
Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (the Convention) 
substantially diminishes the effectiveness of those measures; 
 
RECOGNISING, in accordance with Article 13 of the Convention and the 
Resolution to establish an Extended Commission and an Extended Scientific 
Committee (the Resolution), the continuing need for all members of the Extended 
Commission to co-operate with each other to encourage States to accede to the 
Convention and to encourage entities to apply for membership of the Extended 
Commission, and  
 
RECOGNISING the continuing need to encourage all non-member States and 
entities whose fishing vessels harvest SBT or through whose exclusive economic or 
fishery zone SBT migrates to take appropriate actions to ensure the effectiveness of 
conservation and management measures and all other decisions adopted in accordance 
with the Convention; 
 
Decides as follows: 
 
1.  The Extended Commission hereby establishes the status of “Cooperating Non-
Member” of the Extended Commission and the Extended Scientific Committee. 
 
2.  The Executive Secretary of the Extended Commission is instructed to invite every 
year all non-member States and entities whose fishing vessels harvest SBT or through 
whose exclusive economic or fishery zone SBT migrates to co-operate with the 
Commission by acceding to the Convention or, as the case requires, by becoming a 
member of the Extended Commission or applying to the Extended Commission for 
the status of a Cooperating Non-Member. 
 
3.  Any State or entity that receives such an invitation may apply to the Extended 
Commission to be admitted in the capacity of a Cooperating Non-Member to the 
Extended Commission. Any applications for such admission should be received by 
the Executive Secretary of the Extended Commission at least one hundred and twenty 
(120) days before the Annual Meeting of the Extended Commission. 
 
4.  When submitting an application for admission in the capacity of a Cooperating 
Non-Member, the candidate State or entity will give a formal written statement to the 
Extended Commission of its commitment to: 
a. 
carry out the objective of the Convention; 
b. abide by conservation and management measures and all other decisions and 
resolutions adopted in accordance with the Convention, including 
compliance with national allocations of the SBT total allowable catch and 
resolutions relating to the Catch Documentation Scheme, transhipment of 
SBT, authorised vessels and farms, list of vessels presumed to have carried 
out IUU fishing for SBT and vessel monitoring systems; 
c. 
take appropriate action to ensure that its fishing activities do not diminish the 
effectiveness of conservation and management measures and all other 
decisions adopted in accordance with the Convention; 
d. transmit to the Extended Commission the review of its SBT fisheries and all 
other data that the members of the Extended Commission are required to 
submit to the Extended Commission each year; 
e. 
facilitate scientific research and studies of SBT; and 
f. 
negotiate with the members of the Extended Commission to develop any 
other criteria for its admission in the capacity of a Cooperating Non-Member 
specific to its situation. 
 
5.  In deciding upon a total allowable catch and its allocation the Extended 
Commission may negotiate catch limits for Cooperating Non-Members.  Cooperating 
Non-Members shall abide by any negotiated limit.  
 
6.  The commitments in paragraph 4(a) to (e), and any specific criteria determined by 
the Extended Commission in negotiation with the applicant in accordance with 4(f), 
will form the basis of an Exchange of Letters between the applicant and the Extended 
Commission.  Upon conclusion of the Exchange of Letters the applicant will be 
admitted in the capacity of a “Cooperating Non-Member” of the Extended 
Commission.  The Cooperating Non-Member will reaffirm the commitments 
contained in the Exchange of Letters at the Annual Meetings of the Extended 
Commission. 
 
7.  A State or entity that is admitted to the Extended Commission in the capacity of a 
Cooperating Non-Member will have the right to participate actively in meetings of the 
Extended Commission, the Extended Scientific Committee and their subsidiary 
bodies, including, but not limited to, the right to make proposals and the right to 
speak, but not to vote.  The Extended Commission may decide to restrict the 
participation of a Cooperating Non-Member in a particular agenda item. 
 
8.  At its Annual Meeting the Extended Commission will determine whether the State 
or entity qualifies to retain the status of Cooperating Non-Member.  The Extended 
Commission will evaluate the performance of the Cooperating Non-Member against 
the commitments set out in its Exchange of Letters with the Extended Commission. 
 
9.  If the Extended Commission determines that a Cooperating Non-Member has not 
fulfilled its commitments the Extended Commission may proceed in accordance with 
the 2000 Action Plan, or take other appropriate steps. 
 
10.  The Executive Secretary is instructed to inform any non-member State or entity 
whose fishing vessels harvest southern bluefin tuna in a manner that undermines the 
conservation and management measures adopted in accordance with the Convention, 
and that does not seek full membership of the Convention, membership of the 
Extended Commission or Cooperating Non-Member status, that continuing to allow 
such activities to take place, undermines the objective of the Convention.  
 
 
Attachment 8 
 
Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
Dr. Kevin Sullivan (New Zealand) agreed to chair the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC). The Chair proposed the following agenda, which was agreed by 
the FAC: 
• Revision of the 2014 budget 
• Discussion of the Scientific Research Programme 
• Draft 2015 budget 
The FAC also discussed the funds provided in the budget each year for “Assistance to 
developing Members and CNMs”. For various reasons this fund has not been used in 
the last few years. 
 
The revised budget for 2014 
The Executive Secretary gave a summary of the 2014 revised budget outlined in 
CCSBTEC/1410/05 that provides savings in all six cost centres of the budget. These 
savings result from a combination of venue deposits being paid in late 2013, reduced 
numbers of participants at meetings and savings on travel, consultancies, contracts, 
translations, catering and exchange rates. 
The FAC noted the recommendation in the CCSBT Performance Review (PR-2014-
59) that a systematic carry-over in the budget was not considered budgetary best 
practice and indicated room for improved planning. However, after discussion of this 
point within the FAC no changes were recommended to the Executive Secretary on 
the level of uncertainty (contingency) to include in the draft budget. The FAC noted 
the major inconvenience that any overspend of the budget would cause the Secretariat 
and the observation that any budget surplus in a year is carried forward to the budget 
of the Commission in the following year in accordance with CCSBT’s Financial 
Regulations. 
A small number of changes to the Revised 2014 budget were proposed by the 
Executive Secretary in the FAC meeting: 
• As there is no requirement this year for the approved budget item “Operating 
Model/Management Strategy Development” this will provide savings of 
$6,100 
• A reduction in the forecasted expenditure for “Assistance to Developing 
States” from $12,500 to $2,800. This will allow sufficient funding for one 
person to attend the Effectiveness of Seabird Mitigation Measures Technical 
Group while providing savings of $9,700. 
• Additional expenditure of $2100 for urgent replacement of a computer (Under 
budget item “Provision for new/replacement assets”) 
 
Final income for 2014 is estimated to be 1.6% higher than the amount approved at 
CCSBT20 for 2014. The slightly increased income is due to a greater return on 
investments than expected (+53.8%) and an increase in the Staff Assessment Levy 
(+5.7%) in the approved budget for 2014.  
The expenditure for 2014 is estimated to be 9.8% lower than the amount approved for 
2014. A surplus of $240,084 is now estimated for 2014, and it is proposed that this 
surplus be carried forward as income into the 2015 budget. The FAC thanked the 
Executive Secretary for the work done on the budget. 
The FAC recommends that the revised budget for 2014 at Annex A be agreed by the 
Extended Commission. 
 
The proposed budget for 2015 
The FAC considered the proposed budget for 2015 as outlined in CCSBT-
EC/1410/06, and also a revision of this prepared by the Executive Secretary. The 
revision included updated estimates of expenditure costs based on decisions made by 
the Extended Commission (EC 21). 
The FAC discussed the cost estimates for a number of budget items and agreed the 
following recommendations on the major budget items: 
• Scientific Research Program Projects ($210,000): The FAC recommends to 
the Extended Commission that the SRP projects proposed by the ESC be 
conducted in 2015, these being: Continued collection of close-kin samples 
($35,000), preparatory work on the review of genotyping techniques for 
Close-Kin research ($85,000), a design study for future gene-tagging 
($75,000) and ageing of otoliths from the Indonesian fishery ($15,000). 
• Quality Assurance Review (QAR) ($35,000): CCSBT 20 agreed that a phase 2 
QAR would be conducted for Japan in 2015. 
• Financial support for maintenance of the ADMB software ($12,400). The FAC 
recommends that the Extended Commission approve financial support for the 
ADMB Foundation for 2015 in maintaining and developing this important 
software, used in the stock assessment modelling.  Future support would be 
subject to an annual decision. 
The FAC also considered the proposed meeting program for 2015. The FAC 
recommends to the Extended Commission, that: 
(i) A two day scientific technical meeting be held immediately prior to the ESC 
meeting, for evaluating possible changes in the Operating Model structure. 
(Cost ~$22,000) 
(ii) The annual meetings of the Extended Scientific Committee, the Compliance 
Committee and Extended Commission be planned and budgeted as proposed 
in CCSBT-EC/1410/06. 
The FAC recommends funding the following items requested by Heads of 
Delegations: 
(i) A three day Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group Meeting at a 
venue in Canberra provided by Australia (cost ~$50,000) 
(ii) Market research for non-Member markets (cost ~$100,000) 
The FAC noted that one member of independent advisory panel has resigned. The 
FAC recommends that the Extended Commission fund a three member Advisory 
Panel in 2015. 
 
Scientific Research Programme (SRP) 
At the request of the FAC the chair of the ESC (Dr John Annala) presented a 
summary of the proposed 3-year SRP. The ESC proposes to continue with Close-Kin 
analysis to allow absolute estimates of spawning biomass to be determined in future 
years. The ESC highlighted the urgent need to review the current methodology and 
invest in newer smarter technology for the future.  In addition the ESC recommended 
that gene-tagging be investigated as a potential method to estimate recruitment to the 
SBT stock. The design phase of this study was deferred by the Commission last year 
due to cost constraints in the budget.  
The cumulative effect of the ESC’s proposed research programme if approved, is to 
substantially increase the cost of research within the Commission’s budget. The SRP 
costs increase to $210,000 in 2015, but are expected to require much larger increases 
in 2016 and 2017, due to ongoing costs of the Close-Kin and Gene-tagging work and 
the addition of a number of smaller one-off research studies. 
 
Funding of scientific aerial survey 
The FAC discussed Australia’s proposal for the Commission to increase funding for 
the scientific aerial survey. It was not able to agree to increase funding for the survey 
work at this time. However, the FAC agreed to recommend to the Extended 
Commission that an amount of $100,000 (excluding GST) be made available in the 
2015 budget to partially fund the aerial survey work (i.e. at the same level as in 2014).  
Australia indicated that they will be seeking increased funding to the aerial survey 
from 2016. 
 
Assistance to developing Members and CNMs 
The FAC agreed that an amount of $12,500 should again be allocated in the 2015 
General Budget to assist developing Members and CNMs by supporting their 
attendance in relevant workshops and to also be used by the Commission to fund 
training and workshops held for developing Members and CNMs. 
The FAC noted difficulties previously experienced by the Secretariat in making use of 
these funds. Developing Members and CNMs can apply intersessionally to use the 
funds and the Secretariat would provide those funds subject to intersessional 
agreement by the Members. The FAC recommends to the Extended Commission that 
in future approval for expenditure for a single representative to attend a CCSBT 
working group meeting of these funds be the responsibility of the Executive Secretary 
to expedite the use of the funds for the purpose intended. 
 
Recommended Budget 2015 
The FAC agreed to recommend the General Budget for the Extended Commission in 
2015 as set out in Annex B to this document. The Extended Commission is asked to 
note that the recommended Budget will result in a 6.2% increase in Member 
contributions.

Recommendations from the 2014 Performance Review of the CCSBT 
Source of 
recommendation 
Original recommendation 
2014 Performance review recommendation  
Sub. 
Body1 
1. Conservation and management 
 
Status of living marine resources 
 
SA-2008-1 
Support best endeavours of 
the ESC to recreate 
historical catch and catch per 
unit of effort series for the 
fishery but give maximum 
priority to accurate reporting 
and validation of future 
catch and effort. 
PR-2014-1: The original recommendation 
remains valid and efforts should continue in the 
same direction.  
PR-2014-2: The compliance with and efficiency 
of the Data Verification procedures should be 
regularly checked. 
ESC 
 
ESC 
PR-2008-1 
Develop stock assessment 
methodologies that are 
robust to past 
underreporting. 
PR-2014-3: The CCSBT ESC should undertake 
from time to time (e.g. every 5-6 years) an 
assessment of the robustness of the assessments, 
e.g. through retrospective analysis, comparing 
past forecasts with subsequent realizations. 
ESC 
PR-2008-2 
Take a precautionary 
approach to management 
and lower the TAC as the 
uncertainty increases. 
PR-2014-4: The recommendation, in its present 
form might be considered as fulfilled as long as 
the MP / Metarule “tandem” function properly 
(See PR-2008-3 on SBT stock rebuilding 
strategy). 
PR-2014-5: In the future, the CCSBT could 
undertake to test the robustness of the MP to 
climate change. It should also take every 
opportunity to give priority to stock rebuilding 
above increasing catch, when exceptional positive 
recruitment spikes occur above the variations 
against which the MP has been tested. 
ESC 
 
 
ESC 
PR-2008-3: 
Determine management 
objectives and rebuild 
strategy consistent with 
UNFSA requirements to 
guide future scientific 
assessments. Set TACs at a 
level that will allow the 
stock to rebuild. 
PR-2014-6: Every effort should be made to 
enhance (speed-up) the rebuilding trajectory in 
line with the precautionary approach to fisheries 
(cf. PR-2008-2). Special efforts should be made 
to identify additional measures (e.g. protected 
areas) to support spawning and recruitment and 
improve resilience to fishing and climate change. 
ESC 
EC 
SA-2008-2 
Make the maximum effort to 
implement the items which 
have been identified and 
prioritised by the Extended 
Scientific Committee in the 
CCSBTs Scientific Research 
Program (Attachment 9 of 
the SC12 Report) 
PR-2014-7: The CCSBT could consider the 
feasibility of a collaborative programme (between 
RFMOs and institutions competent in biodiversity 
conservation) to assess ex ante the likely impacts 
of climate change on the tuna ecosystems, the 
SBT, the ERS, their productivity, distribution and 
resilience. The outcome of this work would 
indicate which ocean parameters could be 
usefully monitored to better inform the Meta Rule 
of the MP Process. 
ESC 
ERS 
                                                            
1 “Sub. Body” suggests the CCSBT subsidiary bodies (ESC, ERS and/or CC) that might be able to provide some 
initial advice to the Extended Commission for its consideration on the relevance and priority of that 
recommendation for the CCSBT.  A “-“ is recorded in cases where no further recommendation has been 
specified.  An empty cell indicates that the neither the ESC, ERS nor CC are appropriate for providing initial 
advice on the recommendation. 
SA-2008-3 
Assess and monitor, directly 
or with other RFMOs, the 
risks and impacts on ERS 
and adopt a mitigation 
strategy. 
PR-2014-8: The CCSBT should specify the 
mitigation strategies for each ERS, area and 
fishery with their objectives (short and long-
term), management and enforcement measures, 
and performance assessment. Considering the 
amount of work this represents, each strategy 
should also specify the order of priority given by 
the CCSBT to the different ERS, areas and 
fisheries, and it should record its rationale for 
these decisions. 
ERS 
SA-2008-4 
To base decisions on 
periodic full assessments of 
the SBT stock and 
establishing a rebuild 
strategy. 
PR-2014-9: It can be considered that the 
recommendation is being implemented and has 
been integrated in the CCSBT best practice. No 
more recommendation needed. 
- 
Data collection and sharing 
 
SA-2008-5 
Develop a strategy to collect 
and share data between 
CCSBT members and 
RFMOs. 
PR-2014-10: Based on the above the original SA 
recommendation might be considered as 
completed. However the PR suggests maintaining 
it as a leading title under which for more specific 
recommendations might be nested as need arise, 
e.g. regarding the SBT catches in recreational and 
artisanal fisheries. 
ESC 
ERS 
SA-2008-6 
Clear standards are to be set 
on the type of data and level 
of detail to be provided by 
members [and cooperating 
non-members], in order to 
ensure the science process 
has the information it 
requires. 
PR-2014-11: More efforts need to be made to 
resolve the data confidentiality (regarding 
observers and operational fishery data) in order to 
improve the resolution and accuracy of the 
assessments and precision of the scientific advice. 
ESC 
ERS 
SA-2008-7 
All members and 
cooperating non-members 
fulfil the UNFSA / Kobe 
requirements regarding 
collection and sharing of 
data (e.g.: Scientific data; 
Observers’ data; ERS data; 
Catch documentation; 
Listing of vessels and farms; 
Transhipment; Data gap-
filling; and data 
confidentiality (SA-2008). 
See also SA-2008-10. 
PR-2014-12: The initial recommendation, as 
formulated, seems to have accomplished its role 
and could be considered as completed and 
replaced, in the future by more specific ones. 
- 
SA-2008-8 
Commercial confidentiality 
should no longer limit the 
access to data within the 
CCSBT. Members should 
make every effort to ensure 
that domestic constraints on 
data provision will not 
undermine the conservation 
and management efforts by 
CCSBT. Members and 
Cooperating Non-Members 
fully comply with the 
confidentiality agreements 
and provisions within the 
CCSBT. 
PR-2014-13: As long as the confidentiality 
problem will hamper the quality of the scientific 
assessment efforts CCSBT should continue to 
improve the accessibility of “confidential” data 
for this purpose, with appropriate safeguards. A 
time limit should be adopted in the data 
confidentiality rules, putting most if not all data in 
the public domain after a given period of time 
sufficient to reduce sufficiently or eliminate any 
risk from its broader use. 
ESC 
ERS 
SAWG-2010 
(Scientific Advice 
Working Group 
(of Kobe II)) 
Range of recommendations 
on data collection and 
sharing. 
PR-2014-14: It is recommended that the SAWG 
recommendations be carefully examined and 
integrated in the data collection and sharing 
agenda. 
ESC 
ERS 
Quality and provision of scientific advice 
 
SA-2008-9 
Achieve a better balance 
between the scientific efforts 
dedicated to SBT on the one 
hand and ERS on the other. 
PR-2014-15: The above recommendation is 
important and is probably a long-term one with 
implications for research but also for 
management. However, because of the 
subjectivity of the concept of balance and its 
potential financial implications, it should be used 
as a “chapeau” and be complemented by more 
specific ones, related to specific species/areas 
requiring more attention. 
ESC 
ERS 
SA-2008-10 
The current structure of the 
Extended Scientific 
Committee, especially, the 
independent chairs and 
advisory panel, should be 
maintained. 
PR-2014-16: No additional recommendation is 
needed regarding the continuing role of the ESC 
Independent Chair and Panel 
- 
SA-2008-11 
In light of the requirement to 
focus on future information 
with which to assess the 
stock status of SBT, the 
number and skill sets of 
independent experts required 
in support of the scientific 
process should be reviewed. 
PR-2014-17: Assess the eventual gaps in 
scientific skills and proceed to fill them through 
recruitment (including of new/ complementary 
profiles in the Independent Panel) and capacity 
building in partner countries. 
ESC 
ERS 
SA-2008-12 
The need for a management 
procedure for the fishery in 
the short term should be 
reconsidered in light of the 
alternative approach of 
periodic stock assessments 
using the agreed operating 
model. 
PR-2014-18: The original recommendation 
should be considered as superseded. No new 
recommendation needed as the MP is now 
integrated in the assessment and advisory tool box 
of the Commission and its performance will be 
regularly assessed. 
- 
Kobe III-1: 
Management 
Strategy 
Evaluation (MSE) 
Contribute to a Joint 
Technical WG on MSE to 
facilitate the implementation 
the PA (Kobe III p.4 and 
Annex 3 § 1.3) 
PR-2014-19: The CCSBT should continue to 
contribute to tuna RFMOs effort to develop MSE 
capacity and implementation. As the Joint WG 
now exists, more specific recommendations might 
be more useful in the future. 
ESC 
SAWG-2010 
- Regular large scale tagging 
programs (including archival 
tagging) to estimate natural 
mortality growth and 
movement patterns as well 
as tuna behavior and 
vulnerability. 
PR-2014-20: Large scale tagging programmes do 
not seem to be undertaken anymore which means 
that the recommendation above is not fulfilled. It 
should be maintained or formally rejected by the 
ESC with an explicit rationale. 
ESC 
SAWG-2010 
- The study of spatial aspects 
of stock assessment to 
substantiate spatial 
management measures. 
PR-2014-21: Efforts to gain information on the 
spatial structure and movements of the SBT stock 
and the fleets exploiting it should be continued as 
they are of paramount importance for 
management and conservation. 
PR-2014-22: A spatial, ecosystem-based 
framework could be developed as a strategic layer 
of assessment, added to the presently more 
tactical framework (imposed by the knowledge 
available as well as the need to deliver an 
undifferentiated TAC estimate), to be used every 
5-10 years, perhaps in connection (not in 
synchrony) with the MP 6-yearly performance 
assessment, for obtaining a more realistic 
foresight. 
ESC 
 
 
 
ESC 
SAWG-2010 
- The use of high-resolution 
spatial ecosystem models to 
better integrate biological 
features of tuna stocks and 
their environment.  
- Agree on a list of minimum 
standards for stock 
assessment 
PR-2014-23: The recommendation is apparently 
being implemented across various activities. It 
should probably be maintained until a formal 
document is agreed and published on minimal 
stock assessment standards. 
ESC 
SAWG-2010 
- Develop research capacity 
in developing Members’ 
countries 
PR-2014-24: This subject is important for the 
future of the CCSBT decision making progress 
and legitimacy and should be elevated to a 
continuing recommendation. The direct role of 
CCSBT might be limited (by its funding and own 
capacity to train) but it could help identify needs, 
promote assistance and monitor capacity-building 
activities directly related to the fulfilment of its 
mandate. 
ESC 
ERS 
Bycatch policy 
and management 
strategy 
No specific 
recommendations  
PR-2014-25: It is recommended to bring together 
all the elements presently related to ERS to 
elaborate a proper policy and management 
strategy for ERS, adopting clear objectives as 
well as reference values or trends, limits and 
targets, against which performance could be 
assessed. Better use of observers would improve 
the efficiency of the policy. 
ERS 
Adoption of conservation and management measures 
 
SA-2008-13 
The CCSBT should continue 
to make conservation and 
management measures 
which are consistent with 
scientific advice from the 
Extended Scientific 
Committee. 
PR-2014-26: As a consequence, the 
recommendation above, in its present form, could 
be considered as being implemented correctly. As 
it seems to have been incorporated in the ordinary 
practice of the EC, it might be eliminated from 
the list and replaced, as appropriate with more 
specific ones in the future. 
- 
SA-2008-14 
The CCSBT should satisfy 
the UNFSA standards. 
PR-2014-27: This recommendation refers to an 
international legal obligation. It could be 
maintained but cannot be usefully assessed unless 
it is made more specific (see next 
recommendation). New recommendations could, 
for example, call for explicit implementation of 
instruments that further the implementation of 
UNCLOS and UNFSA such as International 
Guidelines and Action Plans for management of 
fishing capacity, control of IUU, management of 
sharks, etc… or the CBD and WSSD 
requirements for Marine Protected Areas (e.g. to 
protect SBT spawners and juveniles or ERS) and 
other international agreements. It could also call 
for binding measures for CCSBT ERS 
conservation and management. 
 
SA-2008-15 
The parties to the 
Convention could review the 
Convention and modernise it 
to UNFSA standards. 
PR-2014-28: The CCSBT should formally 
consider the need to align its Convention to the 
UNFSA principles and standards. A gap analysis 
could be an easy first step based on which a 
decision to proceed with a formal revision or 
through Strategic and management planning 
could be explicitly made. 
 
SA-2008-16 
The CCSBT should develop 
a Strategic Plan plus a 
Management Plan to 
implement minimum 
standards for the fishery 
(SA-2008). 
PR-2014-29: The CCSBT should pursue the 
effort of coherent planning. As conservation and 
management are the core of the CCSBT mandate 
and the Strategic Plan provides a comprehensive 
framework for fulfilling that mandate, it could be 
suggested to attach to the recently adopted 
Strategic Plan (as an annex) a management Plan, 
going into more implementation details. This 
could help avoid duplication and integrate better 
the policy, the strategy and the management plan. 
The management procedure and metarule 
processes are part of the Management Plan. 
 
SA-2008-17 
Consider moving to 
alternative allocation 
principles of the TAC rather 
than set tonnages. 
PR-2014-30: The present practice fulfils the 
recommendation. As long as members and 
candidate members find the present approach 
convenient, there is no reason to change it. 
 
Kobe-1: 
Ecologically 
related species 
Strengthen conservation and 
management measures to 
minimize harmful impacts of 
SBT fisheries on non-target 
populations and their 
ecosystems and ensure long-
term sustainability, using the 
best scientific evidence 
available. In particular: 
Increase attention on sharks, 
seabirds, turtles and 
mammals (KIII.5.b.f), 
minimizing the impact of 
fishing (KI.I.10; KI.I.11). 
Assess and manage sharks 
(KI.I.11; KII.1f; KIII.5.b.d). 
Require the use of on-board 
observers to collect discards 
data (KIII.5.b.a); 
PR-2014-31: There is obviously a trade-off in the 
use of the observers’ time which affects the 
precision of the data (and ensuing assessments) of 
SBT and ERS respectively. Although the detailed 
data collected eventually by observers is not 
known, a minimal assessment of the state of the 
ERS (or contribution to such assessment in a 
collaborative framework) will probably require 
more ERS data to be collected. The use of video 
cameras might be a useful assistance to the 
observer.

Ensure that [management] 
measures reflect 
international agreements, 
tools and guidelines to 
reduce bycatch, including 
the relevant provisions of the 
FAO Code of Conduct, the 
IPOAs for Seabirds and 
Sharks and the FAO 
guidelines on sea turtles. 
(BCWG 2010). 
PR-2014-32: The CCSBT relies on its members 
to comply with non-CCSBT institutions 
requirements and the degree of control or 
verification by CCSBT of the effectiveness is not 
clear and possibly insufficient. Formally adopting 
the relevant FAO IPOAs, adapting them to 
regional plans of Action (RPOAs), and instituting 
an implementation framework would be an 
efficient way to align CCSBT management 
practices with the international standards while 
strengthening the purely voluntary FAO 
instruments. 
ERS 
Kobe-1: 
Ecologically 
related species 
Adopt the following 
principles reflecting best 
practice: bycatch avoidance 
and mitigation measures 
should be: (1) binding, (2) 
clear and direct, (3) 
measureable, (4) science-
based, (5) ecosystem-based, 
(6) ecologically efficient 
(reduces the mortality of 
bycatch), (7) practical and 
safe, (8) economically 
efficient, (9) holistic, (10) 
collaboratively developed 
with industry and 
stakeholders, and (11) fully 
implemented. 
PR-2014-33: The real extent of the problem (if 
any) in relation of turtles and mammals should be 
transparently assessed by the ERSWG. The 
overall policy in relation to ERS, summarized in 
the Strategic Plan, provides the higher level frame 
for the ERS part of a future management plan. 
PR-2014-34: As mentioned in the PR-2008, the 
most effective way to reduce collateral impacts on 
ERS is through binding measures implemented by 
members and cooperating non-members and the 
duty to do so is established through the 
commitments made by governments in other fora 
to use the CCSBT and other RFMOs for just such 
purposes. The commitments are referred to also in 
the Kobe criteria a, h, and i. 
ERS 
PR-2008-4 
Apply the precautionary 
approach as set forth in 
UNFSA Article 6 and the 
Code of Conduct for 
Responsible Fisheries 
Article 7.5, including the 
application of precautionary 
reference points (PR-2008; 
Kobe I, § I.I.4 and 1.10). 
PR-2014-35: This generic recommendation has 
very long-term implementation implications and 
could be considered as being implemented 
continuously as long as a precautionary MP is 
used together with the metarule. If formally 
adopted as a Principle (possibly inserted in a 
revised Convention), it would not need to be 
carried forward as a recommendation. 
 
Kobe-2: the 
ecosystem 
approach 
Apply the Ecosystem 
Approach to Fisheries (EAF) 
to manage bycatch of target 
and non-target species 
(Kobe I, §I.4, §.I.10); 
PR-2014-36: Consider the present elements of the 
CCSBT fishery policy and management 
framework which belong to an EAF. Identify 
possible gaps, discuss them, and move to fill 
them. Assess explicitly the compliance with the 
agreed EAF framework. 
 
Kobe-3: 
rebuilding plans 
Adopt and implement 
effective rebuilding plans for 
depleted or overfished 
stocks (Kobe I § 1.4); 
PR.2014-35: As it stands the original 
recommendation is largely completed with the 
adoption of a Management procedure and a 
Strategic Plan. However, the effectiveness of the 
rebuilding strategy and plans needs to be 
regularly checked for performance. 
 
Capacity management 
 
PR-2008-5 
The CCSBT should at very 
least implement the 
recommendations set forth 
in the FAO International 
Plan of Action on the 
management of fishing 
capacity. 
PR-2014-37: As a minimum, the CCSBT should 
continue to monitor the list of vessels (authorized 
and IUU) and develop indices of capacity (e.g. 
number of vessels as corrected by size, tonnage 
and technology) to ascertain that capacity is 
adjusted to the stock’s biological productivity 
(and hence to the TAC). 
PR-2014-38: If the stock builds up, the TAC will 
increase and higher capacity will be needed to 
take it. As CCSBT plans to assess the MSY (or 
MEY) replacement yield, it should 
simultaneously project the capacity it will need, 
compare it to the present one and act accordingly. 
PR-2014-39: A longer-term proposition might be 
to seek agreement of other tuna RFMOs for a 
coordinated regional management of tuna fleets 
capacity to connect to the Global Register of 
ATVs. 
CC 
Compatibility of management measures 
 
SA-2008-18 
The CCSBT’s arrangements 
in relation to catch limits 
and national allocations are 
compatible between high 
seas and in areas under 
national jurisdiction. The 
CCSBT should continue to 
ensure that measures are 
compatible. 
PR-2014-40. Because of the central importance 
of spawning and recruitment for stock rebuilding, 
additional efforts should be made to develop, in 
Indonesian waters, spatio-temporal restrictions, 
equitable and compatible with the rest of the 
management strategy. 
ESC 
Fishing allocations and opportunities 
 
SA-2008-19 
The CCSBT should improve 
its accountability for 
decision making and move 
towards separating the TAC 
decision from allocation 
decisions… the CCSBT 
should consider moving to 
national allocations based on 
alternative principles, rather 
than set tonnages. 
PR-2014-41: This recommendation has been 
completed and the required separation between 
the TAC determination and the national 
allocations is now institutionalized and part of the 
normal practice of the CCSBT.

2. Compliance and enforcement 
 
Flag State duties 
 
SA-2008-20 
All members and 
cooperating non-members 
should continue to take all 
necessary actions to ensure 
compliance with 
conservation and 
management measures 
adopted by the CCSBT. 
There is now an urgent need 
for CCSBT to finalise longer 
term MCS arrangements 
centred on harmonised 
arrangements under a CDS. 
PR-2014-42: The CCSBT should continue to 
ensure compliance by all possible means, 
including through continued, and full 
implementation of the enhanced 
Compliance Committee process, QAR program 
and compliance action plans and policies. Any 
additional recommendations on compliance that 
stem from these new processes should be specific 
and lead to action by the CCSBT in accordance 
with the rules and procedures of the Compliance 
Committee and related Compliance Action Plan 
and tools. No additional recommendations are 
necessary. 
CC 
Port State measures 
 
SA-2008-21 
Bearing in mind the need to 
avoid duplication of effort, 
the [outcome of the] FAO 
Technical Consultation on 
Port State Measures that was 
held in Rome on 23-27 June 
2008, provides the 
Commission with some 
guidance on a preferred 
model when considering 
implementation of any 
CCSBT Port State measure. 
That new agreement may not 
enter into force for several 
years. In the meantime, the 
CCSBT should move to 
adopt a broader set of Port 
State Measures designed to 
prevent the landing and 
transshipment of illegal, 
unreported and unregulated 
SBT catches – including by 
vessels on the CCSBT 
authorized vessel list. 
PR-20014-41: The CCSBT should accelerate its 
progress in developing a Resolution on Port State 
Measures consistent with the 2009 FAO Port 
States Agreement. 
CC 
Monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) 
 
SA-2008-22 
As the CCSBT does not 
have its Convention area and 
SBT migrates into the other 
tuna RFMOs’ areas of 
jurisdiction, the CCSBT 
should cooperate with the 
other tuna RFMOs to 
optimise harmonisation; 
improve global 
effectiveness; and avoid 
duplication of work. The 
CCSBT should prioritise the 
development of MCS in the 
context of a compliance 
plan. 
PR-2014-43: Considering that both technology 
and sister RFMOs programmes keep evolving, the 
CCSBT should continue to improve its MCS 
measures and scheme, and take additional steps to 
harmonize its MCS measures with other RFMOs. 
Details on areas to harmonize further are 
examined below. 
CC 
SA-2008-23 
Acknowledging the 2007 
Kobe commitment to 
consistent ROP standards, 
the CCSBT should align its 
observer program with those 
of other RFMOs which also 
have an observer program 
such as CCAMLR and the 
IOTC. 
PR-2014-44: The CCSBT should accelerate its 
efforts to strengthen its Scientific Observer 
Standards and ensure they are harmonized with 
those of neighbouring RFMOs with respect to 
ERS observer data. The CCSBT should also give 
serious consideration to the development of a 
ROP, perhaps through forging a relationship with 
the WCPFC to allow for mutual recognition or 
cross endorsement of observers, as the WCPFC 
and IATTC have done. 
ESC 
ERS 
CC 
PR-2008-6 
A VMS that is not 
centralised has limited 
effectiveness and CCAMLR 
has adopted a centralised 
VMS (SA-2008). Although 
most CCSBT members 
require their vessels to use  
satellite-based vessel 
monitoring systems (VMS) 
and despite the adoption in 
2006 of a CCSBT resolution 
committing members and 
cooperating non-members to 
adopt an integrated VMS 
system, the CCSBT still 
does not have such a system 
in place. The Commission 
should institute one 
promptly. 
PR-2014-45: The CCSBT should trigger 
paragraph 5 of its 2008 CCSBT Resolution and 
goal 8.3 of its Compliance Action Plan, and 
review and revise the Resolution to include 
specific baseline operational VMS standards for 
SBT vessels regardless of their area of operation, 
such as reporting frequencies, recipients and use 
of VMS data (such as by the CCSBT Secretariat, 
SC/ESC, and ERSWG and Compliance 
Committees (other than summary reports 
currently required under the 2008 Resolution). 
For instance, CCSBT members and CNMs could 
agree that their SBT vessels operating in other 
RFMO Convention Areas would transmit the 
VMS reports sent under those VMS programs to 
the CCSBT Secretariat. 
CC 
Transhipment at 
sea 
No specific 
recommendations 
PR-2014-46: The CCSBT should accelerate its 
progress in reviewing its Transshipment Program 
for tuna longline vessels in conjunction with the 
development of a Port State measures resolution 
that is consistent with the 2009 FAO Port States 
Agreement. The CCSBT should also be prepared 
to develop rules to govern at sea transshipment 
involving purse seine vessels that are consistent 
with those adopted by the WCPFC, if at-sea 
transhipment activities involving such vessels 
begin to be utilized in the future. 
CC 
High seas 
boarding and 
inspection 
No specific 
recommendations 
PR-2014-47: CCSBT should therefore develop as 
a matter of priority procedures for high seas 
boarding and inspection of SBT vessels. 
CC 
Follow-up on infringements 
 
SA-2008-24 
The CCSBT should, as a 
minimum, establish agreed 
rules on the treatment of 
overcatch (requirement of 
payback). Ideally, the 
CCSBT should establish a 
range of penalties in relation 
to all conservation measures. 
PR-2014-48: The CCSBT has taken steps since 
2008 to considerably strengthen its compliance 
assessment processes and tools, including a 
framework for applying a range of penalties for 
instances of Member and CNM non-compliance 
with CCSBT measures. CCSBT should continue 
to refine these tools and ensue they are 
transparently and fairly implemented when 
necessary to ensure legitimacy and integrity in its 
system, thereby creating an incentive for 
compliance among members and CNMs. 
CC 
Cooperative mechanisms to detect and deter non-compliance 
 
SA-2008-25 
- All Members and 
Cooperating Non-Members 
should submit their national 
reports to the CCSBT. 
- The CCSBT allocate 
sufficient time to the CC and 
the Extended Commission to 
allow them to complete both 
routine and development 
work each year. 
PR-2014-49: The CCSBT has taken steps since 
2008 to considerably strengthen its compliance 
assessment processes and tools, including 
reworking its Compliance Committee terms of 
reference, giving the Committee adequate time to 
meet, and adopting an IUU Vessel List measure. 
Members and CNMs are cooperating with the 
process, providing their national reports on time 
and submitting themselves to a multilateral 
review of their compliance in the Compliance 
Committee. The CCSBT should continue 
implement these tools fully and ensure non-
compliance is transparently and fairly assessed, 
thereby creating an incentive for compliance 
among members and CNMs. The CCSBT should 
also consider mandating that a member who is 
being considered for a sanction under its policies 
may not participate in the decision-making on that 
issue. 
CC 
Market-related measures 
 
SA-2008-26 
- The CCSBT should thus 
continue to move forward 
smartly toward the adoption 
and implementation of a full 
Catch documentation system 
(CDS). 
- The CCSBT should 
implement a CDS as matter 
of urgency.  
- Pending implementation of 
a CDS, all members and 
cooperating non-members 
should be required to 
implement the TIS. 
- The CCSBT should 
monitor all market and port 
states and encourage 
compliance with CCSBT 
monitoring and trade 
measures. 
PR-2014-50: The initial recommendations are 
already fairly well implemented. CCSBT should 
explore all available options for tracking the trade 
of SBT between those States that are not members 
or CNMs, and continue to engage in outreach 
(both from the Secretariat and individually as 
CCSBT members or CNMs, such as through 
diplomatic channels and in bilateral contacts) to 
those non-member nations to encourage their 
participation in and implementation of the 
CCSBT CDS. 
CC 
3. Decision-making, transparency and dispute settlement 
 
Decision-making and transparency 
 
SA-2008-27 
Consensus decision making 
does mean that some 
decision making is delayed 
but the Commission could 
also consider that some day 
to day operational decision 
making could be devolved to 
the Chair or the Executive 
Secretary (by unanimous 
decision of the 
Commission). 
PR-2014-51: As changing the CCSBT decision-
making model (from unanimous to majority 
decision-making) would require amending the 
Convention, no specific recommendations are 
offered. However, should the CCSBT decide to 
embark on a process to evaluate and modify its 
Convention provisions – as several other RFMOs 
have done in the last decade (e.g., see NAFO, 
NEAFC, ICCAT and IATTC) and which is noted 
in the CCSBT Strategic Plan- there are a number 
of alternative models for decision-making 
(currently employed by other RFMOs) from 
which it could choose. 
 
SA-2008-28 
- As [the rules and 
procedures on observers] are 
not in keeping with the spirit 
of current international 
fisheries governance 
frameworks, the CCSBT 
should consider modernizing 
Rule 3 of its rules of 
procedure. 
- The CCSBT and its 
members should improve 
openness by better 
publication of the rules for 
observers. One possible 
option would be to put the 
information about the 
current arrangements to 
accept observers on the 
CCSBT website. 
PR-2014-52: The present policy and regulations 
of CCSBT regarding observers are now in line 
with international standards and the initial 
recommendations can be considered as fulfilled 
and dropped. 
- 
Decision-making and dispute settlement 
 
Kobe-4: dispute 
settlement 
Establish adequate 
mechanisms for dispute 
settlement. 
PR-2014-53: It is recommended that the CCSBT 
seriously consider developing an alternative 
approach to dispute settlement/conflict resolution 
to avoid the potential for future stalemates that 
could significantly compromise the conservation 
and management of the SBT resource. As noted 
by the PR-2008, the additional dispute settlement 
rules provided by the UNFSA could usefully be 
used as now all CNMs and members of the 
Extended Commission, except Taiwan, are party 
to the UNFSA. 
 
4. International cooperation 
 
Relationship to cooperating non-members (CNMs) 
 
Kobe-5: 
Cooperating non-
members 
Extent to which the RFMO 
facilitates cooperation 
between members and non-
members, including through 
the adoption and 
implementation of 
procedures for granting 
cooperating status. 
PR-2014-54: CCSBT has given particular 
attention to the subject of non-members with a 
view to facilitate their participation in the 
governance process. No particular 
recommendation is therefore needed except to 
continue paying attention to the issue and pursue 
its efforts towards the remaining non-members 
and potential newcomers in the fishery. 
 
Relationship to non-cooperating non-members  
 
Kobe-6: Non-
cooperating non-
members 
Members and cooperating 
non-members of CCSBT 
should share information 
about non-cooperating non-
members’ vessels fishing on 
SBT and take appropriate 
measures to deter the 
activities of such vessels. 
PR-2014-55. CCSBT has given particular 
attention also to the subject of non-cooperating 
non-members with a view to deter the activities of 
their vessels. CCSBT should continue its efforts 
to improve collaboration with all the actors in the 
fishery to continue to strengthen its efforts in 
combating IUU fishing activities and ensure the 
effective implementation of its measures and 
programs. In addition, the development of port 
State measures in line with the FAO Port States 
Agreement (as is discussed in section 4.2.2) could 
greatly assist in this area. 
CC 
Cooperation with other RFMOs 
 
SA-2008-29 
PR-2008 
- There are significant 
opportunities for the CCSBT 
to work more closely with 
and to harmonise measures 
with other RFMOs, 
especially with the other 
tuna- RFMOs, and this 
should be a priority area for 
the CCSBT. 
- The CCSBT should add 
combating IUU fishing 
activities to the list of 
crosscutting issues affecting 
all tuna RFMOs, as well as 
monitoring and regulating 
transshipment, particularly 
given CCSBT’s 
geographical overlap with 
the Indian Ocean Tuna 
Commission and the 
Western and Central Pacific 
Fisheries Commission.  
PR-2014-56: Given the reliance of the CCSBT, in 
many ways, on cooperative relationships with 
other RFMOs for “harmonizing” with (and using 
directly) a number of those neighbouring 
RFMOs’ measures, the work called for by the 
Kobe process and its 2010 workshops is 
particularly relevant. The CCSBT should look 
seriously for opportunities to re-invigorate 
discussions among its neighbouring RFMOs to 
work more closely to implement the Kobe 
recommendations. Key areas of collaboration 
include: more systematic exchange of data and 
information (interoperable databases); additional 
harmonization of measures; conducting more 
joint scientific workshops; increasing 
coordination of compliance work, particularly to 
combat IUU fishing and conserve and manage 
ERS; large-scale  tagging programmes; ecosystem 
approach implementation; large scale ecosystem-
based modelling; Management Strategy 
Evaluation; harmonisation of MCS systems; 
common formats for assessing compliance (with 
data reporting; infringements, etc.); capacity-
building (e.g. training courses); and development 
of common positions at IUCN, CITES, CBD, and 
the UNGA.

Special requirements of developing States 
 
SA-2008-30 
No change [in the CCSBT 
policy regarding developing 
Members and CNMs] is 
necessary. 
PR-2014-57: As is noted it is Strategic Plan, the 
CCSBT should develop a more comprehensive 
strategy for addressing the capacity building 
needs, particularly with regard to compliance with 
CCSBT obligations, programs, and implementing 
the CDS, of developing State members/CNMs. 
One model to consider is that of the IOTC, which 
conducts compliance “missions” in country to 
assist developing State members in identifying 
areas of deficiency and in developing an action 
plan to improve. 
CC 
5. Financial and administrative issues 
 
Availability of resources for RFMO activities 
 
SA-2008-31 
The CCSBT should consider 
establishing a position at the 
Secretariat to: (i) provide 
policy and management 
advice; (ii) take a more 
proactive role in seeking 
advice/positions of 
members; and (iii) enhance 
implementation of the 
Strategic Plan. 
PR-2014-58: This recommendation has been 
fully implemented. 
- 
Financial 
resources 
No specific 
recommendations 
PR-2014-59: This, together with the fact that 
there do not seem to be any indication of under-
delivery, would indicate that resources allocated 
by Members to the Commission are more than 
sufficient to cover planned activities. The 
resulting systematic carry-over is probably an 
illustration of the Secretariat’s concern with 
financial efficiency. However,  systematic carry-
over is usually not considered good budgetary 
practice as, in principle, unless all funding 
requests were accepted during the budgeting 
process, the savings indicate that activities that 
were not funded for lack of funds  could have 
been undertaken and suffered  unnecessarily from 
the decision. Uncertainties are always an issue but 
if they always result in carry-over they may 
indicate there may be room for improved 
planning (with better risk assessment). A more 
professional advice should be given by the 
Auditor. 
 
Funding of the 
aerial survey 
No specific 
recommendations 
The PR-2014 does not have the elements needed 
to propose any recommendation on this subject. 
- 
Efficiency and cost-effectiveness 
 
SA-2008-32 
The Secretariat should 
continue to run the CCSBT 
efficiently and effectively. 
PR-2014-60: Considering the values generated 
and the costs supported one might suspect that 
real “efficiency” might be made more by 
accelerating stock rebuilding than reducing 
administrative and research costs. As a 
consequence, considering that the CCSBT deals 
with one single species and few markets. It might 
be in a better position than other tuna RFMOs to 
consider undertaking at least a preliminary 
economic analysis of implications of its 
rebuilding strategy (taking into account, first, only 
market values) in order to shed some light on the 
economic implications of the parameters 
presently used for the Management Procedure and 
the planned rebuilding trajectory (still undefined). 
 
Overall CCSBT performance review process 
 
FAO review of 
performance 
reviews in 
RFMOs 
1. Performance Review 
Panels: Use a common 
approach and criteria but 
maintain flexibility.  
2. Budget: Provide a 
reasonable and appropriate 
budget for the PR.  
3. Cooperation: If needed 
call for cooperation with 
other RFMOs to enhance the 
PR. 
4. Role of the Secretariat: 
Play a proactive role, as a 
resource and a participant in 
the PR.  
5. Role of Members: Should 
be encouraged to provide 
views/ comments on the PR. 
6. Role of other 
stakeholders: Should be 
encouraged to provide 
views/comments on the PR.  
7. Methodology: Provide 
maximum opportunity for 
communication among the 
panel members, by one or 
more meetings and or 
through other means.  
 
PR-2014-61: Based on the above elements of 
evidence, it appears that the CCSBT has 
satisfactorily fulfilled the criteria established for 
the RFMOs Performance Review process.  
PR-2014-62: If not available yet, It would be 
useful and in line with best administration 
practices, to keep a formal record of all 
recommendations with related metadata (date, 
subject, achievements, current status, etc.). It is 
therefore recommended to keep such a formal 
central repository of the recommendations 
emanating from the EC and ESC, and also from 
working groups or other processes.  
PR-2014-63: The fact that the Strategic Plan is 
structured along the main Kobe Criteria mean that 
sooner rather than later, the Performance Review 
could become an integral part of the Strategic 
Plan implementation and the Recommendation 
Repository an important part of the 
implementation dashboard.
