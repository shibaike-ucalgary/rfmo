Report of the Extended Commission of the 
Nineteenth Annual Meeting of the Commission 
1-4 October 2012 
Takamatsu City, Japan 
 
Agenda Item 1. 
Opening of meeting 
1.1. 
 Confirmation of Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended Commission 
of the Nineteenth Meeting of the Commission 
1. 
After the Opening Ceremony in which participants were greeted by officials from 
the Japanese government (Fisheries Agency of Japan) and the Kagawa Prefecture, 
the Chair welcomed participants and opened the meeting. 
2. 
Dr. Akima Umezawa (Japan) was confirmed as the Chair of the Extended 
Commission of CCSBT19, and Mr. Phillip Glyde (Australia) was confirmed as 
the Vice Chair. 
3. 
The Chair noted that the Commission can now move on to a new phase, 
especially for strengthening compliance, given the important decisions made in 
the previous year. 
 
1.2.  
Adoption of agenda 
4. 
The agenda was adopted, and is included at Attachment 1.  No items of general 
business were raised at this time.  
5. 
The list of documents submitted to the meeting is at Attachment 2. 
6. 
The Chair summarised arrangements for the timing of the meeting and for the 
Finance and Administration Committee. 
 
1.3.  
Opening statements 
7. 
The Executive Secretary conveyed the regrets of the Philippines for its absence 
from the Extended Commission meeting due to a conflict with the concurrent 
WCPFC Technical and Compliance Committee meeting. 
 
1.3.1 Members 
8. 
Members made their opening statements and introduced their delegations. The 
list of participants is included at Attachment 3. 
9. 
Opening statements by Members of the Extended Commission are at 
Attachment 4.  
 
1.3.2 Cooperating Non-Members 
10. Opening statements by Cooperating Non-Members (CNMs) are at Attachment 5. 
 
 
1.3.3 Observers 
11. Opening Statements by Observers are at Attachment 6. 
 
Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
12. Members noted the report from the Secretariat (CCSBT-EC/1210/04) and agreed 
to the following recommendations: 
• The term of the current Chair of the ERSWG be extended for two additional 
ERSWG meetings after the next meeting; 
• The Secretariat should be tasked with developing an authoritative 
Compendium of CCSBT Conservation and Management Resolutions, 
Decisions and Recommendations together with a numbering scheme to allow 
easy reference to each of these items.  In addition, as part of this process, the 
Secretariat should identify any redundant Resolutions as well as any 
Resolutions that might need to be modified.  It was requested that, if possible, 
the Secretariat should present the proposed Compendium for consideration at 
the next meeting of the Extended Commission.  
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
13. The Executive Secretary provided an outline of financial matters  the Extended 
Commission meeting would need to consider, including the revised budget for 
2012 (CCSBT-EC/1210/05), and the proposed budget for 2013 (CCSBT-
EC/1210/06).   
14. It was noted that substantive savings had been made in respect of the approved 
2012 budget. This was due to an unusual set of circumstances where large 
savings had been made in two main areas – the recruitment of the Compliance 
Manager and the success in obtaining a venue for CCSBT 19 in Takamatsu City 
rather than in Tokyo. It was further noted that this level of savings was unlikely 
to re-occur in future years. 
15. Detailed consideration of the two budget papers was referred to the Finance and 
Administration Committee (FAC). 
16. The FAC was convened to consider: 
• The revised budget for 2012; 
• The proposed budget for 2013; and 
• Other finance and administration issues including the potential establishment 
of a “Contributions Stabilisation Fund” (CSF) proposed in CCSBT-
EC/1210/06, and a request by Australia that an estimate of expenditure for the 
scientific aerial survey of juvenile SBT be included in the proposed 2013 
budget and/or that the 2012 operating surplus be put towards funding scientific 
work, for example off-setting the cost to Members of funding the aerial survey 
through their regular contributions.  Other suggestions were that the 2012 
 
surplus be considered for funding alternative items such as MCS issues, or 
potentially returning any savings to the Members themselves. 
17. Mr. Paul Ross (Australia) was nominated as Chair of the FAC. 
 
3.1.  
Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
18. Mr. Paul Ross presented the report of the FAC, which is provided at Attachment 
7, and includes a revised budget for 2012 and a recommended budget for 2013. 
19. It was noted that the recommended budget for 2013 includes a $100,000 shared 
contribution towards the costs of the scientific aerial survey and a small 
assistance fund for developing country Members and CNMs.  The budget surplus 
from 2012 was be fully utilised in the recommended budget for 2013, and the 
FAC therefore recommended that the proposed establishment of a Contributions 
Stabilisation Fund (CSF) should not be considered at this time.  The 
recommended budget for 2013 will result in approximately a 5% increase to 
Members’ contributions.    
20. Australia thanked Members for their assistance in providing funding for the 2013 
scientific aerial survey and their recognition of the contribution the aerial survey 
makes to the Management Procedure. Australia undertook to provide Members 
with the data as these become available from the contractor. 
21. Japan noted its preference that the ERSWG Data Exchange specified for 2010 
and 2011 ERS data should revert to 31 July 2013 given that the ERSWG would 
not be convened until 28 August 2013.  However, Japan did not wish to block 
consensus, so the data provision dates were not altered.  Furthermore, the 
meeting agreed to amend the ERSWG Data Exchange to prevent confusion that 
might arise between dates in that agreement and the report of the FAC. 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries and ERS Interactions 
22. The Chair of the Compliance Committee introduced this item and invited South 
Africa to present its annual review of its SBT fishery and compliance action plan 
to the Extended Commission.   South Africa presented its reports summarising 
the profile of its fishery, associated management measures, and the overcatch 
recorded in both 2011 and 2012. South Africa noted that it does not consider the 
current 40t allocation to be sufficient to allow it to effectively and efficiently 
manage its longline fisheries within its allocated SBT quota. 
23. South Africa answered a variety of questions on these reports. The positive 
progress made by South Africa in addressing ERS issues was welcomed. The 
importance of South Africa submitting an annual report to the next ERSWG was 
highlighted.  South Africa also noted that it investigated the fraudulent forms 
identified by the Secretariat, and that it would report outcome of criminal and 
administrative procedures currently being instituted against the exporting 
company. 
24. New Zealand asked for clarification as to what steps if any South Africa 
undertook to project when the SBT allocation will be reached by its domestic 
fleet in order to close the fishery in a timely manner. South Africa replied that it 
 
attempts to project the catch of its domestic fleet but unfortunately those 
projections were inaccurate this year based on a number of environmental factors 
and unusual distribution of SBT. 
25. Finally, South Africa indicated that it did not intend to pay back its recent 
overcatch due to the impracticality of managing the fishery with such a low 
allocation, but would endeavour to manage its fisheries within its allocation 
under the CCSBT.  
 
4.1. 
 Reports on Members’ projects 
26. The Chair opened the floor for any special reports from Members to be presented, 
and/or additional questions on annual reports, noting that an extensive question 
and answer session had already been held during the Compliance Committee. 
South Africa was asked one additional question regarding its observer coverage 
and funding streams for both its domestic and foreign charter observer 
arrangements. 
4.1.1. Market Monitoring 
27. No items were raised under this agenda item. 
4.1.2 Australian SBT farming operations, including implementation of 
stereo video monitoring 
28. Japan requested Australia’s immediate implementation of stereo video 
monitoring from 1 December 2012, noting that Australia already had enough 
information from its commercial trial to partially implement stereo video 
monitoring. 
29. Australia responded that it was not possible to conduct a partial introduction of 
stereo video monitoring.  
30. Japan and Australia agreed that stereo video monitoring will provide more 
precise weight estimates than the existing fish sampling method. 
31. Japan expressed its grave concern, based on its scientific analysis of length data 
from Japanese importers for imports of farmed SBT that there is a large bias in 
the fish sampling for farmed fish, which affects the total estimated catch for 
farms. Japan pointed out that the bias might even undermine the credibility of 
MP and requested Australia to verify growth rate of farmed SBT and report the 
result at Extended Science Committee. 
32. Australia rejected Japan’s arguments, noting the bias in Japan’s market analysis 
and the lack of transparency regarding the data used in the analysis.  Australia 
reiterated its view that the 40-fish sample method provided a sound basis for the 
estimation of the catch of Australia’s farm sector.  
33. Japan and Australia agreed to discuss these items bilaterally.  
34. Japan presented the results of its bilateral discussion with Australia, noting that 
the key discussion points remained unchanged:  Japan requested that monitoring 
with stereo video should be commenced in 2012, and Australia responded that 
this was not possible due to budgetary restraints. 
 
35. Australia reconfirmed its commitment to full implementation of stereo video 
monitoring and reiterated its intention to implement the system by 1 December 
2013. 
36. Japan and Australia agreed to undertake further bilateral discussions on these 
matters intersessionally. 
 
4.1.3 Other 
37. There was a brief discussion where Japan commented that Australia’s estimated 
weight of SBT retained by recreational fisheries should be counted against 
allocations, and Australia noted that there were a range of sources of mortality 
that were not currently well estimated including survival rates of discards from 
longliners, artisanal catch, bycatch of SBT, and illegal fishing.  Australia 
suggested a collaborative approach to addressing these issues. 
38. Australia noted that it is working with its States to develop a national recreational 
survey in order to provide reliable estimates of its recreational catch. Australia 
committed to providing updates to future CCSBT meetings. 
39. Australia requested that consideration be given to their request that the current 
“Recommendation to mitigate the impact on ecologically related species of 
fishing for southern bluefin tuna” be adopted as a binding resolution.  Australia 
and New Zealand noted the ERSWG recommendation that implementation of 
more effective mitigation measures based on best practice is urgently required to 
address seabird bycatch.  Australia’s suggested amendment to the 
Recommendation is provided at Attachment 8.  
40. Japan pointed out legal problems of the proposed legally-binding resolution, 
especially paragraph 2 while expressing its continued support to the protection of 
ERS. Japan emphasised that CCSBT Members should consider an individual 
recommendation or measure and decide it as CCSBT’s own recommendation or 
measure.  Japan considered that it is not appropriate for the Commission to adopt 
a resolution or measure in which Members shall, in a legally-binding manner, 
comply with measures and recommendations of other RFMOs, namely IOTC, 
WCPFC and ICCAT, irrespective of whether the Member or Cooperating Non-
Member concerned is a member of the relevant Commission or otherwise 
cooperates with it. Japan also pointed out that the Conventions establishing those 
RFMOs have provisions to withdraw from them, and this resolution, if adopted 
as a legally-binding resolution, would be legally binding even after a member 
withdraw from those RFMOs. 
41. New Zealand noted its view that the concerns outlined by Japan were the reason 
a binding measure was required and agreed that these concerns indicated the need 
for CCSBT to consider its own binding measure in the future. 
42. Korea put a reservation on this issue and suggested that the issue be discussed 
intersessionally. Korea noted that it did not oppose any of the substance of the 
recommendation, but needed more time to discuss changing the legal status of the 
recommendation, given that the proposal had not been received well in advance 
of the meeting. 
43. The meeting agreed to consider Australia’s proposal intersessionally or otherwise 
discussed it at CCSBT 20. 
 
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
44. The Chair of the Compliance Committee presented the report of the Seventh 
Meeting of the Compliance Committee (CC7), noting that two Cooperating Non-
Members (CNMs) - the Philippines and South Africa - had been unable to attend.  
The Chair thanked the participants for a productive and cooperative meeting, 
outlined the proposed extensive 2013 workplan, and drew attention to CC7’s 
recommendations to the Extended Commission.  In addition, the Chair noted that 
the large volume of work proposed in the 2013 workplan was much greater than 
the Secretariat’s routine workload.  Therefore, the Secretariat would need to 
prioritise work items, with the possibility that some tasks may not be achievable 
prior to CC8.  New Zealand offered to assist by preparing a draft Port State 
Measure for the Secretariat’s consideration and suggested that other Members 
may support other items. 
45. Japan reiterated the importance of compliance in order to ensure the recovery of 
SBT and its intention to consider necessary actions to stop importing any SBT in 
contravention of CCSBT measures.  
46. Members agreed to collect the relevant trade data in order to submit the relevant 
information to the Secretariat .  
47. The report of the Seventh Compliance Committee meeting, including its workplan 
and recommendations, was adopted and is at Attachment 9.  
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
(ERSWG) 
48. The Executive Secretary presented the report of the Ninth meeting of the 
ERSWG, including a review of the ERSWG’s 2013 workplan, which is 
summarised in paper CCSBT-EC/1210/09. 
49. The Executive Secretary sought approval from the Extended Commission for one 
specific action item in the workplan: for the ERSWG to approach other RFMOs 
with its offer to lead global work on assessments of impacts of fishing for tunas 
on seabirds and porbeagle sharks.  This item of work was endorsed by the 
Extended Commission. 
50. The report of ERSWG meeting, including its workplan and recommendations, 
was adopted and is at Attachment 10.  
51. Australia and New Zealand noted the ERSWG recommendation that 
implementation of more effective mitigation measures based on best practice is 
urgently required to address seabird bycatch.   
52.  Discussion then moved to the ERSWG Data Exchange proposal which is 
detailed in paper CCSBT-EC/1210/21.  Some Members indicated that they would 
have preferred a greater degree of detail in the information to be exchanged, but 
that the proposal represented a positive step forwards and was therefore 
supported. The ERSWG data exchange proposal was adopted and is at 
Attachment 11. 
 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
53. The Chair of the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) presented the report of the 
ESC meeting which is summarised in paper CCSBT-EC/1210/20 and includes a 
review of the ESC’s 2013 workplan.  The ESC Chair thanked Member scientists 
for their hard work and contributions to the report. 
54. The report of the 2012 ESC meeting, including its workplan and recommendations, 
was adopted and is at Attachment 12.  
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
8.1. TAC determination 
55.  The Chair introduced this item noting that CCSBT18 agreed to a TAC for 2012 
and 2013, and a process for setting a TAC for 2014.  The meeting re-confirmed 
the TAC determination decision of CCSBT 18 (paragraphs 32 and 33 of the 
report of CCSBT 18). 
 
8.2. Research Mortality Allowance 
56. The meeting agreed to the research mortality allowance set out in the paper 
CCSBT-EC/1210/11, which were: 1t for a trolling survey by Japan in the 
2012/13 season, and 5t for continued deployment of electronic tags by Australia. 
 
8.3. Allocation of TAC 
57. Table 1 sets out options for TACs in 2013 depending on whether or not South 
Africa accedes to the Convention.  South Africa was not able to inform the 
meeting of the likelihood and/or timing of its possible accession, and suggested 
that the meeting should set a deadline for its response, as no deadline currently 
exists.     
58. Table 1: Impact of South Africa’s accession in 2013 on allocations

59. The meeting agreed the following: 
• Members’ and Cooperating Non-members’ allocations for 2013 will initially 
be those listed in column “a” of Table 1, with the exception of South Africa 
who will have 40t; 
• To obtain an increased allocation for 2013, South Africa must provide advice 
of its accession to the Convention by 31 May 2013; 
• If South Africa accedes to the Convention by 31 May 2013, its 2013 allocation 
will increase to 80t, and Member’s allocations for 2013 will be fixed to be 
those listed in column “a” of Table 1; and 
• If South Africa does not accede to the convention by 31 May 2013, its 
allocation will remain at 40t and Members’ allocations for 2013 will change to 
those listed in column “b” of Table 1. 
60. South Africa’s allocation for 2014 will be 150t, subject to the outcome of the 
2013 results from the MP in accordance with the Resolution on the Adoption of a 
Management Procedure, if South Africa accedes before CCSBT20, otherwise its 
allocation will be discussed at CCSBT20. 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Implementation of the CCSBT Strategic Plan 
61. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/1210/12 on the 
implementation of the CCSBT Strategic Plan. The paper presented action items 
from the Strategic Plan for 2012 and 2013 which have not already been 
considered at CCSBT meetings. 
62. The meeting made the following decisions on implementation issues for 2012:  
Quality and provision of scientific advice – reporting on all sources of SBT 
mortality 
• The meeting adopted a Resolution on Reporting all Sources of Mortality of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna provided at Attachment 13.  It was noted that the 
Resolution is consistent with the revised reporting template adopted by CC7.   
Operation of the Commission – Kobe process - identifying opportunities for 
services to be coordinated amongst RFMOs 
• The meeting noted the improved coordination amongst RFMOs and agreed 
with the recommendation made in the paper that the Secretariat, Members and 
subsidiary bodies of the Extended Commission should continue to be watchful 
for opportunities to coordinate with other RFMOs and provide 
recommendations to the Extended Commission as such opportunities arise. 
 
Supporting developing countries 
• The meeting provided general support to the concept of creating a small fund 
to assist developing states such as Indonesia to attend relevant working group 
meetings (not the Extended Commission and the Extended Scientific 
Committee) and for conducting training/educational workshops for developing 
countries. 
Participation in the CCSBT 
• Lengthy discussions were held on developing mechanisms for extending 
CCSBT membership to Regional Economic Integration Organisations (REIOs), 
including consideration of membership to the Extended Commission.  The EU, 
advised it would like to seek admission to the Extended Commission, followed 
by full membership to the CCSBT if the Convention can be amended to 
accommodate its request.   
• There was support for the necessary changes to be made to allow REIOs to 
become Members of either the Extended Commission or the 
Commission.  The merits of amending the resolution to establish the Extended 
Commission versus amending the Convention text were discussed. The 
Members agreed that it was currently easier to consider amendments to the 
Resolution rather than the Convention which would involve a lengthy 
administrative approval process. 
• Australia joined other Members and agreed to consider amending the 
Resolution, but believed the option to discuss amending the Convention 
accordingly must remain a topic for discussion in the future. 
• A small drafting group was convened to draft appropriate amendments to the 
“Resolution to Establish an Extended Commission and an Extended Scientific 
Committee”.  New Zealand led further work on this and a consolidated draft 
text is provided at Attachment 14 for Members to consider prior to CCSBT 
20.  
• The EU confirmed its general support for the modified Resolution and 
provided some comments for clarification at Attachment 15. 
• The Extended Commission asked the Secretariat to develop a paper for 
consideration at CCSBT 20 outlining options for REIOs to become a Member 
following consultation with all Members and Cooperating Non-Members. 
• Taiwan asked that if Members decide to amend the Convention to allow a 
REIO to become a Party to the Convention, Members could consider how to 
allow Taiwan or Fishing Entities to accede to the Convention as well. 
• Japan emphasised the importance of the record of compliance with the CCSBT 
measures in considering accepting any Members to the Extended Commission. 
63. The meeting made the following decisions on implementation issues for 2013: 
Flexible management arrangements (ensuring SBT fishing capacity is 
commensurate with fishing opportunities) 
• The meeting agreed that each Member/CNM should: 
o Conduct a self-assessment of its fishing capacity, including non-target fleets 
that may impact on SBT, with respect to its national allocation of the SBT 
TAC and that this assessment be reported to CCSBT 20 in the agreed 
annual reporting template; 
 
o Report to CCSBT 20 in the agreed annual reporting template on any action 
it has taken or plans to take with respect to its fishing capacity;  and 
o If possible/appropriate include in their reports a comment on potential 
threats to SBT from over-capacity in Non-Cooperating Non Member 
(NCNM) fleets. 
• The meeting also agreed that CCSBT Observers to other RFMOs should report 
back to the Extended Commission on any changes in other RFMOs that could 
potentially result in effort shifts towards SBT fisheries. 
Performance review of the Commission 
• It was agreed that: 
o The next performance review of the Commission should be conducted 
during 2014 due to the large number of work items already planned for 
2013; 
o The terms of reference for the review should be finalised during 2013; and 
o The review should produce a single report and be conducted by an 
independent panel of 2-3 experts. 
• The meeting also adopted the recommendations in paper CCSBT-EC/1210/12 
that the review should include: 
o The criteria for reviewing the performance of RFMOs that was used in 
CCSBT’s original performance review; 
o Consideration of the extent to which modern fisheries management 
standards have been incorporated into the CCSBT’s decisions; and 
o Evaluation of progress in implementing the recommendation of the first 
performance review. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Cooperating Non-Members 
64. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/1210/13 on Cooperating 
Non-Members (CNMs). 
65. There were no significant areas of concern with respect to compliance by the 
Philippines and therefore Members confirmed the Philippines’ CNM status.  
66. Compliance of both the EU and South Africa with CCSBT Measures was 
discussed at length.   
67. The meeting confirmed the European Union’s continuing CNM status, and noted 
that the EU had committed to comply with CCSBT MCS measures and their 
existing reporting obligations including those under the CDS Resolution.   
68. The meeting also confirmed South Africa’s continuing CNM status, but noted its 
serious concerns about South Africa’s overcatches which had occurred in both 
2011 and 2012.  Indonesia’s agreement to continuing South Africa’s CNM status 
was subject to South Africa improving its future compliance with CCSBT 
Measures.  Members encouraged South Africa to accede to the Convention as 
soon as possible. South Africa thanked the EC for renewing South Africa’s CNM 
status and reconfirmed its commitment to comply with its quota allocated by 
CCSBT. 
 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
69. The Executive Secretary presented CCSBT-EC/1210/14 on CCSBT’s 
relationship with Non-members. 
70. Japan reported its 2010 to 2012 (inclusive) weights of SBT re-exported to China, 
and offered to assist in finding out more information about Chinese import 
sources during its bilateral discussions with China.  
71. It was noted that the Extended Commission might need to take a more proactive 
approach with regard to Non-Cooperating Non-Members (NCNM) market states, 
and that Members should raise matters in bilateral negotiations. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Evaluation of Kobe Process  Recommendations 
72. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/1210/15, which 
summarised the brief Kobe Steering Committee meeting which was held in the 
margins of COFI in Rome during July 2012.  The Steering Committee will be re-
convened in approximately one year.  
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
13.1. 
Reports from meetings of interest 
73. CCSBT Members act as observers at other RFMO meetings of interest and 
provide report backs to CCSBT on matters of relevance in order to improve

74. The following reports were delivered by Members as part of their observer duties 
for the CCSBT, and are attached at Attachment 16. 
• New Zealand’s report on the 8th annual meeting of the Western and Central 
Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) held during March 2012; 
• Australia’s report on the 30th annual meeting of the Commission for the 
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in 2011.  It 
was noted that the proposed cooperative arrangement with CCSBT had been

in Hobart between 23 October  – 1 November 2012; 
•  Japan’s report on the 16th session of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission 
(IOTC) in April 2012, and the 22nd annual meeting of the International

that ICCAT were continuing to strengthen compliance measures, and had 
agreed to trial an electronic Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS); and 
• Taiwan’s report on the 83rd annual meeting of the Inter-American Tropical 
Tuna Commission (IATTC) held in La Jolla, USA in June 2012. 
75. It was agreed that the following Members would act as Observers to other 
RFMOs on behalf of CCSBT during 2012/13: 
• Korea to replace New Zealand as an Observer to WCPFC, 
• Australia to continue as an Observer to CCAMLR, 
 
• Indonesia to replace Japan as an Observer to IOTC,  
• Japan to continue as an Observer to ICCAT, and 
• Taiwan to continue as an Observer to IATTC. 
76. Finally, the EU presented paper CCSBT-EC/1210/18 on its conference, 
“RFMOs – Fit for the Future”, which took place in Brussels on 1 June 2012, 
hosted by the European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Maria 
Damanaki, and attended by fifteen RFMOs. 
 
13.2  
Relationship with CCAMLR 
77. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/1210/16, focusing on 
CCSBT’s relationship with CCAMLR and CCAMLR’s request to finalise a 
cooperative arrangement with CCSBT. 
78. Members thanked the Secretariat for their work in drafting this alternative 
version of the cooperative arrangement with CCAMLR. 
79. The meeting supported the alternative version of the cooperative arrangement 
with CCAMLR provided at Annex 3 of the paper, with only minor amendment. 
The agreed version of the arrangement is provided at Attachment 17.  The 
Executive Secretary will forward it to CCAMLR for consideration at 
CCAMLR’s upcoming annual meeting.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Ohayo gozai-mass. 
First let me thank our hosts, the Japanese Government for the very warm welcome to 
the beautiful city of Takamatsu and to Japan. Arigato gozai-mas. 
Can I also thank Japan for the superb meeting venue.  This meeting room provides the 
delegates with something that we do not experience very often, a room with an 
amazing view.  We would also like to acknowledge the Secretariat for the meeting 
papers and arrangements, which are of the usual high standard.  Most of our 
delegation took the opportunity yesterday to experience spectacular, heritage listed 
Ritsurin Garden followed by a lovely lunch.  It was indeed a very pleasant, while a 
damp day.   
This week’s meeting provides the Extended Commission with a real opportunity to 
focus on the wider management of the SBT fisheries, given the adoption of the 
Management Procedure last year.  In Australia’s view, success this week will see 
stronger management measures in place, continued co-operation by all Members 
(similar to that experienced last year), further progress in implementing the CCSBT 
Strategic Plan and see the Extended Commission confirm its confidence in the 2011 
decision to adopt a precautionary management procedure.  Nevertheless we must 
recognise that southern bluefin tuna spawning stock remains at critically low levels.  
At last week’s Compliance Committee meeting there was general consensus among 
Members and Co-operating Non-Members that there is a need to strengthen 
compliance by adopting binding measures. The referral of the Minimum Performance 
Requirements and a revised annual reporting template for consideration by the 
Extended Commission are evidence of this. 
The Compliance Committee has set the Secretariat an ambitious work plan for 2013 
which is focused on improving compliance. Australia believes this must be the focus 
for the Extended Commission in coming years. 
The Extended Commission has struggled, at times, to move past the annual focus of 
setting the total allowable catch and national allocations.  It is Australia’s expectation 
that, with last year’s Extended Commission adopting the management procedure and 
setting the total allowable catch for three years, this week’s meeting is time for the 
Extended Commission to turn its focus to address the impacts of fishing for southern 
bluefin tuna on ecologically-related species, such as sharks, seabirds and sea turtles. A 
key first step would be for the Extended Commission to adopt a binding resolution 
based on the 2011 updated Recommendation to Mitigate the Impact on Ecologically 
Related Species of Fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna. 
In closing, let me again thank our Japanese hosts and assure you all that Australia will 
continue to work constructively and cooperatively with all Members to ensure the 
Extended Commission achieves its objectives this week. 
Arigato gozai-mas.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen, Good 
morning. 
 
On behalf of my delegation, I would like to extend our appreciation to our host, the 
Government of Japan for the warm welcome, and arrangements for the wonderful 
excursion program yesterday. We all enjoyed the trip and the excellent lunch. My 
thanks also go to Mr. Kennedy and the staffs of the Secretariat for preparing meeting 
documents and making meeting arrangements. I would also like to welcome the 
representatives of South Africa and European Union as Cooperating Non-Member and 
observers from Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, Fisheries 
Development Council International (FDCI), Human Society International, TRAFFIC, 
U.S.-Japan Research Institute. 
 
Last year, we made a very important decision that a Management Procedure (MP) 
would be used to guide the setting of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) global total 
allowable catch (TAC) to ensure that the SBT spawning stock biomass achieves the 
interim rebuilding target. Consistent with the MP, the Extended Scientific Committee 
(ESC) held in Tokyo this August recommended, based on the review of indicators, the 
2011 stock assessment, and MP inputs, that there is no need to revise the Extended 
Commission’s 2011 TAC decision. In such circumstance, the TAC for this year 
should not require further consideration, so that we can spend more time to consider 
how to make sure to comply with the conservation and management measures 
adopted by CCSBT. 
 
Catch documentation scheme (CDS) is a crucial measure to monitor Members and 
co-operating non-members’ SBT catch, so that we should consider how to improve it 
and call for cooperation from non-member’s market states. Providing assistance to 
developing country to establish monitoring, control, and surveillance (MCS) measures 
so as to reduce risk is another issue that we are concerned. Besides, for scientific 
research, all sources of SBT mortality should be collected and reported to the 
Extended Commission is also a very important issue.  
In closing, I look forward to working with all members and co-operating 
non-members in the following days to achieve positive outcomes for the SBT fishery. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen. 
 
It is indeed my great pleasure to be here to meet all of you and to participate inThe 
19th Extended Commission meeting,and on behalf of Indonesia government, let me 
first extend my sincere appreciation and gratitude to the Government ofJapan for 
hosting the 19thExtended Commission meeting of the CCSBT in this beautiful city of 
Takamatsu and officers of the Secretariat who made enormous effort to hold this 
meeting as well as interpreters. 
 
You may have observed that in this current session, it is the fifth occasion for 
Indonesia to participate in the important meeting as a member of the Commission 
since 2008. As a member, Indonesia has been taking a lot of efforts to ensure the 
sustainability management of SBT through complying with CCSBT resolutions. Even 
though there are a lot of obstacles, among others due to capacity building and wide 
range of vessels size in the artisanal fisheries, but working hand by hand with private 
sectors represented by Associations of Tuna Fishing Companies, we have shown our 
great concern and active participation in the management conservation and utilization 
of SBT resources. 
 
In order to support the strengthening of SBT data collection, we have implemented 
fishing logbook basedon Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries Regulation No. 
PER.18/MEN/2010. We do believe, through this regulation and also by implementing 
the fishing logbook we do believe that Indonesia data collection will be greatly 
improved, and will be able to strengthen the implementation of CCSBT-CDS system. 
Further data collection for SBT also will be implemented through log book for 
artisanal fisheries.  
In 2012, as a part of our commitment to comply with the RFMOs measures and 
resolutions, Indonesia has superseded regulation on high seas Minister Regulation 
Number: PER 03/MEN/2009 with Minister Regulation Number: PER 12/MEN/2012 
concerning Capture Fisheries Bussiness in High Seas.  The purpose of this regulation 
is to maintain our sustainable Tuna resources through fisheries management 
improvement.   This new Minister Regulation   has also adopted mitigation measures 
for marine turtles, seabird and sharks. 
 
It has been clearly understand that fish vessels are compulsory to install and activate 
VMS on-board when they are sailing and/or fishing. As a follow up to this Indonesia 
has issued the Minister Regulation No. PER.05/MEN/2007 concerning VMS 
implementation.There are 3 (three) matter have been stipulated in the regulation such 
as (i) foreign fisheries vessels 100 GT above are compulsory to procure their own 
transmitter, (ii) fisheries vessel with 60 – 100 GT may borrow transmitter belongs to 
government (if any stock) and (iii) fisheries vessels below 60 GT will be provided by 
VMS off line procured by government.However, in line with the need to improve 
SBT management and other tuna and following our commitment to comply with the 
RFMOs measures and resolutions, Indonesiawill amend  this Minister regulation in 
the near future. 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers ladies and gentlemen, 
 
Finally, I would like to end this opening statement by wishing that we could join 
hands together to bring out fruitful and satisfaction for our future sustainable 
development of SBT, fisheries management and sustainable utilization in consistency 
with CCRF. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Japan 
 
 
Good Morning. 
 
On behalf of the Japanese delegation, I would like to say a few words. First of all, I 
extend a hearty welcome to all of you on your visit to Takamatsu City. Some of you 
might be still recovering from the field trip, which was held yesterday but I hope you 
enjoy the grandstand view of beautiful Seto Inland Sea from this room and feel 
relaxed. I would like to thank Kagawa Prefecture and Takamatsu City for providing 
the wonderful venue. Also, I appreciate very much the Secretariat for meeting 
documents and arrangements which are of high standard as ever. 
 
CCSBT has finally started on the long road in order to fulfill its obligations to ensure, 
through appropriate management, the conservation and optimum utilization of 
southern bluefin tuna by setting the management goal and adopting MP. We have 
made a significant progress. However, we are not at the stage for being satisfied and 
we need to carry out our obligations to ensure recovery of the southern Bluefin tuna 
stock. One of our obligations is to comply with the CCSBT conservation and 
management measures. Japan will not leave the situation where members or 
cooperating non-members have any problem on their compliance. Also, as a market 
country of SBT, we consider refusing imported products with such a problem. Japan 
has an intention to put our utmost efforts through monitoring of all SBT catch. I am 
hoping to have a proper discussion regarding this point. 
 
Lastly, I hope all the participants will fully enjoy staying in Kagawa Prefecture. 
 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Tena koutou, tënä koutou, tënä koutou katoa.  Nga mihi nui ki a koutou 
 
[Greetings, greetings, many greetings to you all]  
 
On behalf of the New Zealand delegation I would like to extend our greetings to the 
Chair, distinguished visitors, our colleagues from other delegations and to observers at 
this meeting. 
 
Firstly thank you for today’s welcome and our thanks also to our hosts the Japanese 
Government for the selection of the beautiful Takamatsu City as the venue for this 
meeting.  
 
I would also like to thank the Japanese Fisheries Agency and the local Government 
for the excursion yesterday.  Despite the wet weather it was very enjoyable to tour the 
beautiful gardens and the lunch was exceptional. The New Zealand delegation was 
also further delighted yesterday by the impressive win of our world famous rugby 
team in Argentina. It was a good day. 
 
Turning to the meeting before us, New Zealand looks forward to further constructive 
dialogue on the important business of this Commission.  The adoption of a 
management procedure last year was a major milestone for us all.  It was the product 
of considerable work by all involved and it was a vital step in ensuring that the 
southern bluefin stock is set on a path to recovery.  One consequence of the adoption 
of the management procedure is that this year my opening statement will be brief. 
 
Further, we now have time to focus on the other important work before us and there is 
clearly more work to be done.  During this meeting we will hear from the Compliance 
Committee on the program of work that members consider is required to strengthen 
the monitoring control and surveillance arrangements of the Commission.  We will 
also hear from the Science Committee on its proposals for a programme of work to 
improve our understanding of the status of the stock and what influences this. 
 
We believe that this Commission now has the time to make good progress on a range 
of  issues identified in its strategic plan.  Many of these issues are a product of the 
good work of Commission members during the performance review conducted some 
years ago.  
 
New Zealand considers that it is timely to consider how we will address the potential 
interests of new members and also to take a more active approach to identifying 
nations with either a current fishing interest in southern bluefin tuna or which impact 
upon the stock in the pursuit of other fisheries. 
 
New Zealand also has a particular interest in ensuring that we make progress in 
evaluating the impacts of fishing for southern bluefin tuna on ecologically related 
species.  We have been encouraged by the progress made at the recent meeting of the 
ecologically related species working group.  This is an important area of work and we 
should not let this progress be dissipated.  It will be important at this meeting to 
decide on data exchange rules and the adoption of a risk based approach to assessing 
our fishery impacts. 
 
Chair, in closing New Zealand has been encouraged by the progress of the 
Commission in recent years and we look forward to achieving further positive 
outcomes from this meeting    
 
Thank you

Opening Statement by Korea 
 
Mr. Chair, Dr. Kennedy, distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen,  
 
I would like to begin by thanking the Japanese government for hosting the 7th 
Compliance Committee meeting and the 19th annual meeting of the CCSBT. I also 
appreciate the Secretariat for putting the meetings together. It would be remiss of me 
if I don’t mention yesterday’s excursion which this delegation enjoyed very much. I 
thank the municipal government of Takamatsu for their warm hospitality.  
 
Last year the Extended Commission marked a significant moment in the conservation 
and management of Southern Bluefin tuna by adopting the Management Procedure, or 
MP. Thanks to the contribution, effort and compromise from all involved in the 
process, the CCSBT could proudly prove to the world that it is one of the most 
effective fisheries management organizations.  
 
The first three-year bloc is of particular importance as it will set the reference for our 
future management directions. This year is the first year of MP application and 
science still says that we cannot let our guard down just yet. However, I’m convinced 
that the CCSBT will eventually meet its objectives because we are on the right path 
that we charted together last year.  
 
Now that we have ticked one of the most important tasks on our to-do list, we are 
ready to focus on other important issues including the management of Ecosystem 
Related Species, reporting templates, compliance evaluation, the implementation of 
the CCSBT Strategic Plan and budgetary issues. With the same spirit of cooperation 
and coordination, I hope the members and cooperating non-members will actively 
share their views and ideas with one another and find the best ways to address the 
issues on the table.  
 
It is up to us to maintain the reputation as one of the most effective fisheries 
management organizations. The Extended Commission will need to make constant 
efforts to keep its best practices, identify room for improvement and make necessary 
changes. Korea, as a responsible member of the CCSBT, will do its best to play its 
part in this endeavor.  
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by European Union 
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
The European Union is very pleased to be present at the Annual Meeting of the 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, after regrettably not 
being able to attend in 2010 and 2011 for reasons outside our control. We would like 
to thank Japan for hosting this meeting.  
 
The EU is committed to contributing to sustainable oceans and fisheries management 
in the best possible way. The EU is therefore currently in the process of reforming its 
Common Fisheries Policy, which strongly aims at bringing fish stocks back to 
sustainable levels. This reform also entails an important external dimension as any 
conservation policy makes little sense in isolation.  
 
A priority in the EU's external fishery policy is to develop and support governance 
systems through international cooperation at multilateral levels, among other things 
by contributing to the process towards ensuring the best possible functioning of 
RFMOs that will allow them to deliver against their mandate. In this spirit the EU 
Commission convened the one-day conference on RFMOs ('Fit for the Future') in 
May 2012 to discuss with all interested parties how RFMOs can strengthen their 
performance, which I will be able to provide a brief report of later in this meeting.  
 
As an active member of 15 RFMOs, and as Cooperating Non-Member to the CCSBT, 
the EU continues to be committed to ensuring compliance with conservation and 
management measures, including catch reporting and documentation obligations. The 
EU is also striving for ensuring the best data from fishing activities, as data provides 
the stepping stone for the scientific advice on which fisheries management decisions 
are based.  
 
We continue to seek ways of improving the timely submission of data as regards the 
unavoidable by-catches of Southern Bluefin Tuna taken by EU long line vessels in 
fisheries for swordfish and shark in the area. Great efforts are made to keep those by-
catches to the minimum. In 2010 by-catches of the EU fleets corresponded to a mere 
0.05% of total catches, and in 2011 this percentage is likely to be even lower, once 
by-catch figures have been finally revised. For any further improvements as regards 
reporting obligations, we look forward to working constructively with you in that 
regard.  
 
Finally, the EU would still very much like to extend its participation in CCSBT to full 
membership, and would as an initial step like to resume discussions on the possible 
admission of Regional Economic Integration Organisations to the Extended 
Commission.    
 
We look forward to participating in this meeting and hope it will be a productive and 
successful one. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by South Africa 
 
South Africa wishes to thank the Japanese government for hosting the 2012 Annual 
Meetings of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, and 
apologize for not being able to attend the Compliance Committee Meeting, which 
took place on the 27-29 September 2012. This was due to unfortunate and unforeseen 
administrative challenges that resulted in the South African delegation receiving 
official approval to attend the annual CCSBT meetings only on the 26 September 
2012. Nonetheless, we hope that our attendance at the Commission meeting would be 
indicative of our commitment to CCSBT.  
 
South Africa wishes to extend our gratitude to the secretariat for their efficiency, 
professionalism and the standard of quality in terms of their administrative assistance 
to member and non-member parties alike. We further wish to congratulate the newly 
appointed Compliance Manager, Ms Susie Iball, and are confident that her 
appointment will enhance the work of the secretariat. 
 
At the conclusion of the Commission meeting held in Bali last year the South African 
delegation undertook to discuss the proposed quota allocation for 2012-2014 with our 
principals and to report back to the secretariat. We apologize for not being able to 
report back sooner, but we need to explain the challenging situation we are faced 
with. The proposed increase, upon accession, in South Africa’s quota for 2013 and 
2014 was substantially lower than what South African delegation was mandated to 
request. Our principals view the proposed increase as not being economically viable 
for South Africa as a developing range state. This minimal increase does not 
recognize South Africa as only one of four range states with SBT occurring in its 
waters. Furthermore, this decision by member parties does not adequately 
acknowledge the sovereign right of South Africa under UNCLOS as a coastal state to 
harvest marine resources occurring within the EEZ. The view of our principals is that 
we as South Africa have done more than is necessary to co-operate with CCSBT, but 
the co-operation by its members has not been adequately acknowledged, and neither 
are the benefits of accession clear under the proposed current quota allocation. South 
Africa’s co-operation is clearly evident in the measures implemented to manage its 
small bluefin allocation, including but not limited to: mandatory VMS for all vessels, 
largest on board scientific observer programme of all CCSBT parties, on board 
logbooks, electronic landing summaries, and independent monitoring of all landings 
and transshipments in port. Moreover, South Africa at its own cost has voluntarily 
implemented port state measures to specifically monitor and manage bluefin landed 
and transshipped by foreign vessels using our ports. Given the above, our principals 
are still debating the merits of South Africa’s accession to CCSBT. 
 
South Africa on a number of occasions raised its dissatisfaction with the lack of 
transparency pertaining to decisions affecting it and would hope that in going forward 
this will be addressed by the members of CCSBT.  
 
In conclusion, we wish to assure the Commission that South Africa remains 
committed to conservation and management measures of CCSBT. We have noted the 
report of the seventh meeting of the Compliance Committee and are willing to 
respond in the course of this meeting to any questions countries may have pertaining 
to South Africa’s compliance record.  
 
We are hopeful that despite our shortened stay in Takamatsu we will nonetheless find 
the opportunity to explore this interesting city. 
 
Thank you Chair. 
Attachment 6-1 
 
Opening Statement by Fisheries Development Council International 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates from members, cooperating non-members and 
observers, 
 
It is an honor for the Fisheries Development Council International (FDCI) to have the 
opportunity of attending this meeting as an observer. One of the main objectives of the 
FDCI is to promote sustainable utilization of fisheries resources through international 
cooperation and information exchange, whereby ensuring the contribution of fisheries 
to food security and global socio-economy of the fishing community. 
 
FDCI appreciates the work of CCSBT in adopting conservation and management 
measures to ensure the sustainability of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT). The adoption 
of the Management Procedure by CCSBT in 2011 for developing a guideline in 
setting global total allowable catch (TAC) of SBT was a step forward for the 
conservation of SBT which is on the brink of depletion. Nevertheless, the parameters 
of MP is to rebuild the status of stock to an interim building target reference point of 
20% of the original spawning stock biomass by 2035. In our view, it seems to be too 
long a time to rebuild a stock which has been overfished. The same phenomena  
happened in other oceans. We should not wait for the repetition of the same history. In 
order that SBT stock may have a better chance to rebuild, more drastic measures 
should be taken before it is too late.  
 
Effective implementation of the measures adopted by CCSBT is also one of the major 
concerns. A paper reports it is believed that substantial quantity of SBT has been 
imported by non-members of CCSBT who may not require to comply with the 
CCSBT catch documentation scheme, forming a loophole in the MCS work of the 
CCSBT. The Commission should take necessary measure to ensure that such loophole 
is patched.  
 
In ending, I would like to thank the government of Japan for the fine arrangement of 
this meeting, and wish this meeting to be a successful one. Thank you.  
 
Attachment 6-2 
 
Opening Statement by Humane Society International 
 
Humane Society International (HSI) would like to thank the Commission for the 
opportunity to participate as an observer to these important discussions. Agreement on 
the Management Procedure (MP) by members at CCSBT18 was a significant 
achievement, which hopefully will be rewarded by progressive evidence of SBT stock 
recovery. HSI is highly supportive of the MP aimed at ensuring most reliable SBT 
stock recovery in the shortest time interval possible. However, HSI is most concerned 
for the potential this situation has for causing the fishery to impact even more on 
Ecologically Related Species (ERS). It can therefore be argued that efforts to 
ameliorate fishery impacts must be accelerated. Australia’s recreational SBT catch 
and the potential for recent trawl fishery developments to impact on SBT prey species 
stocks in southern Australia are emerging issues that warrant attention of CCSBT 
members, yet must not be allowed to overshadow long-standing management 
deficiencies. Of note here in particular is that of bycatch. HSI considers there to be an 
urgent need to identify mechanisms to ensure compliance with bycatch management 
requirements. In relation to this, I would like to draw members attention to paragraph 
57 of the CC7 report. 
 
Deliberations over the MP were somewhat protracted and a focus of members, to the 
extent that in the opinion of HSI the other management issues of the fishery did not 
progress in a satisfactory manner. Tangible progress to address key issues such as 
minimizing seabird bycatch and to better manage shark and other ERS bycatch has 
certainly been lacking. This situation was made quite clear in the recent IUCN review 
(Performance assessment of Bycatch and Discards Governance by Regional Fisheries 
Management Organisations1) in which CCSBT scored so poorly. This review, 
however, preceded the considerable and ongoing intercessional effort noted by HSI of 
the CCSBT Secretariat in developing systems to assist members to provide more 
accurate, consistent and comprehensive reporting on their fishing operations. It should 
now be more apparent as to precisely which members, and in what way, performance 
improvement is required. The IUCN Review considers ‘legally binding conservation 
and management measures, with measurable, quantitative performance standards are 
necessary to mitigate problematic effects of bycatch and guide adaptive management’. 
This is reflected in paragraph 61 of the CC7 report. 
 
The Review further states that ‘to achieve compliance with bycatch control measures, 
RFMO’s require effective surveillance and enforcement frameworks’. It is in this area 
that HSI encourages a focus of consideration by members, and in particular to ensure 
there is compliance with bycatch management requirements. Without this, future 
increase of TAC within the provisions of the MP must be suspended as a measure to 
prevent a concurrent longline bycatch increase. Remember, that for every two tonnes 
TAC increase no less than 1 more albatross will be killed on longlines. 
 
RFMO’s that have overlapping jurisdiction with CCSBT recently introduced more 
effective seabird bycatch mitigation regulations which CCSBT vessels are required to 
                                                            
1 Gilman, E., Passfield, K., Nakamura, K. 2012. Performance Assessment of Bycatch and Discards Governance by 
Regional Fisheries Management Organizations. IUCN, Gland, Switzerland, ix + 484 pp. 
now implement. It is therefore necessary for CCSBT to amend its specific seabird 
bycatch regulations. I draw members attention to the 6th recommendation of the 
ERSWG9, one that members are urged to adopt at this meeting. The amendment will 
create new compliance verification needs and opportunities such as appropriate use of 
VMS to establish line-setting pattern with respect to time of day together with at-sea 
and port inspections of specific gear types such as line weighting for seabird bycatch 
avoidance. This issue unfortunately was not considered by the CC7 meeting which is 
reflected in paragraph 60 of its report. Compliance verification methods and targets 
for members to meet need to be developed, as do adequate coverage observer 
programs as described by Australia (CCSBT/CC/1110/19 pg.9). The observer 
coverage is essential for measuring mitigation efficacy and needs to be adequate so 
that scientific advice can be given with statistical confidence. Perhaps the only option 
to achieve this is to scale back longline fishing effort through TAC reductions so as to 
fit available budgets for observer coverage at the necessary level.  
 
Finally, we again urge members to follow the most conservative provisions of the MP 
as a means of containing bycatch levels for as long as the current uncertainty about 
levels of compliance remains and to also allow SBT stocks greater recovery prospects.  
 
Thank you Chair and members for your time.  
 
Attachment 6-3 
 
Opening Statement by TRAFFIC 
 
Thank you Mr. Chairman. 
 
TRAFFIC and WWF thank the Commission for the opportunity to participate as 
observers to meetings of the Commission and the Extended Commission.  We look 
forward to contributing to these critical deliberations.   
 
We continue to note with great concern that the southern bluefin tuna (SBT) spawning 
biomass remains at a very small percentage of its original biomass, but welcome the 
adoption in 2011 of the management procedure which has an interim rebuilding target 
of 20% of the original spawning biomass by 2035 and sets out to achieve that with a 
70% probability. We urge the Commission to ensure it strictly adheres to the interim 
rebuilding target. 
 
With the matter of an interim target now resolved, it is a priority that the Commission 
moves to define the long term target for the SBT stock. In particular, the Commission 
must determine the percentage of the original spawning biomass that the stock must 
be rebuilt to which would ensure it returns to a biologically safe level quickly and 
consistent with the application of the precautionary principle. 
 
In regard to ecologically related species, while there has been some attention given to 
progressing this in CCSBT, there is still a long way to go before a sense of 
achievement can be acknowledged. One only has to look at Attachment A of the paper 
before this meeting which examines compliance with management measures to see 
the very limited adherence by members and cooperating nonmembers to information 
provision. Therefore, we support the recommendations for better data exchange and 
encourage the Commission to consider adopting the bycatch recommendations from 
the Kobe process and adopting them through a binding measure. 
 
Lastly, we note the importance of accounting for all mortalities in this fishery. The 
Secretariat’s comparative CDS and trade work, and our genetics work identifying 
SBT products in China, highlights the need for the Commission to ensure all those 
catching and trading SBT are either members or cooperating with the Commission 
and that they are abiding by the measures agreed by the Commission. In addition, 
while non-commercial catch of SBT is limited to only a small number of members, 
New Zealand since 2004 has accounted for this catch within its allocation, whereas 
Australia fails to do so. Australia’s non-commercial catch in 2011 was in excess of 
240 tonnes, a substantial amount in light of the status of the stock and the need to 
include all mortalities within the framework of the management procedure. There is 
no exemption for non-commercial catch against allocations under the convention. We 
therefore ask the Commission to ensure through a statement at this Extended 
Commission meeting that any future non-compliance in this way would be dealt with 
seriously and would be considered IUU catch. 
 
We urge Members to make the necessary decisions, with the required sense of 
urgency, to conserve effectively SBT and other ecologically related species, 
especially sharks, seabirds and marine turtles. 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
1 Mr. Paul Ross (Australia) was agreed by Members to be the Chair of the Finance 
and Administration Committee (FAC). The Chair proposed a general agenda, 
which was agreed by the FAC. 
 
2 The FAC discussed the revised budget for 2012, and the proposed budget for 
2013, including the Australian proposal for the Commission to fund the scientific 
aerial survey, additional activities recommended by the Compliance Committee 
and the possible creation of a Contributions Stabilisation Fund.  The FAC also 
considered possible assistance to developing Members and CNMs. 
 
The revised budget for 2012 
 
3 The Executive Secretary gave a summary of the 2012 revised budget, highlighting 
the savings that had been made in particular in the recruitment of the Compliance 
Manager and the holding of the Compliance Committee and Extended 
Commission meetings. The revised budget was provided in paper CCSBT-
EC/1210/05. It is proposed that the surplus of $387,977 be carried into the 2013 
budget as income. The FAC thanked the Executive Secretary for the work done on 
the budget. 
 
4 The FAC recommends that the revised budget for 2012 at Annex A be agreed by 
the Extended Commission. 
 
The proposed budget for 2013 
 
5 The FAC considered the proposed budget for 2013 as outlined in CCSBT-
EC/1210/06. The FAC took into consideration the proposal in the document to 
establish a Contributions Stabilisation Fund (CSF), using the expected surplus to 
be carried over from 2012.  The FAC also considered the revised draft general 
budget prepared by the Executive Secretary which included the additional 
activities recommended by the Compliance Committee.  
 
6 The Executive Secretary explained that the draft 2013 budget presented in 
CCSBT-EC/1210/06 had decreased by approximately 4% compared to the 2012 
budget largely because of an overall reduction in expected meeting costs for next 
year.  Because of exceptional savings achieved during 2012 as explained in 
document CCSBT-EC/1210/05, an estimated amount of approximately $220,000 
was available to be used in a CSF. 
 
7 The FAC recommends to the EC that the additional activities proposed by the 
Compliance Committee be funded in the 2013 budget, namely the trial Quality 
Assurance Review, inter-sessional compliance work and a compliance workshop. 
 
8 The FAC considered the proposed meeting program for 2013.  The FAC  
recommends to the Extended Commission, that: 
(i) 
A three day Compliance Committee Working Group (CCWG) meeting be 
held in Canberra on a date to be decided in April or May 2013.  Australia 
will seek to secure a free venue and if successful, it is expected savings 
will be achieved. 
(ii) 
The next meeting of the ERSWG be held back to back with the extended 
Scientific Committee in Canberra in late August/early September.  This 
would result is a saving of approximately $45,000 that can be used to 
partially offset costs of the CCWG.  In order to provide ERS data in 
advance of the meeting, Members agreed to exchange the ERS data 
specified in the agreed ERSWG Data Exchange for 2010 and 2011 by 
30 April 2013.  In accordance with the agreed ERSWG Data Exchange 
proposal, data for 2012 would not be required to be exchanged until 
31 July 2013. 
(iii) 
A four day scientific technical meeting be held in Portland, Maine USA 
(22-25 July 2013) in the week following the World Conference on Stock 
Assessment Methods to be held in Boston USA.  A number of the 
expected participants in the technical meeting will be attending the 
Conference. 
(iv) 
 The annual meetings of the Extended Scientific Committee, Compliance 
Committee and Extended Commission be planned and budgeted as 
proposed in CCSBT-EC/1210/06. 
 
9 The FAC noted the Scientific Committee’s advice that a three member 
independent Advisory Panel would continue to be needed for 2013 but that the 
full four member panel plus consultant is likely to be required for 2014.  The FAC 
recommends that the Extended Commission continue to fund a three member 
Advisory Panel in 2013, and draws attention that additional funds would need to 
be allocated in 2014 to cover the cost of the extra member and consultant in that 
year.  
 
Shared funding of scientific aerial survey 
 
10 The FAC discussed Australia’s proposal for the Commission to take over the 
funding of the scientific aerial survey.  Members acknowledged that the aerial 
survey was the only fishery independent data used by the Commission in its stock 
assessment work and that a way should be found for the Commission to fund this 
work in the future.  It was noted that because of the budgetary constraints faced by 
some Members, it was not possible to agree to fully fund the survey work at this 
time.  Australia put forward a proposal whereby members would partially fund the 
survey.  Following discussion, the FAC agreed to recommend to the Extended 
Commission that an amount of $100,000 be made available in the 2013 budget to 
partially fund the aerial survey work. 
 
11 It was further agreed that payment of the amount of $100,000 towards the costs of 
the scientific aerial survey would be made by the Secretariat to the Australian 
Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) on receipt 
of an invoice from DAFF and notification to the Secretariat by DAFF of 
successful completion of the scientific aerial survey. 
Assistance to developing Members and CNMs 
 
12 The FAC agreed that an amount of $12,500 should be allocated in the 2013 
General Budget to assist developing Members and CNMs by supporting their 
attendance in relevant workshops and to also be used by the Commission to fund 
workshops held for developing Members and CNMs. 
 
13 Developing Members and CNMs can apply intersessionally to use the funds and 
the Secretariat would provide those funds subject to inter-sessional agreement by 
the Members. 
 
Establishment of a Contributions Stabilisation Fund 
 
14 The FAC noted that once the additional items above are included in the draft 
budget, a surplus for use in a CSF no longer exists.  The FAC therefore 
recommends to the Extended Commission that the establishment of a CSF not be 
considered at this time. 
 
Recommended Budget 2013 
 
15 The FAC agreed to recommend the General Budget for the Extended 
Commission in 2013 as set out in Annex B to this document.  The Extended 
Commission is asked to note that the recommended Budget will result in a 5% 
increase in Member contributions.

Recommendation Draft Resolution to Mitigate the Impact on Ecologically 
Related Species of Fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Concerned that some seabird species, notably albatrosses and petrels, are threatened 
with global extinction, 
 
Mindful that fishing for southern bluefin tuna can also cause incidental harm to other 
species such as sea turtles and sharks, 
 
Recalling the definition of ecologically related species in Article 2 of the Convention 
for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Further recalling the requirement in Article 5(2) of the Convention for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna that the Parties shall expeditiously provide to 
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna data on, inter alia, 
ecologically related species. 
 
Determined to mitigate incidental harm to ecologically related species caused by 
fishing for southern bluefin tuna, 
 
Noting the importance of harmonising conservation and management measures with 
other organisations responsible for managing international fisheries, as agreed at the 
Kobe Meeting of Joint Tuna RFMOs on 26 January 2007, 
 
Reaffirming the recommendation at the seventh meeting of the Ecologically Related 
Species Working Group (ERSWG) held in Tokyo from 3 to 6 July 2007, that 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members will provide national reports on their 
interactions with ecologically related species in southern bluefin tuna fisheries to the 
ERSWG, 
 
In accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8 of the Convention for the Conservation 
of Southern Bluefin Tuna, the Extended Commission adopts as follows: 
 
Recommends that: 
1. 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members will, to the extent possible, 
implement the International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catches of 
Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (IPOA-Seabirds), the International Plan of Action for 
the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA-Sharks), and the FAO Guidelines 
to reduce sea turtle mortality in fishing operations (FAO-Sea turtles), if they have not 
already done so. 
 
2. 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members will comply with all current binding 
and recommendatory measures aimed at the protection of ecologically related species, 
including seabirds, sea turtles and sharks, from fishing, which are adopted from time 
to time: 
a)  
by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, when fishing in its Convention 
area, 
b)  
by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, when fishing in 
its Convention area, and 
c)  
by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, 
when fishing in its Convention area irrespective of whether the Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member concerned is a member of the relevant 
Commission or otherwise cooperates with it. 
 
3. 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members will collect and report data on 
ecologically related species to the Extended Commission and/or its subsidiary bodies 
as appropriate, including the Ecologically Related Species Working Group. Further, 
the undertaking described in paragraph 2 will include a commitment to comply with 
measures adopted by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the Western and Central 
Pacific Fisheries Commission and the International Commission for the Conservation 
of Atlantic Tunas on the collection and reporting of data in relation to ecologically 
related species. Data confidentiality shall be protected under the rules that apply in 
those Commissions. 
 
4. 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members will report annually to the 
Compliance Committee of the Extended Commission on the action they have taken 
pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this recommendation. 
 
5. 
The Secretariat of the CCSBT is authorised to collect and exchange relevant 
data concerning ecologically related species with the Secretariat of the Indian Ocean 
Tuna Commission, the Secretariat of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 
Commission and the Secretariat of the International Commission for the Conservation 
of Atlantic Tunas. 
 
6. 
The Extended Commission will review the operation of this Recommendation 
with a view to enhancing the protection of ecologically related species from the 
impacts of fishing for southern bluefin tuna. 
 
7. 
The Extended Commission and/or its subsidiary bodies as appropriate will 
undertake an assessment of the risks to ecologically related species posed by fishing 
for southern bluefin tuna. The Extended Commission will consider how these risks are 
mitigated by the adoption of measures described at section 2, and will consider 
whether any additional measures to mitigate risk are required.

ERSWG Data Exchange 
 
Introduction 
The ERSWG Data Exchange is divided into three sections: 
1.  Data to be provided; 
2.  Frequency & timeframe for data provision; and 
3.  Confidentiality. 
 
The Data Exchange described here is intended for the sharing of information for “general” 
ERSWG purposes.  It is expected that the ERSWG will conduct assessments from time to 
time that will require more detailed information and CCSBT Members have expressed their 
willingness, in principle, to share more detailed information on a case by case basis with 
those who have been tasked with leading such assessments. 
1.  Data to be provided 
ERSWG 9 made three important recommendations to the Extended Commission that form 
the basis of this data exchange proposal.  These are that: 
• For the purpose of the ERS Data Exchange, the SBT fishery is defined as all fishing 
effort by authorised vessels1 for shots/sets where SBT was either targeted or caught2.  
Data for the full SBT fishery as defined here is to be provided as part of this data 
exchange.  Data should not be provided for fishing that does not match this definition. 
• Data is to be provided by stratum, with the default stratum being CCSBT statistical areas 
unless an analysis has shown that better strata could be defined for the ERS interactions 
in the national fishery. 
• The specific data items to be provided are as specified in Table 1 of the new ERSWG 
template for annual reports3, which are: 
o Country/Fishing Entity (suggest using 2 digit country code, e.g. “JP”) 
o Calendar year 
o Species (or group4) 
o Fishery (defined by a combination of gear and fleet – see Attachment A) 
o Stratum (CCSBT statistical area) 
o Total effort5 
o Total observed effort5 
o Observer coverage (percentage6) 
o Observed captures (number) 
o Observed capture rate7 
o Observed mortalities (number) 
o Observed mortality rate7 
o Observed number of live releases 
o Estimated total number of mortalities in year/stratum8 
For the actual exchange of data, the above data items will be provided in two separate 
tables as outlined in Attachment A.  This style of data provision would prevent double 
counting and possible confusion in relation to the effort information. 
 
                                                 
1 Authorised vessels are vessels on the CCSBT authorised list of vessels during the relevant calendar year. 
2 For clarification, it is intended that the only information that would be included in the exchange is information 
from those shots that targeted or caught SBT. Hence, if a bycatch vessel only caught 1 SBT for the year, it 
would only be data from that one SBT shot that would be included in the exchanged information. 
3 Attachment 4 of the ERSWG 9 report. 
4 Information should be provided by species (including the scientific name) wherever practical.  For species 
where species specific reporting is not practical (e.g. due to insufficient data, or the high level of work 
involved), then the level of taxonomic reporting should be at least to the level specified in Table 3.  The ideal 
way to provide species information would be to use the 3 alpha FAO Species Code.  If this is not possible, 
provide a code for the species and provide a separate lookup table that gives the species code, scientific and 
common names, family name etc.  
5 For longline provide number of hooks, for purse seine provide number of sets. 
6 For longline provide as a percentage of the number of hooks, for purse seine provide as a percentage of the 
number of shots. 
7 For longline provide as captures/mortalities per thousand hooks, for purse seine provide as captures/mortalities 
per set. 
8 In cases where there is no estimate for the total number of mortalities (e.g. due to no or insufficient observer 
coverage in the strata), then this field should be left empty. 
To be consistent with standard practise of the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC): 
• Data will be provided for the most recently completed calendar year (e.g. the 2013 data 
exchange would provide data for the 2012 calendar year); and 
• The data exchange will include any updates for the previous calendar year (i.e. the 2013 
data exchange would also include revised data for 2011). 
 
For the very first exchange of data: 
• Data for 2010 and 2011 will be provided by 30 April 2013 for all species9; and 
• Data for 2012 will be provided by 31 July 2013. 
 
For an initial period after the first data exchange (possibly 3 years, but still to be determined), 
Members will work towards improving the quality of their data and they will be able to revise 
any submitted data with improved information during this period.  After this initial period of 
data improvement, changes to past data should be accompanied by an explanation of the 
changes. 
 
 
2.  Frequency & timeframe for data provision 
Consistent with standard practise of the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC), it is proposed 
that: 
• The ERS data exchange occurs on an annual basis, regardless of whether there is an 
ERSWG meeting in that year10. 
• The required ERS data is submitted to the Secretariat by 31 July. 
 
 
3.  Confidentiality 
The data will be treated in accordance with the “Rules and Procedures for the Protection, 
Access to, and Dissemination of Data Compiled by the CCSBT” and will be rated as 
“medium risk”.  This means that the data will not be publicly available, and that they require 
specific authorisation to be released and may not be placed on the CCSBT Data CD or on the 
private area of the CCSBT web site (unless in a special part of the private area that is further 
restricted to specifically authorised people). 
 
It is envisaged that the Secretariat would load exchanged ERS data to a special section of the 
private area of the web site titled “ERSWG Data Exchange” that only people with specific 
authorisation can access.
                                                 
9 It may be useful to have a longer time-series of data, but there will almost certainly be problems in the first 
data submission so it makes sense to keep the initial time-series short while these problems are “ironed-out”.  
Discussion on whether or not a longer time-series is necessary could take place at an ERSWG meeting after the 
initial data submission. 
10 For data required as part of the CCSBT Management Procedure, the ESC decided that these data should be 
provided every year despite these data only being required every third year.  This was to ensure that the skills 
and knowledge required to provide the necessary data were retained and so that there would be very few 
problems in provision of that data when required.  This has proved to be a successful strategy for the ESC that 
makes equally good sense for an ERS Data Exchange. 
 
 
Attachment A 
Proposed Format for Providing Data for the ERSWG Data Exchange 
 
The information should be provided in electronic form in two separate tables (e.g. 2 MS-Excel spreadsheets) as described below.  The common 
columns in the two tables are highlighted in yellow.

12 The codes (1-15) are defined in the CCSBT CDS Resolution. 
13 Use the gear codes described in the CCSBT CDS Resolution (e.g. “LL” for longline, “PS” for purse seine, “TROL” for troll, etc.) 
14 In most cases, this is just the two digit country code, followed by “D” for domestic for the domestic fleet (e.g. AUD, IDD, JPD, KRD, NZD, TWD, ZAD and PHD).  In 
some cases, the final letter is different, such as for the New Zealand Charter Fleet, which has the code “NZC”.  Contact the Secretariat if in doubt. 
Table 3:  Minimum taxonomic level at which information should be reported in Table 2 (providing that such taxonomic detail is available)15.  
Information should be provided to species level where this is practical.  Reporting of any of the following species and/or groups within table 2 
should include an appropriate stratification of the data.  
 
Species/Species Group Comments 
Sharks 
 
Blue Shark  
Shortfin Mako Shark  
Porbeagle  
Other sharks  
Turtles 
For sea turtles, the number of species is small (approximately 7), so it is feasible to report data by stratum for 
each species. 
Species specific Data should be provided separately for each species 
Seabirds 
For seabirds, there are a large number of species and it is often difficult to separately identify species by 
pictures only.  Reporting of seabird data by species would contain identification errors. 
Large albatrosses Including: Wandering, Tristan, New Zealand, Antipodean, Southern Royal, and Northern Royal 
Dark coloured albatrosses Including: Sooty and Light-mantled 
Other albatrosses Including: Black-browed, Campbell, Grey-headed, Atlantic yellow-nosed, Indian yellow-nosed, Buller's, Shy, 
Salvin's, Chatham and White-capped 
Giant petrels Including: White-chinned petrel, Grey petrel, Flesh-footed shearwater etc. 
Other seabirds Including: Skua etc. 
 
 
 
                                                 
15 The minimum taxonomic level will be subject to improvement (become more species specific) in future.  Furthermore the ERSWG might recommend specific species to be reported based on 
risk assessments or based on advice it may seek from organisations with the necessary expertise.

Resolution on Reporting all Sources of Mortality of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
(Adopted at the nineteenth Annual Meeting – 1-4 October 2012) 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Recalling previous agreement by Members and Cooperating Non-Members to report 
all sources of mortality of southern bluefin tuna recorded in the report of Eleventh 
Commission Meeting and the Fifth Compliance Committee Meeting; 
 
Considering the value Members and Cooperating Non-Members see in recording 
these previous commitments in a resolution of the Extended Commission to ensure 
the data and reporting requirements for all sources of mortality are clear; 
 
Further recalling the CCSBT Strategic Plan adopted at the 2011 Special Meeting of 
the Extended Commission; 
 
Noting that in the Strategic Plan Members and Cooperating Non-Members accorded 
‘very high priority’ to agreeing rules that ensure members report accurate and 
complete data on all sources of mortality for southern bluefin tuna; 
 
Recognising the importance that this data is considered by the Extended Scientific 
Committee; 
 
Agrees in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8, that: 
1. All Members and Cooperating Non-Members shall, subject to paragraph 2, report 
accurate and complete data on the quantity of all sources of southern bluefin tuna 
mortality in their national reports presented to the Extended Commission. 
2. If a Member or Cooperating Non-Member is unable to provide complete and 
accurate data as required in paragraph 1 of this resolution, they shall report a best 
estimate of all sources of southern bluefin tuna mortality in their national report to 
the Extended Commission. 
3. For the purposes of this resolution “all sources of mortality” shall be understood to 
include, but not be limited to, discards and recreational fishing, including the fate 
–live and vigorous; moribund; dead – of these sources of southern bluefin tuna. 
4. The Secretariat will expand the table of compliance with measures, which is 
currently provided by the Secretariat to the annual Compliance Committee, to 
accommodate the reporting of all sources of southern bluefin tuna mortality. 
5. The Extended Scientific Committee shall incorporate the data on all sources of 
southern bluefin mortality provided in Member’s and Cooperating Non-Member’s 
national reports into their work, including future assessments. 
Attachment 14 
 
DRAFT RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH AN EXTENDED COMMISSION AND AN 
EXTENDED SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE 
 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (the Commission): 
 
RECOGNISING that ensuring the sustainability of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) 
stock requires that all those States, regional economic integration organisations and 
entities or fishing entities fishing this species work together through the Commission; 
 
CONSIDERING that continued fishing for SBT by States, regional economic 
integration organisations and entities or fishing entities not adhering to the 
Commission's conservation and management measures substantially diminishes the 
effectiveness of those measures; 
 
RECOGNISING the continuing need to encourage all States eligible to accede to the 
Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (the Convention) to do so, 
and to encourage regional economic integration organisations and entities or fishing 
entities with vessels fishing for SBT to implement the Commission's conservation and 
management measures; 
 
Decides as follows: 
1. Acting under Articles 8.3(b) and 15.4 of the Convention, the Commission hereby 
establishes an Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
(the Extended Commission) and an Extended Scientific Committee, whose Members 
shall be comprised of the Parties to the Convention and any regional economic 
integration organisation, entity or fishing entity, vessels flagged to which1 have caught 
SBT at any time in the previous three calendar years, that is admitted to membership by 
the Extended Commission pursuant to this Resolution. 
 
2. The Extended Commission and the Extended Scientific Committee shall perform 
the same tasks as the Commission and the Scientific Committee including, but not 
limited to, deciding upon a total allowable catch and its allocation among the Members. 
All Members shall have equal voting rights.  A regional economic integration organisation 
that is a Member shall have one vote and its member States shall have no right to vote in the 
Extended Commission. The provisions of the Convention relating to the Commission and the 
Scientific Committee (Articles 6 to 9, except for 6.9 and 6.10) shall apply mutatis mutandis 
with regard to the Extended Commission and the Extended Scientific Committee. Any 
dispute concerning the interpretation or implementation of this Resolution, including the 
articles of the Convention specified in the Resolution, or the Exchange of Letters referred to 
in paragraph 6, shall be resolved by negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration 
or other peaceful means agreed by the parties to the dispute. 
 
3. The Secretariat of the Commission shall function as the Secretariat of the Extended 
Commission.  
 
 
                                                            
1 Including vessels flagged to a State that is a Member of the regional economic integration organisation. 
4. The Extended Commission shall report forthwith to the Commission if the latter is 
in session, and in any other case before the latter’s next meeting or session of a meeting, 
all decisions it adopts. Decisions so reported shall become decisions of the 
Commission at the end of the session of the meeting to which they were reported, unless 
the Commission decides to the contrary. Any decision of the Commission that affects 
the operation of the Extended Commission or the rights, obligations or status of any 
individual Member within the Extended Commission should not be taken without prior 
due deliberation of that issue by the Extended Commission. 
 
5. The Rules of Procedure for the Extended Commission shall be as annexed to this 
Resolution. Any revision to the Rules shall be made by the Extended Commission. 
 
6. Any regional economic integration organisation, entity or fishing entity, vessels 
flagged to which1 have caught SBT at any time in the previous three calendar years, 
may express its willingness to the Executive Secretary of the Commission to become a 
member of the Extended Commission. The Executive Secretary of the Commission, 
on behalf of the Commission, will conduct an Exchange of Letters with the 
representative of such regional economic integration organisation, entity or fishing 
entity to this effect. In so doing, the applicant shall give the Commission its firm 
commitment to respect the terms of the Convention and comply with such decisions of 
the Extended Commission as become decisions of the Commission pursuant to 
paragraph 4. 
 
7. If the Extended Commission decides to admit the applicant, it shall negotiate with 
the applicant a formula to govern the level of catch of SBT by the applicant pending the 
next decision of the Commission setting a total allowable catch and its allocation among 
the Members. Upon the successful completion of the negotiations referred to in the 
previous sentence, the Executive Secretary will exchange letters with the applicant as 
referred to in paragraph 6; the applicant shall thereupon assume the status of Member of 
the Extended Commission. 
 
8. Any Member of the Extended Commission that is not a Member of the 
Commission shall be entitled to appoint one representative, to be accompanied by 
experts and advisers, as an Observer to meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary 
bodies, including the Scientific Committee. Such representative shall be entitled to be 
present and speak as an Observer at meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary 
bodies. 
 
9. The Extended Commission shall decide upon an annual budget. The 
contributions to the budget of an applicant that is admitted as its Member shall be 
determined by application mutatis mutandis of Article 11 of the Convention. 
 
10. The provisions of this Resolution relating to participation by regional economic 
integration organisations and entities or fishing entities in the operations of the 
Extended Commission are solely for the purposes of the Convention. 
 
11.  For the purposes of this Resolution, ‘regional economic integration organisation’ means 
a regional economic integration organisation to which its member States have transferred 
competence over matters covered by the Convention, including the authority to make 
decisions binding on its member States in respect of those matters.   
 
11. The Rules of Procedure are amended by omitting paragraph 3 of Rule 5 and 
substituting the following: 
 
“3. A provisional agenda for each annual meeting shall be prepared by the Executive 
Secretary in consultation with the Chair. The provisional agenda shall be despatched 
by the Executive Secretary to all the Members not less than 60 days before the date for 
the opening of the meeting. The provisional agenda shall include: 
(a) approval of decisions taken by the Extended Commission; 
(b) all items which the Commission has previously decided to include in the 
provisional agenda; and 
(c) all supplementary items the inclusion of which have been requested by any 
Member of the Commission 
RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE EXTENDED COMMISSION FOR THE 
CONSERVATION OF SOUTHERN BLUEFIN TUNA 
 
Rule 1 
Representation 
1. Each Member shall be represented on the Extended Commission by not more than 
three delegates who may be accompanied by experts and advisers. Each Member shall 
inform the Executive Secretary of the Extended Commission of the names of its 
delegates to the Extended Commission including identification of the head of the 
delegation and experts and advisers accompanying such delegates, and of any change 
thereof, as far in advance as possible before the commencement of each meeting of the 
Extended Commission. 
 
2. Each Member shall designate a correspondent who shall have primary 
responsibility for liaison with the Executive Secretary during the periods between 
meetings and shall promptly inform the Executive Secretary of the name and address of 
such a correspondent and of any change thereof. 
 
Rule 2 
Other matters 
 
Except for Rule 4(3) and Rule 9, the Rules of Procedure of the Commission for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna apply mutatis mutandis to the Extended Commission 
on other matters, subject to the following amendments:. 
 
(a) Replace Rule 2(1) with the following: 
 
‘Until such time as a Secretariat is established and the location of the headquarters of the 
Extended Commission is determined, the annual meetings of the Extended Commission 
shall be hosted by one of the Members by rotation or as otherwise agreed.’ 
 
(b) Replace Rule 2(b) with the following: 
 
‘After a Secretariat has been established and the location of the headquarters of the 
Extended Commission has been determined, each annual meeting of the Extended 
Commission shall be hosted by one of the Members by rotation.  In the event that a 
Member does not wish to host an annual meeting, that meeting shall be held at the 
headquarters of the Extended Commission, unless otherwise decided by the Extended 
Commission.’ 
 
Rule 3 
Co-operating Non-Members 
A State, regional economic integration organisation or entity that is admitted to the 
Extended Commission in the capacity of a co-operating non-member will have the right 
to participate actively in meetings of the Extended Commission, the Extended Scientific 
Committee and their subsidiary bodies, including, but not limited to, the right to make 
proposals and the right to speak, but not to vote. The Extended Commission may 
decide to restrict the participation of a cooperating non-member in a particular Agenda 
item. 
Attachment 15 
 
Clarification from the EU on the draft amendment to the Resolution on the Extended 
Commission 
 
The decision-making principle established in the CCSBT Convention is that one Contracting 
Party has one vote. Therefore, if the EU were to become a Contracting Party, if the 
Convention one day would be amended to allow REIOs to become Contracting Parties, then 
the EU would have one vote in the Commission and one vote in the Extended Commission.  
Participation in CCSBT falls under so-called exclusive competence of the EU, which means 
that it is considered a matter over which Member States of the EU have transferred their 
competence to the EU, as explained in the definition of REIO in the new point 11 of the draft 
amended Resolution to establish and Extended Commission, as reflected in Attachment 14.  
 
Therefore the addition in point 2 of the draft amended Resolution to establish and Extended 
Commission, as reflected in Attachment 14: "and its Member States shall have no right to 
vote in the Extended Commission" is in principle not necessary, as the situation where the 
EU and a Member State of the EU in its own right would be members of the Extended 
Commission and the Commission respectively at the same time would not occur. 
The only situation where this situation might occur would be the situation where a Member 
State of the EU was to become a Contracting Party to CCSBT in representation of one of its 
territories which is not part of the EU. As such territories, so-called ‘overseas countries and 
territories’, are not part of the EU, that EU Member State would be entitled to have one vote 
both in the Commission and in the Extended Commission, on behalf of its territory and not as 
an EU Member State in its own right, regardless of the text added in point 2. This is for 
example the case for France and the UK in ICCAT, for France in IOTC and WCPFC, and for 
France and Denmark in NAFO.

Report from the CCSBT observer to meetings of the Western and Central 
Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) held since CCSBT18 
 
1. At CCSBT 18 it was agreed that New Zealand would again act as observer to meetings of 
the WCPFC in 2012.  The following meetings of WCPFC have taken place since 
CCSBT18. 
• Annual Commission meeting 26-30 March in Guam, USA (WCPFC8) 
• A meeting of the Scientific Committee 7-15 August in Busan, Korea 
• A meeting of the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC) overlaps with 
CCSBT19 (27 September-2 October) 
Annual Commission meeting 
2. The planned December 2011 meeting of WCPFC was postponed to March 2012.  With a 
very full agenda, WCPFC struggled to address the core business of this meeting which 
was to decide on a new conservation and management measure (CMM) for bigeye, 
yellowfin and skipjack.  Current scientific advice is that the CMM agreed in 2008 
(CMM2008-01) has not been successful in reducing overfishing of bigeye tuna.  The 
WCPFC has also agreed that measures should be applied throughout its convention area 
for skipjack. 
 
3. While considerable progress was made, WCPFC was not able to finalise development of 
a new CMM and instead agreed to extend major components of the existing measure for a 
further year (CMM2011-01).   Work is continuing on a new measure for consideration 
when the Commission meets again in December 2012. 
 
4. WCPFC did agree to a prohibition on the retention of oceanic whitetip shark (to apply 
from 1 January 2013) and discussed a range of administrative and infrastructural issues.  
A key issue raised by Pacific Island states was the need to apply further management 
controls on the south Pacific albacore stock to maintain the economic viability of their 
longline fisheries which rely on albacore as a key target species. 
 
5. Another issue that attracted considerable debate at WCPFC8 was in relation to requests 
by Pacific Island countries for access to WCPFC VMS data for vessels entering and/or 
adjacent to their EEZs.  There was no resolution to this issue and it will be considered 
again at the TCC and at WCPFC9.  There was further progress on the development of a 
compliance monitoring report which presents a summary of the implementation status of 
WCPFC CMMs. 
Scientific Committee (SC) 
                                        
 
 
 
 
 
6. Key WCPFC tuna stocks are taken as a bycatch of SBT longline fisheries.  The status of 
these stocks is therefore a matter of relevance to CCSBT. 
7. A general overview of the fisheries and the economics were presented.  The provisional 
total Western and Central Pacific convention area (WCP–CA) tuna catch for 2011 was 
estimated at 2,244,776 t, the lowest since 2005 and 300,000 t lower than the record in 
2009 (2,544,679 t).  This catch represented 79% of the total Pacific Ocean catch of 
2,833,020 t, and 55% of the global tuna catch (the provisional estimate for 2011 is 
4,077,814 t, which is the lowest for 10 years).

Pacific albacore component was

8. No new stock assessments for skipjack, yellowfin or bigeye were undertaken in 2012.  
The assessed status of these stocks remains the same as reported to CCSBT18 as follows: 
 
• Skipjack: the largest fishery by volume is assessed as not overfished and no 
overfishing occurring at current levels of fishing effort.   
 
• Bigeye tuna: The SC considered the results of a review of the 2011 stock assessment 
of bigeye which concluded that the assessment was robust but made some 
recommendations for improvements in future assessments.  Bigeye tuna is currently 
assessed as not overfished but overfishing is occurring. 
 
• Yellowfin tuna: Yellowfin tuna is assessed as not overfished and overfishing is not 
occurring according to base case estimates, however the SC recommends that there be 
no increase in fishing effort in the equatorial region of the fishery.  
 
• Albacore tuna: A new assessment of the southwest Pacific albacore stock was 
reported to the 2012 SC.  The results were generally similar to the 2011 assessment 
that the stock is not overfished and no overfishing was occurring.  The SC did note 
that if catch rates were to remain at economic levels a reduction in current catch 
would be required.  
 
                                        
 
 
 
 
9. An issue for CCSBT to note is that fleets that target south Pacific albacore in the southern 
high seas of the WCP-CA may well take southern bluefin tuna as a bycatch. 
 
10. Assessments were also reported for silky and oceanic whitetip sharks and south Pacific 
striped marlin. The assessment of oceanic whitetip shark confirmed the need for the 
action taken by WCPFC 8 to prohibit the retention of this species from 1 January 2013.  
ISC is to assess the Pacific bluefin tuna stock (the distribution overlaps southern bluefin 
tuna in some areas of the fishery) in 2013. Full reporting of the 2012 assessments is to be 
found at www.wcpfc.int when the science committee report is finalised.  
Seabirds 
11. The SC considered a report from ACAP on best practise seabird mitigation techniques.  
In relation to the southern hemisphere (an area of overlap with the southern bluefin tuna 
fishery) The SC has recommended that fisheries south of 30o S are required to use at least 
two of these three measures: weighted branch lines, night setting and bird scaring lines. 
This advice will be considered by both the TCC and the Commission in December of this 
year.

REPORT FROM THE CCSBT OBSERVER (AUSTRALIA) TO THE  
30TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE COMMISSION FOR THE  
CONSERVATION OF ANTARCTIC MARINE LIVING RESOURCES 
1. The thirtieth meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living 
Resources (CCAMLR XXX) was held in Hobart, Tasmania from 24 October to  
4 November 2011. 
2. The following Members of the Commission were represented: Argentina, Australia, 
Belgium, Brazil, People’s Republic of China (hereafter referred to as China), Chile, 
European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Namibia, New 
Zealand, Norway, Poland, Russian Federation, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America and 
Uruguay. The Netherlands attended as a Contracting Party with observer status. The 
Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC) and the Coalition of Legal Toothfish 
Operators (COLTO) attended as invited NGO observers. Several international 
organisations were also represented. There were no non-Contracting Parties with observer 
status present.  
Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing 
3. The Commission noted that there is no evidence to suggest that IUU fishing has declined 
and that it continues at a relatively low level, although it was possible it was increasing 
and that the spatial distribution of IUU fishing may be changing.  
4. The Commission agreed that, given the uncertainty surrounding gillnet catch rates, future 
estimates of IUU should focus on the level of effort, rather the level of catches although 
estimates of total removals are needed for stock assessments. The Commission noted that 
gillnets were of particular concern due to the potential impacts on by-catch species and 
benthic ecosystems and suggested that further information could be obtained from other 
organisations, such as IOTC, where gillnets are reported to be used. 
Performance Review 
5. The Commission considered and reported on progress made on the recommendations from 
the 2008 Performance Review of CCAMLR. 
6. In addition to key outcomes addressing Performance Review Recommendations (for 
instance Marine Protected Areas), the Commission agreed to a shorter eight day 
Commission meeting in 2012 and 2013 as a trial in the interests of improving the 
efficiency of CCAMLR. This will be reviewed following the 2013 meeting.  
7. Following a successful training event in 2010, the Commission agreed to a follow-up 
capacity building workshop in South Africa in 2012. The workshop will focus on 
assessing and developing the key port State controls that African States can implement to 
prevent IUU fishing activity and ensure that effective controls are in place at their 
maritime borders. The workshop will be delivered by Australia, UK, South Africa, the 
CCAMLR Secretariat, and the partnerships for African Fisheries’ Stop Illegal Fishing 
Programme. The Commission noted that this capacity building event was an important 
contribution to the prevention, deterrence and elimination of IUU fishing in the 
Convention Area.  
Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) 
8. The Commission adopted a general conservation measure establishing a framework for 
the adoption of CCAMLR MPAs. This framework outlines the common actions and 
                                        
 
 
 
requirements for the declaration, administration and management of CCAMLR MPAs, 
consistent with international law, including as reflected in the United Nations Convention 
on the Law of the Sea. The adoption of this conservation measure confirmed CCAMLR’s 
commitment to establish MPAs in the Convention Area. 
9. The Commission considered two scenarios for MPAs in the Ross Sea (proposed by USA 
and New Zealand). The Commission noted the advice of the Scientific Committee that the 
scenarios are based on the best scientific evidence available and that no further scientific 
analysis is needed by the Scientific Committee. The proponents undertook to further 
consult with Members during the intersessional period with the intention of bringing 
forward proposals for the formal establishment of an MPA to the 31st meeting of 
CCAMLR (CCAMLR-XXXI). 
10. Australia and France jointly proposed a representative system of MPAs in East Antarctica.  
The Commission noted the discussion of the Scientific Committee on the proposal and its 
advice that the proposal contained the best scientific evidence available. Australia and 
France expressed their intention to present a conservation measure for consideration at the 
CCAMLR-XXXI. 
11. The Commission noted a UK proposal concerning the protection of marine habitats that 
may be newly exposed as a consequence of ice-shelf collapse. The EU presented to the 
Commission a proposal for a conservation measure to provide protection for such areas, 
noting that this had been borne out of the recommendations of the Workshop on MPAs, 
and, in particular, focused on protection in the Antarctic Peninsula region, given the risk 
to ice shelves associated with the elevated rate of warming in this region.   
By-catch and incidental mortality  
12. The Commission encouraged all Members that are engaged in fisheries management 
bodies in areas adjacent to the Convention Area to implement best practice mitigation to 
reduce seabird by-catch. 
13. The Commission noted the Scientific Committee’s general advice on incidental mortality 
of seabirds and marine mammals. The Commission noted the progress made by France in 
recent years to reduce the incidental mortalities in their exclusive economic zones and that 
incidental mortalities elsewhere in the Convention Area were similar to the near-zero 
levels of recent years. 
14. The Commission endorsed the recommendation of the Scientific Committee in respect of 
the continued and enhanced engagement between the Secretariats of Agreement on the 
Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) and CCAMLR.  
Cooperation between CCAMLR and CCSBT 
15. The Commission noted that a draft Memorandum of Understanding in respect of general 
cooperation, had been forwarded by CCAMLR three years ago was still under 
consideration by CCSBT and requested the Executive Secretary to write to CCSBT to 
urge progress in this matter. CCAMLR looks forward to receiving an update at 
CCAMLR-XXXI.  
16. The Commission agreed that Australia would represent CCAMLR at the 19th Annual 
Meeting of the CCSBT in October 2012.  
17. CCSBT was invited to attend CCAMLR XXXI. 
                                        
 
 
 
Review of the Secretariat Strategic Plan 
18. In the 2010/11 intersessional period the Secretariat undertook a review of the 2002 
Strategic Plan and developed an associated Staffing and Salary Strategy. An Independent 
Review of the Secretariat’s Data Management Systems was also undertaken. The 
Commission will consider formal adoption of the Strategic Plan (2012-2014) at  
CCAMLR XXXI.  
Other issues   
19. Following a review of CCAMLR’s Financial Regulations, to ensure that they were current 
and appropriate to the operations and requirements of the Commission and current 
accounting standards, the Commission adopted amendments to the Financial Regulations 
and new investment principles to guide the Commission’s investment strategy.  
20. Other issues discussed at CCAMLR XXX included new and exploratory fisheries; data 
poor fisheries; krill fishery management; climate change; the development of standards for 
an accreditation scheme for participation in the CCAMLR Scheme of International 
Scientific Observation; and the development of a compliance and evaluation procedure.   
21. The Commission adopted a resolution which encourages Members and their flagged 
vessels to provide relevant vessel information to the appropriate Maritime Rescue 
Coordination Centre in advance of the vessels entering the Convention Area.  
Resolution 33/XXX (Provision of flag vessel information to Maritime Rescue 
Coordination Centres) was adopted. 
22. Recalling the sinking of the FV Insung No.1 in the Ross Sea in 2010, and Members’ 
concerns for the safety of fishing vessels, crew and scientific observers operating in the 
Southern Ocean, the Commission adopted a resolution to enhance the safety of fishing 
vessels in the Convention Area. Resolution 34/XXX (Enhancing the safety of fishing 
vessels in the CAMLR Convention Area) was adopted. 
23. The thirty–first annual meeting of CCAMLR will be held from 23 October to  
1 November 2012 in Hobart, Tasmania.

REPORT FROM THE CCSBT OBSERVER TO 
22nd Regular Meeting OF 
INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION 
OF ATLANTIC TUNAS (ICCAT) 
 (11 November - 19 November 2011, Istanbul, Turkey) 
CCSBT Observer (Japan) 
 
The forty-eight Contracting Parties to the International Commission for the Conservation of 
Atlantic Tunas were convened for the 22nd Regular Meeting of the Commission from the 11th 
to the 19th of November 2011 in Istanbul, Turkey. Thirty-nine Contracting Parties attended, 
joined by observers from two Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, Entities or Fishing Entities, 
three Non Contracting Parties, six inter-governmental organizations and twenty-two 
non-governmental organizations. 
 
The Commission reviewed the status of tuna stocks and by-caught shark species in the Atlantic 
Ocean and Mediterranean Sea based on the findings of the Standing Committee for Research 
and Statistics Scientific (SCRS) which met in Madrid in October 2011, as well as compliance 
with ICCAT conservation and management measures. Recommendations and Resolutions 
adopted in the meeting is at Attachment. 
 
No matter related to cooperation between ICCAT and CCSBT was discussed in the meeting. 
 
Conservation by species 
By the end of the meeting, the members of ICCAT has agreed and adopted new management 
measures for tropical tuna, North Atlantic and Mediterranean swordfish, North and South 
Atlantic albacore and billfish, as well as for the conservation of sharks that are taken in 
association with ICCAT fisheries. New improved measures for monitoring, control and 
surveillance were also adopted, together with measures to increase protection of seabirds, and 
structural improvements to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization. 
 
Tropical tuna 
For the first time since 1993 ICCAT adopted a management measure specifically aimed at the 
population of Atlantic yellowfin tuna, in conjunction with the continued management plan for 
bigeye tuna. A TAC of 85,000 t was set for bigeye tuna, with additional control measures 
comprising, inter alia a closed time/area season and a Regional Observer Programme. 
 
Swordfish 
The North Atlantic swordfish stock was successfully rebuilt in 2009 to levels above the target 
set by the Commission's management plan. This year a new multi-year conservation and 
                                        Attachment 16-4
management plan was agreed with the objective of achieving BMSY. The Commission adopted 
the measure consistent with the Precautionary Approach, which will ensure the long term 
sustainable exploitation of this fishery. 
Additional management measures on the Mediterranean swordfish fishery were taken in 2011 
including obligatory monitoring, control and surveillance measures. 
 
Albacore 
Agreement was reached among the active fishers of the south Atlantic albacore fishery, with a 
new sharing arrangement being adopted by consensus, with a reduction in TAC to align it with 
scientific advice. Given the healthy state of the northern albacore stock, the existing 
conservation measures were continued into 2013. 
 
Other species 
The Commission amended the current management plan for billfish to bring catchers into line 
with scientific advice and agreed to study additional measures in 2012. The protection of 
vulnerable shark species taken in association with ICCAT species continued to be a priority in 
2011 meeting, with new measures aimed at protecting the silky sharks being adopted, including 
the prohibition of taking on board, retaining, transhipping or landing the species. Measures to 
mitigate the impact of longline tuna fisheries in the South Atlantic on seabirds were also 
adopted. 
 
Strengthening Compliance 
The work of the Compliance Committee continued with a thorough review of compliance by 
each Contracting Party to identify failures to comply with ICCAT management measures such 
as a failure to report catch data or overharvesting of ICCAT species, and to review actions taken 
in relation to breaches of compliance detected in 2010. A general improvement in overall 
compliance was noted, with twelve Contracting Parties being in full compliance with all 
reporting requirements and deadlines. Additionally, the general improvement in compliance has 
led to the 15 of the 23 parties identified as having incurred a breach of ICCAT conservation and 
management measures in 2010 having the identification lifted in 2011. While some deficiencies 
still remain – in many cases due to the number and complexity of ICCAT reporting 
requirements rather than a lack of political will – all Parties undertook commitments to make 
further efforts to ensure full compliance in the future. To improve compliance with the bluefin 
tuna catch document scheme, Japan led the way in refining the scheme and proposing 
improvements, while the European Union chaired a technical group to determine the steps to be 
taken to establish an electronic Bluefin Catch Document scheme. The pilot study to be carried 
out in 2012 will test the eBCD system which will be set up at a cost of around 400,000 Euros. A 
resolution on the evaluation of systems for tracing products of other tuna species was also 
adopted. With regard to non-Contracting Parties, the Commission celebrated another success in 
the fight against IUU fishing, with sufficient information having been received from both 
Bolivia and Georgia to warrant the trade restrictive measure against these two countries to be 
lifted. The Commission took a major initiative in adopting penalties for those Contracting 
Parties which do not report data to ICCAT, by linking the right to fish with the obligation to 
report catch data. 
 
Into 2012 
Mr. Masanori Miyahara of Japan was elected as Chairman of the Commission for the 2012-13 
period. The next annual meeting of ICCAT will be held in Morocco between 12 November and 
18 November 2012.

Attachment 17 
 
Proposed Arrangement between 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
and 
The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
 
 
The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (hereafter CCSBT) 
and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
(hereafter CCAMLR); 
 
NOTING that the objective of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna (hereafter CSBT Convention) is to ensure, through appropriate 
management, the conservation and optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna; 
 
NOTING FURTHER that the objective of the Convention for the Conservation of 
Antarctic Marine Living Resources (hereafter CAMLR Convention) is the 
conservation of Antarctic marine living resources, which includes rational use; 
 
RECOGNISING that Article 12 of the CSBT Convention requires the CCSBT to 
collaborate with other inter-governmental organisations which have related objectives 
to, among other things, obtain the best available information including scientific 
information to further the attainment of the objective of the Convention and seek to 
avoid duplication with respect to the work of the other organisations.   
 
CONSIDERING that the Preamble to the CAMLR Convention recognises that it is 
desirable for CCAMLR to establish suitable machinery for recommending, 
promoting, deciding on and co-ordinating the measures and scientific studies needed 
to ensure the conservation of Antarctic marine living organisms; 
 
NOTING that provisions of the CAMLR Convention address the conservation of 
non-target, associated or dependent species which belong to the same ecosystem as 
the target species;  
 
NOTING FURTHER that the Preamble to the 2008 CCSBT Recommendation to 
Mitigate the Impact on Ecologically Related Species of Fishing for Southern Bluefin 
Tuna identifies that the CCSBT is determined to mitigate incidental harm to 
ecologically related species caused by fishing for southern bluefin tuna; 
 
DESIRING to put into place arrangements and procedures to promote cooperation in 
order to enhance the conservation and rational use of stocks and species which are 
within the competence and/or mutual interest of both organisations so as to avoid 
duplication or conflict between the activities of the two organisations; 
 
NOW THEREFORE the CCSBT and CCAMLR record the following arrangements: 
 
 
 
 
 
1. 
OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARRANGEMENT 
The objective of this Arrangement is to facilitate, where appropriate, cooperation 
between the CCSBT and CCAMLR (‘the Commissions’) with a view to enhancing 
the conservation and rational use of stocks and species which are of interest to both 
Commissions.  
 
2. 
AREAS OF COOPERATION 
The Commissions will establish and maintain consultation and cooperation in respect 
of matters of common interest to both organisations. In particular, the Commissions 
will:

conservation measures; 
(b) illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing vessels1; 
(c) catch, bycatch and vessel information and/or data2; 
(d) an annual CCSBT report to CCAMLR covering the global stock 
assessment of southern bluefin tuna for that year; and the latest southern 
bluefin tuna catch data classified by ocean, gear and catching country; 
and 
(e) an annual CCAMLR report to CCSBT detailing any catches (by flag and 
gear) of southern bluefin tuna from vessels fishing within the CAMLR 
Convention area. 
(iii) cooperate to harmonise approaches in areas of mutual interest and concern, 
most notably on bycatch of non-target, associated and dependent species 
(ecologically related species); 
(iv) where appropriate, collaborate on analyses and research efforts relating to 
species of mutual interest; 
(v) 
consider methods of recognising and cooperating with each other’s 
conservation and management measures; and
