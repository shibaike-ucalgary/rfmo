Opening of meeting 
1.1. Confirmation of Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended Commission of the 
Twenty-Seventh Meeting of the Commission 
1. 
Mr Ichiro Nomura (Japan) was confirmed as the Chair of the Extended 
Commission of the Twenty-Seventh meeting of the Commission for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT 27), and Ms Melissa Brown 
(Australia) was confirmed as the Vice Chair. 
2. 
The Chair welcomed Members and observers and opened the meeting. The 
Chair advised that the meeting this year is being held as a video conference 
(VC) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and that discussion for some agenda 
items had commenced in advance of the meeting by correspondence.  
3. 
The list of participants is provided at Attachment 1.

1.3.2. Observers 
8. 
Opening Statements by Observers are provided at Attachment 5. 
 
Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
9. 
The Report from the Secretariat was provided to the meeting as paper CCSBT-
EC/2010/04 (Rev.1) and was considered during the pre-meeting discussion 
process. There were no substantive questions on the report itself, although the 
 
resolution of the GST issue was noted together with the return to the budget of a 
significant amount. 
10. 
The meeting noted the activities of the Secretariat as reported. 
11. 
The Chair advised that Heads of Delegations have agreed to renew the 
appointment of the Scientific Committee (SC) and Extended Scientific 
Committee (ESC) Chair for another three year term and congratulated Dr Stokes 
for his reappointment. 
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
12. 
Members’ participants for the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC) 
and the Chair of the FAC were announced intersessionally in Circular 
#2020/077. The Chair thanked Mr Vallières for agreeing to Chair the FAC 
again. 
13. 
The Executive Secretary provided a brief presentation of the draft revised 
budget for 2020 (CCSBT-EC/2010/05), the proposed budget for 2021 and the 
indicative budget for 2022 - 2023 (CCSBT-EC/2010/06).   
14. 
For the revised 2020 budget, the Executive Secretariat noted that South Africa 
had not yet provided its contribution to the CCSBT for 2020 and that the large 
reductions in expenditure during 2020 were due to a combination of: 
• Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; 
• Restoring of certain Australian GST exemptions; 
• Reduced expenditure on trial eCDS development during 2020; and 
• Deferral of the maturity study to 2021. 
15. 
The Executive Secretary noted that the 2021 draft budget and 2022 - 2023 
indicative budget includes the funding required for the CCSBT’s usual business, 
including the Extended Scientific Committee’s three-year workplan. It also 
includes the cost for Japan’s proposal (CCSBT-ESC/2008/23) aimed at 
improving the existing methodology for monitoring of SBT product distribution 
in Japan. The paper also proposed that a contributions stabilisation fund be 
established to smooth out fluctuations in contributions that would otherwise 
occur over the next few years. 
16. 
Detailed consideration of the two budget papers was referred to the Finance and 
Administration Committee. 
17. 
The FAC was convened to consider: 
• The revised budget for 2020; 
• The proposed budget for 2021; and  
• The indicative budget for 2022 - 2023. 
 
3.1. Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
18. 
The Chair of the FAC presented the report of the FAC, which is provided at 
Attachment 6. It includes: 
 
• A revised budget for 2020; 
• A budget for 2021; and 
• Indicative budgets for 2022-2023. 
19. 
The Meeting thanked the FAC Chair and the FAC for its hard work. 
20. 
The EC adopted the report of the FAC, noting the revised 2020 budget at Annex 
A, approving the budget for 2021 at Annex B and noting the indicative budgets 
for 2022-2023 at Annex C. 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries and ERS Interactions 
21. 
The Chair noted the deliberations of the Compliance Committee (CC) on 
Members’ National Reports and invited Members to ask any questions 
regarding Members’ National Reports additional to those already raised at the 
Fifteenth Meeting of the Compliance Committee (CC 15).  
22. 
No additional questions were asked in relation to Members’ National Reports. 
 
4.1. Reports on Members’ projects 
4.1.1 Farm uncertainties 
23. 
Australia submitted paper CCSBT-EC/2010/22 on its progress toward 
implementation of stereo video (SV).  
24. 
Australia advised that it had undertaken considerable work towards 
implementation of SV and reiterated its commitment to implementing SV 
monitoring once a technology was found that was fully automated and cost 
effective. It noted that regulatory processes and legislation changes would take 
time and could delay the implementation of SV by 2-3 years. 
25. 
Australia will trial the cost effectiveness and accuracy of fully automated stereo 
video systems in situ in Australia’s tuna farms and will endeavour to start the 
trial in early 2021. It will test the market to see what systems are available and 
the likelihood that they will meet its preconditions for implementation. It is 
mindful of COVID-19 restrictions but wants to be able to consider all systems 
from all companies worldwide. Australia will meet the cost of the trial. If the 
market testing or trialled technologies do not satisfy its preconditions then it will 
continue to investigate alternative systems. 
26. 
The meeting noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had hampered Australia’s 
progress and prevented it from visiting Japan to see its new AI technology 
developed by NEC. It was hoped that COVID-19 would not prevent its planned 
trial of SV from being successful.    
27. 
Members noted that Australia’s intentions were good but that there had been no 
tangible progress toward the implementation of SV in its SBT farms. Members 
stated that they wanted to see more and faster progress by Australia, with 
tangible progress by next year and SV implementation by the next TAC block.  
 
28. 
Japan submitted paper CCSBT-EC/2010/18, titled “A pilot study on catch 
estimates with AI technology”, on an automated SV technology for measuring 
the lengths of tuna that has been developed by NEC. 
29. 
It was noted that: 
• AI measurement accuracy is good enough comparing to the manual 
measurement.  Japan believes that this is more than acceptable, given that AI 
excludes any arbitrary bias by human measurement; 
• The technology used in the trial is proprietary to NEC and has been 
operationalised in a commercial basis, such as for growth monitoring in 
aquaculture cages of bluefin tuna, yellowtail and salmons with its feature to 
automatically measure length and estimate weight of fish. A trial is underway 
in Japan to estimate the catch of Pacific Bluefin Tuna during the transfer to 
farming cages. Currently, the scope of trial includes the AI counting of the 
number of fish during the transfer; and 
• The effectiveness of the technology was improved with better video quality. 
30. 
Some Members noted that the technology was very promising. Members 
welcomed Australia’s commitment to trial it in its SBT farms in early 2021.   
 
4.1.2 Market uncertainties 
31. 
Japan presented paper CCSBT-EC/2010/19, which suggests actions to 
implement Japan’s market proposal in Appendix A of the paper, taking account 
of discussion at the 2020 ESC meeting. The objective of this proposal is to 
verify the catch of all Members (not only Japan) by primarily using information 
obtained from Japanese markets.  The details of the proposal are included in 
Appendix B of the paper, and relevant excerpts from ESC25’s report are 
provided in Appendix C.  Initial comments and questions on the paper were 
raised during the pre-meeting discussion. Japan explained that the proposed 
tasks included verification of all Members’ catch against both Japanese market 
data and SBT international trade and domestic distribution data by utilising 
Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) information, as well as verification of 
reported catches using tag data.  Japan commented that according to Attachment 
C of CCSBT-CC/2020/04, approximately 1,000 t of SBT is going to markets 
other than Japan.   
32. 
Japan recognised that reservations had previously been expressed by some 
Members regarding the proposal to draft a Resolution to seek the cooperation of 
Non-Cooperating Non-Members (NCNMs), and that it had suggested deferring 
discussions on this item until the next CC/EC meetings in 2021.  Japan noted 
that the proposed intersessional discussion of future improvement of tag 
specifications could potentially be considered at a Technical Compliance 
Working Group (TCWG) meeting with relevant technical experts present.    
33. 
The Chair summarised that pre-meeting discussions had confirmed that Toyosu 
is owned by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG).  In addition, Japan 
confirmed that Indonesia’s concerns about the use of COMTRADE data had 
already been addressed by CC15, which had agreed that Indonesia and the EU 
would provide its best available national annual trade data summaries to the 
Secretariat prior to CC16. In addition, Taiwan’s concerns about potential 2021 
 
costs for an external consultant (AU $50,000 consultancy fee plus 
approximately AU $6,000 for potential travel in year 1) had been answered by 
Japan in the pre-meeting discussion.  Japan added that it suggested that the 
proposed tag monitoring cost (AU $71,800) could be postponed for further 
discussion in EC/FAC in 2021 and so not included in the 2021 budget. 
34. 
Members appreciated the progress made in Japan’s proposal toward verification 
of all Members’ catch and it was agreed that the proposal’s budgetary 
implications should be considered by the 2020 Finance and Administration 
Committee. As a result, the suggested actions in Appendix A of CCSBT-
EC/2010/19 were accepted. 
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
35. 
The independent Chair of the CC, Mr Frank Meere, presented the report of 
CC15, outlining key points. The report is provided at Attachment 7. 
36. 
The CC Chair noted that South Africa had not attended the substantive part of 
CC15 (it only attended the report adoption) and had not responded to any pre-
meeting questions that had been directed to it.  South Africa apologised for its 
absence citing challenges due to resourcing during the COVID-19 pandemic.  It 
undertook to submit responses to the pre-meeting discussion documents 
immediately and did so prior to the close of the meeting. 
37. 
The CC Chair highlighted the key compliance issues discussed by CC15 which 
were: 
• Over-catches by both Australia and Indonesia, noting that Australia had 
already taken action to repay its 2018-19 over-catch of 40.291 t; 
• A very significant over-catch by Indonesia in both 2019 and 2020 (the over-
catch for 2019 and 2020 combined was 232.76 t for catch figures received up 
until August 2020); 
• CDS issues - significant issues remain with South Africa’s implementation of 
the CDS, and there are more minor ongoing issues for both Australia and 
Korea; and 
• Port inspection reports being submitted very late by two Members. 
38. 
The CC Chair referred to the CC15 meeting report including the report's 
workplan (paragraph 132) and summarised the recommendations (and notes) to 
the EC which are provided in paragraph 135 of the report, including the 
recommendation that a TCWG meeting be held prior to CC16. 
39. 
The CC Chair elaborated on the matter of Indonesia’s over-catch, summarising 
CC15’s key recommendations with regard to this item – firstly that: 
“…. considers Indonesia is non-compliant with respect to its Total Available 
Catch which it significantly over-caught in both 2019 and 2020 - there is a total 
over-catch of 232.76 t for 2019 and 2020 combined as at 10/10/2020.  
Indonesia has indicated that it does not intend to reduce its fishing capacity to 
address this over-catch and does not intend to use the payback mechanism 
outlined in the Corrective Actions Policy.  Indonesia advises that it is currently 
expecting to catch between 1,600 and 1,800 tonnes of SBT in 2020 which could 
 
potentially result in an over-catch of approximately 950 tonnes of SBT for 2019 
and 2020 combined.” 
40. 
Further that CC15 advised the EC to consider the following CC discussion: 
• “Indonesia has been non-compliant in relation to abiding by its allocation of 
the TAC in 2019 and 2020; 
• The EC should be flexible in deciding the timeframe for the over-catch 
payback (Indonesia has advised that it is willing to gradually pay back its 
over-catch following an increase in the global TAC in the future); 
• Indonesia’s current management measures need to be improved in respect to 
controlling its catch; and 
• Indonesia agreed to provide a plan to CCSBT 27 to ensure that its catch in 
2021 is within its allocation of the TAC”. 
41. 
CC15 discussed and agreed that remaining within a Member’s allocation of the 
SBT TAC is a key CCSBT obligation, especially in the context that the SBT 
stock is being rebuilt.  While Members were sympathetic to Indonesia's 
economic problems, CC15 was unable to resolve the issue of Indonesia’s 
payback of over-catch and application of the Corrective Actions Policy, and 
therefore this matter was referred for the EC’s consideration.  
42. 
The CC Chair thanked participants for their efforts in responding to questions in 
the pre-meeting discussion documents and for participating in a productive 
video conference meeting. 
43. 
The EC Chair advised that the EC endorsed all the CC recommendations and 
notes. The EC Chair also noted that Indonesia’s over-catch needed to be 
discussed further and the meeting had some preliminary discussions on this 
matter. 
44. 
While Members appreciated that Indonesia is a developing coastal State, it was 
agreed that not paying back its over-catch is not an option and not a precedent to 
be opened, especially given that the SBT stock needs rebuilding and that over-
catches may affect CCSBT’s Management Procedure (MP) and projections of 
the future stock status of SBT.  Members agreed that it was not appropriate for 
Indonesia to wait for a TAC increase to start paying back its over-catch, and 
noted that the maximum increase Indonesia could hope to gain from a TAC 
increase would be approximately 170 t if the current nominal percentages are 
applied to 3,000 t, a maximum TAC increase under the CTP. 
45. 
Several observers also stated that it would be inappropriate for Indonesia not to 
pay back the over-catch as it potentially undermines the basis for the 
Management Procedure.  
46. 
The EC requested that Indonesia prepare a payback plan for its consideration.  
The plan should set out how much over-catch Indonesia will pay back for each 
year over a specific time period.  
47. 
Indonesia agreed to payback its over-catch of 2019 in 2020 period. 
48. 
Indonesia prepared and submitted a payback plan for its over-catch in 2020 
which is provided at Attachment 8.  This payback plan is based on the 
assumption that Indonesia will catch no more than 1300 t of SBT during 2020 
and that its 2021 SBT catch will remain within its allocation, resulting in a total 
 
estimated over-catch of 459 t for the 2020 period.  Indonesia agreed to pay back 
91.8 t of this estimated 459 t over-catch each year from 2022 to 2026 inclusive. 
49. 
In addition to the payback plan, Indonesia submitted a second plan describing 
measures that will ensure that its 2021 catch of SBT remains within its 
allocation.  Indonesia committed to implement this plan which is provided at 
Attachment 9.  Members expressed some concerns that the plan does not 
contain specific controls and requested more concrete measures be added to 
control capacity.  
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
50. 
The independent Chair of the ESC, Dr Kevin Stokes, presented the report of the 
ESC for the Twenty Fifth meeting of the Scientific Committee (ESC 25), which 
is summarised in papers CCSBT-EC/2010/09 and CCSBT-EC/2010/17, and 
provided in full at Attachment 10. 
51. 
In response to questions from Members, the ESC Chair clarified that: 
• The possible unaccounted catch from non-Members, previously 306 t, no 
longer needs to be deducted from the global TAC since the new MP, the 
Cape Town Procedure (CTP), takes this into account within the MP itself, 
unlike the previous Bali Procedure; 
• The SBT stock is generally on course to rebuild but is slightly behind the 
target; 
• The CTP had not suggested a TAC increase because the main inputs to the 
MP, Gene Tagging (GT), Close Kin Mark Recapture (CKMR), and catch per 
unit effort (CPUE) were within the ranges defined for rebuilding and were 
not above the threshold values where the MP would suggest a TAC increase. 
The 2017 and 2018 GT estimates were half of the 2016 estimate but the 2016 
estimate was very high, CPUE was good but in the steady range, CKMR was 
slightly below the rebuild target. The ESC Chair pointed out that the rebuild 
target of the CTP was different to that of the Bali Procedure; and 
• The MP recommendation of no change to the TAC was not unexpected. MP 
projections in the past had shown a very large range of results with the most 
likely specific TAC recommendation being the current TAC, as shown in 
figure 23 of the report of ESC 25.  
52. 
New Zealand stated its concern that possible non-Member catch may now be 
conflated with Member UAM, when previously they were separate. It also 
stated that it was difficult to see from the ESC report the process that has been 
followed and how it relates to the amounts of non-Member catch that were 
considered plausible. 
53. 
Members asked how the over-catch by Indonesia in 2019 and 2020 would affect 
the MP and the rebuilding of the stock. The ESC Chair explained that the over-
catch in 2019 was already accounted for since the data for 2019 were used for 
the current stock assessment, but the assumptions were that the 2020 global 
catch would be equal to the global TAC. For the 2020 over-catch, he did not 
expect one year of over-catch to have a large impact but could not say how it 
 
would affect future TAC recommendations, and any further years of over-catch 
would be a different matter.  
54. 
Indonesia asked the ESC chair whether reducing the catch of juveniles by 
farming Members will improve the stock status and whether it is possible to run 
a simulation of this within the OM. It requested the ESC to study the impact of 
the juvenile catch of SBT. The ESC Chair’s response was: 
• Any reduction in fishing, juveniles or adults, will increase the rate of stock 
rebuilding. For juveniles, the effect would take some time since SBT are only 
fully mature around age 11, so it would take approximately 8 years for any 
effect on rebuilding to be seen and would take many cohorts to make a 
measurable difference; 
• Most fishing for SBT is on juveniles, with LL fishing also for juveniles from 
age 4 upwards and with the highest catch rates for fish yet to reach spawning 
age. Reduced fishing on juveniles, whether in purse seine or longline 
fisheries, could improve stock status as those fish age and mature. Depending 
on the age of juveniles not caught, the time for any impact on the spawning 
stock would vary. Reducing the catch of adult fish would have an immediate 
impact on Total Reproductive Output (TRO), especially older, more 
reproductively successful fish; 
• It is possible to run the simulation requested. When the OMs are run for 
stock assessment work or MP testing it is always necessary to tell the models 
how fishing will be distributed. In principle it is straightforward to look at 
changes in rebuild time under the current CTP under different fishing 
distribution scenarios. If, however, a request was made to re-tune the CTP to 
meet the 30% TRO by 2035 target under different fishing distributions, that 
would be a much bigger undertaking; and 
• If the ESC was to do a study on this then it would be important to have a 
clear set of well-specified scenarios to consider. For example, what specific 
components of the fishing on juveniles should be changed, what reductions 
in catch should be considered for each fishing component, is the interest in 
short or long-term distribution changes, what are the long-term objectives? 
Anything is possible but it needs to be clearly specified.  
55. 
The Chair noted that the EC was not in a position to give a specific request to 
the ESC on this matter, and that Indonesia’s scientists need to be more actively 
involved in the ESC forum to progress this. Indonesia advised that it had 
contributed actively to the ESC process however the ESC decided that input 
data from Indonesia is considered as a non-direct input for the Bali MP and 
Cape Town MP. Indonesia committed to provide more data in the future ESC 
Meeting. 
56. 
Some Members commented that they had expected the MP to recommend a 
TAC increase, due to positive information on the recovery of the stock in 
previous years, and they were disappointed that it had not. The ESC Chair noted 
that a short presentation at the EC may not be sufficient to explain complex 
issues and that Members national scientific advisors have a major role in the 
explanation of the details. The ESC Chair also pointed out that advice for the 
next quota block, 2024-2026, would be given in 2022, so there would be a one 
year advance warning. 
 
57. 
Japan further commented that while Japan felt that it should respect the outcome 
of the CTP, there is a gap between Japan’s expectation and the outcome, which 
Japan believes are due to insufficient communication between scientists and 
managers in the Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) process.  If the ESC 
stops making efforts to let managers understand the details of the MP, it would 
negate the MSE process itself since the involvement of managers in the process 
is a key feature of an MSE. In Japan’s view, the ESC should have provided EC 
last year with information on possible risks (e.g., under what circumstances the 
TAC may not be increased). Japan requested the ESC to consider how to 
improve communication with managers, taking into account the experiences and 
comments from Members for a better MSE process.  
58. 
The EC agreed that better communication between the ESC and EC was needed 
to help prevent misunderstanding in the future. The EC instructed the ESC to 
consider how this could be achieved. 
59. 
The EC endorsed the report of the ESC and the ESC’s work program with the 
exception of the e-tagging project proposal which Members did not support for 
budgetary implications at this time. 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
7.1. Attributable SBT Catch 
60. 
The Chair noted that full implementation of the agreed CCSBT definition of 
Attributable SBT Catch commenced during the 2018 season and opened the 
floor for discussion on how each Member has accounted for its SBT mortalities.  
61. 
Australia’s current national allocation of the global SBT TAC is 6,165 t and it 
currently sets aside 250 t for recreational catch.  Australia reported that it funded 
a recreational catch survey which was conducted by the University of Tasmania 
during December 2018 to November 2019. The survey was peer-reviewed by 
Mr. B. Hartill of NIWA, New Zealand.  It estimated a total recreational SBT 
harvest of 270 t during the 12 months of the survey.  Australia advised that in 
future, 5% (308 t) of its national allocation will be set aside for the recreational 
sector.  The amount set aside for Australia’s recreational sector (308 t) is 38 t 
greater than the total annual recreational catch estimated by the survey (270 t), 
therefore this 38 t can be considered as a buffer to allow for some growth and 
fluctuation in recreational catch and cover any recreational release/discard 
mortality that may occur1.  Australia further advised that the survival rate of any 
recreational releases is not included in the University of Tasmania report, but 
that scientific estimates suggest a maximum 16 t release mortality based on a 
previously published post-release mortality of estimate of 16.7%. However, 
Australian considers that due to better handling of released fish, a more likely 
post-release mortality estimate might be 5% which would equate to 4.8 tonnes.  
62. 
The European Union confirmed it has a small bycatch-only allocation for SBT 
and no recent reported catches or mortalities of SBT to report. It has longline 
                                                 
 
1 Noting that the actual estimated mortalities resulting from recreational releases reported in the study 
are well below 38 t. 
 
fleets in the S. Atlantic, S. Indian Ocean and Western and S. Central Pacific area 
that only intermittently fish in SBT distribution areas. The longline fleets target 
swordfish and sharks using fishing techniques to try to avoid SBT encounters. 
The EU reports by logbook but other sources of information are also utilised. 
Discards are not permitted.   
63. 
Indonesia advised that it has declared its over-catch and that all mortalities are 
recorded in its CDS.  
64. 
Japan advised that its Attributable Catch is described in its National Report to 
the CC/EC (page 3).  Retained commercial catch in 2019/20 was 5,950 t and 33 
t was allocated for discard mortalities, giving a total of 5,983 t of Attributable 
Catch.  Paragraph 48 of CC15’s report provides a description of how the 33 t is 
calculated using three body weight categories and an assumed post-release 
mortality rate. 
65. 
Korea advised that for 2019/20 its total Attributable Catch was 1238.3 t plus an 
additional 5 t set aside to account for its discard/release mortalities, i.e. a total of 
1,243.3t. Korea noted it was taking the same approach this season and next with 
regard to the 5 t set aside for discards/releases and that it was also examining if 
there could be additional or alternative methodologies to better estimate 
discards/releases and will report back to the EC and the next CC meeting in due 
course if it decides to apply any such methodologies in future.  
66. 
New Zealand noted that its national allocation is 1,088 t.  Of this 1,088 t it 
allows 20 t for recreational catch, 2 t for customary catch, and 20 t for 
release/discard mortalities, with the remainder allocated to commercial fishing.  
67. 
South Africa advised its legislation does not permit discards of tuna and tuna-
like species.  It further advised that recreational fishing occurs near areas where 
SBT are found but that no SBT have been recorded in recreational fishing 
competitions since the year 2000.  However, it has set aside 5 t to account for 
potential recreational catch mortality. 
68. 
Taiwan reported that for 2019/20 its national allocation of the global TAC was 
1,240.5 t and that with its carry-forward of 34.726 t, its total available catch for 
2019/20 was 1,275.226 t.  It sets aside 10 t to account for commercial discard 
mortalities. 
69. 
The EC noted this information on Attributable Catch. 
 
7.2. TAC Determination 
70. 
The Chair noted that the CCSBT adopted a new MP last year at CCSBT 26 to 
guide the setting of the global total allowable catch for 2021 and beyond. The 
MP has recommended a TAC of 17,647 tonnes per year for 2021 to 2023, which 
is the same as the TAC for 2018 to 2020. The ESC has recommended the 
adoption of this TAC 
71. 
The Chair further advised that last year’s annual meeting noted that “The 
decision on the TAC should also consider other information such as the 
sustainability of the SBT stock and fisheries as well as the papers and proposals 
that Australia will provide on Stereo Video and Japan will provide on markets.”, 
and that “New Zealand and the EU advised that at CCSBT 27, they would need 
 
to see that there had been real and measurable progress towards resolving 
current farm uncertainties and satisfactory progress on the market study 
proposal to investigate uncertainties before they could agree to any increased 
TAC that may be recommended by the MP”. 
72. 
One Member was keen to have a higher TAC. However, after getting an 
explanation by the ESC Chair that the stock is generally on course to rebuild but 
is slightly behind the target, it finally agreed with other Members on the 
recommended TAC based on the consideration of having faster recovery of the 
stock and the precautionary approach.  
73. 
The EC agreed to adopt the global SBT TAC of 17,647 tonnes per year from 
2021 to 2023 inclusive as calculated by the MP and recommended by the ESC. 
 
7.3. Research Mortality Allowance 
74. 
The Chair advised that the EC needs to make two decisions in relation to 
research mortality allowance (RMA): Firstly, the amount of RMA to be 
deducted from the TAC each year from 2021 to 2023; and Secondly, whether to 
approve RMA requested for research projects in 2021. 
75. 
The EC agreed to continue a 6 tonne fixed deduction from the TAC from 2021 
to 2023 for RMA. 
76. 
The EC also approved a total of 3 tonnes of RMA requested for the following 
research projects in 2021, which were endorsed by the ESC: 
• 2 t for the CCSBT Gene Tagging Project; 
• 0.1 t by Japan for a trolling survey of age-0 SBT in North West Australia; 
and 
• 0.9 t by Japan for a trolling survey of age-1 SBT in South West Australia. 
 
7.4. Allocation of TAC 
77. 
The Chair advised that Section 4 of the Secretariat’s paper CCSBT-EC/2010/10 
provides two options for allocation of the TAC. The Secretariat’s paper stated 
that the new MP incorporates plausible IUU catches and providing that 
unreported catch is no more than these amounts2 , the EC should no longer need 
to set aside 306 t of the TAC to account for IUU catch. 
78. 
The paper proposes two options for allocating each Members’ TAC for the next 
quota block taking into account that only the agreed 6 t of research mortality 
needs to be deducted from the TAC3: 
• Option 1: In accordance with paragraphs 2 and 7 of the Allocation 
Resolution, allocate 17,641 t (17,647 t minus 6 t) between the Members 
based on Members' nominal catch percentage levels, or 
                                                 
 
2 1,000 t of small SBT, 1,000 t of large SBT and 20% of the surface fishery. 
3 The 306 t no longer needs to be deducted from the TAC before allocation to Members. 
 
• Option 2: Leave Members' allocations unchanged in accordance with 
paragraph 3 of the Allocation Resolution, which states that "If there is no 
change to the TAC, each Member's allocation will remain unchanged".  
79. 
There was extensive discussion on allocation of the TAC with Australia, Japan, 
Korea, South Africa and Taiwan expressing their support for Option 1 above. 
80. 
One Member emphasised that only option 2 is consistent with paragraph 3 of 
the CCSBT's Resolution on the Allocation of the Global Total Allowable Catch. 
81. 
Indonesia acknowledged its current over-catch and explained that it does not 
believe its current SBT allocation is sufficient to meet its aspirations as a 
developing coastal State.  Therefore, Indonesia requested that Members 
consider accommodating its request for additional SBT quota.  It emphasised 
that SBT spawning grounds fall within its waters.  Indonesia asked Members to 
consider making the whole 306 t of quota previously set aside for IUU catch 
available to it for the next quota block. 
82. 
Indonesia advised that an additional allocation of 306 t should be fully utilised 
by Indonesia, and it considers that there has been an inequality in the allocation 
to Indonesia, as justified below: 
• Indonesian waters are an SBT spawning ground, but the allocation for 
Indonesia is less than developed coastal states like Australia and New 
Zealand, and even less compared with distant water fishing nations like 
Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. 
• On a historical catch basis, Taiwan and Korea never caught beyond 2,000 t, 
while Indonesia had a catch recorded in 1997 of 2,210 t and 2,504 tons in 
1999. 
• Even though the SBT spawns in Indonesian waters, when it reaches the 
juvenile phase, SBT migrates to Australian waters and is caught for farming 
by Australia. This leads to unfairness where the quota for Australia is much 
larger than other coastal states, including Indonesia, this is proven by the 
6,165 t allocation to Australia. 
83. 
Members were generally understanding Indonesia’s situation.  However, some 
Members indicated that they did not have any flexibility to consider alternative 
options to Options 1 and 2 at this time, but that they would be willing to discuss 
Indonesia's situation again in the future. 
84. 
To try to assist Indonesia, several additional options regarding the potential 
distribution of the 306 t were raised during further discussion.  These included: 
• While still retaining their current nominal percentage levels (for allocation), 
Members could consider an arrangement to voluntarily give Indonesia a 
greater share of the 306 t than calculated using Members' nominal 
percentages (refer to the table on page 4 of paper CCSBT-EC/2010/10); and    
• As an interim solution, Members could retain their current allocations 
unchanged for the next fishing season, but then re-visit options regarding if 
and how to distribute the 306 t at CCSBT 28. 
85. 
Another possibility discussed was that Members could independently enter into 
bilateral arrangements with Indonesia to temporarily transfer some additional 
quota to it for the upcoming fishing season(s). 
 
86. 
Indonesia proposed that CCSBT reform and reformulate its TAC distribution to 
be more fair, equitable, and participatory. Furthermore, Indonesia proposed that 
CCSBT also acknowledges the nature of respective fishing practices, i.e. small 
scale fisheries so that the distribution of TAC not only benefits big countries but 
also coastal developing countries. Indonesia also considers that the EC should 
evaluate the current TAC distribution, which is based heavily on historical data. 
87. 
Extensive discussions were held in order to find a solution that was acceptable 
to all Members at this meeting. Complicating factors included:  
• The other Members had received no warning prior to the CC and EC 
meetings that Indonesia was going to seek an additional allocation outside of 
that in the CCSBT’s Resolution on the Allocation of the Global Total 
Allowable Catch. Consequently, most Members did not have a mandate to 
discuss and agree allocation.  
• The recommended and adopted TAC for 2021-2023 is the same as that for 
2018-2020 (as opposed to an increase), which provided little opportunity for 
increased allocations.  
• Concern with increasing Indonesia’s allocation at a time when it had 
substantially over caught its allocation two-years in a row (2019 and 2020) 
and had not yet paid back that amount. 
88. 
It was decided that any increase for Indonesia at this meeting would come from 
the 306 t that had previously been set aside to account for IUU catch of non-
Members4. 
89. 
In consideration of COVID-19 impacts on Indonesia, the EC agreed that 80 t of 
the 306 t that was previously deducted from the TAC for unaccounted 
mortalities would be provided to Indonesia for 20215. This special temporary 
allowance may also be provided to Indonesia for 2022 and 2023, based on an 
annual review, if Indonesia complies with its payback plan starting from 2022 
and no further over-catch occurs each year. This is a temporary arrangement 
that does not affect the nominal catch level or nominal catch percentage levels 
within the Annex of the Resolution on the Allocation of the Global Total 
Allowable Catch. The remaining 226 t of the 306 t will be distributed to all 
Members in accordance with the Nominal Catch Percentage levels for the quota 
block from 2021 to 2023. Again, this distribution will not affect nominal catch 
levels or nominal catch percentage levels and is only for this quota block. 
90. 
In addition, Japan has voluntarily agreed to providing a transfer of 21 t to 
Indonesia and 27 t to South Africa each year for 2021 to 2023. Australia has 
also agreed to provide a voluntary transfer of 7 t to Indonesia each year for 2021 
to 2023. 
91. 
Column “3” of Table 1 provides the Effective Catch Limit for each Member in 
2021 taking the above figures (from paragraphs 89 and 90) into account. 
 
                                                 
 
4 There is no longer a requirement to set aside 306 t to account for IUU catch by non-Members (see paragraph 77). 
5 This arrangement does not set any precedent for future allocation decisions.

The EC accepted the pay back plan and management measures which Indonesia 
submitted (paragraphs 48 and 49) subject to the review to be conducted at CC16 
and CCSBT28. 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Ecologically Related Species (ERS) 
93. 
Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC, and at CC.  
94. 
The meeting noted continued high levels of seabird and shark bycatch and 
concerns about continuing seabird bycatch, despite adherence by some 
Members to agreed mitigation methods.  
95. 
The meeting further noted steps proposed by some Members to improve 
compliance with existing ERS bycatch mitigation measures. 
96. 
The meeting agreed to adopt the changes to the CCSBT’s ERS Resolution10 that 
were proposed in paper CCSBT-EC/2010/11 from the Secretariat. The revised 
ERS Resolution adopted by the EC is shown at Attachment 11.   
97. 
It was noted that the WCPFC Conservation and Management Measure 2019-04 
referred to in CCSBT’s updated ERS Resolution does not apply to Indonesia 
before 1 November 2021, and that this is stated at footnote 4 of that Measure. 
98. 
The EC agreed that when it considers the agenda for the 2022 Ecologically 
Related Species Working Group (ERSWG) meeting, it would discuss whether 
to include ERS issues raised in the pre-meeting documents prepared for the 
meetings of the CC and EC including the following topics that were suggested 
by NGOs: 
                                                 
 
6 Includes a deduction of 21 t for Japan’s voluntary transfer to Indonesia and a further 27 t for Japan’s voluntary 
transfer to South Africa. 
7 Includes a deduction of 7 t for Australia’s voluntary transfer to Indonesia. 
8 Includes voluntary transfers to Indonesia of 21 t from Japan, 7 t from Australia and the special temporary 
allowance of 80 t. 
9 Includes a voluntary transfer of 27 t to South Africa from Japan. 
10 Resolution to Align CCSBT’s Ecologically Related Species measures with those of other tuna RFMOs. 
 
• Consideration of the recommendations from the December 2019 meeting of 
the joint tuna RFMO by-catch working group meeting for any required action 
by the CCSBT; 
• Consideration of what implications there may be for interpreting catch of 
ERS species due to the CPUE alternative standardisation adopted at the ESC 
and what that means for ERS; and 
• Improvements to ERS reporting. 
99. 
Japan commented that its industry has not undertaken all stipulated seabird 
mitigation measures, but that there has been engagement with industry and 
strong instructions for industry to implement the measures. This will improve 
compliance, which is expected to reduce Japan’s seabird bycatch mortality. 
Japan further commented that suggestions from NGOs to deduct SBT allocation 
for non-compliance with mitigation measures could not be considered from just 
an ERS perspective, which will invite very complex discussion. 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Selection of the Panel for the Performance Review of the 
CCSBT 
100. CCSBT 26 agreed the Terms of Reference (ToR) for the performance review of 
the CCSBT that will be conducted in 2021. The two independent experts for the 
Performance Review and the IOTC expert were decided by the EC 
intersessionally as follows: 
• The Chair of the panel is Mr. William Gibbons-Fly (based in the USA); 
• The second independent expert is Dr. Fábio Hazin (based in Brazil); and 
• The expert from an IOTC Member country is Mr. Hussain Sinan (from the 
Maldives, but currently based in Canada). 
101. In accordance with the ToR, the Member experts are to be nominated and 
elected at CCSBT 27. The Chair advised that Heads of Delegations have 
nominated and agreed the following three CCSBT experts for the Panel: 
• Mr. Hong-Yen Huang (Taiwan) as an expert from a distant water far seas 
fishing Member; 
• Prof. Indra Jaya (Indonesia) as an expert from a coastal State developing 
Member; and 
• Mr. Dominic Vallières (New Zealand) as an expert from a developed coastal 
Member. 
102. The Chair congratulated these experts and thanked them in advance for their 
hard work in the performance review. The outcomes of the performance review 
will be reported to the next annual meeting of the EC. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
103. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in advance of 
the EC.  
 
104. The Secretariat submitted paper CCSBT-EC/2010/13 which summarised the 
Secretariat’s interactions with non-Members since CCSBT 26. China, Fiji, 
Mauritius, Namibia, Singapore and the USA were invited to attend this meeting 
and CC 15.  The EC agreed that the Secretariat should invite these non-
Members to CC 16 and CCSBT 28. 
105. Discussion also noted that: 
• A reminder should be sent to China with regard to the CCSBT’s query on 
implementation of China’s regulations concerning SBT and China’s 
monitoring of the compliance of its vessels. 
• For Namibia, reference could be made of its report to ICCAT that its longline 
vessels operating in the South Atlantic occasionally bycaught Atlantic 
bluefin tuna when targeting albacore. It was noted that the Chair of the 
ICCAT scientific committee pointed out that these fish were likely to be 
southern bluefin tuna. 
• Given the declining relative importance of Japan as the SBT market, more 
attention and focus should be given to other SBT markets under this agenda 
item. 
106. The Chair thanked the United States for its continued cooperation with the 
CCSBT’s Catch Documentation Scheme. 
107. Japan expressed its appreciation that the USA has been monitoring imports of 
SBT and hopes that the USA’s cooperation with the CCSBT’s CDS continues. 
It added that Members should be reconciling their records of SBT exports to the 
USA with USA import figures and that it would like the CCSBT to have a 
process in place for that. Japan also referred to CC15 information which 
suggests that the USA’s SBT import statistics may more accurately reflect direct 
SBT exports/imports but it may not fully reflect shipments where Members 
(re-)export SBT to the USA using REEFs, and that it would be useful to raise 
this issue with the USA 
108. Japan also advised that it will contact China to seek information regarding the 
implementation of China’s regulations concerning SBT and will provide the 
response to the Secretariat for circulation to Members. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Kobe Process 
109. The Secretariat submitted paper CCSBT-EC/2010/14 (Rev.1) for this agenda 
item, which outlined the lack of specific Kobe Process activity during 202011. 
Part of the limited Kobe Process activity was a consequence of the COVID-19 
pandemic.  
110. Due to the declining Kobe Process activity over the past few years, the EC 
agreed to remove the Kobe Process standing agenda item from meetings of the 
Extended Commission. Instead, an agenda item will be included for the Kobe 
Process when there are matters of substance to report. 
                                                 
 
11 Although there was a joint tuna RFMO by-catch working group meeting, focused on sharks, in December 2019. 
 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
12.1. Reports from other RFMO meetings of interest  
111. The Chair advised that CCSBT Members act as CCSBT observers at RFMO 
meetings of interest and these Members have provided reports back to the 
CCSBT on matters of relevance in order to improve coordination with other 
RFMOs. Discussion for this agenda item commenced by correspondence in 
advance of the EC meeting. 
112. The following reports were provided by Members as part of their Observer 
duties for the CCSBT. 
• Korea’s report (CCSBT-EC/2010/23) on the 16th Regular Session of the 
Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC);  
• New Zealand’s report (CCSBT-EC/2010/24) on the 38th Annual Meeting of 
the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
(CCAMLR);  
• Indonesia’s report (CCSBT-EC/2010/25) in relation to the Twenty Fourth 
session of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission; 
• Japan’s report (CCSBT-EC/2010/20) on the 26th Regular Meeting of the 
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). 
113. Taiwan’s report for the Commission meetings of the Inter-American Tropical 
Tuna Commission (IATTC) was not available as this meeting has been 
postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chair advised that Taiwan will 
observe the IATTC meeting if it is held and report back to the EC on relevant 
outcomes. 
114. It was agreed that the following Members would act as Observers to other 
RFMOs on behalf of CCSBT during 2020/21: 
• Korea to continue as Observer to WCPFC; 
• New Zealand to continue as an Observer to CCAMLR;  
• Indonesia to continue as an Observer to IOTC; 
• Japan to continue as an Observer to ICCAT; and 
• Taiwan to continue as an Observer to IATTC. 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Confidentiality of Data and Documents 
13.1.   Confidentiality of reports and documents from 2020 
115. This agenda item was considered during the pre-meeting discussion. 
116. The meeting agreed that all the reports of meetings and documents submitted to 
meetings under the jurisdiction of CCSBT 27 would be made publicly available 
with the following exceptions that were listed in the Secretariat’s paper CCSBT-
EC/2010/16 (Rev.1): 
 
• Attachment A of paper CCSBT-ESC/2008/04 (Rev.1) from the Secretariat 
titled “Secretariat Review of Catches”; 
• Paper CCSBT-ESC/2008/22 from Japan titled “Monitoring of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna trading in the Japanese domestic markets: 2020 update”; and  
• Paper CCSBT-EC/2010/18 from Japan titled “A pilot study on catch 
estimates with AI technology”. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Meetings for 2021 
117. It was agreed that the following meetings and dates would apply for 2021: 
• The 26th Extended Scientific Committee meeting, in Brisbane, Australia from 
30 August to 4 September 2021;  
• The 2nd Technical Compliance Working Group Meeting, in Fremantle, 
Australia on 6 October 2021; 
• The 16th Compliance Committee Meeting, in Fremantle, Australia from 7 to 
9 October 2021; and   
• The 28th Extended Commission Meeting, in Fremantle, Australia from 11 to 
14 October 2021. 
118. The Chair advised that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no guarantee 
that the CCSBT’s 2021 meetings will be able to proceed as physical meetings. 
In relation to the pandemic, it was generally agreed that: 
• The Secretariat would liaise with the host Member to monitor the likelihood 
of the physical meetings being able to proceed during 2021 and that if 
necessary, the Secretariat in conjunction with the host Member and relevant 
Chairs, develop contingency arrangements for holding virtual meetings in a 
similar manner as was conducted this year.  
• Members should reserve additional dates in 2021 around the ESC, CC and 
EC meetings in case virtual meetings are again required. These dates would 
be 6 & 7 September, 5, 10 & 15 October. 
• It is preferable to avoid scheduling meetings over the entire weekend, so the 
10 October contingency day would be avoided if possible. 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Election of the Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended 
Commission of the 28th Annual Meeting of the CCSBT 
119. The Chair advised that there were no nominations for the Chair and Vice-Chair 
of the Extended Commission, and that consequently, the Chair and Vice-Chair 
will be determined in accordance with past practice and the rotation of 
meetings. Therefore, Australia will be Chair of the Extended Commission and 
New Zealand will be Vice-Chair. 
120. The Chair requested that Australia and New Zealand provide their nominations 
for the Chair and Vice-Chair to the Secretariat as soon as possible.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Good morning, good day or good evening, depending on where you are.  
On behalf of the Australian delegation, I would like to thank Japan for hosting 
CCSBT27, which is being held by video conference this year.  
I understand this is also the first time the Extended Commission has not met in 
person, after what has been a difficult year for all due to COVID-19. I understand 
however that Compliance Committee was able to complete its work via video 
conference, and I am optimistic we can also make similar progress this week. In 
particular I understand Compliance Committee was able to agree the extraordinary 
circumstances guidelines after long and complex discussions, and I thank all Members 
for their flexibility and constructive approach to this important work. 
I want to acknowledge the Secretariat for the great work they do throughout the year, 
and in the lead up to these meetings. In particular, the contingency planning (with 
Japan) and video conference organisation has been excellent. I would also like to 
thank in advance our translators who have the difficult task of keeping up with 
complex discussions, but whom we rely on so heavily. 
This year the Commission is faced with the task of deciding on the Total Allowable 
Catch limits for the next quota block. I look forward to these discussions noting that 
despite positive news earlier this year regarding the SBT stock, we must remain 
cautious to ensure the stock is rebuilding. That said, this year’s stock assessment 
indicates significant continued rebuilding from around 5% at the start of the CCSBT. 
This must be one of the greatest successes in regional fisheries management globally. 
The ongoing recovery of the stock can, in large part, be credited on use of a science 
based management procedure for the fishery, and Members adherence to its outcomes. 
It is critical that we maintain that discipline going forward, to ensure continued 
recovery, and broader confidence in the management framework for the fishery. 
Australia will update the Commission on the considerable work we have done 
towards the implementation of stereo video and the results of our national recreational 
fishing survey, along with our planned recreational catch set aside. 
Australia appreciates the difficult position Indonesia is in with the pandemic and 
economic outlook. We are aware many other Members are facing similar issues, and 
we are keen to find a way to ensure the continued sustainable management of the 
fishery, while providing as much flexibility as possible in terms of management 
measures. 
Like everyone here, Australia is committed to working constructively with all 
members to achieve the best outcomes for CCSBT.  
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the European Union 
 
Mr. Chaiman, 
Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
The EU Delegation is very pleased to participate in the 2020 Annual Meeting of the 
Extended Commission of the CCSBT. First of all, I would like to thank the Chair and 
the CCSBT Secretariat for the quality of documents provided to all Delegations and 
also for the preparation of this virtual meeting, including the progress achieved in the 
pre-meeting exchanges. 
The COVID-19 pandemic initiated a very difficult and strange year for all of us. We 
trust that with the constant support of the Secretariat and the efforts made by 
Members and stakeholders fishing activities are globally on track and the SBT stock 
keeps rebuilding. We believe that we all should continue our efforts to improve the 
level of compliance, which is essential to ensure the sustainability of all CCSBT 
fishing activities. 
The European Union welcomes the work and recommendations of the Scientific 
Committee, which set the direction to be followed in terms of Conservation Measures. 
In this context, the EU supports the adoption of a new TAC in a fair and responsible 
manner at the level recommended by science, ensuring the rebuilding of the SBT 
stock consistently with the Management Procedure adopted last year. 
With regard to Ecological Related Species, as one of the co-proponents of the 
improvements of the ERS provisions adopted two years ago, the EU fully supports the 
implementation and updating of ERS mitigation and management measures.  
Looking at the remaining uncertainties in accounting mortalities in SBT farms as well 
as on the management of information related to SBT markets, we are very keen to 
follow the progress accomplished since the last plenary. In this context, the EU 
supports the implementation of stereo-video technology as the best available 
methodology for estimating the weight of SBT in farms and would like to push for 
more accuracy on the information concerning SBT markets.  
With regard to the conclusions of the Compliance Committee, the EU backs the 
adoption of its recommendations, also including COVID-19 related issues. Globally, 
the EU seeks convergence and complementarity with the situation of other tuna 
RFMOs.  
Let me also highlight that the EU will sponsor the selection of the best Members’ 
experts to the Performance Review panel.  
To conclude, I would like to underline our willingness to work constructively and co-
operatively with all Members to make this CCSBT session a success. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Honorable Chairperson, Distinguished Delegates, Observers, Ladies, and Gentlemen, 
The Taiwan Delegation is very pleased to be present at the 27th Annual Meeting of 
CCSBT. First of all, I would like to extend our appreciation to Mr. Kennedy, the 
Executive Secretary, and the Secretariat staff for your exceptional work of arranging 
all the virtual meetings and preparatory works throughout the year.  
This year has been a challenging one, the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected 
Taiwanese Southern Bluefin Tuna fisheries during 2020. Many management measures 
were forced to be conducted through alternative means, such as transhipment, port 
state measures, observer program, and so on. However, Taiwan, committed to the 
safety and welfare of all fisheries-related workers and compliance with relevant 
RFMO management measures, has taken proactive actions and implement appropriate 
measures to mitigate the impact of the extraordinary circumstances to the greatest 
extent possible. Hopefully, through global cooperation, we can overcome this crisis in 
solidarity. 
Concerning crucial issues of this meeting, the allocation of the total allowable catch 
(TAC) of Southern Bluefin Tuna after the adoption of the "Cape Town Procedure” 
remains to be our focus issue. Taiwan is glad to see the positive trend that the Total 
Reproductive Output has risen to 20% of its initial biomass in 2020, and the cautious 
recommendation made by the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) on the annual 
TAC for 2021 to 2023 through the new Management Procedure. As for the allocation 
of TAC, we should take the scenarios of unaccounted mortality into consideration and 
proceed with the best scientific evidence available that the ESC equipped us with. 
Based on good collaboration experience with every member in the past, Taiwan is 
confident that this Commission can decide on the optimal manner to effectively 
manage the Southern Bluefin tuna fishery under the premise of maintaining the trend 
of stock rebuilding. 
To conclude, I look forward to working with all members in the following days in this 
unprecedented format to achieve constructive outcomes. With the cooperation of 
every member, I believe that we can make further contributions to the sustainability 
and proper management of SBT fishery. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Honorable Chairman  
Executive Secretary of the Commission, Distinguished Delegates, Observers,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, I would like to thank the 
Secretariat for effective and efficient ways to facilitate the 27th Annual Meeting 
through the virtual meeting, despite many obstacles faced this year due to pandemic 
Covid19. I am also taking this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to the 
Chair of the Extended Commission, Mr. Ichiro Nomura, Executive Secretary, Mr. 
Robert Kennedy, and all Chairs of the Committees and Working Group as well as 
Secretariat Staffs for their work throughout the year, and for always doing excellent 
jobs in arranging all preparatory works to this meeting.  
To begin the Opening Statement, I would like to retake this opportunity to express our 
solidarity with Member States who are fighting COVID-19 and our sincere 
condolences for their loss. Hopefully, we could strive together to fight the disease in 
the spirit of good cooperation. In the middle of this unfortunate event, we shall endure 
and adapt. Thus, this meeting is held virtually with the protocols managed by the 
Secretariat and Chair. We hope that we could keep our spirit to have fruitful 
discussions in this meeting. 
Honorable Chairman and distinguished delegates, 
In principle, Indonesia strongly supports applying the corrective action policy to 
ensure the effective implementation of the SBT management on a catch quota basis. 
However, its application should objectively consider the specific circumstances of the 
Indonesian tuna fisheries and poses a unique geographical seascape, which has a 
significant difference to the remaining CCSBT members.  
At this juncture, we would like to share the complexity of the Indonesia tuna fisheries. 
Indonesia is a developing coastal state that is considered the largest in terms of 
number but the lowest in fishing productivity of tuna fishing fleets operating in the 
Indian ocean. This situation was caused mainly by a wide range of vessel sizes 
dominated by small-sized vessels with the least technologically advanced. Our fleets 
do not have the technology to identify fish schooling like any other developed state. 
Due to their technology limitation and therefore, they tend to fish for yellowfin tuna 
and bigeye tuna as target species due to their relative abundance population compare 
to SBT fish stock. That is why we consider that SBT catch as bycatch or un-intended 
catch.  
As we acknowledge, SBT migrates within the Indonesian fisheries management zones 
and goes even further within the first 12 nautical miles from the Indonesia coastline, 
where the SBT spawning area is located. The natural behavior of such SBT makes it 
almost impossible for artisanal and small-scale tuna fisheries who fished in their 
"backyard" waters to stop fishing tuna and tuna-like species.  
This condition should be considered a unique and special feature of Indonesia, which 
distinguishes Indonesia from other Parties to CCSBT, which also has a long history as 
SBT resource users. 
Honorable Chairman and distinguished delegates,  
Indonesia acknowledges that SBT catches on the harvesting year 2019 and 2020 
exceeds the TAC, and according to CCSBT resolution, Indonesia should payback in 
the following year. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Indonesia is facing an 
economic recession situation. Our growth rate had a sharp decline in two consecutive 
quarters of 2020. This situation forced Indonesia to adapt by relying on the primary 
economic sectors that have proven to survive during this economic recession due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic.  
The COVID-19 pandemic hits our economy very hard, shown by a negative GDP 
trend as much as minus 5.32% in the second quarter and projected minus 2.9% in the 
third quarter with an inflation rate around 1.42%. This situation leads to an increasing 
number of unemployment predicted to reach 11 million people by the end of 2020 and 
a decrease in the national consumption rate by minus 5.51%. This recession is 
assumed to continue for the following three years. 
To overcome the economic recession, Indonesia's Government has a national policy to 
increase the agriculture and fisheries sector's capacity and production. Both sectors 
are the surviving basic sectors to support the national economy, especially during this 
economic recession. Moreover, both sectors are labor-intensive and provide enormous 
job opportunities.  
We are willing to improve our management tools and welcome any assistance from 
other members and the Secretariat to ensure that Indonesia's management measures 
for SBT are in place to have better control of quota utilisation. As a member, 
Indonesia kindly asks the CCSBT and members to work together with Indonesia to 
seek a solution within the preference policy framework.  
However, we should consider that applying the corrective action policy in quota 
reduction due to the overcatches-quota should not have a negative social and 
economic implications for Indonesia, which is characterised by small scale fisheries 
and modest fishing technologies owned by each vessel. 
Reflecting on our current difficulty and willingness to keep good cooperation for 
sustainable SBT fisheries management, Indonesia would like to ask the Extended 
Commission and other members to consider this nature and provide flexibility to 
Indonesia to gradually pay back the over-catch following an increase in the global 
TAC in the future.  
Honorable Chairman and distinguished delegates,  
As we noted in the past few years, the Extended Scientific Committee continued to 
provide empirical evidence that the rebuilding stock of SBT remains gave us the 
positive signal with rebuilding spawning biomass, which will be achieved faster than 
expected using the Bali Management Procedure, as replaced by the Cape Town 
Management Procedure. Last year Extended Commission meeting considered that the 
Cape Town Management Procedure opened up an opportunity to increase the global 
TAC and indicated that the Extended Commission in 2020 would discuss the new 
global TAC for the next three-years quota block and distribution. However, the 25th 
Meeting of the Extended Scientific Committee recommends that there will be no 
additional TAC until 2023. Such a recommendation's inconsistency from the ESC 
gave a bad precedent for the SBT fisheries industry's sustainability due to creating 
uncertainty condition while doing the business and negatively impacting the economy, 
particularly for the investment work plan. 
Honorable Chairman and distinguished delegates,  
To conclude my remarks, I hope that all of the critical agendas to be deliberated this 
week on this commission meeting will provide the beneficial results that can 
contribute significantly to our joint efforts to meet the utmost CCSBT objectives. 
With that, I would like to underline our willingness to work constructively and 
cooperatively with other delegations for the success of this meeting.  
Thank you. I hope that all of us can stay safe and healthy during this pandemic.

Opening Statement by Japan 
 
On behalf of the Japanese Delegation, I would like to make an opening statement. 
First of all, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Executive Secretary, 
Mr. Kennedy and staffs of the CCSBT Secretariat for their tireless efforts for 
organising this meeting even under such an arduous situation as caused by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to the interpreters for their excellent job. We were 
originally planning to host this meeting in Sapporo, Hokkaido, where you would have 
enjoyed great food and nature.  It is quite unfortunate that we had to cancel it and 
missed a precious opportunity to meet in person once a year. I hope this virtual 
meeting will be fruitful. 
The most important issue at this meeting is the determination of a new TAC based on 
the new Management Procedure (MP) adopted by the Commission last year. The 
calculation of a TAC in accordance with the MP is one of the most unique features of 
the CCSBT, enabling it to make proper management decisions even under some 
uncertainties. I believe, however, that there is still a room for improvement in 
communication between scientists and managers/industry people in the process. We 
would like to discuss this point further during the meeting.  
Besides, even with the MP, it is important to minimise uncertainties relating to catch 
of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT), whether it is attributable to Members or non-
Members. To further strengthen the robustness of the MP, we once again request 
Australia to surely take positive actions toward implementation on stereo-video 
cameras, including on-site trial of the new technology provided by Japan. Also, 
following the last year’s discussion, Japan has presented a comprehensive proposal 
for the Commission-wide catch verification scheme taking into account SC discussion 
last September. As the relative importance of the Japanese market has been 
decreasing, more attention and focus should be given to other SBT markets, including 
those in non-Members.   
Finally, I would like to conclude my remarks by expressing my hope that we will be 
able to make an important step forward for the future development of the CCSBT and 
further re-building of SBT stock, through a constructive discussion among all 
participants during this four day meeting. 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Tena koutou katoa: Greetings one and all 
These are difficult times. Let me firstly convey our best wishes to all involved as our 
countries deal with this devilish pandemic. Our particular thanks to the staff of the 
Secretariat who have adapted to the changed circumstances in order to allow the work 
of the Commission to continue. 
This Commission meeting is not one in which to indulge long and arduous debate. 
None the less some key decisions need to be made and we need to check on progress 
on some key issues of import to the interests of members. 
New Zealand is pleased to hear that in the views of our scientists the SBT stock has 
continued to rebuild. Like others we are surprised that, despite the initial enthusiasm, 
the MP recommends no change in global TAC for the next quota block and we remain 
concerned that the continued uncertainty in catches is prejudicial to the interests of the 
membership in this regard.  
We look forward to hearing the views of the membership on these and other issues on 
our agenda particularly whether it is time for stronger measures to address over catch 
of national allocations. 
Attachment 4 – 7 
 
Opening Statement by Republic of Korea 
 
To begin with, the Republic of Korea would like to extend its sincere appreciation to 
the Executive Secretary and Secretariat staff for organising this virtual meeting in a 
timely and professional manner despite all the logistical constraints we have in this 
time of difficulty and uncertainty. Also, we are very glad and relieved to see the 
distinguished delegates from other Members who look well and healthy although it 
would have been even happier to see each other in person. We sincerely hope that our 
lives will go back to normal soon and that we will be able to have face-to-face 
meetings from next year. 
This delegation believes that CCSBT is unique in several aspects when compared to 
other RFMOs. One of the unique characteristics of CCSBT is that we have a relatively 
small number of Members and deal with single tuna species. In our view, the good 
thing about this is that it is likely that it often makes it easier for us to have focused 
discussions on smaller number of items. On the other hand, it also means that each 
Member’s share of the responsibility for conservation and management can be bigger 
as the performance of each one of us could have a huge impact on the status of 
southern bluefin tuna resource in its entirety and the Commission’s longstanding work 
to achieve the objective of the Convention which is to ensure the conservation and 
optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna.  
As such, with this thought in mind, Korea has continued to attach a great deal of 
importance to the implementation of CCSBT Resolutions and the full compliance by 
our fishermen since it joined CCSBT in 2001. We would like to take this opportunity 
to once again underline Korea’s strong commitment to its continued effort to 
contribute to the Commission’s work in terms of compliance as well as science.  
Last year, we adopted a new MP which we believe is a more advanced one but there 
remain some outstanding issues for us to resolve before we can set up the TAC in a 
more stable and less controversial manner using the new MP. We believe there has 
been a certain level of progress in these issues and hope we can resolve those issues 
reasonably soon. 
Having said that, we very much look forward to working with the Chairman, all 
Members, NGOs and the Secretariat this week, and firmly believe that the 
Commission will produce fruitful outcomes based on the spirit of mutual 
understanding and cooperation. 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by the United States of America 
 
The United States would like to begin by thanking the Secretariat for their excellent 
preparations for the Twenty Seventh Annual CCSBT Commission Meeting.  We are 
sorry to not have the opportunity to meet everyone in beautiful Sapporo, but must 
commend the Secretariat’s adapting the Commission and Extended Commission 
Meetings to a virtual format in these challenging times.   
The United States would also like to thank Members for the invitation to participate in 
the 2020 annual meeting.  The United States is committed to continuing our 
cooperation with the CCSBT, in particular with the CDS program through sharing of 
import data.  In previous years, we undertook a comprehensive review of trade data 
and have continued outreach efforts to SBT dealers.  The United States previously 
reported that U.S. importers are now required to submit all import data, including 
copies of CDS documents, through a single electronic interface, the U.S. International 
Trade Data System.  The United States is pleased that these efforts have demonstrated 
concrete results, as we have seen a clear improvement in implementation of U.S. 
domestic requirements among our dealers with respect to CCSBT’s CDS. We look 
forward to continuing to engage in this program, particularly as CCSBT seeks to 
develop an electronic CDS. 
The United States would like to take this opportunity to encourage Members to ensure 
appropriate monitoring, control, and surveillance of SBT fishing activities and remain 
vigilant during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, and in that regard, welcomes the 
discussions of the draft compliance policy guidelines in relation to exceptional 
circumstances. The United States congratulates the CCSBT for its continued efforts to 
recover SBT populations.  We encourage Members to continue this progress through 
application of the Management Procedure, ensuring the TAC is set in line with 
scientific advice, and in taking a precautionary approach to consideration of 
unaccounted for mortality.  The United States also calls on the CCSBT to take 
appropriate action to conserve ERS populations, including through the review of 
implementation of seabird bycatch mitigation measures.  
Thank you again to Members for the kind invitation to the United States to participate 
in the Annual Commission and Extended Commission Meetings.  We look forward to 
continuing efforts to enhance U.S. cooperation with the CCSBT into the future.

Opening Statement by  
The Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) 
 
Thank you chair, and distinguished delegates for the opportunity to participate in this 
virtual meeting, and the Secretariat for their efforts to facilitate and support the 
meeting and work of the Commission and its subsidiary groups.  
Through its 13 Parties, the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels 
(ACAP https://acap.aq/) strives to conserve albatrosses and petrels by coordinating 
international activities to mitigate threats to their populations. Bycatch in pelagic 
longline fisheries is one of the greatest threats to seabirds, particularly albatrosses and 
petrels.  At its last meeting in May 2019, ACAP's Advisory Committee declared that a 
conservation crisis continues to be faced by its 31 listed species, with thousands of 
albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters dying every year as a result of longline fishing 
operations. Despite extensive efforts by ACAP and other bodies that have been put 
into researching, recommending and supporting effective bycatch mitigation measures 
to address seabird bycatch in fisheries, in many instances these are not being 
implemented or are not being fully implemented.  Non-compliance in the proper use 
of seabird bycatch mitigation measures adopted by RFMOs responsible for high-seas 
tuna fisheries, including the CCSBT, was identified as a critical issue. Within 
jurisdictions where implementation of effective mitigation measures and appropriate 
enforcement has occurred, reductions in seabird bycatch have been demonstrated, 
sometimes dramatically so and without perceived detrimental consequences arising.  
The documents and information prepared and submitted for consideration by 
CCSBT's Compliance Committee and Extended Commission illustrate that bycatch of 
seabirds remains a critical issue in CCSBT fisheries, and in some cases appears to be 
increasing. ACAP is very concerned about the high levels of seabird bycatch recorded 
for some fleets. The report(s) also highlight low levels of compliance by some fleets 
in the required use of seabird bycatch mitigation measures. Such non-compliance will 
certainly contribute to, and drive, increased levels of seabird bycatch and needs 
urgently to be addressed. It appears that in some cases vessels with relatively high 
levels of compliance in respect of bycatch mitigation requirements continue to record 
high levels of seabird bycatch, which raises the question of whether these measures 
need to be strengthened, and if CCSBT should be playing a more active and leading 
role in efforts to strengthen the requirements to mitigate seabird bycatch. The reports 
also highlight that action is urgently needed to improve the overall levels of observer 
coverage of fishing effort and the representativeness of this coverage. ACAP is keen 
to work with CCSBT and its members to address these critical issues, and is strongly 
supportive of the proposal by BirdLife International and CCSBT members for 
enhancing education on and implementation of Ecologically Related Species seabird 
measures within CCSBT fisheries.  
Attachment 5 – 3 
 
Opening Statement by BirdLife International 
 
BirdLife International thanks the Extended Commission for the opportunity to 
participate as observers to this key meeting. We appreciate that 2020 has been a 
challenging year and we are grateful to the Secretariat for their work to make this 
year’s meeting possible.  
Firstly, BirdLife wishes to acknowledge some of the improvements in regards to 
seabirds over the last year, in particular the collaborative work between Members, the 
Secretariat and BirdLife on the joint proposals on seabirds, as well as the work by 
Japan to start corrective actions to address seabird related issues identified in previous 
compliance reports.  
However, despite seabird Conservation Management Measures (CMMs) being in 
place in the tuna RFMOs for almost a decade, seabird bycatch in CCSBT remains 
concerningly high. BirdLife would like to remind Members that 15 of the 22 albatross 
species remain threatened with extinction – and that longline fisheries in high risk 
areas, authorised by tuna RFMOs, continue to be the principal cause of this 
conservation crisis. Of all five tuna commissions CCSBT has the highest degree of 
overlap between its fisheries and albatrosses, such that it is impossible for CCSBT 
member states to escape responsibility for seabird deaths caused by the tuna 
longliners they authorise.  It’s now more than twenty years since CCAMLR members 
took effective steps to fix this same albatross bycatch problem in sub-Antarctic 
toothfish fisheries, and it is time that the tuna RFMOs, including CCSBT take further 
actions to solve this entirely avoidable issue. 
BirdLife are deeply concerned by the extremely high rates of seabird bycatch reported 
by the Members; Japan and New Zealand. We note that Japan reports a worryingly 
high proportion of sets conducted not in compliance with the required seabird 
mitigation measures.  BirdLife recognises that Japan has set up a corrective action 
plan, but we urge Japan, and other Members to monitor the effectiveness of the plan 
in reducing bycatch, and if necessary, to take further actions.   
Meanwhile, New Zealand have reported high compliance with seabird measures, yet 
still record unacceptably high seabird bycatch rates. This suggests that in areas of high 
seabird abundance the current measures are not enough to reduce bycatch levels to 
acceptable levels. Existing seabird bycatch mitigation measures of WCPFC, IOTC 
and ICCAT fall short of ACAP Best Practice advice, which requires the simultaneous 
use of three mitigation measures or hook shielding devices, and more effective line 
weighting specifications. We urge Members and the Secretariat to consider how more 
stringent measures can be adopted in areas where current practices are shown to not 
be effective, either through a CCSBT CMM for seabirds or by working with other 
RFMOs to strengthen requirements.   
BirdLife acknowledges that COVID-19 represents an unprecedented situation, but we 
emphasise the need for CCSBT members to continue to meet their obligations to 
implement CMMs and fulfil observer data requirements. With that in mind, BirdLife 
notes the opportunity afforded by Electronic Monitoring systems on vessels to provide 
higher and more representative coverage than current observer programmes. Indeed, 
some fleets were not meeting the minimum observer coverage requirements pre-
COVID19, and observer coverage will only decrease in the current climate.  
We would like to conclude by reminding member States that is their obligation under 
international legal frameworks to work to reduce the impact of longline fisheries on 
ERS. 
Attachment 5 – 4 
 
Opening Statement by Humane Society International 
 
Humane Society International (HSI) wishes to thank the Extended Commission for 
the opportunity to participate once again as an observer to this important decision-
making meeting. Despite the extraordinary circumstances leading us to meet remotely 
on this occasion, we look forward to further progress in securing the sustainability of 
the SBT fishery, both in terms of SBT and in terms of the impact that SBT fishing has 
on non-target species, seabirds in particular, which Members have agreed is the main 
incidental catch of concern. 
CCSBT fisheries have some of the highest albatross bycatch in the world. HSI has 
long advocated that CCSBT fulfil its duties under current international legal 
frameworks to remove the threat of extinction posed by the longline fishing it 
authorises.  
It is therefore welcome news that the 2021-2023 southern bluefin tuna TAC will not 
be increased because every two tonnes increase represents another albatross killed due 
to continuing mitigation measure compliance failings and the high albatross 
interaction levels of serious concern outlined in the CC15 Papers. 
Of all five tuna commissions CCSBT has the greatest overlap between its fisheries 
and albatrosses, yet currently, CCSBT only requires vessels to use bird scaring lines 
and to follow the seabird bycatch mitigation requirements of other tuna RFMOs. 
Improved mitigation measures are urgently required due to continued very high rates 
of albatross bycatch in some CCSBT longline fleets, reported low levels of 
compliance with mitigation measure use and the lack of ability of CCSBT to 
undertake compliance actions under the current system.  
HSI again asks that CCSBT adopt binding requirements for vessels to use effective 
seabird bycatch mitigation measures, as a condition of access to the SBT fishery, and 
that these requirements reflect best practice bycatch mitigation as recommended by 
the Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP). It should be 
noted that existing seabird bycatch mitigation measures of WCPFC, IOTC and 
ICCAT fall short of ACAP best practice advice, which includes more effective line 
weight specifications and the use of not two, but three measures in areas of highest 
albatross bycatch.   
In conclusion the EC is reminded that albatross populations are in serious decline and 
are declared to be facing a conservation crisis – and that longline fisheries in high risk 
areas, authorised by tuna RFMOs, continue to be the principal cause. HSI looks 
forward to seeing CCSBT Members work to strengthen required mitigation measures 
and prevent noncompliance.  
Thank you Chair and Members for your time.

Opening Statement by the Pew Charitable Trusts 
 
Thank you for the opportunity for The Pew Charitable Trusts to participate in 
CCSBT27 as an observer. 
2020 has been an unprecedented year that has affected the ability of RFMOs to 
conduct business as usual and we applaud the secretariat for maintaining a full agenda 
whilst running the meeting in a virtual format. 
Last year, a new Management Procedure (MP) was agreed, known as the Cape Town 
Procedure. Unlike in the Bali Procedure, the Cape Town Procedure did not set the 
total allowable catch (TAC) for the subsequent management period. Instead, CCSBT 
26 agreed that the 2021-23 TAC would be set this year based on the MP but also with 
consideration of “the sustainability of the SBT stock and fisheries as well as the 
papers and proposals that Australia will provide on SV [stereovideo] and Japan will 
provide on markets.” This agreement effectively decoupled the TAC from the MP, 
which is concerning as it opens the door to extended negotiations and untested 
scenarios, the avoidance of which are among the key benefits of an adopted MP.  The 
CCSBT MP is the benchmark for MP development in the world’s RFMOs, 
particularly the tuna RFMOs.  The decoupling of the TAC sets a dangerous precedent 
as it has the potential (if abused) to undermine the predictability, transparency, and 
stability that a rigorous MP can provide, arguably negating the entire philosophy 
behind the approach.  While we understand the concerns around farm and market 
data, we urge the Commission to re-incorporate the TAC back into the MP or at least 
restrict the ability for it to be undermined, by only allowing the TAC to be revised 
down from the MP recommendation. In other MP business rolled over from CCSBT 
26, we urge the Commission to adopt the “Metarules for the Cape Town Procedure” 
proposed by the ESC. 
Thank you members and we wish you a productive virtual meeting. 
Attachment 5 – 6 
 
Opening Statement by TRAFFIC 
 
Thank you Chair. 
TRAFFIC thanks the Commission for the opportunity to participate as an observer to 
meetings of the Extended Commission and its other subsidiary bodies. We thank the 
Secretariat for their work during this extraordinary year which has required them to 
organise this virtual meeting and we look forward to continuing to contribute to these 
important deliberations. We believe that we can learn from the experiences of 
successful virtual engagement necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and that 
CCSBT has an opportunity to expedite progress on critical issues through the use of 
inter-sessional virtual meetings, for example, of the ERSWG. 
TRAFFIC welcomes the continued signs the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) stock is 
showing of recovery, through positive reporting at ESC25 against the stock status 
indicators and trends towards rebuilding to the interim management objective of B30 
(30% of the initial Total Reproductive Output (TRO)) by 2035. We also note the 
recommendation for the TAC remaining the same for this next TAC period, but also 
calculations which consider the need for a TAC of no higher than this over the longer 
term if the 30% objective is to be met. Precaution remains a concern particularly as 
the stock is still at what is considered 69% of the MSY level and only at 20% of the 
TRO. 
TRAFFIC welcomed the adoption of the MP process at its eighteenth annual meeting 
in 2011 when the CCSBT agreed that an MP would be used to guide the setting of the 
SBT global total allowable catch and formulated a meta-rule process as the method 
guiding the implementation of the MP and for dealing with exceptional circumstances 
in SBT fisheries. We note with concern the decision taken at EC261 that the 
agreement on the TAC would from 2020 consider other matters beyond that 
recommended TAC by the MP. TRAFFIC has been participating in CCSBT since it 
came into force and prior to that at the Trilateral Agreement between Australia, New 
Zealand and Japan. We have witnessed firsthand the years of stalemate in progress 
against management due to disagreements over TAC setting in this consensus 
agreement. TRAFFIC is deeply concerned that this decision at EC26 will trigger a 
return to a climate of disagreement and disfunction. We urge the Member States to 
return to the process agreed at the 2011 meeting. 
TRAFFIC notes the continued action of the Commission to address unaccounted SBT 
mortality and that specifically in this regard China advised its fleet in 2019 to avoid 
catching and landing SBT, with prohibitions on SBT retention, area closures, 
transhipment and reporting requirements. The Commission should take steps to verify 
that this has occurred. The Commission should also look to ensure Australia and 
 
1 EC26 Meeting Report, Paragraph 87 and 88. NB: in paragraph 88 there is reference to an increase in 
TAC, but the most recent MP has not recommended an increase in TAC and TRAFFIC would not 
support an increase based on the importance of the 30% TRO target meeting its 2035 objective. 
Japan have clear timelines for the commitments they have made to address other 
issues around unaccounted mortalities. 
Regarding Ecologically Related Species (ERS), we are concerned that some Members 
are not meeting targets for observer coverage or not reporting their ERS catches. 
TRAFFIC is concerned by the reported level of shark catch by Members, while the 
estimates of catch, mortality and discard by some Members is extremely high for Blue 
Sharks. While we welcome the CCSBT Resolution on the use of ERS measures 
adopted by other RFMOs, we feel those measures are not specific enough to the 
sharks being caught by CCSBT Members and will not address or identify any issues 
of overfishing for the species until it is too late. Performance targets against ERS 
measures need to be set and members who do not meet such performance should not 
be attributed all their national allocation of the SBT TAC. ERS species are caught as a 
direct result of effort to catch SBT and CCSBT members catching excess numbers of 
ERS species should accordingly have their SBT allocation reduced. The evidence for 
this is particularly evident when considering the extremely high catch of sea birds by 
some members of CCSBT. 
In regard to the Resolution on Establishing a Program for Transhipment by Large-
Scale Fishing Vessels (revised at the Twenty-Fourth Annual Meeting: 12 October 
2017). Observed transhipments should be recording and reporting all species 
transhipped, which includes shark products. This information is important for 
verification of ERS catches that are being reported to the ERSWG, but also for the 
purposes of ensuring Members are meeting the requirements of shark CMMs in other 
RFMOs and permitting requirements for any CITES listed species. The latter is a 
specific requirement for observing in the Port States Measures Agreement. All this 
information should be reported and considered at the Compliance Committee and 
ERSWG.  
Finally we ask the Commission to consider the recommendations from the December 
2019 meeting of the joint tuna RFMO by-catch working group meeting be considered 
at the next ERSWG meeting for any required action within CCSBT. We also ask the 
next ERSWG be directed to consider the use of the full range of mitigation methods 
recommended by ACCAP to avoid seabird catch with a view to CCSBT adopting its 
own such management measures.

Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
Mr Dominic Vallières (New Zealand) agreed to chair the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC). The FAC was tasked with the following agenda:  
• Revision of the 2020 budget  
• Draft 2021 budget  
• Draft indicative budgets for 2022 and 2023 
• Consider the use of a Contribution Stabilisation Fund to avoid large yearly 
fluctuations in Member contributions. 
 
The revised budget for 2020 
The Executive Secretary gave a summary of the 2020 revised budget outlined in 
CCSBT-EC/2010/05. The revision incorporates actual income and expenditure 
together with forecast income and expenditure for the remainder of the year.  
Expenditures for 2020 are forecast to total $2,586,936, which is a 23.6% decrease on 
the amount approved for 2020. Many of the reduced expenditures were a direct result 
of the global pandemic and its impact on the operations of this Commission (e.g. the 
replacement of physical meetings with virtual forums). 
Income for 2020 was also revised downward by $209,451, which is a decrease of 
12.6% from that approved at the previous Commission meeting. This change was due 
to the lateness of the South African Member contribution. South Africa apologised for 
the lateness of the contribution, advised that its contribution payment had been 
processed and provided the Secretariat with evidence of its outward electronic 
transfer. This late contribution will now be reflected in the 2021 budget as a 
“contributions in arrears”. 
Importantly, Australia was able to amend its domestic regulations to allow a refund of 
$250,788 for Australian GST provided by the Australian Taxation Office for the 
period from June 2017 to December 2019. This influx enabled the Commission to 
reduce its previously planned withdrawals from savings. 
The Executive Secretary provided FAC members with additional details on individual 
items of the revised 2020 budget where significant changes had occurred from the 
initially planned amounts. 
Members of the FAC thanked the Secretariat for the revised budget and endorsed it. 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission note the revised budget for 
2020 at Annex A. 
 
Draft budget for 2021 
The FAC considered the proposed budgets outlined in CCSBT-EC/2010/06, which 
includes funding for the CCSBT’s usual business.  
The draft budget for 2021, presented in paper CCSBT-EC/2010/06,  
contained $283,400 more expenditure than the interim draft budget for 2021 that was 
provided in Circular #2020/072. This increased expenditure was related to the 
inclusion of Japan’s market analysis proposal and new items from the updated 
Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) workplan. 
Japan revised its proposal prior to the meeting to have the first year focused on the 
contracting of an independent expert to develop a revised methodology and suggested 
deferring further discussion on possible CCSBT expenditures relating to the tag 
management survey to EC/FAC in 2021, which reduced the immediate funding 
requirements for this work in 2021. 
In discussion with the Chair of the ESC, the FAC considered the proposed workplan 
from the ESC. The ESC Chair provided additional context to FAC members on the 
individual research items proposed and their relative importance in supporting some 
of this Commission’s key scientific processes. 
Reflecting the advice of the EC, the FAC agreed to fund all items within the ESC 
workplan with the exception of the electronic tagging survey. Funding of the 
electronic tagging survey would have required a substantial increase in Member 
contributions in the coming years and some members of the FAC expressed concerns 
that such increases may be difficult to secure given the economic uncertainties 
stemming from the global pandemic. 
In addition, the FAC recommends that future requests from the ESC for new research 
be accompanied by additional information to allow the FAC to have a better 
understanding of the relative importance and priority of the work in relation to other 
scientific expenses.  
 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission approve the 2021 General 
Budget as set out in Annex B to this document.  
 
Consideration of the use of a Contribution Stabilisation Fund 
The unique circumstances of the 2020 financial year, where expenses were less than 
those approved while income was greater than anticipated, presented an unusual 
challenge for the FAC in trying to maintain its longstanding goal of minimising 
fluctuations in Member contributions from year to year. 
In order to avoid large fluctuations in membership contributions in the coming years, 
the FAC has approved the use of a Contributions Stabilisation Fund. Without such a 
fund, Member contributions would have dropped in the upcoming year only to 
increase drastically in 2022.  
The Contributions Stabilisation Fund allows an even distribution of the savings made 
in 2020 over the coming years and will be discontinued once the funds within it have 
been fully utilised (currently budgeted for 2023). By using this approach, the FAC has 
been able to maintain Member contributions at their current level for both the 2021 
budget and the 2022 indicative budget. 
Indicative budgets for 2022 and 2023 
The FAC was also asked to consider indicative budgets for the two years beyond the 
upcoming budget. 
Most expenses within the indicative budgets represent ongoing commitments and did 
not require significant change from the FAC.  
Members of the FAC did note the general uncertainty related to this Commission’s 
ability to hold physical meetings and its potential impact on estimated costs. The FAC 
has currently budgeted future meetings under the assumption that physical meetings 
will become the norm once again but recognises that savings will occur should this 
Commission require virtual meetings. 
The FAC notes that although the 2024 budget was beyond the scope of this year’s 
review, the lack of increase in Member contributions in 2022 will likely lead to a 
more significant increase in Member contributions in 2024.  
 
The FAC recommends that the Extended Commission note the proposed changes to 
the indicative 2022 and 2023 budgets.

Indonesia's Plan of Gradually Pay Back of Over-catch 2020 
 
This paper responds to the Head of Delegation Meeting request for Indonesia to 
provide a figure of payback mechanism related to Indonesia's over-catch of 2019-
2020. Indonesia proposed to gradually pay back the over-catch 2020 starting in 2022 
for five years period. 
 
A. Background 
In recent years, the Indonesian Government conducted the data validation process in 
the first and second week of March in the following year. The landing for SBT caught 
in November to December will be around January to February. Therefore, the over-
catch will occur during those months, and it is reflected in the report of tagging on 
port. 
 
B. Overview of Indonesia's TAC and over-catch 2019 to 2020

The SBT Catch until 12 October 2020 was 1,078t. Indonesia's total SBT catch from 
October 2019 to December 2019 was 499t. Based on last year's historical data, it is 
estimated that Indonesia's SBT catch could reach 1,577t. However, Indonesia will 
maintain its catch up to 1,300t. Thus, it is estimated that the total over-catch for 2020 
around 459t.

Resolution to Align CCSBT’s Ecologically Related Species measures 
with those of other tuna RFMOs 
(Updated at the Twenty Seventh Annual Meeting – 12-16 October 2020) 
 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Recalling the decision made at the 5th Strategy and Fisheries Management Working 
Group Meeting to develop a binding Ecological Related Species (ERS) measure for 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) Members 
without duplicating the effort of other tuna RFMOs by creating a CCSBT Resolution 
that requires CCSBT Members to follow the ERS measures of other relevant tuna 
RFMOs, 
 
Noting the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation 
and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the 
need to cooperate and ensure consistency between conservation and management 
measures in the different tuna regional fisheries management organisations, 
 
Concerned that some seabird species, notably some albatrosses and petrels, are 
threatened with global extinction, 
 
Mindful that fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna can also cause incidental harm to other 
species such as sea turtles, sharks and cetaceans, 
 
Further recalling the requirement in Article 5(2) of the Convention for the 
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna that the Parties shall expeditiously provide to 
the CCSBT data on, inter alia, ecologically related species, 
 
Determined to mitigate incidental harm to ecologically related species caused by fishing 
for Southern Bluefin Tuna, 
 
Noting the importance of harmonising conservation and management measures with 
other organisations responsible for managing international fisheries, as agreed at the 
Kobe Meeting of Joint Tuna RFMOs on 26 January 2007, 
 
Reaffirming the recommendation at the seventh meeting of the Ecologically Related 
Species Working Group (ERSWG) held in Tokyo from 3 to 6 July 2007, that Members 
and Cooperating Non-Members will provide national reports on their interactions with 
ecologically related species in Southern Bluefin Tuna fisheries to the ERSWG, 
Agrees in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of Article 8, that: 
 
1. For the purposes of this CCSBT Resolution: 
a) the ‘Area of Competence of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission’ is that 
described in Article 2 of the Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian 
Ocean Tuna Commission;  
b) the ‘Convention Area of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 
Commission’ is that described in Article 3 of the Convention on the 
Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western 
and Central Pacific Ocean;  
c) the ‘Convention Area of the International Commission for the Conservation of 
Atlantic Tunas’ is that described in Article 1 of the International Convention 
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas;  
d) An Area defined in paragraphs a) – c) above is an “Area of Competence” and 
are collectively the “Areas of Competence”;  
e) ‘ERS Measures’ mean all measures relating to ecologically related species in 
force in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), the Western and Central 
Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the International Commission for the 
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), as adopted and amended from time 
to time, as contained in Annex I; 
f) Member or Cooperating Non-Member means a Member or Cooperating Non-
Member of the Extended Commission of the CCSBT. 
 
2. This Resolution shall apply to all vessels on the ‘CCSBT Record of fishing vessels 
authorised to fish for Southern Bluefin Tuna’ in the Areas of Competence. Each 
Member and Cooperating Non-Member shall ensure that such vessels flying its flag 
and fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area of Competence comply with all 
ERS Measures in force in that Area of Competence (whether or not the Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member is a member of the tuna RFMO in which the ERS 
Measures were adopted). 
 
3. When fishing outside Areas of Competence, Members and Cooperating Non-
Members shall use Tori lines in all long-line SBT fisheries below 30 degrees south. 
 
4. Where Areas of Competence overlap, Members and Cooperating Non-Members 
shall elect which applicable RFMO’s ERS Measures to apply.  
 
5. Each Member and Cooperating Non-Member shall ensure that effective action is 
taken in response to a vessel flying its flag that fails to comply with the obligations 
contained in the ERS Measures when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area 
of Competence. If a Member or Cooperating Non-Member of the Extended 
Commission undertakes fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in an Area of 
Competence of a Convention of which it is not a Member, that Member or 
Cooperating Non-Member shall report, if any, such actions relating to the relevant 
ERS Measures to the Compliance Committee of the CCSBT, unless the compliance 
of that Member or Cooperating Non-Member with such ERS measures is assessed 
in the appropriate body of that Convention.  
 
6. The CCSBT secretariat will annually update the list of ERS Measures contained in 
Annex I before the CCSBT Extended Commission Meeting according to any 
decisions taken on ecologically related species at the Annual Meetings of the IOTC, 
WCPFC, and ICCAT. 
 
7. Except in the case of WCPFC, Members and Cooperating Non-Members that have 
formally objected to an ERS Measure in the relevant tuna RFMO, and who, by 
reason of that formal objection and the operation of the tuna RFMO’s decision-
making rules, are not bound by that ERS Measure, are exempted from applying that 
ERS Measure when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in the applicable Area of 
Competence. In the case of WCPFC, Members and Cooperating Members that have 
sought a review of a decision on an ERS measure in accordance with Article 20, 
paragraph 6 of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly 
Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean are exempted from 
applying that ERS Measure when fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna in the 
applicable Area of Competence until the Measure becomes binding. 
 
8. The Secretariat shall annually present a report to the CCSBT Compliance 
Committee on the implementation of the ERS Measures, for the sole purpose of the 
provision of information for Members and Cooperating Non-Members.
