Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
9. 
The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/1510/04, which summarises the 
activities of the Secretariat since CCSBT 21. 
10. In particular, the Executive Secretary drew Members’ attention to two areas of the paper:   
• A set of proposed amendments to CCSBT’s Rules of Procedure (mostly to Rules 6 
and 10) provided at Attachment B of the paper; and  
• A draft on-line Compendium of CCSBT Measures, currently available on the private 
area of the CCSBT.  The Compendium provides Members with a list of all past and 
current CCSBT Measures, as well as a proposed classification system for easy 
reference. 
11. The meeting agreed to the Secretariat’s proposed revision of Rule 6 of the Rules of 
Procedure in relation to intersessional decision making.  Consideration of an amendment 
to Rule 10, to allow reports of subsidiary bodies to be released in a timely manner, was 
deferred for discussion until agenda item 17. 
12. The meeting agreed to extend the term of SC/ESC Chair’s appointment for one year 
while the EC works on common standards for the appointment and length of tenure for 
all Chairs of all subsidiary bodies of the CCSBT as part of its work on the revised 
strategic plan.  This work will be progressed intersessionally before CCSBT 23.     
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
13. The Executive Secretary provided an outline of financial matters that the EC would need 
to consider, including the revised budget for 2015 (CCSBT-EC/1510/05), and the 
proposed budget for 2016 and indicative budgets for 2017-2018 (CCSBT-EC/1510/06).   
14. The forecast expenditure for 2015 provides savings in five of the six cost centres of the 
budget, resulting in an overall decrease on the approved expenditure for 2015 of 8.7%. 
The most significant saving of $100,000 was due to the aerial survey not having been 
undertaken during 2015. 
15. The Executive Secretary noted that the 2016 draft budget and two versions of an 
indicative budget for 2017-2018 had been prepared, taking into account advice received 
from both the July 2015 meeting of the CCSBT’s Strategy and Fisheries Management 
Working Group (SFMWG) and the September 2015 meeting of the Extended Scientific 
Committee (ESC).  Detailed consideration of the two budget papers was referred to the 
Finance and Administration Committee (FAC). 
16. Dr. Kevin Sullivan was nominated as Chair of the FAC. 
17. The EU noted that now that it had become a full Member of the Extended Commission, 
its financial contribution would have an impact on CCSBT’s budget for future years.  
Accordingly, the EU requested that the Secretariat provide updated budget estimates for 
the FAC.  
18. The FAC was convened to consider: 
• The revised budget for 2015; 
• The proposed budget for 2016; and 
• The indicative budget for 2017-2018; 
 
 
3.1. Report from the Finance and Administration Committee 
19. The Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC) presented the report of 
the FAC, which is provided at Attachment 7. It includes a revised budget for 2015 and a 
recommended budget for 2016. 
20. After discussing the relative values and costs of the various elements of the Scientific 
Research Plan (SRP), there was agreement to fund Option A proposed by the ESC 
(CCSBT-EC/15/10/Rep02) on the condition that the assumptions used by the FAC are 
realised.  This includes an aerial survey during 2017, implementation of a long-term 
gene tagging programme and processing of the Close-Kin samples from 2016 onwards 
(to prevent an increase in backlog of samples). 
2015 
21. The meeting adopted the revised 2015 budget which is provided at Annex A of the 
FAC’s report. 
2016 
22. The FAC recommended reductions of expenditure in eight areas of the 2016 budget.  
Taking these into account, the proposed budget for 2016 does not result in an overall cost 
increase of more than 10% for any Member. 
23. The meeting adopted the 2016 budget which is provided at Annex B of the FAC’s report.  
2017 to 2018 
24. The FAC noted that the indicative budgets for 2017 to 2018 restrain the increase in 
Member contributions to below 10%.  This assumes that South Africa accedes to the EC 
in the first half of 2016, and includes the voluntary contributions offered by Australia 
and Indonesia, and the possible voluntary contribution of the EU. 
 
25. Following adoption of the 2015 and 2016 budgets, Australia commented that the 
CCSBT’s budget now provides guidance on the research priorities to the ESC. 
26. The meeting discussed which QAR should be conducted during 2016.  It was agreed that 
QARs of both Korea and New Zealand would be conducted during 2016.  The Executive 
Secretary was given the authority to adjust the proportion of withdrawals from the 
Secretariat’s savings in 2016 and 2017 to allow this to happen with no net impact on the 
budget for 2016 and 2017.  It was noted that this would result in no QAR for 2017, 
which had implications for continuation of the QAR program.  However, it was further 
noted that savings might be found for 2017 that would allow the QAR for Taiwan to be 
brought forward from 2018 to 2017.  A QAR of the EU would occur after this.      
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries and ERS Interactions 
27. In response to questions on national reports: 
• Australia confirmed that its recreationally caught SBT are prohibited from sale. 
• Japan explained that its higher number of interactions with seabirds in 2014 when 
compared with 2013 had occurred before the other tuna RFMOs had implemented 
 
their recently improved mitigation measures.  Japan also explained that bycatch levels 
varied greatly between vessels and that it will investigate the reason for this variation, 
and provide education and guidance to vessels recording higher interaction levels if 
required. Japan expected the number of seabirds caught as bycatch would decrease 
since the new mitigation measures had been implemented. 
 
4.1. Reports on Members’ projects 
28.  Australia reported verbally on the status of its stereo video research project which is 
currently being conducted by Professor Euan Harvey of Curtin University, Australia.  
29. The project ultimately aims to automate the measurement and recognition of fish using 
algorithms that analyse stereo-video imagery.  The project consists of three main 
objectives which are: 
• To develop the algorithms to be used; 
• Validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithms by comparing the mean lengths and 
weights derived semi-automatically to those obtained manually, and 
• To estimate the proportion of fish that can be measured. 
30. To date eight cage transfers totalling 23,000 SBT have been monitored, and it is 
expected that the project will be completed in early 2016, at which time a report will be 
provided to Members intersessionally. 
31. Japan queried what type of outcome Members might expect to see once this report has 
been completed. 
32. Australia advised that it expected to receive an estimate of how long it will take to make 
a reliable semi-automated count of SBT transferred to cages.  Currently it takes several 
days to estimate this manually from video tapes. The intent of the research project is to 
determine whether the transfer can be analysed in real-time, and if so, provide 
comparative cost estimates for each technique.  Government will then need to decide if 
the costs to industry are acceptable. 
33. Japan noted that in 2016, the ESC will formulate its advice on TAC determination for the 
2018-2020 quota block, and it would be preferable if the 20% uncertainty in relation to 
the surface fishery could be addressed before the ESC meets.  Some Members requested 
that Australia compare estimates obtained from the semi-automated method versus the 
manual 100-fish sampling method during its next surface fishery season in early 2016 in 
order to determine the accuracy of the manual method.  If there are any accuracy issues, 
then these should be reported to Members. 
34. Japan requested Australia tag fish at the time of the 100 fish sampling and then measure 
them at the time of grow-out as a simple and feasible measure for estimation of growth 
rate of farmed SBT.  
 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
35. The Chair of the Compliance Committee (CC), Mr Stan Crothers, presented the report of 
the Tenth Meeting of the Compliance Committee (CC 10), including its Workplan 
(paragraph 99 of the report), and thanked participants for a productive and cooperative 
meeting.   
 
36. The CC Chair drew attention to CC 10’s recommendations at paragraph 112 of its report. 
37. The EC adopted CC 10’s report and recommendations with the exception of the 
following items which it agreed to discuss further under agenda items 13 and 14 of this 
meeting: 
• That the Cooperating Non-Member status of South Africa, the Philippines and 
potentially the EU (if not confirmed as a Member of the EC) be continued; and 
• That Singapore and USA be invited to attend future Compliance Committee meetings. 
38. The meeting discussed the two Quality Assurance Reports (QARs) currently proposed to 
be conducted in 2016 for Korea and New Zealand.  Members queried whether cost 
savings could be made by conducting only one QAR (instead of two) in 2016.  The 
Executive Secretary advised that conducting only one QAR would save approximately 
$25,000. 
39. Members expressed support for holding a CDS workshop during 2016, and Australia 
offered to provide a venue in Canberra to assist in reducing costs. 
40. The meeting adopted the report of the Tenth Compliance Committee meeting (CC 10), 
including its Workplan and recommendations, which is provided at Attachment 8.  
41. Members thanked the outgoing Compliance Committee Chair, Mr. Stan Crothers, for his 
outstanding service and the positive compliance progress made by CCSBT during his 
term as Chair. The meeting then congratulated and welcomed Mr. Frank Meere as the 
incoming Chair of the Compliance Committee.  
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Report from the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group 
42. The Chair of the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group (SFMWG), Mr. 
Phillip Glyde, presented the report of the Fourth Meeting of the Strategy and Fisheries 
Management Working Group (SFMWG 4), which was held on 28-30 July 2015 in 
Canberra, Australia. The report of SFMWG 4 is at Attachment 9. The main items 
considered by SFMWG 4 were: 
• Funding arrangements for the CCSBT’s Scientific Research Program (SRP), 
particularly in relation to the scientific aerial survey;  
• Development of a revised CCSBT Strategic Plan; 
• Consideration of a Fisheries Management Plan; 
• Revised Minimum Performance Requirements for Ecologically Related Species; and 
• Nominations for the new Chair of the CCSBT Compliance Committee. 
43. The meeting adopted the SFMWG 4 report and noted the SFMWG’s recommendations. 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Report from the Ecologically Related Species Working Group  
44. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/1510/10, which summarised the 
report of the Eleventh Meeting of the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
(ERSWG 11), held from 3-6 March in Tokyo, Japan. This paper includes proposed 
 
revised Scientific Observer Program Standards (SOPS) at Annex B, and modified 
SMMTG1 Recommendations Agreed by ERSWG 11 at Annex C. 
45. ERSWG 11 made five recommendations for consideration by the EC, including that the 
finalised draft revised CCSBT Scientific Observer Program Standard (SOPS) be 
adopted, as well as endorsing and strongly supporting a proposed Memorandum of 
Understanding (MoU) between CCSBT and ACAP2. 
46. The meeting adopted the ERSWG 11 report, including the revised SOPS and modified 
SMMTG recommendations, noting that the MoU between CCSBT and ACAP will be 
discussed at agenda item 16.2.  The report of ERSWG 11 is at Attachment 10, and the 
report of SMMTG is at Attachment 11.  
47. Some Members noted that the ERSWG’s reiteration of their advices that urgent 
measures were needed to address seabird bycatch. 
48. Some Members emphasised that the coordination amongst tuna RFMOs is needed and is 
important in the implementation of mitigation measures. 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
49. The Chair of the ESC presented the report of the ESC meeting which is summarised in 
papers CCSBT-EC/1510/11 and CCSBT-EC/1510/21. The report of SC 20 is at 
Attachment 12.    
50. Members asked the ESC Chair a number of questions on the nature of the advice from 
ESC with respect to future recruitment monitoring, the gene tagging project, 
unaccounted mortalities, Scientific Research Programme (SRP) options, and the 
development of a new Management Procedure (MP). In response to these questions, the 
ESC Chair and ESC participants that were present advised that: 
•  The ESC advice is that gene tagging would be the best alternative to the aerial survey 
for the MP both in terms of science and cost-effectiveness; 
• Gene tagging recruitment estimates should initially ideally be provided annually, but 
once established it might be possible to provide them every second year instead. It 
may also be technically feasible to modify the MP to operate with aerial survey 
indices conducted only every second year, but this option would probably not be 
possible for logistical reasons, i.e. the lack of availability of spotters; 
• The ESC had an extensive discussion of potential exceptional circumstances under the 
MP's meta-rule process. The ESC noted the combination of individual issues (UAM, 
over-catch, potential loss of recruitment monitoring) represent a serious concern in 
terms of potential risks to the stock and rebuilding performance of the MP. The ESC 
reiterated its previous advice on the priority of the completion of the EC's work 
program for UAM; 
• In the 2014 ESC consideration of the impacts of unaccounted mortalities (UAM) the 
“added catch scenario” included the assumption of an additional 1000t of small fish 
and 1000t of large fish derived from the limited information available on the potential 
sources of UAM identity (as described in Table 2 of Attachment 8 and paragraph 28 
of the 2014 ESC report). The potential sources included the reported over catch of 
1 SMMTG: CCSBT’s “Effectiveness of Seabird Mitigation Measures Technical Group” 
2 Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels. 
 
                                                           
Indonesia (large fish), recreational catch and discards (small fish). This scenario also 
assumed continuation of the 20% over catch scenario for the surface fishery; 
• Recreational catches are not considered to be unaccounted mortalities if allowances 
are made for those catches within Members’ TACs; 
• Non-Member catch estimates of SBT were derived from WCPFC and IOTC Member 
fishing effort data, and include data from all Members of those RFMOs that were not 
Members of the CCSBT, in areas and seasons where SBT are likely to be caught.  
• The current approach to the SRP of continuing the aerial survey until gene tagging is 
established is the ESC’s preferred approach, but three lower cost options (A, B, and 
C) were presented in response to the SFMWG request; and 
• The ESC considers that it will be possible to develop a new MP by 2019 in time for 
the setting of the 2021-23 TAC, and noted the costs involved. 
51. The EC adopted the report of ESC 20 and noted its recommendations.  
 
8.1. Consideration of the ESC’s advice in response to requests from the SFMWG 
52. The SFMWG 4 requested ESC’s advice on following items: 
• The ESC’s relative research priorities for 2016 to 2018 inclusive, noting that the 
research budget is limited; 
• The costs and benefits of continuing with the current MP including conducting the 
aerial survey from 2017 to 2019; and  
• Any preliminary consideration of alternatives to the current MP approach including 
an indication of their relative costs and benefits if possible. 
53. The ESC Chair presented responses to each of the above items (para. 181 of ESC report) 
and extensive discussion followed.  A number of issues were raised including that: 
• There is no recruitment monitoring index available for 2015,  
• The ESC’s preferred option was to continue the aerial survey as long as possible 
through the transition period to a new MP (up to 2019);  
• Recruitment indices obtained from gene tagging could not be included in the MP 
immediately (instead of aerial survey data), and there would need to be a transitional 
period as CCSBT moved from the existing MP to a new MP; and 
• The analysis of Indonesian otoliths is an important indicator of the size of the 
spawning stock. 
54. ESC participants noted that: 
• Conducting the aerial survey in 2017 will provide a recruitment index and one of the 
key data inputs to the next full stock assessment, scheduled for 2017. The full stock 
assessment is important for judging progress against the EC's rebuilding target. 
Conducting the 2017 aerial survey will also enable the current MP to continue to be 
used, if needed in case of delays in developing the gene tagging approach or 
developing a new MP. 
• If the AS is not conducted in 2017 it is very unlikely that the AS will be able to be 
recommenced in 2018 (if needed) due to logistic issues. 
• Noted that the ESC provided advice on the risks and implications if the aerial survey 
was discontinued after 2016. This would require a new MP to be developed and the 
 
EC would be without a tested and agreed rebuilding plan. The ESC noted the 
continuity of the MP (including ongoing recruitment monitoring) is important as it 
contributes to performance in the feedback mechanism in the MP to correct future 
TACs. If there is no AS beyond 2016 and no MP in place, this will need to be 
considered as part of the annual meta-rule process. This situation is substantially 
different to the situation that occurred in 2015, where the 2015 AS did not occur but 
there was a commitment to the 2016 AS and current MP. 
55. There was general consensus that Members’ priority is to maintain a robust science-
based MP, as well as to move towards a more cost-effective MP with potentially fewer 
logistical risks.  Members agreed that this could best be achieved by accelerating work 
on gene tagging so that gene tagging data can be used as a recruitment index for input 
into a new MP.  The key issue would then be to identify the most cost-effective way of 
transitioning between the existing MP and a new MP using these gene tagging data as an 
index of recruitment rather than the aerial survey data. 
56. The ESC Chair noted that Close-Kin (CK) analysis is a powerful technique that can be 
used to provide absolute estimates of spawning biomass for input into stock assessments, 
and that there are three different research funding options available for Members to 
consider the costs and benefits of each one.  These are: 
• To continue collecting annual CK samples and genotype them as they are collected, as 
well as commencing genotyping the current backlog of stored samples (most 
expensive); or 
• To continue collecting annual CK samples and genotype these as they are collected, 
but not genotype the existing backlog of stored samples (medium cost), or 
• To continue collecting annual CK samples, but not genotype them as they are 
collected, nor genotype the current backlog of stored samples - the current situation 
(least expensive). 
57. There was extensive discussion with regard to the cost of undertaking various research 
options to provide data inputs into the existing/a future MP, and some items were 
referred to the FAC for further consideration. New Zealand noted that it is important to 
continue close-kin work as a valuable contribution to stock assessment given the current 
status of the SBT stock.   
58. Australia noted that the EC needed to ensure there was a robust science-based MP to 
guide TAC setting and that within the current budget constraints there was a risk that the 
EC could not guarantee the operation of the MP underpinning our rebuilding strategy. In 
contemplating setting the TAC for the next quota block, 2018-20, there is a need for 
confidence that the EC has an MP to guide this. There is concern that if there is no MP 
and gene-tagging does not deliver as anticipated that there would not be recruitment 
monitoring to enable feedback within the next quota block. Recalling the ESC advice 
that their preference was to continue to run the current MP, based on the Aerial survey, 
while developing the gene-tagging approach and a new MP. If there was no MP in place 
there would need to be a more precautionary approach to TACs and reduced certainty for 
industry and the rebuilding strategy. Also noting that the EC has made substantial 
investment in developing the current MP, as has Australia. 
59. In order to assist with budgetary constraints, especially the projected greater than 10% 
budget increase in 2017, several Members offered to make voluntary contributions to the 
budget: 
 
• Noting CSIRO's willingness to continue to make substantial contributions to the 
research program, Australia advised that it was willing to make a one time, voluntary 
contribution to the gene-tagging pilot research, for the 2017 budget. This is provided 
on the assumption that the 2017 aerial survey is funded by the EC and the principle 
that the ongoing costs of implementing the EC's agreed MP are met by the EC; 
• The EU confirmed that it is exploring making a one-off voluntary contribution to help 
fund both the gene tagging and Close-Kin research projects in 2017, as well as 
potentially  contributing up to 80% of the costs of the CCSBT meetings it is 
scheduled to host in 2018; and 
• Indonesia will contribute the cost of venue hire, catering and equipment when it hosts 
CCSBT 24 in Bali in 2017; 
60.  The meeting thanked Australia, the EU and Indonesia, and given their voluntary 
contribution offers, agreed to support carrying out the aerial survey in both 2016 and 
2017, the fast tracking the gene tagging, with the pilot study commencing in 2016 
(following ESC’s Option A), and the medium cost Close-Kin option, i.e. to continue 
collecting annual CK samples and genotype these as they are collected, but not genotype 
the existing backlog of stored samples. 
61. It was noted that the aerial survey for 2017 will need to be contracted around July 2016 
and it was agreed that the Secretariat would seek an intersessional decision to approve 
funding for the 2017 aerial survey in June 2016. 
62. It was noted that the data and results which are obtained from these research projects 
should be shared by all Members because CCSBT budget is allocated to these research 
projects. 
63. The meeting agreed to support option A (Attachment 7). 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
9.1. Attributable SBT Catch 
64. The Chair commented that Members were requested to report on the following aspects 
related to their Attributable SBT Catch3, in their annual reports to CCSBT 22; 
• Individual Member research conducted on applicable sources of mortality; 
• Members setting of allowances to commence for 2016-17 quota years for all sources 
of attributable mortality based on best estimates. 
65. The EC agreed that this is a very important issue, and that progress is critical in order to 
reduce unaccounted mortalities and have confidence in the MP’s TAC recommendations 
for the next quota block.  It was noted that the rebuilding rate achieved by MP 
recommended TACs will be below the target rebuilding rate if Members do not fully 
3 “A Member or CNM’s attributable catch against its national allocation is the total Southern Bluefin Tuna 
mortality resulting from fishing activities within its jurisdiction or control  including, inter alia, mortality 
resulting from: 
• 
commercial fishing operations whether primarily targeting SBT or not; 
• 
releases and/or discards; 
• 
recreational fishing; 
• 
customary and/or traditional fishing; and 
• 
artisanal fishing.” 
 
                                                           
account for their Attributable SBT Catch.  This will have implications for the ability of 
the EC to adopt TAC recommendations from the MP. 
66. It was noted that some Members are making good progress towards accounting for their 
attributable catch, but that progress is not as good as expected for some other Members.  
67. Japan advised that it will be capturing the best available information for its releases and 
discards and that it is trying to incorporate that into its allocation from next year. 
68. Australia advised that: 
• Current management requirements in the longline fishery are that discards can only be 
released if they are live and vigorous. With the implementation of e-monitoring, 
Australia is reviewing e-monitoring footage , and comparing this with log-book 
records to verify discard rates; 
• The research on a methodology for estimating the national recreational catch of SBT 
is almost complete, with the report expected to be released before the end of 2015. 
This report will be circulated to Members. The survey methodology required for a 
reliable estimate is likely to be expensive and implementation will require 
engagement with the relevant states; and 
• It intended to begin to make an allowance for attributable catch from 2018. 
69. The EC encouraged all Members to accelerate their implementation of action points 
described in the CCSBT 21 report. 
 
9.2. TAC Determination 
70. The Chair advised the meeting that the ESC has recommended there is no need to revise 
the EC’s 2013 decision regarding the TACs for 2016 to 2017. 
71. The EC confirmed the TAC for 2016 will be 14,647 tonnes and the recommended TAC 
for 2017 remains at 14,647 tonnes. 
72. The meeting considered the process for taking account of non-Member catches for the 
2018 to 2020 TAC block.  It was agreed there were two general approaches that could be 
used to take account of non-Member catches: 
• The first approach (the “Direct approach”) is to estimate the non-Member catch and 
then set aside an allowance to take account of non-Member catch before allocating the 
remainder of the global TAC to Members and CNMs. 
• The second approach (the “MP approach”) is to re-tune the MP to different scenarios 
that cover the plausible scenarios of catches from non-Members and have the MP 
recommend a TAC that takes into account the uncertainties in the non-Member catch. 
73. It was agreed that the MP approach was not feasible for the 2018-2020 quota block 
because the MP needs to be run in 2016 and this would not provide sufficient time to re-
tune the MP and conduct the necessary testing.  However, the meeting requested that the 
ESC provide advice on the relative merits of the Direct approach and the MP approach in 
the longer term (i.e. for the 2021-2023 quota block) and how this might be influenced by 
trends in which there may be greater participation by non-Member fleets as the stock 
rebuilds, or for other reasons. 
74. The meeting stressed the high importance of obtaining the best possible estimates of 
non-Member catch before CCSBT 23 and that the method used for estimating non-
 
Member catches needs be clearly described together with information on the fleets that 
are considered to be catching SBT.  In this context, the EC requested the ESC to further 
improve its estimates on non-Member catch and report back it in a transparent manner.  
It was noted that this is one of the tasks that the ESC had referred to its CPUE Modelling 
Group for consideration. It was also noted that the ESC had advised the EC, as a matter 
of urgency, to take steps to quantify all sources of UAM. The ESC had also requested the 
CC provide more data relating to Non-Member catch. 
75. The EC further noted that knowledge of the fleets involved in catching SBT is important 
so that the cooperation of those fleets can be sought and for considering how non-
Member fisheries can be regulated or controlled. 
 
9.3. Research Mortality Allowance 
76. The EC approved the requests from Australia and Japan for Research Mortality 
Allowances (RMA) totalling 7.7 t in 2016. 
 
9.4. Allocation of TAC 
77. Indonesia referred to the proposal it submitted to CCSBT 20 to increase its national 
allocation. It stated that the current allocation was too low in relation to its fishing 
capacity, which has a long history catching SBT, and that it submitted the proposal to 
accommodate the interests of its artisanal fishers. Indonesia again asked the EC to 
consider article 8(4c) of the Convention which states that in deciding upon allocations 
among the Parties 3, the Commission shall consider “the interests of Parties through 
whose exclusive economic or fishery zone southern bluefin tuna migrates”. 
78. Members shared sympathy for Indonesia’s position and noted that: 
• The EC has applied the Corrective Actions Policy to Indonesia by offering support 
from Members to provide advice to assist Indonesia in managing its allocation instead 
of seeking to reduce Indonesia’s allocation in relation to its overcatch; 
• Within the current quota block, Members allocations have already been committed 
and it would therefore be very difficult to consider Indonesia’s request within the 
current quota block; 
• The best opportunity to seek an increase in allocation will be when the TAC for the 
2018-2020 quota block is allocated in 2016.  However, even then there will be 
significant demands in relation to any increased quota in relation to matters such as: 
o Members seeking to use increases to assist with full accounting of their attributable 
catches (such as recreational fishing, artisanal fishing and discards); 
o Providing an allowance for unaccounted mortalities from non-Members; and 
o Returning to its nominal catch in the case of Japan. 
79. South Africa informed the meeting that it would also like to be considered for an 
increase of allocation and asked the EC to consider a sliding scale for future TAC 
increases, where Members with the least quota would receive the largest percentage 
increases in TAC. 
80. The allocations for 2016 and 2017 remain as specified in paper CCSBT-EC/1510/12.  
The allocations are provided in Table 1 below.

Agenda Item 10. 
CCSBT Strategic Plan and Fisheries Management Plan 
10.1. Action scheduled for 2015 
10.1.1. Flag State/Fishing Entity self-assessment of capacity 
81. Indonesia introduced paper CCSBT-EC/1510/29 on its self-assessment of fishing 
capacity. 
82. Members sought clarification on Indonesia’s fishing vessels of less than 30 gross 
tonnage and asked how many of them are artisanal, how many are semi-professional, 
and how they might be managed. Indonesia advised that vessels greater than 30 t are 
managed by the central government with its new CDS and quota management system, 
vessels of 5-30 t are managed by provincial governments, while vessels of less than 5 t 
don’t require a fishing permit. Indonesia advised that if the CCSBT was to give it extra 
quota for its vessels of less than 30 t then it would manage them with a similar approach 
to the larger vessels. 
 
10.2. Development of a Revised Strategic Plan 
83. The Secretariat presented paper CCSBT-EC/1510/13, on the draft revised Strategic Plan. 
4 These figures apportion the additional 110 t (from South Africa) to Japan because all other Members have reached their 
nominal allocation. 
 
                                                           
84. The meeting discussed the revised Strategic Plan, finalised previously unresolved text, 
made additional amendments and finalised the Action Plan. 
85. The meeting adopted the Strategic Plan which is provided at Attachment 14. 
86. Australia volunteered to prepare draft arrangements for subsidiary bodies aimed at 
providing greater consistency in the chairing arrangements for subsidiary bodies.  
Australia will consult with the Executive Secretary when developing the draft. 
87. The meeting tasked the Secretariat to investigate types of funding sources, other than 
Member governments’ assessed contributions, that other international organisations use 
for alternative funding arrangements. 
 
10.3. Consideration of a CCSBT Fisheries Management Plan (FMP) 
88. The Secretariat presented paper CCSBT-EC/1510/14, which contained a discussion 
paper on the possible contents of a Fisheries Management Plan (FMP), which was 
prepared and presented by New Zealand at SFMWG 4.  
89. Some Members noted that additional elements would need to be incorporated into the 
plan, such as priorities, timing, and benchmarks, and ensure that the plan was realistic 
and in-line with the capacity of the organisation. 
90. The meeting agreed that a FMP was a valuable document and supported the development 
of a FMP for the CCSBT, but that it would be difficult to allocate resources to its 
development in 2016. 
91. It was agreed that New Zealand would work intersessionally on developing a draft FMP 
to be considered by the EC in 2017, if its resources allow. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Revised Minimum Performance Requirements for Ecologically 
Related Species  
92. All Members are concerned about the interactions with ERS and Members wish to see 
reductions in the level of interactions. 
93. Australia presented paper CCSBT-EC/1510/22 which proposed a Resolution to Mitigate 
the Impact on Seabirds of Fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna. Australia elaborated that: 
• The ERSWG has repeatedly called on the EC to urgently implement more effective 
and binding ERS mitigation measures, as has the CCSBT Performance Review; 
• The CCSBT is seen as having inadequate measures in respect to seabird mitigation, 
and current seabird mortalities are unacceptably high with mortalities from Japan’s 
longline fleet last year possibly over 4000; and 
• The new proposal is substantially the same as last year’s with some changes to 
address concerns raised by Members. It still proposes the use of 2 of the 3 mitigation 
measures which are best-practice and are consistent with the measures of WCPFC, 
IOTC, and ICCAT. 
94. Some Members noted that the CCSBT remains the only tuna RFMO without a 
comprehensive set of binding measures to mitigate impacts of fishing on seabirds. 
95. All Members supported the proposal with the exception of Japan, which had the 
following concerns: 
 
• All waters where SBT fishing is conducted is covered by other RFMOs and therefore 
all CCSBT vessels are obliged to comply with the binding mitigation measures of 
those RFMOs by virtue of membership with those other RFMOs;  Introducing 
additional binding measures may cause confusion, particularly when one or more 
RFMOs update their measures; 
• SBT is often caught as a bycatch instead of being the primary target fishery; 
• The ERS Minimum Performance Requirements (MPRs) proposed by Japan provide 
the same mechanisms to check the performance and compliance to ERS measures; 
and 
• There was a question whether the CCSBT convention allows for binding measures for 
ecologically related species from an international law perspective. 
96. Response to Japan’s concerns, included that: 
• Some Members have received international law advice that introducing binding 
measures for ERS is feasible; 
• The proposed resolution does not increase obligations to fishing vessels; 
• Japan has much higher seabird mortalities in the SBT fishery than it has in its 
WCPFC and IOTC tuna fisheries. Its seabird mortalities in the SBT fishery have been 
increasing, suggesting that existing requirements are not sufficient and further action 
is required (Japan’s response is reflected in paragraph 27); and 
• MPRs are important but not sufficient to manage the issue, and a resolution is 
required in addition to those. 
97. Japan presented paper CCSBT-EC/1510/24 which provided Minimum Performance 
Requirements (MPRs) for measures relating to ecologically related species. The MPRs 
are to ensure compliance of the mitigation measures introduced by other RFMOs and 
Japan also reiterated its view that the proposed MPRs provide the same effectiveness as 
the proposed resolution. 
98. The EC agreed to adopt a modified version of the MPR proposal, which is provided at 
Attachment 15. 
99. Australia will re-introduce its proposal to CCSBT 23 and it will work with other 
Members to try to solve any issues in relation to the proposal. 
100. Some Members will be encouraging WCPFC to change the boundary for its seabird 
mitigation measures from 300S to 250S. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Admittance of new Member(s) to the Extended Commission 
101. The meeting discussed the European Union’s application (dated 29 April 2015) to 
become a Member of the CCSBT EC, and referred to paper CCSBT-EC/1510/15. 
102. The EU acknowledged that it had not yet been able to provide CDS import documents 
and that it is continuing to work on rectifying this item.  In addition, the EU confirmed 
that it will investigate intra-EU trade discrepancies for 2013 and 2014 as requested by 
CC 10. 
103. In response to Members’ questions, the EU confirmed that its catch for 2013, 2014 and 
2015 was 0 t, but for 2015 this is subject to final scientific validation. In addition, the EU 
 
confirmed its intention to maintain its current TAC of 10t to cover any potential SBT 
bycatch.  
104. Noting that as a CNM the EU has been actively participating in CCSBT processes, 
Members accepted the EU’s application and congratulated it on becoming a Member of 
the EC. 
105. A formal statement by the EU on its membership is provided at Attachment 16. 
 
Agenda Item 13. 
Cooperating Non-Members 
106. The EC agreed to confirm the continuing Cooperating Non-Member Status, South Africa 
and the Philippines. 
107. It was agreed that the Executive Secretary would write to the Philippines to express 
disappointment that the Philippines did not attend the annual meetings of the 
Compliance Committee or the Extended Commission.  The letter will request that the 
Philippines attend future annual meetings and that the Philippines respond to the request 
from the Compliance Committee in relation to the Philippines annual report. 
108. South Africa expressed appreciation for the renewal of its annual status and announced 
that it has improved its compliance with CCSBT measures.  South Africa repeated its 
earlier announcement that it will be seeking an increase in its allocation above 150 t once 
it becomes a Member of the CCSBT, and advised the meeting that it requests the EC to 
consider a sliding scale for future TAC increases, where Members with the least quota 
would receive the largest percentage increases in TAC.  South Africa further advised that 
it closed its SBT fishery on 14 October 2015 due to its catches reaching and slightly 
exceeding its allocation. 
109. The meeting noted that Fiji has not progressed its intention to lodge an application to 
become a Cooperating Non-Member. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
110. The Secretariat presented paper CCSBT-EC/1510/17 (Rev.1) on CCSBT’s relationship 
with non-Members and advised that Fiji, Singapore and the United States had been 
invited to attend the meetings of the Compliance Committee and Extended Commission.  
The Secretariat will repeat these invitations for CC 11 and CCSBT 23. 
111. The meeting noted that the United States has announced that it will commence providing 
CDS data to the Secretariat in 2016. 
112. The EC extended its appreciation to the United States for accepting the invitation and for 
its cooperation in the business of the CCSBT. 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Evaluation of Kobe Process Recommendations 
113. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/1510/18 on the Kobe process, 
noting the significant progress on the Consolidated List of Authorised Vessels (CLAV). 
 
114. It was noted that the next Kobe Steering Committee will be held in Malta on 18 
November 2015.  The Executive Secretary will attend remotely and the European Union 
agreed to investigate the possibility of providing someone to attend to represent the 
CCSBT at the Steering Committee meeting. 
 
Agenda Item 16. 
Activities with Other Organisations 
16.1. Reports from other RFMO meetings of interest  
115. The Chair introduced this item which is summarised in the Secretariat’s paper CCSBT-
EC/1510/19 on activities with other organisations. 
116. Member’s reports as observers to CCAMLR, IATTC ICCAT, IOTC and WCPFC were 
tabled. 
117. It was agreed that the following Members would act as Observers to other RFMOs on 
behalf of CCSBT during 2015/16: 
• Korea to continue as Observer to WCPFC; 
• Australia to continue as an Observer to CCAMLR; 
• Indonesia to continue as Observer to IOTC; 
• Japan to continue as an Observer to ICCAT; and 
• Taiwan to continue as an Observer to IATTC. 
 
16.2. Consideration of an MoU with ACAP  
118. The Meeting considered the draft Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the 
Secretariat of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and the 
Secretariat for the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, which is 
provided at Attachment 17.  The EC noted the valuable contributions of ACAP to the 
CCSBT and approved the signing of the MoU. 
 
16.3. 
Renewal of the Arrangement with CCAMLR  
119. The meeting also considered the Arrangement between CCSBT and CCAMLR which is 
due to be renewed in November 2015.   The EC agreed to an update of the arrangement, 
which is provided at Attachment 18.   
 
Agenda Item 17. 
Confidentiality of Data and Documents 
17.1.   Confidentiality of reports and documents from 2015 
120. The meeting agreed to an amendment to Rule 10 of the Rules of Procedure, to allow for 
an inter-sessional decision-making process on the release of meeting reports.  The agreed 
amendment to the Rules of Procedure is provided at Attachment 19. 
121. The Chair introduced paper CCSBT-EC/1510/20 (Rev.2) on the confidentiality of reports 
and documents submitted as meeting documents during 2015. 
 
122. The EC noted that with the exception of Attachment A of the Secretariat’s paper 
CCSBT-ESC/1509/04, Australia’s paper CCSBT-CC/1510/Info 03, and Japan’s paper 
CCSBT-CC/1510/19 and CCSBT-CC/1510/Info 04, the reports of meetings and 
documents submitted to meetings under the jurisdiction of CCSBT 22 would be made 
publicly available. 
 
Agenda Item 18. 
Meeting for 2016 
123. It was agreed that the following meetings and dates would apply for 2016: 
• Operating Model and Management Procedure Technical Meeting, in Kaohsiung, 
Taiwan from 3 – 4 September 2016; 
• The 21st Extended Scientific Committee meeting, in Kaohsiung, Taiwan from 5 – 10

125. The meeting agreed to hold a 3 day workshop on the review of the CDS in 2016, in 
Canberra. The workshop was tentatively agreed to be held in April with the exact dates 
to be determined by the Secretariat after confirmation of the availability of a suitable 
venue and after consultation with Members.  
 
Agenda Item 19.

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Anyoung hashimnikka 
On behalf of the Australian delegation I would like to extend our greetings to the 
Chair, to each of the delegations, to the Secretariat and to the observers at this 
meeting. 
In particular I thank our host, the South Korean Government, for the warm welcome 
to the beautiful city of Yeosu. 
I thank the Secretariat for their hard work leading up to this week. As always the 
quality and efficiency of their work has enabled us to arrive here ready to discuss the 
issues of highest importance to the Commission. I also thank the interpreters in 
advance, for what I know will be their usual tireless commitment to the task. 
From Australia’s perspective, success this week will include agreement to continue 
with a robust Management Procedure, a Scientific Research Program that adequately 
monitors the status of the stock, and commitment to a binding resolution on seabird 
bycatch mitigation. 
Australia welcomed members’ commitment at the 4th Strategy and Fisheries 
Management Working Group Meeting to equitably apportion the funding of the 2016 
aerial survey. The aerial survey is central to our current management procedure, 
which is the foundation of our rebuilding strategy for the SBT stock. There is 
international recognition of the achievement that the Extended Commission made in 
adopting the management procedure. Our recent performance review noted a range of 
completed actions, many of which are due to our adoption of the management 
procedure. This achievement was underpinned by substantial investment in research, 
testing and negotiations. It is important that we continue to build on this investment. 
Australia has high hopes that the Extended Commission will commit to the 
continuation of the current management procedure, particularly if the decision is made 
to transition to a new management procedure. This would ensure the Commission 
remains on the path to the agreed rebuilding target of 20 per cent of the original 
spawning stock biomass by 2035. Australia would have serious reservations about 
setting a three year TAC next year, if we do not have complete confidence in our 
monitoring of the rebuilding of the stock. We recognise that this poses a challenge, 
particularly for 2017, given the current budget. 
While the cost of maintaining our recruitment monitoring and management procedure 
is not small, it is in comparison to the potential lost opportunity that might accompany 
a failed management procedure or indeed a $375 million dollar value of the fishery. 
The CCSBT management procedure, and the science that underpins it, is world class. 
It took more than four years and substantial investment from members to develop – 
changing it is not a decision we should be taking lightly. The current science-based 
management procedure has delivered increases in total allowable catch, while 
providing confidence that we are on track to meet our rebuilding target. Continuing to 
fish a heavily depleted stock requires a robust, science-based management procedure, 
not least a reliable measure of recruitment and it is critical that the Commission 
continue to invest in the research that underpins our management. 
I will also take this opportunity to reiterate Australia’s determination for the Extended 
Commission to adopt a binding measure to reduce the impact of fishing for southern 
Bluefin tuna on seabirds. CCSBT remains behind the international standard for 
seabird bycatch mitigation. The revised measure we have provided responds to issues 
raised by members and presents an opportunity for the Commission to take action on 
this important issue.  
In closing, I again thank our hosts and all attendees. Australia is committed to 
working cooperatively with other members to ensure the Extended Commission meets 
its objectives this week and remains well placed to continue providing for the 
sustainability of the southern bluefin tuna stock. To this end, I look forward to several 
days of productive discussions and positive outcomes. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
Madam Chair, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, Good morning. 
 
On behalf of Taiwan delegation, I would like to extend our appreciation to the 
Government of Korea for choosing this beautiful venue, Expo 2012 Yeosu Korea, to 
hold this meeting. This is the second time for me to visit this city. Last time was in 
April 2014 for the Compliance Committee Working Group meeting of CCSBT. The 
Big-O multimedia show that we watched is still vivid in my mind. The excursion that 
we had yesterday was an excellent arrangement, giving us a chance of appreciating 
the beauty of ocean and mountain scenery of Korea. I believe that we all enjoyed very 
much. 
My thanks also go to the Executive Secretary, Mr. Kennedy, and his staff for their 
hard work in preparing meeting documents and all sorts of logistics for the meeting. I 
would also like to welcome the representatives of the South Africa and the European 
Union, who join us as Cooperating Non-Members, as well as observers from the 
United States of America, the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and 
Petrels (ACAP), the Humane Society International (HSI), and the TRAFFIC. 
For the purpose of reaching an interim SBT stock rebuilding target, we decided in 
2011 to use the Management Procedure (MP) to set the SBT global total allowable 
catch (TAC). This was a very important breakthrough for the CCSBT. Based on the 
stock assessment made for this year by the base case of MP, we can see a certain 
degree of improvement. While the stock remains at a very low level, but age 10 plus 
biomass relative to the initial estimates has shown an up-ward trend, and the 
probability of reaching rebuilding target has also shown a positive sign since the 2011 
stock assessment.  
For running MP, we need to consider a cost-effective scientific research program so 
as to obtain reliable index for stock assessment. Under the request made by the 
Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group meeting held in July this year, 
the Scientific Committee has provided us with valuable advice for our consideration. 
Nevertheless, the impact of unaccounted catch mortality to the stock assessment 
remains to be our concern. To conduct further investigation on this regard is needed. 
With respect to monitoring, control, and surveillance (MCS) measures adopted by the 
CCSBT, the following five measures are critical for ensuring the global TAC not to be 
overused. These five measures are Catch documentation scheme (CDS), 
transshipment program, vessel monitoring system (VMS), illegal, unreported and 
unregulated (IUU) vessel list, and records of authorized vessels and farms. 
In addition, for the possible adoption of the Port State Measures, which has proven to 
be effective in combating IUU fishing activities, the Compliance Committee has made 
a very constructive progress last week. As far as the Ecologically Related Species 
issue is concerned, since CCSBT is a trans-ocean fishery management body, we need 
to consider the harmonization of measures that we adopt in the CCSBT with those 
adopted by other tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). 
In closing, I look forward to working with all members and Co-operating Non-
members in the following days to achieve positive outcomes for the sustainability of 
SBT fishery. 
Thank you, Madam Chair. 
Attachment 4 – 3 
 
Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
Thank you Chair for the floor and good morning distinguished delegates. 
Firstly, On behalf of Indonesia delegation, we would like to extend our appreciation to 
Korean Government for hosting this meeting in this beautiful city. 
We also would like to express similar appreciation to Executive Secretary of CCSBT 
and his entire staff, who have made a good effort to well prepare of this important 
meeting. 
Distinguished delegates, 
I would like to take this opportunity to briefly describe our concern in SBT fisheries 
that we have agreed to manage it by global catch quota basis. In this scenario, 
members are expected to provide all relevant data and information, as well as, 
harvesting SBT based on their own annual catch quota allocation. For this reason, we 
understand that members’ commitment to comply with all adopted resolutions is very 
substantial. 
After having made efforts within 6 years to fulfill our obligation, we understand that 
we could not meet a minimum performance requirement as adopted by CCSBT 
Commission, particularly in providing scientific data that was taken from observer on-
board program, as well as, in controlling annual-catch quota utilization. As a 
conclusion, we realized that there is a potential non-compliance issues of Indonesia. 
We admitted that QAR phase 1 and phase 2 have been completed and some findings 
and recommendation are very helpful Indonesia to prepare annual action plan in order 
to increase our performance. However, we need some more time to implement the 
recommendation. We appreciate very much members’ support in this regards. 
By having described the weakness of Indonesia, please allow me to share a minor 
achievement already made such as (i) we have been able to legally distribute “2015 
annual catch quota to 17 companies”, and by this scenario, we are optimistic that there 
will be no over-catch caused by vessels greater than 30 GT in this fishing year and (ii) 
we have developed CDS application system to eliminate some errors occurred at the 
previous year. We plan to keep moving forward to strengthen the national effort in 
SBT fisheries. 
In addition to the above issue, we need to share this commission meeting the 
complexity of Indonesia tuna fisheries, such as (a) SBT is considered as bycatch or 
un-intended bycatch to artisanal vessels, (b) a huge number of fleet with the wide-
range of size involved, (c) a lot of people depend their live on tuna fisheries including 
SBT, (d) SBT migrates within Indonesia fisheries management zone. 
In this situation, annual catch quota from technical point of view can actually be 
easily distributed but it will create a serious social problem that may not be easy to 
settle due to interest of artisanal fishers. Therefore the issue of catch quota distribution 
tend to become social and/or livelihood interest rather than technical issue, 
particularly to artisanal fishers. 
Finally, let me reiterate the extended commission meeting regarding the article 8.4.c 
stipulating that “in deciding upon allocation among the parties under paragraph 3 
above “the Commission shall consider the interest of Parties through whose exclusive 
economic of fishery zones southern bluefin tuna migrates”. 
We believe, by accommodating the interest of artisanal fishers under this article, we 
still be able to achieve the objective of this organization as stipulated in article 3 
stipulates that “The objective of this convention is to ensure, through appropriate 
management, the conservation and optimum utilization of southern Bluefin tuna”. 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by Japan 
 
Good morning. I would like to say a few words on behalf of Japanese delegation. 
First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to Korean Government 
for hosting the 22nd Annual Commission Meeting in this beautiful harbor city of 
Yeosu. In Chinese characters, “Yeosu” is shown as “beautiful water”. We have been 
heartily enjoying our stay here, in the literature, with beautiful ocean. I would also 
express my sincere gratitude to Korea for the pleasant excursion yesterday, we were 
able to really enjoy this city.   
I would like to also extend our thanks to Mr. Kennedy and the Secretariat staff for 
their excellent work in organising the meeting and facilitating smooth discussion as 
usual. In addition, I would like to congratulate our new Chair, Ms Kwon. I feel sure 
we will have positive outcomes under Ms Kwon’s proper leadership at this meeting. 
At the Extended Scientific Committee meeting (ESC) held in in Incheon, Korea last 
month, it discussed the global Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for 2015-2017 and 
recommended that there is no need to revise the EC’s 2013 TAC decision regarding 
the TACs for 2016-17. Ensuring and providing stable conditions for fishing industry’s 
operation is very important matter for us, thus we hope the Commission will confirm 
this recommendation at this meeting accordingly.     
In addition, the scientific aerial survey (AS) which has not occurred in 2015 must be 
conducted in 2016 so that the TAC for next three-year could be recommended using 
the current Management Procedure (MP).  
Furthermore, at the ESC, there was a very important discussion on the setting TAC 
using MP in future. That is, for ensuring continual use of MP in future, alternative 
approach using new recruitment index, instead of AS index which has administrative 
problems, will be needed. In relation to this, the ESC has provided  a new idea for us. 
At this meeting, I would like to have close discussion on this issue including financial 
aspects with all Members and Cooperative Non-Members, while considering on the 
future of CCSBT.     
In addition, we are facing some outstanding issues need to be resolved for the 
conservation, management and sustainable use of Southern Bluefin Tuna, including 
how to check the mortality of recreational catch which might become huge amount 
and when we introduce the stereo video camera for verifying all SBT transfer to 
farming cages. We are considering the plan for proceeding on these issues in a 
strategic way.   
For Ecologically Related Species (ERS), we should take into account the fact that, in 
all oceans, ERS related binding measures for longline fisheries have been already 
adopted and implemented by each tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisation 
under their jurisdictions. On the basis of this fact, I would like to discuss how CCSBT 
should address this important matter. 
In the light of the objective of the Commission, we shall resolve each of these issues 
in the good faith and with cooperative spirit. I hope we are able to make a very 
important step for the future development of CCSBT during this week. 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa. Ngā mihi nui ki a koutou 
 
On behalf of the New Zealand delegation I would like to firstly thank our host Korea 
for their welcome and the pleasant excursion that was provided yesterday.  It was a 
welcome break before we face the challenges of this Commission meeting.  I would 
also like to extend our thanks to the Secretariat and our greetings to other delegations 
and meeting participants. 
As always, New Zealand looks forward to further constructive dialogue on the 
important business of this Commission.  Notably the decisions at this meeting will 
determine the future scientific program of the Commission.  Despite the financial 
challenges these may present we should ensure that we provide our Scientific 
Committee with the resources necessary to gather the information it needs  
At the risk of repetition, New Zealand remains concerned about the status of the 
southern bluefin stock and we reiterate our view that we need to be cautious in our 
approach to its management.  However, reflecting on the positive outcomes of last 
year’s meeting we now have a clear pathway to ensure that all southern bluefin tuna 
mortalities including recreational catch and discards are to be counted against the 
national allocation. This will make a real difference to the sustainability of the stock 
and we must pursue this path with vigour. It was pleasing to note the reports of some 
members to the Compliance Committee that they were actively moving down this 
path and we encourage others to follow suit 
We have also commenced the process of collectively quantifying and allowing for 
non-member catches of southern bluefin tuna.  Along with all our other improvements 
this again will make a difference to the future management of the southern bluefin 
tuna stock. 
We remain keen to see resolution of some of the issues that seem to have engaged this 
Commission in endless debate in the past.  Firstly, we must base our decisions on the 
best scientific information possible and we therefore have a responsibility to provide 
our Scientific Committee with the information it needs to do its job in resolving some 
of the remaining uncertainty in the assessment of the SBT stock.  Secondly as a 
responsible management organisation we must be clear on our approach to mitigating 
the impact of our fisheries on ecologically related species and actively pursue 
improvements in this area. 
New Zealand is of the view  that members are bound by their commitment to comply 
with ERS measures applied by other RFMOs when fishing for southern bluefin tuna 
but considers that a specific measure adopted by this Commission would improve 
clarity on this issue. 
We also have the opportunity to collectively advocate for improvements in the 
measures adopted by other RFMOs so that the efforts of our fishing vessels are not 
undermined by the activities of others.  In this respect I would encourage members to 
support a change to the southern boundary of the seabird measure applying in the 
western Pacific Ocean, moving it from 30 to 25 degrees south in order to mitigate 
captures of vulnerable seabirds that are not aware of this boundary  
It is clear that this Commission has made considerable progress in recent years and 
members have worked hard to achieve this.  The challenge now is how we maintain 
our reputation as a credible and forward thinking regional management organisation 
in the management of this valuable resource.  Investment in the future, cooperation 
and transparent information exchange will assist us in meeting this challenge.

Opening Statement by Republic of Korea 
 
Thank you, Madame Chair. 
 
On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Korea, I would like to welcome the 
Chairs, the Secretariat and the delegations of the Members, Cooperating Non-
members and Observers to the 22nd session of the Extended Commission for the 
Conservation and Management of Southern Bluefin Tuna.  
At the Compliance Committee last week, the Members and Cooperating Non-
members had intensive and constructive discussions and produced fruitful 
recommendations to the Extended Commission, including a draft resolution on port 
state inspection. In this regard, I would like to extend Korea’s special appreciation to 
our out-going Compliance Committee Chair Mr. Crothers for his excellent leadership 
for many years. I am convinced that the in-coming CC Chair Mr. Meere will build on 
the great work that he has done. 
It has been four years since the Extended Commission adopted the Management 
Procedure. For the last four years, the Extended Commission has kept on moving 
forward. We introduced a Quality Assurance Review system, Minimum Performance 
Requirements and the Strategic Plan. Scientific advice indicates that SBT resources 
may be showing signs of recovery and we are heading to the right direction. However, 
we are well aware that this does not mean that we can sit back and relax. Rather, we 
need to gear up our efforts to meet our established goal.  
Counting in all sources of mortality and attribute those mortalities to each Member 
and Cooperating Non-member’s national allocation would be an important step 
towards the goal. It is also closely related to improving data collection, which will be 
essential for robust science that supports the conservation and management of SBT. 
While we work to ensure the full compliance of Members and Cooperating Non-
members with all relevant resolutions, recommendations and decisions, we also need 
to closely monitor non-member SBT catches and trades to narrow any gaps that may 
exist from the vessel to the market. 
The CCSBT has a reputation as an RFMO with effective and efficient conservation 
and management mechanisms. The signature system of MP is being counted as one of 
the best practices of resource management and other RFMOs are trying to walk down 
a similar path. As a Member of the CCSBT, Korea is very proud of these 
accomplishments. 
At the 22nd session, we have a host of important issues on the table. Though we do 
not see eye-to-eye on all issues, I believe we will somehow find the way to 
demonstrate the world our solidarity with the common goal of the conservation and 
optimal utilization of SBT resources. In this vein, Korea will make its due 
contribution to the progress toward the attainment of our interim goal by 2035.  
Before closing, I would like to once again welcome all of you to this beautiful city 
Yeosu and I hope you will enjoy your stay and bring home wonderful memories with 
you.  
Thank you.

Opening Statement by European Union 
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
First of all, the European Union would like to thank the Republic of Korea for hosting 
this meeting in the coastal city of Yeosu, which was also the host city of the Expo 
2012. The European Union is very pleased to be present at the annual meeting of the 
CCSBT. 
The EU is a global player in fisheries both as producer and as the world’s largest 
importer of fish and fish products: The EU has vessels in all oceans and consumes 
about 25 % of the world’s fish resources in value, and imports 70 % of its 
consumption. However, 85 % of the world’s fish resources are either fully exploited 
or overexploited, according to assessments. The EU feels therefore compelled to act 
responsibly and reverse this trend on all levels, including in all RFMOs. In this regard, 
we acknowledge the steps taken by CCSBT to address the precarious situation of SBT 
stocks. 
As an active member of 15 RFMOs, and as Cooperating Non-Member to the CCSBT, 
the EU continues to be committed to ensuring compliance with conservation and 
management measures. We take possible instances of non-compliance by the EU very 
seriously. We will continue to ensure full EU compliance with CCSBT measures. 
This annual meeting is of particular relevance for the EU. CCSBT 22 will be 
discussing key matters like the adoption of PSM, the revision of the CCSBT Strategic 
Plan, a Resolution on Ecologically Related Species or the best way to address TAC in 
the next years.  
But, most notably this meeting will be also discussing the European Union's 
application to become Member of the CCSBT Extended Commission. 
Since 2006, the EU is Cooperating Non-Member of the CCSBT Extended 
Commission. Together, we have come a long way since modifying the CCSBT 
Extended Commission rules in 2013 in order to allow for the EU to strengthen its 
participation in CCSBT. We are grateful for those amendments that, two years later, 
have allowed us to submit and discuss our request for Membership of the Extended 
Commission at this meeting.   
We confirm our interest. We are committed to stronger links with CCSBT and to an 
even more successful cooperation with CCSBT as full Members of the Extended 
Commission.  
We look forward to participating in this meeting and hope it will be a productive and 
successful one. 
Attachment 5 – 2 
 
Opening Statement by Republic of South Africa 
 
Chairperson, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
On behalf of the Republic of South Africa, we would like to express our gratitude to 
the Government of the Republic South Korea for gracious hospitality extended to us 
and for the hosting the 22nd Annual meeting of the Commission for the Conservation 
of Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) in this wonderful city of Yeosu. We also wish to 
compliment the Secretariat for the excellent work of organizing the meeting in this 
beautiful venue. 
It is a great pleasure to announce that the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa 
has adopted the accession to CCSBT, IOTC and PSMA during its joint seating of last 
month as required by the our Constitution. We are now in the process of preparing the 
relevant documentation and we envisage that the instrument will be deposited before 
the end of the year or at the latest at the beginning of 2016. 
Chairperson, allow us to reiterate South Africa’s commitment to implementing 
management measures adopted by the Commission. Such is evident in the measures 
implemented to manage its small SBT allocation, including but not limited to; South 
Africa has implemented very high MCS standards, and requires: VMS on all long line 
vessels, Observer coverage on 100% of charter vessels, Vessel quotas for the tuna 
longline fishery, 100% Monitoring of landings, discarding/releasing of all Southern 
Blue Fin tuna when the fishery is closed, Implementation of tags, CTs and CMFs and 
Prohibition of Southern Blue Fin landings in other commercial tuna fisheries. As a 
port state South Africa has also closely monitored vessels with Southern Blue Fin and 
required confirmation by flag states before foreign vessels were allowed to enter port. 
We are continuing with the process of rebuilding capacity to enhance management of 
this resources and I hope improvement has been noticed in respect of reports as 
opposed to previous year. 
The only other improvement remaining is to move from an Olympic system to a quota 
system for swordfish longline vessels. It stands to reason that substantial increase in 
our allocation will be required in order for us to continue improving our processes as 
these require injection of funds. It is therefore not a secret that we intend to continue 
with the call for progressive increase allocation to ensure fair allocation among 
member states. In view of our good record, we hope that members will support South 
Africa’s endeavors to find win-win solution to this important question of equitable 
allocation of SBT among member states. 
While we are confident of completing the accession process, we acknowledge that we 
might not be able to complete that process on time. To the end, we have submitted a 
request and hoping that the 22nd Annual meeting of the Commission will positively 
consider South Africa’s application for the renewal of its Co-operating, Non-
Contracting status. 
Attachment 6 – 1 
 
Opening Statement by the United States 
 
I would like to begin by again thanking the Government of Korea for hosting this 
meeting and both Korea and the Secretariat for the excellent meeting arrangements.   
The United States would also like to express its appreciation to Members for 
extending the invitation to attend the 10th Meeting of the Compliance Committee and 
22st Meeting of the Extended Commission.   
International cooperation is critical to ensure that the global seafood supply is safe, 
sustainable, and legally harvested, and the United States continues to seek the help of 
its international partners in these efforts.  Last year President Obama established a 
Presidential Task Force to Combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing and 
Seafood Fraud, and this Interagency Task Force developed recommendations for the 
implementation of a comprehensive framework of integrated programs to combat IUU 
fishing and seafood fraud.  These recommendations include analysis of monitoring, 
control, and surveillance measures in regional fisheries management organizations 
and development of a seafood traceability program to help prevent the trade of 
illegally harvested fisheries products in US markets. 
The United States would like to congratulate CCSBT Members for their approval at 
the Compliance Committee of proposals to require IMO numbers for eligible vessels 
on the authorized vessel list, additional improvements to the catch documentation 
scheme measure, and minimum standards for port inspection.  We believe these types 
of measures are crucial in combating IUU fishing. 
As announced at the Compliance Committee meeting, the United States worked with 
the Secretariat intersessionally to determine how to best share information regarding 
US participation the CCSBT CDS program, and will start sharing CDS import data 
with the Secretariat in 2016.  We hope this information will assist in better tracking 
the global trade of southern bluefin tuna, and we look forward to working with the 
Secretariat and CCSBT Members to ensure the United States is participating in the 
program as effectively as possible. 
The United States also encourages the Extended Commission to continue working to 
implement the recommendations from the second performance review of the CCSBT 
and the Kobe process, as well as adopt binding measures to mitigate seabird bycatch.  
I look forward to a productive and successful meeting.  Thank you.

Opening Statement by Humane Society International 
 
This 22nd annual meeting is one where members will make important decisions on 
Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) conservation, and impacts on Ecologically Related 
Species (ERS). HSI very much appreciates being able to participate as an observer.  
The long-awaited adoption of the first Management Procedure (MP) was applauded 
by HSI and therefore the current uncertainty surrounding its continuance is of great 
concern. Despite the combination of MP-threatening exceptional circumstances 
indicated by the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC), it is hoped every effort will be 
made to maintain the current MP.  
In support of the ESC's preferred management option A, HSI hopes the SBT 
rebuilding objectives are retained but more conservative parameters are included in 
any renewed MP. This is necessary due to the extent of Unaccounted Mortalities 
(UAM's) and ongoing inadequate quantification and containment of ERS impacts.  
HSI would like to point out to Members that under the agreed TAC increases for 2015 
to 2017, an additional 850 albatrosses per year will die on hooks. For every bird 
killed, 20 or more baits are lost to birds. This economic cost alone should be sufficient 
incentive to end the protracted reluctance of some fishing states over adoption of 
mandatory mitigation measures by CCSBT.  
These measures should include mandating appropriate line weighting by all vessels in 
all regions, regardless of any other means used to protect baits from birds.  Measures 
adopted by other tuna RFMOs allowing fishers to choose not to use line weighting is 
a recipe for ineffectiveness.  Developing compliance verification capability across the 
90% of longline fishing that is currently not observed should be a priority.  
The 2012 ERSWG9 meeting clearly stated that, for high-risk bird areas, all three 
specific mitigation measures are necessary and yet three years later, despite urgent 
reminders from the ERSWG, there is little tangible evidence of more effective 
measure implementation or progress to actually define ‘High Risk’ areas within which 
use of all three measures would be mandated. Dealing with TAC and MP 
uncertainties might be the immediate commercial priority issue for Members but it is 
critical that conservation issues are now addressed, having been neglected during the 
process of creating the Commission's first MP. HSI urges Members to not allow this 
to occur yet again.  It is time for CCSBT to adopt its own albatross protection 
measures for the SBT fishery for which it is responsible, based on its own advice 
rather than trying to pass off the responsibility to other organizations.   
To finish on a positive note, HSI would like to acknowledge the tremendous 
achievements by all, particularly the Secretariat recently toward creating consistent, 
accurate and comprehensive Reporting Requirements and hopes that necessary 
refinement continues. A great outcome will be this Commission establishing data 
acquisition and reporting requirement standards for other RFMO's to emulate.  
Thank you Chair and Members for your time.

Opening Statement by TRAFFIC 
 
Thank you Madam Chair. 
 
Madam Chair, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
First of all, we would like to thank the Government of the Republic of Korea for 
hosting this meeting in this beautiful city of Yeosu. TRAFFIC would also like to 
thank the Commission for the opportunity to participate as an observer to meetings of 
the Commission, Extended Commission and its other subsidiary bodies. We look 
forward to contributing to these critical deliberations.  
TRAFFIC remains concerned with the status of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) 
stock and believe a cautious approach to the stock assessment, Management 
Procedure (MP) and setting of the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is needed.  
While the annual TAC has been increased recently, the stock is estimated to be at a 
very low level – approximately 9% of the initial Spawning Stock Biomass, which is 
well below the level to be considered biologically safe. Therefore we ask the 
Commission to define the long-term biologically safe target of rebuilding for the 
Southern Bluefin tuna stock with the Precautionary Principle in mind.  
It is time we moved from having an interim target so as to give certainty to the global 
community that CCSBT has the long term interests of SBT conservation at the heart 
of its decision making, rather than generous short term National Allocations. 
Considering the importance of independent sources of fishery information for the MP, 
TRAFFIC is seriously concerned that the scientific aerial survey was not conducted 
this year. We urge the Commission to allocate adequate funding to maintain the 
scientific aerial survey every year until the gene tagging method is well developed and 
proven, if need be, to be a satisfactory alternative recruitment index.  
TRAFFIC does not support returning to solely relying on CPUE data and consider it 
would be viewed by many as stepping back from what has been adopted as 
responsible management through the MP and agreed inputs. 
Unaccounted mortality catch remains an important issue due to under-reporting by 
Members, as well as other factors including discarding and live release, Non-Member 
catch and recreational catch. Total unaccounted mortalities may be large enough to 
reduce the probability of reaching the rebuilding target from 74% to below 50%.  
Additionally, the over-catch of 350 tonnes by Members and Cooperating Non-
Members was confirmed in 2014. These critical shortfalls in total accountability 
undermine the integrity and comprehensiveness of the stock assessment model and the 
credibility of the outcomes of the MP and TAC setting process. 
Thus TRAFFIC urges the Commission to collect information and data on the 
unaccounted mortalities as a matter of urgency to enable the Scientific Committee to 
evaluate whether this would be exceptional circumstances. We note that non-
compliance, such as over-catch and including unaccounted mortalities, are considered 
to be Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated catch and therefore should be dealt with 
using appropriate levels of concern.  
With respect to Ecologically Related Species (ERS), we encourage the Commission to 
instruct the Scientific Committee to gather information on the catch of sharks listed in 
the appendix of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
Fauna and Flora (CITES) and provide parameters for the Southern Hemisphere 
population of Porbeagle shark for conducting CITES non-detriment findings. This 
will allow for the issuing of CITES permits for trade in a regionally coordinated way.  
TRAFFIC urges Members to make the necessary decisions, with the required sense of 
urgency, in order to conserve effectively SBT and other ERS, especially sharks, 
seabirds and marine turtles.  
As a final note to the Commissioners, we ask that this week the plenary of the 
Commission remains the forum for discussions and decisions so that we can all 
participate, thus ensuring that the CCSBT process can be open and transparent.  
 
Thank you, Madam Chair. 
Attachment 7 
 
Report of the Finance and Administration Committee 
 
Dr. Kevin Sullivan (New Zealand) agreed to chair the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC). The FAC was tasked with the following agenda: 
• Revision of the 2015 budget 
• Draft 2016 budget 
• Indicative budgets for 2017 and 2018 
 
The revised budget for 2015 
The Executive Secretary gave a summary of the 2015 revised budget outlined in 
CCSBTEC/1510/05 that provides savings in five of the six cost centres of the budget. 
The revision incorporates actual income and expenditure as at 31 August 2015 
together with forecast income and expenditure for the remainder of the year. There 
were no changes to the Revised 2015 budget proposed by the Executive Secretary in 
the FAC meeting. 
Final income for 2014 is estimated to be 1.3% higher than the amount approved at 
CCSBT21 for 2015. The slightly increased income is due to improved return on 
investments of $8,416 (largely due to prompt contribution payments by Members that 
allowed maximum use of term deposits), increased returns of $19,421 from the Staff 
Assessment Levy and a withdrawal of savings of $20,000 to cover the costs of 
developing a new website. 
There are only two items of forecast expenditure with a significant increase over the 
approved budget: 
• “Independent Chairs”: an increase of 44% to provide for the new Compliance 
Chair to attend the CC and EC meetings in 2015. 
• “Development of new website”: This unbudgeted item ($20,000) was 
presented to Members in Circulars #2015/024 and #2015/033 and is funded 
from the Secretariat’s cash reserves. 
The most significant saving was $100,000 due to the aerial survey not proceeding in 
2015. The expenditure for 2015 is estimated to be 8.7% lower than the amount 
approved for 2015. A surplus of $219,096 is now estimated for 2015, and it is 
proposed that this surplus be carried forward as income into the 2016 budget, in 
accordance with CCSBT’s Financial Regulations. 
The FAC thanked the Executive Secretary for the work done on the budget.  
The FAC recommends that the revised budget for 2015 at Annex A be agreed by the 
Extended Commission. 
 
The draft budget for 2016 and indicative budgets for 2017 and 2018 
The FAC considered the proposed budgets outlined in CCSBT-EC/1510/06. The draft 
2016 budget was extensively revised following discussion of the Scientific Research 
Programme in the Commission meeting and the accession of the European Union to 
the Commission on the first day of the EC meeting. The addition of EU to the EC will 
result in the EU paying a 50% contribution for 2015 and a full contribution for 2016. 
The payment required from the EU in 2015 is $39,495. This will have an impact on 
the contribution of all Members for 2016 as shown in Table 1.

The budget for 2016 was discussed in the Commission and the FAC and the following 
changes were made to the budget (changes shown here are those where the value of 
changes was greater than $3,000): 
The FAC recommended the following additional expenditure for 2016: 
• The FAC was asked to consider salary increases for the Secretariat staff as 
these have fallen behind those of other RFMOs. It was agreed to adjust these 
over the next 3-4 years to ensure the Secretariat can retain staff and mitigate 
the risk of having to find suitable new technical staff with the associated 
recruitment costs. This will eventually result in a regrading of staff at level P3 
level to P4 and staff at the P5 level to D1. The increases will initially be 
applied to the Compliance and Data Managers. Secretariat costs: $15,000  
The FAC recommended the following reductions in expenditure for 2016: 
• Hire of venue and catering $100,000 
• ESC meeting $25,600 
• OMMP meeting $19,500 
• ADMD contribution $12,800 
• Close-kin genetics $119,000 
• Assistance to developing states $12,500 
• Chair of ERSWG participation in tRFMOs $4,800 
• Quality Assurance review $26,000 
 
The FAC noted the substantial contribution of CSIRO to the various research 
programmes (20% for the aerial survey, 40% for the pilot gene tagging and 30% for 
the close-kin genetics) and thanked Australia for their support of the SRP. 
 
 
Scientific Research Programme (SRP) 
The FAC reported back to the Commission on the impact of the SRP on the budget 
for each year from 2016 to 2018. The Commission agreed on the priority to move to 
gene-tagging as the preferred method to estimate recruitment to the SBT stock. After 
discussing the relative value and costs of the various elements of the SRP (e.g. gene-
tagging, aerial survey, close-kin genetics) there was agreement for Option A proposed 
by the ESC (CCSBT-EC/15/10/Rep02). This includes an aerial survey in 2017, 
implementation of a long-term gene tagging programme and processing of the close-
kin samples from 2016 onwards (to prevent growth of the sample backlog). 
These decisions on the SRP puts a lot of pressure on the Commission budget in 2017 
if Members require contributions to be limited to a maximum increase of 10% in any 
year. The FAC discussed where savings could be made in the 2017 indicative budget 
and agreed the following: 
• As host for the CCSBT meetings in 2017 Indonesia offered to pay all the costs 
of the EC meeting related to hire of venue and equipment and catering. 
• Australia offered a one-off contribution of $175,000 toward the gene tagging 
pilot project to fill the funding gap in 2017 
• EU to explore the possibility of a contribution towards the costs of gene 
tagging and close kin work in 2017 
• If South Africa joins the Commission in the first half of 2016 they will 
contribute a full share for 2016 and ongoing contributions from 2017. This 
will provide roughly $200,000 additional funds in the 2017 budget. 
The indicative budget for 2018 is not expected to result in much change from 2017, as 
currently there is less research proposed (e.g. no aerial survey). In 2018 EU will be 
hosting the meetings of the Commission and they have indicated a possible 
contribution to meeting cost of 80%. 
Recommended Budget 2016 
The FAC agreed to recommend the General Budget for the Extended Commission in 
2016 as set out in Annex B to this document. The Extended Commission is asked to 
note that because of the accession of the European Union to the Commission in 2015, 
the percentage increase in contributions for 2016 vary for each Member.  However, 
increased contributions for any Member do not exceed 10% in 2016.  Indicative 
budgets for 2017 and 2018 have also been considered and these constrain the % 
increase for 2017 and 2018 to 10% or less of the previous year’s contribution. This 
assumes accession of South Africa to the EC in the first half of 2016 and voluntary 
contributions from Australia and the EU in 2017. 
The contribution required from Members in 2016 is that listed in the approved budget 
for 2016 minus the amounts in Table 1.

Introduction 
A strategic plan for the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna 
This strategic plan outlines a common vision for how Members would like to see the 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in the future. Components 
of that vision include the state of the southern bluefin tuna stock; how the Commission 
operates to effectively manage the stock; and how Members are implementing their 
obligations and benefiting from their successful management of the stock.  
 
A strategic plan outlines not only a desired future state, but also specific strategies and 
tasks associated with achieving the desired future state (even if achieving that state is a 
long term goal). A recent review of the Commission’s performance provided many 
suggestions for ongoing performance improvements. A strategic plan allows these 
suggested actions to be incorporated, as appropriate, into future work plans. Suggested 
actions are prioritised so that the overall work plan is achievable.  
 
The performance review also recommended development of a management plan that 
would be complementary to the strategic plan and will provide a greater level of 
operational detail. 
 
Within this document, all references to ‘Members’ includes Cooperating Non-
Members (CNMs) and all references to the ‘Commission’ includes the Extended 
Commission. 
The Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
Origins  
Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) were heavily fished in the past, with annual catches 
reaching 80,000 tonnes in the early 1960s. Heavy fishing resulted in a significant 
decline in the numbers of mature fish, and the annual catch began to fall rapidly.  
In the mid-1980s it became apparent that a way of limiting catches was needed. To 
enable the SBT stocks to rebuild, the main nations fishing SBT at the time – Australia, 
Japan and New Zealand – began to apply strict quotas to their fishing fleets from 1985.  
On 20 May 1994, the voluntary management arrangement between Australia, Japan 
and New Zealand was formalised when the Convention for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna, which the three countries signed in May 1993, came into force.  
The role of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
The objective of the Convention is to ensure, through appropriate management, the 
conservation and optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna. The Convention created 
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) and 
describes how it operates and functions. The functions of the CCSBT include— 
• collecting information,  
• deciding on a total allowable catch (TAC) and its allocation,  
• deciding on additional measures including monitoring, control, and 
surveillance (MCS) measures considered necessary in order to achieve 
effective implementation of the Convention,  
2 
• agreeing an annual budget, and  
• encouraging accession by other states. 
 
The CCSBT meets annually. The CCSBT has five subsidiary bodies which provide 
advice on their areas of expertise— 
• the Scientific Committee (SC)/Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) (along 
with other technical working groups that may be required to complete its work, 
such as the Operating Model and Management Procedure (OMMP) Technical 
Meeting),  
• Ecologically Related Species Working Group (ERSWG),  
• the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group (SFMWG),  
• Compliance Committee (CC),  
• the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC).  
 
A panel of independent scientists attend ESC meetings and are able to provide advice 
directly to the CCSBT if required.  
The Convention also provided for the establishment of the CCSBT Secretariat, which 
supports the running of the Commission. The Secretariat is based in Canberra, 
Australia. Staff include an Executive Secretary, Deputy Executive Secretary, a Data 
Manager, Compliance Manager, and an Administration Officer.  
The Commission has adopted a relatively devolved mode of operation, with a small 
Secretariat staff and most core functions (such as provision of science and monitoring, 
control, and surveillance services) done directly by Members, sometimes in line with 
standards established by the Commission. 
Membership of the Commission 
Membership of the CCSBT is only open to States. To facilitate the participation of 
fishing entities, the CCSBT established by resolution the extended CCSBT (ECCSBT) 
and the Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) in 2001 and revised the resolution in 
2013 to accommodate REIOs. Membership of the ECCSBT and the ESC includes all 
parties to the Convention, fishing entities, and REIOs may also be admitted. The 
fishing entity of Taiwan was admitted in 2002. An application by the European Union 
to be admitted to the Extended Commission will be considered in 2015. 
The ECCSBT and the ESC perform the same functions as the CCSBT and the SC 
respectively. Each Member has equal voting rights. Decisions of the ECCSBT that are 
reported to the CCSBT become decisions of the CCSBT unless the CCSBT agrees 
otherwise. Any decision of the Commission that affects the operation of the ECCSBT 
or the rights, obligations, or status of any individual Member within the ECCSBT 
should not be taken without prior due deliberation of that issue by the ECCSBT. 
Currently the ECCSBT consists of six Members and three Cooperating Non-Members: 
Members 
• Australia 
• Fishing entity of Taiwan (member of the ECCSBT only) 
• Indonesia 
• Japan 
• New Zealand 
• Republic of Korea 
3 
 
Cooperating Non-Members 
• European Union 
• Philippines 
• South Africa 
The southern bluefin tuna fishery 
Characterisation of the fishery 
The primary market for SBT is the Japanese Sashimi market, where premium prices 
can be obtained, largely because of the high fat content of SBT flesh.  
The main methods used for catching SBT are longline fishing and purse seining.  
Longlining involves using long lengths of fishing line with many hooks. The SBT 
caught are mainly frozen at very low temperatures (-60C) and either unloaded at 
intermediate ports and shipped to markets in Japan or unloaded directly at markets in 
Japan. 
Purse seining involves using purse seine nets to enclose schools of SBT. This method 
is currently only used in the Australian SBT fishery. The enclosed schools of fish are 
towed to waters near the Australian mainland and placed in floating cages anchored to 
the ocean floor. The tuna are fattened for several months and sold direct to export 
markets as frozen or chilled fish.  
Status of the stock 
As noted above, the SBT stock was historically subject to high levels of fishing 
pressure and remains in a depleted state. CCSBT has adopted a Management 
Procedure – a pre-agreed set of rules that can specify changes to the TAC based on 
updated monitoring data – with the aim of rebuilding the stock based on scientific 
guidance on TAC setting.  
The 2014 assessment suggested that the SBT stock remains at a very low state, 
estimated to be 9% of the initial spawning stock biomass, and well below the level 
required to produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY). There has been some 
improvement since the 2011 stock assessment, and fishing mortality is assessed as 
being below the level associated with MSY.  
The 2014 assessment included sensitivity analysis around all sources of unaccounted 
catch mortality. The Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) noted that it appears that 
significant levels of unaccounted mortality may have occurred which were not 
considered in the design of the Management Procedure, and that if these levels are 
accurate, they would amount to exceptional circumstances because the probability of 
rebuilding under the Management Procedure will be well below what was intended by 
the Commission. 
The ESC also noted that continuing to follow the Management Procedure as proposed 
does lead to continued rebuilding in the short term even if the circumstances of the 
hypothesised additional unaccounted mortality are true. Hence, the ESC advised the 
Commission to continue to follow the MP as formulated but, as a matter of urgency, to 
take steps to quantify all sources of unaccounted SBT mortality. If substantial levels of 
unaccounted mortality are confirmed, the ESC noted that there will be a need to retune 
the Management Procedure to achieve the COMMISSION’s stated rebuilding 
4 
objective. In addition, the ESC advised that the EC take steps to ensure adherence to 
its TACs. 
Strategic issues 
This section highlights strategic issues facing the Commission that this plan will seek 
to address. These issues have been identified recently through a performance review; 
and through an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats 
(SWOT) facing the Commission (see page 9). This SWOT analysis helped highlight 
any other areas outside the performance review that might help the Commission in 
developing its strategic plan (see below).   
Performance review 
In 2008, a Performance Review Working Group made up of representatives from the 
Commission undertook a self-assessment of the Commission’s performance, using the 
criteria adopted at the 2006 Joint Meeting of the five Tuna RFMOs in Kobe, Japan. An 
independent expert, United States Ambassador David Balton, reviewed the self-
assessment. 
The second Performance Review of the CCSBT was undertaken by Dr. Serge. M. 
Garcia, Chair of the IUCN Fisheries Expert Group, and Ms. Holly Koehler, Vice 
President for Policy and Outreach at the International Seafood Sustainability 
Foundation (ISSF). The review assessed the progress made by the CCSBT since the 
first assessment, and its present performance against the best available international 
standards. This approach resulted in extensive recommendations which are shown in 
Appendix 1. 
 
Key challenges 
Taking into account the wide range of recommendations made by the performance 
reviews of the CCSBT, and the other strategic issues identified above, key challenges 
include: 
• Providing for the rebuild of the SBT fishery to the level that can sustain maximum 
sustainable yields (stock re-building); 
• Balancing the competing demands of those who harvest SBT against the 
biological demands of stock rebuilding (TAC setting and allocation);   
• Ensuring all SBT mortalities are accounted for within national allocations, and 
unreported catches are prevented (compliance);  
• Ensuring that all countries with an interest in SBT fisheries are cooperating with 
the Commission; and 
• Ensuring CCSBT’s systems and processes allow for the rights and responsibilities 
of all Members, and encourage cooperation from non-members (governance).  
• Considering the special requirements and capacity building needs of developing 
Members and Cooperating Non-Members in terms of compliance with CCSBT 
obligations. 
 
For the most part, CCSBT has chosen to adopt a decentralised model, where Members 
are responsible for undertaking their own science, administrative and monitoring 
processes (such as running national VMS and observer programmes). Further, due to 
the trans-regional nature of CCSBT, the CCSBT has chosen to apply, where 
appropriate, the rules of other RFMOs in conserving and managing the SBT fisheries 
5 
rather than developing stand-alone rules in a number of instances, for example, in its 
VMS resolution and recommendation on ERS.  For similar reasons and to enable 
shared use of resources, the CCSBT has harmonised some of its decisions (e.g. for 
transhipments) with those of other tuna RFMOs too. 
 
This mode of operation has both potential advantages (reduced Commission costs, 
flexibility of organisation to respond to changing circumstances), and potential 
disadvantages (such as unclear allocation of costs for some programmes such as 
scientific research, and difficulties in gaining agreement for larger-scale undertakings 
that need the cooperation of all Members). Where implementation of many important 
functions is devolved to Members (rather than being undertaken centrally or by shared 
service-providers, as in some other RFMOs), there is a much stronger need for clear 
roles, responsibilities, and performance standards to be set so that expectations on all 
Members are clear. This strategic plan, along with associated documents such as a 
management plan, compliance policy, and potentially a research plan, provide the 
opportunity to do so.  
 
The CCSBT Convention was adopted in 1994, and as such it predates some more 
recent international agreements that set modern principles and/or standards for 
fisheries management, including the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA). 
Key principles of UNFSA include: 
 
• Establishing general principles, including inter-alia precautionary approach, 
ecosystem-based management, and best scientific information available, for the 
conservation and management of the subject stocks.  
• Requiring the application of the precautionary approach to fisheries 
conservation and management—calling on States to be more cautious when 
information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate.  
• Requiring compatibility between conservation and management measures 
adopted for areas under national jurisdiction and those established in the 
adjacent high seas, so as to ensure conservation and management of fish stocks 
in their entirety.  
• Strengthening the role of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations and 
arrangements.  
• Strengthening the responsibility of flag States over fishing vessels flying their 
flag on the high seas.  
• Ensuring effective mechanisms for compliance and enforcement of 
international conservation and management measures.  
• Recognising the special requirements of developing countries in relation to 
conservation and management.  
• Providing mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes between States 
Parties. 
 
Ensuring CCSBT’s decision making practices are fit for purpose, noting that newer 
RFMOs established after UNFSA have adopted alternative decision making 
mechanisms. 
 
The CCSBT Convention was developed without consideration of the potential for 
developing State Member participation.

taking into account the coordination and harmonisation with other RFMOs 
(ii) Coordination and harmonisation with area-based RFMOs, including on data reporting 
(see above) 
(iii) Develop a policy and management strategy for ERS, including consideration of clear 
criteria against which effectiveness could be assessed whilst also addressing safety 
and issues of practicability, under close cooperation with other tuna RFMOs, relevant 
industries and other stakeholders, in order to facilitate the fishing industry’s efforts to 
reduce the risks to ERS. 
4.2 Predator and prey species 
which may affect the condition 
of the SBT stock are 
monitored 
Priority: Medium 
(i) Instruct the ERSWG to monitor predator and prey species which may affect the 
condition of the SBT stock and report its findings to the Commission 
4.3 Improve knowledge of

Key: SA-2008 CCSBT’s 2008 self-assessment of performance; PR-2008 CCSBT’s 2008 Independent Review of 
Performance (undertaken by Ambassador Balton); PR-2014 2014 Independent Review of CCSBT Performance. 
 
Source of 
recommendation 
Original recommendation 
2014 Performance review recommendation  
Conservation and management 
Status of living marine resources 
SA-2008-1 
Support best endeavours of the ESC to 
recreate historical catch and catch per 
unit of effort series for the fishery but 
give maximum priority to accurate 
reporting and validation of future catch 
and effort. 
PR-2014-1: The original recommendation remains valid 
and efforts should continue in the same direction.  
PR-2014-2: The compliance with and efficiency of the 
Data Verification procedures should be regularly 
checked. 
PR-2008-1 
Develop stock assessment 
methodologies that are robust to past 
underreporting. 
PR-2014-3: The CCSBT ESC should undertake from 
time to time (e.g. every 5-6 years) an assessment of the 
robustness of the assessments, e.g. through 
retrospective analysis, comparing past forecasts with 
subsequent realizations. 
PR-2008-2 
Take a precautionary approach to 
management and lower the TAC as the 
uncertainty increases. 
PR-2014-4: The recommendation, in its present form 
might be considered as fulfilled as long as the MP / 
Metarule “tandem” function properly (See PR-2008-3 on 
SBT stock rebuilding strategy). 
PR-2014-5: In the future, the CCSBT could undertake to 
test the robustness of the MP to climate change. It 
should also take every opportunity to give priority to 
stock rebuilding above increasing catch, when 
exceptional positive recruitment spikes occur above the 
variations against which the MP has been tested. 
PR-2008-3: 
Determine management objectives and 
rebuild strategy consistent with UNFSA 
requirements to guide future scientific 
assessments. Set TACs at a level that 
will allow the stock to rebuild. 
PR-2014-6: Every effort should be made to enhance 
(speed-up) the rebuilding trajectory in line with the 
precautionary approach to fisheries (cf. PR-2008-2). 
Special efforts should be made to identify additional 
measures (e.g. protected areas) to support spawning 
and recruitment and improve resilience to fishing and 
climate change. 
SA-2008-2 
Make the maximum effort to implement 
the items which have been identified and 
prioritised by the Extended Scientific 
Committee in the CCSBTs Scientific 
Research Program (Attachment 9 of the 
SC12 Report) 
PR-2014-7: The CCSBT could consider the feasibility of 
a collaborative programme (between RFMOs and 
institutions competent in biodiversity conservation) to 
assess ex ante the likely impacts of climate change on 
the tuna ecosystems, the SBT, the ERS, their 
productivity, distribution and resilience. The outcome of 
this work would indicate which ocean parameters could 
be usefully monitored to better inform the Meta Rule of 
the MP Process. 
SA-2008-3 
Assess and monitor, directly or with 
other RFMOs, the risks and impacts on 
ERS and adopt a mitigation strategy. 
PR-2014-8: The CCSBT should specify the mitigation 
strategies for each ERS, area and fishery with their 
objectives (short and long-term), management and 
enforcement measures, and performance assessment. 
Considering the amount of work this represents, each 
strategy should also specify the order of priority given by 
the CCSBT to the different ERS, areas and fisheries, and 
it should record its rationale for these decisions. 
SA-2008-4 
To base decisions on periodic full 
assessments of the SBT stock and 
establishing a rebuild strategy. 
PR-2014-9: It can be considered that the 
recommendation is being implemented and has been 
integrated in the CCSBT best practice. No more 
recommendation needed. 
16 
Data collection and sharing 
SA-2008-5 
Develop a strategy to collect and share 
data between CCSBT Members and 
RFMOs. 
PR-2014-10: Based on the above the original SA 
recommendation might be considered as completed. 
However the PR suggests maintaining it as a leading title 
under which for more specific recommendations might 
be nested as need arise, e.g. regarding the SBT catches 
in recreational and artisanal fisheries. 
SA-2008-6 
Clear standards are to be set on the type 
of data and level of detail to be provided 
by Members [and cooperating non-
members], in order to ensure the science 
process has the information it requires. 
PR-2014-11: More efforts need to be made to resolve 
the data confidentiality (regarding observers and 
operational fishery data) in order to improve the 
resolution and accuracy of the assessments and 
precision of the scientific advice. 
SA-2008-7 
All members and cooperating non-
members fulfil the UNFSA / Kobe 
requirements regarding collection and 
sharing of data (e.g.: Scientific data; 
Observers’ data; ERS data; Catch 
documentation; Listing of vessels and 
farms; Transhipment; Data gap-filling; 
and data confidentiality (SA-2008). See 
also SA-2008-10. 
PR-2014-12: The initial recommendation, as formulated, 
seems to have accomplished its role and could be 
considered as completed and replaced, in the future by 
more specific ones. 
SA-2008-8 
Commercial confidentiality should no 
longer limit the access to data within the 
CCSBT. Members should make every 
effort to ensure that domestic constraints 
on data provision will not undermine the 
conservation and management efforts by 
CCSBT. Members and Cooperating 
Non-Members fully comply with the 
confidentiality agreements and 
provisions within the CCSBT. 
PR-2014-13: As long as the confidentiality problem will 
hamper the quality of the scientific assessment efforts 
CCSBT should continue to improve the accessibility of 
“confidential” data for this purpose, with appropriate 
safeguards. A time limit should be adopted in the data 
confidentiality rules, putting most if not all data in the 
public domain after a given period of time sufficient to 
reduce sufficiently or eliminate any risk from its broader 
use. 
SAWG-2010 
(Scientific Advice 
Working Group (of 
Kobe II)) 
Range of recommendations on data 
collection and sharing. 
PR-2014-14: It is recommended that the SAWG 
recommendations be carefully examined and integrated 
in the data collection and sharing agenda. 
Quality and provision of scientific advice 
SA-2008-9 
Achieve a better balance between the 
scientific efforts dedicated to SBT on the 
one hand and ERS on the other. 
PR-2014-15: The above recommendation is important 
and is probably a long-term one with implications for 
research but also for management. However, because of 
the subjectivity of the concept of balance and its potential 
financial implications, it should be used as a “chapeau” 
and be complemented by more specific ones, related to 
specific species/areas requiring more attention. 
SA-2008-10 
The current structure of the Extended 
Scientific Committee, especially, the 
independent chairs and advisory panel, 
should be maintained. 
PR-2014-16: No additional recommendation is needed 
regarding the continuing role of the ESC Independent 
Chair and Panel 
SA-2008-11 
In light of the requirement to focus on 
future information with which to assess 
the stock status of SBT, the number and 
skill sets of independent experts required 
in support of the scientific process 
should be reviewed. 
PR-2014-17: Assess the eventual gaps in scientific skills 
and proceed to fill them through recruitment (including of 
new/ complementary profiles in the Independent Panel) 
and capacity building in partner countries. 
SA-2008-12 
The need for a management procedure 
for the fishery in the short term should be 
reconsidered in light of the alternative 
approach of periodic stock assessments 
using the agreed operating model. 
PR-2014-18: The original recommendation should be 
considered as superseded. No new recommendation 
needed as the MP is now integrated in the assessment 
and advisory tool box of the Commission and its 
performance will be regularly assessed. 
17 
Kobe III-1: 
Management 
Strategy Evaluation 
(MSE) 
Contribute to a Joint Technical WG on 
MSE to facilitate the implementation the 
PA (Kobe III p.4 and Annex 3 § 1.3) 
PR-2014-19: The CCSBT should continue to contribute 
to tuna RFMOs effort to develop MSE capacity and 
implementation. As the Joint WG now exists, more 
specific recommendations might be more useful in the 
future. 
SAWG-2010 
- Regular large scale tagging programs 
(including archival tagging) to estimate 
natural mortality growth and movement 
patterns as well as tuna behavior and 
vulnerability. 
PR-2014-20: Large scale tagging programmes do not 
seem to be undertaken anymore which means that the 
recommendation above is not fulfilled. It should be 
maintained or formally rejected by the ESC with an 
explicit rationale. 
SAWG-2010 
- The study of spatial aspects of stock 
assessment to substantiate spatial 
management measures. 
PR-2014-21: Efforts to gain information on the spatial 
structure and movements of the SBT stock and the fleets 
exploiting it should be continued as they are of 
paramount importance for management and 
conservation. 
PR-2014-22: A spatial, ecosystem-based framework 
could be developed as a strategic layer of assessment, 
added to the presently more tactical framework (imposed 
by the knowledge available as well as the need to deliver 
an undifferentiated TAC estimate), to be used every 5-10 
years, perhaps in connection (not in synchrony) with the 
MP 6-yearly performance assessment, for obtaining a 
more realistic foresight. 
SAWG-2010 
- The use of high-resolution spatial 
ecosystem models to better integrate 
biological features of tuna stocks and 
their environment.  
- Agree on a list of minimum standards 
for stock assessment 
PR-2014-23: The recommendation is apparently being 
implemented across various activities. It should probably 
be maintained until a formal document is agreed and 
published on minimal stock assessment standards. 
SAWG-2010 
- Develop research capacity in 
developing Members’ countries 
PR-2014-24: This subject is important for the future of 
the CCSBT decision making progress and legitimacy and 
should be elevated to a continuing recommendation. The 
direct role of CCSBT might be limited (by its funding and 
own capacity to train) but it could help identify needs, 
promote assistance and monitor capacity-building 
activities directly related to the fulfilment of its mandate. 
Bycatch policy and 
management 
strategy 
No specific recommendations  
PR-2014-25: It is recommended to bring together all the 
elements presently related to ERS to elaborate a proper 
policy and management strategy for ERS, adopting clear 
objectives as well as reference values or trends, limits 
and targets, against which performance could be 
assessed. Better use of observers would improve the 
efficiency of the policy. 
Adoption of conservation and management measures 
SA-2008-13 
The CCSBT should continue to make 
conservation and management 
measures which are consistent with 
scientific advice from the Extended 
Scientific Committee. 
PR-2014-26: As a consequence, the recommendation 
above, in its present form, could be considered as being 
implemented correctly. As it seems to have been 
incorporated in the ordinary practice of the EC, it might 
be eliminated from the list and replaced, as appropriate 
with more specific ones in the future. 
SA-2008-14 
The CCSBT should satisfy the UNFSA 
standards. 
PR-2014-27: This recommendation refers to an 
international legal obligation. It could be maintained but 
cannot be usefully assessed unless it is made more 
specific (see next recommendation). New 
recommendations could, for example, call for explicit 
implementation of instruments that further the 
implementation of UNCLOS and UNFSA such as 
International Guidelines and Action Plans for 
management of fishing capacity, control of IUU, 
18 
management of sharks, etc… or the CBD and WSSD 
requirements for Marine Protected Areas (e.g. to protect 
SBT spawners and juveniles or ERS) and other 
international agreements. It could also call for binding 
measures for CCSBT ERS conservation and 
management. 
SA-2008-15 
The parties to the Convention could 
review the Convention and modernise it 
to UNFSA standards. 
PR-2014-28: The CCSBT should formally consider the 
need to align its Convention to the UNFSA principles and 
standards. A gap analysis could be an easy first step 
based on which a decision to proceed with a formal 
revision or through Strategic and management planning 
could be explicitly made. 
SA-2008-16 
The CCSBT should develop a Strategic 
Plan plus a Management Plan to 
implement minimum standards for the 
fishery (SA-2008). 
PR-2014-29: The CCSBT should pursue the effort of 
coherent planning. As conservation and management 
are the core of the CCSBT mandate and the Strategic 
Plan provides a comprehensive framework for fulfilling 
that mandate, it could be suggested to attach to the 
recently adopted Strategic Plan (as an annex) a 
management Plan, going into more implementation 
details. This could help avoid duplication and integrate 
better the policy, the strategy and the management plan. 
The management procedure and metarule processes are 
part of the Management Plan. 
SA-2008-17 
Consider moving to alternative allocation 
principles of the TAC rather than set 
tonnages. 
PR-2014-30: The present practice fulfills the 
recommendation. As long as members and candidate 
members find the present approach convenient, there is 
no reason to change it. 
Kobe-1: 
Ecologically related 
species 
Strengthen conservation and 
management measures to minimize 
harmful impacts of SBT fisheries on non-
target populations and their ecosystems 
and ensure long-term sustainability, 
using the best scientific evidence 
available. In particular: 
Increase attention on sharks, seabirds, 
turtles and mammals (KIII.5.b.f), 
minimizing the impact of fishing (KI.I.10; 
KI.I.11). Assess and manage sharks 
(KI.I.11; KII.1f; KIII.5.b.d). Require the 
use of on-board observers to collect 
discards data (KIII.5.b.a); 
PR-2014-31: There is obviously a trade-off in the use of 
the observers’ time which affects the precision of the 
data (and ensuing assessments) of SBT and ERS 
respectively. Although the detailed data collected 
eventually by observers is not known, a minimal 
assessment of the state of the ERS (or contribution to 
such assessment in a collaborative framework) will 
probably require more ERS data to be collected. The use 
of video cameras might be a useful assistance to the 
observer. 
Kobe-1: 
Ecologically related 
species 
Ensure that [management] measures 
reflect international agreements, tools 
and guidelines to reduce bycatch, 
including the relevant provisions of the 
FAO Code of Conduct, the IPOAs for 
Seabirds and Sharks and the FAO 
guidelines on sea turtles. (BCWG 2010). 
PR-2014-32: The CCSBT relies on its members to 
comply with non-CCSBT institutions requirements and 
the degree of control or verification by CCSBT of the 
effectiveness is not clear and possibly insufficient. 
Formally adopting the relevant FAO IPOAs, adapting 
them to regional plans of Action (RPOAs), and instituting 
an implementation framework would be an efficient way 
to align CCSBT management practices with the 
international standards while strengthening the purely 
voluntary FAO instruments. 
Kobe-1: 
Ecologically related 
species 
Adopt the following principles reflecting 
best practice: bycatch avoidance and 
mitigation measures should be: (1) 
binding, (2) clear and direct, (3) 
measureable, (4) science-based, (5) 
ecosystem-based, (6) ecologically 
efficient (reduces the mortality of 
bycatch), (7) practical and safe, (8) 
economically efficient, (9) holistic, (10) 
PR-2014-33: The real extent of the problem (if any) in 
relation of turtles and mammals should be transparently 
assessed by the ERSWG. The overall policy in relation 
to ERS, summarized in the Strategic Plan, provides the 
higher level frame for the ERS part of a future 
management plan. 
PR-2014-34: As mentioned in the PR-2008, the most 
effective way to reduce collateral impacts on ERS is 
through binding measures implemented by members and 
19 
collaboratively developed with industry 
and stakeholders, and (11) fully 
implemented. 
cooperating non-members and the duty to do so is 
established through the commitments made by 
governments in other fora to use the CCSBT and other 
RFMOs for just such purposes. The commitments are 
referred to also in the Kobe criteria a, h, and i. 
PR-2008-4 
Apply the precautionary approach as set 
forth in UNFSA Article 6 and the Code of 
Conduct for Responsible Fisheries 
Article 7.5, including the application of 
precautionary reference points (PR-
2008; Kobe I, § I.I.4 and 1.10). 
PR-2014-35: This generic recommendation has very 
long-term implementation implications and could be 
considered as being implemented continuously as long 
as a precautionary MP is used together with the 
metarule. If formally adopted as a Principle (possibly 
inserted in a revised Convention), it would not need to be 
carried forward as a recommendation. 
Kobe-2: the 
ecosystem 
approach 
Apply the Ecosystem Approach to 
Fisheries (EAF) to manage bycatch of 
target and non-target species (Kobe I, 
§I.4, §.I.10); 
PR-2014-36: Consider the present elements of the 
CCSBT fishery policy and management framework which 
belong to an EAF. Identify possible gaps, discuss them, 
and move to fill them. Assess explicitly the compliance 
with the agreed EAF framework. 
Kobe-3: rebuilding 
plans 
Adopt and implement effective rebuilding 
plans for depleted or overfished stocks 
(Kobe I § 1.4); 
PR.2014-35: As it stands the original recommendation is 
largely completed with the adoption of a Management 
procedure and a Strategic Plan. However, the 
effectiveness of the rebuilding strategy and plans needs 
to be regularly checked for performance. 
Capacity management 
PR-2008-5 
The CCSBT should at very least 
implement the recommendations set 
forth in the FAO International Plan of 
Action on the management of fishing 
capacity. 
PR-2014-37: As a minimum, the CCSBT should continue 
to monitor the list of vessels (authorized and IUU) and 
develop indices of capacity (e.g. number of vessels as 
corrected by size, tonnage and technology) to ascertain 
that capacity is adjusted to the stock’s biological 
productivity (and hence to the TAC). 
PR-2014-38: If the stock builds up, the TAC will increase 
and higher capacity will be needed to take it. As CCSBT 
plans to assess the MSY (or MEY) replacement yield, it 
should simultaneously project the capacity it will need, 
compare it to the present one and act accordingly. 
PR-2014-39: A longer-term proposition might be to seek 
agreement of other tuna RFMOs for a coordinated 
regional management of tuna fleets capacity to connect 
to the Global Register of ATVs. 
Compatibility of management measures 
SA-2008-18 
The CCSBT’s arrangements in relation 
to catch limits and national allocations 
are compatible between high seas and in 
areas under national jurisdiction. The 
CCSBT should continue to ensure that 
measures are compatible. 
PR-2014-40. Because of the central importance of 
spawning and recruitment for stock rebuilding, additional 
efforts should be made to develop, in Indonesian waters, 
spatio-temporal restrictions, equitable and compatible 
with the rest of the management strategy. 
Fishing allocations and opportunities 
SA-2008-19 
The CCSBT should improve its 
accountability for decision making and 
move towards separating the TAC 
decision from allocation decisions… the 
CCSBT should consider moving to 
national allocations based on alternative 
principles, rather than set tonnages. 
PR-2014-41: This recommendation has been completed 
and the required separation between the TAC 
determination and the national allocations is now 
institutionalized and part of the normal practice of the 
CCSBT. 
20 
Compliance and enforcement 
Flag State duties 
SA-2008-20 
All members and cooperating non-
members should continue to take all 
necessary actions to ensure compliance 
with conservation and management 
measures adopted by the CCSBT. There 
is now an urgent need for CCSBT to 
finalise longer term MCS arrangements 
centred on harmonised arrangements 
under a CDS. 
PR-2014-42: The CCSBT should continue to ensure 
compliance by all possible means, including through 
continued, and full implementation of the enhanced 
Compliance Committee process, QAR program and 
compliance action plans and policies. Any additional 
recommendations on compliance that stem from these 
new processes should be specific and lead to action by 
the CCSBT in accordance with the rules and procedures 
of the Compliance Committee and related Compliance 
Action Plan and tools. No additional recommendations 
are necessary. 
Port State measures 
SA-2008-21 
Bearing in mind the need to avoid 
duplication of effort, the [outcome of the] 
FAO Technical Consultation on Port 
State Measures that was held in Rome 
on 23-27 June 2008, provides the 
Commission with some guidance on a 
preferred model when considering 
implementation of any CCSBT Port State 
measure. That new agreement may not 
enter into force for several years. In the 
meantime, the CCSBT should move to 
adopt a broader set of Port State 
Measures designed to prevent the 
landing and transshipment of illegal, 
unreported and unregulated SBT 
catches – including by vessels on the 
CCSBT authorized vessel list. 
PR-20014-41: The CCSBT should accelerate its 
progress in developing a Resolution on Port State 
Measures consistent with the 2009 FAO Port States 
Agreement. 
Monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) 
SA-2008-22 
As the CCSBT does not have its 
Convention area and SBT migrates into 
the other tuna RFMOs’ areas of 
jurisdiction, the CCSBT should 
cooperate with the other tuna RFMOs to 
optimise harmonisation; improve global 
effectiveness; and avoid duplication of 
work. The CCSBT should prioritise the 
development of MCS in the context of a 
compliance plan. 
PR-2014-43: Considering that both technology and sister 
RFMOs programmes keep evolving, the CCSBT should 
continue to improve its MCS measures and scheme, and 
take additional steps to harmonize its MCS measures 
with other RFMOs. Details on areas to harmonize further 
are examined below. 
SA-2008-23 
Acknowledging the 2007 Kobe 
commitment to consistent ROP 
standards, the CCSBT should align its 
observer program with those of other 
RFMOs which also have an observer 
program such as CCAMLR and the 
IOTC. 
PR-2014-44: The CCSBT should accelerate its efforts to 
strengthen its Scientific Observer Standards and ensure 
they are harmonized with those of neighboring RFMOs 
with respect to ERS observer data. The CCSBT should 
also give serious consideration to the development of a 
ROP, perhaps through forging a relationship with the 
WCPFC to allow for mutual recognition or cross 
endorsement of observers, as the WCPFC and IATTC 
have done. 
PR-2008-6 
A VMS that is not centralised has limited 
effectiveness and CCAMLR has adopted 
a centralised VMS (SA-2008). Although 
most CCSBT members require their 
vessels to use satellite-based vessel 
PR-2014-45: The CCSBT should trigger paragraph 5 of 
its 2008 CCSBT Resolution and goal 8.3 of its 
Compliance Action Plan, and review and revise the 
Resolution to include specific baseline operational VMS 
standards for SBT vessels regardless of their area of 
21 
monitoring systems (VMS) and despite 
the adoption in 2006 of a CCSBT 
resolution committing members and 
cooperating non-members to adopt an 
integrated VMS system, the CCSBT still 
does not have such a system in place. 
The Commission should institute one 
promptly. 
operation, such as reporting frequencies, recipients and 
use of VMS data (such as by the CCSBT Secretariat, 
SC/ESC, and ERSWG and Compliance Committees 
(other than summary reports currently required under the 
2008 Resolution). For instance, CCSBT members and 
CNMs could agree that their SBT vessels operating in 
other RFMO Convention Areas would transmit the VMS 
reports sent under those VMS programs to the CCSBT 
Secretariat. 
Transhipment at 
sea 
No specific recommendations 
PR-2014-46: The CCSBT should accelerate its progress 
in reviewing its Transshipment Program for tuna longline 
vessels in conjunction with the development of a Port 
State measures resolution that is consistent with the 
2009 FAO Port States Agreement. The CCSBT should 
also be prepared to develop rules to govern at sea 
transshipment involving purse seine vessels that are 
consistent with those adopted by the WCPFC, if at-sea 
transhipment activities involving such vessels begin to be 
utilized in the future. 
High seas boarding 
and inspection 
No specific recommendations 
PR-2014-47: CCSBT should therefore develop as a 
matter of priority procedures for high seas boarding and 
inspection of SBT vessels. 
Follow-up on infringements 
SA-2008-24 
The CCSBT should, as a minimum, 
establish agreed rules on the treatment 
of overcatch (requirement of payback). 
Ideally, the CCSBT should establish a 
range of penalties in relation to all 
conservation measures. 
PR-2014-48: The CCSBT has taken steps since 2008 to 
considerably strengthen its compliance assessment 
processes and tools, including a framework for applying 
a range of penalties for instances of Member and CNM 
non-compliance with CCSBT measures. CCSBT should 
continue to refine these tools and ensue they are 
transparently and fairly implemented when necessary to 
ensure legitimacy and integrity in its system, thereby 
creating an incentive for compliance among members 
and CNMs. 
Cooperative mechanisms to detect and deter non-compliance 
SA-2008-25 
- All Members and Cooperating Non-
Members should submit their national 
reports to the CCSBT. 
- The CCSBT allocate sufficient time to 
the CC and the Extended Commission to 
allow them to complete both routine and 
development work each year. 
PR-2014-49: The CCSBT has taken steps since 2008 to 
considerably strengthen its compliance assessment 
processes and tools, including reworking its Compliance 
Committee terms of reference, giving the Committee 
adequate time to meet, and adopting an IUU Vessel List 
measure. Members and CNMs are cooperating with the 
process, providing their national reports on time and 
submitting themselves to a multilateral review of their 
compliance in the Compliance Committee. The CCSBT 
should continue implement these tools fully and ensure 
non-compliance is transparently and fairly assessed, 
thereby creating an incentive for compliance among 
members and CNMs. The CCSBT should also consider 
mandating that a member who is being considered for a 
sanction under its policies may not participate in the 
decision-making on that issue. 
Market-related measures 
SA-2008-26 
- The CCSBT should thus continue to 
move forward smartly toward the 
adoption and implementation of a full 
Catch documentation system (CDS). 
- The CCSBT should implement a CDS 
as matter of urgency.  
PR-2014-50: The initial recommendations are already 
fairly well implemented. CCSBT should explore all 
available options for tracking the trade of SBT between 
those States that are not members or CNMs, and 
continue to engage in outreach (both from the 
Secretariat and individually as CCSBT members or 
22 
- Pending implementation of a CDS, all 
members and cooperating non-members 
should be required to implement the TIS. 
- The CCSBT should monitor all market 
and port states and encourage 
compliance with CCSBT monitoring and 
trade measures. 
CNMs, such as through diplomatic channels and in 
bilateral contacts) to those non-member nations to 
encourage their participation in and implementation of 
the CCSBT CDS. 
Decision-making, transparency and dispute settlement 
Decision-making and transparency 
SA-2008-27 
Consensus decision making does mean 
that some decision making is delayed 
but the Commission could also consider 
that some day to day operational 
decision making could be devolved to 
the Chair or the Executive Secretary (by 
unanimous decision of the Commission). 
PR-2014-51: As changing the CCSBT decision-making 
model (from unanimous to majority decision-making) 
would require amending the Convention, no specific 
recommendations are offered. However, should the 
CCSBT decide to embark on a process to evaluate and 
modify its Convention provisions – as several other 
RFMOs have done in the last decade (e.g., see NAFO, 
NEAFC, ICCAT and IATTC) and which is noted in the 
CCSBT Strategic Plan- there are a number of alternative 
models for decision-making (currently employed by other 
RFMOs) from which it could choose. 
SA-2008-28 
- As [the rules and procedures on 
observers] are not in keeping with the 
spirit of current international fisheries 
governance frameworks, the CCSBT 
should consider modernizing Rule 3 of 
its rules of procedure. 
- The CCSBT and its members should 
improve openness by better publication 
of the rules for observers. One possible 
option would be to put the information 
about the current arrangements to 
accept observers on the CCSBT 
website. 
PR-2014-52: The present policy and regulations of 
CCSBT regarding observers are now in line with 
international standards and the initial recommendations 
can be considered as fulfilled and dropped. 
Decision-making and dispute settlement 
Kobe-4: dispute 
settlement 
Establish adequate mechanisms for 
dispute settlement. 
PR-2014-53: It is recommended that the CCSBT 
seriously consider developing an alternative approach to 
dispute settlement/conflict resolution to avoid the 
potential for future stalemates that could significantly 
compromise the conservation and management of the 
SBT resource. As noted by the PR-2008, the additional 
dispute settlement rules provided by the UNFSA could 
usefully be used as now all CNMs and members of the 
Extended Commission, except Taiwan, are party to the 
UNFSA. 
International cooperation 
Relationship to cooperating non-members (CNMs) 
Kobe-5: 
Cooperating non-
members 
Extent to which the RFMO facilitates 
cooperation between members and non-
members, including through the adoption 
and implementation of procedures for 
granting cooperating status. 
PR-2014-54: CCSBT has given particular attention to the 
subject of non-members with a view to facilitate their 
participation in the governance process. No particular 
recommendation is therefore needed except to continue 
paying attention to the issue and pursue its efforts 
towards the remaining non-members and potential 
newcomers in the fishery. 
23 
Relationship to non-cooperating non-members  
Kobe-6: Non-
cooperating non-
members 
Members and cooperating non-members 
of CCSBT should share information 
about non-cooperating non-members’ 
vessels fishing on SBT and take 
appropriate measures to deter the 
activities of such vessels. 
PR-2014-55. CCSBT has given particular attention also 
to the subject of non-cooperating non-members with a 
view to deter the activities of their vessels. CCSBT 
should continue its efforts to improve collaboration with 
all the actors in the fishery to continue to strengthen its 
efforts in combating IUU fishing activities and ensure the 
effective implementation of its measures and programs. 
In addition, the development of port State measures in 
line with the FAO Port States Agreement (as is 
discussed in section 4.2.2) could greatly assist in this 
area. 
Cooperation with other RFMOs 
SA-2008-29 
PR-2008 
- There are significant opportunities for 
the CCSBT to work more closely with 
and to harmonise measures with other 
RFMOs, especially with the other tuna- 
RFMOs, and this should be a priority 
area for the CCSBT. 
- The CCSBT should add combating IUU 
fishing activities to the list of crosscutting 
issues affecting all tuna RFMOs, as well 
as monitoring and regulating 
transshipment, particularly given 
CCSBT’s geographical overlap with the 
Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and the 
Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 
Commission.  
PR-2014-56: Given the reliance of the CCSBT, in many 
ways, on cooperative relationships with other RFMOs for 
“harmonizing” with (and using directly) a number of those 
neighbouring RFMOs’ measures, the work called for by 
the Kobe process and its 2010 workshops is particularly 
relevant. The CCSBT should look seriously for 
opportunities to re-invigorate discussions among its 
neighbouring RFMOs to work more closely to implement 
the Kobe recommendations. Key areas of collaboration 
include: more systematic exchange of data and 
information (interoperable databases); additional 
harmonization of measures; conducting more joint 
scientific workshops; increasing coordination of 
compliance work, particularly to combat IUU fishing and 
conserve and manage ERS; large-scale tagging 
programmes; ecosystem approach implementation; large 
scale ecosystem-based modelling; Management 
Strategy Evaluation; harmonisation of MCS systems; 
common formats for assessing compliance (with data 
reporting; infringements, etc.); capacity-building (e.g. 
training courses); and development of common positions 
at IUCN, CITES, CBD, and the UNGA. 
Special requirements of developing States 
SA-2008-30 
No change [in the CCSBT policy 
regarding developing Members and 
CNMs] is necessary. 
PR-2014-57: As is noted it is Strategic Plan, the CCSBT 
should develop a more comprehensive strategy for 
addressing the capacity building needs, particularly with 
regard to compliance with CCSBT obligations, programs, 
and implementing the CDS, of developing State 
members/CNMs. One model to consider is that of the 
IOTC, which conducts compliance “missions” in country 
to assist developing State members in identifying areas 
of deficiency and in developing an action plan to 
improve. 
Financial and administrative issues 
Availability of resources for RFMO activities 
SA-2008-31 
The CCSBT should consider 
establishing a position at the Secretariat 
to: (i) provide policy and management 
advice; (ii) take a more proactive role in 
seeking advice/positions of members; 
and (iii) enhance implementation of the 
Strategic Plan. 
PR-2014-58: This recommendation has been fully 
implemented. 
24 
Financial resources 
No specific recommendations 
PR-2014-59: This, together with the fact that there do not 
seem to be any indication of under-delivery, would 
indicate that resources allocated by Members to the 
Commission are more than sufficient to cover planned 
activities. The resulting systematic carry-over is probably 
an illustration of the Secretariat’s concern with financial 
efficiency. However, systematic carry-over is usually not 
considered good budgetary practice as, in principle, 
unless all funding requests were accepted during the 
budgeting process, the savings indicate that activities 
that were not funded for lack of funds could have been 
undertaken and suffered unnecessarily from the 
decision. Uncertainties are always an issue but if they 
always result in carry-over they may indicate there may 
be room for improved planning (with better risk 
assessment). A more professional advice should be 
given by the Auditor. 
Funding of the 
aerial survey 
No specific recommendations 
The PR-2014 does not have the elements needed to 
propose any recommendation on this subject. 
Efficiency and cost-effectiveness 
SA-2008-32 
The Secretariat should continue to run 
the CCSBT efficiently and effectively. 
PR-2014-60: Considering the values generated and the 
costs supported one might suspect that real “efficiency” 
might be made more by accelerating stock rebuilding 
than reducing administrative and research costs. As a 
consequence, considering that the CCSBT deals with 
one single species and few markets. It might be in a 
better position than other tuna RFMOs to consider 
undertaking at least a preliminary economic analysis of 
implications of its rebuilding strategy (taking into account, 
first, only market values) in order to shed some light on 
the economic implications of the parameters presently 
used for the Management Procedure and the planned 
rebuilding trajectory (still undefined). 
Overall CCSBT performance review process 
FAO review of 
performance 
reviews in RFMOs 
1. Performance Review Panels: Use a 
common approach and criteria but 
maintain flexibility.  
2. Budget: Provide a reasonable and 
appropriate budget for the PR.  
3. Cooperation: If needed call for 
cooperation with other RFMOs to 
enhance the PR. 
4. Role of the Secretariat: Play a 
proactive role, as a resource and a 
participant in the PR.  
5. Role of Members: Should be 
encouraged to provide views/ comments 
on the PR. 
6. Role of other stakeholders: Should be 
encouraged to provide views/comments 
on the PR.  
7. Methodology: Provide maximum 
opportunity for communication among 
the panel members, by one or more 
meetings and or through other means.  
PR-2014-61: Based on the above elements of evidence, 
it appears that the CCSBT has satisfactorily fulfilled the 
criteria established for the RFMOs Performance Review 
process.  
PR-2014-62: If not available yet, It would be useful and 
in line with best administration practices, to keep a 
formal record of all recommendations with related 
metadata (date, subject, achievements, current status, 
etc.). It is therefore recommended to keep such a formal 
central repository of the recommendations emanating 
from the EC and ESC, and also from working groups or 
other processes.  
PR-2014-63: The fact that the Strategic Plan is 
structured along the main Kobe Criteria mean that 
sooner rather than later, the Performance Review could 
become an integral part of the Strategic Plan 
implementation and the Recommendation Repository an 
important part of the implementation dashboard.

4 Threats to SBT are currently being assessed by evaluating the likelihood of other fleets catching SBT and by monitoring trade of SBT.  Further work in these areas is required.  It has been 
assumed that a specific project to assess threats from overcapacity in other fleets is not required, but this needs to be confirmed.

6 The “Medium” priority suggests that this should be conducted in 2018-2019.  However, it would be best to review the parameters of the MP as part of the review of the MP scheduled for 2017.  
Other parts of this work (e.g. ecosystem-based management) might be better scheduled for the next review of the MP (6 years later). 
7 A review of the CCSBT’s decisions in relation to modern fisheries management standards and principles was conducted as part of the 2014 Performance Review of the CCSBT.  It would be 
sensible and efficient to conduct the next review of decisions as part of the next performance review of the CCSBT.

5. Measures Relating to Ecologically Related Species 
5.2 Recommendation on Ecologically Related Species (Recommendation) 
Title: Recommendation to Mitigate the Impact on Ecologically Related Species of Fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna 
Link: http://www.ccsbt.org/userfiles/file/docs_english/operational_resolutions/Recommendation_ERS.pdf 
     (Add the direct links of the relevant IOTC and the WCPFC Resolutions and the ICCAT Recommendations on seabirds.) 
 
At CCSBT 20, Members provided a commitment to adhere to the ERS rules in IOTC, WCPFC and ICCAT Convention areas of the IOTC, WCPFC and 
ICCAT in which their vessels fish for SBT 
5.2 Recommendation on Ecologically Related Species 
Minimum performance requirements 
CCSBT Members are bound to comply with their ERS obligation and commitment under relevant Convention areas of RFMOs to which 
CCSBT Members belong when fishing for SBT in the absence of a binding CCSBT measure. Hence it is useful to have minimum 
performance requirements, as set out below. 
1. Operating systems and processes established to: 
a. comply with measures to protect seabirds set by the IOTC, the WCPFC or the ICCAT; 
 i. when fishing south of 25 degrees South latitude in IOTC or ICCAT areas, or when fishing south of 30 degrees South latitude in WCPFC area, 
ensure that all longline vessels use at least two of the three mitigation measures which are 1) night setting with minimum deck lighting, 2) bird-
scaring lines (tori lines) , and 3) Line weighting. 
  (Specification of the measures should be consistent with those provided by relevant RFMOs.) 
 ii. when fishing in other areas, consider to implement measures described above, as appropriate, consistent with scientific advice. 
b. comply with measures to protect ecologically related species other than sea birds (including sea turtles and sharks) set by the IOTC, the 
WCPFC or the ICCAT when fishing in their Convention areas; 
c. comply with data requirements adopted by the IOTC, the WCPFC or the ICCAT for incidental catch while fishing in their Convention areas; 
and  
d. report data to: 
 i. Extended Commission and Ecologically Related Species Working Group and 
 ii. the IOTC, the WCPFC or the ICCAT where SBT fishing occurs in their Convention areas.
