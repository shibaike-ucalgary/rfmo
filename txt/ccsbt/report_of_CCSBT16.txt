Agenda Item 2. 
Report from the Secretariat 
9.  Members noted the report from the Secretariat (CCSBT-EC/0910/04), and there 
was agreement on the following 3 recommendations in the Secretariat’s paper: 
• Future meetings of the CCSBT and its subsidiary bodies to be paperless; 
• Updating and upgrading the CCSBT website; and 
• Creation of a list of long-term approved Observers to CCSBT meetings. 
2 
10. It was noted that a change to the CCSBT Rules of Procedure was required in 
order to achieve the last change, and the agreed changes along with the list of 
long-term approved Observers are included in Attachment 7 at Annex C and 
Annex D respectively.  
 
Agenda Item 3. 
Finance and Administration 
11. The Executive Secretary provided an outline of the financial matters that the 
meeting would need to consider, including the revised budget for 2009 (CCSBT-
EC/0910/05), and the proposed budget for 2010 (CCSBT-EC/0910/06).  Detailed 
consideration of these papers was referred to the Finance and Administration 
Committee (FAC). 
12. The FAC was convened to consider: 
• the revised budget for 2009; 
• the proposed budget for 2010; and 
• other administration issues. 
13. Australia was nominated to Chair the FAC. 
14. The Chair of the FAC reported on the outcome of the FAC deliberations.  This 
included recommending a revised budget for 2009, a proposed budget for 2010, a 
modification to the Rules of Procedure to allow for a long-term observer status, 
and a list of observers that should be initially provided with this status. 
15. The Extended Commission adopted the report of the FAC and all of its 
recommendations, including the revised budget for 2009 and the proposed budget 
for 2010.  The report of the FAC is at Attachment 7. 
16. Australia advised that this year’s stock assessment and the Management 
Procedure being developed used results from the Great Australian Bight Aerial 
Survey.  The survey costs AU$640,000 each year and is an important component 
of the monitoring of the fishery.  Australia requested that the survey be included 
in the budget of the Extended Commission and be supported by all Members.   
17. The Extended Commission was not able to support funding the survey at the 
present time and noted that monitoring research was also conducted by Japan and 
that some RFMOs have setup voluntary research funds that other Members could 
contribute to. 
 
Agenda Item 4. 
Review of SBT Fisheries 
18. The Meeting agreed that all relevant issues regarding SBT fisheries had been 
discussed by the Compliance Committee (CC) and that no further discussion was 
necessary. 
 
3 
Agenda Item 5. 
Report from the Compliance Committee 
19. The Chair of the CC presented the report of the CC which is at Attachment 8. 
The Extended Commission adopted the report and its recommendations, noting 
that Attachment 6 of the CC report containing a “Draft Resolution to Ensure 
Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures” is only a draft and 
needed further development by the Extended Commission before it would be 
considered for adoption.   
20. The Extended Commission expressed its appreciation to the outgoing Chair, Mr 
Dave Wood, for his efforts in chairing the CC over the past 4 years. 
21. Mr Stan Crothers of New Zealand was nominated and endorsed as the new Chair 
of the CC for the next two year term. 
 
Agenda Item 6. 
Integrated Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) 
System 
22. There were no further MCS issues that needed to be discussed but the CC’s 
proposal to hold an intersessional working group to undertake a risk assessment 
for SBT fisheries including proposing potential additional resolutions on MCS 
was noted.  It was agreed that New Zealand would coordinate the work of this 
group. 
 
Agenda Item 7. 
Monitoring of Japanese wholesale markets and Australian 
SBT farming operations 
7.1. Japanese wholesale markets 
23. Japan provided an update of their market review presented to the Extended 
Scientific Committee (ESC) meeting, and advised that there had been no 
significant changes since then. It noted that with the introduction of the CDS and 
associated tagging system, there would be even better systems available to 
monitor the markets. 
24. The Meeting noted that issues surrounding the Japanese market reviews had been 
considered by the Extended Scientific Committee. 
 
7.2. Australian SBT farming operations 
25. Australia provided an update of its SBT farming operations, noted that this was 
presented to the ESC meeting and advised that there had been no significant 
changes since then. 
 
Agenda Item 8. 
Recreational fisheries 
26. The Extended Commission noted that New Zealand had provided recreational 
catch estimates. 
4 
27. In response to questioning, Australia advised that it had not yet provided 
recreational catch estimates for 2008 as these were not yet available due to a 
delay in analyses and finalisation of the survey data by the relevant Australian 
jurisdictions. The survey report would be available soon. 
 
Agenda Item 9. 
Report of the Ecologically Related Species Working Group 
28. The Chair of the Ecologically Related Species Working Group (ERSWG) 
presented the report of the ERSWG (Attachment 9), noting that the ERSWG 
was unable to provide estimates of total mortality of bycatch species but had 
provided a table of initial observed interactions, and made progress towards other 
ERS related measures. 
29. After some discussion on the timeframe for meetings of the ERSWG, the 
Extended Commission agreed that the next meeting of the ERSWG would be 
held no later than the first half of 2012. 
30. The Meeting noted that in order to continue monitoring the implementation of 
ERS mitigation measures, the CC could consider such matters prior to the next 
ERSWG. 
31. Members welcomed progress made by the Secretariat in developing a relationship 
with CCAMLR, including preparation of a proposed Arrangement between the 
two organisations. Following the Kobe II meeting of all five tuna RFMOs, 
Members agreed that the Secretariat should be asked to continue discussions with 
the CCAMLR secretariat and to initiate similar discussions with the Secretariats 
of the IOTC, WCPFC and ICCAT, with a view to developing arrangements that 
include provisions to avoid duplication, especially with respect to the 
conservation of ecologically related species. 
32. Members further agreed that they would report the extent of compliance with 
such measures to the CC as well as to the relevant other organisation or 
organisations. 
33. The Meeting agreed that Members should be encouraged to annually assess ERS 
impact, and report to the next ERSWG, noting that steps to mitigate and reduce 
the impact were also necessary. 
34. The Meeting further agreed that Members should include in their National 
Reports, a table of observed ERS interactions including mortalities, and methods 
of scaling to produce estimates of total mortality, in the same format as presented 
in Attachment 4 of the ERSWG8 Report. 
35. With these amendments the Extended Commission adopted the report of the 
ERSWG at Attachment 9. 
 
Agenda Item 10. 
Report from the Extended Scientific Committee 
36. The Chair of the ESC presented the report of the ESC which is at Attachment 10. 
5 
37. There was an extensive question and answer session relating to issues arising 
from the report of the ESC, noting that its primary recommendation was to effect 
a meaningful reduction in TAC. 
38. It was agreed that the stock status summary at Attachment 13 of the ESC report 
would remain confidential, and that the public version of the ESC report would 
not contain this attachment. A revised version of the stock status summary for 
provision to FAO and relevant RFMOs is provided at Attachment 11. 
39. With the above provision, the Extended Commission adopted the report of the 
ESC. 
 
Agenda Item 11. 
Report from the Strategy and Fisheries Management 
Working Group 
40. The Chair of the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group (SFMWG) 
presented the report of the SFMWG, which is at Attachment 12. The Extended 
Commission adopted the report. 
41. New Zealand presented a Draft Strategic Plan, as provided to the CC in paper 
CCSBT-CC/0910/10, and advised that the strategic plan should become a key 
future document in providing direction to the Commission. 
42. The Meeting thanked New Zealand for its extensive work on the plan, and noted 
that it covered a broad range of issues in a balanced way. The Meeting agreed 
that further development and consideration of the draft strategic plan would be 
conducted by the next meeting of the SFMWG. 
 
Agenda Item 12. 
Report from the Second Joint Meeting of Tuna RFMOs and 
Course of Actions 
43. The Executive Secretary presented paper CCSBT-EC/0910/15 which considered 
the report from the Second Joint Meeting of Tuna RFMOs (Kobe2) and the 
Course of Actions arising from that meeting, noting that the report contained 10 
proposals for immediate action, and 4 workshops to be scheduled during 2010. 
The Executive Secretary advised that the third Joint Meeting of Tuna RFMOs 
was planned for 2011. 
44. Members agreed that the Kobe process is very important to work toward 
improving harmonisation across all tuna RFMOs, and recommended that the 
Secretariat continue its involvement with the other RFMOs, in particular to 
streamline processes and reduce the overlap in the tasks performed by those 
bodies. 
 
6 
Agenda Item 13. 
Total Allowable Catch and its allocation 
13.1 TAC determination and Allocation 
45. The Meeting agreed that the status of the SBT stock is at a critical stage, and that 
in following advice from the Extended Scientific Committee, a meaningful 
reduction in TAC is necessary in order to recover the stock and work toward 
reaching an interim rebuilding target reference point of 20 percent of the original 
spawning stock as agreed by the SFMWG in 2009. 
46. The European Community advised the Extended Commission that it was seeking 
consideration of the Commission for an increase to its national allocation of the 
TAC, noting that its SBT catch was a small unavoidable bycatch of its fisheries. 
It advised that it followed very strict management measures, and complied with 
the Conservation measures of other RFMOs, as well as CCSBT. The European 
Community noted that even with an overall reduction in TAC, an increase in its 
national allocation would represent a negligible proportion of the TAC. 
47. South Africa advised that it was considering joining the CCSBT as a full Member, 
and it hoped to receive a more equitable national allocation, noting that it was a 
responsible fishing nation, with stringent management and control measures.  
48. Indonesia advised that it was considering requesting an increase to its national 
allocation, noting that the current allocation was provided based on scientific 
advice prior to Indonesia becoming a Member of the CCSBT. The request was 
recorded in the Report of the SFMWG meeting.  Indonesia further noted that 
since becoming a Member, its monitoring and the level of data on SBT fisheries 
continues to improve, enabling a more efficient management of its fishery. 
49. The Extended Commission agreed to a “Resolution on the Total Allowable Catch 
and Future management of Southern Bluefin Tuna”, which is provided at 
Attachment 13.  The Extended Commission also decided, as part of interim 
management measures, to adopt a TAC based on binding allocated catch limits 
for 2010 – 2011 as follows: 
 
 
Nominal catch 
(tonnes) 
Allocated catch 
(tonnes) 
Effective catch 
limit 
Japan 
5665 
2261 (2010 – 2011) 
2261 (2010 – 2011)
Australia 
5665 
4270 (2010 – 2011) 
4015 (2010 – 2011)
New Zealand
1000 
754 (2010 – 2011) 
709 (2010 – 2011) 
Korea 
1140 
859 (2010 – 2011) 
859 (2010 – 2011) 
Taiwan 
1140 
859 (2010 – 2011) 
859 (2010 – 2011) 
Indonesia 
750 
651 (2010 – 2011) 
651 (2010 – 2011) 
 
50. The Extended Commission agreed that each Member shall be bound to the 
allocation in column three above. 
7 
51. Furthermore, to contribute to the rebuilding of the SBT stock, Australia and New 
Zealand will make additional annual voluntary reductions of 255t and 45t 
respectively for 2010 and 2011, as outlined in the effective catch limit (column 4) 
of the above table. 
52. The Extended Commission also agreed, for the purposes of paragraph 2(b) of 
Article 11 of the CCSBT Convention, that the budget shall be divided in 
proportion to the nominal catch in column two above. 
53. The Extended Commission agreed on interim catch allocations for Cooperating 
Non Members for 2010, as follows: 
 
 
Allocated catch (tonnes) 
The Philippines 
45 
South Africa 
40 
European Community 
10 
 
54. The Extended Commission also agreed to start discussion from 2010 Extended 
Commission meeting on quota allocation rules which may be used from 2012 
allocations. 
55. When deciding the quota allocation for 2012 and beyond, the report of the ESC 
shall be fully considered. 
56. South Africa and the European Community expressed concern at the TAC 
decision, noting that this represented a significantly lesser reduction than was 
required to recover the stock status. They felt that the agreed TAC would not in 
all likelihood lead to an overall improvement in stocks of SBT. 
57. Regarding the status quo of the allocations of Cooperating Non-Members, both 
South Africa and the European Community expressed their disappointment that 
requests for increases in their national allocations had not been considered and 
requested greater transparency in future deliberations of TAC and allocation 
thereof. 
58. South Africa objected to its allocation and provided a statement of its position 
relating to its request for an increase in allocation, which is at Attachment 14. 
59. The European Community noted with concern that its request for a small increase 
in TAC of only 5-10t had not been agreed for the second time. It further noted 
that it was a responsible fishing nation, adhering to all conservation measures of 
CCSBT and other relevant RFMOs. 
60. WWF expressed concern in relation to ERS measures and noted that even 
assuming 100% compliance with existing measures, there is likely to still be a 
large number of seabird mortalities, which would be unsustainable in the long 
term. It requested that the Extended Commission put measures into place to 
mitigate seabird bycatch with some urgency. 
61. The Meeting adopted a “Resolution on Action Plans to Ensure Compliance with 
Conservation and Management Measures”, which is at Attachment 15. 
62. The Extended Commission agreed to task the Executive Secretary with 
developing draft rules and other necessary arrangements for the exchange of 
confidential data drawing on precedence from other RFMOs, as relevant for 
8 
consideration by the ESC and the CC at their 2010 meetings.  The EC will 
consider draft rules at its 2010 annual meeting for the provision of data during 
2011 and thereafter. 
 
13.2 Research Mortality Allowance 
63. The Extended Commission considered paper CCSBT-CC/0910/16 and approved 
Japan’s request of 1t of RMA for trolling surveys in Western Australia and 
Australia’s request for 10t of RMA for electronic and genetic tagging of SBT by 
Australia. 
 
Agenda Item 14. 
Cooperating Non-Members 
64. The Executive Secretary presented CCSBT-EC/0910/17, detailing the 
performance of Cooperating Non-Members (CNMs), advising that two of the 
CNMs had exceeded their National Allocation in 2008 by small amounts. He 
noted that the European Community continued to have difficulty in complying 
with CCSBT’s Monthly Catch Reporting requirements, but that it had improved 
its compliance with the Trade Information Scheme. 
65. South Africa advised that in response to its overcatch in both 2007 and 2008, it 
had closed its SBT fishery each year, and that the SBT fishery was very difficult 
to manage due to a relatively low National Allocation of 40t, and the fact that the 
average weight of SBT in the South African fishery is quite high. It further 
advised that it was seeking an increase in its National Allocation. 
66. The European Community advised that its SBT fishery is a bycatch fishery, and it 
unfortunately cannot comply with some CCSBT measures in the same way as 
CCSBT Members because SBT is not the target species. It noted that it has made 
progress in reducing bycatch in recent years, but felt that it could not be reduced 
further, and that it would be requesting an increase in its national allocation. The 
European Community further noted that even if the Extended Commission were 
to effect an overall reduction in TAC, the increase it was requesting was still a 
negligible amount of the TAC. 
67. The European Community advised that it would soon be launching a formal 
application process to seek full membership of CCSBT, and that this would 
address requests made at CCSBT15 by some Members. The Chair welcomed the 
European Community’s application. 
68. The Chair noted that due to a severe Typhoon, the Philippines had been unable to 
attend the meeting. 
69. The Extended Commission endorsed the continuing Cooperating Non-Member 
status of the Philippines, South Africa and the European Community. 
 
Agenda Item 15. 
Relationship with Non-Members 
70. It was noted that the Secretariat would write to China and the United States of 
America, seeking cooperation with the Catch Documentation Scheme. 
9 
 
Agenda Item 16. 
Activities with other organisations 
16.1 
Relationship with CCAMLR 
71. The Executive Secretary presented CCSBT-EC/0910/19 which provided an 
update on intersessional progress on the relationship with The Commission for 
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), and with other 
organisations. This paper included a draft arrangement between CCSBT and 
CCAMLR. 
72. The Meeting noted that the relationship with CCAMLR had been a long standing 
issue that had been underway since 2005, and reaffirmed its commitment to 
formalising an arrangement between the two organisations. 
73. After some discussion on the content of the draft arrangement, the Extended 
Commission agreed that further revision of the arrangement would take place 
intersessionally, with a view to formalising this as soon as practicable. 
 
Agenda Item 17. 
Governance – Role of Chair and Commissioners 
74. The Chair advised that at CCSBT15 there was consideration of appointing a 
Chair and Vice-Chair of the Commission for a 2 year period, with a possibility of 
re-appointment for a further 2 years. 
The Extended Commission agreed to defer a decision on this item until 
CCSBT17. 
 
Agenda Item 18. 
Program of work for 2010 
75. The Extended Commission agreed that a meeting of the Strategy and Fisheries 
Management Working Group would be hosted and Chaired by Japan in April 
2010.  The meeting will further develop the draft strategic plan (Attachment 16), 
SBT rebuilding strategy and provide input to the Management Procedure as 
requested by the Extended Scientific Committee. 
76. The workplan of the Extended Scientific Committee was endorsed, including 
evaluation and further specification an emergency rule.  A New Zealand draft 
workplan (Attachment 17) was used as the basis for indicative timing of 
meetings. 
 
Agenda Item 19. 
Confidentiality of Commission Documents 
77. The Extended Commission noted that with exception of Attachment A of paper 
CCSBT-ESC/0909/04, papers CCSBT-CC/0909/41 and CCSBT-
CC/0910/BGD01, and Attachment 13 of the report of SC14, the reports of 
meetings and documents submitted to the meetings under the jurisdiction of 
CCSBT 16 would be made publicly available. 
10 
78. A request was made by one Member to revisit the issue of confidentiality of 
documents CCSBT-ESC/0909/04, papers CCSBT-CC/0909/41 and CCSBT-
CC/0910/BGD01 and to have full discussion of the confidentiality of these 
documents in the 2010. 
 
Agenda Item 20. 
Other business 
79. The Draft Strategic Plan developed by New Zealand for the Extended 
Commission is provided at Attachment 16.  The plan has yet to be adopted, but 
will be considered at the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group 
Meeting in April 2010. 
80. The Meeting agreed that Japan’s proposed Draft Resolution on an Emergency 
Rule had not been discussed, but would be included at Attachment 18. 
 
Agenda Item 21. 
Close of meeting 
21.1 
Election of Chair and Vice-Chair for the Extended Commission of the

Opening Statement by Australia 
 
Mr Chair, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
Ahnnyung haseyo, good morning. 
 
I would like to thank the Government of the Republic of Korea for hosting the 16th 
annual session of the Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna and, in addition, for selecting such a special location for this important meeting.  
Our hope is that the serene surroundings of this setting will help focus our discussions 
and facilitate the development of a common understanding, and achievement of the 
Commission’s primary objective, that is, the conservation and optimum utilisation of 
southern bluefin tuna. And although this beautiful place, Jeju Island, is known as 
‘Honeymoon Island’, it is with all seriousness that I must say that the 15 year 
honeymoon of the CCSBT is over. 
 
Southern bluefin tuna is one of the most highly valued fish in the oceans.  The fact 
that southern bluefin tuna is good to eat, some would say delicious, has not worked in 
their favour.  This fact, combined with the high price for southern bluefin tuna and its 
bluefin cousins has resulted in overexploitation of these species.  We are experiencing 
a form of the often quoted “tragedy of the commons”.  In the case of southern bluefin 
tuna, it is a commons that spans a large part of the Earth and it will require 
cooperation among nations and fishing entities to reverse this overexploitation. 
 
This year the CCSBT Extended Scientific Committee has completed a new stock 
assessment with some important revisions to the operating model used for these 
assessments.  We believe that this assessment represents an improvement over 
previous assessments due to a range of factors, including the incorporation of new and 
better data, notably the fishery independent aerial survey to estimate juvenile 
abundance carried out by Australia in the Great Australian Bight.  Nevertheless, the 
southern bluefin tuna spawning stock biomass is less than 10% of the spawning 
biomass that would have existed if the stock had not been fished. 
 
This is an unacceptable situation for any fishery from a biological and an economic 
perspective.  This point is clearly identified in the Australian Government Harvest 
Strategy Policy which identifies 20% of the unfished spawning stock biomass as the 
limit reference point, meaning the point below which the stock should not fall.  The 
Harvest Strategy Policy also states that, for a wholly domestic managed fishery, if a 
stock falls below the 20% limit reference point, all targeted fishing for that stock 
should cease and a rebuilding strategy should be developed to rebuild the stock.  
Australia recognises that a globally managed fishery must be managed under different 
rules, but that the Harvest Strategy Policy principles are relevant. 
 
Australia’s Harvest Strategy Policy is consistent with the United Nations Convention 
on the Law of the Sea and the Implementing Agreement on the Conservation and 
Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.  These 
treaties must guide all Members of this Commission. 
 
Southern bluefin tuna has already experienced years of recruitment failure, the four 
years from 1999 to 2002.  At CCSBT13 in 2006 the Commission sought to ensure that 
the stock would not decline below the 2004 spawning biomass in 2014, in anticipation 
of the possible negative impact of these poor recruitment years on the size of the 
spawning stock at that time.  However, we do not have evidence of recovery of the 
spawning stock biomass and further years of poor recruitment are possible. 
 
The Commission must act to reverse this trend and agree to a strategy to rebuild the 
stock. The Extended Scientific Committee has called for “…a meaningful reduction in 
catch…” to allow the stock to rebuild. The Commission has already taken the first 
steps towards rebuilding when the CCSBT Strategy and Fisheries Management 
Working Group agreed to an interim rebuilding target of 20% of the unfished 
spawning stock biomass. The Commission Members must work together and come to 
an agreement to ensure that we can achieve the goal within a reasonable timeframe. 
 
Australia recognises the need to reduce the global total allowable catch of southern 
bluefin tuna. For Australia, such a decision is particularly critical. Although Australia 
is not a so-called ‘fishing nation’, and we are joined in this Commission by Members 
with far larger fishing industries, Australia does have some very important and 
valuable fisheries. Near the top of the list of Australia’s most valuable fisheries is 
southern bluefin tuna, a fishery that is one of our largest in terms of both tonnage and 
value. Also, the fishery is centered on a single community, Port Lincoln, South 
Australia and, as a result, it is of great importance to that community and the region. 
Therefore, Australia expects all Members of the CCSBT to make a contribution to 
rebuilding the southern bluefin tuna stock. 
 
Australia is all too aware that past behaviour and non-compliance with CCSBT 
agreements have played the key role in putting all CCSBT Members in the current 
difficult situation. We also are aware, that, had all Members abided by CCSBT 
decisions regarding national allocations, the southern bluefin stock would have nearly 
achieved, if not achieved, the current interim rebuilding target of 20% of the unfished 
spawning stock biomass by 2006. We remain deeply concerned about compliance 
with national allocations of southern bluefin tuna and the fact that not all Members are 
complying with decisions made by the Commission. As a result, we recognise that 
the global catch of southern bluefin tuna is well above the currently agreed To
Allowable Catch. These overcatches must be eliminated. 
tal 
 
Australia will continue to work with all Members to ensure that effective monitoring, 
control and surveillance measures are in place and that catches are effectively 
controlled. We recognise that the Catch Documentation Scheme, agreed at CCSBT15, 
will play a key role in achieving that aim. Nevertheless, a Catch Documentation 
Scheme cannot be fully effective in eliminating overcatches and illegal catches. 
Verification regimes must be both effective and widespread. Members and Co-
operating non-members, port states and market states must all cooperate to achieve a 
fully effective management regime for southern bluefin tuna.  
 
Finally, and importantly, we must minimize the impacts of fishing on ecologically 
related species. We need to meet not just our responsibilities to our own public, but 
also to the global public. The plight of many seabird species, in particular albatrosses 
and petrels, is well-recognised and the outlook for some species is dire. Further, we 
cannot ignore the impact that fishing has on sharks, sea turtles and other marine 
species and we must take positive steps to reduce these impacts, in accordance with 
our international legal obligations. 
 
Australia looks forward to frank and constructive discussions and to measures decided 
upon at this meeting that will put southern bluefin tuna on a rebuilding trajectory. 
 
Thank you, gamsahabnida.

Opening Statement by the Fishing Entity of Taiwan 
 
 
Distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen, Good morning 
 
On behalf of my delegation, I would like to extend our appreciation to Korea for 
choosing this beautiful Island of Jeju as the venue of our meeting. I would also like to 
welcome the representatives of South Africa, and European Community as 
Cooperating Non-Member.  
 
The very important issue for this meeting is to decide next year’s Total Allowable 
Catch (TAC). After last 3 years’ TAC reduction, from the report of the Extended 
Scientific Committee (ESC) held in September 2009, we have noted that the fisheries 
indicators have shown some upward trends, but there remains concern about low 
spawning stock. The ESC recommends that the Extended Commission effect a 
meaningful reduction in catch below the current TAC.  
 
For the sustainable use of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT), we have to consider how to 
take immediate reduction of allocations among members. Facing the undesirable 
circumstance, we are confident that all members of the Extended Commission can 
make the best decisions on TAC in this meeting to avoid the stock further collapsing.  
 
To ensure the effectiveness of conservation and management measures adopted by the 
Extended Commission of CCSBT, at the 15th annual meeting of CCSBT, the Extended 
Commission has adopted three highest priority compliance measures, Catch 
Documentation Scheme (CDS), Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and Transshipment 
at sea. Among them VMS and Transshipment at sea have entered into force this year 
and CDS is going to be implemented on 1 January 2009. I hope it would be benefit for 
the improvement of data quality and monitoring for national quota after all these 
measures implemented. 
 
Finally, we look forward to working together with all members and co-operating 
non-members in the next couple days in producing fruitful results from the meeting. 
 
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Indonesia 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, observers, ladies and gentlemen. 
 
It is my great pleasure to be here to participate in the 16th annual Meeting of the 
Commission CCSBT, and on behalf of the Indonesia Government, let me first extend my 
sincere appreciation and gratitude to the Korean Government for hosting the current 
session of the Commission meeting in a beautiful island of Jeju.  
 
You may have observed that in this current session, it is the second occasion for Indonesia 
to participate in the meeting as a full member of the Commission after Indonesia has 
become full member in early 2008. We are still struggling to fulfill our obligation in the 
work of the Commission in strengthening the management of southern bluefin tuna, as you 
may also know that our capacity in terms of human and financial resources is still limited. 
You may have seen from our representation in the meeting of the Commission and its 
subsidiary bodies which have been inadequate owing to our limited resources. At this 
time, unfortunately also that we don’t have any representation from the industry. 
Nonetheless, we have tried our best to fulfill our obligation.  
 
Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 
 
With respect to data collection, we are very grateful for the financial support from OFCF 
for which under collaboration with IOTC, WCPFC and CCSBT, a workshop on logbook 
system was organized and held in Jakarta in May 2009. Participants of the workshop not 
only came from the Government representative but also from the industry, as represented 
by ASTUIN (tuna fisheries association) and ATLI (tuna longline fisheries association). 
Despite relatively fast development of Indonesian tuna fisheries in the Indian Ocean, it is 
clear that for Indonesia, we are still in the initial stage of implementing logbook program 
in the fishing industry, a program that should have been started earlier when the fisheries 
was just in the initial stage.  
 
With regard to scientific observer, however, this initiative was started earlier, through the 
cooperation with IOTC under financial support from Australia and Japan. Only through 
implementation of the logbook program we hope to be able to strengthen the CDS system, 
one of our important programs in the Commission for the strengthening of the 
management of southern bluefin tuna.  
 
Current situation indicates that future of southern bluefin tuna fisheries seems not so bright 
and call for cooperative effort among members in controlling fishing effort have been 
echoed in various meetings of the Commission. We are looking forward to working 
together with other members in finding good solution of the problems. 
 
Finally, as a part of Indonesia commitment to support the Commission, we offer for the 
holding of the 18th Annual Meeting of the Commission in 2011 be held in Indonesia. 
  
Thank you.

Opening Statement by Japan  
 
Good morning.   
 
On behalf of the Japanese delegation, I would like to express our sincere thanks to the 
Korean government for hosting this meeting in this beautiful place of Jeju Island.  
Although I am afraid that the meeting will be challenging, we wish to enjoy our stay 
in this place as much as possible.   
 
Now, this year’s Scientific Committee has recommended that we reduce catch of 
Southern bluefin tuna since the stock status is at a critical level. Japan, as a 
responsible fishing country, would like to respect this recommendation by the 
Scientific Committee.   
Fortunately, the Southern bluefin tuna will not be proposed to be listed on Appendices 
to CITES in the next Conference of the Parties to the Convention, but its stock status 
is thought to be  worse than that of Atlantic Northern bluefin tuna, which has been 
proposed to be listed on CITES Appendices. In this situation, we are required to take 
conservation measures based upon the scientific information in this meeting, more 
than ever before.    
In addition, we believe protection of juvenile fish, in order to grow them up to 
spawning stocks, is an important issue as well. We believe that, in case we can not 
reach an agreement during this meeting, all Members should never be allowed to 
continue their SBT fisheries under allocations which are voluntary set by themselves, 
as conducted several years ago. If there is no agreement, Japan has to suspend our 
SBT fisheries and import of SBT in the next fishing season. Japan cannot receive 
blame that the Japanese market consumed the Southern bluefin tuna too much and 
depleted the stocks.  
 
Furthermore, regarding implementation of conservation measures, it was confirmed at 
the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group meeting held in April that all 
the Members have to equally take stringent measures for their monitoring, control and 
surveillance, and verification of their catch report. Japan thinks that, along with 
introduction of CDS, our market can not receive any SBT products which were caught 
without ensuring such measures.  
 
Having such a serious thought, the Japanese delegation has come to Jeju Island. We 
strongly wish to achieve significant achievement this week through constructive 
cooperation with distinguished delegates.   
Thank you.

Opening Statement by New Zealand 
 
Tena koutou, tënä koutou, tënä koutou katoa.  Nga mihi nui ki a koutou 
 
[Greetings, greetings, many greetings to you all]  
 
On behalf of the New Zealand delegation I would like to extend our greetings to the 
Chair, our colleagues from other delegations and to observers at this meeting. 
 
Firstly thank you Chair for your welcome and our thanks also to our hosts for the fine 
venue provided for our deliberations this week. 
 
Mr Chairman in New Zealand’s view it is no exaggeration to suggest that this 
Commission is at a crisis point.  While we look forward to the presentation from the 
Scientific Chair on the outcomes of this year’s assessment of the status of the stock, 
our reading of the Scientific Committee report confirms what we have all known for 
some time.  That is, that the southern bluefin stock is at a critically low level and that 
there is a serious risk of further decline if collectively we do not take strong action to 
prevent this.   
 
That is why we are here.  The purpose of regional fisheries management organisations 
is to provide a framework for their members to cooperate in actions to manage stocks 
for which they have competency.  To date we have failed to achieve the main object 
of the convention under which we operate, that is the conservation and optimum 
utilisation of southern bluefin tuna. We have an obligation to change that situation. In 
our view the scientific advice is unequivocal and now is the time for us to act 
decisively. 
 
Chair, we have some critical matters to decide on at this meeting.  We are required to 
take action to rebuild the southern bluefin tuna stock.  While we have some flexibility 
to consider the implementation timeframe for meaningful catch reductions in order to 
mitigate their impact, we cannot delay initiating comprehensive actions to address the 
scientific advice before us. 
 
Given the critical status of the stock these actions will include measures to ensure that 
our catches remain within the level to be agreed as an outcome of this meeting.  This 
will mean that all members will need to consider the effectiveness of their compliance 
regimes and act to correct any weaknesses in those regimes.  Monitoring, control and 
surveillance measures must remain a priority for this Commission. 
 
 New Zealand has been committed to, and has actively engaged in, the conservation of 
southern bluefin tuna since the 1980s and it is with considerable frustration that we 
find ourselves in a position that we can not realise the full benefits of those actions.  
Having finally achieved resolution of our long standing claim as one of the original 
members of CCSBT, we now face the need to consider restrictions on those interests.   
 
Chair, in closing I have been encouraged by the recognition shown by other members 
of the seriousness of the situation confronting us all.  New Zealand prides itself on 
being a responsible fishing nation and we are committed to the sustainable 
management of fisheries.  We are here to work with other members to that end, but on 
a final note I will add that we will no longer bear a disproportionate share of that 
burden.    
 
Thank you

Opening Statement by Korea 
 
Good Morning. 
Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Observers, Ladies and Gentlemen.  
 
First of all, I welcome all of you to Jeju Island and it is my great pleasure to host this 
16th meeting of the CCSBT.  I also would like to thank the Secretariat for the 
tremendous effort and outstanding work for the preparation of this important meeting. 
 
In this occasion, I would like to explain Korea’s view in line with our Deputy 
Minister’s welcoming remarks presented in the first day of the Compliance 
Committee meeting, which strongly requested the Commission to take a decisive 
action to recover the Southern Bluefin tuna stock.  
 
Last two days, we already had some preliminary discussions on our top agenda: 
setting the global TAC and its allocation. Like other delegates, Korea shares the view 
that the global TAC should be reduced, considering the recommendation of the 
scientific committee meeting, that is, the meaningful reduction of the TAC. 
Furthermore, we, as a legitimate resource management body, need to show our ability 
to manage the SBT properly to the international community. 
 
Korea is willing to share the burden of reduction of the global TAC with other 
members and cooperating-non members on an equitable basis. Given the current 
critical status of the SBT, Korea also thinks that we need a long-term strategic plan to 
recover the stock. 
   
On the other hand, monitoring of the fishing activities and catch flow is an essential 
tool to prevent IUU fishing activities and to contribute to the recovery of the stock. In 
this sense, Korea would like to put a great importance on the faithful implementation 
of the Catch Documentation Scheme which will start from the next year. The CDS 
including tagging scheme, Korea believes, is the strongest catch tracking mechanism 
among those of the RFMOs to secure accuracy of the catch information from the 
catch to the market. Although we set up this system with our best efforts, we may 
meet other problems during the course of the implementation in terms of the 
practicality or harmonization with other similar schemes in other RFMOs. We want to 
keep improving the CDS as one of top priorities for the coming years.  
 
Lastly, I would like to encourage all the participants to enjoy the beautiful scenery of 
Jeju Island, one of the most beautiful places in the world.  
 
Thank you very much.

Opening Statement by European Community 
 
Mr Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
It is a pleasure for the European Community to be present at the Annual Meeting of 
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, and we would like to 
thank Korea for hosting this meeting in the beautiful island of Jeju.  
 
Tuna fishing is a global phenomenon and developing and supporting a general 
governance system through international cooperation at multilateral level is one of the 
EC priories in our external fishery policy. Our presence here is in line with our 
general approach, which aims at making any effort to ensure a coherent policy and 
management action, notably of tuna fisheries, in the different Regional Fisheries 
Management Organisations. We would also like to confirm our continued 
commitment to fulfilling our obligations to CCSBT as well as strengthening this 
RFMO in order to ensure conservation and sustainable management of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna.   
 
As you are aware, the EC does not target Southern Bluefin Tuna in the fisheries in the 
Southern Oceans. However, some Community longline vessels have small 
unavoidable by-catches of Southern Bluefin tuna while undertaking fisheries for 
swordfish and shark in the area. We are doing our utmost to keep those by-catches to 
the minimum. In the past year, the Portuguese fleet undertook, with enormous 
difficulties, successful efforts to limit its by-catches of SBT which currently amount 
to 0. Similarly, the by-catches of the Spanish fleet correspond to a mere 0.05% of the 
total catch. 
 
Nevertheless, despite these improvements and all the efforts deployed by our fleet, the 
European Community has to notice that our catches continue to go beyond the very 
small allocated quota of 10 tonnes and this is technically unavoidable. 
 
In light of this fact, and bearing in mind the discussions we had last year on this 
matter, the EC would like to request the Commission to consider granting the EC a 
modest increase in our cooperation quota, which is indispensable given the nature of 
the Community longline fisheries in this area. 
 
Such an increase would reflect the technical reality of our fleet's activities on the 
fishing grounds, noting the very minimal impact of our fishing activities and catches 
on the overall situation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna stock. We are sure that CCSBT 
Members will understand our position and appreciate the openness and transparency 
of our approach in this context 
 
Finally, I would like to underline that the Community was heartened by last year's 
encouragement from CCSBT Members to extend our participation in CCSBT 
business to full Membership. The EC would very much appreciate becoming full 
Member of this Commission and will shortly launch the formal application procedure.  
 
We look forward to participating in this meeting and hope it will be a productive and 
successful one. 
 
Thank you

Opening Statement by South Africa 
 
South Africa wishes to thank our Korean colleagues for hosting this important, yet 
challenging, meeting in the tranquil and beautiful setting of Jeju Island. We also 
express our gratitude towards the secretariat staff for their tireless work in providing 
the necessary support to this organisation. South Africa is fully aware of the status of 
the southern bluefin tuna resource and we would like to foster closer working 
relationships with our colleagues from Member and Co-operating Non-contracting 
Parties through partnering in the stock rebuilding of this iconic species of the southern 
ocean.  
 
The South African large pelagic longline fishery is new, with the first commercial 
fishing rights allocated in 2005. These are long-term rights with the fishery split 
between 20 swordfish-directed rights and 30 tuna-directed rights. Due to the small 
current quota of 40t, the South African large pelagic longline fishery is forced to catch 
southern bluefin tuna as a by-catch species despite the species straddling the waters of 
South Africa’s EEZ. The current quota is not adequate even if caught as a by-catch 
species for 50% of the fleet, as was demonstrated with the premature closure of the 
South African southern bluefin tuna fishery in 2007 and 2008. This has caused 
immense frustration for the right holders, which were required to release all southern 
bluefin tuna caught once the country quota was filled. 
 
South Africa is now in a position to develop a dedicated longline fishery for southern 
bluefin tuna for the direct benefit of South Africans. In developing this fishery South 
Africa would require a substantial increase in quota. In motivation for such an 
increase in quota we wish to bring the following information to the attention of the 
Commission: 
1) South Africa is a developing coastal state; 
2) South Africa is a range state with southern bluefin tuna migrating through our 
EEZ; 
3) South Africa lies adjacent to one of the most important longline fishing grounds for 
southern bluefin tuna; 
4) It is estimated that approximately 25% of the global TAC is fished in the region of 
South Africa; 
5) South Africa has a good compliance record as is demonstrated at the various 
RFMO’s such as CCSBT, ICCAT, IOTC and CCAMLR; 
6) South Africa has also proven that it is a responsible fishing nation in the manner in 
which it has controlled a small southern bluefin tuna quota, which has proven to be 
extremely challenging;  
7) South Africa is progressive in the management of its large pelagic fishery with the 
implementation of rigorous measures such as, mandatory VMS and daily fishing 
logbooks, monitoring of all landings, extensive observer coverage, prohibition of 
transshipment at sea, minimum size limits, and validation of statistical documents; 
8) South Africa has also made great strides in implementing an Ecosystem Approach 
to Fisheries through self-imposed by-catch limits for sharks and incidental catch 
limits for seabirds. 
9) South Africa is an important port state with approximately 3 000 t of southern 
bluefin passing though our ports annually, hence South Africa has a vital role to 
play in the management of southern bluefin tuna. 
 
It is acknowledged that South Africa is currently only a Co-operating Non-contracting 
Party. However, it is also acknowledged that CCSBT is the most costly RFMO in 
terms of membership fees and with the current quota allocation of 40 t it is not 
economically feasible for South Africa to ratify the CCSBT agreement, and to 
meaningfully participate in the meetings of the organisation. In contrast, with a 
substantial increase in quota South Africa will be able to commit to ratification of the 
CCSBT agreement. The full membership and equitable allocation to South Africa 
would benefit the organisation by assisting in the achievement of its strategic goals 
through: 1)  the submission of good fisheries data; 2) dedicated monitoring of foreign 
vessels landing and transshipping of southern bluefin tuna in South African ports, and; 
3) sharing the economic costs and management challenges of the organisation.  
 
In closing, we trust that the deliberations of quota allocations would be conducted in a 
transparent and equitable manner that would take into account the rights and 
aspirations of developing coastal range states, like South Africa. South Africa is 
seeking a substantial increase in quota in order to rightfully develop its southern 
bluefin tuna longline fishery and to be able to justify the costs of becoming a Member 
Party of CCSBT. We have proven that we are able to effectively manage our fishery, 
and to comply with the management and conservation measures of CCSBT. South 
Africa is confident that as a full Member of the Commission we would play a vital 
role in the rebuilding this iconic tuna species.

Opening Statement by Humane Society International (HSI) 
Humane Society International (HSI) welcomes the opportunity to be present as an 
Observer at the 16th Annual Meeting of the Commission.  
The Report of the Independent Expert for the Performance Review of the CCSBT 
recognised the Commission is ‘confronting very significant challenges and meeting 
them with only limited success’. A significant unmet challenge is the Commission’s 
failure to properly address the impact of its longline fisheries on ecologically related 
species.  
The Report of the Independent Expert also commented that CCSBT has the 
opportunity to reverse years of inaction in fulfilling the second part of the CCSBT’s 
dual mandate to deal with ecologically related species (ERS). 
It is for this reason that HSI has made available as its representative, a leading expert 
on longline fisheries, marine species ecology and ERS mitigation to advantage the 
Commission in fulfilling it’s responsibilities. HSI thanks the Australian SBT Industry 
Association for their financial assistance in this regard. 
HSI acknowledges the Commission made a start in this direction at the Commission 
meeting in 2008 with the adoption of the Recommendation to Mitigate the Impact on 
Ecologically Related Species of Fishing for Southern Bluefin Tuna.  
However, HSI considers it insufficient for the recommendation agreed to last year to 
only recommend that its members and cooperating non-members comply with the 
mitigation measures of other RFMOs when operating within their waters and for the 
Commission not to be willing to take responsibility for new mandatory bycatch 
mitigation measures that will apply to all longline fishing for southern bluefin tuna 
(SBT) wherever it occurs. We also note that, when used in isolation, tori lines are an 
insufficient measure to eliminate seabird bycatch. 
The CCSBT management area overlaps with the distribution of 17 of the world’s 24 
albatross species. It is possibly the Regional Fisheries Management Organisation 
having the most significant impact on this group of birds, the majority of which are 
threatened with extinction. It is estimated that approximately 13,500 seabirds are 
killed in CCSBT fisheries annually, and that 10,000 of these birds are species of 
albatross. The report of this year’s ERS meeting indicates that seabird mortality rates 
are continuing at unacceptably high levels and that members have confirmed these 
mortality rates have occurred while tori lines are in use. 
So HSI welcomes the offer from the New Zealand Government in relation to 
conducting risk assessments for seabirds and sea turtles and urges all members to 
cooperate with this urgent work.  HSI also supports the ERSWG recommendations to 
improve data collection for ERS.  
However, while information is gathered and risk assessments are conducted to refine 
future ERS management, mitigation measures proven to be effective in minimising 
seabird bycatch in other longline fishing operations must be deployed immediately by 
all SBT fishing vessels. For example, the options of night setting and line weighting 
have seen seabird bycatch rates decline dramatically at the Commission for the 
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, so much so that zero seabird 
bycatch is now regularly reported from within the CCAMLR Convention Area. (An 
achievement the CCSBT threatens to undermine by failing to mitigate longline fishing 
impact on the same birds outside the CCAMLR Convention area). 
To reverse the years of inaction, HSI strongly urges CCSBT Members to waste no 
more time in agreeing to the urgent adoption of night setting and line weighting as 
mandatory measures, coupled with other bait protection strategies, during all SBT 
longline fishing operations.  
To address the problem of shark bycatch, HSI recommends the adoption of a non 
retention policy and closures for high risk areas and times. If sharks are to be retained 
then they must not be finned.  We further recommend research and development into 
mitigation measures to prevent the incidental capture of shark species. 
HSI calls for an urgent investigation into the extent of marine turtle bycatch in SBT 
longline fisheries, particularly those operating on the SBT spawning grounds where 
the risk of turtle bycatch is likely to be high.  
Given the ground there is to make up on bycatch mitigation, HSI strongly urges the 
Commission to agree to annual meetings of the Ecologically Related Species Working 
Group. The CCSBT will be judged on its dual mandate to manage both the 
sustainability of fishing for SBT and the impacts on ecologically related species. The 
CCSBT cannot in any way afford to slow efforts on ERS with less frequent meetings 
of the working group. 
HSI has read with concern the revised population estimates for SBT detailed in this 
year’s Scientific Committee report. It is our view that fishing for SBT needs to be 
temporarily suspended until such time that the population has recovered to levels that 
would allow it to be fished at ecologically sustainable levels. Such a pause in fishing 
would provide the Commission with an ideal opportunity to agree to measures that 
would enable the fishery to resume on an ecologically sustainable basis in terms of 
both the target species and ecologically related species. 
HSI thanks members for their attention to these important matters.

Opening Statement by TRAFFIC and WWF 
 
Thank you Mr Chairman. 
 
TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, and WWF the conservation 
organization would like to thank the Commission for the opportunity to participate as 
observers to meetings of the Commission and the Extended Commission.  We look 
forward to contributing to these critical deliberations and to helping to implement 
subsequent decisions.  We earnestly hope and expect that Members will make the 
necessary decisions with the necessary sense of urgency to effectively conserve the 
southern bluefin species of tuna and other ecologically related species, especially 
sharks, seabirds and turtles. 
 
There are many steps still to be taken by this Commission to realize the extent of 
transparent reporting of catch and trade of SBT that is necessary to ensure that Illegal, 
Unreported and Unregulated fishing for SBT, by both Members and non-Members, 
can be eliminated.  Nevertheless, we would like to acknowledge the good progress 
that has been made in introducing a Catch Documentation Scheme, a Vessel 
Monitoring System and Transshipment arrangements.  We consider it important, 
however, that the discussion of the full range of integrated monitoring, control and 
surveillance systems that began at CCSBT 13 is continued.  In particular, we support 
the Compliance Committee recommendation that a risk assessment be conducted 
intersessionally to prioritise action by the Commission, and by Members and non-
Members, on identified urgent compliance gaps. 
 
TRAFFIC and WWF remain deeply concerned about the need for conservation of 
ecologically related species as well as SBT. We are particularly concerned at the lack 
of binding measures for shark conservation including shark catch reporting & 
identification, retention of all sharks on board, and retention of fins naturally attached 
until landed.   
 
We also feel that the Commission needs to take urgent and particular note of the 
implications for CCSBT of relevant global developments such as the Kobe II process 
on a range of critical oceans governance issues.  Of particular note are: 
• The imminent adoption by the FAO Conference of a Port State Control 
Agreement aimed at minimizing IUU fishing which includes a requirement for 
flag state validation, and the desirability of its prompt entry into force; 
• The importance of securing outcomes from the FAO/IMO flag state 
implementation discussions aimed at ensuring flag states meet their UNCLOS 
responsibilities to effectively control vessels, especially fishing vessels; 
• The recent submission of a CITES listing proposal for a tuna species has 
highlighted the view by many in the International Community of the 
complementarity of CITES to RFMO management; 
• The desirability of using the IMO numbering system maintained by 
Lloyds/Fairplay as the unique vessel identifier system for tuna RFMOs and so 
potentially capture the efficiencies available by accessing information already 
supplied by national vessel registers; and 
• The need for MOUs between CCSBT and relevant area-based RFMOs (IOTC, 
CCAMLR and WCPFC) to ensure mandatory application of relevant measures 
adopted by those RFMOs. 
 
Finally, Mr Chairman, TRAFFIC and WWF support the development of the 
management procedure within CCSBT and urge its full implementation as a priority. 
Discussions must focus on promptly returning the SBT population to levels that can 
be considered biologically safe and consistent with the application of the 
precautionary principle.  TRAFFIC and WWF, like many others watching the 
performance of CCSBT, are dismayed by the incredibly poor status of the stock, by 
the lack of an appropriate management response and by the long time for which this 
unacceptable situation has not been addressed.  
 
Given these concerns and the recommendation of the Scientific Committee that the 
Extended Commission agree to a “meaningful” reduction in catch, below the current 
TAC, we consider that a ‘meaningful’ reduction must involve setting a temporary 
TAC of zero, to be reviewed annually, by the Extended Commission.  
 
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

Proceedings of the Finance and Administration Committee  
 
1. 
The Finance and Administration Committee (FAC) considered the revised budget 
for 2009, proposed budget for 2010, Rule 3 on observer status, and the renewal of 
the contract for data entry. 
 
Revised 2009 budget 
2. 
The FAC welcomed the considerable savings achieved by the Secretariat in the 
revised 2009 budget, including further savings of $37K made since the 
distribution of meeting papers.   
3. 
The Finance and Administration Committee recommends that the updated 
revised budget for 2009 (Annex A) be agreed by the Commission.  The revised 
budget predicts a net saving of $216,468 against the budget approved at CCSBT 
15. 
 
Proposed 2010 budget 
4. 
The FAC considered the proposed budget for 2010.   
5. 
The FAC noted that the venue costs for next year’s meetings in Taiwan require a 
$72K increase from last year’s budget, despite the considerable reduction in costs 
already negotiated. 
6. 
Travel costs of the Secretariat and advisory panel for meetings were expected to 
increase substantially due to opportunistic savings made in 2009 that were 
unlikely to be realised in 2010.  Savings from moving to “paperless” meetings 
are to be offset by an increase in translation costs as the Secretariat intends to 
outsource more translation in 2010. 
7. 
The opportunity to save costs by decreasing the membership of the scientific 
panel was discussed with the Chair of the ESC.   
8. 
The Finance and Administration Committee notes that the scientific panel could 
be reduced by one member if the work plan proposed by the ESC is approved by 
the Extended Commission.  The expected savings would be about $24K.  The 
FAC recommends that attendance of the full scientific panel remains in the 
budget although it is noted that attendance of the full panel may not be required. 
9. 
The FAC considered an alternative venue to Seattle (i.e. Canberra) for the 
Operating Model Technical Meeting, but decided against this because the 
meeting costs were estimated to increase by $40K. 
10. The FAC agreed to add one more CCSBT meeting to the proposed 2010 budget, 
as a contingency, as it appeared highly likely from plenary discussions that the 
Commission would require an extra inter-sessional meeting.  The increase in 
budget was $63,179 based on the cost of the 3 day meeting held in Tokyo during 
April 2009, noting that no decision on meeting or location had been made. 
11. Options for the production of education pamphlets in accordance with the recent 
ERS recommendation were considered. 
2 
12. The Finance and Administration Committee recommends that in 2010 the 
Secretariat commence work to update the seabird and shark species identification 
guides and if possible publish these to the CCSBT web site at no additional cost.  
The FAC also recommends that the Secretariat, in conjunction with Members, 
scope and cost the remaining work recommended by the ERSWG, including 
printing the identification pamphlets and producing revised sea bird and shark 
education pamphlets in all Member languages together with developing a 
pamphlet on sea turtles  for consideration at the October 2010 Extended 
Commission meeting.  This recommendation results in a saving of $165K from 
the proposed budget outlined in the meeting papers. 
13. The FAC also encouraged the Secretariat to explore opportunities to use existing 
education material produced by other organisations.  
14. The FAC discussed the aerial survey currently funded by Australia and noted that 
Australia may not fund the survey that is to commence in December 2010. The 
cost of the survey is $640K. The FAC agreed that the issue should be considered 
by the Extended Commission. 
15. The Finance and Administration Committee recommends that the proposed 
Secretariat travel budget be revised such that staff attend the CWP/FIRMS 
meeting in Hobart, the Kobe2 workshop on MCS and catch tracking, a farm 
familiarisation trip for new staff to Port Lincoln and one contingency trip.  The 
revised travel budget is $34,000.   
16. The Finance and Administration Committee recommends that the proposed 
budget for 2010 (Annex B) of $1,755,951 be agreed by the Commission.  The 
required financial contribution of each Member is shown in the income statement 
of the budget for 2010. 
 
Observer list 
17. Changes to Rule 3 for Observers were considered by the FAC and in particular a 
more detailed process for approving and cancelling long-term observer status. 
18. The Finance and Administration Committee recommends that Rule 3 be 
amended as shown in Annex C. 
19. The FAC recommends that long-term observer status applies to the organisations 
listed in Annex D. 
 
Contract renewal for data entry 
20. The FAC considered the renewal of the contract for the provision of data entry 
services, including the Secretariat’s declaration of a potential conflict of interest, 
and noted that it had no concerns with the Secretariat’s proposal.

Annex C 
 
Draft changes to Rules 3 and 11 of the CCSBT Rules of Procedure 
to implement the proposal for a long-term observer status 
 
RULE 3 
 
OBSERVERS 
 
1. 
In accordance with Article 14 of the Convention, the Executive Secretary may, 
with the approval of all the Members, invite the following States, entities or 
organisations to send observers to attend meetings of the Commission: 
 
(a) 
any State or entity not party to the Convention, whose nationals, 
residents  
or fishing vessels harvest southern bluefin tuna, and any coastal State 
through whose exclusive economic or fishery zone southern bluefin 
tuna migrates: and 
 
(b) 
any inter-governmental or, on request, non-governmental organisations  
having special competence concerning southern bluefin tuna or 
competent to contribute to the attainment of the objectives of the 
Convention. 
 
2. 
Except as provided in Rules 3.3 and 3.43.5, the Commission shall determine 
which States, entities, inter-governmental organisations and, on request, non-
governmental organisations referred to in Rule 3.1 shall be invited to send observers 
to attend the next meeting of the Commission at the meeting immediately preceding 
the one to which the invitation shall be extended. 
 
3. 
The Commission may approve long-term observer status to specific States, 
entities, inter-governmental organisations and, on request, non-governmental 
organisations referred to in Rule 3.1.  Approvals by the Commission for long-term 
observer status will specify the types of meetings to which the approvals apply and 
approvals will remain in-force until cancelled by the Commission. Any Member may 
request the cancellation of an approval for long term observer status in writing, 
together with the reasons for the request.  The Executive Secretary will circulate the 
request, together with the accompanying reasons, for information, to Members of the 
Commission and the affected observer. The long term observer status will cease on 
4 
receipt of the above request from any Member.  Such a request may be made 
intersessionally but no later than 60 days before the next meeting of the Commission.  
The Executive Secretary shall maintain the list of all current approvals for long-term 
observer status granted by the Commission and shall issue invitations for observers 
with long-term observer status to attend the specified meetings in accordance with 
Rule 3.7. 
 
34. 
Any non-governmental organisation which has expressed an interest in 
sending observers to attend a meeting of the Commission shall provide the Executive 
Secretary with information explaining the organisation’s competence concerning 
southern bluefin tuna or the organisation’s competence to contribute to the attainment 
of the objectives of the Convention. 
 
45. 
Not less than 50 days before a meeting of the Commission, the Executive 
Secretary shall advise the Members of the names of States, entities and organisations 
that do not have long-term observer status in accordance with Rule 3.3 which have 
expressed an interest in sending observers to attend the next meeting of the 
Commission, and provide the Members with any information received from non-
governmental organisations pursuant to Rule 3.33.4.  The Executive Secretary may 
also suggest to Members the names of States, entities and inter-governmental  
organisations referred to in Rule 3.1 not otherwise invited to attend a meeting of the 
Commission whose attendance at that meeting may facilitate the work of the 
Commission. 
 
56. 
The Commission shall take a decision to extend an invitation to observers on 
the Executive Secretary’s advice or suggestion made under Rule 3.43.5 in accordance 
with Rule 6.5.  If a Member objects to an invitation being extended to particular 
States, entities or organisations to send observers to proceedings of the Commission, 
that  Member shall inform the Executive Secretary in writing of its objection together 
with the reasons for such objection.  The Members shall be informed of any objection 
and any reason given therefor by another Member to extending an invitation to 
particular observers and that objection shall be considered at an early point at the next 
meeting of the Commission.  The Executive Secretary, upon receipt of the notification 
in writing of an objection, shall thereupon advise the State, entity or organisation 
against which the objection has been entered of the objection, by which Member it 
was lodged and the reasons provided therefor. 
 
5 
67. 
The Executive Secretary shall issue invitations with respect to observers to a 
meeting of the Commission not less than 28 days before the date of the opening of the 
meeting.  Recipients of invitations shall be required to advise the Executive Secretary 
in writing at least 14 days before the opening of the meeting of acceptance of the 
invitation and of details of the observers who will attend the meeting. 
 
78. 
Observers may be present at both public and private sessions of the 
Commission.  If a Member of the Commission so requests, the Commission shall 
meet without observers present to decide whether the discussion of a particular 
agenda item shall be restricted to Members.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a 
Member so requests, any session of the Commission concerning the invitation to non-
governmental organisations to send observers to attend meetings of the Commission, 
shall be restricted to Members. 
 
89. 
The Chairman may invite observers to address the Commission unless a 
Member objects.  Observers shall not be entitled to participate in the taking of 
decisions by the Commission and shall not vote. 
 
910. 
Observers may submit documents to the Executive Secretary for distribution

Report on Biology, Stock Status and Management of Southern Bluefin Tuna: 2009 
 
The CCSBT Extended Scientific Committee conducted a review of fisheries 
indicators and updated the estimates of spawning stock biomass using the CCSBT 
operating model during 2009.  In response to indications from a 2006 review of SBT 
data that catches over the past 10 to 20 years may have been substantially under-
reported, a range of alternate past catch scenarios was also explored in 2006, but was 
not updated in 2009.  This report updates description of fisheries and the state of 
stock, and provides fishery and catch information, in the light of these evaluations. 
 
1. Biology 
 
Southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) are found in the southern hemisphere, 
mainly in waters between 30° and 50° S, but only rarely in the eastern Pacific.  The 
only known spawning area is in the Indian Ocean, south-east of Java, Indonesia.  
Spawning takes place from September to April in warm waters south of Java and 
juvenile SBT migrate south down the west coast of Australia.  During the summer 
months (December-April), they tend to congregate near the surface in the coastal 
waters off the southern coast of Australia and spend their winters in deeper, temperate 
oceanic waters.  Results from recaptured conventional and archival tags show that 
young SBT migrate seasonally between the south coast of Australia and the central 
Indian Ocean.  After age 5 SBT are seldom found in nearshore surface waters, and 
their distribution extends over the southern circumpolar area throughout the Pacific, 
Indian and Atlantic Oceans. 
 
SBT can attain a length of over 2m and a weight of over 200kg.  Direct ageing using 
otoliths indicates that a significant number of fish larger than 160cm are older than 25 
years, and the maximum age obtained from otolith readings has been 42 years.  
Analysis of tag returns and otoliths indicate that, in comparison with the 1960s, 
growth rate has increased since about 1980 as the stock has been reduced.  There is 
some uncertainty about the size and age when SBT mature, but available data indicate 
that SBT do not mature younger than 8 years (155cm fork length), and perhaps as old 
as 15 years.  SBT exhibit age-specific natural mortality, with M being higher for 
young fish and lower for old fish, increasing again prior to senescence. 
 
Given that SBT have only one known spawning ground, and that no morphological 
differences have been found between fish from different areas, SBT are considered to 
constitute a single stock for management purposes. 
 
 
2. Description of Fisheries 
 
Reported catches of SBT up to the end of 2008 are shown in Figures 1 - 3.  However, 
as a result of indications in SBT data that there may have been substantial under-
reporting of SBT catches over the past 10 - 20 year period, there is currently 
substantial uncertainty regarding the true levels of total SBT catch over this period.  
Historically, the SBT stock has been exploited for more than 50 years, with total 
 
catches peaking at 81,750t in 1961 (Figures 1 - 3).  Over the period 1952 - 2003, 
79% of the reported catch was taken by longline and 21% using surface gears, 
primarily purse-seine and pole&line (Figure 1).  The proportion of reported catch 
made by surface fishery peaked at 50% in 1982, dropped to 11-12 % in 1992 and 
1993 and increased again to average 35% since 1996 (Figure 1).  The Japanese 
longline fishery (taking a wide age range of fish) recorded its peak catch of 77,927t in 
1961 and the Australian surface fishery catches of young fish peaked at 21,501t in 
1982 (Figure 3).  New Zealand, the Fishing Entity of Taiwan and Indonesia have 
also exploited southern bluefin tuna since the 1970s - 1980s, and Korea started a 
fishery in 1991. 
 
On average 79% of the SBT catch has been made in the Indian Ocean, 17% in the 
Pacific Ocean and 4% in the Atlantic Ocean (Figure 2).  The reported Atlantic Ocean 
catch has varied widely between about 18t and 8,200t since 1968 (Figure 2), 
averaging about 850t over the past two decades.  This variation in catch reflecting 
shifts in longline effort between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.  Fishing in the 
Atlantic occurs primarily off the southern tip of South Africa (Figure 4).  Since 1968, 
the reported Indian Ocean catch has declined from about 45,000t to 10,000t, 
averaging about 21,000t, and the reported Pacific Ocean catch has ranged from about 
800t to 19,000t, averaging about 5700t, over the same periods (although SBT farming 
and market data analyses indicate that these catches may be under-estimated). 
 
 
3. Summary of Stock Status 
 
The SBT operating model used in 2008 was revised as described in the report of the 
Extended Scientific Committee (ESC), and then used to project future stock status 
under different constant annual catches (ESC report, Table 1 and Figures 1 and 3). 
The base case scenario is considered the most probable, but account should also be 
taken of results for the six plausible scenarios (ESC report, Tables 2 and 3 and 
Figures 4 and 5). These scenarios all indicate that the spawning stock biomass 
remains at a very low level: typically about 5% or less of SSB0, which is a little more 
than 15% of SSBMSY. There is no sign of the spawning stock rebuilding. 
  
Recruitments during the last two decades are estimated to be well below the levels 
over 1950-1980. Recruitment in the 1990s fluctuated at a low level without any 
overall trend, but recruitments for 2000 to 2002 were poor. The two following year 
classes were somewhat stronger, though still below the average 1990s level. 
Recruitments since 2005 cannot be estimated precisely as yet. Although some data 
give positive signals, it remains probable that at least some of these year classes were 
as weak as in 2000-2002. As the weak year classes in 2000-2002 move into the 
spawning stock over the next few years, there will be a negative impact on the 
spawning stock biomass.  
 
The median projections under the current TAC (of 11810t) for the base case show a 
decline in spawning stock biomass in the short term (to 2013), and remain below the 
current level in the longer term (to at least 2025) (see ESC report, Table 1 and Figures 
1 and 3).  The same is true for nearly all of the other plausible scenarios considered 
(see ESC report, Tables 2 and 3 and Figure 4). To rebuild the spawning stock and 
 
thereby also reduce the risk in the short term of further poor recruitments, a reduction 
to the current TAC is required (see ESC report, paragraph 106). Projection results for
alternative future TAC levels, along with associated probabilities, are shown 
Tables and Figures, with further details to be found in Attachment 10 of the ESC 
report. 
 
in these 
 
While rebuilding of the spawning stock would almost certainly increase sustainable 
yield, the risks that this rebuilding might be jeopardised by further poor recruitments 
have probably increased since the last assessment. Because the spawning stock 
biomass is very low, it may not provide security against adverse environmental effects 
leading to a few years of poor recruitment. Short-term projections for the spawning 
stock biomass are relatively reliable because the year classes that will shortly join the 
spawning stock have already been observed in the fishery. However, longer term 
projections are more uncertain as they depend on future recruitments whose levels 
have to be determined by use of an estimated stock-recruitment relationship, and so 
should be treated with greater caution in terms of their implications for appropriate 
future catch limits. 
 
4. Current Management Measures 
 
At its Thirteenth annual meeting the CCSBT agreed to a total allowable catch (TAC) 
for 2007-2009 of 11,810 tonnes, which was a TAC reduction of 3,115 tonnes.  This 
TAC was only to be reviewed before 2009 if exceptional circumstances emerge in 
relation to the stock.  The current allocation of the TAC amongst Members and 
Cooperating Non-Members are specified below:- 
 
Members 
The allocations below are fixed to 2011 for Japan and to 2009 for other Members.   
Japan 
3,000 tonnes 
Australia 
5,265 tonnes 
Republic of Korea 
1,140 tonnes 
Fishing Entity of Taiwan 1,140 tonnes 
New Zealand 
420 tonnes 
Indonesia 
750 tonnes 
 
Cooperating Non-Members and Observers 
The allocations amongst Cooperating Non-Members have only been set for 2008. 
Philippines 
45 tonnes 
South Africa 
40 tonnes 
European Community 
10 tonnes 
 
Furthermore, to contribute to the recovery of the SBT stock, Taiwan and the Republic 
of Korea undertook to maintain their actual catch below 1,000 tonnes for a minimum 
of 3 years from 2007.  This will result in a target catch level below 11,530 tonnes. 
 
The Fifteenth annual meeting of the CCSBT reconfirmed CCSBT13’s decision on the 
TAC and its allocation as summarised above. 
 
The CCSBT has implemented a Trade Information Scheme (TIS) for SBT, in which a 
 
CCSBT TIS document must be issued for all exports of SBT.  The scheme also 
requires all Members of the CCSBT to ensure that all imports of SBT are to be 
accompanied by a completed CCSBT TIS Document, endorsed by an authorised 
competent authority in the exporting country, and including details of the name of 
fishing vessel, gear type, area of catch, dates, etc.  Shipments not accompanied by 
this form must be denied entry by Members and Cooperating Non-Members.  
Completed forms are lodged with the CCSBT Secretariat where they are used to 
maintain a database for monitoring catches and trade and for conducting 
reconciliations between exports and imports of SBT.   
 
On 1 July 2004, the CCSBT established a list of fishing vessels over 24 metres in 
length which were approved to fish for SBT.  The list was extended to include all 
vessels, regardless of size, from 1 July 2005.  On 31 December 2008, the CCSBT 
established a list of authorised farms that are approved to operate for farming SBT 
and on 1 April 2009, the CCSBT established a list of carrier vessels that are 
authorised to receive SBT at sea from large scale fishing vessels.  Members and 
Cooperating Non-Members will not allow the trade of SBT caught by fishing vessels 
and farms, or transhipped to carrier vessels that are not on these lists. 
 
The CCSBT has recognised the critical importance of adopting and fully 
implementing at the earliest possible time an integrated package of compliance 
measures that would ensure the elimination of unreported catch and provide accurate 
data as a basis for proper stock assessment.  At its Fifteenth annual meeting, the 
CCSBT adopted resolutions on the following compliance measures, all of which are 
to be implemented on or before 1 January 2010: 
• 
A vessel monitoring system  
• 
A catch documentation scheme; and 
• 
Monitoring of transhipments by large scale fishing vessels. 
 
 
5. Scientific Advice 
 
In the light of the current stock status and concerns, management advice is as follows.  
Positive factors affecting sustainability of future catches are: 
• the reported catch has reduced over recent years;  
• indicators and the assessment suggest that the 2003 and 2004 year classes are 
not as low as the weak 2000, 2001, and 2002 year classes; and 
• indicators of age 4+ SBT have exhibited some recent upward trends. 
 
However, there remain serious sources of concern from new and previous information 
including: 
• a very low spawning stock (about 5% of SSB0 and 15% of SSBMSY); 
• the three poor recruitments from 2000 to 2002, and indications of some further 
poor recruitments after 2004, which will lead to a further decline in spawning 
stock biomass; 
• a general decline in recruitment since about 1970, coincident with declining 
spawning stock sizes; and 
• Current fishing mortality is nearly double FMSY. 
 
 
 
The ESC recommends that the Extended Commission effect a meaningful reduction 
in catch below the current TAC of 11810t. 
 
Noting the Extended Commission’s intent to adopt a Management Procedure (MP) at 
its 2010 annual meeting, and given the high probability that such a MP will require 
catch and effort data as inputs, the ESC recommends that the Extended Commission 
take steps to ensure accurate future catch and effort reporting. 
 
6. Biological State and Trends 
 
Analyses suggest the SBT spawning biomass is at a low fraction of its original 
biomass and well below the 1980 level as well as below the level that could produce 
maximum sustainable yield. Rebuilding the spawning stock biomass would almost 
certainly increase sustainable yield and provide security against unforeseen 
environmental events. Recruitments in the last decade are estimated to be well below 
the levels in the period 1950-1980.

Resolution on the Total Allowable Catch 
and Future Management of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
The Extended Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
Gravely concerned about the current status of the stock and, in particular, the most 
recent stock assessment from the Extended Scientific Committee advising that the 
spawning stock biomass is between 3% and 8% of the original spawning biomass, 
Taking account of the recommendation of the Extended Scientific Committee that the 
Extended Commission effect a meaningful reduction in catch below the current total 
allowable catch of 11,810t, 
Conscious of its obligation to conserve and manage the stock of southern bluefin tuna 
with the aim of its optimum utilisation, 
Mindful of the desirability of allowing the fishing industry time to adjust to immediate 
and sustained reductions in the total allowable catch,  
Determined to rebuild the status of stock to an interim rebuilding target reference 
point of 20% of the original spawning biomass within a reasonable timeframe, 
Noting reductions will need to be sustained for a considerable period of time in order 
to allow the stock to rebuild, 
Recognising the obligations of each Member and Co-operating Non-Member of the 
Extended Commission to take the necessary steps to ensure that the level of catch 
complies with its national allocation and to give effect to the conservation and 
management measures adopted by the Extended Commission, 
In accordance with paragraph 3(a) of Article 8 of the Convention for the Conservation 
of Southern Bluefin Tuna, the Extended Commission decides as follows: 
 
1. The global TAC for the 2010 and 2011 fishing seasons shall be reduced to an 
average level over the two years of 80%1 of the current global TAC. 
2. Accordingly the average global TAC for each of the 2010 and 2011 fishing 
seasons shall be 9449t. 
3. By 15 November 2009, each Member shall provide formal advice to the 
Secretariat regarding how it will split its allocation2 between the 2010 and 
2011 fishing seasons. 
4. The CCSBT Management Procedure (MP) should be finalised in 2010 for 
agreement by the Extended Commission at its annual meeting in 2010. 
5. An emergency rule should be developed as part of the MP for exceptional 
circumstances such as recruitment lower than historically low levels. 
                                                            
1 Each Member’s catch in the first year should be reduced as much as possible and 
Members should endeavor to reduce by at least 10% below current levels 
2 Members’ agreement on national allocations is explained in the report of the 
Extended Commission. 
6. The MP should be implemented in 2011 and be the basis for TAC setting for 
2012 and beyond. 
7. In the event that an MP cannot be finalised by 2012, the Extended 
Commission shall adopt a reduction of the TAC for the 2012 fishing season to 
a level of 5,000t - 6,000t unless the Extended Commission decides otherwise 
based upon the new stock assessment. 
Attachment 14 
 
South Africa’s Intervention pertaining to its allocation of SBT quota 
 
  
South Africa’s request for an increase in quota to 750 t was not considered despite 
Article 8.4 of the Convention which obligates the Commission to consider the request 
of developing coastal range states. The status of the resource is not a valid reason for 
not considering South Africa’s request for an increase in quota as we were not 
responsible for the demise of the resource and therefore should not be punished for it. 
It was further noted that no valid reason was provided by Member Parties for rejecting 
South Africa’s request for an increase in quota. Furthermore, South Africa offered its 
services to strengthen CCSBT by assisting flag states in the management of their 
distant water fleets which land or transship large quantities of SBT in South African 
ports in exchange for a small quota of 340 t, but this was not accepted.   
 
South Africa’s proposed allocation representing < 0.5% of the TAC is not equitable 
and the process in determining the TAC and allocation thereof was not considered 
transparent nor was it in accordance with Article 8.4 of the convention. Hence, South 
Africa cannot accept the proposed allocation of 40 t tabled by this commission due to 
the current development of its longline fishery. South Africa hereby reserves its right 
as a developing coastal range state to implement a self-imposed country quota for the 
development of its longline fishery. We shall continue to implement a self-imposed 
country quota until our rights as a developing coastal range state, and the value we 
can bring to this commission is acknowledged in a meaningful way by this 
commission.  
Attachment 15 
 
Resolution on action plans to ensure compliance with 
Conservation and Management Measures 
 
The Commission resolves that: 
 
1. Each Members or Cooperating Non-Member shall submit to the Secretariat by 
April 1, 2010 an action plan to ensure its compliance with the Commission 
conservation and management measures, in particular its allocation under the 
global quota for southern bluefin tuna.  The action plan shall include a scheme to 
systematically verify catch data of SBT and ERS reported by fishermen.  
 
2. The flag Members and Cooperating Non-Members of pelagic longline vessels    
shall specify in their action plans improvement in at least three areas: port state 
inspection of transshipment of southern bluefin tuna, verification of catch data 
through scientific observers on fishing vessels of coverage of 10 % in terms of 
effort and actual inspection of catches by authorities of those flag Members and 
cooperating Non-Members.  For effective port state inspection, those Members 
and Non-Members should designate foreign ports of transshipment of southern 
bluefin tuna for their vessels, prohibit such transshipment at other foreign ports 
and communicate with those designated port states to share relevant information 
required for effective inspection.  All the above measures should be 
implemented in a manner that will not interfere with legitimate commercial 
transaction of SBT.   
 
3. The Members and Cooperating Non-Members farming southern bluefin tuna shall 
implement in the 2011 fishing season commercial trials of stereo video systems 
for monitoring 10 % of the southern bluefin tuna transferred to their cages and, if 
the systems prove successful, adopt them in the following season as the systems 
for ongoing monitoring.  
 
4. The Extended Commission shall explore the possibility of and if appropriate, 
develop a regional observer program to be applied to all the SBT fishing and 
farming activities. 
 
5. All the Members and Non-members shall submit the reports on implementation 
and results of the action plans in 2010 to the 2010 meeting of the Compliance 
Committee.  
 
Attachment 16 
 
 
Draft Strategic Plan for CCSBT 
 
Purpose 
 
To provide a revised draft strategic plan for the Commission for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna so Members and cooperating non-members can agree on any 
additional changes and adopt the revised plan at the annual meeting of the 
Commission in October 2009. 
 
Background – why a strategic plan? 
 
A strategic plan allows for the development of a common vision of how members 
would like to see the Commission in the future.  Components of that vision might 
include the state of the southern bluefin tuna stock; how the Commission operates to 
effectively manage the stock; and how members are implementing their obligations 
and benefiting from their successful management of the stock.  
 
A strategic plan outlines a desired future state, and specific strategies and tasks 
associated with achieving the desired future state (even if achieving that state is a long 
term goal). The strategic plan will become the basis for the Secretariat and members 
to compile annual operating plans. 
 
A recent review of the Commission’s performance highlighted many areas in which 
performance may be improved.  A strategic plan allows these suggested actions to be 
incorporated, as appropriate, into future work plans.   
 
A draft strategic plan was first circulated for comment on 1 July 2009. This version of 
the plan has been revised to reflect Members’ comments (Japan and Taiwan).  
 
Structure of the plan 
 
Perhaps the most important component of a strategic plan is a common vision for the 
future.  The vision is linked to the overall objective as laid out in the Convention for 
the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna: ensuring, through appropriate 
management, the conservation and optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna.  
 
Goals – the desired future state of the Commission – and strategies – the suggested 
approach to achieving the desired future state – provide greater detail on how the 
overall objective and vision will be achieved, and on the relative priorities. 
 
The recommendations from the performance review, and an analysis of the 
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats the Commission faces in 
achieving the objective outlined in its Convention provide the context for 
development of these goals. 
 
An action plan sets out the proposed timeline for implementing the projects.

1.  Introduction 
A strategic plan for the Commission for the Conservation of Southern 
Bluefin Tuna 
This strategic plan outlines a common vision for how members would like to see the 
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in the future.  
Components of that vision include the state of the southern bluefin tuna stock; how the 
Commission operates to effectively manage the stock; and how members are 
implementing their obligations and benefiting from their successful management of the 
stock.  
 
A strategic plan outlines not only a desired future state, but also specific strategies and 
tasks associated with achieving the desired future state (even if achieving that state is a 
long term goal). The strategic plan will become the basis for the Secretariat and 
members to compile annual operating plans. 
 
A recent review of the Commission’s performance provided many suggestions for 
areas in which performance may be improved.  A strategic plan allows these suggested 
actions to be incorporated, as appropriate, into future work plans.  Suggested actions 
are prioritised so that the overall work plan is achievable.  
 
The Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
Origins  
Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) were heavily fished in the past, with annual catches 
reaching 80,000 tonnes in the early 1960s. Heavy fishing resulted in a significant 
decline in the numbers of mature fish, and the annual catch began to fall rapidly.  
In the mid 1980s it became apparent that a way of limiting catches was needed. To 
enable the SBT stocks to rebuild, the main nations fishing SBT at the time – Australia, 
Japan and New Zealand – began to apply strict quotas to their fishing fleets from 1985.  
On 20 May 1994, the voluntary management arrangement between Australia, Japan 
and New Zealand was formalised when the Convention for the Conservation of 
Southern Bluefin Tuna, which the three countries signed in May 1993, came into force.  
The role of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna 
The objective of the Convention is to ensure, through appropriate management, the 
conservation and optimum utilisation of the global SBT fishery. The Convention 
created the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) and 
describes how it operates and functions. The functions of the CCSBT include— 
• collecting information,  
• deciding on a total allowable catch (TAC) and its allocation,  
• deciding on additional measures including monitoring, control, and 
surveillance (MCS) measures considered necessary in order to achieve 
effective implementation of the Convention,  
• agreeing an annual budget, and  
 
• encouraging accession by other states. 
 
The CCSBT meets annually. The CCSBT has six subsidiary bodies which provide 
advice on their areas of expertise— 
• the Scientific Committee (SC)/Extended Scientific Committee (ESC),  
• Stock Assessment Group (SAG),  
• Ecologically Related Species Working Group (ERSWG),  
• the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group (SFMWG),  
• Compliance Committee (CC),  
• the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC).  
 
A panel of independent scientists attend SC and SAG meetings and are able to provide 
advice directly to the CCSBT if required.  
The Convention also provided for the establishment of the CCSBT Secretariat, which 
supports the running of the Commission.  The Secretariat is based in Canberra, 
Australia. Staff include an Executive Secretary, Deputy Executive Secretary, a Data 
Manager and other support staff.  
Membership of the Commission 
Membership of the CCSBT is only open to States. To facilitate the participation of 
fishing entities, the CCSBT established the extended CCSBT (ECCSBT) and the 
extended scientific committee (ESC) in 2001. Membership of the ECCSBT and the 
ESC includes all parties to the Convention, and fishing entities may also be admitted. 
The fishing entity of Taiwan was admitted in 2002. 
The ECCSBT and the ESC perform the same functions as the CCSBT and the SC 
respectively.  Each member has equal voting rights. Decisions of the ECCSBT that are 
reported to the CCSBT become decisions of the CCSBT unless the CCSBT agrees 
otherwise.  Any decision of the Commission that affects the operation of the ECCSBT 
or the rights, obligations, or status of any individual member within the ECCSBT 
should not be taken without prior due deliberation of that issue by the ECCSBT. 
Currently the ECCSBT consists of six members and three cooperating non-members: 
Members 
• Australia 
• Fishing entity of Taiwan (member of the ECCSBT only) 
• Indonesia 
• Japan 
• New Zealand 
• Republic of Korea 
 
Cooperating Non-Members 
• European Union 
• Philippines 
• South Africa 
The southern bluefin tuna fishery 
Characterisation of the fishery 
 
The primary market for SBT is the Japanese Sashimi market, where premium prices 
can be obtained, largely because of the high fat content of SBT flesh. The total value 
of the SBT global fishery is estimated to be about $AUD1 billion.  
The main methods used for catching SBT are longline fishing and purse seining.  
Longlining involves using long lengths of fishing line with many hooks. The SBT 
caught are mainly frozen at very low temperatures (-60C) and either unloaded at 
intermediate ports and shipped to markets in Japan or unloaded directly at markets in 
Japan.  
Purse seining involves using purse seine nets to enclose schools of SBT. This method 
is currently only used in the Australian SBT fishery.  The enclosed schools of fish are 
towed to waters near the Australian mainland and placed in floating cages anchored to 
the ocean floor. The tuna are fattened for several months and sold direct to Japanese 
markets as frozen or chilled fish.  
Status of the stock 
Southern bluefin tuna are recognised as being at a small fraction of their pre-
exploitation biomass.  The Extended Scientific Committee reported in 2008 that the 
scenarios analysed indicate that spawning stock biomass is still at a very low level 
(generally below 10% of pre-exploitation spawning stock biomass).  This was 
recognised as a level at which recruitment may be at risk of further decline. Further, 
the stock is below the level that could produce maximum sustainable yield, a level that 
is generally recognised internationally as a benchmark for sustainably managing 
fishstocks. The scientific committee also noted that there is no sign of the spawning 
stock biomass rebuilding at present. 
Strategic issues 
This section highlights strategic issues facing the Commission that this plan will seek 
to address. These issues have been identified recently through a performance review; 
the first meeting of the Strategy and Fisheries Management Working Group; and 
through an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) 
facing the Commission.  This SWOT analysis helped highlight any other areas outside 
the performance review that might help the Commission in developing its strategic 
plan (see below).   
In 2008, a Performance Review Working Group made up of representatives from the 
Commission undertook a self assessment of the Commission’s performance, using the 
criteria adopted at the 2006 Joint Meeting of the five Tuna RFMOs in Kobe, Japan. An 
independent expert, United States Ambassador David Balton, reviewed the self 
assessment. 
The 2008 meeting of the CCSBT agreed to various initiatives in order to implement 
recommendations of the performance reviews (see paragraph 41 of the meeting report).  
One important outcome of the performance review was to establish a Strategy and 
Fisheries Management Working Group (SFMWG), to develop a strategic plan for the 
Commission and a fisheries management plan comprising management objectives for 
SBT and ecologically related species, consistent with modern fisheries management 
principles. The Commission tasked the SFMWG with the development of a strategic 
plan, as a way of creating a common vision of where members want the Commission 
to be heading.   
 
Performance review 
The performance review highlighted areas where the Commission is doing well, 
including the inclusion within the Commission as members or cooperating non-
members of virtually all fishing activity for SBT; recent improvements in the 
transparency with which the Commission operates; and the undertaking of the 
Commission’s first performance review. 
The performance review also highlighted a number of areas in which the performance 
of the Commission could improve, as outlined below. The recommendations of the 
performance review working group and the independent expert have been incorporated 
into the goals and strategies described later in the plan.  
 
General 
• 
The CCSBT should examine its Convention, compare it to more modern 
instruments, and seriously consider the need to renegotiate it. Even if it is not 
amended at this time, many of the modern standards for fisheries management 
can be incorporated into the work of the Commission in other ways, including 
through adoption of additional conservation and management measures and an 
updated management procedure.  
• 
A strategic plan and management plan could provide direction and common 
vision, and greatly improve the functioning and performance of the CCSBT. 
 
Conservation and management 
Status of living marine resources 
• 
Determine management objectives and a rebuild strategy consistent with 
UNFSA requirements to guide future scientific assessments. 
• 
Develop the most accurate stock assessment possible in light of uncertainties 
caused by under-reported past catches, then set catches at a level that will allow 
the stock to rebuild, taking into account precautionary principles. 
• 
Develop and implement a strategy to address the impacts of SBT fisheries on 
ecologically related species, including collection and sharing of data between 
CCSBT members and Secretariats of other RFMOs. 
 
Data collection and sharing 
• 
Focus effort on improving data collection and reporting through full and urgent 
implementation of the conservation and management measures adopted by the 
CCSBT at its annual meeting in 2006. 
• 
Pursue opportunities to harmonise data collection and sharing with the other 
four tuna RFMOs. 
• 
Ensure clear standards are set for the level of detail and type of data provided 
by members, so the science process has the information it requires (including 
provision of data that meets UNFSA minimum requirements; commercial 
confidentiality should no longer limit access to data within the CCSBT). 
 
Quality and provision of scientific advice 
• 
Maintain the structure of the Extended Scientific Committee, including the 
independent chairs and advisory panel, but review the number and skill sets of 
independent experts required in support of the scientific process. 
• 
Consider the balance of effort between SBT and ecologically related species. 
 
• 
Adopt and implement measures to minimise pollution, waste, discards or catch 
by lost and abandoned gear. 
 
Adoption of conservation and management measures 
• 
Continue to make conservation and management measures that are consistent 
with scientific advice from the Extended Scientific Committee. 
• 
Develop a strategic plan and management plan to implement minimum 
standards for the fishery. 
 
Capacity management 
• 
Discuss with Indonesia the capacity for temporal and spatial closures in the 
SBT spawning ground. 
• 
Implement the recommendations set forth in the FAO International Plan of 
Action on the management of fishing capacity. 
 
Fishing allocations and opportunities 
• 
Once long term allocations are finalised among members, including the 
CCSBT 1 MoU, consider moving to national allocations based on alternative 
principles, such as proportional allocations, rather than set tonnages. 
 
Compliance and enforcement 
Flag state measures 
• 
All members and cooperating non-members should continue to take all 
necessary actions to ensure compliance with conservation and management 
measures adopted by the CCSBT. 
• 
Institute promptly an integrated VMS system.  
 
Port state measures 
• 
When considering implementation of any port state measure, the CCSBT 
should bear in mind the need to avoid duplication of effort, and consider the 
‘FAO technical consultation on port state measures’.  
• 
Adopt port state measures designed to prevent the landing and transhipment of 
illegal, unreported and unregulated SBT catches – including by vessels on the 
CCSBT authorised vessel list. 
 
Monitoring, control and surveillance 
• 
Cooperate with other tuna RFMOs to optimise harmonisation, improve global 
effectiveness, and avoid duplication of work. 
• 
Prioritise the development of MCS in the context of a compliance plan. 
• 
Develop effective measures relating to transhipment, a regional observer 
programme, and high seas boarding and inspection (as set forth in the UNFSA). 
 
Follow up on infringements 
• 
As a minimum, establish agreed rules on the treatment of overcatch 
(requirement of payback). 
• 
Ideally, establish a range of penalties in relation to all conservation measures.  
 
Cooperative mechanisms to detect and deter non-compliance 
• 
All members and cooperating non-members should submit their national 
reports to the CCSBT. 
 
• 
Allocate sufficient time to the Compliance Committee and the Extended 
Commission to allow them to complete both routine and development work 
each year.  
 
Market related measures 
• 
Implement a CDS as a matter of urgency. 
• 
Pending implementation of a CDS, all members and cooperating non-members 
should be required to implement the TIS. 
• 
Monitor all market and port states and encourage compliance with CCSBT 
monitoring and trade measures. 
 
Decision-making and dispute resolution 
Decision making 
• 
Consider devolving some day to day operational decision making to the Chair 
or the Executive Secretary (by the unanimous decision of the Commission). 
 
Dispute settlement 
• 
Note the dispute settlement rules established under the UNFSA that may make 
it unnecessary to amend the Convention to achieve a compulsory and binding 
regime for the settlement of disputes. 
 
International cooperation 
Transparency 
• 
Improve openness by better publication of the rules for observers (e.g. placing 
information on the CCSBT website). 
• 
Consider revising current rules and procedures for observers, since they appear 
to create an unduly restrictive process that is not in line with other tuna RFMOs 
(or Article 12(2) of the UNFSA). 
 
Cooperation with other RFMOs 
• 
Make working more closely with and harmonising measures with other 
RFMOs a priority area (including on ERS mitigation, impacts of fishing on the 
environment, data collection, and combating IUU fishing). 
 
Financial and administrative issues 
Availability of resources for RFMO activities 
• 
Consider establishing a position at the Secretariat to provide policy and 
fisheries management advice.  
• 
Provide the necessary resources to the Commission to implement agreed 
measures (e.g. the CDS). 
 
Efficiency and cost-effectiveness 
• 
If the CCSBT has not always received full and timely payment of member 
financial contributions, discuss what could be done to prevent the problem in 
the future. 
 
SWOT analysis  
The following SWOT analysis outlines the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and 
Threats that the Commission may face in achieving its objective.  In relation to the 
 
opportunities and threats, these include both potential and actual outcomes that may 
occur. The strategic plan allows strategies to be developed to work towards the 
opportunities while avoiding threats that are identified as high risk.   
The SWOT analysis gives an indication of both internal and external factors that need 
to be addressed in the goals and strategies outlined below.  The strengths, 
opportunities, and threats sections, in particular, have helped identify areas outside the 
scope of the performance review where further effort by the Commission may be 
beneficial.  
 
Key challenges 
Taking into account the wide range of recommendations made by the performance 
reviews of the CCSBT, and the other strategic issues identified above, the following 
key challenges can be identified: 
• To provide for the rebuild of the SBT fishery to the level that can sustain 
maximum sustainable yields (stock re-building); 
• To ensure all catches are accounted for within national allocations, and unreported 
catches are prevented (compliance); and 
• To balance the competing demands of those who harvest SBT against the 
biological demands of stock rebuilding (TAC setting and allocation)   
 
Objective: to ensure, through appropriate management, the conservation and optimum utilisation of southern bluefin tuna

2.  Objective, vision, and goals  
 
This strategic plan sets out the objective of the Commission (as outlined in the 
Convention text).  The plan also establishes a common vision for how members would 
like to see the Commission in the future.  Components of that vision include the state 
of the southern bluefin tuna stock; how the Commission operates to effectively manage 
the stock; and how members are implementing their obligations and benefiting from 
their successful management of the stock. Each of these components is associated with 
specific goals – the desired future state of the Commission – and strategies – the 
suggested approach to achieving the desired future state.

percentage of complete correct documentation accompanying landings 
and export/ domestic sales; certain percentage of inspection) (2009 or 
2010 annual meeting)  
(ii) Develop and implement an MCS strategy 
� 
Assess the necessity of additional MCS measures and/or improvement 
of agreed MCS measures to meet Commission objectives (e.g. 
eliminate unreported catch and have accurate verified data) (at 2010 
annual meeting) 
� 
Identify any gaps between MCS measures in place and any 
improvements or additional measures required 
� 
Develop a plan for implementing any changes needed 
9. Members’ obligations  
9.1 All Members comply 
with rules of CCSBT 
Priority: High 
(i) Routinely audit members’ implementation, enforcement, and compliance with 
conservation and management measures and international obligations as they 
relate to CCSBT (e.g. UN Fishstocks Agreement)  
� 
See above (8.1)  
(ii) Establish fair, transparent and non-discriminatory procedures for penalties 
(e.g. payback of overcatch, quota reduction) and incentives to promote 
compliance 
10. Supporting developing countries 
10.1 Developing country 
members and cooperating 
non-members are able to 
comply with the 
Commission’s management 
measures and other 
requirements  
Priority: Medium 
(i) Develop programme to assist developing countries with Commission 
requirements 
� 
Work with developing country members and cooperating non-members 
to identify areas where assistance would be beneficial to ensure they 
meet obligations under Commission decisions 
� 
Identify ways in which assistance may be provided (e.g. up-skilling, 
secondments, workshops etc) 
� 
Develop and implement a programme to assist developing countries 
with Commission requirements

Strategy and Fisheries 
Management Working Group  
April 2010 
The SFMWG would meet for 4 days, and would focus on:  
• further development of the draft strategic plan provided at the CCSBT16 
meeting; 
• agreement on a rebuild strategy for SBT, including target and rebuild 
timeframe; 
• agreeing management objectives and other parameters for input into 
management procedure, including the target and rebuild timeframe; initial 
specification of the emergency rule; and other items outlined in the ESC 
report: 
- The frequency of TAC changes.   
- Maximum/minimum change in a future TAC allowed from year to 
year once the MP is in place (both up and down).   
- Time lag for implementation of TACs dictated by the MP.

Management Procedure and 
Operating Model Technical 
Meeting (‘Seattle meeting’) 
May/June 2010 
The technical meeting would meet for 5 days to review results of initial MP 
testing, and ensure MPs incorporate Commission objectives as agreed at the 
SFMWG. 
 
Scientific Committee meeting 
September 2010 
The Scientific Committee meeting would finalise MP selection to recommend 
at CCSBT, and would ensure Commissioners have advice on the trade-offs 
involved in alternative MPs, and specification of the emergency rule. 
 
Annual Commission meeting 
October 2010 
Annual Commission meeting will adopt an MP. 
 
2011 
 
 
Scientific Committee meeting 
 
 
It is suggested that the timing of both the Scientific Committee and Annual 
Commission meetings would be brought forward in 2011 to allow sufficient 
time for discussions. 
Annual Commission meeting 
 
 
 
 
*  Noting the advice of the ESC at paragraph 131 of its report that emphasises the importance of ongoing communication between scientists and 
managers in the formulation of options to be considered in the development of MPs.  Given the compressed schedule that is necessary to deliver 
recommendations on MPs by 2010, it will be a challenge to maintain the level of communication that is needed.  Therefore, the ESC strongly 
encourages the Extended Commission to consider how it will engage with the development process for the MP.  Options include  
(a) Commissioners observing scientific sessions during the MP development period,  
(b) organising special sessions where scientists and Commissioners can exchange views on progress in the development of the MP,  
(c) arrangements at the national level for routine communication between managers and scientists on progress in the development of the MP, or 
(d) a combination of these options.

Japanese Proposal 
 
Draft Resolution on Emergency Rule 
 
The Commission resolves that: 
 
(1) The Extended Scientific Committee (ESC) shall annually review a recruitment 
level of that year and report the results to the Commission on a basis of the 
following four sources of information obtained that year: 
a. Aerial survey of SBT in the Great Australian Bite 
b. Trolling survey of small SBT 
c. Observer data of small SBT catch obtained in longline fisheries  
d. Monitored purse seine data of small SBT catch transferred to cages 
 
(2) When the ESC reports that the recruitment level that year is significantly lower 
than the 1999-2002 level, the Commission shall suspend all the fisheries for SBT 
except for artisanal fishery next year.  Members and Cooperating Non-Members 
shall intensify research activities so that the ESC can conduct further analysis on 
the recruitment and present recommendations on conservation and management 
measures. 
 
(3) Based upon the recommendations of the ESC, the Commission shall decide at its 
next year’s meeting appropriate conservation and management measures including 
possible continuation of suspension or steps to resume fisheries for SBT.
