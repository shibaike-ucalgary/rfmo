Introduction 
 
Over the last 20 years, civil society has participated in growing numbers in meetings of 
international environmental organizations, including fisheries commissions, and their subsidiary 
bodies.1 Known as “observers,”2 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) representing business 
interests, environmental interests, human rights, and other interests are recognized as “an integral 
part of the negotiating process.”3 Ten thousand individuals representing hundreds of non-
governmental, intergovernmental, and governmental bodies regularly attend meetings of the 
climate change regime4 and the Convention on Biological Diversity.5 Smaller numbers of 
individuals attend meetings of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of

Another Successful Failure?, in GREEN GLOBE YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION ON ENVIRONMENT 
AND DEVELOPMENT 25–35 (eds. H. Bergesen and G. Parmann, 1993). Raustiala discusses the relative lack of NGO 
participation in multilateral environmental treaties before the 1970s but much greater and more expansive 
participation starting around 1985. Raustiala suggests that the increase in NGO participation over time is, in part, 
due to the increased complexity of new resource regimes which require more implementation and adjustment. Id. at

witnessed a dramatic increase in the involvement of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in global 
governance.”). 
2 The term observer is the phrase applied to any non-party participant in an international meeting. An observer may 
represent a State that is not party to the agreement, an international organization, or a non-governmental 
organization representing any number of different interests.

Transparency in International Agreements (IELP: Nov. 10, 2016) 
 
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES),6 the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS),7 and other 
multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs).  
 
Greater and more expansive NGO participation in MEAs is consistent with Agenda 21,8 the so-
called blueprint for sustainable development. Agenda 21 recognizes that NGOs “possess well-
established and diverse experience, expertise and capacity in fields which will be of particular 
importance to the implementation and review of environmentally sound and socially responsible 
sustainable development.”9 The CITES Parties have also specifically “recognize[ed] the valuable 
contributions of observers.”10 Others report that “[d]ue to their critical role in service delivery 
and implementation,” NGOs have “long been recognized as ‘partners’ of the UN system, 
especially in environmental negotiations.”11 In the fisheries context, the UN Fish Stocks 
Agreement requires States to provide for transparency in the decision-making process and other 
activities of subregional and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements 
(RFMOs) and specifically provides that representatives from intergovernmental organizations 
and NGOs “shall be afforded the opportunity to take part in meetings” of RFMOs.12 Such 
procedures shall not be unduly restrictive in this respect. Such intergovernmental organizations 
and non-governmental organizations shall have timely access to the records and reports of such 
organizations and arrangements, subject to the procedural rules on access to them. 
 
Despite the growing relevance and recognized value of observers in meetings of international 
organizations, some members of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission 
(WCPFC)13 have called for NGO observers to pay extremely high participation fees to attend

Transparency in International Agreements (IELP: Nov. 10, 2016) 
 
WCPFC meetings14 and observers have been excluded from portions of WCPFC meetings. In 
part due to these issues, the WCPFC directed the Secretariat to undertake a review of observer 
participation at the Commission, covering the following possible elements: 1) the number of 
observers which have attended meetings; 2) whether it is appropriate to limit numbers on 
observers’ delegations; 3) whether it is appropriate for observers to pay an annual contribution 
towards the meeting costs; 4) how to accommodate treating separately observers which support 
the effective participation in the Commission by Small Island Developing States; 5) whether 
and/or how to accommodate treating separately observers that are direct stakeholders, such as 
harvest groups; 6) transparency; and 7) access to documents.15 In addition, the International 
Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-Like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC),16 which 
provides scientific and management advice to the WCPFC, recently adopted restrictive rules for 
observer participation. 
 
To complement the Secretariat’s review and to determine whether the proposal for high fees for 
observer participation in the WCPFC, the exclusion of observers from WCPFC-related meetings, 
and the ISC’s restrictive observer participation rules are consistent with trends in international 
law, this report reviews the rules for observer participation in 14 international organizations—
five MEAs, six regional fisheries management organizations (RMFOs), and three International 
Science Organizations (ISOs). The five MEAs are  
 
• 
the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD);  
• 
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and 
Flora (CITES); 
• 
the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) 
• 
the Montreal Protocol on Substances; that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Montreal 
Protocol);17 and 
• 
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).18 
                                                
14 Members of the Forum Fisheries Agency, an alliance of 17 Pacific Island members, many of which participate in 
the WCPFC, have suggested that observers pay a fee of $10,000 to participate in an annual meeting of the WCPFC.

16 In 2013, the ISC adopted a brief Protocol governing the participation of observers with the following elements: 
 
1. Observers must apply at least 60 days in advance of the ISC meeting and a single member may veto an 
observer application without explanation.  
2. Observer participation is restricted to the Plenary session only. 
3. Observers cannot submit documents to the Plenary or associated workshops.  
4. Observer documents will not be posted on the ISC meeting website. 
5. Observers are allotted a single limited period at the end of each day when they may ask technical 
questions about ISC assessments and procedures only; presentations or expressions of positions by 
observers are not permitted.

The six RFMOs are 
 
• 
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT);19 
• 
the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC);20 
• 
the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT);21 
• 
the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC);22 
• 
the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO);23 and 
• 
the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC). 
 
The three ISOs are 
 
• 
the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES);24  
• 
the Intergovernmental Platform on Biological and Ecosystem Services (IPBES);25 and 
• 
the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES).26 
 
Section II begins with an overview of the value of observer participation. Section III summarizes 
the rules for observer participation, including attendance at meetings, document distribution, 
ability to speak, and other aspects of participation. The Annex to this document provides a 
detailed description of the rules for observer participation within the MEAs, RFMOs, and ISOs 
that are summarized in Section III. Based on the review of the rules for observer participation, 
Section IV concludes that excluding observers from meetings and large fees for observer 
participation are inconsistent with current practice. In fact, ICCAT rescinded its $2,000 fee as 
inequitable and inconsistent with transparency. This paper also concludes that the restrictive 
rules for observer participation in ISC meetings are mostly inconsistent with current practice.

II. 
The Value of Observer Participation 
 
NGO observers provide many important benefits to States participating in international 
agreements even if States sometimes view NGOs as oppositional to State power or as 
diminishing State power.27 As one scholar writes, NGO participation “does not come at the 
expense of state centrality; rather it is to the advantage of states.”28 NGOs provide advantages to 
States because they do not necessarily only lobby State Parties to vote a particular way on an 
issue; they perform a variety of valuable functions critical to the international policy-making 
process.29 For example, NGO observers help 1) address scientific, economic, and other 
uncertainties by researching and presenting relevant information to policy makers; 2) organize 
workshops, seminars, and conferences to enhance knowledge intersessionally; 3) share their 
expertise by participating on State delegations; 4) participate in review and enforcement 
procedures; 5) ensure transparency of the decision-making process; 6) provide support to 
convention secretariats; 7) and provide on-the-ground support on relevant issues outside the 
negotiations.30 Regarding on-the-ground support, Greenpeace in 2015 detected a vessel fishing 
within the WCPFC Convention Area that was not registered to fish in the area.31 
 
International policy-making, and in particular international environmental policy-making, is 
typically complex and often entails scientific, economic, and other uncertainties.32 NGOs are in 
an ideal position to help address that uncertainty33 because they hire professionals to research the 
scientific, economic, social, and technical aspects of specific issues; their research may then be 
made available to States.34 NGOs may also disseminate information at intersessional workshops, 
seminars, or conferences.35 That research allows States to minimize their own research expenses 
while maximizing the amount of policy information they obtain.36 This research may be 
particularly valuable to developing countries that lack the resources to conduct their own

33 See Raustiala, supra note 1, at 727. Raustiala further suggests that although NGOs have inherent bias in the 
information presented, those biases are generally known to the governments involved and the governments can 
evaluate and use the data if appropriate. Id. See also Ecologic, supra note 29, at 40–42. Ecologic offers several 
examples of organizations including, World Resources Institute, World Watch Institute, World Conservation 
Monitoring Centre, and International Institute for Sustainable Development that are particularly active in providing 
information to Parties to assist in decision-making. Id. at 41–42.

research.37 For example, at the Basel Convention, NGOs provided documentation on the 
ineffectiveness of the original prior informed consent procedure concerning the transboundary 
movement of hazardous waste.38 Within CITES, NGOs document illegal trade and killing of 
elephants to help Parties determine whether to allow international trade in elephant ivory.39  
 
National delegations also commonly tap NGO expertise by inviting NGO representatives to 
serve on their delegations. They are often tasked with representing the interests of civil society 
even if they have limited ability while on a governmental delegation to lobby on behalf of their 
NGO’s interests.40 Alternatively, NGO representatives may serve as advisers for specific issues. 
Again, those representatives have increased access but their ability to directly lobby for their 
NGO’s position is limited. For example, member States of the Alliance of Small Island States 
(AOSIS) have asked a representative of the International Environmental Law Project to be on 
delegation to provide legal advice at climate change negotiations.41 The United Kingdom has 
invited NGO representatives to participate on the delegations to annual meetings of the 
International Whaling Commission.42  
 
NGOs can also assist in review and enforcement procedures. Although NGOs typically do not 
have a direct role in enforcement proceedings and their participation varies by agreement, several 
agreements, including the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural 
Habitats,43 allow NGOs to initiate a compliance matter44 or participate as a member of the

Parties to the Montreal Protocol information on the illegal trade of ozone-depleting substances or Greenpeace 
International providing information on the illegal trade of hazardous wastes. Id. at 41–42. Not only environmental 
organizations provide information. An industry association, the Alternative Fluorocarbon Environmental 
Acceptability Study, provides Parties to the Montreal Protocol with information on production of ozone-depleting 
substances. Id. at 42.

ensure that the Parties to the Bern Convention actually implement the Convention’s obligations, the Parties 
developed a case-file system which specifically allows NGOs to initiate complaints of violation of the convention.

receives information, the roster of claims clarifies that NGOs are allowed, and have, initiated compliance matters.

compliance committee.45 NGOs can be uniquely positioned to independently monitor and assess 
a State’s compliance with its treaty obligations.46 For example, NGOs have provided reports 
assessing State compliance with pledges made pursuant to various international agreements or 
have tracked wildlife trade in order to evaluate a regime’s progress.47 Scholars have identified 
monitoring by NGOs as a key factor in the effectiveness of an international agreement.48 
 
Transparency is fundamental to the democratic process and can help hold policy makers 
accountable for their decisions.49 NGOs can directly assist during a negotiation by reporting on 
the daily events at a meeting. This reporting not only allows transparency of the negotiations but 
can also help State delegates keep informed with daily developments.50 Governments are not 
positioned to provide such reporting because their focus is on negotiating.51 In a multi-forum 
negotiation, such as the climate change negotiations and CITES negotiations, such reporting can 
provide governments with critical information. In addition to providing such information at 
meetings, NGOs also convey a simple and easily understood message regarding complex 
negotiations to the public.52  
 
NGOs also may provide important support for international secretariats. In some cases, that may 
be by serving as the secretariat, such as when the International Union for Conservation of Nature 
served as the secretariat during early days of the Ramsar Convention.53 Additionally, NGOs can 
provide information, such as background papers and other informational documents, to a 
secretariat.54

45 The Basel Convention, for example, includes non-State actors on its compliance committee. See Basel 
Convention, Mechanism for Promoting Implementation and Compliance with the Obligations Under the Basel 
Convention, para. 3 (As adopted by the sixth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (decision VI/12), and 
amended by the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (decision BC-10/11)) (stating that the compliance 
committee consists of 15 members nominated by the Parties, as opposed to 15 Parties). The implementation 
committee of the Agreement on International Dolphin Conservation and Protection also includes non-State actors, 
including representatives from the Humane Society International and the fishing industry. Agreement on the 
International Dolphin Conservation Program, May 1, 1998, Annex 2, para. 3, available at: 
http://www.iattc.org/IDCPDocumentsENG.htm (stating that the review panel shall include “three representatives of 
non-governmental environmental organizations with recognized experience in matters pertaining to this Agreement 
and with offices in the territory of a Party, and three representatives from the tuna industry that operates under the 
jurisdiction of any of the Parties in the Agreement Area (“non-governmental members”).

Finally, NGOs may play an important role after negotiations are over.55 Without domestic 
support, an international treaty may collapse after negotiations are complete. NGOs are often 
important domestic players; involving them in international negotiations may help negotiators 
gauge domestic support during the negotiation and may also help after negotiations when States 
are trying to implement domestic policies.56 For example, NGO support for the North American 
Agreement on Environmental Cooperation—a side agreement to North American Free Trade 
Agreement—helped spur adoption of the free trade agreement.57  
 
NGOs provide meaningful support throughout the life of an MEA: during its negotiation, prior to 
meetings, during meetings, and after meetings. This participation “enhances the ability, in both 
technocratic and political terms, of states to regulate through the treaty process.”58  
 
III. 
A Summary of Practices in MEAs, RFMOs, and ISOs 
 
 
This section summarizes the rules for observer participation across a range of MEAs, 
RFMOs, and ISOs. As an overview, it does not include all the details found in the various 
documents reviewed. More detail can be found in the Annex.  
 
A. Criteria for Admission of Observers 
 
Each of the MEAs, RFMOs, and ISOs reviewed allows NGOs and other organizations to attend 
and participate as observers without voting rights in meetings of the relevant decision-making 
body.59 To attend and participate, NGOs must request permission from the relevant 
administrative body, usually the secretariat, and meet specified technical requirements.60  
 
The criteria for admission of observers are typically written broadly, although limited by a 
requirement to be technically qualified in the area covered by the convention. The CBD, 
Montreal Protocol, CITES, CMS and others require NGOs to be “qualified in fields” relating to 
that MEA, RFMO, or ISO, such as biodiversity conservation in the context of the CBD.61 The 
IOTC requires organizations to have “special competence in the field of activity of the 
                                                
55 See Raustiala, supra note 1, at 731.

Activities to be implemented domestically due to opposition from NGOs. Id.

note 18, at art. 14(2). 
60 See, e.g. CITES, supra note 6, at art. XI(7); UNFCCC, supra note 18, at art. 7(6). 
61 See, e.g., CBD, supra note 5, at art. 23(5) (“qualified in fields relating to conservation and sustainable use of 
biological diversity”); UNFCCC, supra note 18, at art. 7(6) (“qualified in matters covered by the Convention”); 
CITES, supra note 6, at art. XI(7) (technically qualified in protection, conservation or management of wild fauna 
and flora”); Antigua Convention, supra note 21, at art. XV(1) (“recognized experience in matters pertaining to the 
Commission and the tuna industry”).

Commission.”62 The WCPFC requires NGOs to be “concerned with matters relevant to 
implementation” of the WCPF Convention.63  
 
Regardless of the language used, NGOs representing diverse interests, including animal welfare 
organizations, trade associations, user groups, and others have participated in meetings of these 
bodies. With only one exception, this broad inclusion and broad interpretation of the criteria for 
admission of observers spans MEAs, RFMOs, and ISOs. Of the international organizations 
reviewed in this report, only the CCSBT appears to limit observer participation based on 
qualifications in any significant way.64 
 
B. Application Requirements and Deadlines for Obtaining Observer Status 
 
Each of the MEAs, RFMOs, and ISOs reviewed in this paper has a specific process for an 
organization to apply for observer status. Each requires an organization to submit specific 
information to the convention’s administrative body for consideration, such as a description of 
the organization’s activities that demonstrate it is qualified in the field relating to the relevant 
MEA, RFMO, or ISO. Each also requires an application to be submitted prior to the meeting; 
these deadlines typically range from just “prior to the meeting”65 to 100 days. One, the CCSBT, 
does not give a specific deadline but the application must be submitted in time to allow the 
Secretary to advise Members of the request 50 days before the meeting.66 The UNFCCC is an 
outlier, requiring NGOs to submit documentation more than one year prior to a meeting;67 
however, once that documentation is submitted, the accepted organization does not need to 
resubmit its documentation for subsequent meetings.68 ICCAT, IATTC, IOTC and CCSBT also 
assess an application only once without requiring observers to reapply for admission.69 
 
Eleven of the MEAs, RFMOs, and ISOs reviewed allow Members to object to an organization’s 
participation. Most commonly (CMS, CITES, IATTC, ICCAT, CBD, Montreal Protocol, and 
UNFCCC), observers may participate unless one-third of the Parties or Members object to an 
organization’s participation.70 The IATTC and ICCAT consider applications as accepted unless

one-third of Contracting Parties object in writing at least 30 days before the meeting,71 with the 
IATTC requiring objections to be for cause.72 The WCPFC requires a majority of Members to 
object in writing.73 Others, however, are more restrictive; the CCSBT requires all Members to 
approve the NGO’s participation74 while NAFO and the IOTC require a vote on the matter if one 
Member objects.75 
 
C. Fees for Participation 
 
Many MEAs, RFMOs, and ISOs have rules allowing the relevant administrative body to impose 
a standard participation fee on observer organizations, but in practice few actually impose fees 
on observers. In fact, a recent CITES document76 shows that nine MEAs do not charge fees. 
These include five MEAs reviewed in this paper: CBD, CMS, the Montreal Protocol (and the 
associated Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer), and UNFCCC. The other 
MEAs that do not charge fees are the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary 
Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior 
Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International 
Trade, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, and the Convention on 
Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar Convention).77 
Only the International Whaling Commission and the International Tropical Timber Organization 
charge fees.78 
  
 The CITES document is consistent with the findings of this report. Of the MEAs reviewed, only 
CITES charges a fee: for each meeting of the Conference of the Parties, the first observer for an 
organization must pay $600 with each additional observer paying $300.79 Among the RFMOs, 
ICCAT requires observers to pay a fee for each meeting: $500 for up to two observers and an 
additional 350 US$ fee has to be paid for each additional person in the observer delegation.80 It

previously charged $2,000 but reduced the fee to “allow [] access to all relevant NGOs, and thus 
enhance[e] transparency and inclusiveness.”81 The IATTC charges $500 for the first observer 
and $350 for each additional observer.82 The IOTC allows the administrative body or the 
Commission itself to implement a fee for observer participation,83 but it has never charged a 
fee.84 Neither does the CCSBT.85 PICES charged participants in its 2015 annual meeting 
between $50 and $275 (Canadian) depending on the person’s status (for example, student, 
invited speaker, or non-speaking participant).86 
 
The fees charged are intended to cover the additional costs arising from the observers’ 
participation. For example, the IOTC Rules of Procedure state that the Commission may decide 
to “request a contribution towards the additional administrative costs arising from the attendance 
of observers at its Sessions.”87 The IATTC rules for registration include similar language.88 
CITES similarly provides that fees relate to the “effective costs of participation” of observers.89 
 
D. Observer Participation in Meetings  
 
Each MEA, RFMO, and ISO allows observers to attend the plenary session of the convention,90 
Nine of them, however, have possible restrictions on that ability. For example, the CBD, 
UNFCCC, CCSBT, CITES, CMS, CBD, and IOTC allow the Members to close a session to 
observers through a vote.91 Sometimes a simple majority is needed to close a session, as in 
CITES meetings;92 at other times a two-thirds majority is needed to close a session as at CMS 
meetings.93 These bodies sometimes do, in fact, close meetings, claiming a need to ensure 
confidentiality, avoid politicizing issues (for example, regarding compliance issues), or conduct

sensitive discussions and hard bargaining (for example, regarding the budget).94 The treaty and 
the applicable Rules of Procedure do not always identify when meetings can be closed, although 
ICCAT rules limit closed meetings to “extraordinary meetings held in executive sessions or 
meetings of Heads of Delegations.”95 Meetings of the WCPFC and its subsidiary bodies should 
be closed only in “exceptional circumstances.”96 One comprehensive review of NGO 
participation in MEAs concluded that meetings should be closed to NGOs on a case-by-case 
basis and that only “very limited exceptions to the general rule of access to meetings on the basis 
of well-defined criteria (e.g. consideration of confidential information) might be justifiable.”97 
ICES and PICES observers can attend with agreement of the Council.  
 
Whether or not observers can attend meetings other than plenary sessions is often less clear. 
Several agreements do not specifically enable an observer to attend each meeting but more 
vaguely note that all proceedings are open to observers. CITES and CMS allow observers to 
participate in committees,98 but require the chair to invite observers to working group meetings.99 
While most working groups are open to observers, sometimes the chair will limit the number of 
observers that may participate or omit observer participation completely if the issue is considered 
politically sensitive.100 ICCAT allows observers to participate in working groups, although the 
chair may limit their participation.101 At the other end of the spectrum, the UNFCCC rarely, if 
ever, allows observers to participate in working group meetings.102 In fact, the UNFCCC created 
a new kind of meeting—“informal-informals”—to exclude from meetings observers who would 
otherwise have the right to participate in the meeting.103 IOTC meetings are open to observers 
unless the IOTC decides otherwise.104 Further, ICES has specific procedures for evaluating if 
observers can attend different sessions, some of which require advanced notice of an observer’s 
desire to attend the specified meeting. CBD allows observers to attend specific meetings.  
 
An observer’s ability to participate in other ways is not always specified. Some MEAs, RFMOs, 
and ISOs make clear that observers may make oral statements and, if permission is granted, 
display posters and exhibits in specified areas. Each treaty allows observers to address the 
plenary meeting. Treaties sometimes specify limits on observer participation, for example, by 
allowing the Chair to call a speaker to order, determine the order of speaking, and limit the 
amount of time or number of times an observer can speak. Finally, IATTC, ICCAT, and ICES 
also vaguely note that observers may participate in other ways as appropriate without specifying

what those ways would be or when it is appropriate. The WCPFC allows observers to participate 
and intervene at its meetings even though the Rules of Procedure state that NGO observers are 
only entitled to “sit” at meetings.105 
 
E. Receipt of Meeting Documents by Observers 
 
The rules of the MEAs, RFMOs, and ISOs reviewed do not always articulate whether observers 
may obtain relevant documents, including (1) proposals, draft resolutions, and budget documents 
submitted prior to the meeting, (2) in-session revisions to proposals, draft resolutions, budget 
documents, (3) summary records of the meeting, and (4) informational documents. However, 
most if not all of the MEAs, RFMOs, and ISOs reviewed in this report make all documents 
available to observers at the same time they are made available to the parties or members.106 The 
IATTC, IOTC, and NAFO have specific deadlines for making specific documents available to 
observers and members simultaneously.107 That said, RFMOs and fisheries scientific bodies 
sometimes protect confidential information from being disclosed to observers.108 Also, the 
IATTC and WCPFC sometimes restrict documents under active negotiation to members only.109 
The practice within a specific MEA, RFMO, or ISO often provides the culture of document 
distribution, with the official website frequently being the most common way for a document to 
be distributed.  
 
F. Distribution of Documents by Observers 
 
The distribution of documents by observers is generally permissible, although the types of 
documents that observers may distribute may be restricted or require approval through the 
relevant administrative body or the chair. CITES, for example, expressly allows documents to be 
submitted without review by the Secretariat, provided that the observer’s organization offering 
the documents is clearly identified.110 IOTC limits the distribution of documents by observers to 
those documents invited by the IOTC.111 NAFO limits the distribution of documents to only

through the general information table.112 WCPFC allows submission of written comments but 
only through the Secretariat. 113 The Montreal Protocol requires clearance by the Secretariat to 
avoid distribution of information and materials that might be offensive or not related to the 
objectives of the Protocol.114 Both CBD and UNFCCC preclude the distribution of documents in 
official meeting rooms but allow distribution of observer documents at designated locations.115 
 
IV. 
Conclusion  
 
The rules for observer participation in the MEAs, RFMOs, and ISOs are generally consistent 
with the view that NGOs are an integral part of negotiations and “partners” in the process of 
negotiating text, monitoring implementation, and assessing compliance. While the rules vary 
among the MEAs, RFMOs, and ISOs reviewed, most allow expansive participation, including 
the ability to attend most meetings, speak in most meetings, receive most if not all documents, 
and distribute documents. They also charge no fees for observer participation or an amount 
designed to pay for the added cost of their participation in a meeting. 
 
Against that background, the suggestion of some WCPFC members that observers should pay a 
large fee to participate in WCPFC meetings is inconsistent with current practice. While some 
MEAs, RFMOs, and ISOs charge a fee, most do not and certainly no MEA, RFMO, or ISO 
charges anything close to $10,000. In fact, ICCAT rescinded its $2,000 fee as inequitable and 
inconsistent with transparency. 
 
In addition, the ISC’s rules for observer participation are inconsistent with the rules reviewed for 
this paper; they are far more restrictive than even the most restrictive rules for observer 
participation. 
 
ISC Protocol Rules (ISC, Observer Protocol 
(June 2013) 
Summary Analysis 
Observers must apply at least 60 days in 
advance of the ISC meeting and a single 
member may veto an observer application 
without explanation 
• Consistent. While applications deadlines 
vary, 60 days is within the timeframe of many 
of the MEAs, RFMOs, and ISOs reviewed in 
this report. 
• Inconsistent. The authority of a single 
member to veto the participation of an observer 
is inconsistent; of the MEAs, RFMOs, and 
ISOs reviewed here, only the CCSBT has a 
similar rule.

• Inconsistent. Observers are typically allowed 
the right to speak on any matter, provided they 
speak when called on by the Chair.

Annex 
 
The Rules for Observer Participation in Select Multilateral Environmental Agreements, 
Regional Fisheries Management Organizations, and International Scientific Bodies 
 
This Annex provides the information from which the summaries of observer participation in 
Section III of the report are taken. The information is current through June 8, 2016.  
 
A. Criteria for Admission of Observers 
 
1. Multilateral Environmental Agreements 
 
The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) allows both governmental and non-
governmental, that are “qualified in fields relating to conservation and sustainable use of 
biological diversity” to be admitted as an observer to a meeting of the Conference of the Parties 
after the organization informs the Secretariat of its desire to be represented and unless one third 
of Parties present objects.116 Similarly, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety—adopted by the 
CBD Parties—allows governmental or non-governmental bodies “qualified in matters covered 
by this Protocol” to participate as observers at meetings of the Protocol’s Parties after informing 
the Secretariat of the desire to attend and unless at least one-third of the Parties present object.117 
Both the CBD and the Cartagena Protocol allow the United Nations, its specialized agencies, and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency, and any State not a party to be observers at meetings of 
the Conference of the Parties.118 
 
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 
(CITES) allows “any body or agency technically qualified in protection, conservation or 
management of wild fauna and flora” to attend meetings of the parties as observers.119 To attend, 
observers must follow certain procedures. For example, all observers—whether governmental or 
non-governmental—must inform the Secretariat of their desire to attend and, in the case of 
national NGOs, must obtain approval from the State in which they are located. 120 The Parties 
also adopted a resolution that requires an NGO to be “an organization in its own right, with a 
legal persona and an international character, remit and programme of activities.”121 If they follow 
these procedures, observers have the right to attend the meeting unless one-third of the Parties 
present object.122 However, the Secretariat generally does not deny organizations observer

protocol. CBD, supra note 5, at art. 32(2). The admission and participation of observers are subject to the Rules of 
Procedures. Id. at art. 32(1). Similarly, Parties to the Convention that are not Parties to the Protocol may participate 
as observers in the meetings of the Protocol as observers. Cartagena Protocol, supra note 109, at art. 29 (2).

status123 nor do Parties generally object to an organization participating as an observer.124 CITES 
also allows the United Nations, its specialized agencies, the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, and any State not a Party to the Convention to attend the meeting as observers without 
following the procedures that other observers must follow.125  
 
Each of the CITES subsidiary bodies—the Standing Committee, Animals Committee, and Plants 
Committee—has its own rules of procedure that allow governmental bodies and NGOs to 
participate in its meetings.126 Technically, the chair of the relevant committee invites the 
observers to participate127 but in practice the process is run by the secretariat. Representatives of 
Parties who are not represented on the committees may also attend meetings as observers with 
the right to participate but not to vote.128  
 
Under these rules, a wide variety of organizations have participated in CITES meetings. These 
include representatives from organizations supporting, on the one hand, the pet industry, zoos, 
captive breeding operations, the coral industry, various fisheries associations, and others 
supporting international trade in species. They also include a variety of groups more resistant to 
international trade have been admitted as observers, including those opposing sport hunting and 
other lethal uses of wildlife.129  
 
The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) allows 
national and international agencies or bodies—whether governmental or non-governmental—to 
participate in meetings of the parties, provided that they are “technically qualified in protection, 
conservation and management of migratory species.”130 The text of the convention requires 
national NGOs to obtain approval of the State in which they are located,131 although in practice 
that is not required.132 If they follow these procedures, observers have the right to participate in 
the meeting unless one-third of the Parties present object,133 although no legitimate organization

has ever been denied access.134 Admission of observers is confirmed at the beginning of the 
meeting, although prior to a meeting the Secretariat provides Parties with a list of organizations 
that have requested observer status and asks that any Party with an objection inform the 
Secretariat before the meeting.135 The United Nations, its Specialized Agencies, the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, and any State not a party may also be represented by observers at 
meetings of the Conference of the Parties without following the procedures that other observers 
must follow.136  
 
In addition, observers may attend meetings of the CMS Standing Committee and Scientific 
Council. With respect to participation at a Standing Committee meeting, an observer that has 
attended the meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) immediately preceding the Standing 
Committee meeting may attend at its own expense after providing notice to the Secretariat.137 If a 
body or agency did not attend the previous meeting of the COP, it may participate in a Standing 
Committee meeting if it submits a request to the secretariat at least 30 days before the meeting 
with information describing its technical qualifications, the names of individuals who are 
authorized to attend the meeting, and confirmation that the observer will meet its own 
expenses.138 The chair of the Scientific Council also has discretion to invite organizations to 
participate in meetings of the Council.139 As with CITES, a wide range of groups have attended 
CMS meetings, including those favoring wildlife protection and those favoring the use of 
wildlife for human benefit.140 
 
The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Montreal Protocol) 
specifies that organizations “qualified in fields relating to the protection of the ozone layer” may 
request and be admitted as observers unless one-third of the Parties present object.141 The 
Montreal Protocol further requires the Secretariat to “encourage non-Parties to attend meetings 
of the Parties as observers.”142 Observers, once invited by the President, may participate without 
the right to vote in any meeting in “matters of direct concern to the body or agency they 
                                                
134 See E-mail from Melanie Virtue, Head, Aquatic Species Team, Convention on the Conservation of Migratory 
Species of Wild Animals, to author (Sept. 9, 2015) (on file with author). Similarly, the Secretariat has denied 
observer status for individuals who apply but do not represent an organization. Personal observation.

represent.”143 As with CITES and CMS, the United Nations, its specialized agencies and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, as well as any State not party to the Protocol, may be 
represented at meetings of the Parties as observers without following the procedures that other 
observers must follow for accreditation.144 A relatively small number of observers attend Montreal 
Protocol meetings compared to CITES and CMS, but these observers include industry groups 
supporting the use of ozone depleting substances, such as the International Pharmaceutical Aerosol 
Consortium and Japan Fluorocarbon Manufacturers Association, and those seeking stronger rules 
to phase out the use of ozone depleting substances more quickly, including the Environmental 
Investigation Agency and Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development.145  
 
 
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in 
language similar to the CBD’s, permits governmental and non-governmental bodies that are 
“qualified in matters covered by the Convention” and that have informed the Secretariat of the 
desire to attend a meeting as an observer to be admitted unless one-third of the Parties present 
object.146 The United Nations, its specialized agencies and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, and State members that are not Parties can also be admitted as observers.147 The 
convention’s Subsidiary Body for Implementation expressly encourages the participation of 
NGOs from developing countries and countries with economies in transition.148 The number of 
groups attending UNFCCC meetings is very broad, including academic, research, and business 
organizations, as well as those seeking a total phrase out of fossil fuels and those representing the 
fossil fuel industry.149 Some organizations appear to attend solely to perform public 
demonstrations opposing the use of fossil fuels.150

The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) may invite inter-
governmental organizations and, on request, NGOs that have “special competence concerning 
southern bluefin tuna” to attend meetings of the Commission as observers.151 The Commission

may also invite NGOs that are “competent to contribute to the attainment of the objectives of the 
Convention” to be an observer.152 The Commission determines which organizations to invite as 
observers for the next meeting at the immediately preceding meeting,153 and the decision to 
invite an organization requires the approval of all Members.154 The Commission may also 
approve long-term observer status.155 Five intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and four 
NGOs have been granted with long-term observer status, including Birdlife International, Human 
Society International, TRAFFIC, and World Wildlife Fund–Australia.156 When it does, it must 
specify which meetings the organization may attend (e.g., annual meetings, compliance 
committee meetings, and others). Long-term observer status remains in force until canceled by 
the Commission upon the written request of a Member made 60 days prior to the next 
meeting.157 The Executive Secretary informs the Members and affected observer of the request 
and the reasons, and long-term observer status ceases with the receipt of the request.158  
 
The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) promotes transparency in its 
decision-making through, among other things, “facilitating consultations with, and the effective 
participation of, non-governmental organizations, representatives of the fishing industry, 
particularly the fishing fleet, and other interested bodies and individuals.”159 To that end, IGOs 
whose work is relevant to the implementation of this Convention and non-Parties interested in 
conservation and sustainable use of the fish stocks may participate in meetings of the 
Commission.160 In addition, NGOs—“including environmental organizations with recognized 
experience in matters pertaining to the Commission and the tuna industry of any of the members 
of the Commission operating in the Convention Area, particularly the tuna fishing fleet”—may 
also participate in meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies as observers.161 A small 
but diverse group of observers have participated in IATTC meetings, including those from 
environmental organizations, the seafood industry, fishing associations, aquaculture associations, 
and research organizations.162 
 
The convention establishing the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic 
Tunas (ICCAT) does not specifically include provisions for observer participation, although it 
does specify that the Commission should cooperate with other international fisheries 
commissions and scientific organizations that might contribute to the work of the 
Commission.163 It also allows the Commission to invite “any appropriate international

organization” to send observers to the meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies.164 
Similarly, the Rules of Procedure do not include rules for NGO participation, while reaffirming 
the ability of “international organizations” to participate in the work of the Commission but not 
to vote.165  
 
However, the ICCAT members have addressed NGO participation through the Guidelines and 
Criteria for Granting Observer Status at ICCAT Meetings.166 These Guidelines allow NGOs that 
“support the objectives of ICCAT and with demonstrated interest in the species under the 
purview of ICCAT” to be eligible to participate as observers in all meetings and subsidiary 
bodies except extraordinary meetings held in executive sessions or meetings of heads of 
delegations.167 ICCAT considers applications as accepted unless one-third of Contracting Parties 
object in writing at least 30 days before the meeting or within 60 days of receipt of an application 
if that is more than 30 days before to the meeting.168 Although not reflected in the ICCAT 
Observer Guidelines and Criteria, once an NGO has had its application for observer status 
approved, it does not need to apply again.169 The Executive Secretary may limit the number of 
observers per NGO that may attend a meeting due to logistical constraints.170 As with the 
IATTC, a small but diverse range of observers attend ICCAT meetings.171 
 
The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) may invite IGOs and NGOs “having special 
competence in the field of activity of the Commission” to attend and participate in Commission 
meetings.172 FAO Members, UN bodies, and a range of international organizations may also 
submit a request to participate in Commission meetings.173 The Commission may also invite 
consultants or experts—as individuals—to attend the meetings or participate in the work of the 
Commission, committees, and other subsidiary bodies.174 The Commission, at the 16th Session, 
agreed that meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies should be open to participation

by observers that attended the current and/or previous sessions of the Commission.175 A diverse 
range of IGOs and NGOs have participated in IOTC meetings, including Birdlife International, 
International Game Fish Association, Rain Forest Rescue International, and the World Wildlife 
Fund.176 
 
The convention establishing the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) does not 
specifically allow IGOs or NGOs to participate in meetings of the Organization; it provides only 
for Contracting Parties that are not Commission Members to attend as observers.177 Nonetheless, 
the Rules of Procedure for Observers allow the Executive Secretary to invite to NAFO-related 
meetings those intergovernmental organizations that have “regular contacts with NAFO as 
regards fisheries matters or whose work is of interest to NAFO or vice-versa” and NGOs that 
“support[] the general objectives of NAFO and with demonstrated interest in the species under 
the purview of NAFO.”178 Consistent with other RFMOs, a small but diverse number of NGO 
observers have participated in NAFO meetings.179 
 
If an NGO does not communicate with the Secretariat or attend a meeting for three years, then 
NAFO suspends that NGO’s observer status, but the NGO may reapply to attend in writing.180 
Further, the Executive Secretary reviews observer accreditation every five years, which includes 
the consideration of new information or developments regarding the NGO in question and sends 
the review to the Members.181 In addition, a Member may object to the renewal of observer 
status in writing—by including the reason for objection—within 30 days of the review; the 
matter is voted on by a written procedure.182 The Executive Secretary will circulate the reasons 
for objections and any comments of Members from the vote, and—without an objection—the 
renewal is considered accepted.183 Due to logistical limitations (e.g., room capacity), the 
Executive Secretary may limit the number of individuals representing each NGO at any meeting 
and will transmit those limitations in the conditions of participation.184 Observers may 
participate, but not vote.185 The three Rules of Procedures—for the General Council,186 Fisheries 
Commission,187 and Scientific Council188—also allow observers to attend plenary or subsidiary 
body meetings.

Transparency in International Agreements (IELP: Nov. 10, 2016) 
 
 
The convention establishing the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission 
(WCPFC) allows IGOs and NGOs “concerned with matters relevant to implementation of this 
Convention” the opportunity to participate as observers in meetings of the Commission and its 
subsidiary bodies.189 The Rules of Procedure add that NGOs must have “demonstrated their 
interest in matters under consideration by the Commission.”190 Non-parties may request observer 
status and—with the concurrence of the Members—may be invited as observers.191 The 
Commission must also cooperate with the FAO, other UN specialized agencies and bodies and 
other international agreements, Commissions, and other organizations to “further the attainment 
of the objective of [the] Convention and to minimize duplication with respect to their work.”192 
These organizations may also participate as observers.193 A guidance document also allows 
cooperating non-members to participate at meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies 
as observers,194 including working groups, and receive relevant documents.195 Generally, 
applying organizations are granted observer status.196 Again, a small but diverse range of NGOs 
attend WCPFC meetings as observers.197 
 
3. International Scientific Organizations 
 
The convention establishing the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) 
allows organizations to participate as observers in meetings of the Council. ICES allows 
organizations that have objectives “related to those of the Council” to be invited by the 
Commission as observers.198 ICES guidelines specifically state that governmental, IGOs, NGOs,

and individuals are eligible to be observers.199 Organizations should “support the general 
objectives of ICES and have competence in the area of ICES’ work.”200 Similarly, individuals 
should “endorse the objectives of ICES and also have an expressed interest in the work of 
ICES.”201 Organizations must apply for observer status and individuals need to be registered as 
observers for specific meetings.202 The General Secretary may limit the number of observers 
admitted to a meeting based on logistical limitations. The General Secretary should base that 
decision on the “need for a balanced participation preserving the scientific nature and integrity of 
the work” and include such a limitation in the conditions of participation.203 
 
The resolution establishing the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 
Services (IPBES) does not discuss observer participation.204 However, a second document 
adopted at the same time allows for the participation of States that are not members of the 
Platform, as well as U.N. bodies and other governmental, intergovernmental, or non-
governmental bodies, organizations, or agencies, including organizations for indigenous peoples 
and local communities that are “qualified in matters covered by the Platform” and that have 
requested observer status.205 Those groups are subject to the Rules of Procedure.206 More than 50 
organizations participated in the 2015 IPBES Plenary meeting.207 
 
The convention establishing the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES) allows 
the Council to invite “states, organizations, and experts to attend scientific meetings of the 
Organization, or to participate in activities of the Organization based on terms established by the 
Council.208 The treaty defines “observer” as “a person, formally invited by the Council to 
observe some aspect of its activities.”209 The Rules of Procedure elaborate that the Council may 
invite any government not a Party, any international or other organization “having objectives 
related to those of the Organization,” and individuals to participate in particular meetings of the

range of participants.211 
 
B. Application Requirements and Deadlines for Obtaining Observer Status  
 
1. Multilateral Environmental Agreements 
 
To apply for observer status at CBD meetings, an organization must send an official letter of 
interest to the Secretariat.212 The letter of interest must be on the organization’s letterhead and 
signed by the organization’s chief executive or president, include a clear request to attend a 
specific meeting, and the names, titles, and contact information of nominated representatives.213 
Further, an organization that has not recently been admitted as an observer must also include a 
statement on the organization’s qualifications in fields related to conservation and sustainable 
use of biological diversity, the organization’s website address, the by-laws or terms of reference 
that show it is a bona fide organization in its home country, and any other relevant information 
including any changes in the organization’s information.214 Individuals without an affiliation 
with an organization cannot be admitted as observers.215 Only organizations that have 
communicated with the Secretariat as above and pre-registered their representatives will receive 
a badge for meetings.216 Finally, the CBD generally requires that representatives are at least 18 
years old, although the Secretariat has discretion to admit younger individuals.217 
 
At CITES meetings, observers may attend the Conference of the Parties and the Standing, 
Animals, and Plants Committees provided they follow the relevant application process (and meet 
the admission criteria described in Section A). To attend the Conference of the Parties, an 
organization requests observer status by submitting the names of its observers, and, if a national 
NGO, evidence of approval of the State in which the organization is located, to the Secretariat at 
least six weeks before the meeting.218 A Resolution further directs the Secretariat not to accept 
additional observer names after the six-week deadline and not to accept changes to names except 
where an organization has registered no more than two observers before the deadline and the 
Secretariat believes that the change in the representative is due to force majeure.219 Similarly, at 
least 30 days before a meeting of the Standing Committee, an organization must submit to the 
Secretariat relevant information on the organization’s technical qualifications, the names of the 
observers authorized to represent the organization, proof of the approval of the State in which the

national NGO is located or in which the IGO is headquartered.220 The Animals Committee and 
Plants Committee require an organization to request observer status from the Secretariat at least 
30 days before the meeting to allow the Secretariat to publish a list of invited organizations after 
the 30-day deadline.221 Invitations to the Plants and Animals Committees may be withdrawn if 
the Committee agrees to do so before the meeting starts.222 
 
To attend CMS meetings, an organization requests observer status by submitting the names of its 
representatives—and, if an NGO, evidence of approval of the State in which they are located—to 
the Secretariat prior to the opening of the meeting.223 The organization must submit that letter 
with a request to attend the meeting before the opening of the meeting for the Conference of the 
Parties.224 The rules do not specify a deadline for submitting such a request to attend the 
Conference of the Parties. 
 
An organization may also request from the Secretariat an invitation to participate as an observer 
at Standing Committee meetings.225 Such a request should include relevant information on the 
organization’s technical qualifications, the names of observers that have been authorized to 
represent the organization at the meeting of the Standing Committee, and conformation that an 
observer will meet its own expenses.226 Finally, requests to attend the Standing Committee must 
be submitted 30 days before the meeting.227 After requests are received, the Secretariat forwards 
them to the chair and members of the Committee for approval.228 
 
The Montreal Protocol does not elaborate on the requirements for an organization to obtain 
observer status. According to the Protocol’s Chief of Legal Affairs and Compliance, an 
organization must simply submit its information to show it meets the general technical 
requirements established by the Protocol.229 After submitting this information and receiving

observers representing a state or an organization have been granted credentials that enable him or her to represent 
the State or organization at the meeting before making an intervention, and such credentials—including a version 
translated into one of the working languages—must be presented to the Secretariat. Id. at Rule 8, 9. The Secretariat 
reviews the credentials and brings any potential problems to the Committee. Id. at Rule 9. Finally, the Committee 
decides—based on the Secretariat’s report—whether to accept credentials. Id. at Rule 10. Observers invited by the

approval to participate, the organization does not need to submit this information to participate in 
any subsequent meeting.230 
 
To be admitted as an observer to UNFCCC meetings, organizations must provide a statement of 
competence in Convention matters, confirmation of independent juridical personality, and 
confirmation of non-profit or tax exempt status.231 In addition, they must submit a range of other 
documents, including, inter alia, certified copies of documents on the scope, mandate, and 
governing structure of the organization; a recent annual report including a financial statement; a 
list of donors and funding sources from the past two years; and information on the organization’s 
activities for the past year that indicate competence in matters relating to the UNFCCC.232 An 
organization must use the Online Admission System to submit this documentation.233 The system 
automatically defers incomplete applications to the next review cycle.234  
 
The UNFCCC does not have standard deadlines but the Secretariat establishes the deadline for 
applications for each meeting.235 For example for admission to the 21st Conference of the Parties 
occurring November 30 to December 11, 2015, the deadline was August 31, 2014.236 The 
Secretariat creates a list of eligible applicants, communicates that list to the Bureau, and informs 
organizations that they may attend a session if there is no objection by the Bureau.237 The final 
decision on admission rests with the Conference of the Parties and is considered at the following 
session.238 The Conference of the Parties decides on participation at meetings of the UNFCCC 
but also of the Kyoto Protocol.239 After the Conference of the Parties has admitted an 
organization as an observer, that organization may attend subsequent meetings without 
reapplying, —unless the organization was admitted for only a specific session.240  
 
 
2. Regional Fisheries Management Organizations 
 
To attend CCSBT meetings, an NGO must provide the Executive Secretary with an explanation 
of the organization’s competence concerning southern bluefin tuna or competence to contribute 
to the attainment of the objectives of the Convention.241 That information must be sent at least 60 
days before a meeting to request long-term observer status and 50 days before a meeting to

request observer status at a single meeting.242 The Executive Secretary then sends the Members a 
list of organizations that have requested observer status along with information submitted by the 
organization at least 50 days before a meeting of the CCSBT.243 The CCSBT decides whether to 
extend invitations but also relies on the advice of the Executive Secretary.244 However, a 
Member may object to the invitation of a specific organization by writing to the Executive 
Secretary with the reasons for the objection.245 If an objection is filed, the Executive Secretary 
notifies both the Members and the affected organization, and the CCSBT considers the issue at 
an early point at its next meeting.246 If there are no objections, the Executive Secretary issues 
invitations to observers no later than 28 days before the opening of the meeting.247 To complete 
the process to obtain observer status, an organization must accept the invitation in writing and 
inform the Executive Secretary of the representatives that will attend the meeting at least at least 
14 days before the meeting.248 
 
To participate as an observer at IATTC meetings, an organization must send the Director a 
request that includes the NGO’s name and office location, a description of the mission, and how 
the mission and activities are related to work of the Commission.249 That request must be 
submitted at least 50 days before the meeting although Director has greater flexibility with that 
deadline if a meeting is called with less than 50 days notice.250 The Director then transmits to the 
Members at least 45 days before the meeting the names of any NGOs wishing to participate and 
related information that those NGOs have submitted.251 NGOs may also request permission to 
participate as an observer on an annual basis.252 An NGO obtains observer status unless at least 
one-third of the Members object for cause in writing.253 The Director communicates 
extraordinary meetings to non-Members and IGOs invited to the meeting as observers at least 45 
days before the meeting and posts the announcement of the meeting on the website as soon as 
possible.254  
 
To participate in ICCAT meetings, an NGO must notify the Secretariat and provide the name, 
address, telephone and fax number of the organization, addresses of all its national/regional 
offices, the organization’s aims and purposes and how they relate to ICCAT’s objectives, a brief

history of the organization and a description of its activities, any relevant papers produced by or 
for the organization, any past observer status at ICCAT, and the information or input that the 
organization proposes to present.255 An NGO must present that required information at least 50 
days before the meeting.256 An observer delegation must also submit the pre-registration form on 
ICCAT’s website.257 The Executive Secretary then reviews applications and, at least 45 days 
before the meeting, submits to the Members the names of NGOs wishing to participate along 
with their qualifications.258 After review, the Executive Secretary will send invited organizations 
a notification of the decision convening a regular meeting at least 90 days before the meeting or 
30 days in the case of a special meeting.259 
 
The IOTC has different processes to apply for observer status for different types of 
organizations or States: Members or Associate Members of the FAO, Members of the United 
Nations or its specialized agencies, intergovernmental organizations, and NGOs.260 In all cases, 
an organization must email the IOTC Secretariat a letter addressed to the chairperson of the 
IOTC that describes the organization’s interest in attending IOTC meetings, including 
background on how the organization’s attendance will benefit IOTC processes.261 If the IOTC 
agrees to invite the organization or States, a letter of invitation is issued to the organization.262 
An NGO must submit its request at least 60 days before the meeting so that the Executive 
Secretary can send Members the list of NGOs requesting observer status at least 60 days before 
the Session.263 If a Member objects in writing and by giving reasons for it objection within 30 
days, the Commission decides the matter through a written procedure.264  
 
NAFO requires an NGO seeking observer status to submit an application to the Secretariat that 
includes the name, address, telephone and fax number of the organization, addresses of all its 
national/regional offices, the aims and purposes of the organization and a “statement that the 
NGO fully supports the objectives of NAFO, i.e., optimum utilization, rational management and 
conservation of the fishery resources of the NAFO Convention Area,” the organization’s total 
number of members, decision-making process funding, brief history and a description of its 
activities, papers or other resources produced by or for the organization on the “conservation, 
management, or science of fishery resources to which the Convention applies,” and a history of 
the organization’s observer status.265 An NGO must apply for observer status by emailing the 
Secretariat266 at least 100 days before the meeting it wishes to attend.267 The Executive Secretary

then transmits to the Members the names of the NGOs wishing to attend and their qualifications. 
If, within 30 days, one or more Members objects in writing and gives reasons for its objection, 
the Executive Secretary circulates the reasons for the objection to Members, who then decide by 
voting through a written procedure whether to accept the organization as an observer.268 As part 
of its vote, a Member may include comments. If no objection is made, an NGO’s application is 
considered accepted.269 To complete the process, an NGO must register its representatives with 
the Secretariat at least 14 days before the meeting.270 
 
To participate in WCPFC meetings, an NGO must notify the Executive Director in writing of 
that desire at least 50 days before a session.271 The Executive Director notifies the Members of 
such requests at least 45 days before the session and NGOs are invited unless a majority of the 
Members objects to a request in writing at least 20 days before the session.272 Observer status 
remains in effect for future sessions unless the Commission decides otherwise.273 The Executive 
Director will notify admitted observers of the date, place, and provisional agenda as soon as 
possible but at least 90 days before a session or 25 days before a special session.274 Observers are 
represented by designated representatives, alternative representatives, or advisors and must 
submit those names to the Executive Director no later than 24 hours after the opening of the 
session in a standard form of designation as the Executive Director establishes.275  
 
3. International Scientific Organizations 
 
An application to apply for observer status at ICES meetings must include the name, address, 
telephone number, and email address of the organization or individual.276 An organization must 
also include a description that includes the “aims and purposes, activities, history, current 
membership, membership eligibility and whether the organization intends to observe advisory 
services and/or science activities, and/or Council meetings.”277 The next step in applying for 
observer status depends on which activities the observer wants to observe. The chair of the 
Science Committee or a specific Science Committee expert group decides if an organization will 
be invited as an observer.278 Similarly, requests to attend Advisory Services are circulated to the 
Advisory Committee and the Council and accepted ten days later unless a Member objects.279 If 
a Member objects to such a request, the chair conducts a web conference that any objecting

Members may participate in to decide the matter.280 However, ultimately the Advisory 
Committee is empowered to resolve the matter.281  
 
Although IPBES has not yet established the policy and procedures for admitting observers,282 a 
temporary process for the admission of observers has been used for the Second, Third, and 
Fourth Sessions; under this process, organizations that were admitted at previsions sessions do 
not need to reapply for admission to the next session.283 An organization not previously admitted 
must inform the Secretariat of its desire to attend the next session.284 At the Third Session, each 
new organization was required to provide the scope of its work and its mission, objectives, 
location, year of establishment, and website.285 The Secretariat provides a list of organizations 
requesting observer status to the Bureau, which reviews the list, makes recommendations on 
admittance, and communicates its recommendations to Members at least eight weeks before the 
session.286 Next, Members may communicate their view on a recommendation to the Bureau at 
least two weeks before the Session.287 If a Member raises concerns, the Bureau informs the 
organization of those concerns and, at the meeting, a Member may reject observer status for an 
organization unless that objection is overruled by a two-thirds majority of the Members 
present.288  
 
IPBES considered a draft policy and procedures for the admission of new observers at its Fourth 
Meeting.289 The draft policy was not accepted because some members believe that observers 
should be admitted to a meeting of the Plenary unless at least one third of the Members present

282 At the first session of IPBES, the Plenary determined the policy and procedures on admission of observers for the 
second session. See IPBES, Rules of Procedure for the Plenary of the Platform, supra note 203, at Rule 6(1); IPBES, 
Report of the First Session of the Plenary of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and 
Ecosystem Services, IPBES/1/12, at ¶ 20-22 (2013) available at: http://www.ipbes.net/plenary/ipbes-1. Specifically, 
the Plenary adopted a procedure for the admission of observers for the Second Session and noted that policies and 
procedures would also be established at that session. Id. at ¶ 22. However, the Plenary failed to finalize procedures 
at the Second or Third Sessions and instead agreed to continue using those procedures for admitting observers for 
the Second Session at each following meeting (i.e. at the Third Session, it was agreed that those procedures would 
be used for the Fourth Session). See also id. at ¶ 22; IPBES, Report of the Second Session of the Plenary of the 
Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, IPBES/2/17 at ¶ 48, 54 (2014)

objected; others believe that admittance should be by consensus.290 Consequently, IPBES will 
continue with the process described above.291 
  
Under the draft policy, Member States, Observer States of the United Nations, United Nations 
bodies, and secretariats of multilateral environment agreements would be allowed to participate 
as observers without having to submit applications.292 Organizations that already have observer 
status with the UNEP, FAO, United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, 
and the United Nations Development Programme are considered observers if they so request, 
unless the Plenary decides otherwise.293 Further, observers to the first meeting of IPBES are not 
required to submit an application unless the Plenary decides otherwise.294 Other qualified 
organizations are required to submit applications to the Secretariat at least 3 months before a 
session; the application must include documents on the mandate, scope, and governing structure 
of the organization; other information that supports “competence and interest of the 
organization” in related matters; and contact information for the organization and a designated 
focal point, including the organization’s website address.295 The Secretariat reviews this 
information to determine if an applicant is qualified in matters covered by IPBES by the Bureau 
and presents a list of applicants at the session of the Plenary.296 After an organization is admitted, 
it must register for specific sessions and designate and register representatives before a 
session.297 The Secretariat notifies observers of their admittance, along with the venue and dates 
of any session, at least eight weeks before a session.298 The admission of new observers should 
be included as a regular agenda item299 to allow the Plenary to decide on admission and 
participation of all observers.300 The Plenary has not agreed on the number of Members that are 
required to prevent an organization from attending as an observer, and the draft offers two 
options of either only requiring an objection from one member or objections from one-third of 
Members present.301  
 
It does not appear that PICES has established any particular requirements to apply to participate 
in its annual meeting.302

C. Fees for Participation 
 
1. Multilateral Environmental Agreements 
 
Several MEAs, including the CBD, Montreal Protocol, and UNFCCC, do not charge fees.303 
Although CMS allows the Standing Committee to fix a standard participation fee for NGOs and 
announce that fee in the invitation,304 CMS does not currently charge observers a fee because it 
is administratively burdensome to implement.305  
 
For the triennium of 2014-2016, CITES requires that observer organizations, except the UN and 
its specialized agencies, be charged a standard participation fee of at least US$600 for the first 
representative of an observer organization and $300 for each additional representative.306 To 
participate in the meetings of the Standing Committee, Plants Committee, and Animals 
Committee, observers must pay US$100 per representative.307 
 
2. Regional Fisheries Management Organizations 
 
The CCSBT does not charge a fee.308  
 
The Director of IATTC may require observers to pay reasonable fees that cover the costs of their 
attendance.309 For example at the 2015 meeting, IATTC assessed an Observer Registration Fee 
of US$500 for each non-member or NGO participating to cover the attendance of two 
representatives. Organizations also paid US$350 for each additional participant.310 Observers 
who also serve as environmental representatives on specific review panels may also be exempt 
from paying the registration fee.311 
 
To participate in a meeting of ICCAT, observers pay a fee as determined annually by the 
Executive Secretary—currently $500 for the first two participants and $350 for each additional

participant312—for their participation that contributes towards the additional expenses generated 
by the observer participation.313  
 
IOTC allows the Commission—based on a proposal of the Executive Secretary—to charge 
observers a fee to participate in order to cover the additional administrative costs of observer 
attendance and subject to reciprocity in the case of IGOs.314 To date, it has not charged a fee.315 
 
The Executive Secretary of NAFO annually determines if a fee for NGO observers will be 
required and, if so, how much is required to cover the additional expenses from observer 
participation.316 
 
Although WCPFC has considered charging observers a fee for attendance, it currently does not 
charge a fee.317 
 
3. International Scientific Organizations 
 
ICES charges a fee to attend its annual meetings. for its upcoming 2016 meeting, it is charging 
190 Euros (260 Euros for late registration), although students must pay only 70 Euros.318 At the 
2015 annual meeting of PICES, registrants paid the following fees. Primary registrants paid 
$200 (Canadian) for early registration and $275 (Canadian) for regular registration. Convenors 
and invited speakers paid $200 (Canadian) and students paid $50 (Canadian).319 It is not clear 
whether observers to IPBES meetings must pay a fee, although relevant documents suggest that 
they do not.320 
 
D. Observer Participation in Meetings  
 
1. Multilateral Environmental Agreements 
 
At CBD meetings, sessions of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies, including 
working groups, are open to accredited observers unless the Conference of Parties or subsidiary 
body decides otherwise.321 In addition, contact groups are open to observers unless the chair or

convenor closes the meeting.322 A contact group can also decide on its own procedures that may 
limit participation of observers.323 At the friends of the chair group, observers are generally not 
invited to participate but may be invited by the group chair.324  
 
Observers to CBD meetings have several ways to participate. They may, for example, make 
short and concise verbal statements if invited by the chair or group convenor, hold pre-scheduled 
side events or press conferences, make available relevant information materials, and set up 
displays (i.e. exhibitions and posters) if pre-arranged.325 As is typical of international meetings, 
observers typically speak after Parties and non-Party States.326 Observers cannot specifically 
negotiate but can make points or propose text. However, text proposed by an observer 
representative is only included in subsequent documentation if sponsored by a Party.327 
 
Despite these rights to participate, NGOs are not financially supported by the Secretariat to 
participate in CBD meetings.328 In addition, participants shall not harass or threaten other 
participants, interfere with the movement of participants, disrespect the flags or official symbols 
of the United Nations or its member States, and respect other participants’ social, cultural, 
religious or other opinions and refrain from personal attacks.329 A representative that does not 
observe any of the guidelines may have their badge confiscated, be removed from the premises, 
have unauthorized material confiscated, and have other appropriate measures taken against it, 
such as a ban of the organization or representatives from future meetings.330  
 
At CITES meetings, sessions of the plenary and Committees I and II, which meet 
simultaneously, are open to observers, although any session may be closed through a simple 
majority vote of Parties present.331 Observers are seated in a designated area in the meeting room 
and may enter the delegate’s area only if invited to do so by a delegate.332 Although, the 
Secretariat may limit an organization to no more than two observers at those sessions if required 
by seating limitations,333 that rule has not been invoked since at least 1992.334  
 
Similar rules apply to participation and attendance at other meetings and on working groups. 
Participation in sessions of the Credentials Committee or any working group is limited to 
delegates and observers invited by the Presiding Officer when a session is established,335

although observers have never been invited to attend meetings of the Credentials Committee.336 
Observers are also able to attend and participate in meetings of the Standing Committee, 
Animals Committee, and Plants Committee, although each committee has rules that allow 
sessions to be closed.337 When possible, Presiding Officers are directed to invite knowledgeable 
observers to participate in working groups of Committee I and II.338 Observers are commonly 
invited to participate in working groups,339 although on rare occasions observers are excluded 
because of a politically sensitive issue.340  
 
Observers also have the right to speak341 and presiding officers of those sessions are instructed to 
make every effort to allow observers time to make interventions.342 In fact, observers frequently 
make interventions at meetings of the Conference of the Parties, as well as at meetings of the 
subsidiary committees.343 However, the Presiding Officer at the plenary session and sessions of 
Committees I and II, the Credentials Committee, and working groups may limit the number of 
observers that speak and the time they are allowed to speak.344 The Presiding Officer generally 
calls on speakers in the order they desire to speak, with observers speaking after Parties and non-
Party States.345 An observer may speak only if called on by the Presiding Officer and may not be 
interrupted except on a point of order.346 Similarly, at the Standing Committee, Animals 
Committee, and Plants Committee, all admitted observers have the right to speak with the same 
general rules for the order of speaking as at meetings of the Conference of the Parties.347 
Observers may also apply to host and participate in side events, as well as display exhibits at a 
session of the Conference of the Parties.348 
 
In addition, the Secretariat and Parties should choose a venues for meetings that have adequate 
space for observers on the floor for sessions of the plenary, Committee I, and Committee II; each 
observer should have at least one seat on the floor for those meetings.349 Despite these rights, the

Secretariat may not provide sponsorship through the Sponsored Delegates Project to any 
representative that is an NGO observer.350 
 
At CMS meetings, plenary sessions and sessions of the Committee of the Whole are open to the 
public and observers unless a two-thirds majority of Parties present vote to close that session.351 
However, the Parties generally do not exclude observers from a plenary session.352 The Rules 
further include requirements for an observer’s right to speak at a plenary session,353 and 
observers regularly do speak when called on by the chair.354 Sessions of other committees and 
working groups are generally limited to delegates and observers that are invited by the chair of 
the relevant committee or working group.355 Observers, however, are commonly invited to 
different committees, working groups, and subsidiary bodies, although in a small number of 
instances certain working groups deemed politically sensitive by some Parties have restricted 
observer participation.356  
 
Observers to CMS meetings have the right to speak at a plenary session, although the presiding 
officer may limit the number of times an observer may speak on a question.357 The Presiding 
Officer generally calls on speakers in the order they ask to speak, although observers typically 
speak after Parties and non-Party States.358 The chair of a session or working group has 
significant discretion, but meetings generally include a high level of NGO participation.359 
Observers may speak if called on by the Presiding Officer, although that Officer may call a 
speaker to order if the remarks are not relevant.360 A speaker cannot be interrupted except on a 
point of order although a speaker may give way with permission of the Presiding Officer.361 
Further, on a proposal of the Presiding Officer or a delegate, the Conference may limit the time a 
speaker and number of times an observer may speak on a question.362 Although, observers are 
generally given opportunities to intervene, observers have been encouraged to intervene 
collectively.363 Similar rules and practices govern observers right to speak at meetings of the 
Standing Committee and the Scientific Council.364 Observers may also apply to hold side events 
or exhibits at a session of the Conference of the Parties.365

As in other MEAs, the Secretary may limit approved organizations to no more than two 
representatives per organization at a plenary session or a session of the Committee of the Whole 
of a meeting due to logistical limitations. In such circumstances, the Secretariat shall notify 
Parties, observers, and other participants of other limitations before the meeting.366 However, the 
administrative body has generally not applied such logistic limitations.367 
 
At meetings of the Montreal Protocol, observers may attend, make interventions, and 
participate in working groups “without hindrance.”368 They are excluded only from meetings of 
the Implementation Committee.369 
 
Plenary sessions of the UNFCCC Meetings of the Conference of the Parties are held in public 
unless the Conference of the Parties decides otherwise.370 Observers may also attend open-ended 
contact groups if invited by the presiding officer of Convention bodies unless one third of the 
Parties objects, although the presiding officer may also close a group to observers at any time;371 
most contact groups are, in fact, closed.372 Observers cannot attend meetings that are designated 
as closed.373  
 
The plenary session regularly includes a few statements from observers, and the relevant head of 
a session, subsidiary body, or contact group may permit observers, when appropriate, to make 
interventions.374 Practically speaking, observers also have few opportunities to speak.375 
Observers may also apply to hold side events or exhibits at a session.376 
 
In addition, participants at UNFCCC meetings may not harass or threaten other participants and 
must cooperate with and comply with requests and instructions from UN officials and security 
staff.377 Participants may not interfere with the movement of other participants and must treat 
symbols of the United Nations and its member States.378 Observers should not have unauthorized 
demonstrations at UNFCCC venues and should respect other participants’ social, cultural, 
religious or other opinions, and refrain from personal attacks.379

At CCSBT meetings, the opening plenary session is expressly open to the public unless the 
Commission decides otherwise.380 All other sessions of the CCSBT are considered private.381 
Nonetheless, observers may attend public and private sessions of the Commission,382 although, if 
requested by a Member, the Commission may meet without observers to determine if particular 
agenda items or a session should be restricted to Members only.383 The CCSBT chair may invite 
observers to address the Commission unless a Member objects.384  
 
The IATTC permits admitted observers to participate in all meetings of the Commission and its 
subsidiary bodies except meetings held in executive session or meetings of Heads of Delegations 
unless otherwise decided by the Commission.385 In addition, observers may make oral statements 
at meetings if invited by the chair.386 Generally, if time allows, the chair gives NGOs the 
opportunity to intervene after Members are finished intervening,387 and NGOs also engage in 
other appropriate activities that are approved by the chair.388 However, NGOs are regularly 
excluded from discussions of specific topics during meetings.389 
 
IATTC rules also note that observers must comply with all rules and procedures applicable to 
other participants in a meeting, and if an NGO does not comply with the rules and procedures 
they shall be excluded from further participation in meetings unless the Commission decides 
otherwise.390 
 
At ICCAT meetings, an admitted NGO observer may attend all meetings of the organization and 
its subsidiary bodies except extraordinary meetings held in executive session or meetings of the 
heads of delegations.391 Observers may participate in working groups, but their level of 
participation may be determined by the chair of each working group.392 Observers may also, if 
authorized by the chair, make oral statements during the meeting and otherwise participate in the 
work of the commission.”393 Admitted observers for ICCAT meetings must comply with all rules 
and procedures applicable to other participants and failure to do so may result in withdrawal of 
accreditation by the chair.394

Transparency in International Agreements (IELP: Nov. 10, 2016) 
 
Meetings of the IOTC, including the plenary meeting, are open to observers unless the IOTC 
decides otherwise.395 Meetings of the IOTC Scientific Committee, sub-commissions, 
committees, working parties, and other subsidiary bodies are only open to delegates unless the 
IOTC decides otherwise.396 When the IOTC decides to hold a private meeting, it also determines 
if observers may attend that meeting.397 At plenary sessions, observers may deliver oral 
statements if invited by the Commission.398 
 
The IOTC Rules of Procedure also specify that the Director be assured that the Government 
hosting a Session is willing to grant observers the privileges and immunities that are necessary 
for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Session. Further, the 
Commission may enter into agreements with IGOs and institutions, “especially those active in 
the fisheries sector, which might contribute to the work and further the objectives of the 
Commission.” Organizations with those agreements may attend Sessions as observers, submit 
memoranda, and—as appropriate—participate in discussions of the Commission, Committees, 
and other subsidiary bodies of the Commission. IOTC records attendance of observers to 
particular meetings of the Commission or its subsidiary bodies in the relevant meeting report.  
 
Observers at NAFO meetings are invited to “all non-restricted sessions” at both the annual 
meeting and intersessional meetings.399 Observers may address the plenary session400 and attend 
meetings.401 Observers may make statements at a meeting if invited by the chair.402 Observers 
may also engage in other appropriate activities if approved by the chair.403 However, an observer 
may not record a meeting using film, video, or audio or issue press releases to the media on 
agenda items under discussion at a meeting.404 Observers may address both plenary or subsidiary 
body meetings at meetings of the General Council, Scientific Council, and Fisheries 
Commission.405 
 
NAFO observers must comply with all rules and procedures applicable to participants and failure 
to comply may result in removal from a meeting by the Presiding Officer and revocation of

observer status.406 Further, a Member may request to review and revise or amend the rules as 
necessary to “function effectively when conducting its business.”407 
 
The WCPFC specifies that observer participation is not to be “unduly restrictive” and that 
observers should have timely access to pertinent information.408 Consistent with this rule, non-
Member States, fishing entities, and relevant IGOs may “participate” in the deliberations of the 
Commission and its subsidiary bodies. 409 However, NGO observers only have a right to “sit” at 
meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies.410 NGOs are generally allowed to attend a 
meeting except in “exceptional circumstances,” although occasionally they are excluded from a 
meeting,411 and make oral statements. 
 
The WCPF Convention further requires procedures to “obtain[] the views of such organizations,” 
if appropriate. To implement that provision, the Rules of Procedure allow NGOs, if invited by 
the chair and approved by the Commission or relevant subsidiary body, to make oral statements 
on matters within the scope of their activities.412 Although observers are generally allowed to 
speak, they are limited to brief interventions except in rare circumstances where an observer is 
invited to provide presentations on issues within their expertise.413 As the chair has a lot of 
discretion, some chairs are hostile to or impatient with observer interventions.414 To help limit 
observer intervention time and show solidarity, observers occasionally make joint 
interventions.415  
 
NGOs may also distribute written statements relevant to the work of the Commission if approved 
by the chair.416 In practice, NGO documents and statements are routinely placed on the 
WCPFC’s website by the Secretariat.417  
 
3. International Scientific Organizations 
 
At ICES, admitted observers, defined as part of the General Assembly,418 may attend 
meetings.419 Further, any person—with agreement of the Council—may attend and address the

plenary session.420 Further, organizations that are in an agreement with the Conference that 
“specif[ies] delivery of advice” are invited to observe all meetings.421 Observers may also attend 
meetings of the Science Committee and of the Science Committee Expert Groups, although the 
Expert Group meetings require advance notice.422 Further, observers may also attend meetings of 
the Advisory Committee, advice drafting groups, and technical review meetings if they have 
obtained observer status to advisory services with the appropriate advance notice.423 Observers 
are restricted in Advisory expert groups to intergovernmental commissions and government 
agencies.424 Finally, observers are accepted to Science Committee, Science Committee expert 
groups, and/or Council meetings on a case-by-case application.425 Closed meetings at ICES are 
not open to observers.426  
 
ICES also allows anyone present to address the Assembly unless the Council decides 
otherwise.427 Further, admitted observers may make oral statements during a meeting and engage 
in other appropriate activities if invited by the chair.428 
 
ICES rules also stipulate that admitted observers shall comply with all rules and procedures 
applicable to other participants.429 Failure to comply may result in removal from a meeting and 
revocation of observer status.430 Observers may not insist on alterations or edits to the meeting 
report and cannot not make minority statements in the report.431 The Secretariat may routinely—
“with regular interval/every five years”—ask confirmed observers to confirm their continued 
wish for observer status.432 Similarly, the Secretariat may cancel observer status if the conduct of 
an observer is “inconsistent with the criteria adopted for granting observer status.433 Finally, a 
Member may request the rules be reviewed and amended.434 
 
Meetings of IPBES are called the Plenary, which observers may participate in if invited by the 
chair, but cannot vote or “join or block consensus.”435 However, IPBES does not further specify 
which meetings, if any, that observers cannot attend. The IBPES chair controls the participation 
of observers and may limit the time and number of times an observer may speak on an issue.436 
Observers and other stakeholders are also allowed to make “inputs and suggestions” concerning

the work of IPBES437 Such inputs and suggestions need to be received by the Secretariat no later 
than 6 months prior to a Plenary so that the Secretariat can compile a list and publish it to the 
website.438 The Multidisciplinary Expert Panel and the Bureau prioritize the inputs and 
suggestions.439  
 
At PICES, observers may only attend meetings of the Science Board and Finance and 
Administration Committee if the chair of the Council of the relevant Committee invites them.440 
However, unless the Council limits participation in the “meetings of any group,” any registered 
person may attend those meetings.441 Meetings of the Council and executive committees are 
closed unless that group decides to invite observers to attend.442 All registered participants to an 
Annual Meeting may attend meetings of PICES Scientific and Technical Committees and 
subsidiary bodies and participate in discussion.443 
 
It is unclear to what degree observers may participate in meetings of PICES. Registered persons 
may attend the meetings of any group unless participation is limited.444 All registered 
participants may attend meetings to participate in discussions.445 However, the draft procedures 
also note that if observer status needs to be withdrawn the chair may suspend the status subject to 
ratification of either the Bureau or the Plenary.446 Finally, observers much satisfy all conditions 
set out for observers and any relevant rules of procedure.447 
 
E. Receipt of Meeting Documents by Observers 
 
1. Multilateral Environmental Agreements 
 
The agenda for meetings and planned activities of CBD are made available on the Secretariat’s 
list of upcoming meetings.448 Official documents are provided for general distribution in all six 
UN languages.449 
 
At CITES meetings, observers receive all documents that are submitted to Parties as a whole at 
the same time that Parties receive them.450 If an observer is on a working group that has prepared

a draft document, the observer also has access to those draft documents.451 At the Standing 
Committee meetings, the Secretariat places all documents, without translation, submitted by an 
observer at the request of the chair on the website.452  
 
Observers to CMS meetings of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies generally 
obtain all documents at the same time that Parties receive them.453 Like CITES, an observer that 
is part of a working group that has prepared a draft receives those draft documents at the same 
time that Parties do.454  
 
At Montreal Protocol meetings, observers receive documentation at the same time as Parties455 
 
At UNFCCC meetings, admitted observers shall be informed by the Secretariat of the date and 
venue of any session.456 The rules do not make clear which other documents, if any, an observer 
may receive and the intense negotiations over the last five years has made it difficult to 
generalize a rule. However, draft negotiating texts as well as other documents are typically 
published on the UNFCCC website and made available to everyone at the same time.457 Other 
documents, however, such as those originating from contact groups, are not always made 
available to observers.458 
 
2. Regional Fisheries Management Organizations 
 
For CCSBT meetings, observers receive meeting reports and documents submitted to a meeting 
of the Commission, subsidiary, or advisory body at no cost.459  
 
Observers to IATTC meetings are sent, or otherwise provided, the same documentation 
generally available to Members unless a document contains business-confidential data.460 
Specifically, all background documents prepared by the Director—including the report of the 
Scientific Advisory Committee, the staff conservation recommendation, the compliance report, 
the at-sea transshipment reports, the draft annual budget, and the auditor’s report—are posted on 
the Commission’s website and circulated to observers at least 45 days before the meeting unless 
otherwise decided by the Commission and subject to applicable rules of confidentiality.461 
Finally, any proposal or relevant document that is going to be discussed at a meeting needs to be 
submitted to the Director at least 21 days before a meeting, who then posts it on the

Commission’s website without translating it.462 However, the IATTC website has a password 
protected section for distributing certain active meeting documents to delegates only.463 
 
For ICCAT meetings, the Executive Secretary sends the approved report of each meeting to 
invited observers.464 Observers now receive the same documentation as Contracting Parties 
unless the Parties have designated a document as confidential.465 Further, at the 18th Special 
Meeting, documents were distributed electronically and a single hard copy was circulated to each 
observer organization.466 This level of transparency at annual meetings has not always been the 
case and even now only the meeting agenda and logistical information for scientific meetings are 
publicly available and access to documents is password-protected.467  
 
For IOTC meetings, the Executive Secretary draws up the provisional agenda—including 
reports and documents available in connection with the Session—which is sent, after approval by 
the chair, at least 60 days before a session to the Observer Nations and Observer Associate 
Members that have attended the previous regular Session or requested to attend the next 
session.468 Similarly, other observers—including Non-member States of FAO, IGOs, and 
NGOs—also receive the provisional agenda, reports, and documents.469 
 
Observers to NAFO meetings receive documentation available to Members except documents 
considered confidential by a Member or the Executive Secretary.470 Specifically, invited 
observers receive the draft provisional agenda and the provisional agenda at least 90 days and 60 
days, respectively, before the meeting for the General Council and the Fisheries Commission.471 
Observers also receive the provisional agenda for the Scientific Council.472 Finally, as soon as 
possible after a meeting of the General Council, Fisheries Commission, or Scientific Council, 
observers are sent the summary records, reports, resolutions, recommendations, and other 
decisions adopted.473 
 
The WCPFC Secretariat is directed to distribute all documents of the Commission to 
observers.474 Before a meeting, the Executive Director sends the provisional agenda to observers

at least 90 days before a regular meeting and 25 days before a special session.475 The Executive 
Director compiles and distributes a list of proposed supplementary items for the provisional 
agenda to observers at least 20 days before the Session.476 The Executive Director also 
communicates the annual report to observers at least 45 days before the meeting.477 After a 
meeting, the Executive Director communicates the text of all decisions adopted by the 
Commission to observers within 7 days of the adoption of a decision.478 Although documents are 
generally disseminated in a timely manner, occasionally it takes months to receive the summary 
report after a meeting,479 which is made publicly available on the WCPFC’s website. Further, 
documents under discussion are generally not distributed to observers and therefore observers 
cannot comment on drafts.480  
 
3. International Scientific Organizations 
 
At ICES meetings, observers receive the same documentation as Members except for documents 
considered confidential by a Member, the chair, or the General Secretary.481 
 
 The Secretariat of IPBES distributes, in all six UN official languages, the provisional 
agenda and other official documents that are going to be considered at a session at least six 
weeks prior to the session.482 
 
 
We were unable to determine what the rules for documentation are for PICES. 
 
F. Distribution of Documents by Observers 
 
1. Multilateral Environmental Agreements 
 
At CBD meetings, observers may make available relevant information materials but may not 
distribute materials in official conference rooms.483 Those documents can only be distributed at 
designated locations and must be relevant to the negotiations and clearly marked with the 
organization’s name.484 However, other materials, including posters and other displays, relevant 
to the negotiations can only be distributed in consultation with the Secretariat at appropriate 
locations.485 Observers may also provide information documents that will be made available to 
all delegates at least six weeks before the opening of the meeting if the documents provide

background on the consideration of an agenda item but do not request or require a specific action 
if requested by a Party depending on the subject matter or issue.486  
 
CITES observers may submit informative documents “on the conservation and utilization of 
natural resources” to participants without approval if the organization offering the documents is 
clearly identified.487 If requested by the observer, the Secretariat may distribute a document to all 
meeting participants, but the document must be provided in sufficient numbers for 
distribution.488 A representative may complain to the Bureau if a distributed informative 
document is considered offensive.489 Observers may also distribute materials at their exhibits in a 
designated section of the conference building.490 Tables are also typically provided for the 
display and distribution of observer documents.491 Observers may organize side events and 
distribute documents during the event.492 
 
For the Animals Committee and Plants Committee, NGOs may provide documents through the 
“CITES Management Authority of the Party where they are located,” and recognized IGOs may 
send documents to the Secretariat.493 After receiving a submitted document, the Secretariat—in 
consultation with the chair—determines whether to distribute a document.494 Documents 
submitted to the Secretariat by a Member, alternative Member, or an observer at the request of 
the chair are placed on the website as soon as possible after receipt or no later than 10 days after 
the submission deadline.495 The Secretariat also distributes printed and translated documents to 
Members and alternate Members at least 45 days before the meeting where those issues are to be 
discussed.496 Further, the Secretariat alerts Parties of any documents that directly affect that Party 
and provides copies of documents to all Parties that request them.497 Observers may submit 
documents only for information purposes but those documents will not be translated and cannot 
be discussed at the meeting, although they can be referred to if relative to a discussion.498

CMS does not expressly prohibit or allow observers to distribute documents to Parties, but CMS 
does not limit the distribution of documents.499 An area is typically designated for observers and 
others to display exhibits and tables are provided for the distribution of observer documents.500 
Observers may organize side events and distribute documents during the event.501 
 
At Montreal Protocol meetings, observers may distribute, with clearance by the Secretariat 
documents outside meeting rooms.502 Clearance with the Secretariat is required as a 
precautionary measure to avoid distribution of information and materials that could be offensive 
or not related to the objectives of the Protocol.503 
 
UNFCCC observers may be invited to submit their views on specific issues when appropriate 
between sessions. Those documents are not official documents but are made available on the 
Secretariat’s website.504 At a meeting, only UN officials may distribute materials in official 
meeting rooms.505 However, observers may organize side-events and exhibits to provide 
information on new technologies, scientific research, mitigation or adaptation information, 
project results, and other materials.506 Observers may also display posters at designated locations 
if they have received prior permission from the Secretariat.507 During a UNFCCC meeting of the 
Conference of the Parties, observers organize dozens of side events and display large numbers of 
posters and exhibits.508 Similarly, if there is adequate space, observers may display documents at 
designated locations if they are relevant to the negotiations.509 Finally, observers should deposit 
samples of distributed documents, clearly labeled with the name of the organization, with the 
Secretariat.510 
 
2. Regional Fisheries Management Organizations

At ICCAT meetings an NGO observers may, through the Secretariat, distribute documents.517 At 
least 120 days before a meeting, NGO observers may also submit reports to the Secretariat on 
non-compliance with ICCAT conservation and management measures.518 At the 18th Special 
Meeting, NGO observers were allowed to present written statements and working papers through 
the Secretariat.519 The Secretariat determined if the content was appropriate for distribution and 
made decisions on limiting the number of statements from each observer delegate in the Biennial 
Report.520 NGO observers were also allowed to make leaflets and other information available, 
although they could not distribute such materials in the pigeonholes of delegates unless accepted 
through the Secretariat.521 The Secretariat will circulate such a report to Contracting Parties, 
Cooperating non-Contracting Parties, and Entities or Fishing Entities. An NGO that submits a 
non-compliance report may also request permission to present the report to the Compliance 
Committee and the Permanent Working Group; that request is considered when the agenda of a 
meeting is adopted.522  
 
At IOTC plenary sessions, Observer non-Member States and Observer Associate Members may 
submit memoranda while Observer IGOs, and Observers NGOs may be invited to submit 
memoranda by the Commission.523

space is often limited for distribution of observer documents.528 
 
 
PICES rules do not clearly specify whether observers may distribute documents at 
meetings.
