Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission 
Thirteenth Regular Session of the Commission (WCPFC13) 
Nadi, Fiji, 5–9 December 2016 
 
Greenpeace welcomes the opportunity to attend the 13th meeting of the Western and Central 
Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) as an observer. In addition to this paper, Greenpeace asks 
the Commission to note the statement and recommendations made to SC12 in Bali this year.1 
Building a skyscraper without foundations? 
The Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) and those who depend on its fish face a growing 
crisis. The WCPFC is failing to deliver on its most basic objectives of ensuring fisheries for future 
generations. In the worst examples, key species have been fished down to critically low levels – 
just 2.6% of the Pacific bluefin tuna, 16% of bigeye tuna, and 12% of North Pacific striped marlin 
populations remain. There is little optimism for their recovery to healthy levels in a reasonable 
timeframe given the WCPFC’s sustained track record of failing to agree adequate management 
plans and to ensure all Member and Co-operating Non-members States follow the rules. 
Unfortunately, it is clear from the positions adopted by many WCPFC Members that they show 
little interest in addressing these failures. 
Getting back to basics 
Managing the variety of tuna, billfish and shark fisheries taking place in such a vast ocean region as 
the WCPO is a complicated endeavour. As a result, WCPFC rules and the work carried out by the 
Commission are increasingly sophisticated and complex. The amount of analysis carried out by the 
different supporting institutions in the region is massive. This includes a heavy workload for 
scientists, managers and administrative staff. 
However, in contrast to this increasing complexity and workload, the basic elements required for 
successful management of fisheries in the region are absent. Over the last few years fishing 
capacity and effort have continued to increase; the analysis carried out by WCPFC Scientific (SC) 
and Technical and Compliance Committees (TCC) are plagued with references to data gaps as basic 
requirements for data provision and observer coverage are not met; and there are clearly few, if 
any, deterrents for those who fail to comply with the rules. Any progress being made fades in 
comparison with the consequences of these failures. 
Basic elements of sound fisheries management include: 
 The availability of accurate and detailed data on the operations of fishing fleets; 
 The mechanisms to ensure that fishing capacity and effort are managed effectively, 
including taking into account all factors which contribute to them; 
 Clear rules on biomass and fishing mortality limits and actions to be taken when these 
limits are exceeded; 
 Strict compliance with legal requirements, both under the Convention and International 
Law; 
2 
 Deterrent consequences for the lack of compliance with the above mentioned 
requirements; 
 Transparency in the work of the Commission, allowing engagement of all stakeholders, and 
civil society in particular. 
A lack of data undermines all levels of management 
Year after year it is clear that key data to inform the work of the Commission is either not being 
collected, or not being reported. While improvements are being made, progress is slow.  
Data gaps have three main causes: 
1. Data is not provided to the Commission despite existing obligations in that regard. This 
includes operational catch and effort data,2 transhipment practices,3 observer coverage,4 
and data on shark catches.5 
2. Data is not provided, or provided in an inconsistent manner, due to unclear provisions. 
This includes observer data6 or data on certain important species.7 Poor clarity on 
provisions critical to data collection also affects observer coverage itself (see below). 
3. Data is not provided because it is not mandatory to do so, even if such data are of critical 
importance to managing fisheries. An example of this is the lack of complete information 
on the management of fishing capacity, where accurate data are not required on most 
factors essential to assessing the efficiency of fishing vessels. 
All of this has obvious implications on the management of fish stocks under the purview of the 
Commission, and in its ability to evaluate the performance of agreed conservation and 
management measures for both target and bycatch species. 
Undermining rules and data collection 
Independent observers on board fishing vessels collect vital data for science, and detect non-
compliance for managers. Conversely, transhipment at sea undermines oversight of fisheries, and 
facilitates human rights and labour violations in some of these fisheries. 
The requirement for a minimum of 5% observer coverage on longliners has been in place since 
2007, with a deadline of implementation on 2012.8 However, even this low level is not being met9 
and there are issues with the way such coverage is defined, so that the levels reported by different 
fleets are inconsistent.10 While observer coverage on purse seiners is 100% some reporting 
problems still need to be addressed.11  
Even if the required 5% level was met, it is not considered high enough for the data collected to be 
statistically useful for assessing bycatch impacts – scientists recommend a minimum of 20% 
coverage.12 More concerning is that electronic monitoring may now be seen as a way to reach 5% 
coverage, rather than a way to complement and enhance the current requirement to a much 
higher and more scientifically useful level.13 
Finally, observer safety remains a problem in fisheries worldwide, including at WCPFC. Provisions 
agreed at WCPFC12 go some way to addressing concerns, but without the means and tools for 
observers to increase their safety, clarity on the responsibilities of flag States to deal with observer 
safety concerns, and transparency in how incidents of bribery, harassment, and violence are 
reported and dealt with, there remain considerable risks to observers and, therefore, the quality 
of data gathered by the observer programme. 
 
3 
Transhipment at sea continues to undermine the monitoring, control and surveillance of fishing 
operations in the region.14 Despite the requirement for observers aboard transport vessels to 
monitor transhipment, reporting requirements for observer data for monitoring high seas 
transhipments have not been agreed, and some data are being submitted on a voluntary basis and 
in a range of different formats.15 Existing data from transhipments indicate a failure to comply 
with the prohibition of shark-finning,16 and while transhipment plays a role, inadequate reporting 
provisions can mask shark-finning practices.17  
Although it seems to have been the intention of the Commission to restrict high seas 
transhipment,18 it allows exceptions, and it is clear that particular members are determined to 
continue to make widespread use of this. With almost half of the vessels in the region authorised 
to tranship in the high seas, WCPFC should question to what extent an activity can be considered 
‘exceptional’.19  
Transhipment also facilitates human rights and labour abuses by allowing vessels to remain at sea 
for long periods with little or no oversight or ability for crew to report concerns – an issue that 
receives increasing public scrutiny, but which WCPFC has not yet addressed. 
Lack of transparency facilitates lack of compliance 
Strict deterrent consequences for the lack of compliance by Members and Cooperating Non-
Members and their vessels are required to ensure management measures are achieved. 
Furthermore, the availability of information on how compliance is monitored, on non-compliance 
reporting, and on the actions taken to deal with those responsible, enables public evaluation and 
creates an added incentive for compliance due to a desire to avoid the adverse reputational and 
economic repercussions of breaking the rules.  
The WCPFC suffers from substantial transparency problems that prevent meaningful participation 
of the public and observers (non- and inter-governmental organisations) in its work, with resulting 
inadequate incentives for compliance.20 This recurring problem, particularly with regard to closed 
sessions during TCC meetings, has triggered a series of interventions and joint letters from NGOs 
in the recent past. This goes against the transparency requirements detailed in the Convention21 
and Rules of Procedures,22 in addition to well-established best practice at RFMOs,23 other Regional 
Fisheries Bodies, and other international environmental agreements.24 
Fishing capacity must be reduced 
The ever-increasing level of fishing capacity and effort25 in the region represents a fundamental 
failure to meet the Convention requirement to “take measures to prevent or eliminate overfishing 
and excess fishing capacity and to ensure that levels of fishing effort do not exceed those 
commensurate with the sustainable use of fishery resources.”26 
The increase in vessel numbers and other components of fishing capacity and effort in the region, 
such as FADs and their role in increasing catch rates, is a result of key decisions being left in the 
hands of private fishing companies. Recent analysis on the purse seine sector demonstrates that 
overcapacity is substantial.27 Without detailed information on fishing capacity and effort it is hard 
to ensure that fishing is kept within sustainable limits.28 
It is of great concern that after public commitments in 2009 by developed nations under the Kobe 
process29 to freeze their fishing capacity (even though poorly defined as vessel numbers), the 
WCPO fleet has continued to increase in terms of both number of vessels and vessel size,30 with 
4 
obvious implications in these fisheries.31 In the WCPO, 131 of the purse seiners and 428 of the 
longliners on the WCPFC Registered Vessel List were built after 2009.32 It is no less concerning that 
after such controversy over FADs, many basic facts on their numbers and use remain unknown. 
Appropriate data must be collected to measure and manage fishing capacity. The purse seine 
industry has successfully opposed precautionary measures on FAD use with the excuse of the lack 
of information to determine suitable measures, introducing instead so-called FAD Management 
Plans that should, at a minimum, provide the information required for informed management in 
the future. The reality is that we still lack this data33 due both to the poor design of FAD 
management plans and to their requirements not being met.34 
The result: overfishing and ecosystem impacts 
Pacific bluefin has been fished down to just 2.6% of its unfished population size35 and bigeye tuna 
to 16%.36 North Pacific striped marlin has been in a poor state for over 30 years (now at just 12%) 
with no action taken for recovery of the population.37 Some other billfish populations are also 
significantly depleted. South Pacific albacore continues to decline,38 and the persistently low and 
declining average catch rates are likely to continue to undermine vessel profitability and may force 
some operators out of the fishery.39  
Again, and in contravention to the precautionary approach enshrined in the WCPFC convention,40 
insufficient data is often cited as an excuse for further delaying the already slow process of 
agreeing harvest strategies for target species, and often by members who are failing to meet their 
own data requirements. However, the continuing failure of the WCPFC to agree adequate 
measures without the pre-agreed goals and rules of harvest strategies means that further delaying 
this process is a continued threat to fish stocks.41 
Oceanic whitetip shark42 and silky shark43 populations have been devastated by both longliners 
and purse seiners, and not enough data is available to assess other key shark species.44 Meanwhile 
WCPFC parties continue to resist developing even the most basic Shark Management Plans. 
Threatened albatrosses, petrels, and sea turtles continue to be killed as best-practice bycatch 
mitigation measures are still not in place and, again, observer coverage and reporting 
requirements are not good enough to collect accurate data on these species. 
WCPFC must address urgent data and compliance issues 
The following list encompasses priorities that must be addressed to ensure that further work by 
the SC and TCC, and measures developed by WCPFC, will not continue to be undermined.  
Greenpeace calls on the Commission to:  
 Strengthen mandatory reporting requirements to ensure that fishing capacity and effort in 
all tuna, billfish, and shark fisheries are adequately measured and reported, so as to allow 
for the best performance of the SC and a sound basis for Conservation and Management 
Measures. 
 
Impose deterrent sanctions for cases of non-compliance to ensure that States comply 
with all their data reporting requirements, such as No Data, No Fishing measures of the 
type recently agreed at the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC).45 
 
Improve transparency and compliance by removing barriers to NGO and IGO observer 
access to the compliance monitoring processes, and relevant documents and meetings. 
5 
 
Require a clearly-defined, representative 20% observer coverage on longline fleets. Where 
human on-board observers are not feasible for certain fleets or vessel sizes other 
alternatives, such as electronic monitoring systems, must be assessed and put in place 
subject to minimum technical requirements that ensure the reliability of the system. These 
must not prevent the much needed increase in human observer coverage, starting with 
ensuring that existing obligations are met. 
 Ensure the health and safety of all observers by developing robust safety and security 
measures, and transparent reporting mechanisms for infractions and actions taken against 
any operators or crew members that harass, intimidate, harm, or in any way prevent 
observers from performing their duties. 
 Improve and align vessel databases and the information fields they contain to ensure good 
data availability for capacity assessment. 
 Phase out all transhipment at sea. In the interim, all transhipment must have observers on 
board both the fishing and carrier vessels. Any violation detected in transhipment must 
result in the loss of transhipment authorisation. 
 Consider FADs in context of capacity management, and prioritise the collection of data on 
the number of FADs and the associated technology used, and abandoned or lost, by 
vessels, in order to assess effort creep associated with FAD use and their impacts on 
juvenile tuna and shark populations. 
 Develop measures to improve the quality and quantity of data recorded and reported for 
all sharks caught (including mobula and manta rays), including details of the species, gear 
types used, and the condition of each animal on release (dead, injured, alive). This must 
include a requirement that all sharks are landed with their fins naturally attached. Failure 
to report on shark catches should result in a ban on using shark-specific gear and on 
retention of sharks. 
 Adopt the tiered approach to the development of shark management plans by all States as 
recommended by the paper presented at SC and TCC.46
