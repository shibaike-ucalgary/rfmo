Dear Mr. Wright, 
 
The resolution on tuna conservation adopted by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission 
(IATTC) at its annual meeting in June 2009 includes a paragraph regarding cooperation between 
the IATTC and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), which reads as 
follows: 
 
“The Director shall continue efforts to promote compatibility between the conservation and 
management measures adopted by IATTC and WCPFC in their goals and effectiveness, 
including by frequent consultations with his counterpart in WCPFC, so that they can maintain, 
and inform their respective organizations of, a thorough understanding of conservation and 
management measures directed at bigeye, yellowfin, and other tunas, and the scientific bases and 
effectiveness of those measures.” 
 
Thus, the IATTC clearly recognizes the importance of cooperating closely with the WCPFC in 
establishing complementary conservation and management measure for species of mutual 
interest. I trust that the members of the WCPFC will take this into consideration in their 
deliberations on conservation and management measures for the WCPFC region. 
 
I would appreciate it if you would circulate this letter to the WCPFC members during your 
annual meeting in Tahiti. 
 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
 
  
 
 
Guillermo Compeán 
Director
