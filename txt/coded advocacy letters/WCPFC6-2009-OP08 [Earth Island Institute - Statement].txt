Earth Island is pleased to attend this meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Tuna 
Commission. 
 
Our organization is responsible for developing and verifying Dolphin Safe tuna around the world.  
This Commission has a major role to play in maintaining viable tuna stocks while protecting species 
including dolphins and whales by promoting Dolphin Safe fishing practices. 
 
We are pleased that this Commission has adopted closures to protect tuna stocks in the Western 
and Central Pacific.  These closures should be long enough to provide significant, scientifically-based 
protection to all tuna stocks. 
 
Furthermore, we believe that time and/or area closures can provide a means to reduce bycatch of 
non-target species, such as sharks, billfish, sea turtles and other species, while allowing fishermen to 
continue to harvest tuna at sustainable levels.  We encourage the Commission to take steps to experiment 
with such closures to ensure protection for the ocean ecosystem.
