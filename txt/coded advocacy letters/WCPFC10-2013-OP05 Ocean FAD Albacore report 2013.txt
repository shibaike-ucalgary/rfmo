Ocean FAD Report on Coastal Albacore Troll Fishery aboard  
F/V OCEAN JOY, 2013 
 
 
 
For the past 12 years, IUU driftnet vessels have been targeting on North Pacific Albacore. 
These are the same tuna stocks that are caught by US and Canadian West Coast artesian 
Albacore “Troll and Pole” fishers.  This fish proves it.  
 
Albacore tuna is a migratory species that travel from the coast of Japan to the U.S. and 
Canadian west coast seasonally.  IUU driftnet fishing conducted in the north western 
Pacific Ocean stops this migratory pattern, not only for the albacore, but for all sea 
creatures such as dolphins, turtles and whales. Why is there is no protection? 
 
July 13, 2013:  F/V Ocean Joy departed Monterey Bay setting out for the Albacore fishing 
grounds.  Aboard is Captain John-Boy Harder and new observer and crewmember Kristy 
Faure, who is taking photos and documenting our season. 
  
July 24, 2013: Our position is approximately 44.38 North/125.55 West. Around 80 miles 
west of Newport Oregon, which just happens to be the new HQ of NOAA.  By this time 
we have observed that two out of ten fish brought aboard have marks or scratches made 
by driftnets. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
August 28th we returned to Westport for unloading and crew change. We returned to the 
sea on September 1st and headed south again. This time all the way to Eureka, Northern 
CA. We found driftnet scratched fish there too. 40.35 N x 125.32 W on the 4th of 
September. 
 
 
 
On September 6th we headed north all the way into Canadian waters. By September 15th, 
we found ourselves off of Vancouver Island, and caught this fish with gill net imbedded 
in it’s body. Everywhere we fished, we had a sign of IUU driftnet activity. 
 
 
 
In conclusion, IUU driftnet fishing continues to target albacore tuna in competition with 
local west coast sustainable “Troll & Pole” fisheries. Enforcement agencies could stop 
this illegal fishing anytime, but choose not to act.  
 
Recommendations to the WCPFC10: 
�
Required VMS on all fishing vessels in the WCPFC exempt area north of 20%N & 
west of 175%E, as agreed upon at NC8, starting on January 1st,2014. 
�
Ban all transshipping for Long Line vessels. If transshipping continues, mandatory 
100% observer coverage on both LL vessels and carrier ships. 
�
Any vessel caught fishing & or transshipping out of compliance be put on IUU list 
with no exceptions. 
�
Heavy fines for IUU vessel owners & flag states. 
 
High Seas Driftnets were to be banned by the United Nations in 1993. Why they still 
thrive today can only be on account of  greed.
