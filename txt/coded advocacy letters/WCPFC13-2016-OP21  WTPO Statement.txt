WTPO Statement  WCPFC-13 
 
 
The World Tuna Purse Seine Organization (WTPO) members, who are your partners in 
developing the tuna fishery so that this God given resource is utilized in an efficient and 
sustainable way, would like to express their concern on the following issues: 
 
1)  Fishing Capacity Control  
 
WTPO continue to support capacity control, with no exemption, in the convention area and in all 
oceans and the need to establish a capacity transfer arrangement in response to the aspirations of 
SIDS to develop their respective fishery.   
 
2)  Definition of Fish Aggregate Device(FAD) 
 
WTPO requests the WCPFC to review the current definition of Fish Aggregate Device (FAD) and 
consider the adoption of the IATTC definition of Fish Aggregate Device (FAD) in order to prevent 
any misunderstanding to a legal fishing activity and/or unnecessary arguments between fishing 
operator and observer on board. 
 
*IATTC FAD Definition 
“Fish-Aggregating Device” (FAD) means anchored, drifting, floating or submerged objects 
deployed and/or tracked by vessels, including through the use of radio and/or satellite buoys, for 
the purpose of aggregating target tuna species for purse-seine fishing operations.

3) Vessel Crew and Observer Concerns and Issues 
 
While observers on board purse seine vessels have played significant roles in the management of 
the fishery there is a need to address issues on individual differences, misbehaviors and 
misunderstanding of rules that can lead to misreporting and the need to act on every incident in a 
timely manner. WTPO would like to propose the creation of a working group within the 
Commission and work with vessel operators in order to establish a mechanism of reporting and 
action on reports taking into consideration the welfare of the observer as well as the right of the 
fishermen and the authority of the licensing State as well as the responsibility of the Flag State.
