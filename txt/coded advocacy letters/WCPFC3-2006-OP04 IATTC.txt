Dear Mr. Wright: 
You asked recently for comments about the IATTC experience with measures to restrict fishing 
effort to conserve tuna stocks in the eastern Pacific Ocean.  I have prepared an outline of the 
measures adopted by the IATTC since 1966, which may be useful in your preparations for your 
meeting. 
The IATTC successfully used a closure of the purse-seine fishery in the Commission’s 
Yellowfin Regulatory Area (CYRA) from 1966 to 1979, and subsequently with similar measures 
during 1998 - 2001.   For a period between 1980 and 1985 it was not possible to reach agreement 
on the implementation of conservation measures, and during 1986 to 1997 conservation 
measures were not necessary.  The closure allowed fishing to continue within the CYRA for 
other species so long as the catch of yellowfin did not exceed 15% of the total. 
The closure of the CRYA for purse-seine fishing for yellowfin was a successful measure 
because: 
• 90% of the yellowfin catch was  taken by purse-seine, 
• fishing outside the CYRA caught large yellowfin, catches of which had a relatively small 
impact the stock, 
• purse-seine fishing that targeted skipjack was not affected by the closure. 
In 1998, the IATTC introduced its first measure to control purse-seine catches of bigeye tuna by 
prohibiting sets on floating objects after 45,000 t of bigeye had been taken (Resolution C-98-05).  
A similar measure was adopted in 1999 (Resolution C-99-06), and provisionally for 2000 
(Resolution C-99-09). 
However, there was a very strong recruitment of bigeye in 1998 producing very large catches in 
2000 which would have lead to the fishery on floating objects being closed in the middle of the 
year, with very serious repercussion of the catches of skipjack.  Eventually, the Commission 
 
closed the fishery on floating objects from 15 September to 15 December 2000 (Resolution C-
00-02). 
During the brief period that management measures had been adopted for bigeye tuna two 
difficulties arose.  The first was in determining in advance the appropriate TAC for bigeye.  This 
was particularly important because purse-seine catches bigeye were taken as a minor catch in 
sets on floating objects.  While stopping fishing for bigeye too early may not have been serious 
from the point of view of catches of bigeye, it would have been a more serious issue if skipjack 
catches were curtailed unnecessarily.   
The objectives of management measures for bigeye tuna and the means of achieving them have 
varied.  The initial concern, during the 1990s, with purse-seine catches of bigeye on FADs was 
that the fishery particularly selected small bigeye tuna. The Commission tended to equate purse-
seine caught bigeye with small or immature bigeye, and restrictions were aimed at reducing all 
purse-seine catches.  However, in 2000, the bigeye taken by purse-seine vessels were medium 
sized indicating the fishery could catch a wider range of sizes than hitherto thought. In 2001, the 
bigeye closure was modified to be triggered by the estimated catch of bigeye less than 60cm 
(Resolution C-01-06).  There was also an emerging problem in monitoring sets on floating 
objects.  Even with vessels carrying an observer, there was a trend for the vessel to make sets 
including, or near floating objects, and to claim there were on an unassociated school. 
In addition, the use of FADs, which were spread throughout the fishery started to produce 
catches of small bigeye and, to a lesser extent, yellowfin outside the CYRA.  A CYRA closure 
was not effective for bigeye, and its rational for yellowfin was weakened. 
As a result of these issues, the management measures for purse-seine fishing were switched from 
TAC based measures to measures to limit fishing effort.  This was particularly convenient in 
2002, when the recommended reductions in effort for bigeye and yellowfin were comparable and 
the conservation resolution for 2002 (Resolution C-02-04) simply closed the whole EPO to 
purse-seine fishing during the month of December. 
In 2003, the December closure was limited to an area of the EPO that contained a large part of 
the fishery in association with FADs shown in figure 1 below (Resolution C-03-12). 
In a subsequent analysis of the effect of the closed area, it was determined that the reduction in 
catch attributed to the closure was negligible and that, overall, the closure was ineffective (SAR-
5-06, 2004 Stock Assessment Working Group). This was because the closure was both too short, 
and the area was too small, allowing the fleet to make good catches of yellowfin and bigeye tuna 
outside the closed area. 
In 2003, it was also agreed that the fishery in all of the EPO should be closed to purse-seining 
during 1 August to 11 September 2004.  The dates for 2004 were chosen as the period in which 
there would be the greatest reduction of catches of small bigeye compared to the reduction of 
skipjack catch.  The time of the year made little difference for yellowfin catches.  The Resolution 
also required that the longline catches of bigeye tuna of each CPC be restricted to the level of 
their catch in 2001.  This was the first binding limit on longline catches in the eastern Pacific. In 
fact, in 2004 there was a debate about the most appropriate period for a closure and in the event 
 
 
two six-week periods of closure were adopted, the second one being from 20 November to 31 
December, with each CPC being able to adopt one or the other for its fleet. 
An assessment of the effect of the closures in 2004 and 2005 on the number of sets of each type 
at the 2006 Stock Assessment Review Group (SAR-7-12) showed that the there was not a 
consistent reduction fishing effort  in fishing effort in 2004 and 2005 compared to 2003.  This 
was in part due to the growth of the purse-seine fleet, and also because many vessels scheduled 
their normal maintenance, when they would not have been fishing anyway, during the closure 
period. 
The six-week closures were applied from 2004-2006 (Resolution C-04-09), and subsequently 
extended to 2007 (Resolution C-06-02.)  The Resolutions also provided specific catch limits for 
bigeye taken by longline for China, Chinese Taipei, Japan, and Korea and required other CPCs to 
limit their catches to those of 2001.  For 2007, that was changed to the maximum of 500t or their 
catch in 2001. 
I hope this assists you in your work of providing advice for your Commission. 
Yours sincerely, 
 
Robin Allen
