Dear WCPFC Member, Participating Territory, Cooperating Non-member, or Observer,  
 
I am writing on behalf of the Pew Environment Group, in regards to the discussions that will take place at the 
upcoming 7th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Commission (WCPFC) in Honolulu, Hawaii.  As 
the newest and largest RFMO responsible for managing highly migratory fish stocks, the WCPFC has the ability 
to apply current “best-practice” in fisheries management so that tuna, sharks and other fisheries under its 
remit are assured a well managed future, and can thus continue to provide income and benefits to the 
countries of the Pacific. 
 
However, we believe that for this to happen, all members, cooperating non-members and participating 
territories (CCMs) must ensure that WCPFC decision making does not follow the same path as other RFMOs in 
other regions.  This 7th Regular Session offers an opportunity to: ensure strong Conservation and Management 
Measures (CMMs) are in place and effectively implemented; implement scientifically sound, precautionary 
measures to protect the ecological and economic viability of tuna and shark populations and the ecosystems 
on which they depend; and ensure that progress is made toward implementation of port State measures to 
reduce and eventually eliminate illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing. 
 
In the attached policy brief we outline our key areas of interest and concern, and accompanying this letter are 
several documents providing information and analysis for your perusal and consideration: 
 
 
The overall Pew Policy Brief for the 7th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Commission 
(WCPFC) 
 
The results of our research on Port State Performance and  WCPFC-specific findings of a recent Gap 
Analysis comparing port State measures developed by ten RFMOS and the FAO Port State Measures 
Agreement  
We look forward to working with you and your delegation in Honolulu to progress sustainable fisheries in the 
Pacific through conservation of shark and tuna populations and progress towards elimination of IUU fishing. 
Please feel free to contact us at international@pewtrusts.org, now or during the meeting, if we may be of any 
assistance.

Executive Summary  
The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) is the newest and largest Regional 
Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO) responsible for managing highly migratory fish stocks. It 
arguably is the best equipped to create a sustainable future for a large proportion of the world’s 
commercial fish populations.  Given its more modern and comprehensive mandate, the WCPFC has 
the ability to apply current international best practices in fisheries management so that the tuna, 
sharks and other fisheries under its remit do not follow the same path as those managed by RFMOs 
in other regions. WCPFC can instead chart a course towards a sustainable future.   
Members, cooperating non-members and participating territories (CCMs) involved in the 
development of bilateral treaties related to fisheries access in the Convention Area must ensure that 
any such treaties are complementary to and supportive of strong, science-based management with 
appropriate limits and enforcement measures.   
The WCPFC has an opportunity at this 7th Regular Session to ensure the implementation of strong 
and effective conservation management measures (CMMs). These measures should be scientifically 
sound and precautionary and should protect the ecological and economic viability of tuna and shark 
populations and the ecosystems on which they depend.  Specifically, the Pew Environment Group 
recommends that WCPFC takes the actions outlined below. 
To help ensure the conservation of shark populations:    
 
Prohibit purse seine vessels from setting nets around whale sharks, a species classified by the 
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as Vulnerable to extinction. 
 
Approve the Shark Research Plan and the associated budget to determine the status of key shark 
species. 
 
Add sharks to the Commission rules on scientific data to require shark reporting and improve 
estimates on annual catches, effort and discards. 
 
Prohibit the removal of shark fins at sea by requiring that fins be naturally attached on landing 
 
Prohibit the use of wire leadersi in order to reduce bycatch. 
 
Make all portions of the Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks (CMM 2009-04) 
mandatory. 
 
Include hammerhead and porbeagle sharks among the key shark species identified in CMM 
2009-04, and also include other species at highest risk from longline and purse seine fishing, 
such as those identified in the Pacific Islands Regional Plan of Action (PI-RPOA):  blacktip, 
salmon, silvertip, sandbar and Galapagos sharks, as well as the pelagic stingray. 
 
Require the release of all live sharks. 
 
Prohibit the dumping of carcasses after landing.  
 
 
                                                             
i Longline gear consists of a main line suspended by floats with branch lines.  Leaders, or traces, are the portion of the 
branchline before the hook. Heavy-duty nylon monofilament is often used for the leader, but wire is sometimes used as 
well.  The catch rates of sharks are significantly higher on wire than on nylon leaders. Sharks are better able to sever or 
break the nylon leader, thus reducing shark bycatch.  
4 FINDING SUSTAINABILITY 
 
To help ensure the conservation of tuna populations:    
 
Manage stocks with a higher degree of precaution, particularly bigeye tuna, given high 
uncertainty with regard to recruitment levels.1  As a precautionary action, measures should be 
implemented to reduce fishing mortality of bigeye by at least 39% from 2005-2008 levels, in 
order to include a 10% precautionary buffer on top of the 29% reduction proposed by the 
Scientific Committee at its 6th Regular Session (SC6). 
 
Further extend the fish aggregating device (FAD) closure and fully enforce it. Significantly extend 
the FAD closure to ensure increased effectiveness or establish a limit on the number of total FAD 
sets allowed throughout the year based on advice from the Scientific Committee. Implement 
reporting and monitoring provisions and keep them under active review. 
 
Identify and correct non-compliance, particularly for negligent or late data reporting.  A lack of 
timely data provision continues to hamper the ability of the Scientific Committee to provide the 
highest quality management recommendations.   
To address illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing:  
 
Seek to improve WCPFC port State Measures (PSMs), with the goal of bringing them into line 
with the recently adopted Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA).ii  By adopting an improved 
PSM regime, WCPFC CCMs not only would reduce IUU fishing in the WCPFC Area but would also 
support global efforts to close ports to all IUU fishing vessels. 
 
Encourage WCPFC CCMs to sign and ratify the PSMA as soon as possible. 
 
Require fishing and support vessels authorized to operate in the Convention Area to have a 
unique IMO (International Maritime Organization) number to allow the identification and 
tracking of these vessels. 
 
Ensure that CCMs are implementing their Convention obligations and conservation and 
management measures by adopting a compliance monitoring scheme.   
 
Support the continued closures of the high seas pockets and the additional closures proposed by 
the PNA.

Overcoming Challenges: Towards Sustainability 
 
The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission was established by the Convention for the 
Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific 
Ocean, and entered into force on June 19, 2004. The WCPFC aims to ensure the long-term 
conservation and sustainable use of highly migratory fish stocks in the Western and Central Pacific 
Ocean while also reflecting the unique social, economic and geographic characteristics of the region. 
Mirroring many of the provisions of the U.N. Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA), iii the WCPFC has a 
mandate to use precautionary and ecosystem-based approaches to management, to make decisions 
based on the best scientific information available and to minimize bycatch and protect biodiversity.   
The WCPFC is the newest and largest RFMO responsible for managing highly migratory fish stocks 
and arguably is the best-equipped to create a sustainable future for a large proportion of the world’s 
commercial fish populations.   Accounting for nearly 20% of the earth’s surface, the WCPFC is 
responsible for management of the world’s largest tuna fishery and important populations of sharks, 
as well as marine turtles and many other commercially and ecologically important species.   With 
almost 60% of the world’s tuna originating from the waters of the western and central Pacific2, tunas 
are critical to the livelihoods of Pacific peoples and States. The developing countries of the Pacific, 
whose waters are home to these species, should receive equitable benefits from the sustainable 
harvesting of fish. In addition, they need capacity building support to facilitate sustainable 
management and enforcement capabilities. In this regard, the effects of IUU fishing, in particular 
unregulated fishing and the under-reporting of catch, also need to be addressed.  
 At the global level, despite efforts by the 18 RFMOs and individual States to manage fisheries, a 
2010 peer-reviewed evaluation of RFMO performance determined that two-thirds of stocks fished 
on the high seas and under RFMO management are either depleted or overexploited.3 Similarly, 
according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO):  ‘‘In the case of straddling stocks and 
of other high seas fishery resources, nearly two-thirds of the stocks for which the state of 
exploitation can be determined were classified as overexploited or depleted.”4 Further, more than 
one-half of the shark species taken in high seas fisheries are classified by the IUCN Red List as 
                                                             
iii U.N. Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea of Dec.10, 1982. 
Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. Entered into 
force on Dec. 11, 2001. www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_fish_stocks.htm and

“Pacific Island Fisheries are the major renewable resource available to the region 
for food security, livelihoods and economic growth. Despite considerable progress 
in fisheries management and development, many of these fisheries face collapse 
over the next 25 years and major development opportunities will be missed unless 
strategic action is taken.”

Threatened or Near Threatened. These data confirm that RFMOs are not sustainably managing the 
high seas fisheries for which the global community holds them accountable. The challenge to the 
WCPFC is to defy this trend and chart a course towards a sustainable future. 
Given its more modern and comprehensive mandate, the WCPFC has the ability to apply current 
international best practice in fisheries management so that the tuna, sharks and other fisheries 
under its remit do not follow the same path as those managed by RFMOs in other regions. In this 
regard, the WCPFC has an opportunity in 2010 to ensure that strong and effective CMMs are in place 
and effectively implemented by CCMs. It also has the opportunity to implement scientifically sound, 
precautionary measures to protect the ecological and economic viability of tuna and shark 
populations and the ecosystems on which they depend. 
Many member countries of the WCPFC have been operating under bilateral and multilateral access 
agreements with one or more Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) to ensure access for their tuna 
fleets.  Some of these agreements are being renegotiated as we speak.  While some of these 
agreements could contain more effective conservation measures than have been agreed by the 
Commission, others could contain measures that would be obstacles to progress by the 
Commission.  It is important that access agreements are not obstacles to the agreement or 
implementation of conservation and management measures.  Sustainability must be mainstreamed 
into all access agreements.  In order to increase the effectiveness of the WCPFC and its primary role 
of managing and conserving tuna and other fisheries under its remit, the Pew Environment Group 
encourages the Commission to integrate these agreements into the Commission’s processes.   In this 
regard, we would encourage parties to consider including provisions from the PSMA and a greater 
attention to the conservation and management of sharks, both in these access agreements and the 
WCPFC provisions as a whole.    
At this 7th Regular Session of the WCPFC, there are opportunities to create a new era of 
sustainability.  Although the capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change challenge these 
opportunities, the adoption of strong precautionary conservation and management measures by 
WCPFC CCMs can help mitigate these challenges.  This Session provides a launching point for 
regional progress and long-term strategic action, which can be achieved only through strong political 
commitments with effective implementation thereafter. This document sets out the Pew 
Environment Group’s recommended actions on:  1) critical conservation management actions 
needed for sharks; 2) tuna conservation; and 3) reduction of IUU fishing. We look forward to 
providing scientific and technical information and working closely with States to help ensure 
sustainable, legal fisheries and healthy populations of tunas, sharks and other species for the benefit 
of all.  
 
 
 
 
 
7 FINDING SUSTAINABILITY 
 
1. Conservation Measures Needed to Protect Sharks 
1.1 Sharks Need Attention Now 
Sharks caught in high seas fisheries are among the 
oceans’ most vulnerable animals. Their low 
reproductive rates make them particularly susceptible 
to overfishing in the face of increased demand for 
shark products. Up to 73 million sharks are killed 
annually to support the global shark fin trade.5 More 
than one-half of the shark species taken in high seas 
fisheries are classified by the IUCN Red List as 
Threatened or Near Threatened.6 
In 2010, the international community focused much 
attention on the plight of sharks.  In March, at the 
15th meeting of the Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Conference of 
the Parties, four Appendix II listing proposals narrowly 
missed receiving the number of votes required to give 
these species the protections to help ensure sustainable international trade.  In May, the resumed 
Review Conference of the U.N. Fish Stocks Agreement called on countries to implement “fins 
naturally attached” provisions. 
However, as 2010 draws to a close, there are still virtually no international limits on high seas shark 
catches, and loopholes still hamper the enforcement of international prohibitions on “finning” – the 
wasteful and cruel practice of slicing off a shark’s fins and discarding the body at sea.  
As sharks are among the most biologically vulnerable fish in the ocean and little is currently known 
about their population status, the Pew Environment Group believes shark fishing should not occur in 
the absence of scientific population assessments and precautionary management plans. Further, 
WCPFC and its CCMs should prohibit the landing of exceptionally biologically vulnerable sharks, as 
well as those that that the IUCN classifies as Threatened or Near Threatened with extinction by the 
IUCN.  Ecological risk assessments can inform those measures in the absence of stock assessments.   
Finally, sharks are essential to the health of ocean ecosystems and the economies of countries, 
including those that offer marine recreation such as diving and snorkeling. For these reasons coastal 
countries should consider creating shark sanctuaries –where no commercial shark fishing is 
permitted–to protect sharks in their exclusive economic zones (EEZs).  
1.2 Shark Bycatch: Part of the Problem 
According to the IUCN, bycatch is one of the most devastating threats facing sharks.  At the Kobe II 
Bycatch Workshop7 earlier this year, participants supported presenting a number of 
recommendations to RFMOs for sharks and other bycatch species. The recommendations include 
the following:

8 FINDING SUSTAINABILITY 
 
 
“For populations of concern including those evaluated as depleted, RFMOs should develop and 
adopt immediate, effective management measures, for example, prohibition as appropriate on 
retention of such species where alternative effective sustainability measures are not in place.” 
 
“*RFMOs should+ seek binding measures or strengthen existing mitigation measures, including 
the development of mandatory reporting requirements for bycatch... across all gear types and 
fishing methods where bycatch is a concern.” 
 
“Due to the conservation status of certain populations and in accordance with priorities in the 
RFMO areas, [RFMOs should] expedite action on reducing bycatch of threatened and 
endangered species.” 
Whether unintended, unwanted or highly sought after, shark bycatch and the impact of shark 
removals on ecosystem stability needs urgent attention.  
1.3 Action Needed From WCPFC 
The WCPFC has taken initial action to conserve Pacific sharks, including CMM 2009-04, which 
mandates that vessels adhere to a 5% fin-to-carcass weight ratio for sharks and encourages the live 
release of incidental catches of sharks, among other useful measures.  However, stronger, more 
meaningful conservation measures are needed now by WCPFC and its CCMs to ensure that targeted 
fishing as well as bycatch does not deplete shark species and drive them toward extinction.  
The WCPFC and its CCMs should adopt and implement guidelines from the Pacific Islands Regional 
Plan of Action for sharks (PI-RPOA), which was completed in October 2009 by the Forum Fisheries 
Agency (FFA), the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) and the South Pacific Regional 
Environment Programme (SPREP).  The PI-RPOA provides guidance to Pacific Island Countries and 
Territories as well as the WCPFC on the conservation and management of sharks.   
Specifically, the Pew Environment Group recommends that CCMs adopt the following measures to 
help ensure the conservation of shark populations under WCPFC’s management purview:    
 
Prohibit purse seine vessels from setting nets around whale sharks, a species the IUCN classified 
as Vulnerable to extinction. 
 
Approve the Shark Research Plan and the associated budget to determine the status of key shark 
species. 
 
Add sharks to the Commission rules on scientific data to require shark reporting and improve 
estimates on annual catches, effort and discards. 
 
Prohibit the removal of shark fins at sea by requiring that fins be naturally attached on landing; 
 
Prohibit the use of wire leaders in order to reduce bycatch. 
 
Make all portions of the Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks (CMM 2009-04) 
mandatory. 
 
Include hammerhead and porbeagle sharks among the key shark species identified in CMM 
2009-04, and also include other species at highest risk from longline and purse seine fishing, 
such as those identified in the PI-RPOA:  blacktip, salmon, silvertip, sandbar, and Galapagos 
sharks, as well as the pelagic stingray. 
 
Require the release of all live sharks. 
 
Prohibit the dumping of carcasses after landing.

2. A Return to Healthy Tuna Stocks  
2.1 FADs and Juvenile Bigeye Bycatch 
The most significant threat to 
sustainability in the WCPFC tuna 
fisheries is the inability of the purse 
seine fishery to significantly reduce the 
mortality of juvenile bigeye tuna when 
setting on floating objects.  Provisional 
2009 bigeye tuna catches of 118,675 
metric tons (mt) exceeded the 
maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of 
73,840 mt by 61%.8 Extreme 
overfishing is now occurring, and the 
stock may already be in an overfished 
state.  Additionally, the spawning 
potential of bigeye tuna is now down to 
17% of unfished levels.9 As in other 
RFMOs, it appears that management 
advice is being repeatedly ignored while the status of the stocks spirals towards collapse.    
A number of recommendations on tuna, shark and other bycatch species management were 
supported by participants in the Kobe II Bycatch Workshops to present to RFMOs.  The challenge of 
juvenile bigeye bycatch is clearly a concern shared by CCMs, as evidenced by the amount of research 
on potential solutions.  In the past year alone, research on acoustic identification techniques, 
underwater monitoring systems, escape panels, and light stimuli has been undertaken by a variety of 
CCMs, but no conclusive solutions have been identified. Although more research will always be 
needed, significant action must be taken immediately to alleviate fishing pressure on this imperiled 
stock, based on what is known today.  There is one very simple and effective solution that can be 
immediately implemented: Reduce juvenile bigeye bycatch to a level that will stop overfishing and 
allow the stocks to begin to rebuild. 
Based on the results presented at the last Scientific Committee (SC6) on the effectiveness of the FAD 
closure on reducing juvenile bycatch,10 the Pew Environment Group urges WCPFC countries to agree 
to significantly extend FAD closures or to establish a limit on the number of FAD sets allowed 
throughout the year in order to ensure a reduction in juvenile bigeye bycatch. These should be 
accompanied by robust reporting and monitoring provisions, so that the Commission has access to 
meaningful data on bycatch, the number of FADs being employed and the frequency and results of 
fishing on FADs. This information should be actively reviewed. 
2.2 Fishing Beyond MSY  
To ensure that WCPFC does not mirror the decades of mismanagement seen in at least one other 
tuna RFMO, it is critical that WCPFC countries reach agreement on how to effectively reduce 
capacity to a level in line with the sustainable take of tuna resources in the Convention Area.

10 FINDING SUSTAINABILITY 
 
Information from the WCPFC Scientific Committee indicates that skipjack purse seine catches 
continue to soar.  In 2009, purse seine catches were approximately 500,000 metric tons (mt) beyond 
the long-term MSY of 1,350,000mt–a record tonnage for the region.11(See Table 1) Likewise, the 
effort that this record number of vessels exerts on the resource already exceeds the long-term 
sustainable take for skipjack.  The complex problem of overcapacity is a challenge that WCPFC 
countries must tackle immediately, before fishing pressure on the skipjack fishery reaches dangerous 
levels. Further, purse seine fishery’s high level of bigeye bycatch is a primary factor in driving the 
bigeye population towards collapse. It must be noted also that MSY is now widely recognized as an 
absolute minimum below which fishing should not continue.  
The Pew Environment Group urges CCMs to modify CMM2008-01 to reflect the most recent science 
from the SPC, and to put precautionary caps on catches of all tuna species until scientifically sound 
“limit” and “target” reference points have been identified.  
2.3 High Seas Pocket Closures 
The High Seas Closures to Purse Seine Fishing Vessels, as proposed by the PNA, provide a clear and 
concrete opportunity for the WCPFC to follow scientific advice through precautionary measures, 
thereby conserving tuna and other species, and combating IUU fishing.   The PNA proposal follows 
advice from the Scientific Committee on the need for additional measures to conserve bigeye tuna 
(see further below).   Keeping the existing areas closed, and closing these additional areas to fishing 
not only provides protection for marine life between the rich fishing grounds of the surrounding 
EEZs, it also helps stop IUU fishing and reduce the problem of additional “invisible” overfishing 
efforts.  These closures reinforce other efforts by the WCPFC for the conservation and management 
of important tuna and other fish in the Convention Area, as well as helping ensure that Pacific Island 
Countries are not cheated out of income as fish caught within EEZ’s may be falsely disguised as high 
seas catch to avoid payment of access fees.  The Pew Environment Group encourages CCMs to 
support the additional closures proposed by the PNA. 
2.4 Regional Tuna Fisheries and Climate Change 
Among its myriad impacts, climate change has the potential to impact regional tuna fisheries in 
major ways by shifting species distribution, productivity and abundance, raising average ocean 
surface temperatures, changing the productivity of the oceans, changing currents and upwellings 
and increasing climate variability.iv Although research is ongoing, there are indications that the 
adverse impacts of climate change on tuna fisheries will be pervasive. Given the importance of tuna 
fisheries to the CCMs and the potential adverse effects of climate change on this resource, it is of 
critical importance that a precautionary approach is taken and strong conservation and management 
measures are adopted.   
2.5 Action Needed From WCPFC 
Specifically, the Pew Environment Group recommends that CCMs adopt the following measures to 
help ensure the conservation of tuna populations under WCPFC’s management purview:    
                                                             
iv See for instance D.E.J. Currie and K. Wowk, “Climate Change and CO2 in the Oceans and Global Oceans Governance: 
Improving Governance of the World's Oceans, “ 4 CCLR (2009) 387 and Allison Perry et al., “Climate change and 
distribution shifts in marine fishes”, 308 Science (2005) 1912. 
11 FINDING SUSTAINABILITY 
 
 
 
Manage stocks with a higher degree of precaution, particularly bigeye given high uncertainty 
with regard to recruitment levels.12 As a precautionary action, measures should be implemented 
to reduce fishing mortality of bigeye by at least 39% from 2005-2008 levels, which includes a 
10% precautionary buffer on top of the 29% reduction proposed by SC6.v   
 
Significantly extend FAD closures or establish a limit on the number of FAD sets allowed 
throughout the year based on advice from the Scientific Committee, together with robust 
reporting and monitoring provisions. 
 
Identify and correct non-compliance, particularly for negligent or late data reporting.  A lack of 
timely data provision continues to hamper the ability of the Scientific Committee to provide the 
highest quality management recommendations.

3. Port State Measures to combat IUU Fishing   
3.1 Stopping IUU Fishing 
IUU fishing continues to be a matter of 
concern in the WCPFC Convention 
Area, where it can undermine 
conservation and management 
measures, inhibit stock rebuilding 
efforts, increase overfishing and 
threaten food and livelihood security 
for poor coastal communities in 
developing countries.14 IUU fishing also 
has a direct effect on competitiveness 
because it ignores labor and safety 
standards and distorts trade and 
market prices.  
The WCPFC has taken a number of 
important steps to combat IUU fishing, 
including the closure of high seas 
pockets as mentioned earlier. However, those engaged in IUU fishing activity have shown in the past 
and in other fisheries that they can quickly modify their operations to adapt to new measures.  
Therefore, it is important that individual States and the WCPFC remain vigilant to possible increases 
in IUU activity and use all available tools to combat it in the Convention Area. PSMs are an effective 
way to ensure the effective enforcement of management measures by substantially reducing the 
profitability of IUU fishing operations through denying port entry, transshipment and other services 
to IUU vessels.15  
We recognize that technical and financial assistance must be available to small island developing 
States to implement effective port State measures and advocated strongly for this during the 
negotiation and adoption of Article 21 of the PSMA – Requirements for Developing States.  In 
addition, we have and will continue to develop tools to assist developing States to assess the 
requirements of the FAO PSMA and to ratify and implement the agreement.16 
3.2 A Close Look at Port State Measures  
If well implemented, PSMs can be an efficient and cost-effective tool that can be used to combat IUU 
fishing as part of a broader set of instruments.  The Pew Environment Group is committed to 
enhancing the effectiveness of PSMs both globally and at the regional level.  We have conducted two 
studies that help explain the changes that need to take place, particularly in the framework of 
RFMOs, to improve PSMs and their implementation.  More detailed documentation about these 
studies is available at: www.pewenvironment.org/iuufishing . 
The first study concerns the performance of port States in implementing PSMs directed at RFMO 
IUU-listed vessels and shows that the current global system of port State controls has significant

loopholes, which are to the benefit of IUU operators.  Consequently, a system with greater 
transparency, accountability and global reach is needed to track these vessels and provide important 
information to port States. These data would allow them to determine whether or not these vessels 
should access their ports and, if so, how they should be dealt with once in a port. 
Specifically in the case of the WCPFC, we researched the movements of vessels included on its IUU 
vessel list after the implementation of listing procedures from February 2007 to December 2009.  
The vessels were tracked using information from publicly available databases.  Only three vessels 
were listed on the WCPFC IUU vessel list during this period, of which two vessels accounted for 16 
port visits.  All these visits were to ports in Non-Contracting Parties of the WCPFC that were not 
obliged to implement WCPFC’s PSMs.  For more information on the study please see 
www.portstateperformance.org . 
The second and still ongoing study is a gap analysis that compares the PSMs developed by 10 RFMOs 
with the minimum standards outlined in the FAO PSMA.  It identifies which aspects need to be 
further developed by RFMOs to align their measures with the new agreement.  Our preliminary 
findings indicate that the WCPFC needs to establish a more comprehensive system of port State 
controls to meet the minimum standard set out in the PSMA.  Such arrangements would provide 
standards for conducting inspections, a requirement to inspect vessels even if they are not IUU-
listed and an effective information-sharing system to improve transparency of vessels and product.  
3.3 Action Needed From WCPFC  
To address IUU fishing, the WCPFC should strengthen its CMMs in the following ways: 
1. The WCPFC should seek to improve its PSMs, with the goal of bringing them into line with the 
recently adopted PSMA.  By adopting an improved PSM regime, WCPFC CCMs would not only 
reduce IUU fishing in the WCPFC Area but would also support global efforts to close ports to all 
IUU fishing vessels.   
2. The WCPFC should encourage its CCMs to sign and ratify the PSMA as soon as possible. The 
prompt entry into force and broad implementation of this agreement is a high priority in the 
global fight to combat IUU fishing.  We recognize that this will take time and that many CCMs 
will need assistance in implementing new PSMs.  In this regard the Pew Environment Group is 
working to develop tools to assist CCMs with this process and as a first step has produced “A 
Methodology for Capacity Needs Assessment towards implementation of the Port State 
Measures Agreement”.  This report is available at www.pewenvironment.org/iuufishing. The 
Pew Environment Group stands ready to work with any State that seeks to ratify the agreement 
at an early stage. 
3. The WCPFC should require fishing and support vessels authorized to operate in the Convention 
Area to have a unique IMO number to allow the identification and tracking of these vessels.  We 
recommend that all CCMs should require that vessels flying their flags have IMO numbers 
regardless of where they are operating. 
4. The WCPFC should ensure that CCMs are implementing their Convention obligations and 
conservation and management measures by adopting a compliance monitoring scheme.  Such a 
scheme would: 
14 FINDING SUSTAINABILITY 
 
 
Assist CCMs to identify and address compliance gaps, including provision of appropriate capacity 
building. 
 
Identify aspects of conservation and management measures that may be impractical or 
ineffective. 
 
Address serious or repeated non-compliance, including appropriate remedial action. 
 
Monitor and resolve outstanding instances of non-compliance.

The Port State 
Measures Agreement 
Implementation 
Toolkit
The PSMA implementation toolkit provides a
comprehensive set of practical materials that
aim to support States to implement the UN Port 
State Measures Agreement which, once in force, 
will close ports to vessels involved in IUU fishing.
The Port State Measures Agreement 
Implementation Toolkit
Ports play a major role in the fishing industry. They give 
vessels and crews access to essential services and supplies 
and enable vessel operators to offload their catch and 
transport it to market. However, ports can also provide 
a lifeline for illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) 
fishing, an activity that undermines the very essence of 
global ocean governance, threatens the sustainable use 
of marine resources and, consequently, the social and 
economic wellbeing of the coastal communities and 
countries that depend on them.
The United Nations Agreement on Port State Measures to  
Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and 
Unregulated Fishing (Port State Measures Agreement, 
or PSMA), adopted in November 2009 by the United 
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), is an 
ambitious international agreement that aims to stop the 
use of ports by IUU fishing and support vessels. It provides 
port States with a set of highly cost-effective measures that, 
when implemented globally and effectively, will ensure 
that a country’s ports are closed to IUU fishing fleets. For 
this to be possible, particularly in the ports of developing 
countries, a comprehensive set of tools is needed to 
support the practical implementation of the Agreement.
As part of its commitment to improve ocean governance, 
the Pew Environment Group is developing the PSMA 
Implementation Toolkit. The toolkit aims to help developing 
countries identify their capacity needs, provide them with 
key information, and guide them through the most technical 
and detailed elements of the Agreement. 
The toolkit is an open and evolving set of practical 
materials, developed using on-the-ground experience. 
Input from potential users is a key element of the toolkit’s 
evolution. To achieve this, we encourage collaboration 
with national and regional authorities in the ongoing 
development of these materials. 
The first tools in the toolkit:
Capacity Needs Assessment Methodology
Implementation of the PSMA requires an adequate, 
well-trained fisheries inspectorate that has good levels 
of communication and coordination between domestic 
agencies, such as customs and port authorities, and 
cooperates with relevant regional and global bodies.
In collaboration with the Nordenfjeldske Development 
Services (NFDS), the New Partnership for Africa’s 
Development (NEPAD) and six African countries, the Pew 
Environment Group has developed a simple and robust 
methodology that can be used to determine a country’s 
specific capacity-building needs. The methodology also 
provides a platform for the development of a capacity-
building plan which, when implemented, would ensure that 
the country has adequate capacity to comply with its  
obligations under the PSMA.
The full Capacity Needs Assessment methodology report is  
available at www.pewenvironment.org/IUUfishing
The PSMA Implementation Handbook
The PSMA is an extensive instrument that provides a 
new set of technical measures to be implemented at the 
domestic and international levels. This requires greater 
coordination among countries, increased capacity in all 
relevant agencies (fisheries, customs, ports, etc), and, in 
many cases, new procedures for decision-making, vessel 
inspections and reporting, domestically, to flag States, and 
internationally.
The Pew Environment Group, in collaboration with experts 
in the field and government authorities, is currently 
producing the PSMA implementation handbook. The 
handbook will translate the PSMA’s technical and legal text 
into clear and practical tools to help government agencies 
and their enforcement personnel implement the Agreement 
effectively. 
The PSMA implementation handbook will be available in  
early 2011.
Combined IUU Vessel Database
IUU operators are skilled at disguising and hiding their  
activities and often remain undetected by port authorities.  
The Pew Environment Group’s research on Port State  
Performance documented some alarming situations in  
apparently well-regulated ports. As called for in Article 16  
of the PSMA, a global information-sharing mechanism is  
essential if domestic, regional and international authorities  
are to keep track of IUU activities.
As a first contribution, the Pew Environment Group has  
developed the combined IUU vessel database, which 
draws together all publicly available information on IUU 
vessels officially listed by Regional Fishery Management 
Organizations. On launch, the database will provide an 
up-to-date resource that will enhance information-sharing 
among relevant officials. The list will be made available 
to the International Monitoring, Control and Surveillance 
(IMCS) Network, which will host and maintain it. 
The Combined IUU vessels database will be available in  
early 2011.

The Pew Environment Group has conducted a gap 
analysis comparing the port State measures (PSMs) 
established by 10 Regional Fisheries Management 
Organizations (RFMOs) with those established 
by the United Nations Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) Agreement on Port State 
Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, 
Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (PSMA, or 
Agreement). The research assesses the extent to 
which measures adopted by these RFMOs meet 
the PSMA’s standards, and identifies those aspects 
which need to be further developed by each 
RFMO in order that their measures become aligned 
with the Agreement’s. The newly adopted PSMA 
represents an international minimum standard 
on PSMs and provides a unique opportunity to 
harmonise and strengthen Port State controls 
globally. RFMOs have a special role to play in 
this process and specifically in helping to combat 
illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing on 
the high seas.
This document presents the preliminary findings of 
this gap analysis for WCPFC, based on information 
that was publicly available up to 31 July 2010. 
We invite WCPFC’s Contracting Parties (CPs) to 
assist in refining this analysis by commenting on 
the information provided and providing additional 
information where appropriate. The preliminary 
aim of this exercise is to identify specific gaps 
in WCPFC’s conservation and management 
measures in relation to the PSMA, and make clear 
recommendations to WCPFC for improvement. The 
long-term aim is to provide information to States 
and RFMOs to help eliminate IUU fishing. A full 
report on this study, with specific conclusions and 
recommendations for each of the RFMOs analysed, 
will be released early in 2011.
Gap analysis: Comparing WCPFC’s port State measures 
with those in the FAO Agreement on Port State 
Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, 
Unreported and Unregulated Fishing  
PRELIMINARY FINDINGS
In November 2009, the FAO adopted the PSMA, 
providing a set of highly effective tools to be used 
by port States to combat IUU fishing, such as the 
designation of ports where foreign vessels may request 
entry; the prohibition of entry into port, the prohibition 
of landing, the prohibition of transshipping and the 
refusal of other port services to IUU fishing vessels; the 
carrying out of inspections in port; and the adoption of 
enforcement measures.
The Pew Environment Group strongly supports the 
earliest possible entry into force of the Agreement and 
welcomes the fact that 15 States and the European 
Union have signed it. The PSMA establishes the current 
international minimum standard on PSMs targeting IUU 
fishing, which should be followed by States even prior 
to the Agreement’s official entry into force. In addition 
to each State’s individual efforts to ratify the Agreement, 
steps should be taken within the framework of RFMOs 
to ensure that PSMs adopted in the regional context 
are adjusted to meet the new international minimum 
standard. PSMs will only be truly effective in combating 
IUU fishing if they are enforced in a uniform manner 
globally.
RFMOs and the PSMA can reinforce each other. 
Not only are RFMOs essential to the effective 
implementation of the PSMA in a regional context, 
but the PSMA, if implemented by a critical number of 
States, can support the role of RFMOs by improving 
overall compliance with RFMO conservation and 
management measures.
RichaRd caRey/Fotolia
ThE PoRT STATE MEASuRES AGREEMENT AND RFMoS
Preliminary findings of this research indicate that 
the PSMs of most RFMOs have not yet reached the 
standard contained in the PSMA. Most importantly, 
RFMOs have not comprehensively covered all IUU 
fishing activity, their PSMs are not sufficiently effective in 
deterring the IUU operators, and their requirements on 
transparency and information sharing are inadequate. 
In general, the study finds that there are several 
aspects of port State controls that are especially under-
regulated through RFMO regimes, such as the denial 
of port entry, refusal of port services, and minimum 
standards for inspections. Full implementation of the 
PSMA by States and RFMOs will significantly increase 
the feasibility of truly combating IUU fishing.

WCPFC. While this is a qualitative and not quantitative 
scale and methodology, it does provide a useful tool 
for comparative analyses between RFMOs, and for an 
independent analysis of individual RFMOs.
The study shows that RFMO measures are rarely an exact 
match of a PSMA provision. However, a comparison of the 
measures in place in the different regimes enables both 
general and specific conclusions about the current state 
of development of PSMs at the regional level. We are 
aware that RFMOs have their own particularities, and face 
challenges that make their regulatory systems, including 
PSMs, different from each other. However, in analysing 
PSMs developed by 10 different RFMOs, we have tried 
to keep our analysis as objective as possible, focusing on 
the degree of conformity of such rules with the PSMA. It is 
undeniable that IUU fishing on the high seas is a common 
challenge for all RFMOs. The more the RFMOs apply a 
common standard on PSMs, the better they will be able 
to face this challenge. The comparison conducted under 
this analysis indicates the principal steps that RFMOs 
should take if they are to reach the international minimum 
standard provided by the PSMA.
Undertaking a gap analysis: what is missing 
from RFMO rules?   
The study conducted by the Pew Environment Group 
focuses on 10 RFMOs that have adopted regulations, 
currently in force and published, that include some form 
of PSM1.  
 
In order to compare the measures adopted by each of 
the reviewed RFMOs with the PSMA’s measures, a review 
of the Agreement, including its annexes, was conducted 
and its provisions deconstructed into more than 100 
obligations. Subsequently, all potentially relevant RFMO 
measures were reviewed and those that contain PSMs 
applicable to fishing or fishing-related activities were 
compared, obligation by obligation, with the obligations 
provided by the PSMA. In order to assess the alignment 
between RFMO measures and those contained in the 
PSMA, we have taken into account the objective pursued 
by the PSMA obligation, the effect of each RFMO 
measure in its regulatory context, and the clarity of the 
RFMO measures analysed.
To facilitate communicating the results of this research, 
we have systematised our conclusions under a number 
of PSM categories. These categories correspond closely 
to the main parts of the PSMA: scope; cooperation and 
information-sharing; port-designation and prior-to-entry 
information; denial of entry and port use; inspections; 
and the role of the flag State. To illustrate the alignment 
between RFMO measures and the PSMA’s, we have 
allocated a grade from 0 to 10 showing our assessment of 
the degree of conformity on each measure. See  
Figure 1 for a representation of preliminary results for 
1  These are: Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living 
Resources (CCAMLR); Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna (CCSBT); General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM); 
Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC); International Commission 
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT); Indian Ocean Tuna Commission 
(IOTC); Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO); North East Atlantic 
Fisheries Commission (NEAFC); South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation 
(SEAFO); Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC).
According to the WCPF 
Convention, port 
States have the right 
and the duty to take 
measures to promote 
the effectiveness of 
subregional, regional and 
global conservation and 
management measures. 
However, the Commission 
has yet to adopt any 
CMM establishing a 
comprehensive system 
of port State controls 
to prevent, deter and 
eliminate IUU fishing.
Structure and scope 
According to art. 27 of the WCPFC Convention2:’a 
port State has the right and the duty to take measures 
to promote the effectiveness of subregional, regional 
and global conservation and management measures’. 
However, there is not one single CMM that provides 
coverage of all port State controls. Thus far, the 
Commission has adopted a number of CMMs containing 
some PSMs that regulate specific situations3, but a 
comprehensive and systematic approach to PSMs  
is lacking. 
With one exception, WCPFC does not exclude domestic 
vessels from the application of PSMs, although the PSMA 
does4. Although WCPFC’s PSMs apply to carrier and 
support vessels, its definition of ‘fishing’ does not include 
some of the fishing-related activities mentioned by the 
PSMA, thus setting a more limited standard than the 
Agreement5. The PSMA incorporates the definition of 
IUU fishing provided by paragraph 3 of the International 
Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, 
Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU). WCPFC 
expressly refers to this definition of IUU fishing in the 
context of its CMM for IUU-listed vessels. However, the 
Convention’s more general provision to deny landing 
and transshipment in port only refers to situations of non-
compliance with CMMs and not to IUU fishing broadly6. 
As a result of all this, WCPFC’s PSMs have a narrower 
scope than those contained in the PSMA.
Information exchange/information systems  
and cooperation
WCPFC has developed several provisions on the need to 
cooperate with the FAO, other RFMOs and, in particular, 
IATTC, including cooperation on monitoring, control and 
surveillance measures7. There is also a partial recognition 
of IUU vessel lists adopted by other RFMOs, since vessels 
listed by any RFMO will be removed from the WCPFC 
register of authorised carrier vessels8.

Information pertinent to WCPFC’s lists of authorised 
vessels is to be transmitted electronically. These lists 
and WCPFC’s IUU vessel lists are available online at 
WCPFC’s website9. These obligations are consistent 
with the PSMA provisions that require port States to 
establish communication mechanisms that allow for direct 
electronic exchange of information (mainly art. 16 and 
Annex D). 
However, WCPFC does not establish obligations to notify 
relevant parties of actions taken at port, such as denial 
of port use, or the results of port inspection10. These 
obligations are essential for the effectiveness of PSMs and 
have been developed in detail by the PSMA. 
Designation and capacity of ports
Under WCPFC rules, a Member ‘may’ notify the Executive 
Director of its designated ports for transshipments. The 
Executive Director will periodically circulate the list of 
designated ports to all Members11. However, there are no 
provisions requiring Members to use designated ports 
for transshipments. Furthermore, there is no regulation of 
designation of ports for uses other than transshipment, 
or to ensure that ports of WCPFC Members have the 
required capacity to conduct inspections.
Prior-to-entry information 
According to the PSMA, port States shall require vessels to 
provide a minimum set of information (described in Annex 
A) prior to entry, with sufficient time to allow for port State 
authorities to examine the information. WCPFC does not 
have any requirements to provide information prior to 
entry.
Denial of entry except for inspection and 
effective action
One of the central obligations of the PSMA is the denial of 
entry into port to IUU fishing and support vessels, except 
for the purposes of inspecting and taking other actions 
against these vessels; these actions need to be as effective 
as denial of entry in deterring IUU fishing. WCPFC CMMs 
do not require Members to deny entry to IUU fishing 
vessels. However, in the case of IUU-listed vessels, CMMs 
require Members to inspect all such vessels and to not 
authorise them to land, transship, refuel or re-supply. Since 
WCPFC does not require Members to take other actions 
against these vessels, and does not prohibit other port 
services such as repairing and drydocking, this provision 
sets a slightly lower standard than the PSMA’s in relation 
to IUU-listed vessels. In addition, this provision does not 
apply any port restrictions to other, non-listed, IUU vessels, 
contrary to what is required by the Agreement12. 
Port use
The PSMA requires port States to deny use of ports, 
including access to port services of any kind, to vessels 
engaged in IUU fishing. Under WCFPC measures, 
Members shall not allow IUU-listed vessels to land,

WCPFC should urgently develop standards for 
conducting inspections and require port States to inspect 
vessels even if they are not IUU-listed; require vessels to 
provide information prior to entry into ports; and mandate 
States to notify relevant parties of all actions taken at port.

transship, refuel or re-supply, but there is no reference to 
denying other port services included in the PSMA13.
In addition to its measures against IUU-listed vessels, 
WCPFC prohibits landings and transshipments from 
vessels not included on the WCPFC’s lists of authorised 
vessels14, and from vessels that do not have the required 
license from a coastal State15. There are also species-
specific prohibitions of landings and transshipments16.
Inspections
Under WCPFC rules, Members are only required to 
inspect IUU-listed vessels, thus covering a very limited 
category of vessels when compared with the PSMA. In 
addition, WCPFC has not developed rules about how 
inspections should be conducted. Although Annex III 
of the Convention gives some guidance on conducting 
transshipment inspections, including transshipment in 
port17 , WCPFC has not yet developed any measure 
requiring Members to inspect vessels transshipping in 
port. Finally, WCPFC has not developed any guidelines on 
the training of port inspectors, as required by the PSMA 
(art. 17 and Annex E).
Flag States
Art. 20 of the PSMA includes a set of flag State obligations 
13  Arts. 9.6 and 11.1 of the PSMA also prohibit packaging, processing, 
maintenance and drydocking to these vessels. 
14  WCPFC has a Record of Fishing Vessels, and an Interim Register of Non-
Member Carrier and Bunker Vessels, authorised to fish and operate in the 
Convention Area beyond national jurisdictions. CMM 2009-01.

designed to facilitate the implementation of PSMs. The 
Agreement also requires flag States to take action against 
a vessel when an inspection report indicates that the vessel 
was involved in IUU fishing. The WCPFC Convention 
includes provisions requiring flag States to fully investigate 
any alleged violation by fishing vessels flying its flag, upon 
reception of relevant information, and to take action 
against such vessels18. Although these obligations are 
rather prescriptive, they do not make any reference to port 
inspections. Since there is no obligation under WCPFC 
to transmit port inspection reports to the flag State, these 
flag State obligations are not likely to be realised under 
WCPFC rules in the same way as is required by the PSMA. 
Ten steps to WCPFC compliance with the PSMA
• Give effect to the WCPFC Convention’s recognition that 
port States have the right and the duty to take measures 
to promote the effectiveness of subregional, regional 
and global conservation and management measures. 
• Adopt a systematic and comprehensive scheme of PSMs 
that are applicable at least to the same categories of 
vessels that are subject to the PSMA. 
• Incorporate IPOA-IUU’s definition of IUU fishing for all 
PSMs. Incorporate the PSMA’s definition of fishing and 
fishing-related activities. 
• Adopt measures requiring Members to notify relevant 
parties and international organisations about all the 
different port State actions taken, as required by the 
PSMA. 
• Adopt a measure requiring Members to designate and 
publicise ports to which vessels may request entry, and 
to ensure that these ports have the capacity to conduct 
inspections.
• In accordance with art. 8 and Annex A of the PSMA, 
adopt a measure requiring that all vessels provide 
advance information before calling into a port, 
regardless of their purpose for calling into port.
• Establish a measure to allow denial of entry into port 
to any vessels for which there is sufficient proof of IUU 
fishing or fishing-related activities, as stipulated in art. 9 
of the PSMA. Clearly establish that such vessels should 
only be allowed port entry for the purposes of inspection 
and effective action. 
• Establish a measure requiring that where a port State 
has reasonable grounds to believe that a vessel has 
been engaged in IUU fishing, it shall deny any kind of 
port use, including port services, to that vessel. 
• Develop a comprehensive and effective system of port 
inspections. Such a system should include: a minimum 
number of vessels that should be inspected annually 
at ports; priorities for inspections; minimum standards 
for inspection procedures and inspection reports; 
guidelines on the training of inspectors.
• Establish clear obligations for flag States to cooperate in 
the implementation of port State controls and act upon 
cases of IUU fishing identified at port inspections, as 
required by art. 20 of the PSMA.

the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) was 
established by the Convention for the Conservation and Management of 
Highly Migratory Fish stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, 
which entered into force on 19 June 2004. the WCPFC aims to ensure the 
long-term conservation and sustainable use of highly migratory fish stocks in 
the western and central Pacific Ocean.
IUU LIsTINgs
as a result of implementing the IUU vessel listing procedure in February 
2007, WCPFC listed three IUU vessels during the research period.
PorT sTATe MeAsUres 
the landing and transshipment of fish products and the provision of 
port services to IUU-listed vessels were not allowed after February 2007 
(Resolution 06/09). 
resULTs of The reseArCh 
Of the three vessels on WCPFC’s IUU vessel list, two were listed with an 
IMO number and one was not. the low number of listed vessels does not 
allow any conclusions to be drawn about the visibility of WCPFC IUU-listed 
vessels. the two WCPFC IUU-listed vessels with IMO numbers accounted 
for 16 port visits to four nCPs of WCPFC. Four of these visits were made in 
aruba, an overseas territory of the netherlands. However, aruba is not a part 
of the European Union and therefore is not a territory of a CP of WCPFC. all 
recorded port visits were therefore to states (or territories) not obliged to 
implement WCPFC’s CMMs.

•� The�WCPFC�does�not�require�its�CPs�to�deny�IUU-listed�
vessels entry to ports, which makes port state measures 
less�effective.�The�measure�in�place�requires�that�CPs�
observe IUU-listed vessels closely while in their ports, so 
that landing of product, transshipment and port services

and mutually accepted list.
•� Generally�there�is�a�lack�of�accountability�regarding�the�
implementation of port state measures because there are 
no performance reviews or evaulations of these measures. 
WCPFC should set up transparent annual review processes 
to assess its CPs’ compliance with port state measures, 
increasing the accountability of CPs towards their port 
state obligations.

to conform to the Port state Measures agreement (PsMa). 
at its next meeting in December 2010, the WCPFC shall 
reconsider a proposal for port state measures based on
