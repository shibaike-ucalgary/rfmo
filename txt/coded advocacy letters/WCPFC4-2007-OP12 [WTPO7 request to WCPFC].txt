WTPO Members fishing in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean request to 
WCPFC  
  
 
 
 
In light of the recommendations of the Scientific Committee to reduce the 
fishing mortality of bigeye tuna by 25% and of yellowfin tuna by 10%; in order to 
achieve the proportional fishing mortality reduction for the purse seine fishery, WTPO 
propose that WCPFC could establish a time and area closure on FADs fishing by all 
purse seine vessels, in areas, and during the time where more juvenile bigeye and 
yellowfin concentrate as best way of reducing juvenile tuna mortality; 
 
Having in mind the application of Conservation and Management Measure 
2006-06 on VMS, control of this time-area closure on FAD fishing will be carried out 
through VMS control for all the vessels to avoid entering the identified areas. Any 
vessel that wants to get inside the closed area shall be regulated through an observer 
scheme to insure that fishing other than FADs fishing is conducted in the closed area; 
 
 That necessary measure is undertaken so that the affected coastal country or 
countries will not be disproportionately burdened by such time and area closure.
