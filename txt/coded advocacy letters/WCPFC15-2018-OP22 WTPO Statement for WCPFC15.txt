WTPO Statement WCPFC 15 
 
 
The World Tuna Purse seine Organization (WTPO) extends its sincere appreciation to the 
Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) for the opportunity given to 
attend the 15th Regular Session as an observer representing the purse seine vessel owner 
members and cooperating non-members, including vessel owners which are SIDS flagged 
and SIDS based vessels. We are bound to cooperate and support the management 
measures in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) fisheries management 
authority. 
 
WTPO reinforces its position statements made in the WCPFC13 in Fiji and WCPFC14 in 
Manila for the commission to consider and adopt a more specific, comprehensive and 
enforceable FAD definition.   
 
WTPO believes that it is time to consider the adoption of a new FAD definition based on 
measures such as buoys with active electronic instrument for tracking, the non-entangling 
and less entangling types of FADs, the continuing learning of observer on board and vessel 
operator in resolving arguments and misunderstanding and recent scientific research and 
recommended use of biodegradable and environment friendly FADs.  
 
The recommended definition as follows: 
 
“Fish-Aggregating Device” (FAD) means anchored, drifting, floating or submerged objects 
deployed and/or tracked by vessels, including through the use of radio and/or satellite 
buoys, for the purpose of aggregating target tuna species for purse-seine fishing 
operations. 
 
This will result in improved management and understanding with other RFMOs in all 
oceans of the world. 
 
While we understand the scientific basis to classify a FAD or non-FAD set, the current 
arrangement has caused uncertainties in pre-determining a set which can lead to a legal 
issue and penalty. The proposed definition should clearly indicate the intent preceding the 
set.
