Dear Sir or Madam,  
 
I am writing on behalf of the Pew Environment Group, in regards to the discussions that will take place 
at the upcoming 8th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Commission (WCPFC) in Guam.  
As you know, the WCPFC Convention Area covers nearly 20% of our planet and is home to the world’s 
largest tuna fishery.  WCPFC’s actions this year can ensure that these critically important fisheries are 
managed responsibly into the future. 
 
WCPFC 8 offers an opportunity for WCPFC members to adopt effective conservation and management 
measures that end and prevent overfishing for tunas, protect vulnerable shark species, and strengthen 
controls against IUU fishing.  Our attached policy statement contains the details of what we believe 
WCPFC delegates should aim to accomplish at this meeting. 
 
This year we also made a short video featuring Pew’s policy experts and footage from the region.  Click 
on the image below to watch Pew’s WCPFC 8 video. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In particular, the Pew Environment Group calls on members of WCPFC to take the following actions at 
the 8th Regular Session of the Commission: 
 
 
End Overfishing and Implement the Precautionary Principle With New Conservation Measures 
for Tropical Tunas   
o Adopt a new Conservation and Management Measure (CMM) for tropical tunas that 
effectively ends over fishing of bigeye tuna  
o Adopt a CMM on Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) to manage their use and provide 
scientists with data.  
o Establish target and limit reference points for tropical tunas. 
o Strengthen the WCPFC compliance regime for CMMs. 
 
 
Adopt Conservation Measures to Protect Sharks  
o Prohibit the retention of oceanic whitetip sharks and establish concrete, precautionary 
catch limits for North Pacific blue sharks.  
o Mandate gear modifications such as the compulsory use of single monofilament nylon 
traces to protect sharks. 
o Prohibit purse seine vessels from intentionally setting nets around whale sharks. 
o Prohibit the removal of shark fins at sea to improve enforcement of the shark finning 
ban. 
 
Strengthen Controls Against Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing  
o Improve port State measures to deter IUU fishing activities. 
o Require unique vessel identifiers for all vessels operating in the WCPFC area. 
 
We would also like to point your attention to the “Closing the Gap” report, which compares tuna RFMO 
port State measures with those established by the Port State Measures Agreement.  The need for such 
an analysis was highlighted during discussion at the Technical and Compliance Committee 7 meeting last 
year, in order to progress implementation of measures to prevent illegal, unregulated and unreported 
fishing in the WCPFC Convention area.  We hope you find this analysis both informative and useful. 
 
We look forward to working with you and your delegation in Guam to progress sustainable fisheries in 
the Pacific through conservation of shark and tuna populations and progress towards elimination of IUU 
fishing.  
 
Please feel free to contact me at gleape@pewtrusts.org at any time.  
 
Sincerely,

the Pew environment Group calls on Members, Cooperating non-members, and Participating territories 
of the Commission (CCMs, collectively) of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) 
to take the following critical actions at the 8th regular session of the Commission:
 
 1. End overfishing And implement The Precautionary Principle With New conservation

1.1 adopt a new comprehensive and effective Conservation and Management Measure 
   
 
(CMM) for tropical tunas.
   
 
1.1.1 extend the fish aggregating device (FaD) closure to end the overfishing of bigeye tuna 
   
 
 
and put a limit on the number of FaD sets during the non-closure period.
   
 
1.1.2 Maintain the management advice from CMM 2008-01 on longline fisheries and increase 
   
 
 
observer coverage to 100 percent on large-scale freezer longliners and 20 percent on all 
   
 
 
other longline vessels.
   
 
1.1.3 ensure that CCMs that benefit the most from bigeye fishing, lead bigeye conservation 
   
 
 
efforts.

the WCPFC aims to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the fish stocks in 
the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO), an area covering 20 percent of the earth’s surface 
and containing the world’s largest tuna fishery. CCMs have committed to valuing the unique 
social, economic, and geographic characteristics of the region without placing a disproportionate 
conservation burden on developing countries.1 While there are challenges in balancing the 
aspirations of developing coastal states with the historical and current fishing by distant-water 
fishing nations, there are still many opportunities to advance sustainable management. 
Given WCPFC’s more modern and comprehensive mandate, CCMs have the ability to apply 
current “best practices” in fisheries management so that the tunas, sharks, and other species 
under its remit do not follow the same path as those managed by tuna rFMOs in other regions. In 
this regard, the Pew environment Group encourages the WCPFC to adopt an effective CMM for 
tropical tunas that ends overfishing of bigeye and prevents overfishing of yellowfin and skipjack; 
adopt conservation measures to protect sharks; and strengthen controls against Iuu fishing.

WiTh NEW coNSERvATioN MEASuRES foR TRoPicAl TuNAS 
as CMM 2008–01 expires, WCPFC has an opportunity to evolve its primary tuna management 
tool—an evolution with precaution at its core. an example of this is the FaD ban which was based 
on sound scientific advice and implemented in order to reduce juvenile bigeye catch during 
closures by purse seine vessels. according to the secretariat of the Pacific Community (sPC), while 
some components of CMM 2008-01 were successful,2 the overall objectives of the measure were 
not achieved. bigeye tuna is still experiencing overfishing and may already be in an overfished 
state.3 With fishing effort primarily managed via fishing “days,” there are still too many vessels 
fishing too many days.4 
 
Species of concern:
Bigeye: the scientific advice has not changed in several years. Overfishing is occurring, and 
the stock may be in an overfished state.5 the new CMM should comply with both the advice 
from the seventh scientific Committee (sC7) and article 30 of the convention so that overall 
fishing mortality is decreased by 39 percent from 2004 levels, and “a disproportionate 
burden of conservation action is not placed onto developing states Parties, and territories 
and possessions.”6 
Yellowfin: Yellowfin should not experience increases in fishing effort, especially in the 
western equatorial region, where the spawning biomass is estimated to have declined to 
about 31 percent of the unexploited level.7 
Skipjack: sC7 noted that future catch rates are likely to decline and catches will decrease 
as stocks are fished down to MsY levels.8 It recommended that the Commission consider 
developing limits on skipjack fishing to slow declines in catch rates associated with 
diminishing biomass.9
The primary shortfalls of CMM 2008–01 were the numerous exemptions, the limited area 
of application, and the failure to limit the overall effort on FADs when the ban was not 
in force. The next generation CMM must address these shortfalls, implement target and 
limit reference points, and provide an enforceable framework for skipjack, yellowfin, and 
bigeye tuna conservation into the future.

POLICY

based on the scientific advice and the requirements spelled out in the convention, the Pew 
environment Group encourages WCPFC CCMs to address the following topics in the next 
generation CMM for tropical tunas:
1.1 AdoPT A NEW, coMPREhENSivE, ANd EffEcTivE coNSERvATioN ANd 
MANAgEMENT MEASuRE (cMM) foR TRoPicAl TuNAS.
1.1.1 Extend the FAD closure to end the overfishing of bigeye and put a limit on the 
number of FAD sets during the non-closure period.
Previously, the primary mechanism to reduce bigeye mortality in the purse seine fishery had been 
the FaD closure. However, increased FaD fishing in the non-closure period offset the projected 
conservation gains of the closure.10 WCPFC should extend the closure and limit the number of FaD 
sets in the non-closure period to 2010 levels.
1.1.2 Maintain the management advice from CMM 2008-01 on longline fisheries and 
increase observer coverage to 100 percent on large-scale freezer longline vessels and 20 
percent on all other longline vessels.
a recent analysis of monitoring, control and surveillance risks in the western and central Pacific notes: 
“unlike other parts of the world, there is a strong case to be made that the majority of Iuu activity 
in the FFa region [Pacific Islands’ Forum Fisheries agency] is associated with licensed vessels.”11 
Misreporting of target catch and bycatch is one of the most widespread compliance issues in the 
region and continues to undermine CMMs and the integrity of data provided to scientists. 
to fully address these problems, 100 percent of the longline fishing activity should be observed. 
Pew recognizes that 100 percent observer coverage would be impossible to implement across the 
entire fleet in the near term. However, given the high impact that large-scale freezer longliners 
have on target and associated and dependent species, WCPFC should mandate 100 percent 
observer coverage on these vessels. Pew also recommends that WCPFC increase coverage levels 
on all other longliners to at least 20 percent, in accordance with the best available scientific 
advice.12 WCPFC should also investigate the potential for the use of electronic monitoring 
(i.e., require cameras and daily catch reporting through a vessel monitoring system, or VMs). 
until misreporting in the longline fishery is addressed, CMMs will continue to fall short of their 
objectives, scientists will have incomplete and inaccurate data for stock assessments, and future 
potential benefits from maintaining sustainable stocks in the region will be undermined. 
1.1.3 Ensure that CCMs that benefit the most from bigeye fishing, lead bigeye conservation 
efforts. 
according to article 30 of the convention, WCPFC must implement measures to ensure that a 
disproportionate burden of conservation action is not placed on developing states Parties, and 
territories and possessions. In short, the WCPFC CCMs that benefit the most from bigeye fishing 
should lead conservation efforts. (see tables 1 and 2).

at the 7th technical and Compliance Committee (tCC7) meeting in november 2011, it was 
informally proposed that a $250 charge per tonne of bigeye tuna caught by CCM longline fleets be 
charged as a conservation levy. this is one possible solution, as is the possibility of “pricing” vessel 
days at a higher rate when fishing on FaDs, in recognition of the impact of that effort on juveniles 
(i.e., one FaD fishing day may be charged as two fishing days). regardless of the mechanism 
used, the aim must be to minimize juvenile bigeye catch, and not to under-manage the bigeye 
population or treat it as a secondary consideration, both of which run counter to implementation of 
an ecosystem-based approach.
1.1.4 Maintain and expand high seas pocket closures.
High seas pocket closures should be maintained at least until measures demonstrated to prevent 
and deter Iuu activity in those areas are in place and effectively implemented. For these closures to 
be effective in reducing the catch of bigeye tuna, overall fishing effort must be reduced instead of 
displaced, and the closures should also apply to longline fisheries as they routinely transship at sea.

1.1.5 Take measures to conserve tuna across the entire convention area, ensuring 
compatibility between the high seas and EEZs.
the new CMM should cover the entire WCPFC Convention area to avoid the pitfalls of the previous 
measure. Furthermore, measures between eeZs and high seas areas must be consistent to ensure 
that conservation is not undermined throughout the range of the species. the Pacific Island 
states that are Parties to the nauru agreement (Pna) have shown leadership in adopting strong 
precautionary measures that are in force in their eeZs, and the WCPFC should take measures that 
are equally effective in conserving these critical resources across the entire convention area. 
1.2 AdoPT A cMM oN fAdS To MANAgE ThEiR uSE ANd PRovidE SciENTiSTS

In addition to an extended FaD closure, CCMs fishing with FaDs should be required to submit FaD 
management plans and FaD data so the scientific committee has better information on the extent 
of their use, potential ecosystem impacts associated with the uncontrolled proliferation of FaDs, 
and marine debris information. requirements of FaD plans should be clearly stipulated to ensure 
comprehensive management. thus far, CCM compliance with FaD management requirements has 
been extremely poor, as noted in the Pew submission WCPFC-tCC7-2011-Ob-01. the uncontrolled 
proliferation of FaDs must be addressed as a matter of priority.

article six of the WCPFC Convention states: “In applying the precautionary approach, the 
members of the Commission shall: (a) apply the guidelines set out in annex II of the agreement, 
which shall form an integral part of this Convention, and determine, on the basis of the best 
scientific information available, stock-specific reference points and the action to be taken if they 
are exceeded.”15 
as a first step in implementing this critical requirement, the interim target and limit reference 
points suggested in Working Paper WCPFC-tCC7-2011-01, “Discussion of a Possible Way Forward 
in the Development of a CMM for bigeye, Yellowfin and skipjcak tuna in the WCPFC Convention 
area”, should be adopted at WCPFC 8 for tropical tunas. Further discussion on target reference 
points should be undertaken in 2012, and adopted at WCPFC 9 for all species managed by WCPFC.

noncompliance with CMMs threatens fish populations, and associated and dependent species. 
It also undermines the activities of those who play by the rules. to ensure that CCMs are fully 
accountable for their fishing activities, WCPFC should agree to implement a comprehensive and 
transparent compliance regime that systematically reviews fishing activities and automatically 
imposes appropriate penalties on CCMs that violate conservation measures. this process should 
allow for the consideration of all relevant data, including information from observer organizations.

sharks caught in high seas fisheries are among the ocean’s most vulnerable animals. More than 
one-half of the shark species taken in high seas fisheries are classified as endangered, Vulnerable, 
or near threatened on the International union for the Conservation of nature (IuCn) red List.16 
until robust stock assessments are available, CMMs should be developed to protect sharks as a 
precautionary measure. even though the WCPFC is the most modern of the tuna rFMOs and has 
the clearest mandate to protect species within its jurisdiction, it is the only tuna rFMO that has 
not taken meaningful action on sharks. the WCPFC must act to ensure that targeted fishing and 
bycatch do not deplete shark species and drive them to extinction.

sC7 recommend specifically mitigation measures for oceanic whitetip sharks and north Pacific 
blue sharks. Information presented to the sC7 suggests the need for immediate action: “Although 
there has been no stock assessment conducted for this species to date, there is consensus that the 
oceanic whitetip population in the Atlantic is depleted. Recent analysis . . . show[s] clear, steep and 
declining trends in abundance indices for this species. Analysis . . . confirmed that oceanic whitetip 
sizes decreased significantly until samples became too scarce for analysis. Given the strong existing 
evidence for the depleted state of the oceanic whitetip population in the WCPO, stock assessment 
studies may clarify but will not alter the case for further conservation and management action.”17
additionally, WCPFC should continue to add to the key shark species list. the remaining shark species 
that are at highest risk from longline and purse seine fishing, such as those identified in the Pacific 
Islands regional Plan of action18 (PI-rPOa)—blacktip, salmon, silvertip, sandbar, and Galapagos sharks, 
as well as pelagic stingrays—should be included. Without catch data for these species, it is difficult to 
assess whether they are being negatively affected by the longline and purse seine fleets.

sharks are targeted or caught as bycatch in fisheries around the world. their life history 
characteristics make them extremely susceptible to fishing pressure, and the recovery 
potential for depleted shark species is significantly less than that of other fish species. Many 
longline vessels use a wire leader (also known as a steel trace) to secure their catch on the line. 
Whether unintended, unwanted, or highly sought after, shark bycatch from wire leaders and 
the impact of shark removals on wider ecosystem stability need urgent attention. 
Prohibition of wire leaders would also facilitate compliance with WCPFC’s existing CMM 2010–07 
paragraph 10. Gear modifications, such as the use of single monofilament nylon leaders, should be 
mandated so that fewer sharks are caught as bycatch in WCPFC tuna fisheries. additionally, vessels 
fishing in the WCPFC area should be required to immediately release all live sharks.

to protect these slow-moving sharks, WCPFC should prohibit purse seine vessels from intentionally 
setting nets around whale sharks in the convention area and in their eeZs, because mortality 
occurs in approximately one in every 10 sets involving a whale shark interaction.20 Further, because 
whale sharks rarely escape unassisted before the net is closed, vessel operators must be required 
to safely release entangled whale sharks. 
It is estimated that about 60 whale sharks were killed by fishing nets in 2009 in  
WCPFC fisheries, which is far too many for a species classified by the IUCN as Vulnerable 
to extinction.
Scientific studies have shown a nylon monofilament leader is actually a better gear 
option than a wire leader for reducing bycatch of sharks and increasing the catch of some 
targeted species.19

WCPFC’s existing ban on finning can be strengthened by prohibiting the removal of shark fins at 
sea (requiring that sharks that are caught are landed with their fins naturally attached), which will 
also facilitate collection of species-specific catch data and help to ensure compliance with existing 
WCPFC conservation and management measures for sharks. additionally, vessels should be 
prohibited from dumping shark carcasses after landing.

Iuu fishing is a serious concern in the WCPFC convention area, where it undermines conservation 
and management measures, inhibits stock rebuilding efforts, increases overfishing, and threatens 
food security and livelihoods for poor coastal communities. the WCPFC should use all available 
tools to combat Iuu fishing in the convention area. 
3.1 iMPRovE PoRT STATE MEASuRES To dETER iuu fiShiNg AcTiviTiES.
Port state Measures (PsMs)22 are some of the most cost-effective tools to combat Iuu fishing. the 
negotiation and subsequent adoption of the Port state Measures agreement (PsMa)23 in 2009 
show international recognition of the critical role that port states can play in stopping Iuu fishing. 
the u.n. General assembly has urged states to cooperate regionally through rFMOs to adopt all 
necessary port measures consistent with International law.24
the Pew environment Group has conducted a gap analysis comparing the PsMs in WCPFC and 
the other tuna rFMOs with those established by the PsMa. the research assessed the extent to 
which measures adopted by these rFMOs meet the new international minimum standard set by 
the PsMa. this work revealed a number of gaps in the WCPFC’s PsMs.25 In particular, WCPFC lacks 
a comprehensive inspection scheme; it does not have rules in place requiring vessels to provide 
information prior to entering ports; and it does not require port states to designate ports of entry 
for foreign vessels.  
the Pew environment Group is aware that a number of WCPFC CCMs cannot fully implement 
the provisions of the PsMa immediately. this should not, however, be an impediment to WCPFC 
taking the initiative to strengthen its PsMs. WCPFC can initiate constructive action towards the 
development of stronger measures by gradually adopting enhanced PsMs in line with the PsMa. 
In doing so, WCPFC CCMs should analyze their needs and identify the steps they should be 
taking to implement PsMs effectively.26 Developed state members should identify options for 
assisting developing states to effectively implement PsMs. this should include, but not be limited 
to, participation in the process initiated by the u.n. Food and agriculture Organization (FaO) to 
implement article 21 of the PsMa on the special needs and requirements of developing states.27 
WCPFC CCMs should take steps at the March 2012 meeting to begin strengthening PsMs, with the 
aim of meeting the standards of the PsMa by 2014. this should include providing the necessary 
support to developing states to effectively implement PsMs.

A study has estimated the loss from IUU fishing in the western and central Pacific Ocean  
region to be approximately 21 to 46 percent of reported catch, which is valued at up to 
US$1.5 billion per year.21

In particular, at this year’s meeting, WCPFC CCMs should consider adopting the following reforms28:
1. Develop a comprehensive system of port inspections.
2. establish clear duties to notify relevant states, rFMOs and international organizations about all 
the different port state actions taken.
3. adopt a measure requiring port states to designate and publicize ports of entry. 
4. adopt a measure requiring all vessels to provide advance information, following the standards 
of annex a of the PsMa, before calling into a port.

the implementation of uVIs for tuna vessels will increase transparency in the fisheries sector and 
enhance coordination of action against Iuu fishing operators. research conducted by the Pew 
environment Group confirms the need for uVIs.29 In addition, the Kobe III joint meeting of the 
tuna rFMOs acknowledged that these bodies need to make progress on implementing vessel 
identifiers.30
the only fully developed and currently used uVI is the International Maritime Organization (IMO) 
number, provided through registering with the IHs Fairplay31 ship numbering scheme (IHs-F, 
previously Lloyd’s register). 
In accordance with the recommendations of Kobe III, the WCPFC should require any fishing and 
support vessel larger than 100 gross tonnes (Gt), or longer than 24 meters that are authorized to 
operate in the convention area to register with the IHs Fairplay ship numbering system and obtain 
an IMO number. this number should be on record, used in all relevant communications, and made 
publicly available.32
WcPfc and relevant 2011 uN Sustainable fisheries decisions A/RES/66/68.(Adopted in 
december 2011.)
 
1. Welcoming shark sanctuaries
2. Welcoming the COFI decision to report on challenges in implementation of IPOa-sharks 
3. expressing support for work at the WtO to prohibit subsidies which contribute to 
overcapacity and overfishing 
4. Calling upon states to study, develop and adopt effective management measures to 
minimize by-catch, including specifically the issue of FaDs 
5. recognizing the importance of regulating transshipment as a tool in combating Iuu.

IHs Fairplay (IHsF) is the originating source for the IMO ship number and is the sole authority with responsibility for assigning and 
validating these numbers. the numbers are issued from the global maritime databases maintained by IHsF and consist of a unique 
seven digit number. IHsF manages this scheme on behalf of the IMO. see: http://www.ihsfairplay.com/about/imo_standards/imo_
standards.html
