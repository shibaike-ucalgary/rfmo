WWF POSITION
9th Regular Session of the
Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC)
Manila, Philippines – 2-6 December 2012
Introduction and Summary
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) would like to thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission
(WCPFC) 1 for the opportunity to address the 9th Regular Session of the WCPFC on its critically important role in the
adequate management of the Western Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) fisheries.  Conservation of these ecologically
and  economically  important  fishery  resources  depends  heavily  on  the  ability  of  the  members  of  the  WCPFC  to
collaboratively work together to develop and implement successful conservation and management measures.  The
regulatory measures proposed and implemented by the WCPFC represent one of the legs of the three-legged stool of
successful sustainable and responsible fisheries management, the other legs consisting of the science provided by the
Scientific Committee (SC) and the compliance measures provided by the Technical and Compliance Committee
(TCC).  Without firm support on each one of those three components, the stool falls over and fisheries management
fails.
WWF once again calls on members of the WCPFC to address the issues and recommendations raised at SC8, TCC8,
and WCPFC8 as well as observe the experience of other RFMOs in their own efforts to achieve and maintain
improved measures for monitoring and surveillance.  WWF wishes to reiterate its position offered in Guam in March
2012 (WCPFC8) and, taking into account the WCPFC-related meetings held since, the recommendations listed in
bullets below.  For more detail and background on each position, please reference the associated Appendix for this
document.
Conservation and Management Measures
Reference Points
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Adopt precautionary B-based Limit Reference Points (preferably based on Spawning Biomass) for all
WCPO fishery stocks under its authority;
�
Adopt  precautionary  F-based  Limit  Reference  Points  as  an interim measure to attempt to control the
exploitation rate;
�
Direct the SC to develop a range of alternatives for precautionary Target Reference Points for
consideration in 2014; and
�
Consider risk probability levels of breaching the Limit Reference Points of 10% or less as a precautionary
measure.

WWF POSITION
Harvest Control Rules
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Thoroughly review the SC8 recommendations for HCRs and the outcomes of the Management Objectives
Workshop; and
�
Urgently pursue development and implementation of Harvest Control Rules for all stocks under its
authority to be achieved by 2015.
Harvest Strategies
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Develop strong, science-based Harvest Strategies to be implemented simultaneously with the
development of precautionary Reference Points and Harvest Control Rules.
High Seas Closures
WWF recommends that the WCPFC should:
�
Develop a program to treat the HSPs as “Special Management Zones” (SMZ) subject to mutually agreed
rules and measures contingent upon strict reporting and observation requirements by the WCPFC;
�
Consider a Vessel Days at Sea (VDS)-type scheme specific to HSPs which would count against the overall
effort of the CCM;
�
Rescind the waiver of the FAD closure on the domestic purse seine fisheries offered to CCMs displaced
from the HSP closure areas upon transition of those areas to SMZs; and
�
Require all CCMs allowed to re-enter the HSPs to implement complementary measures to the revised
CMM  2008-01  (enacted  at  WCPFC9)  in  addition  to  an  equivalent  compliance  and  monitoring  scheme
applicable to the domestic purse seine fisheries.
Tuna Species
Bigeye Tuna
WWF supports the SC8 recommendation for development of a revised CMM for BET, YFT and SKJ tuna stocks.
Consistent with this recommendation, the WCPFC must:
�
Adapt and adopt management measures that apply to all sectors of the fishery;
�
Further strengthen the control of FAD activities;
�
Build on the apparent success of some fleets in reducing their dependence on FADs to achieve greater
control of FAD activity outside the closures, including control of the number of FADs set throughout a
year instead of FAD time closures;
�
Implement an absolute reduction of the total number of FAD sets to the levels no greater than those in
the fishery in 2010;
�
Clearly define limits on purse seine effort that are applicable in different areas;
�
Implement measures which reduce fishing mortality on BET from the longline fishery; and
�
Consider a complete closure of the purse seine fishery for a defined period of time during the highest
catch or catch rates of juvenile BET, including any mitigation measures necessary to address adverse
socioeconomic impacts.
Yellowfin Tuna
WWF recommends that the WCPFC take proactive and precautionary measures to prevent any further decline of
the YFT stock and that WCPFC must:
�
Implement the SC7 recommendation to the WCPFC to limit YFT fishing mortality to its 2001-2004 level
in the western equatorial region.
Pacific Bluefin Tuna
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Revise CMM-2010-04 and remove all current exemptions from CMM-2010-04; and
�
Encourage all member states to implement the substantial management measures for juvenile (age 0-3)
PBT to keep fishing mortality less than its 2002-2004 level.

WWF POSITION
South Pacific Albacore Tuna
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Introduce effective capacity and effort controls for management of the South Pacific ALB stock; and
�
Encourage domestic fisheries managers to implement Tuna Management Plans that freeze licenses for
ALB at current levels and seek to reduce that number to a level that achieves Maximum Economic Yield.
Bycatch
Whale Sharks
WWF recommends that the WCPFC should:
�
Acknowledge  the  SC8  conclusion  that  whale  sharks  meet  the  criteria  for  consideration  as  a  key  shark
species and define whale sharks as a key shark species.
�
Adopt Australia’s Proposal to Address the Impact of Purse Seine Fishing Activity on Whale Sharks, which
includes a specific prohibition for setting purse seines on whale sharks.
�
Support procedures for the careful and safe release of whale sharks inadvertently captured in purse
seines.
�
Recommend requirements for logbook and observer reporting of all interactions with whale sharks for
submission to the flag State and to the WCPFC.
�
Encourage the development of reference points for non-target species, including whale sharks, as
envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention.
Oceanic Whitetip and Silky Sharks
Based on the recommendations of the SC8 regarding oceanic whitetip and silky sharks, the WCPFC must:
�
Endorse  additional  mitigation  measures  and  maintain  existing  measures  in  an  effort  to  improve  the
status of the WCPO oceanic whitetip and silky shark stocks including:
o
prohibit the retention, transhipment, storage, on-board sale, and landing of oceanic whitetip and
silky sharks in all fisheries managed by the WCPFC;
o
mandate the prompt and careful release of any captured oceanic whitetip and silky sharks; and
o
ensure that all interactions with oceanic whitetip and silky sharks are reported in terms of number
and status of animals through logbooks and observer records.
�
Develop and implement reference points for non-target species, including oceanic whitetip sharks and
silky sharks, as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPFC Convention.¶
Shark Finning
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Focus  more  discretely  on  the  overall  management  of  shark  harvests  including  the  development  and
implementation of reference points for non-target species as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the
WCPFC Convention;
�
Support and promote the collection of species-specific shark catch data in the WCPO through observer
records and logbooks;
�
Implement a requirement for all sharks be landed whole with their fins naturally attached, allowing for a
“partial cut method” to facilitate safety and storage; and
�
Until  such  time  a  “fins  attached”  policy  is  enacted,  implement  a  prohibition  on  the  transfer  of  any
unattached shark fins at sea.
Turtles
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Formally acknowledge the deficiencies of CMM 2008-03;
�
Adopt the sea turtle conservation and management measures proposed by WWF in the Compendium of
Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures (CMMs);
�
Develop and implement CMM revisions aimed at:
o
Strengthening key language and reducing the ambiguity in desired outcomes of the CMM,
thereby enabling not only stronger conservation measures but also better monitoring of CMM
effectiveness;

WWF POSITION
o
Committing explicitly to a goal of zero mortality of sea turtles and catch rates as close to zero as
possible;
o
Introducing new interim binding measures including mandatory adoption of bycatch reduction
gear  (e.g.  circle  hooks)  and  other  mitigation  techniques,  conducting  research  on  mitigation
techniques,  and  reporting  on  sea  turtle  impacts,  with  a  goal  of  later  implementing  a
consolidated optimal bycatch mitigation package;
o
Setting an appropriate interim catch rate that would trigger move-on provisions; and
o
Taking appropriate actions to ensure observer coverage in the longline fleet reaches
recommended minimum levels with a view to progressively phase in 100% observer coverage.
�
Revive efforts to ensure the appropriate monitoring and documentation of compliance with CMM 2008-
03  9and  any  revisions  to  the  CMM)  ensuring  that  member  countries  are  meeting  minimum  data
collection and surveillance requirements; and
�
Reconstitute efforts to clearly communicate the ecological and economic benefits of circle hook adoption
and sea turtle mitigation techniques to CCMs and their fleets.
Seabirds
WWF recommends that the WCPFC should:
�
Adopt the seabird conservation measures recommended by ACAP as the best practice for longline
operations, including the use of weighted branch lines, night setting, and bird scaring (tori) lines;
�
Endorse the use of 2 out of 3 of the seabird bycatch best practices on all longline vessels fishing south of
25°S; and
�
Consider implementation of the seabird bycatch best practices throughout the WCPFC CA where
incidence of seabird interaction warrants mitigation measures.
Monitoring and Compliance
Catch Documentation System
As  part  of  the  CDS  development,  WWF  requests  that  the  WCPFC  consider  certain  key  features  of  a  good  CDS
system, including:
�
A requirement for electronic documentation to accompany all catch harvested, landed, transhipped,
traded domestically, exported, processed, imported and re-exported;
�
Complementary measures to maximize the effectiveness of the CDS through:
o
ensuring that transhipment at sea does not compromise the effectiveness of the CDS;
o
adopting Port State Measures implemented simultaneously with the CDS; and
o
adopting trade restriction measures against flag States with vessels on the IUU list.
�
Parameters that include all species of tunas, billfish, and sharks managed by the WCPFC;
�
A  commitment  to  continuous  improvement  of  the  CDS  by  investigating  the  benefits  and  feasibility  of
verification systems such as electronic tagging and the use of biotechnology;
�
Establishment of a capacity development fund to provide a cost-sharing mechanism that enables
progressive cost sharing among member states; and
�
Maximizing retailer and public access to data through modern electronic tools.
Regional Observer Programme
With respect to the continued implementation and operation of the ROP, the WCPFC must:
�
Implement a binding, consistent, and consolidated set of standards for the ROP;
�
Conduct a phased implementation of 100% observer coverage on all fishing and support vessels;
�
Revise the Observer Provider Code of Conduct to create more substantive requirements on Observer
Providers  and  recipients,  including  the  implementation  of  a  schedule  of  fines  and  sanctions  for  non-
compliance to be applicable to throughout the WCPFC CA;
�
Develop and implement strong set of Minimum Observer Health, Safety, and Welfare Standards to be
applicable to all vessels operating throughout the WCPFC CA;
�
Develop and implement a standardized administrative review system to address observer grievances that
is empowered to impose sanctions and/or penalties on offending vessel owners, captains, masters,
and/or  crew,  who  engage  in  bribery,  threats,  intimidation,  or  harassment  of  any  kind  against  an
observer which would otherwise impede them from conducting their official duties; and

WWF POSITION
�
Implement a Conservation and Management Measure stating that any finding from an administrative
review  that  confirms  an  instance  of  bribery,  threats,  intimidation,  or  harassment  of  an  observer
constitutes an IUU violation resulting in the vessel on which the offense occurred being placed on the
IUU list.;
�
Consider EM in situations deemed appropriate for enforcement and monitoring goals specific to those
vessels;
�
Reconstitute  the  Data  Consultative  Committee  (DCC)  to  address  current  data  issues  in  the  ROP,
including consideration of:
o
Revisions of data fields for non-target species to include detailed entries for seabirds, turtles, and
sharks, broken out by species, in all observer reporting submissions; and
o
Removal of redundant, duplicative, or otherwise obsolete data fields; and
�
Develop a more comprehensive analysis and design plan for spatially and temporally representative
observer coverage of each fishery operating in the WCPFC CA.
IUU Measures
The WCPFC must maintain strong procedures for identifying, listing, and retaining IUU vessels on IUU Lists to
ensure that the integrity of the WCPO fisheries including:
�
Ensuring  the  burden  of  proof  must  always  remain  with  the  IUU  offender  to  explicitly  prove  through
appropriate documentation (WCPFC CMM 2010-06 paragraph 25 a-e) that all obligations have been met
before being removed from an IUU list;
�
Maintaining the current definition of IUU fishing for the purpose of the IUU list; and
�
Ensuring  that  “sanctions  of  adequate  severity”  are  always  onerous  enough  to  prevent,  deter,  and
eliminate any future IUU conduct and not just a “cost of doing business.”
Data and Statistics
WWF recommends that the WCPFC should:
�
Repeat the request for CCMs who have yet to provide operational level catch and effort data provide Data
Improvement Plans to the WCPFC; and
�
Request that, until operational catch/effort data are provided, non-compliant CCMs must provide annual
catch estimates by gear and species for waters of national jurisdiction and high seas areas separately, as
per the scientific data provision rules of the WCPFC.
Miscellaneous
Cost Recovery and Optimization
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Oppose the implementation of a fee for observers to attend WCPFC meetings.
Conclusion
WWF once again calls on the WCPFC to look carefully look at our collective conduct as nations with a responsibility
for managing fishery resources in the WCPFC CA.  With respect to each of the agenda items addressed at the
WCPFC9 Regular Meeting, the commission delegates must genuinely consider whether previous actions have been
responsible and commendable in achieving the overarching goal of fisheries sustainability in the WCPO.
The WCPFC shares the distinction as the youngest RFMO, but is also regarded as arguably the most effective.
However, we all must constantly guard against the complacency and greed that leads to poor decision-making
resulting in the collapsing fish stocks in other regions.  Unfortunately, with some stocks in the WCPO, such as bigeye
tuna and oceanic whitetip sharks, we are treading dangerously down a path leading to trouble.
The WCPFC possesses the ability and opportunity to chart the course towards sustainable fishery resources,
especially tuna, in the WCPO.  The WCPFC and its subsidiary bodies must continually promote and adopt strong and
effective conservation and management action to maintain and rebuild tuna stocks, implement appropriate
monitoring and enforcement measures, promote a viable tuna industry, and support vibrant coastal communities
throughout the South Pacific.

Appendix: WWF Position Discussion
9th Regular Session of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries
Commission (WCPFC) Manila, Philippines – 2-6 December 2012
Conservation and Management Measures
WWF applauds the recent efforts of managers to seek the development and implementation of effective, science-
based Harvest Strategies, Harvest Control Rules, and Reference Points (HS/HCR/RP).  Stock assessments used to
estimate the amount of fish in a particular stock and the rate of fishing on that stock throughout the region has
continually improved.  WWF encourages the WCPFC to urgently pursue the implementation of these management
measures as a way to reduce the logistical burden on managers while streamlining the management process and, in
turn, ensuring the sustainability of WCPO fisheries.  To assist this effort, WWF has created a simplified explanation
of these basic management measures for distribution at this meeting.
Reference Points
The WCPFC must formally adopt explicit Limit and Target Reference Points (LTRP’s) for all WCPO fishery stocks
under its authority.  Implementation of these formally designated LTRP’s represents an absolute priority for the
sustainable management of the fishery resources in the WCPO.  Existing science supports the implementation of
well-defined and precautionary biologically-based Limit Reference Points and WWF generally supports the
recommendations of the SC.  While Target Reference Points require additional consideration of socio-economic
considerations, current understanding of the biological and socio-economic conditions does not prevent the
implementation of sufficiently precautionary interim Target Reference Points at this time. While LTRPs are needed
in all fisheries, the WCPFC should prioritise the implementation of LTRP’s in at least the four key tuna species,
including skipjack (SKJ), albacore (ALB), bigeye (BET), and yellowfin (YFT), at this time.
Very simply, reference points provide management decision-makers an objective tool to determine whether a fish
stock  size  is  becoming  too  small  or  fishing  pressure  is  becoming  too  great.   WWF  notes  that  the  WCPFC  has
discussed and considered reference points since 2006 and that, while the SC has made several recommendations to
the WCPFC on appropriate reference points, the WCPFC has failed to adopt formal explicit reference points.
Nonetheless, while stock assessments conducted by SPC use BMSY and FMSY as Limit Reference Points and provide
advice to the WCPFC, more explicit reference points are justified based on the available scientific information.
At the recent SC8 meeting in Busan, one CCM expressed a preference for fishing mortality-based (i.e. F-based) Limit
Reference Points, justified by the perception that: (1) fishing mortality is a parameter that the WCPFC controls; (2)
they are more likely to be robust against changes in recruitment; and (3) they require less information about the
biological responses of tunas especially at lower biomass.2  While this may be relevant to tunas in this region which
have not been fished down to very low levels, it fails to recognize inherent vulnerabilities to the application of such a
measure despite perceived above-average resilience and associated %SPR values.  While simply managing to a
default MSY as a natural Limit Reference Point may seem appealing because it results in a perceived optimum level
of depletion, it also results in a potential failure of the management system to respond in a timely and effective way.
An F-based Limit Reference Point is indeed designed to control fishing capacity or, in other words, the rate at which
the harvest influences the stock size.  However, under the existing management regime, managing solely under an F-

WWF POSITION
based model leaves too much room for delay in action and, as a result, fails to respond adequately to changes in stock
size or fishing pressure.  For example, there is typically two years between stock assessments in all WCPO fisheries.
In that two year time period, assume that the fleet capacity, either through size or efficiency, expands substantially.
Due to the timing of the stock assessments and data availability for the meetings, it could be three years or more
before the WCPFC will be capable of addressing the unsustainably increased fishing mortality.  This dynamic can
result in a severe overshoot of mortality resulting in the need for substantial painful retractions of effort and
significant rebuilding measures.
While the uncertainties associated with biomass (B-based) Limit Reference Points make them a less attractive option
to some stakeholders, they constitute a critical tool to ensure that stock sustainability is ensured.  F-based Limit
Reference Points are important and useful, but not as critical as a B-based limit because a B-based limit ensures a
biological floor that the fishery cannot go below.
In March 2012, WCPFC8 endorsed the hierarchical approach to identifying Limit Reference Points and tasked the
Scientific Services Provider with preparing proposed Limit Reference Points for the consideration of SC8.  As stated
in  WWF's  Position  Statement  to  WCPFC-8,  2012,  WWF  strongly  urges  the  WCPFC  to  formally  adopt  Limit  and
Target Reference Points. The adoption of explicitly determined Limit and Target Reference Points for at least the four
key tuna species, namely SKJ, ALB, YFT, and BET, is an absolute priority for the sustainable management of these
resources in the WCPO.
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Adopt precautionary B-based Limit Reference Points3 (preferably based on Spawning
Biomass)4 for all WCPO fishery stocks under its authority;
�
Adopt precautionary F-based Limit Reference Points as an interim measure to attempt to
control the exploitation rate;5
�
Direct the SC to develop a range of alternatives for precautionary Target Reference Points for
consideration in 2014; and
�
Consider risk probability levels of breaching the Limit Reference Points of 10% or less as a
precautionary measure.
Harvest Control Rules
Under the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement Convention, article 5(c), the precautionary approach6 became a basic
element of sustainable fisheries management.  Globally, countries and regional organizations have adopted the
measure as a matter of domestic and international law supporting prudent fisheries management.  The measure was
also  specifically  included  in  the  FAO  Code  of  Conduct  for  Responsible  Fisheries,  serving  as  a  guidepost  for
sustainable fisheries management.  Furthermore, the measure appears prominently in the FAO Guidelines for
ecolabelling, and is a critical element for consideration in ecolabelling certification schemes such as the Marine
Stewardship Council (MSC).
It is possible to make the implementation of a precautionary approach operational through pre-agreed management
actions, or specifically, Harvest Control Rules, that trigger management actions when stock status indicators reach
pre-defined Reference Points.
Currently,  no  explicit  Harvest  Control  Rules  exist  in  the  WCPFC.   The  WCPFC  currently  bases  management  on
implied reference points informed by basic catch and effort data, length-frequency and tagging data.  Limited
management actions include limiting fishing effort through various ad hoc input controls such as the PNA’s Vessel
Day Scheme (VDS), closure of high seas pockets, FAD closures, and implementation of capacity limits (primarily
driven by concerns for BET and YFT).  Therefore, the absence of formally agreed Harvest Control Rules is necessary
for the WCPFC to fully implement management best practices.
At its most basic, a Harvest Control Rule is simply a pre-agreed action, or set of actions, to be taken by a management
body that are designed to achieve a medium or long-term Target Reference Point while avoiding reaching a Limit
Reference Point. Simple Harvest Control Rules can be described as an “if, then” statement.  An example of a very
simple Harvest Control Rule would be “if the fishery stock level falls below the target level, then the level of fishing
must be reduced by 20%.” Managers may also agree in advance what the specific management actions are to reach
that 20% reduction in the level of fishing, such as a regional closure or gear restriction.
Implementing Reference Points as part of Harvest Control Rules puts in place clear decision rules which minimize
excessive debate and allow managers to act quickly and decisively when the fishery reaches a pre-defined threshold
(e.g. Limit or Target Reference Point).  Furthermore, Harvest Control Rules lay the foundation for developing well-
defined fisheries management plans that are grounded in sound science.

WWF POSITION
The WCPFC must develop and implement Harvest Control Rules (HCR’s) consisting of explicit, pre-agreed actions
designed to achieve a medium or long-term Target Reference Point and avoiding reaching a Limit Reference Point
while explicitly defining intended responses to changes in stock status.  Well-defined HCR’s must seek consistency
with the Harvest Strategy and ensure that the exploitation rate is reduced as a Limit Reference Points are approached
while also considering a wide range of uncertainties in their design.
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Thoroughly review the SC8 recommendations for HCRs and the outcomes of the
Management Objectives Workshop; and
�
Urgently pursue development and implementation of Harvest Control Rules for all stocks
under its authority to be achieved by 2015.
Harvest Strategies
A Harvest Strategy represents the basic guidelines that stipulate how managers go about setting general harvest
levels or allowable fishing levels.  The choice of Harvest Strategy affects the yield from the fishery and the risk of
overfishing.  Efforts to define Reference Points and Harvest Control Rules help to clearly inform the Harvest
Strategy.  The current rudimentary Harvest Strategy employed in the WCPFC does not contain any Harvest Control
Rules and, as such, does not reflect best practice.
The WCPFC must develop well-defined Harvest Strategies or Policies based on distinct, pre-agreed Reference Points
and Harvest Control Rules.  The Harvest Strategies should reflect clear guidelines that stipulate how managers set
general harvest levels or allowable fishing levels.  Any Harvest Strategy considered must contain strong,
precautionary directives to ensure that stock size stays above the Limit Reference Point and, ideally, a Target
Reference Point set to achieve Maximum Economic Yield.  A well-developed Harvest Strategy should also consider
details of a rebuilding plan should a stock go below the Limit Reference Point.
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Develop strong, science-based Harvest Strategies to be implemented simultaneously with the
development of precautionary Reference Points and Harvest Control Rules.
High Seas Closures
In general, WWF supports the implementation of conservation and management measures where the science
indicates those measures represent important contributors to tuna conservation and the health of the ecosystem they
depend upon.  However, at this time, there is insufficient scientific evidence to indicate the High Seas Pocket (HSP)
closures in the WCPO have effectively contributed to tuna conservation and management.  Furthermore, contrary
evidence suggests that effort is ultimately displaced from the HSP closure areas where bycatch rates tend to be lower
and into the nearshore EEZ areas where bycatch tends to be higher.  WWF notes the very limited impact of the high
seas closures on the overall management of tunas in the WCPO, as evidenced by the overall failure of CMM 2008-01
despite good adherence to the HSP closure reported by the SC87
WWF agrees with the SC8 recommendation that closing areas/time entirely to purse seine fishing without
consideration of the fate of displaced fishing effort will not be effective for BET conservation and less profitable to
purse seine operations as a whole.8  The High Seas Pockets (HSPs) require a unique approach that is applicable to all
Members, Co-operating Non-Members, and Participating Territories (CCMs).
WWF recommends that the WCPFC should:
�
Develop  a  program  to  treat  the  HSPs  as  “Special  Management  Zones”  (SMZ)  subject  to
mutually agreed rules and measures contingent upon strict reporting and observation
requirements by the WCPFC;
�
Consider a Vessel Days at Sea (VDS)-type scheme specific to HSPs which would count against
the overall effort of the CCM;
�
Rescind the waiver of the FAD closure on the domestic purse seine fisheries offered to CCMs
displaced from the HSP closure areas upon transition of those areas to SMZs; and
�
Require all CCMs allowed to re-enter the HSPs to implement complementary measures to the
revised  CMM  2008-01  (enacted  at  WCPFC9)  in  addition  to  an  equivalent  compliance  and
monitoring scheme applicable to the domestic purse seine fisheries.

Tuna Species
Bigeye Tuna
WCPFC8 previously adopted CMM 2011-01 to ensure that measures remain applicable for 2011 under CMM 2008-01
(with several noted exemptions) until 28 February 2013.9  Assisted by the SPC, SC8 reviewed the effectiveness of
CMM 2011-01 to reduce fishing mortality of bigeye tuna (BET), the effectiveness of CMM 2008-01, and provided
scientific advice to the WCPFC for the development of a revised CMM for BET, YFT, and SKJ tuna stocks.  SPC also
approximated the impact of the various exemptions contained within CMM 2008-01, estimating that if the CMM was
implemented without exemptions, approximately half of the overfishing  that is estimated could occur under the
CMM as written could be removed (reduction of BET F/FMSY from 1.35 to 1.17).10  The SC8 maintains that the catch
of small BET, YFT and SKJ can be significantly reduced by purse seines switching from FAD sets to unassociated
sets.11
Nonetheless, the SC8 specifically noted that CMM-2008-01 has not reduced the fishing mortality for BET to the level
intended and supports the need for additional or alternative targeted measures to reduce the fishing mortality on
BET.12  Since a reduction in fishing mortality on BET has not reached the intended level, additional targeted
measures to reduce the fishing mortality on BET must be considered for all gear types.  Indeed, the FFA member
states emphatically support the need for additional or alternative targeted measures to reduce the fishing mortality
on BET.13  In  the  event  that  these  additional  measures  continue  to  fail  to  adequately  address  BET  mortality,  the
WCPFC must consider even stronger measures and/or fewer exemptions to the rules.
If overfishing of BET continues to occur, the WCPFC must consider more extreme measures, including a complete
periodic  closure  to  all  purse  seine  fishing  with  no,  or  at  least  very  minimal,  exemptions.   For  the  closure  to  be
meaningful, the WCPFC must impose the closure around the time of the greatest catch/catch rates of juvenile BET
and  over  a  length  of  time  sufficient  to  bring  BET  mortality  near  the  reference  point.   While  it  may  seem  drastic,
another RFMO has previously successfully used a complete periodic closure to control BET mortality.  The IATTC
successfully implemented a similar measure to control the BET mortality within a small percentage of the reference
point used in their management, thereby proving its efficacy in an analogous situation.  WWF acknowledges that this
action could potentially have significant adverse socioeconomic impacts, particularly on Small Island Developing
States (SIDS), and recommends exploring mitigation measures as part of the consideration of such a measure.
Furthermore, the complete closure would need to coincide with additional measures imposed on other gear types as
well.
The WCPFC must support the SC8 recommendations for development of a revised CMM for BET, YFT and SKJ tuna
stocks.  Specifically, the SC8 notes that the catch of small BET, YFT and SKJ can be significantly reduced by purse
seines switching from FAD sets to unassociated sets.
WWF supports the SC8 recommendation for development of a revised CMM for BET, YFT and SKJ
tuna stocks.  Consistent with this recommendation, the WCPFC must:
�
Adapt and adopt management measures that apply to all sectors of the fishery;
�
Further strengthen the control of FAD activities;
�
Build  on  the  apparent  success  of  some  fleets  in  reducing  their  dependence  on  FADs  to
achieve greater control of FAD activity outside the closures, including control of the number
of FADs set throughout a year instead of FAD time closures;
�
Implement  an  absolute  reduction  of  the  total  number  of  FAD  sets  to  the  levels  no  greater
than those in the fishery in 2010;
�
Clearly define limits on purse seine effort that are applicable in different areas;
�
Implement measures which reduce fishing mortality on BET from the longline fishery; and
�
Consider a complete closure of the purse seine fishery for a defined period of time during the
highest catch or catch rates of juvenile BET, including any mitigation measures necessary to
address adverse socioeconomic impacts.
Yellowfin Tuna
Although the SPC did not conduct a stock assessment for YFT this year, anecdotal accounts of continued declining
CPUE indicate a corresponding decline in stock status warranting action to halt and reverse the declining trend.
WCPFC should observe the precautionary approach and support the SC7 recommendation to the WCPFC to limit
YFT fishing mortality to its 2001-2004 level.  The conclusion provided in the SC7 Summary Report based on the
most recent assessment of YFT (2011) in the WCPO indicates that overfishing is not occurring and that the stock is
not in an overfished state.  However, the stock assessment does continue to indicate a negative trend towards an

overfished state that warrants a precautionary approach to the management of the stock.  Additionally, reduced catch
levels  support  additional  measures  as  the  WCP-CA  YFT  catch  for  2011  (430,506  mt  –  19%)  was  the  lowest  since
1996.14  WWF  recommends  that  the  WCPFC  take  proactive  and  precautionary  measures  to  prevent  the  further
decline of the YFT stock.
WWF recommends that the WCPFC take proactive and precautionary measures to prevent any
further decline of the YFT stock and that WCPFC must:
�
Implement the SC7 recommendation to the WCPFC to limit YFT fishing mortality to its 2001-
2004 level in the western equatorial region.15
Pacific Bluefin Tuna
CMM 2010-04 for Pacific Bluefin tuna requires member states to ensure that the total fishing effort by their vessels
stays below the 2002-04 level for 2011 and 2012.  This measure might be successful, but for all of the exceptions
carved out, such that the exceptions become the rule.  While a minor exception for artisanal fisheries likely has a
negligible effect, the additional exceptions to the measures intended to reduce juvenile Bluefin tuna mortality to
2002-2004 levels confound the success of the CMM.  The WCPFC must remove all current exemptions from CMM-
2010-04 and encourage all fishing nations to implement the substantial management measures for juvenile (age0-3)
PBT to keep fishing mortality of PBT to no more than its 2002-2004 fishing mortality level.
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Revise CMM-2010-04 and remove all current exemptions from CMM-2010-04; and
�
Encourage all member states to implement the substantial management measures for
juvenile (age 0-3) PBT to keep fishing mortality less than its 2002-2004 level.
South Pacific Albacore Tuna
The SC7 noted in 2011 that harvest levels of the exploitable biomass has increased sharply in recent years, raising
concerns of potential overfishing in the near future and the need for additional restrictions of fishing mortality.
WWF remains concerned about the recent rapid and uncontrolled growth in the longline fleet throughout the WCPO.
Particularly, this growth appears to be contributing to several adverse impacts to Southern ALB tuna and possible
localised depletion of the adult stock in some areas.  Furthermore, verifiable increased effort south of 20�S on the
juvenile migrating stock appears to be contributing to a reduction in biomass, which is also resulting in the stock
rapidly approaching MSY.
The SC8 confirmed that the WCP-CA ALB longline catch for 2011 was the second highest on record (96,219 mt), but
represents a 6,000 mt decline from the 2010 record (102,763 mt). Meanwhile, all fleets are reportedly currently
experiencing significant reductions in catch per unit effort (CPUE) in response to the increase in adult fishing
mortality, thereby providing a strong indication of a drop in biomass.  Therefore, the effectiveness of the WCPFC
CMM 2005-02, as amended in 2010, to conserve the Southern ALB stock, remains questionable.  While the current
state of the Southern ALB stock remains within biological limits, the goal of the WCPFC should be to keep it there
rather than to allow a continued trend of decline in the fishery. Furthermore, WWF maintains substantial concerns
that the persistent increase in ALB effort will also significantly impact other target species facing conservation
concerns such as BET and YFT as well as sharks.
WWF supports the efforts of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), Te Vaka
Moana (TVM), the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA), the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG), other Pacific
Island Countries (PICs) with target ALB fisheries, the Pacific Islands Tuna Industry Association (PITIA) and other
non-aligned parties to strengthen the management strategy for the ALB longline fishery and to address the related
species interaction issues.  WWF would specifically like to reemphasize the concerns expressed by the FFA at SC8
regarding the doubling of catch since 2000, declining CPUE, and increase in effort (including influx of vessels from
the Indian Ocean, increase in domestic fleet size, and more high seas fishing) for South Pacific ALB..16  Measures
aimed at introducing effective capacity limits and effort management must be urgently addressed by WCPFC and the
region’s domestic fisheries managers.  The following recommendations are consistent with the policy paper
commissioned by WWF regarding South Pacific ALB tuna that was submitted to the WCPFC in March 2012.17
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Introduce effective capacity and effort controls for management of the South Pacific ALB
stock; and
WWF Statement to the WCPFC – 9th Regular Session, Manila, Philippines, 2-6 December 2012

WWF POSITION
�
Encourage domestic fisheries managers to implement Tuna Management Plans that freeze
licenses for ALB at current levels and seek to reduce that number to a level that achieves
Maximum Economic Yield.
Bycatch
WWF believes that WCPFC must take decisive management action to avoid and mitigate bycatch in all WCPO
fisheries and ensure the relevant scientific body is able to improve bycatch related information through such tools as
the Bycatch Management Information System (BMIS).  WWF further recommends that the WCPFC strengthen the
long-term management of bycatch levels and mitigation options, including to review and revise management actions
on bycatch as information increases as well as take action to strengthen capacity to manage and monitor compliance
with conservation and management measures.
A group of environmental NGOs (including WWF and TRAFFIC) developed a Compendium of Best Practice of
Conservation and Management Measures (CMMs) for the bycatch species taxonomic groups in 2011.18  The NGOs
prepared four CMMs on the basis of the best available scientific advice and taking into account current practice
within tuna RFMOs. The proposed CMMs cover the following four taxonomic groups including seabirds, sharks, sea
turtles, and marine mammals.  WWF encourages the WCPFC to consider these proposed CMMs in its own approach
to addressing bycatch issues.
Whale Sharks
The whale shark is a tropical and warm temperate species, the world’s largest living chondrichthyan, and justifiably
considered a “charismatic megafauna.”  Although scientists currently understand relatively little of its life history, it
is  known  to  be  highly  fecund  and  to  migrate  extremely  large  distances.   However,  populations  of  whale  shark
continue  to  show  a  declining  trend  globally  and  the  species  is  listed  in  Appendix  II  to  the  Convention  for
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Appendix II to the Convention for
Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), and as “vulnerable” in the International Union for the Conservation of
Nature’s (IUCN) Red List.  The whale shark’s high value in international trade, a K-selected life history, highly
migratory nature, and normally low abundance make this species especially vulnerable to commercial fishing
activities.  Therefore, the WCPFC must take steps to restrict activities that are detrimental to the continued health of
the whale shark population in the WCPO.
It  is  well  known  that  whale  sharks  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  being  encircled  by  purse  seine  nets,  due  to  the
propensity of tuna to form schools around them.  Additionally, it has become well known that observer reports on
fishing activities by vessels flagged to CCMs indicate numerous instances of interactions with whale sharks in
addition to high mortality rates for encircled whale sharks and instances of misreporting whale shark interactions in
vessel logbook.19  At least 75 whale sharks were recorded as mortalities in the purse seine fishery in 2009 and 2010
alone.20
Thus, measures should be taken by the WCPFC to protect this ecologically important and vulnerable shark species.
Consistent with the recent actions of the PNA to prohibit setting of purse seines on cetaceans and whale sharks in
their waters and Australia’s recommendation for a similar provision, the WCPFC should adopt an explicit prohibition
on the setting of purse seines on whale sharks.
WWF recommends that the WCPFC should:
�
Acknowledge the SC8 conclusion that whale sharks meet the criteria for consideration as a
key shark species and define whale sharks as a key shark species.
�
Adopt Australia’s Proposal to Address the Impact of Purse Seine Fishing Activity on Whale
Sharks, which includes a specific prohibition for setting purse seines on whale sharks.
�
Support procedures for the careful and safe release of whale sharks inadvertently captured
in purse seines.
�
Recommend requirements for logbook and observer reporting of all interactions with whale
sharks for submission to the flag State and to the WCPFC.
�
Encourage the development of reference points for non-target species, including whale
sharks, as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention.¶
Oceanic Whitetip and Silky Sharks
At SC8 in Busan, Korea, the Scientific Services Provider offered strong scientific evidence that both oceanic whitetip
sharks and silky sharks are currently overfished and subject to overfishing.21  Thus, existing management
measures to reduce fishing mortality have insufficiently addressed the continuing decline of oceanic whitetip and
silky sharks.

WWF POSITION
WCPFC has taken efforts to rebuild spawning biomass of oceanic whitetip sharks as agreed under CMM 2011-04.
However, managers and scientists note that additional mitigation measures to avoid capture and mortality of oceanic
whitetip and silky sharks is warranted.22
Based on the recommendations of the SC8 regarding oceanic whitetip and silky sharks, the WCPFC
must:
�
Endorse additional mitigation measures and maintain existing measures in an effort to
improve the status of the WCPO oceanic whitetip and silky shark stocks including:
o
prohibit the retention, transhipment, storage, on-board sale, and landing of oceanic
whitetip and silky sharks in all fisheries managed by the WCPFC;
o
mandate the prompt and careful release of any captured oceanic whitetip and silky
sharks; and
o
ensure that all interactions with oceanic whitetip and silky sharks are reported in terms
of number and status of animals through logbooks and observer records.
�
Encourage the development of reference points for non-target species, including oceanic
whitetip  sharks  and  silky  sharks,  as  envisaged  under  Articles  5  and  10  of  the  WCPF
Convention.¶
Shark Finning
Shark finning is defined as the practice of removing the fins from a shark and discarding the carcass.  The WCPFC
has already taken initial steps to regulate shark finning. However, recent research indicates that these efforts are
largely inadequate as the practice of calculating a “fin to carcass” ratio allows fishermen to retain more high value fins
through highgrading and hence fails to address the necessary management needs of many of the shark species which
are currently subject to overfishing.
At  least  four  independent  studies  show  that  a  fin  to  carcass  ratio  fails  to  accurately  assess  removals  and  largely
prevents the effective identification of shark species.23  Furthermore, the ultimate conclusion of a 2006 assessment of
the validity of the 5% fin-to-carcass ratio from a collective volume of scientific papers produced by the International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) states that, “The only guaranteed method to avoid shark
finning is to land sharks with all fins attached.”24
The WCPFC should strongly support the “fins naturally attached” method as the most reliable means for enforcing a
shark finning ban.  A prohibition of at-sea fin removals under a “fins naturally attached” policy:
�
Greatly reduces enforcement burden;
�
Substantially improves information on species and quantities of sharks landed;
�
Virtually eliminates the practice of “highgrading” where bodies and fins from different animals are mixed,
conflating prohibitions on the retention of certain species; and
�
Increases the value of the finished product.
Additionally, making a partial cut that allows fins to be folded against the body has been proven to address industry
concerns about safety and storage.  Because of the numerous practical advantages associated with the fins naturally
attached method, the policy has been mandated for most Central American and U.S. fisheries, and internationally.
More importantly, WWF maintains concerns that too much focus is placed on finning measures.  WWF believes that
finning prohibitions tend to divert attention from assessing the overall sustainability of shark harvests and that shark
management should not be based on seemingly simple measures that lack even the potential for proper evaluation
and enforcement.25
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Focus  more  discretely  on  the  overall  management  of  shark  harvests  including  the
development and implementation of reference points for non-target species as envisaged
under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPFC Convention;
�
Support and promote the collection of species-specific shark catch data in the WCPO through
observer records and logbooks;
�
Implement a requirement for all sharks be landed with their fins naturally attached, allowing
for a “partial cut method” to facilitate safety and storage; and
WWF Statement to the WCPFC – 9th Regular Session, Manila, Philippines, 2-6 December 2012

WWF POSITION
�
Until such time a “fins attached” policy is enacted, implement a prohibition on the transfer of
any unattached shark fins at sea.¶
Turtles
WWF  believes  that  CMM  2008-03  for  the  Conservation  and  Management  of  Sea  Turtles  has  not  demonstrably
reduced bycatch impacts on threatened and endangered sea turtles in the region, and that the cumulative impact of
longline vessels in the WCPO on sea turtles remains problematic.  Furthermore, evidence suggests that the WCPFC
and  member  states  have  not  suitably  monitored  the  CMM  for  effectiveness  with  some  parts  of  the  CMM
distinguished as providing “excessive room for creative compliance.”26
Although CMM 2008-03 requires all longline vessels to carry turtle de-hookers and line cutters, and to foster the
animal’s recovery according to WCPFC handling and mitigation guidelines, WCPFC has provided no documentation
of the effectiveness of or compliance with this requirement, despite the explicit identification of data collection and
minimum surveillance resources.27  Indeed, in 2010 over three quarters of CCMs either did not report on compliance
with  CMM  2008-03  or  did  not  meet  all  the  CMM  measures.28  Furthermore, only a small fraction of member
countries have conducted dedicated research on sea turtle mitigation techniques, and current observer coverage falls
well below the recommended level for effectively determining optimal mitigation approaches (i.e. 10% coverage over
3 years).
The precautionary principle requires that all members must determine optimal bycatch mitigation strategies based
on research and sound science.  With no evidence of CMM 2008-03 having slowed or reversed negative trends on
threatened  and  endangered  sea  turtle  populations,  the  burden  of  proof  remains  on  the  WCPFC  and  the  CCMs  to
demonstrate minimization of bycatch impacts in longline operations.  The best way to improve compliance with the
CMM is to revise the CMM to ensure more suitable requirements for the determination of optimal bycatch mitigation
packages for individual fisheries, reduce the ambiguity in the language, and improve the definition of the desired
outcomes of the CMM.  WWF maintains that revisions to the CMM are necessary to better enable compliance and
because we believe that substantial evidence exists that current measures have failed to minimize impacts on sea
turtles under the current CMM, thereby further obligating implementation of stronger measures.  Therefore, WWF
believes that CMM 2008-03 for the Conservation and Management of Sea Turtles has not demonstrably reduced
bycatch impacts on threatened and endangered sea turtles in the region, and that the cumulative impact of longline
vessels in the WCPO on sea turtles remains problematic.
Thus, with respect to sea turtles, the WCPFC should:
�
Formally acknowledge the deficiencies of CMM 2008-03;
�
Adopt the sea turtle conservation and management measures proposed by WWF in the
Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures (CMMs);29
�
Develop and implement CMM revisions aimed at:
o
Strengthening key language and reducing the ambiguity in desired outcomes of the
CMM, thereby enabling not only stronger conservation measures but also better
monitoring of CMM effectiveness;
o
Committing explicitly to a goal of zero mortality of sea turtles and catch rates as close to
zero as possible;
o
Introducing new interim binding measures including mandatory adoption of bycatch
reduction gear (e.g. circle hooks) and other mitigation techniques, conducting research
on  mitigation  techniques,  and  reporting  on  sea  turtle  impacts,  with  a  goal  of  later
implementing a consolidated optimal bycatch mitigation package;
o
Setting an appropriate interim catch rate that would trigger move-on provisions; and
o
Taking appropriate actions to ensure observer coverage in the longline fleet reaches
recommended  minimum  levels  with  a  view  to  progressively  phase  in  100%  observer
coverage.
�
Revive efforts to ensure the appropriate monitoring and documentation of compliance with
CMM 2008-03 9and any revisions to the CMM) ensuring that member countries are meeting
minimum data collection and surveillance requirements; and
�
Reconstitute efforts to clearly communicate the ecological and economic benefits of circle
hook adoption and sea turtle mitigation techniques to CCMs and their fleets.
Seabirds
WWF supports the advice from delegates of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP)
that the following seabird bycatch mitigation measures represent the current best practices:

weighted branch lines
�
night setting
�
bird scaring (tori) lines
The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the Indian Ocean Tuna
Commission in November 2011 and April 2012 respectively, passed new conservation measures that required
member states to use 2 out of 3 seabird bycatch mitigation measures south of 25°S in their areas of competence,
choosing between night setting, bird-scaring (tori) lines and line weighting. The greatest areas of risk of the adverse
effects of fishing mortality on seabird populations in the southern hemisphere of the WCPFC area occur from 25 to
50°S, particularly in the Tasman Sea.30
WWF supports the SC8 recommendation that a combination of techniques should be used, especially those including
the best practices listed above that have proven most effective for reducing seabird bycatch of the prevalent seabirds
in the regions of concern.  Additionally, WWF supports the SC8 recommendation to include observer data fields on:
the mass of weight added to branch lines, distance between weight and hook (in meters), the fate (dead, alive or
injured), and number of seabirds by species in each of these categories.31
The WCPFC should reconsider analysis on the impacts of implementing seabird avoidance gear on vessels less than
24 meters as it would be largely redundant in lieu of considerable research that has been conducted in other longline
fisheries which proves vessels as small as 8 meters can successfully and economically deploy seabird avoidance
gear.32
As a bycatch species of concern in the WCPO, WWF remains committed to reducing the capture and mortality of
seabirds in the tuna longline fisheries.  WWF supports the recommendations of the Agreement on the Conservation
of ACAP and the SC8 regarding seabird conservation.
Thus, with respect to seabirds, WWF recommends the WCPFC should:
�
Adopt the seabird conservation measures recommended by ACAP as the best practice for
longline operations, including the use of weighted branch lines, night setting, and bird
scaring (tori) lines;
�
Endorse  the  use  of  2  out  of  3  of  the  seabird  bycatch  best  practices  on  all  longline  vessels
fishing south of 25°S; and
�
Consider implementation of the seabird bycatch best practices throughout the WCPFC CA
where incidence of seabird interaction warrants mitigation measures.
Monitoring and Compliance
Catch Documentation Scheme
WWF continues to believe that an efficient and comprehensive catch documentation scheme (CDS) is a necessary
part of a well-managed fishery.  Good catch documentation is essential to proper fisheries management, providing
the data necessary for analyses as basic as stock assessments to the product traceability that seafood markets are
increasingly demanding.  WWF supports the development and implementation of a comprehensive CDS and
encourages the future development of the CDS by the WCPFC.
Overall, WWF wishes to note that any CDS considered by the CDS working group must be fully comprehensive to be
effective, including documentation of all catches, landings, transfers, and trade.  Other RFMOs provide relevant
examples of CDS schemes that were not robust enough to provide adequate documentation.  For instance, the
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) switched from a purely trade-based scheme to a
more comprehensive CDS because the initial program allowed for substantial overharvest by one of its members
resulting  from  the  trade-based  scheme  not  being  inclusive  of  all  catches,  landings  and  trade.   Thus,  any  CDS
considered by the CDS working group must include all catches, landings, transfers, or trade part of the framework for
the documentation schemes, not just the trade-based information.
As part of the CDS development, WWF requests that the WCPFC consider certain key features of a
good CDS system, including:
�
A requirement for electronic documentation to accompany all catch harvested, landed,
transhipped, traded domestically, exported, processed, imported and re-exported;
�
Complementary measures to maximize the effectiveness of the CDS through:
o
ensuring that transhipment at sea does not compromise the effectiveness of the CDS;
WWF Statement to the WCPFC – 9th Regular Session, Manila, Philippines, 2-6 December 2012

WWF POSITION
o
adopting Port State Measures implemented simultaneously with the CDS; and
o
adopting trade restriction measures against flag States with vessels on the IUU list.
�
Parameters that include all species of tunas, billfish, and sharks managed by the WCPFC;
�
A  commitment  to  continuous  improvement  of  the  CDS  by  investigating  the  benefits  and
feasibility of verification systems such as electronic tagging and the use of biotechnology;
�
Establishment of a capacity development fund to provide a cost-sharing mechanism that
enables progressive cost sharing among member states; and
�
Maximizing retailer and public access to data through modern electronic tools.
Regional Observer Programme
Information collected as part of an appropriate observer programme is critically important to the proper
management of a fishery.  Data collected by observers plays a central role in informing fisheries scientists on
everything ranging from stock assessments to non-target species impacts.  Furthermore, observers play an
indispensable role in monitoring and enforcing very important conservation and management measures in the
WCPO.  Indeed, observers represent the vanguard of fisheries management through the science and service that they
provide.  Thus, observer coverage must be considered a top priority and greater support must be provided to the
relevant authority to see that the capacity of the ROP is strengthened.
First and foremost, the WCPFC must take steps to actually implement a consistent and consolidated set of standards
for  the  ROP.   At  this  time,  despite  references  to  an  ambiguous  “Hybrid  Model,”  the  WCPFC  has  no  identifiable
standards or definitions for the ROP.33  This leads to variations in interpretation, inconsistency in application of
existing measures, and, ultimately, contributes to poor quality, inconsistent, or unreliable data being introduced to
the  management  system.   Additionally,  as  part  of  developing  the  standards,  the  WCPFC  must  develop  clear,
unambiguous definitions for subjective terms currently used within the operation of the ROP.  The quality of the data
produced by the ROP depends heavily on the quality of the program in place.  Therefore, the WCPFC must take steps
to better refine the standards and operating procedures for the ROP.
Second, the WCPFC must ensure, through appropriate guidance, that national observer programmes administered
under the ROP are fully resourced in terms of human and financial capital as well as governed under appropriate
administrative and management structures.  The WCPFC should consider an analysis that considers and presents
different funding models that CCMs could consider for ensuring proper administrative and management of the
observer program at a national level.  In any event, more attention must be given to the development of minimum
standards that ensure a national programme can perform to ROP standards, including such efforts as annual reviews
of the national programs under pre-agreed performance standards.
Third, WWF maintains significant concerns regarding the independence of onboard observers from the perspective
of data integrity.  The independence and the security of the observer must be paramount to ensure data integrity.
Therefore, WWF recommends that any observer funding model considered must avoid even the perception of conflict
of interest.  This means establishing a 3rd party payment system that insulates the observer from direct payment by
the vessel owner or operator, which constitutes an unequivocal financial conflict of interest.34  WWF suggests that the
WCPFC  carefully  research  funding  models  that  ensure  that  observer  providers  can  provide  timely  and  secure
payments to observers without having those payments made directly to the observer by the vessel owner or operator.
Specifically, WWF believes that a “Pre-payment Model” that would require funding observer placement through an
independent 3rd party agent could potentially provide the necessary insulation from undue influence by the vessel
owner or operator while also ensuring that the observer is properly paid and transported to their home of record at
the  conclusion  of  their  service.   Thus,  WWF  asks  the  WCPFC  to  urgently  pursue  measures  to  ensure  the
independence of observers.
Related to observer independence, WWF insists that the WCPFC implement stronger requirements to ensure the
health, safety, and welfare of all observers serving in the WCPFC.  Very few measures exist to protect observers from
bribery, threats, intimidation, or harassment.  Recent anecdotal and documented information confirms that
observers are consistently subject to different forms of harassment that impede their ability to properly do their jobs
as well as impact their physical safety and well-being while on the vessel.  When a vessel operator, owner, fish master,
crewmember, or anyone else interferes with the official duties of an observer, they directly obstruct the collection of
scientific data that will ultimately decide the sustainable management of their fishery.  WWF believes that
interference with an observer directly results in unreported data subject to sanctions under the UN FAO standards
for Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated fishing.35  Therefore, WWF urges not only that the WCPFC put in place
discrete provisions to protect observers from interference, but also implement an administrative process that
protects both the vessel and the observer through a well-defined and transparent administrative review procedure.
Any violation against an observer that is confirmed through the administrative review should result in the offending
vessel being placed on the IUU list.

WWF POSITION
From a technical perspective, WWF previously noted and once again remarks that no current impediment exists for
all support vessels to have 100% observer coverage such as the measures currently enforced for purse seine vessels.
Furthermore, WWF advocates that 100% observer coverage be phased in for longline vessels, including potential
Electronic Monitoring programs to reduce the cost and feasibility of on board observation.  WWF continues to call
for a 3-year phase in of 100% ROP coverage for all fishing and support vessels including:
�
Year 1:  In an effort to effectively enforce transshipment requirements, all support vessels (resupply,
refueling, reefers) for all high seas fishing must have 100% ROP coverage, which may include an approved
equivalent Electronic Monitoring system;36
�
Year 1:  20% of all longline vessels (including at least one from each flag state) have an ROP observer or
approved equivalent Electronic Monitoring system on board;
�
Year 2:  50% of all longline vessels (including more than half of all vessels from each flag state) have an ROP
observer or approved equivalent Electronic Monitoring system on board; and
�
Year 3:  100% of all longline vessels have an ROP observer or approved equivalent Electronic Monitoring
system on board.
Other fisheries around the world have demonstrated varying levels of success using EM in limited circumstances,
depending on the goal of the observation and data collection program.  Therefore, each application of EM is
contextual and must be subject to thorough analysis, comprehensive testing, and careful monitoring to ensure the
technology and program is functioning as designed. WWF would like to acknowledge the important role that EM
could potentially play in ensuring observer coverage throughout the WCPFC CA, possibly even at a reduced cost, but
noting that there will always be a need for human observers to perform certain analytical tasks that a camera, sensor,
or computer simply cannot accomplish.
The observer program is a critical link to ensure the sustainability of the WCPO tuna fisheries for future generations
in the SIDS.  In some cases, nations’ access to fisheries constitute their only source of revenue and as such must be
recognized for its importance to those communities through strong conservation and management measures
designed to ensure the long term sustainability of those fisheries.  In addition to the benefits of improved compliance
and enhanced traceability, a solid, well-functioning observer program can help ensure access by member states to
important, high-value markets that seek to source from fisheries with transparent measures conducted in accordance
with international best practices.
With respect to the continued implementation and operation of the ROP, the WCPFC must:
�
Implement a binding, consistent, and consolidated set of standards for the ROP;
�
Conduct a phased implementation of 100% observer coverage on all fishing and support
vessels;
�
Revise the Observer Provider Code of Conduct to create more substantive requirements
on  Observer  Providers  and  recipients,  including  the  implementation  of  a  schedule  of
fines and sanctions for non-compliance to be applicable to throughout the WCPFC CA;
�
Develop  and  implement  strong  set  of  Minimum  Observer  Health,  Safety,  and  Welfare
Standards to be applicable to all vessels operating throughout the WCPFC CA;
�
Develop and implement a standardized administrative review system to address observer
grievances that is empowered to impose sanctions and/or penalties on offending vessel
owners, captains, masters, and/or crew, who engage in bribery, threats, intimidation, or
harassment of any kind against an observer which would otherwise impede them from
conducting their official duties; and
�
Implement a Conservation and Management Measure stating that any finding from an
administrative  review  that  confirms  an  instance  of  bribery,  threats,  intimidation,  or
harassment of an observer constitutes an IUU violation resulting in the vessel on which
the offense occurred being placed on the IUU list;
�
Consider EM in situations deemed appropriate for enforcement and monitoring goals
specific to those vessels considered;
�
Reconstitute  the  Data  Consultative  Committee  (DCC)  to  address  current  data  issues  in
the ROP, including consideration of:
o
Revisions of data fields for non-target species to include detailed entries for seabirds,
turtles, and sharks, broken out by species, in all observer reporting submissions; and

WWF POSITION
o
Removal of redundant, duplicative, or otherwise obsolete data fields; and
�
Develop a more comprehensive analysis and design plan for spatially and temporally
representative observer coverage of each fishery operating in the WCPFC CA.
IUU Measures
WWF would like to commend the WCPFC efforts to address IUU listing procedures under WCPFC CMM 2010-06 to
ensure effectiveness and harmonization with other RFMO procedures.  The IUU list provides an effective deterrent
against vessel owners, operators, and companies who would otherwise reap the unjustified benefits of a fishery
without being subject to the rules by which the rest of the fishery must abide.
The WCPFC must maintain strong procedures for identifying, listing, and retaining IUU vessels on
IUU Lists to ensure that the integrity of the WCPO fisheries including:
�
Ensuring the burden of proof must always remain with the IUU offender to explicitly prove
through  appropriate  documentation   (WCPFC  CMM  2010-06  paragraph  25  a-e)  that  all
obligations have been met before being removed from an IUU list;
�
Maintaining the current definition of IUU fishing for the purpose of the IUU list; and
�
Ensuring that “sanctions of adequate severity” are always onerous enough to prevent, deter,
and eliminate any future IUU conduct and not just a “cost of doing business.”
Data and Statistics
One of the most important features of a fully functioning fisheries management regime is the supply of timely and
accurate data for use in stock assessments and decision making processes.  The SC8 noted that several CCMs still
have not provided operational catch/effort data and none of these CCMs have submitted a Data Improvement Plan,
as recommended by WCPFC7.37  To ensure that all fisheries under the WCPFC’s responsibility are sustainably
managed, the WCPFC must continually seek improvements in data collection and analysis.
WWF recommends that the WCPFC should:
�
Repeat the request for CCMs who have yet to provide operational level catch and effort data
provide Data Improvement Plans to the WCPFC; and
�
Request that, until operational catch/effort data are provided, non-compliant CCMs must
provide annual catch estimates by gear and species for waters of national jurisdiction and
high seas areas separately, as per the scientific data provision rules of the WCPFC.
Miscellaneous
Cost Recovery and Optimisation
WWF is concerned that the proposal to enact additional costs on non-government observers could impose an undue
financial hardship on prospective attendees of the WCPFC official meetings.  At a cost of US$500 per meeting for two
attendees as well as a US$350 per person fee for each additional attendee as proposed in the COST RECOVERY AND
THE OPTIMISATION OF COMMISSION SERVICE COSTS Report (WCPFC-TCC8-2012/IP12), this could effectively
make attendance prohibitively expensive for many non-government and community service organizations.  In effect,
this action would disenfranchise many stakeholders who have direct economic and social interests in the sustainable
management of the WCPO fishery resources.
We wish to note that the report acknowledges that the additional costs imposed by attendance of non-government
organizations are “relatively minor” and should not justify an imposition of those fees on less financially capable
stakeholders.  Additionally, the WCPFC is not subject to the same level of expense as other RFMOs where such fees
are in place to support a high degree of interpretation and translation costs.  Some observers also provide additional
independently funded research and analysis to the WCPFC, contributing to new knowledge and understanding of
complex issues.  Furthermore, the report also notes that “Observers have the opportunity to observe the Commission,
participate in meetings, and to put forward their views [while] the Commission gains credibility from having
transparent processes at its meetings and a chance to receive and respond to observers’ view.”  This transparency is
critical to the commission’s operation and credibility.  By imposing such an undue financial burden on observers –
the public stakeholders – WCPFC only serves to diminish the effectiveness and reputation of the RFMO process and,
in the end, the outcomes that result.
WWF recommends that the WCPFC must:
�
Oppose the implementation of a fee for observers to attend WCPFC meetings.
