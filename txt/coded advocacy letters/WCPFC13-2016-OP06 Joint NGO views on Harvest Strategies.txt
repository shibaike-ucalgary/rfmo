Dear Delegates, 
 
This letter is submitted on behalf of the undersigned non-governmental 
organizations and fishing industry organizations that participate in the Western and 
Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) process, or may seek to do so in the 
future.  
 
Collectively our organizations work in more than 100 countries and work with 
industry, engage suppliers and/or provide advice to retailers, buyers and food 
service sectors regarding improvements in tuna sustainability.  In addition, the 
undersigned organizations work with or represent many purse seine, longline, pole 
and line and handline vessels active in tuna fisheries and recognize that the 
sustainability of tuna stocks is integral to businesses as well as the health of the 
marine environment.  
 
We are writing to bring to your attention our views on the development of harvest 
strategies – an issue we believe is fundamental to sustainable fisheries management 
-- and one that necessitates immediate action by the WCPFC.  
 
We recognize that the Commission has made some initial progress in recent years to 
establish basic science-based management measures to ensure the sustainability of 
the world’s largest tuna fishery in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. 
Specifically, in 2015 the Commission committed itself to implement a six-part 
harvest strategy approach for each of the key fisheries or stocks under its 
management, including a work plan with clear timelines.  We support this action, 
and encourage the Commission to apply the Precautionary Approach using clear 
target and limit reference points and harvest control rules, as called for by the 
United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement.  
 
As you prepare for the upcoming 13th Session of the Commission, we urge your 
government to support the full and timely implementation of the Work Plan for 
harvest strategies, including timelines to adopt appropriate biologically-based 
target reference points, harvest control rules and the other elements of the harvest 
strategy approach, for skipjack, bigeye, yellowfin and south Pacific albacore tuna.  In 
particular, we urge you to ensure the Commission takes the decisions necessary this 
year (e.g., agree on acceptable levels of risk, a rebuilding time frame for bigeye, and 
management objectives for south Pacific albacore, skipjack, bigeye and yellowfin) to 
allow management strategy evaluation and other work to proceed as scheduled in 
 
2 
2017.  For northern albacore, we recognize the ISC's efforts on MSE-related work 
and encourage continued progress on harvest strategy development consistent 
with the agreed 2017-2019 Work Plan, including determination of a target 
reference point together with other elements of harvest strategies. 
 
In addition, we request your support for proposals that would establish 
precautionary target reference points for south Pacific albacore and performance 
indicators to evaluate harvest control rules for south Pacific albacore and skipjack 
tuna.  Finally, in order to optimize harvest control rules for all tuna stocks in the 
future, we suggest that the Commission request regular updates from your scientific 
advisors regarding reference points and performance indicators, and development 
of a monitoring strategy to assess performance against reference points. 
 
We urge the WCPFC to take these actions at its upcoming Commission Meeting in 
December in Fiji as a matter of priority.
