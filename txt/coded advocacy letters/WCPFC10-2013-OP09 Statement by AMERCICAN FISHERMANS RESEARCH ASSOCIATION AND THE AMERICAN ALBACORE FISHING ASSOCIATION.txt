1.   Exploration and Development of the Fishery 
 
 
Starting in the mid-1980s the American Fishermens Research Foundation (a 
501c(3) corporation funded by the harvester,   processor,   and supplier members 
of the Western Fishboat Owners Association) joined with the U.S. Government’s 
Pacific Fisheries Development Foundation to explore and expand the troll fishery 
for South Pacific albacore.1     The total budget for the first phase was $287,800, the 
federal share $115,000 and the AFRF’s share $172,800.   The project was to send 
two to four albacore troll vessels, 60-80 feet in length, with crews of 2 to 4,   to 
the South Pacific to develop a U.S. albacore fishery and to do albacore tagging. 
The U.S. vessels, in cooperation with New Zealand, were given permission (by Dr. 
Robin Allen, then with the New Zealand Government) to enter the New Zealand 
EEZ in the area near Chatham Island.   New Zealand thought obtaining data from 
the U.S. cruises would be a good idea since: 
 
 
. . . our knowledge of albacore distribution and commercial potential 
along the east coast is poor, these vessels would provide valuable data 
for expanding NZ albacore fishing . . . and an opportunity to see 
innovations used in the North Pacific high seas albacore trolling 
fishery.2 
 
 
During February and March of 1986 two troll vessels, sometimes 
accompanied by NOAA’s research vessel, the Townsend Cromwell, fished in 
waters between 38° and 41° S and 140° to 155° W and caught 100mt of albacore 
while tagging 702 albacore. 
 
 
A second phase of the 3 year project followed, with the U.S. supplying 
$360,000 and AFRF supplying $180,000 for a total of over a half a million dollars, 
to send 6 U.S. troll vessels to fish for albacore during December 1986 to April of 
1987.   Eventually, 40 troll vessels went fishing in the area catching 4,000 mt in 
the 1987 to 1988 season, while tagging 1,247 albacore. 
 
 
1 At that time most of the current members of the American Albacore Fishing Association were 
members of WFOA.

A third phase was conducted in December 1988 to April 1989 at an 
additional cost of $129,000 with the U.S. government and AFRF again sharing the 
costs.   This part of the project was to send 40 albacore troll vessels to tag 2,000 
albacore in the South Pacific fishing area. 
 
 
The thrust of this effort was to develop a fishery which could deliver to the 
two canneries in American Samoa.   Canneries in California and Hawaii had been 
closed.   Also in 1988, there had been a large influx of Asian drift gillnet vessels 
taking albacore in the North and South Pacific.   A log book sheet attached to one 
of the reports from the 1988-1989 season had the entry that “Because of gilnet 
[sic] damage, we are tagging small fish to get the quality of fish you specified . . . 
75% of the fish we are catching are gilnet [sic] marked . . . .”   3 
 
 
The U.S. fleet was not alone in its efforts which resulted in the tagging of 
3,783 albacore between 1986 and 1989.   In cooperation with AFRF, New Zealand 
tagged 1,866 albacore and French Polynesia tagged 190.   The New Zealand 
tagging occurred near shore on the west and east coast of the North Island.   The 
U.S. tagging occurred between 170° and 140° W and 38°to 41° S.4 
 
 
2.   Historic Catch and Level of Effort 
 
 
The U.S. troll fleet for South Pacific albacore flourished from about 1987 
through 2000.   The fleet declined in the last several years, primarily because of 
higher insurance and fuel costs, and the reduction of cannery demand for troll 
caught fish in American Samoa, until recently.   In addition some of the carrier 
vessels used by the fleet to transship to American Samoa have been taken out of 
service.   During that time the canneries in American Samoa came to depend on 
foreign longline fleets for their source of albacore.   As can be seen from the chart 
below, this fishery developed by the U.S. was once a 5,000 mt fishery employing 
over 50 vessels.

and fresh frozen troll caught albacore all suggest that this U.S. developed South 
Pacific albacore fishery can be very important to the U.S. in the future. 
 
 
3.   No Scientific Evidence That The Troll Fishery Has Impact On The Stock 
 
 
Scientific papers from the SPC and the WCPFC-SC have repeatedly 
testified to the health of the South Pacific albacore stock.   See WCPFC9-2012-IP. 
 
 
4.   AFRF Closing Statement From WCPFC-9 
 
 
It might be appropriate to repeat part of the AFRF Closing Statement  in 
December of 2012. 
 
 
As we have repeatedly indicated during informal discussions at these 
WCPFC meetings, the US albacore troll fleet is very concerned, as is 
TE Vaka Moana and the FFA about the large increase in longline 
effort. 
 
 
Longline catches of South Pacific albacore have risen dramatically in 
recent years and we, as others, are disappointed that the Commission 
has not agreed upon conservation and management measures to 
protect this important resource. 
 
 
Nevertheless it is prudent to repeat, as the most recent scientific 
studies before this Commission have proven, there is no scientific 
evidence, (nor was there when 2005-03 was accepted by the 
Commission), that the South Pacific albacore troll fishery   has had, 
or is having,   any adverse impact on the stocks.   Nor has the effort 
in that fishery increased.   The SPC, the SC, and the IATTC have all 
concluding that the South Pacific albacore stocks are above MSY. 
With no scientific basis to limit the effect of the U.S. troll fishery, the 
Commission should not agree to amending CMM 2005-03 or its 
replacement, CCM 2010-5 in any way that would inhibit the high seas 
U.S. troll fleet. 
 
 
It should also be remembered that as long ago as 2005, and carried 
through to the current CCM on South Pacific albacore, the 
Commission is required   to annually review the measure based on
Page 6 of   6 
 
sound scientific advice.7        We look forward to working with our 
South Pacific friend and neighbors in crafting a scientifically based 
and effectively enforced measure to be approved at WCPFC-10. 
 
 
5.   Current AFRF and AAFA Position 
 
 
The position of the U.S. South Pacific albacore troll harvesters remains 
firm.   There is no scientific or economic basis to close the high seas to the South 
Pacific albacore troll fishery.   This fishery occurs entirely outside of any of the 
Pacific Island Countries’ EEZs.
