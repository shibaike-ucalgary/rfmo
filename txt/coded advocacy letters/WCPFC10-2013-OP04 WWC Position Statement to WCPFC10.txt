10th Regular Session of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries
Commission (WCPFC): Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia –
December 2-6, 2013
Introduction and Summary
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) would like to thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries
Commission (WCPFC) for the opportunity to attend the 10th Regular Session as an observer and to address the
critically important role that it plays in the proper management of the (Western Central Pacific Ocean) WCPO
fisheries. The regulatory measures proposed and implemented by the WCPFC represent one of the legs of the
three-legged stool of successful sustainable and responsible fisheries management, the other legs consisting of the
science provided by the Scientific Committee (SC) and the compliance measures provided by the Technical and
Compliance Committee (TCC).  Without firm support on each one of those three components, the stool falls over
and fisheries management fails.
WWF once again calls on members of the WCPFC to address the issues and recommendations raised at SC9,
TCC9,  and  WCPFC9  as  well  as  observe  the  experience  of  other  RFMOs  in  their  own  efforts  to  achieve  and
maintain improved measures for monitoring and surveillance.  WWF wishes to reiterate its position offered in
Manila in December 2012 (WCPFC9) and, taking into account the WCPFC-related meetings held since, the
recommendations listed in bullets below.  For more detail and background on each position, please reference the
associated Appendix for this document.
Reference Points, Harvest Control Rules, and Harvest Strategies
WWF recommends that the WCPFC:
�
Designate of Limit and Target Reference Points as a priority for proper management of
stocks under WCPFC authority;
�
Establish precautionary B-based Limit Reference Points  (preferably based on Spawning
Biomass)  for all WCPO fish stocks under its authority;
�
Adopt supplementary and precautionary F-based Limit Reference Points to attempt to
control the exploitation rate for all WCPO fish stocks under its authority;
�
Implement/adopt interim precautionary Target Reference Points as a benchmark for
further consideration by the MOW and WCPFC in 2013; and
�
Ensure the probability of breaching the Limit Reference Points and limiting this to a risk
level of 10% or less as a precautionary measure.

A commitment to continuous improvement of the CDS by investigating the benefits
and  feasibility  of  verification  systems  such  as  electronic  tagging  and  the  use  of
biotechnology;
o
Establishment  of  a  capacity  development  fund  to  provide  a  cost-sharing
mechanism that enables progressive cost sharing among member states; and
o
Maximizing retailer and public access to data through modern electronic tools.
Conclusion
WWF  once  again  calls  on  the  WCPFC  to  look  carefully  look  at  our  collective  conduct  as  nations  with  a
responsibility for managing fishery resources in the WCPFC CA.  With respect to each of the agenda items
addressed at the WCPFC10 Regular Meeting, the commission delegates must genuinely consider whether
previous actions have been responsible and commendable in achieving the overarching goal of fisheries
sustainability in the WCPO.

WWF POSITION
The WCPFC shares the distinction as the youngest RFMO, but is also regarded as arguably the most effective.
However, we all must constantly guard against the complacency and greed that leads to poor decision-making
resulting in the collapsing fish stocks in other regions.  Unfortunately, with some stocks in the WCPO, such as
bigeye tuna, oceanic whitetip sharks, and silky sharks, we are treading dangerously down a path leading to
trouble.
The WCPFC possesses the ability and opportunity to chart the course towards sustainable fishery resources,
especially tuna, in the WCPO.  The WCPFC and its subsidiary bodies must continually promote and adopt strong
and effective conservation and management action to maintain and rebuild tuna stocks, implement appropriate
monitoring and enforcement measures, promote a viable tuna industry, and support vibrant coastal communities
throughout the South Pacific.

Appendix: WWF Position Discussion
10th Regular Session of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries
Commission (WCPFC): Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia –
December 2-6, 2013
Reference Points, Harvest Control Rules, and Harvest Strategies
WWF  remains  supportive  of  the  work  of  the  WCPFC  and  subsidiary  bodies  in  pursuing  the
implementation of Reference Points (RP), Harvest Control Rules (HCR), and Harvest Strategies (HS).
WWF  encourages  WCPFC10  to  endorse  and  support  the  adoption  of  explicit  Limit  and  Target
Reference Points (LRP/TRP) for all WCPO fishery stocks under WCPFC authority developed through
the subsidiary bodies as well as the Management Objectives Workshop.
Reference points provide management decision-makers an objective tool to determine whether a fish
stock  size  is  becoming  too  small  or  fishing  pressure  is  becoming  too  great.   WWF  notes  that  the
WCPFC has discussed and considered RP’s since 2006 and that, while the SC and TCC have made
several recommendations to the WCPFC on appropriate RP’s, the WCPFC has failed to adopt formal
explicit RP’s.  Furthermore, while stock assessments conducted by SPC use BMSY and FMSY as implicit
LRP’s and provide advice to the WCPFC, these proxies do not represent limits consistent with the
recommendations of the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA) and more refined RP’s are
justified based on the available scientific information.1
The  WCPFC  must  implement  RP’s  and  HCR’s  as  a  priority  for  the  sustainable  management  of  the
fishery resources in the WCPO.  Existing science supports the implementation of well-defined and
precautionary biologically-based LRP’s and WWF generally supports the previous recommendations
of the SC.  Therefore, WWF supports the recommendations of SC8 and SC9 that LRPs for bigeye tuna
(BET), yellowfin tuna (YFT) and South Pacific albacore (ALB) be set at Level 2 with regard to the
biomass-based LRP of 20%SBrecent,F=0, with the application of a sufficiently precautionary value of X%
in the Level 2 fishing mortality-based LRP of Fx%SPR.2  Furthermore, WWF suggests that the WCPFC
should  acknowledge  that  LRPs  are  predominantly  scientific  in  nature  and  may  be  set  completely
independently of and without relationship to TRPs.
At  the  SC9  meeting  in  Pohnpei,  most  Members,  Cooperating  Non-members,  and  Participating
Territories (CCMs) reiterated a preference for establishing biomass (B-based) LRPs.  While the
assumptions, uncertainties, and substantial amounts of information associated with biomass (B-
based) LRPs make them a less attractive option to some stakeholders, they constitute a critical tool to
ensure that stock sustainability is maintained.  F-based LRP’s are important and useful, but not as
critical as a B-based limit because a B-based limit ensures a biological floor that the fishery cannot go

WWF POSITION
below.  Reference points that specify a minimum biomass level for the stock, below which the fishery
is curtailed or, in the extreme case, closed, have the advantages that:
1.
Biomass is more directly linked to recruitment than is the fishing mortality rate;
2. Minimum biomass levels provide a guide for management of stocks that are already depleted
by setting a standard for rebuilding; and
3. During periods of adverse environmental conditions, a minimum biomass level provides a
seed stock for eventual recovery when conditions are more favourable.
In 2012, WCPFC9 requested the SC9 develop appropriate time-windows for analyzing and calculating
unfished biomass levels.  WWF supports the recommendation of SC9 that the time-window to be used
in the LRP 20%SBF=0, t1-t2 satisfies the following criteria:
1.
have a length of 10 years,
2. be based on the years t1=ylast-10 to t2=ylast-1 where ylast is the last year used in the assessment,
and
3. the approach used for calculating the unfished biomass levels be based on scaled estimates of
recruitment according to the stock recruitment relationship.
WWF generally supports the implementation of any Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE)
measures that serve to improve the understanding of the impacts of particular management measures.
Thus,  consistent  with  SC9  advice,  WWF  endorses  the  recommendation  that  this  time-window  be
subject to periodic review to ensure this approach is appropriately representing future conditions for
the individual stocks.
While WWF continues to hold that the establishment of B-based limits are more important because
they ensure a biological floor that the fishery cannot go below, we nonetheless believe that F-based
LRPs also represent useful tools to control fishing capacity or, in other words, the rate at which the
harvest  influences  the  stock  size.   WWF  supports  some  CCMs  recommendation  of  the  ‘matching’
approach to determining F-based limit reference points that are equivalent to the spawning biomass
limit reference points.  Consequently, WWF supports the recommendation of SC9 that the
identification  of  the  appropriate  values  of  X  for  each  species  in  the  LRP  FX%SPR0 be  based  on  an
iterative search to ‘match’ the FX%SPR0 with 20%SBF=0, t1-t2 as described by SPC.
This methodology, in part, relies on the ability of managers to identify what level of acceptable risk
should be applied to breaching a LRP.  WWF recommends that an acceptable precautionary risk level
of exceeding a LRP is represented by a value of 10% or less.  Once this level of risk has been identified,
WWF supports the SC9 recommendation that the appropriate values of X for each species in the LRP
FX%SPR0 be calculated using updated assessments.
WWF acknowledges the complexity of establishing TRPs, given the multiple factors that go into their
consideration.  However, while TRP’s require additional consideration of socio-economic
considerations, current understanding of the biological and socio-economic conditions does not
prevent the implementation of sufficiently precautionary interim TRP at this time.  WWF encourages
the WCPFC to consider and recommend a precautionary interim TRP.  The interim TRP would serve
as an advisory benchmark under which a more refined TRP could be established. Most significantly,
all the necessary information to implement such a benchmark TRP currently exists.
Lastly, WWF supports the SC9 recommendation that the WCPFC consider associated early warning or
‘trigger’ reference points (TrRP) which would alert the WCPFC that a stock could be approaching a
LRP and that appropriate management action may be required.
WWF continues to strongly urge the WCPFC and subsidiary bodies to formally endorse and adopt
LRP, TRP, and TrRPs. The adoption of explicitly determined LRP and TRP for at least the four key
tuna  species,  namely  SKJ,  ALB,  YFT,  and  BET,  must  be  considered  an  absolute  priority  for  the
sustainable management of these important resources in the WCPO.
WWF recommends that the WCPFC:

Tropical Tunas
In December 2012, WCPFC9 adopted CMM 2012-01 in an attempt to address continuing conservation
challenges involving bigeye tuna (BET).7  The WCP–CA bigeye catch for 2012 (161,679 mt) represents
the highest since 2004.  The high bigeye catch in 2012 coincides with the second highest number of
associated sets, albeit a 15-20% reduction on the record high in 2011. Furthermore, the number of
purse seine vessels in the tropical fishery reached an all-time high (294 vessels) and effort (both in
terms  of  days  fishing  and  number  of  sets)  was  the  second  highest.  Even  the  most  optimistic
interpretation of these results may be characterised by the word “failure.”  Therefore, a significant
reduction in fishing mortality on BET remains elusive and requires additional measures to reduce the
fishing mortality on BET.
While WWF maintains that the policy choices made by WCPFC9 fail to achieve meaningful
conservation of BET, we believe that there could be substantial improvements to the understanding of
the impact of Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) if the SC recommends the aggressive pursuit of
improved monitoring, surveillance, and general research involving FADs.  While there are ongoing
efforts within the SPC and PNA to pursue greater understanding of FAD dynamics, we believe that the
WCPFC should impose measures in support of FAD research aided by monitoring and surveillance
mechanisms  which  could,  for  instance,  improve  the  understanding  of  the  impacts  on  species
composition resulting from:
�
FAD type/size
�
Geographic location
�
Drift patterns and prevailing currents
�
Ocean depth and depth of FAD materials
�
Proximity to benthic relief/hydrogeographic features
While WWF supports precautionary measures to protect vulnerable stocks like BET, WWF also
believes  that  a  better  understanding  of  FAD  dynamics  would  help  inform  the  “additional  and
alternative targeted measures” that the FFA seeks to implement.
Lastly,  WWF  strongly  supports  the  efforts  of  the  SPC  to  analyse  the  impacts  of  different  levels  of
reductions  in  the  various  fishing  sectors.   WWF  encourages  all  CCMs  to  carefully  review  the
information and analysis provided by the SPC, particularly that contained in Tables 2 and 3 of MI-
WP-01,8 as they engage in an open and transparent deliberative process to determine where
reductions in BET catch must be made.  The WCPFC absolutely must make effective and enforceable
reductions  of  the  catch  in  all  sectors  to  achieve  a  meaningful  conservation  impact  for  BET.   Most
importantly, whatever measures the WCPFC selects absolutely must be subject to strong monitoring,
control, and surveillance measures
WWF recommends that the WCPFC:

Establish and support further research and monitoring of FADs.

�
Engage in an open and transparent deliberative process based on the best
available scientific information to determine the level of reductions in BET catch
necessary to achieve meaningful BET conservation.

mortality.
Pacifc Bluefin Tuna
This year the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific
Ocean (ISC) reported that the stock of North Pacific Bluefin is in extremely poor condition.  The ISC
confirmed that overfishing is occurring, the stock is heavily overfished, and its spawning stock
biomass has declined by as much as 96%.
WWF maintains strong concerns on rebuilding this ecologically, sociologically, and economically
important fishery resource.  The WCPFC must recommend that fishing mortality on Pacific bluefin be
urgently reduced, especially on juveniles, in order to reduce the risk of recruitment collapse and allow
spawning stock to rebuild. If sufficient management measures are not adopted, fishing should not be
allowed to continue on such a depleted stock.
WWF recommends that the WCPFC:
�
Adopt a long-term Pacific bluefin recovery plan, candidate limit and target
reference points, and harvest control rules that are well-defined, pre-agreed and
contain mandatory actions for a determined course of management action in
response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference
points.
�
Remove all exemptions under the current CMM for Pacific Bluefin tuna through
a revised CMM-2012-06.
Sharks
Many  shark  species  in  the  WCPO,  including  blue  sharks,  remain  subject  to  high  levels  of  fishing
mortality that current stock assessment trends suggest could be unsustainable.9  Sharks play a critical
role in the WCPO marine ecosystem as apex predators and indicators of ecosystem health.10  WWF is
concerned with shark conservation and sustainability in the WCPFC region as a whole and considers
responsible management, trade, and consumption where shark mortality occurs in all fishing
activities,  not  just  in  circumstances  where  tuna  fishing  is  occurring.   Therefore,  WCPFC  must  also
recognise the needs of coastal States in the WCPFC region to manage their shark populations.
WWF  recommends  the  WCPFC  impose  additional  measures  proposed  during  SC9  to  ensure  that
sharks generally are not being adversely impacted in the region, but also ensuring that some key shark
species are not being substantially depleted.  Therefore, we encourage the WCPFC to recommend
precautionary measures to reduce fishing mortality consistent with recommendations made at SC9
drawn from the discussion regarding a proposed integrated shark CMM.11  By way of reference, we
endorse the recommendations contained in sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the paper presented by Dr. Shelley
Clarke at SC9 and TCC9 in addition to measures recommended below.12
WWF recommends the WCPFC:
�
Develop, endorse, and adopt a Comprehensive Shark CMM that includes efforts
to:
o Mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the
Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management
Measures (CMMs) for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs ;
o Implement the recommendations for Bycatch that were endorsed at Kobe
III and adopt an annually updated report card system against these
recommendations for all of the WCPFC fisheries;

Convention.¶
Silky Sharks
At SC8 in Busan, Korea, the Scientific Services Provider offered strong scientific evidence that silky
sharks are currently overfished and subject to overfishing.14  Based on a previous SC recommendation,
the WCPFC subsequently executed efforts to rebuild spawning biomass of oceanic whitetip sharks by
adopting  CMM  2011-04.   However,  SC8  recommended  additional  analysis  for  silky  sharks  due  to
concerns over data conflict and potential biases in the stock assessment despite basic fishery
indicators  indicating  substantial  declines  in  recent  years.   An  updated  assessment  of  silky  sharks
presented to the SC9 strongly confirmed the previous conclusion that overfishing is occurring and
the  stock  is overfished.15  Thus, the current science strongly suggests that additional mitigation
measures to avoid capture and mortality of silky sharks is warranted.16  The  WCPFC  must  take
supplementary measures to specifically address the continued adverse impacts on silky sharks in
addition to general call for improvements in shark management overall.
With respect to silky sharks WWF recommends the WCPFC:
�
Impose additional mitigation measures and maintain existing measures in an
effort to improve the status of the WCPO silky shark stock including:
o mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the
Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management
Measures (CMMs) for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs;
o prohibit the retention, transhipment, storage, on-board sale, and landing
of silky sharks in all fisheries managed by the WCPFC;
o mandate the prompt and careful release of any captured silky sharks; and
o require, through data collected from observer programs and other means,
estimation of the number of releases of silky sharks, including the status
upon release (dead or alive), and reporting of this information to the
WCPFC.

Regional Observer Program
Information collected as part of an appropriate observer programme is critically important to the
proper management of a fishery.  Data collected by observers plays a central role in informing
fisheries scientists on everything ranging from stock assessments to non-target species impacts.
Furthermore,  observers  play  an  indispensable  role  in  monitoring  and  enforcing  very  important
conservation and management measures in the WCPO.  Indeed, observers represent the vanguard of
fisheries management through the science and service that they provide.  Consequently, observer
coverage  must  be  considered  a  top  priority  and  greater  support  must  be  provided  to  the  relevant
authority to see that the capacity of the ROP is strengthened.
The WCPFC must ensure, through appropriate guidance, that national observer programmes
administered under the ROP are fully resourced in terms of human and financial capital as well as
governed under appropriate administrative and management structures.  Within that consideration,
the WCPFC should endorse an analysis that considers and presents not only a cost-benefit analysis of
the observer programme in the context of proper management, but also different funding models that
CCMs could consider for ensuring proper administration and management of the observer program at
a national level.  In any event, more attention must be given to the development and full funding of
minimum standards that ensure a national programme can perform to ROP standards, including such
efforts as annual reviews of the national programs under pre-agreed performance standards.
Additionally, WWF continues to maintain significant concerns regarding the independence of
onboard observers from the perspective of data integrity.  The independence and the security of the
observer must be paramount to ensure data integrity.  Therefore, WWF recommends that any
observer funding model considered must avoid even the perception of conflict of interest.  This means
establishing a 3rd party payment system that insulates the observer from direct payment by the vessel
owner or operator, which constitutes an unequivocal financial conflict of interest.  Specifically, WWF
believes  that  a  “Pre-payment  Model”  that  would  require  funding  observer  placement  through  an
independent 3rd party agent (like an escrow account) could potentially provide the necessary
insulation from undue influence by the vessel owner or operator while also ensuring that the observer
is  properly  paid  and  transported  to  their  home  of  record  at  the  conclusion  of  their  service.   Thus,
WWF recommends that the WCPFC research funding models that ensure that observer providers can
provide timely and secure payments to observers without having those payments made directly to the
observer by the vessel owner or operator.
WWF generally supports current efforts throughout the WCPO in pursuit of Electronic Monitoring
(EM).   Other  fisheries  around  the  world  have  demonstrated  varying  levels  of  success  using  EM  in
limited circumstances, depending on the goal of the observation and data collection program.
Therefore,  each  application  of  EM  is  contextual  and  must  be  subject  to  thorough  analysis,
comprehensive testing, and careful monitoring to ensure the technology and program is functioning
as designed. WWF would like to acknowledge the important role that EM could potentially play in
ensuring observer coverage throughout the WCPFC CA, possibly even at a reduced cost, but noting
that there will always be a need for human observers to perform certain analytical tasks that a camera,
sensor, or computer simply cannot accomplish.  WWF recommends that the WCPFC establish a peer
review process for the various EM programs in progress or currently planned for implementation in
the WCPO.
Lastly, WWF acknowledges and supports the establishment of the Regional Observer Programme
Independent  Working  Group  (ROPIWG)  and  the  continued  work  toward  improving  the  ROP,
including  consideration  of  observer  health,  safety,  and  welfare  as  well  as  technical  data  collection
issues.
With respect to the ROP, WWF recommends the WCPFC:
�
Further implementation of a binding, consistent, and consolidated set of
standards for the ROP;
�
Develop an analysis of the observer programme in the context of proper
management, including an analysis of different funding models;

WWF  maintains  that  an  efficient  and  comprehensive  catch  documentation  scheme  (CDS)  is  a
necessary part of a well-managed fishery.  Good catch documentation is essential to proper fisheries
management, providing the data necessary for analyses as basic as stock assessments to the product
traceability that seafood markets are increasingly demanding.  WWF supports the development and
implementation of a comprehensive CDS and supports the establishment of the Catch Documentation
Scheme Working Group (CDSWG) and their efforts toward improving catch documentation and
traceability in the WCPFC-managed fisheries.
WWF recommends that any CDS considered by the WCPFC must be fully comprehensive to be
effective,  including  documentation  of  all  catches,  landings,  transfers,  and  trade.   Other  RFMOs
provide relevant examples of CDS schemes that were not robust enough to provide adequate
documentation.   For  instance,  the  Commission  for  the  Conservation  of  Southern  Bluefin  Tuna
(CCSBT) switched from a purely trade-based scheme to a more comprehensive CDS because the initial
program allowed for substantial overharvest by one of its members resulting from the trade-based
scheme  not  being  inclusive  of  all  catches,  landings  and  trade.   Thus,  any  CDS  considered  by  the
WCPFC must include all catches, landings, transfers, or trade as part of the framework for the
schemes, not just the trade-based information.
With respect to the development of a comprehensive CDS, WWF recommends the
WCPFC:
�
Consider the following elements of a robust CDS system, including:
o A requirement for documentation to accompany all catch harvested,
landed, transhipped, traded domestically, exported, processed, imported
and re-exported and which relies on electronic documentation.
o Complementary measures to maximize the effectiveness of the CDS
through:
� ensuring  that  transhipment  at  sea  does  not  compromise  the
effectiveness of the CDS;
� adopting Port State Measures implemented simultaneously with the
CDS; and
� adopting trade restriction measures against flag States with vessels
on the IUU list.
o Parameters that include all species of tunas, billfish, and sharks managed
by the WCPFC;
�
Consider 
additional elements 
to support the integrity, 
reliability 
and
sustainability of a CDS system, including:
o A commitment to continuous improvement of the CDS by investigating the
benefits and feasibility of verification systems such as electronic tagging
and the use of biotechnology;
o Establishment of a capacity development fund to provide a cost-sharing
mechanism that enables progressive cost sharing among member states;
and
o Maximizing retailer and public access to data through modern electronic
tools.
