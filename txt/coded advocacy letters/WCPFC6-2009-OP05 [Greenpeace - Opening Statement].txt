Mr Chairman, delegates and participants 
Greenpeace welcomes the incoming chair Ambassador Satya Nandan and also wish to express our 
gratitude to the leaving of The Executive Director, Mr. Andrew Wright and MCS Manager Mr. Andrew 
Richards.  
This 6th Commission meeting is a critical meeting, since tuna is increasingly seen around the world as 
under threat giving this meeting the opportunity to set things right and will not be the next causality of 
rampant global overfishing.   
The future of the Pacific and its people will be in the hands of the decisions you make this week.  
Greenpeace would like to commend the leadership and strive by Pacific Island countries that are members 
of the Commission in securing the future of this fishery. In particular The Parties to the Nauru Agreement 
(PNA) for taking the bold and positive step by agreeing to the implementation of the 3rd Implementing 
Agreement from 1st January 2010 and we urge this Commission to adopt compatible measures.  
The world’s markets are beginning to reject unsustainable tuna, following the debacle of bluefin tuna 
under ICCAT’s mismanagement. Greenpeace has been working to unveil the shadowy networks of 
international tuna trade and corporate power holders in the multibillion-dollar fishing industry. The failure 
by RFMOs and the continuing increase catches against science advice will be brought to the public 
spotlight.    
Greenpeace eight-week voyage into the Pacific high seas pockets this year again proved the vulnerability 
of the high seas pockets to IUU fishing in particular by longline fleets. During the expedition we found 
illegal transshipments by long-liners that transshipped without the authorization of the licensing coastal 
2 
 
state. We also documented longline vessel fishing in the high seas and illegally in the EEZ of a PIC. It is 
highly likely many unreported activities are taking place in these areas.   
The expedition was also during the FAD ban period allowing us to show that the two-month ban of FADs 
is inadequate and we spotted ten devices in the two major high seas pockets. We also documented a 
fishing support vessel tending a FAD during the close period and vessel fishing on FAD utilising its 
exemption that was granted by the Commission.   
The WCPFC scientific advice now recommends fishing effort for bigeye tuna to be reduced by 34-50% to 
return stocks to sustainability. This is welcomed and should be urgently adopted for implementation by 
the Commission. 
Greenpeace proposes that WCPFC6 agreed to:  
� A 50% reduction in tuna fishing effort across the entire WCPO fisheries, based on the average 
2001-2004 levels.  This will be in line with Scientific Committee recommendation in particular 
to the bigeye stock but is required by the precautionary approach to account for the high levels 
of unknown and uncertainties in fishing data. 
� The closure of the 4 high seas pockets to all fishing and removal of fishing effort that occurs in 
these areas.  
� A ban on all at-sea transhipments with no exemptions granted to any vessel. CCMs should also 
adopt compatible measures as outlined under article 8 of the Convention and prohibit all in 
zone at-sea transhipments. 
� A permanently ban on the use of FADs in association with purse seine fishing in order to 
protect juvenile tuna and other marine life..
