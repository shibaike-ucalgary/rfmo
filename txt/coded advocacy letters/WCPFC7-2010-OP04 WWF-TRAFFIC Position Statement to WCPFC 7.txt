WWF – TRAFFIC STATEMENT TO WCPFC – 7 Regular Session 
Honolulu, Hawaii, 6 – 10 December 2010 
 
Introduction 
 
Recognizing that the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC)is now in its 
seventh year of existence, WWF and TRAFFIC believe that the time for significant action is 
urgently overdue in collectively agreeing to and implementing conservation and management 
measures for the sustainable exploitation of the Pacific’s tuna resources and associated bycatch.  
 
WWF and TRAFFIC recognize and applaud the significant efforts that the Parties to the Nauru 
Agreement (PNA) have instigated with regard to management reform within their respective 
Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ’s). WWF and TRAFFIC support many of these initiatives that 
begin the journey toward sustainable tuna resources within the region. However, the concern 
over the decline in bigeye tuna in particular is not yet fully reflected in the management 
decisions that have been taken or translated into fishing behavior that can be considered 
responsible or sustainable for this species. The WCPFC will be judged as to its competency on 
the basic facts of whether it has enacted in a timely manner, meaningful management measures 
that contain fishing effort within sustainable limits. While some believe seven years is a short 
time for a management regime to show achievement we believe the honeymoon is over, the 
WCPFC needs to show measurable achievements and the performance review needs to be 
prioritized to help guide positive action for the future.   
 
WWF and TRAFFIC consider that the WCPFC needs to improve its performance to ensure the 
sustainable management of tuna stocks within its mandate. This means adopting truly 
precautionary conservation measures that are based on precautionary limit and target 
reference points for tuna stocks. Furthermore the WCPFC needs to adopt comprehensive and 
consistent best practices to mitigate bycatch associated with tuna fishing and as a basic 
requirement not allow for the setting of purse seine nets associated with marine mammals or 
whale or basking sharks. There are a number of underlying issues that WCPFC needs to address 
in order to strengthen the platform for effective management of both bycatch and target 
species, including: 
 
� Mandating the submission of bycatch data by members and co-operating non-members. 
In the absence of reliable data, and hence in an environment of uncertainty about the 
 
 
2 
nature  and  extent  of  the  bycatch  problem,  a  more  precautionary  approach  to  
management is required. 
 
� Developing science based observer programmes with clearly specified objectives that: 
o validate data submitted; 
o are designed to provide statistically robust estimates of the extent of bycatch by 
species across the temporal and spatial distribution of the fleet; and 
o allow for observers to play a role in monitoring the implementation of bycatch 
mitigation measures. 
� Adopting ecological risk assessment as a means to ensure that available scientific and 
management resources are targeted to the most vulnerable species.  
� Implementing effective means of monitoring compliance with all aspects of Conservation 
and Management Measures (CMMs) by individual members.  
� Introducing a system of stringent penalties for failure to comply with those CMMs, in 
particular, failure to comply with data submission (bycatch and target species) 
requirements.  
 
Bigeye and Yellowfin tuna 
The purse seine fishery catch of bigeye (BET) and yellowfin (YFT) tuna is comprised mainly of 
juveniles of these species, well below both the size of first reproduction and that which would 
maximize yield per recruit. As a result, the impacts of associated purse seine sets on BET and 
YFT are out of proportion with catches (Molony, 2007). Associated purse seine sets are 
estimated to have been responsible for reducing the total biomass of BET by more than 20% 
and of YFT by more than 10% (Molony 2007). Harley et al. (2010) conclude that the purse seine 
and other surface fisheries have an equal or greater impact on the BET biomass than longline 
fisheries and that the purse seine and Philippines/Indonesian domestic fisheries also have a 
substantial impact on region 3 and to a lesser extent region 4.  
The WCPFC has recognized that a reduction in the purse seine catch of juvenile BET and YFT is 
required to reduce the impact of the fishery on these stocks.  This is reflected in CMM 2008-01, 
but its effectiveness is questionable at best. 
In addition to the WCPFC measures, PNA members recognized in 2009 the “serious impact on 
the bigeye stock from fishing by distant water longliners and purse seiners in the high seas and 
that the high seas continue to provide a safe haven for IUU fishing”. The PNA Group 
subsequently adopted the Koror Declaration in February 2010, which, expressing concern about 
the status of BET and YFT and the increasing growth of capacity and effort in the region, closed 
those additional high seas areas (PNA, 2010).

Bigeye tuna 
In 2010, the Scientific Committee of the WCPFC: 
� concluded that “overfishing is occurring in the bigeye stock but possibly at a lower level 
than previously estimated” and “approaching an overfished state, if it is not already 
slightly overfished”; 
� recent catches are well above the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) level, and the 
Committee concluded that current catch levels are unlikely to be sustainable in the 
longer term even the recent [high] levels of recruitment estimated for the last decade.    
� noted “the continued high fishing mortality on juvenile bigeye due to associated purse 
seine sets and the fisheries of Indonesia and the Philippines”; 
� recommended that a 29% reduction in fishing mortality from the average levels for 2005 
– 2008 (equivalent to a minimum 31% reduction in fishing mortality from the 2004 
levels) was required in order to return fishing mortality to MSY levels;  
� advised that the management measures for bigeye tuna established in 2008 (for both 
the purse seine and longline fleets) will not achieve the targeted reduction in fishing 
mortality.   
 
WWF and TRAFFIC believe that the effort reduction measures in place under the Vessel Day 
Scheme (VDS), and reflected in CMM 2008-01 are inadequate and that much greater reductions 
in vessel days are required in order to place BET on the path to sustainability. Further, should 
fishing effort from the closed high seas areas be transferred to archipelagic waters which are 
excluded from the CMM, and further East, additional pressure may be placed on BET.  WWF and 
TRAFFIC consider that the BET stock is not within biologically based limits and the management 
measures in place are considered unlikely to ensure recovery or rebuilding of the stock. 
 
Yellowfin tuna 
No new information on the stock status of YFT was presented to Scientific Committee 6 (SC6) 
and therefore the Committee recommended that the management recommendations from the 
previous (SC5) be maintained. In 2009 the Scientific Committee: 
� advised that the YFT stock is not overfished and that overfishing is not occurring; 
� recommended that there be no increase in fishing mortality of YFT in the western 
equatorial region.   
 
WWF and TRAFFIC support the Scientific Committees recommendation to the Commission for 
BET in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) to reduce fishing mortality by a 
minimum of 29% from the average levels for 2005 – 2008.  
 
WWF and TRAFFIC support the Scientific Committees recommendation to the Commission for 
YFT in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) to limit YFT fishing mortality to its 2001-
2004 level.

Reference points 
The WCPFC has not adopted formal reference points for any tuna or tuna related species under 
its management within the Convention area.  
 
In 2009 a special workshop on reference points was held by the WCPFC Scientific Committee’s 
Methods Specialist Working Group. WWF and TRAFFIC understand that it was expected that the 
Scientific Committee would make recommendations on appropriate provisional limit reference 
points for the key target species to the WCPFC in 2010. The Commission’s decisions on 
reference points will also take into account the outcomes of the Workshop on Management 
Objectives to be held in 2010. WWF and TRAFFIC notes, however, that reference points have 
been under consideration in the WCPFC since 2006 and it appears that this vital process has 
been delayed yet again for another year. While it is now expected that the Scientific Committee 
may make recommendations to the Commission in 2011 on appropriate reference points, there 
can be no certainty that this will not be delayed again or the Commission will formally adopt 
them. As discussed above, the WCPFC has not adopted formal limit or target reference points.   
 
WWF and TRAFFIC strongly urge the WCPFC to formally adopt target reference points. WWF 
and TRAFFIC believe that the adoption of explicitly determined limit and target reference 
points  for  at  least  the  four  key  tuna  species  is  an  absolute  priority  for  the  sustainable  
management of the resource.  
 
Harvest strategy & Harvest control rules 
There are no explicit harvest control rules in the WCPFC.  Monitoring of the stocks is based on 
catch and effort data, length-frequency and tagging data. The current rudimentary harvest 
strategy employed in the WCPFC does not contain any harvest control rules and as such does 
not reflect best practice. The primary management action involves limiting fishing effort via an 
array of input controls such as the PNA’s VDS, closure of high seas pockets, FAD closures, and 
implementation of capacity limits (driven by concerns for BET and YFT).  
 
The Convention for the WCPFC includes default target and limit reference points and the 
management objective for all target stocks is to maintain stocks at or above MSY-based 
reference points. The absence of harvest control rules that provide for immediate and effective 
action to reduce exploitation rates, when and as required, is a serious concern.  
 
While the WCPFC could argue that it is capable of implementing management action in 
response to scientific advice on stock status (for example BET and YFT), the effectiveness of this 
action is questionable and this underlines the importance of well defined harvest control rules 
to ensure timely and adequate management.  
 
WWF and TRAFFIC call on the WCPFC to adopt harvest control rules that are well-defined, pre-
agreed and contain mandatory actions for an agreed and determined course of management 
action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points.

Proposed Participation Fee 
WWF and TRAFFIC appreciates the concerns expressed by some member countries regarding 
ever increasing costs and budget demands associated with tuna Regional Fisheries Management 
Organization (RFMO) meetings. However, the proposal to introduce a participation or 
registration fee of US$500 – 700 per delegate to cost recover observer attendance, particularly 
Non Government Organizations (NGOs) and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), at the 
Commission and its subsidiary meetings is iniquitous and misguided.  
 
NGOs and CSOs represent, not just their respective organizations, but the entire external 
general public, providing an insight and voice for the broader community who are also key 
stakeholders concerned with the sustainable management and utilization of tuna and related 
marine resources. For many, the people they represent rely upon the sustainability of these 
resources for their daily livelihoods. In this sense, NGOs and CSOs provide significant benefits 
for  governments,  industry,  and  scientists  in  terms  of  education  and  awareness  of  resource  
issues and thus are essential to build trust and confidence within the general community and 
amongst consumers. 
 
If such a fee were to be introduced, this would result in reduced and restricted participation by 
many NGOs and CSOs alike, and an immediate eroding effect on the Commissions’ current 
open, transparent and inclusive approach. This would absolutely undermine the trust and 
confidence that the general community and consumers have in their governments 
representatives ability to be responsible stewards of the tuna resources.  
 
WWF and TRAFFIC strongly oppose any fee being introduced for the participation of NGOs or 
CSOs at any meeting concerning this RFMO.   
 
Regional Observer Program (ROP) 
There is no current impediment for all support vessels to have 100% observer coverage such as 
that currently in place on purse seine vessels, while 100% observer coverage for longliners 
should be phased in. WWF and TRAFFIC suggests the following timetable for a 3-year phase-in 
of 100% ROP coverage for all fishing vessels: 
 
o 2011 All support vessels (resupply, refueling, reefers) for all high seas fishing have 100% 
ROP coverage; 
o 2011 20% of all longliners (including at least one from each flag state) have an ROP 
observer on board; 
o 2012 50% of all longliners (including more than half of all vessels from each flag state) 
have an ROP observer on board; 
o 2013 100% of all longliners have an ROP observer on board.  
 
WWF and TRAFFIC call for a comprehensive and strong Regional Observer Program with 100% 
coverage of all fishing vessels (including both catching and support vessels).

Catch Documentation Scheme 
WWF and TRAFFIC consider the failure to implement a catch documentation scheme (CDS) as a 
significant problem. It is time for the WCPFC to take urgent action to address overfishing and to 
support and enforce that action by introducing a CDS. WWF and TRAFFIC recognize that the 
introduction of a CDS will pose some challenges to the WCPFC given the nature of tuna fisheries. 
However, WCPFC needs to ensure that all fish stocks managed by this RFMO are subject to the 
CDS as a proactive precautionary measure. WWF and TRAFFIC recommend that the WCPFC 
must: 
 
1. Agree at its December 2010 meeting to adopt a CDS measure for at least the four1 key tuna 
species with a date of implementation starting from 1 July 2011; 
 
2. Implement a CDS that requires documentation to accompany all catch harvested, landed, 
transshipped, traded domestically, exported, processed, imported and re-exported and which 
relies on electronic documentation. The CDS should not exclude any catches, landings or trade 
as is common in schemes which are trade based rather than catch document schemes. One only 
has to look to the lessons learnt by the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin 
Tuna (CCSBT) which has switched from a trade based scheme to a CDS due to the trade scheme 
allowing for substantial over catches by one of its members as a result of the trade scheme not 
being inclusive of all catches, landings or trade; 
 
3. Ensure that complementary measures are in place to maximize the effectiveness of the CDS 
by: 
� ensuring that transshipment at sea does not compromise the effectiveness of the CDS; 
� adopting Port State measures (consistent with global agreement) to take effect at the 
same time as the tuna CDS; and 
� adopting measures that provide for trade-restrictions to be used against flag States with 
vessels on the IUU list. 
 
4. Acknowledge the need to implement CDS for other species of tunas, billfish and sharks 
managed by the Commission; 
 
5. Commit to continuous improvement of the CDS by investigating the benefits and feasibility of 
verification systems such as tagging and the use of biotechnology; 
 
6. Establish a capacity development fund to act as a cost-sharing mechanism to enable for cross 
subsidising across wealthy and less-wealthy members to ensure effective implementation and 
administration of the CDS; and 
 
7. Maximize retailer and public access to CDS data through modern online tools.

Bycatch Conservation Management Measures 
WWF and TRAFFIC believe that WCPFC must: 
� take immediate management action to avoid bycatch interactions and to mitigate the 
impact of those interactions; 
� task the relevant scientific/ecosystem body to improve bycatch related information and 
strengthen the long-term management about bycatch levels and mitigation options;  
� review and revise management actions on bycatch as information increases; and 
� take action to strengthen their capacity to manage and monitor compliance with 
conservation and management measures. 
 
The recent Kobe II Bycatch workshop held in Australia produced a number of key outcomes 
including: 
� highlighting the need for urgent action and the insufficiency of available information to 
dictate the need for and  underpin immediate management action; 
� emphasising that the tuna RFMOs must act to address bycatch across the five key 
taxonomic groups affected; 
�  failing to identify best practice bycatch management techniques but instead 
recommending a set of principles for developing best practice bycatch avoidance and 
mitigation measures; and 
� most significantly recommending the formation of a Joint Tuna RFMO Technical Working 
Group (TWG) on Bycatch. 
 
The Technical Working Group (TWG) provides a unique opportunity to bring together experts to 
share the latest available information and develop coherent, consistent and comprehensive 
measures to minimise and mitigate the impacts of tuna fisheries on bycatch species. However, 
there is no formal agreement to endorse and support the TWGs establishment and operation, 
nor a proposed time frame for its work to be completed within. Consequently, and being aware 
of the need to maintain the momentum on this initiative, a number of environmental NGOs 
(including WWF and TRAFFIC) have developed a Compendium best practice of Conservation and 
Management Measures (CMMs) for the bycatch species taxonomic groups. Four CMMs (please 
refer to ‘bycatch Conservation and Management Measures’ document) have been prepared, on 
the basis of the best available scientific advice and taking into account current practice within 
tuna RFMOs. The CMMs cover the following four taxonomic groups: 
 
� Seabirds 
� Sharks 
� Sea turtles 
� Marine mammals 
 
WCPFC must take responsibility for species bycatch and act immediately. This Compendium 
provides WCPFC with advice on the best practice, precautionary measures that must be 
implemented on an interim basis pending the advice of the TWG. These actions can be reviewed 
and revised to reflect that advice when it becomes available.  
 
 
8 
 
WWF and TRAFFIC are calling for these CMMs to enter into force by 1 January in the year 
following adoption of the CMMs. Further, we call for the endorsement, and urgent 
establishment of the Joint Tuna RFMO Technical Working Group on Bycatch by the tuna 
RFMOs. These actions are required to demonstrate the commitment of the WCPFC to 
addressing bycatch impacts associated with their fisheries.  
 
CONCLUSION 
WWF and TRAFFIC call on the Commission to take the hard decisions now to prevent future 
fisheries collapse. Scientists have been calling for large reductions in BET catch for over a 
decade. Past performance of the Commission is, at best; slow to respond to such advice. This 
wavering seriously jeopardises the commercial viability of the BET and YFT fishery in the WCPO 
into the future.  Effective management action must be adopted at this year’s Commission 
meeting. If the Commission doesn’t move fast to restore stocks and implement appropriate 
reference points and harvest strategies, including moving toward rights based management 
regime, it will directly impact the viability of the region’s tuna fisheries, and the economies of 
developing countries.
