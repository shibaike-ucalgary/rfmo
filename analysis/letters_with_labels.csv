WCPFC3-2006-OP02,6.0,With the exception of bait casters the mitigation measures listed are a good depiction of measures believed to reduce seabird bycatch in pelagic fisheries However caveats are associated with most measures This reiterates the point made at the WCPFC Ecosystem Bycatch meeting on the need to use combinations of measures All fisheries in which seabird bycatch mitigation has been successful have found that combinations of measures are essential As stated at the WCPFC Ecosystem Bycatch meeting the strength of the Column A and Column B approach is that it requires such combinations while also providing flexibility to select the combination most suited to their vessel,with the exception of bait caster the mitigation measure list be a good depiction of measure believe to reduce seabird bycatch in pelagic fishery however caveat be associate with most measure this reiterate the point make at the wcpfc ecosystem bycatch meeting on the need to use combination of measure all fishery in which seabird bycatch mitigation have be successful have find that combination of measure be essential as state at the wcpfc ecosystem bycatch meeting the strength of the column a and column b approach be that it require such combination while also provide flexibility to select the combination most suited to their vessel,Governance
WCPFC3-2006-OP02,7.0,Streamer lines night setting and weighted branch lines can be highly effective mitigation measures when used properly and in combination Sidesetting has been found effective in Hawaiian fisheries when combined with line weighting and a setting curtain However research is urgently needed to test the effectiveness of sidesetting in the Southern Ocean where deeperdiving seabird species are common Further testing is also recommended on the effectiveness of bluedyed squid in the Southern Ocean on the effectiveness of lineshooters and on best practises for offal management A plan for research developed across pelagic fishery RFMOs would provide the necessary tools to reduce seabird mortality in pelagic fisheries worldwide As noted at the 2006 WCPFC Scientific Committee meeting the recommendations on seabird mitigation measures should be considered as interim Measures will need to be reevaluated as more information becomes available through research,streamer line night set and weight branch line can be highly effective mitigation measure when use properly and in combination sidesetting have be find effective in hawaiian fishery when combine with line weighting and a set curtain however research be urgently need to test the effectiveness of sidesette in the southern ocean where deeperdive seabird specie be common further testing be also recommend on the effectiveness of bluedye squid in the southern ocean on the effectiveness of lineshooter and on good practise for offal management a plan for research develop across pelagic fishery rfmo would provide the necessary tool to reduce seabird mortality in pelagic fishery worldwide as note at the 2006 wcpfc scientific committee meet the recommendation on seabird mitigation measure should be consider as interim measure will need to be reevaluate as more information become available through research,Governance
WCPFC3-2006-OP02,8.0,Recommendation to the Third Meeting of the WCPFC A seabird Conservation Measure based on the recommendation from the WCPFC Scientific Committee would be a highly constructive step to reduce seabird bycatch in the WCPFC area The strength of the recommendation lies in its requirement for the use of two mitigation measures providing the necessary use of a combination of measures while also providing flexibility for fishermen to select the combination most suited to their vessel Table 1 Review of seabird bycatch mitigation measures listed in the seabird recommendation from the

WCPFC3-2006-OP03,3.0,INTRODUCTION Since the second annual meeting of the WCPFC in December 2005 there have been some significant developments in global fisheries conservation and management Primary among these was the United Nations Fish Stocks Review Conference in May 2006 at which a key issue of focus was the performance of the worlds 16 regional fisheries management organizations RFMOs The focus on RFMOs at the UNFSA Review Conference is part of ongoing international efforts to address the reasons for the widespread failure of RFMOs to prevent overfishing degradation of the marine ecosystems and suboptimal benefits accruing to coastal States fishing States and their legitimate fishing industries Multilateral bilateral and unilateral efforts are underway to identify the reasons for these failures and move rapidly to implement effective measures to address them Initiatives such as the Ministeriallyled High Sea Task Force on Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing which released its final report in March 2006 the MCS Network and the meeting of the five tuna RFMOs to be hosted by Japan early in 2007 represent some of these efforts As a contribution to international efforts at the UNFSA Review Conference WWF and TRAFFIC released the report Follow the Leader learning from experience and best practice in regional fisheries management organisations The WCPF Convention is arguably the most innovative and farreaching RFMO in force to date Given that it was negotiated postUNFSA the Convention reflects much of what is widely regarded as international best practice in areas such as recognition of the precautionary approach facilitating developing State participation explicit acknowledgement of allocation and evolved decisionmaking processes The responsibilities of the Commission can not be understated it is responsible not only for the conservation and management of the worlds largest tuna fishery supplying almost half of the global supply but also for the broader marine ecosystem upon which the longterm prosperity of this fishery relies In the context of the current and growing international focus on the performance of RFMOs there are high expectations from the international community that the WCPFC has the tools at its disposal to succeed where other RFMOs have failed To meet these expectations WWF and TRAFFIC consider the following to be priorities for action PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH Bigeye Tuna and Yellowfin Tuna management The Commissions decision at its 2005 meeting to limit catch and effort at record levels was contrary to the advice of its Scientific Committee and the precautionary approach The Scientific Committees advice to this meeting is similar to that in 2005 if not more pessimistic with regard to Bigeye Tuna The advice from the Scientific Committee is that a reduction in fishing mortality of 39 is required to maintain the Bigeye Tuna biomass at a level 20 above that which will produce maximum sustainable yield MSY Similarly a reduction in fishing mortality on Yellowfin Tuna is required to maintain biomass at a level 20 above the level at which MSY is produced In the context of the Scientific Committees advice WWF and TRAFFIC draw the Commissions attention to the fact that under the precautionary approach set out under UNFSA MSY is minimum standard for a limit reference point not a target reference point ie stocks should be maintained at levels above those that can produce MSY WWF and TRAFFIC draw the attention of the Commission to Conservation and Management Measure CMM 200501 concerning Bigeye and Yellowfin Tuna which provides for the catch and effort levels set under that CMM to be reviewed annually in light of the Scientific Committees advice WWF urges the Commission to follow the advice of SC2 and take action to reduce catch of Bigeye and Yellowfin at this meeting Additionally priority should be given to developing and adopting a robust Management Evaluation Strategy MSE prior to the expiration of the threeyear limit on longline catch levels for Bigeye Tuna established under CMM 200501 The MSE would then provide a decisionmaking framework within which the current catch and effort limits can be reassessed The Scientific Committee considered the development of a MSE to be the highest level of priority in its future work programme and we call on Members to provide the necessary extraordinary funding for this work to be urgently undertaken Action to address the ongoing overfishing of Bigeye Tuna and Yellowfin Tuna may pervert the flow of economic benefits from the longline and purse seine fisheries respectively in the short to medium term In this context we would draw the attention of Members to their unilateral and collective obligations under Article 5 of this Convention among others to apply the precautionary approach and prevent these stocks from moving to an overfished state Traderelated measures Traderelated measures for tuna species is not a new concept and much work has been done to assess the different forms that these measures can take and the effectiveness of various systems in meeting objectives TRAFFIC and WWF have undertaken a number of analyses of the effectiveness and deficiencies in traderelated measures adopted by RFMOs including most recently that of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna Given the global nature of trade in tuna products and the laundering of catches already known to occur it is inevitable that the Commission will need to consider some form of a traderelated measure for the WCPFC WWF and TRAFFIC believe that a priority for the Commission is to ensure that the objectives of its traderelated measure are clearly stated to provide a basis against which to the pros and cons of different schemes and to ensure that the deficiencies in the schemes of other RFMOs are not repeated More specifically proposals to implement a pareddown statistical documentation scheme SDS need to be carefully examined in the light of deficiencies already exposed in systems that deal only with the trade component rather than being inclusive of catch as well Given that the Commission has already signaled its intention to move rapidly to allocate fishing opportunities as well as existing concerns about levels of illegal unregulated and unreported IUU fishing in the Convention area WWF and TRAFFIC consider that the most cost and conservationeffective way forward is for the Commission to adopt a catch documentation scheme from the outset rather than subject the fishing industry and the membership to a series of iterative steps towards such a comprehensive scheme over a number of years Transhipment WWF and TRAFFIC are fully aware that accurate reporting of catches is essential in assessing the health of the fishery Transhipment requirements are articulated in Article 29 of the Convention and Annex III Article 4 Identifying designated ports for transhipment taking into account exceptional situations where this may not be possible will reduce and discourage IUU related activities With the understanding that the adoption of transshipment guidelines will be made at WCPFC4 as per the recommendation from the Technical and Compliance Committee TCC to the Commission we would like to encourage the Commission to move forward with its recommendation to develop transhipment guidelines prior to WCPFC4,introduction since the second annual meeting of the wcpfc in december 2005 there have be some significant development in global fishery conservation and management primary among these be the united nations fish stocks review conference in may 2006 at which a key issue of focus be the performance of the world 16 regional

WCPFC3-2006-OP03,5.0,ECOSYSTEM APPROACH TO FISHERIES MANAGEMENT WWF and TRAFFIC welcome the intersessional work done and congratulate the Scientific Committee and its subsidiary bodies There are a number of areas with respect to species of special interest and broader ecosystem considerations that we would like to highlight Species of special interest Turtles Populations of sea turtles are vulnerable to even smallscale adult mortality resulting from longline bycatch WWF and numerous partners are engaged in collaborative trials for longline bycatch mitigation in the eastern and western Pacific and have also encouraged through the Smartgear competition the development of innovative and adaptive fishing gears designed to reduce bycatch We are encouraged to see that many countries catching tuna in the Convention area are likewise testing alternative gear such as circle hooks WWF and TRAFFIC support the general recommendations for sea turtle data collection and research of the Scientific Committee in 2006 particularly the identification of those fishery sectors with a turtle bycatch problem as well as the recommendation for a flexible approach based on scientific research to sea turtle mitigation measures However this research must result in action in a timely manner As turtle bycatch hotspots are identified the Commission must require concrete mitigation action from CCMs such as widespread gear change seasonal closures in such hotspots rather than supporting an ongoing research programme Sharks WWF and TRAFFIC are encouraged by the recognition of the Commission of the vulnerability of shark species to the impacts of fishing and the need to implement measures to mitigate these impacts In this context TRAFFIC is close to completing an analysis of shark conservation measures adopted by other RFMOs and has identified both deficiencies and best practice arising from this analysis The analysis reiterates that the key to sustainable shark fisheries is to understand and manage the level of mortality incurred by fishing Effective management requires reliable species or stockspecific information on biology and total mortality landings and discards and precautionary limits in the face of uncertainty While all shark species are relatively more vulnerable to overfishing than most other marine fishes within the shark category the level of vulnerability varies considerably There is an urgent need to improve our understanding of shark mortality on a species basis and it is important therefore that information is collected on this basis and that riskbased management measures are adopted for individual species where necessary The approach adopted by a number of other RFMOs in response to these requirements has been to implement bans on shark finning However the extent to which finning bans will achieve shark conservation depends on how they are applied The key element of the bans is the requirement to land both the trunk and the fins and there are a number of ways in which this requirement can be applied from relying on a ratio of fintobody weight to requiring the landing of whole specimens Clearly a fintobody ratio provides the least contribution to data collection and creates difficulties for enforcement To maximise effectiveness with respect to these objectives and account for the practicalities of fishing WWF and TRAFFIC recommend that sharks should be landed headed and gutted with skins fins claspers dorsal spines where applicable attached This approach maximises product quality and makes a significant contribution to shark species identification quantification of weight of catch and enforcement It is also the approach recommended by FAO in its Technical Guidelines for Responsible Fisheries Further to provide a basis for effective shark conservation into the future the CMM needs to relate to all species of the Class Chondrichthyes Seabirds At its second annual session the Commission recognized the need to take urgent action with respect to mitigating incidental catch of seabirds and the need to cooperate with other organizations in this quest We welcome the comprehensive recommendations from the Scientific Committee and TCC with regard to mitigation measures to be adopted as well as future research and data needs We would urge the Commission to adopt and implement a CMM specific to seabird mitigation at this meeting consistent with the recommendations contained in the Scientific Committee report,ecosystem approach to fisheries management wwf and traffic welcome the intersessional work do and congratulate the scientific committee and its subsidiary body there be a number of area with respect to specie of special interest and broad ecosystem consideration that we would like to highlight species of special interest turtles populations of sea turtle be vulnerable to even smallscale adult mortality result from longline bycatch wwf and numerous partner be engage in collaborative trial for longline bycatch mitigation in the eastern and western pacific and have also encourage through the smartgear competition the development of innovative and adaptive fishing gear design to reduce bycatch we be encourage to see that many country catch tuna in the convention area be likewise test alternative gear such as circle hook wwf and traffic support the general recommendation for sea turtle datum collection and research of the scientific committee in 2006 particularly the identification of those fishery sector with a turtle bycatch problem as well as the recommendation for a flexible approach base on scientific research to sea turtle mitigation measure however this research must result in action in a timely manner as turtle bycatch hotspot be identify the commission must require concrete mitigation action from ccms such as widespread gear change seasonal closure in such hotspot rather than support an ongoing research programme sharks wwf and traffic be encourage by the recognition of the commission of the vulnerability of shark specie to the impact of fishing and the need to implement measure to mitigate these impact in this context traffic be close to complete an analysis of shark conservation measure adopt by other rfmo and have identify both deficiency and good practice arise from this analysis the analysis reiterate that the key to sustainable shark fishery be to understand and manage the level of mortality incur by fish effective management require reliable specie or stockspecific information on biology and total mortality landing and discard and precautionary limit in the face of uncertainty while all shark specie be relatively more vulnerable to overfishe than most other marine fish within the shark category the level of vulnerability vary considerably there be an urgent need to improve our understanding of shark mortality on a specie basis and it be important therefore that information be collect on this basis and that riskbase management measure be adopt for individual specie where necessary the approach adopt by a number of other rfmo in response to these requirement have be to implement ban on shark fin however the extent to which fin ban will achieve shark conservation depend on how they be apply the key element of the ban be the requirement to land both the trunk and the fin and there be

land head and gutte with skin fin clasper dorsal spine where applicable attach this approach maximise product quality and make a significant contribution to shark species identification quantification of weight of catch and enforcement it be also the approach recommend by fao in its technical guidelines for responsible fishery far to provide a basis for effective shark conservation into the future the cmm need to relate to all specie of the class chondrichthyes seabirds at its second annual session the commission recognize the need to take urgent action with respect to mitigate incidental catch of seabird and the need to cooperate with other organization in this quest we welcome the comprehensive recommendation from the scientific committee and tcc with regard to mitigation measure to be

WCPFC3-2006-OP03,6.0,Wider ecosystem issues Like the highly migratory fish stocks with which this Commission is primarily concerned ecosystem considerations and the impacts of fishing on the wider marine ecosystem are also transboundary It is crucial that a collaborative approach is taken to address fishing impacts on the ecosystem particularly on nontarget fish species and that measures to mitigate these impacts are applied in all waters where these occur whether under national jurisdiction or on the high seas In this regard States should ensure compatibility between waters under national jurisdiction and the high seas with respect to measures to mitigate these impacts An aspect of the Scientific Committees future work plan that WWF and TRAFFIC would like to highlight is the work to undertake an Ecological Risk Assessment ERA We welcome this initiative and look forward to the contribution it will make to prioritising species requiring targeted management action noting that this will also facilitate more effective use of the limited resources of the Commission Linked to this we welcome the intention to develop review models to evaluate impacts on the ecosystem including development of reference points identified in the Scientific Committees work programme and would encourage Members to provide funding to support this work With respect to the Regional Observer Programme ROP the ROP is a vital component of fisheries management in the WCPF Convention area The critical role of the ROP is recognized in the Convention text under Part VII Article 28 with further elaboration of its role and functions in Annex III There are obviously certain processes that have to be put in place to ensure that the ROP becomes fully functional however time is of the essence particularly when dealing with a resource base which in the absence of data and without proper management will quickly succumb to overfishing Of particular concern is that the current low observer coverage makes modelling for analyses of species of special interest problematic Therefore WWF and TRAFFIC fully support the recommendations of the Scientific Committee to extend the Regional Observer Programme coverage to ensure representative data collection across the WCPO,wider ecosystem issue like the highly migratory fish stock with which this commission be primarily concerned ecosystem consideration and the impact of fishing on the wide marine ecosystem be also transboundary it be crucial that a collaborative approach be take to address fishing impact on the ecosystem particularly on nontarget fish specie and that measure to mitigate these impact be apply in all water where these occur whether under national jurisdiction or on the high sea in this regard states should ensure compatibility between water under national jurisdiction and the high sea with respect to measure to mitigate these impact an aspect of the scientific committees future work plan that wwf and traffic would like to highlight be the work to undertake an ecological risk assessment era we welcome this initiative and look forward to the contribution it will make to prioritise specie require target management action note that this will also facilitate more effective use of the limited resource of the commission link to this we welcome the intention to develop review model to evaluate impact on the ecosystem include development of reference point identify in the scientific committees work programme and would encourage member to provide funding to support this work with respect to the regional observer programme rop the rop be a vital component of fishery management in the wcpf convention area the critical role of the rop be recognize in the convention text under part vii article 28 with further elaboration of its role and function in annex iii there be obviously certain process that have to be put in place to ensure that the rop become fully functional however time be of the essence particularly when deal with a resource base which in the absence of datum and without proper management will quickly succumb to overfishe of particular concern be that the current low observer coverage make modelling for analysis of specie of special interest problematic therefore wwf and traffic fully support the recommendation of the scientific committee to extend the regional observer programme coverage to ensure representative datum collection across the wcpo,Governance

WCPFC3-2006-OP04,3.0,Dear Mr Wright You asked recently for comments about the IATTC experience with measures to restrict fishing effort to conserve tuna stocks in the eastern Pacific Ocean I have prepared an outline of the measures adopted by the IATTC since 1966 which may be useful in your preparations for your meeting The IATTC successfully used a closure of the purseseine fishery in the Commissions Yellowfin Regulatory Area CYRA from 1966 to 1979 and subsequently with similar measures during 1998 2001 For a period between 1980 and 1985 it was not possible to reach agreement on the implementation of conservation measures and during 1986 to 1997 conservation measures were not necessary The closure allowed fishing to continue within the CYRA for other species so long as the catch of yellowfin did not exceed 15 of the total The closure of the CRYA for purseseine fishing for yellowfin was a successful measure because 90 of the yellowfin catch was taken by purseseine fishing outside the CYRA caught large yellowfin catches of which had a relatively small impact the stock purseseine fishing that targeted skipjack was not affected by the closure In 1998 the IATTC introduced its first measure to control purseseine catches of bigeye tuna by prohibiting sets on floating objects after 45000 t of bigeye had been taken Resolution C9805 A similar measure was adopted in 1999 Resolution C9906 and provisionally for 2000 Resolution C9909 However there was a very strong recruitment of bigeye in 1998 producing very large catches in which would have lead to the fishery on floating objects being closed in the middle of the year with very serious repercussion of the catches of skipjack Eventually the Commission,dear mr wright you ask recently for comment about the iattc experience with measure to restrict fishing effort to conserve tuna stock in the eastern pacific ocean i have prepare an outline of the measure adopt by the iattc since 1966 which may be useful in your preparation for your meeting the iattc successfully use a closure of the purseseine fishery in the commissions yellowfin regulatory area cyra from 1966 to 1979 and subsequently with similar measure during 1998 2001 for a period between 1980 and 1985 it be not possible to reach agreement on the implementation of conservation measure and during 1986 to 1997 conservation measure be not necessary the closure allow fishing to continue within the cyra for other specie so long as the catch of yellowfin do not exceed 15 of the total the closure of the crya for purseseine fishing for yellowfin be a successful measure because 90 of the yellowfin catch be take by purseseine fishing outside the cyra catch large yellowfin catch of which have a relatively small impact the stock purseseine fishing that target skipjack be not affect by the closure in 1998 the iattc introduce its first measure to control purseseine catch of bigeye tuna by prohibit set on float object after 45000 t of bigeye have be take resolution c9805 a similar measure be adopt in 1999 resolution c9906 and provisionally for 2000 resolution c9909 however there be a very strong recruitment of bigeye in 1998 produce very large catch in which would have lead to the fishery on float object be close in the middle of the year with very serious repercussion of the catch of skipjack eventually the commission,Governance
WCPFC3-2006-OP04,4.0,closed the fishery on floating objects from 15 September to 15 December 2000 Resolution C02 During the brief period that management measures had been adopted for bigeye tuna two difficulties arose The first was in determining in advance the appropriate TAC for bigeye This was particularly important because purseseine catches bigeye were taken as a minor catch in sets on floating objects While stopping fishing for bigeye too early may not have been serious from the point of view of catches of bigeye it would have been a more serious issue if skipjack catches were curtailed unnecessarily The objectives of management measures for bigeye tuna and the means of achieving them have varied The initial concern during the 1990s with purseseine catches of bigeye on FADs was that the fishery particularly selected small bigeye tuna The Commission tended to equate purse seine caught bigeye with small or immature bigeye and restrictions were aimed at reducing all purseseine catches However in 2000 the bigeye taken by purseseine vessels were medium sized indicating the fishery could catch a wider range of sizes than hitherto thought In 2001 the bigeye closure was modified to be triggered by the estimated catch of bigeye less than 60cm Resolution C0106 There was also an emerging problem in monitoring sets on floating objects Even with vessels carrying an observer there was a trend for the vessel to make sets including or near floating objects and to claim there were on an unassociated school In addition the use of FADs which were spread throughout the fishery started to produce catches of small bigeye and to a lesser extent yellowfin outside the CYRA A CYRA closure was not effective for bigeye and its rational for yellowfin was weakened As a result of these issues the management measures for purseseine fishing were switched from TAC based measures to measures to limit fishing effort This was particularly convenient in when the recommended reductions in effort for bigeye and yellowfin were comparable and the conservation resolution for 2002 Resolution C0204 simply closed the whole EPO to purseseine fishing during the month of December In 2003 the December closure was limited to an area of the EPO that contained a large part of the fishery in association with FADs shown in figure 1 below Resolution C0312 In a subsequent analysis of the effect of the closed area it was determined that the reduction in catch attributed to the closure was negligible and that overall the closure was ineffective SAR06 2004 Stock Assessment Working Group This was because the closure was both too short and the area was too small allowing the fleet to make good catches of yellowfin and bigeye tuna outside the closed area In 2003 it was also agreed that the fishery in all of the EPO should be closed to purseseining during 1 August to 11 September 2004 The dates for 2004 were chosen as the period in which there would be the greatest reduction of catches of small bigeye compared to the reduction of skipjack catch The time of the year made little difference for yellowfin catches The Resolution also required that the longline catches of bigeye tuna of each CPC be restricted to the level of their catch in 2001 This was the first binding limit on longline catches in the eastern Pacific In fact in 2004 there was a debate about the most appropriate period for a closure and in the event,close the fishery on float object from 15 september to 15 december 2000 resolution c02 during the brief period that management measure have be adopt for bigeye tuna two difficulty arise the first be in determine in advance the appropriate tac for bigeye this be particularly important because purseseine catch bigeye be take as a minor catch in set

Tahiti PACIFIC BIGEYE TUNA WWF and TRAFFIC note than the WCPFC Scientific Committee SC supported the evaluation of the Conservation and Management Measure CMM document CMM200801 WCPFCSC52009GNWP17 This evaluation concluded CMM200801 is highly unlikely to meet its objectives of a 30 reduction in bigeye tuna fishing mortality from the 20012004 level or maintenance of the bigeye tuna stock at a level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield MSY over the long term The measures are predicted to result in little if any reduction in bigeye tuna FFmsy from the high levels in excess of 20 estimated for 20072008 and accordingly SB is predicted to fall to around 0406 of SBmsy The SC requested that the Science Service Provider SPC provide analyses to WCPFC6 of a range of scenarios including adjustments of the current CMM to remove exemptions as well as other measures to reduce fishing mortality on bigeye tuna to 30 below 20012004 levels According to the report provided by the SPC WCPFC62009IP18 the following scenario was the only one that ended overfishing and prevented bigeye from becoming overfished by 2018 a 50 reduction in longline catches from 2007 levels an 80 reduction in fishaggregating device FAD effort from 2007 levels and a 50 reduction in effort from the domestic fisheries in Indonesia and the Philippines for 2007 levels WWF and TRAFFIC note the SC management advice that a 34 to 50 average of 43 reduction in fishing mortality for bigeye tuna from 20042007 levels is required to end overfishing The SC report also states that the results of more conservative assumptions are that a 61 reduction in fishing mortality is required to end overfishing The findings of the SPC and the SC demonstrate significant uncertainty and therefore precautionary management decisions are necessary WWF and TRAFFIC support conservation and management measures that achieve an immediate 43 reduction in fishing mortality of bigeye tuna in accordance with SC advice

mortality on juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna WCPFC62009DP07 This represents progress from the voluntary agreement currently in place but falls short of scientific advice WWF and TRAFFIC recommend adoption of WCPFC62009DP07 along with a commitment to adopt a 3year management plan in 2010 that follows scientific advice to reduce fishing mortality of juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna below the 20022004 level SHARKS WWF and TRAFFIC note that the CMM for sharks still needs strengthening further than just adding silky shark to the list of key species WCPFC62009IP14 It needs to be made mandatory the term key species needs to reflect species at high risk and the finning measures need strengthening to naturally attached with the introduction of a productlabelling scheme to monitor compliance with the measures MANAGEMENT ADVICE AND IMPLICATIONS WWF and TRAFFIC note the range of management advice provided by the SC on bigeye tuna Management advice to WCPFC 6 included SC recommends a reduction in fishing mortality of 30 from the 20012004 level in order to return fishing mortality to MSY levels Fmsy SC recommends that the Commission note that recent estimates of FFmsy 151201 reference years 2007 indicate that fishing mortality has increased significantly since 20012004 therefore the streamlined assessment indicates a reduction in fishing mortality of 3450 from the 2004 to levels would be required though there are some uncertainties The current management advice and interpretations of stock status are confusing and difficult to compare from year to year Without clear guidance from the Commission on the objectives of fisheries management decisions it is difficult for the SC to provide management advice that informs fisheries managers of the probability of conservation and management measures achieving the objectives WWF and TRAFFIC recommend that WCPFC set Biological Reference Points for the species it manages including sharks WWF and TRAFFIC remind WCPFC that the Second Joint Meeting of Tuna RFMOs Kobe II in June 2009 recommended the use of the Kobe II Strategy Matrix to improve the presentation of scientific advice making it simple and useful to fisheries managers In November 2009 ICCAT requested scientific advice related to the conservation and management of Atlantic bluefin tuna be provided in the format of the Kobe II Strategy Matrix WWF and TRAFFIC recommend that WCPFC request Management Advice and Implications for the 2010 assessment of bigeye tuna and skipjack tuna in the format of the Kobe II Strategy Matrix INDEPENDENT PERFORMANCE REVIEW The First Joint Meeting of Tuna RFMOs Kobe I in January 2007 agreed to pursue a 14 point Course of Action to improve management of all tuna stocks Point 9 of that action plan was an agreement that the five tuna RFMOs should have their performance reviewed according to a common methodology and a common set of criteria The goal of the reviews is to help the RFMOs improve their effectiveness in achieving their objectives These reviews were to commence as soon as practicable and conducted by a team that includes individuals already associated with the RFMO as well as outside experts Kobe II encouraged WCPFC and the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC to conduct performance reviews as soon as possible to the commitment made in 2007 WWF and TRAFFIC call on WCPFC to follow the recommendation of Technical and Compliance Committee TCC TCC5 and agree to conduct an independent performance review to begin early in 2010 REGIONAL OBSERVER PROGRAM WWF and TRAFFIC were encouraged by the technical improvements made to the WCPFC Regional Observer Program ROP at WCPFC5 as well as the recent progress on the ROP at TCC5 including an agreement to establish a Technical and Operational Advisory Group Establishing a solid foundation on which to operate such a program is vital but the absence of any specific discussion such as a phasein period for regional observer coverage or increasing the overall coverage from 5 is disappointing Global attention by fishing nations is now focused on the western and central Pacific Ocean WCPO and it is urgent that WCPFC implement critical fisheries management measures such as systematic observer coverage Current levels of observer coverage and even the 5 goal to which WCPFC aspires do not come close to providing adequate data to support robust stock assessment and management In 2008 WWF and TRAFFIC recommended a 5year timetable to phasein 100 ROP coverage for all fishing vessels starting with 100 coverage for purseseine vessels and support vessels for high seas fishing ROP coverage for longline fishing vessels could be phased in over five years WWF and TRAFFICs position is that there are no reasonable impediments to immediate introduction of 100 observer coverage for purse seine catcher vessels and all support vessels while full observer for longliners is phasedin over five years WWF and TRAFFIC call on WCPFC6 to implement a phasein plan to achieve 100 observer coverage as soon as practically possible CATCH DOCUMENTATION SCHEME WWF and TRAFFIC recently produced a joint report The Case for a Catch Documentation Scheme in the Western and Central Pacific which provides recommendations for the implementation of an electronic Catch Documentation Scheme eCDS in the WCPFC It is time for the WCPFC to take urgent action to address overfishing and to support and enforce that action by the introduction of an eCDS WCPFC needs to ensure that all high seas fish stocks it manages be subject to the eCDS as a proactive precautionary measure WWF and TRAFFIC note the recommendation from TCC5 to create an intersessional working group on catch documentation to advance the development of a CDS during 2010 This working group is an opportunity for WCPFC to overcome the challenges of implementing a CDS rather than using those challenges as an excuse to implement secondbest solutions WWF and

WCPFC7-2010-OP02,44.0,Threatened or Near Threatened These data confirm that RFMOs are not sustainably managing the high seas fisheries for which the global community holds them accountable The challenge to the WCPFC is to defy this trend and chart a course towards a sustainable future Given its more modern and comprehensive mandate the WCPFC has the ability to apply current international best practice in fisheries management so that the tuna sharks and other fisheries under its remit do not follow the same path as those managed by RFMOs in other regions In this regard the WCPFC has an opportunity in 2010 to ensure that strong and effective CMMs are in place and effectively implemented by CCMs It also has the opportunity to implement scientifically sound precautionary measures to protect the ecological and economic viability of tuna and shark populations and the ecosystems on which they depend Many member countries of the WCPFC have been operating under bilateral and multilateral access agreements with one or more Parties to the Nauru Agreement PNA to ensure access for their tuna fleets Some of these agreements are being renegotiated as we speak While some of these agreements could contain more effective conservation measures than have been agreed by the Commission others could contain measures that would be obstacles to progress by the Commission It is important that access agreements are not obstacles to the agreement or implementation of conservation and management measures Sustainability must be mainstreamed into all access agreements In order to increase the effectiveness of the WCPFC and its primary role of managing and conserving tuna and other fisheries under its remit the Pew Environment Group encourages the Commission to integrate these agreements into the Commissions processes In this regard we would encourage parties to consider including provisions from the PSMA and a greater attention to the conservation and management of sharks both in these access agreements and the WCPFC provisions as a whole At this 7th Regular Session of the WCPFC there are opportunities to create a new era of sustainability Although the capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change challenge these opportunities the adoption of strong precautionary conservation and management measures by WCPFC CCMs can help mitigate these challenges This

sustainability in the WCPFC tuna fisheries is the inability of the purse seine fishery to significantly reduce the mortality of juvenile bigeye tuna when setting on floating objects Provisional bigeye tuna catches of 118675 metric tons mt exceeded the maximum sustainable yield MSY of 840 mt by 618 Extreme overfishing is now occurring and the stock may already be in an overfished state Additionally the spawning potential of bigeye tuna is now down to of unfished levels9 As in other RFMOs it appears that management advice is being repeatedly ignored while the status of the stocks spirals towards collapse A number of recommendations on tuna shark and other bycatch species management were supported by participants in the Kobe II Bycatch Workshops to present to RFMOs The challenge of juvenile bigeye bycatch is clearly a concern shared by CCMs as evidenced by the amount of research on potential solutions In the past year alone research on acoustic identification techniques underwater monitoring systems escape panels and light stimuli has been undertaken by a variety of CCMs but no conclusive solutions have been identified Although more research will always be needed significant action must be taken immediately to alleviate fishing pressure on this imperiled stock based on what is known today There is one very simple and effective solution that can be immediately implemented Reduce juvenile bigeye bycatch to a level that will stop overfishing and allow the stocks to begin to rebuild Based on the results presented at the last Scientific Committee SC6 on the effectiveness of the FAD closure on reducing juvenile bycatch10 the Pew Environment Group urges WCPFC countries to agree to significantly extend FAD closures or to establish a limit on the number of FAD sets allowed throughout the year in order to ensure a reduction in juvenile bigeye bycatch These should be accompanied by robust reporting and monitoring provisions so that the Commission has access to meaningful data on bycatch the number of FADs being employed and the frequency and results of fishing on FADs This information should be actively reviewed 2 Fishing Beyond MSY To ensure that WCPFC

WCPFC7-2010-OP02,58.0,Information from the WCPFC Scientific Committee indicates that skipjack purse seine catches continue to soar In 2009 purse seine catches were approximately 500000 metric tons mt beyond the longterm MSY of 1350000mta record tonnage for the region11See Table 1 Likewise the effort that this record number of vessels exerts on the resource already exceeds the longterm sustainable take for skipjack The complex problem of overcapacity is a challenge that WCPFC countries must tackle immediately before fishing pressure on the skipjack fishery reaches dangerous levels Further purse seine fisherys high level of bigeye bycatch is a primary factor in driving the bigeye population towards collapse It must be noted also that MSY is now widely recognized as an absolute minimum below which fishing should not continue The Pew Environment Group urges CCMs to modify CMM200801 to reflect the most recent science from the SPC and to put precautionary caps on catches of all tuna species until scientifically sound limit and target reference points have been identified 3 High Seas Pocket Closures The High Seas Closures to Purse Seine Fishing Vessels as proposed by the PNA provide a clear and concrete opportunity for the WCPFC to follow scientific advice through precautionary measures thereby conserving tuna and other species and combating IUU fishing The PNA proposal follows advice from the Scientific Committee on the need for additional measures to conserve bigeye tuna see further below Keeping the existing areas closed and closing these additional areas to fishing not only provides protection for marine life between the rich fishing grounds of the surrounding EEZs it also helps stop IUU fishing and reduce the problem of additional invisible overfishing efforts These closures reinforce other efforts by the WCPFC for the conservation and management of important tuna and other fish in the Convention Area as well as helping ensure that Pacific Island Countries are not cheated out of income as fish caught within EEZs may be falsely disguised as high seas catch to avoid payment of access fees The Pew Environment Group encourages CCMs to support the additional

Convention Area where it can undermine conservation and management measures inhibit stock rebuilding efforts increase overfishing and threaten food and livelihood security for poor coastal communities in developing countries14 IUU fishing also has a direct effect on competitiveness because it ignores labor and safety standards and distorts trade and market prices The WCPFC has taken a number of important steps to combat IUU fishing including the closure of high seas pockets as mentioned earlier However those engaged in IUU fishing activity have shown in the past and in other fisheries that they can quickly modify their operations to adapt to new measures Therefore it is important that individual States and the WCPFC remain vigilant to possible increases in IUU activity and use all available tools to combat it in the Convention Area PSMs are an effective way to ensure the effective enforcement of management measures by substantially reducing the profitability of IUU fishing operations through denying port entry transshipment and other services to IUU vessels15 We recognize that technical and financial assistance must be available to small island developing States to

implement the UN Port State Measures Agreement which once in force will close ports to vessels involved in IUU fishing The Port State Measures Agreement Implementation Toolkit Ports play a major role in the fishing industry They give vessels and crews access to essential services and supplies and enable vessel operators to offload their catch and transport it to market However ports can also provide a lifeline for illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing an activity that undermines the very essence of global ocean governance threatens the sustainable use of marine resources and consequently the social and economic wellbeing of the coastal communities and countries that depend on them The United Nations Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing Port State Measures Agreement or PSMA adopted in November 2009 by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization FAO is an ambitious international agreement that aims to stop the use of ports by IUU fishing and support vessels It provides port States with a set of highly costeffective measures that when implemented globally and effectively will ensure that a countrys ports are closed to IUU fishing fleets For this to be possible particularly in the ports of developing countries a comprehensive set of tools is needed to support the practical implementation of the Agreement As part of its commitment to improve ocean governance the Pew Environment Group is developing the PSMA Implementation Toolkit The toolkit aims to help developing countries identify their capacity needs provide them with key information and guide them through the most technical and detailed elements of the Agreement The toolkit is an open and evolving set of practical materials developed using ontheground experience Input from potential users is a key element of the toolkits evolution To achieve this we encourage collaboration with national and regional authorities in the ongoing development of these materials The first tools in the toolkit Capacity Needs Assessment Methodology Implementation of the PSMA requires an adequate welltrained fisheries inspectorate that has good levels of communication and coordination between domestic agencies such as customs and port authorities and cooperates with relevant regional and global bodies In collaboration with the Nordenfjeldske Development Services NFDS the New Partnership for Africas Development NEPAD and six African countries the Pew Environment Group has developed a simple and robust methodology that can be used to determine a countrys specific capacitybuilding needs The methodology also provides a platform for the development of a capacity building plan which when implemented would ensure that the country has adequate capacity to comply with its obligations under the PSMA The full Capacity Needs Assessment methodology report is available at wwwpewenvironmentorgIUUfishing The PSMA Implementation Handbook The PSMA is an extensive instrument that provides a new set of technical measures to be implemented at the domestic and international levels This requires greater coordination among countries increased capacity in all relevant agencies fisheries customs ports etc and in many cases new procedures for decisionmaking vessel inspections and reporting domestically to flag States and internationally The Pew Environment Group in collaboration with experts in the field and government authorities is currently producing the PSMA implementation handbook The handbook will translate the PSMAs technical and legal text into clear and practical tools to help government agencies and their enforcement personnel implement the Agreement effectively The PSMA implementation handbook will be available in early 2011 Combined IUU Vessel Database IUU operators are skilled at disguising and hiding their activities and often remain undetected by port authorities The Pew Environment Groups research on Port State Performance documented some alarming situations in apparently wellregulated ports As called for in Article 16 of the PSMA a global informationsharing mechanism is essential if domestic regional and international authorities are to keep track of IUU activities As a first contribution the Pew Environment Group has developed the combined IUU vessel database which draws together all publicly available information on IUU vessels officially listed by Regional Fishery Management Organizations On launch the database will provide an uptodate resource that will enhance informationsharing among relevant officials The list will be made available to the International Monitoring Control and Surveillance IMCS Network which will host and maintain it The Combined IUU vessels database will be available in early 2011 The Port State Performance Research can be found at wwwportstateperformanceorg To find out more about the PSMA implementation toolkit please contact Adriana Fabra AFabraconsultant pewtrustsorg The Pew Environment Group has conducted a gap analysis comparing the port State measures PSMs established by 10 Regional Fisheries Management Organizations RFMOs with those established by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing PSMA or Agreement The research assesses the extent to which measures adopted by these RFMOs meet the PSMAs standards and identifies those aspects which need to be further developed by each RFMO in order that their measures become aligned with the Agreements The newly adopted PSMA represents an international minimum standard on PSMs and provides a unique opportunity to harmonise and strengthen Port State controls globally RFMOs have a special role to play in this process and specifically in helping to combat illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing on the high seas This document presents the preliminary findings of this gap analysis for WCPFC based on information that was publicly available up to 31 July 2010 We invite WCPFCs Contracting Parties CPs to assist in refining this analysis by commenting on the information provided and providing additional information where appropriate The preliminary aim of this exercise is to identify specific gaps in WCPFCs conservation and management measures in relation to the PSMA and make clear recommendations to WCPFC for improvement The longterm aim is to provide information to States and RFMOs to help eliminate IUU fishing A full report on this study with specific conclusions and recommendations for each of the RFMOs analysed will be released early in 2011 Gap analysis Comparing WCPFCs port State measures with those in the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing PRELIMINARY FINDINGS In November 2009 the FAO adopted the PSMA providing a set of highly effective tools to be used by port States to combat IUU fishing such as the designation of ports where foreign vessels may request entry the prohibition of entry into port the prohibition of landing the prohibition of transshipping and the refusal of other port services to IUU fishing vessels the carrying out of inspections in port and the adoption of enforcement measures The Pew Environment Group strongly supports the earliest possible entry into force of the Agreement and welcomes the fact that 15 States and the European Union have signed it The PSMA establishes the current international minimum standard on PSMs targeting IUU fishing which should be followed by States even prior to the Agreements official entry into force In addition to each States individual efforts to ratify the Agreement steps should be taken within the framework of RFMOs to ensure that PSMs adopted in the regional context are adjusted to meet the new international minimum standard PSMs will only be truly effective in combating IUU fishing if they are enforced in a uniform manner globally RFMOs and the PSMA can reinforce each other Not only are RFMOs essential to the effective implementation of the PSMA in a regional context but the PSMA if implemented by a critical number of States can support the role of RFMOs by improving overall compliance with RFMO conservation and management measures RichaRd caReyFotolia ThE PoRT STATE MEASuRES AGREEMENT AND RFMoS Preliminary findings of this research indicate that the PSMs of most RFMOs have not yet reached the standard contained in the PSMA Most importantly RFMOs have not comprehensively covered all IUU fishing activity their PSMs are not sufficiently effective in deterring the IUU operators and their requirements on transparency and information sharing are inadequate In general the study finds that there are several aspects of port State controls that are especially under regulated through RFMO regimes such as the denial of port entry refusal of port services and minimum standards for inspections Full implementation of the PSMA by States and RFMOs will significantly increase the feasibility of truly combating IUU fishing ibon baRandika UgaRtetxe ShiPSPottingcoM WCPFC While this is a qualitative and not quantitative scale and methodology it does provide a useful tool for comparative analyses between RFMOs and for an independent analysis of individual RFMOs The study shows that RFMO measures are rarely an exact match of a PSMA provision However a comparison of the measures in place in the different regimes enables both general and specific conclusions about the current state of development of PSMs at the regional level We are aware that RFMOs have their own particularities and face challenges that make their regulatory systems including PSMs different from each other However in analysing PSMs developed by 10 different RFMOs we have tried to keep our analysis as objective as possible focusing on the degree of conformity of such rules with the PSMA It is undeniable that IUU fishing on the high seas is a common challenge for all RFMOs The more the RFMOs apply a common standard on PSMs the better they will be able to face this challenge The comparison conducted under this analysis indicates the principal steps that RFMOs should take if they are to reach the international minimum standard provided by the PSMA Undertaking a gap analysis what is missing from RFMO rules The study conducted by the Pew Environment Group focuses on 10 RFMOs that have adopted regulations currently in force and published that include some form of PSM1,pew environment group philadelphia pa 19103 tel 1 215 575 2000 washington dc 20004 tel 1 202 552 2000 brussels belgium tel

WCPFC7-2010-OP02,72.0,In order to compare the measures adopted by each of the reviewed RFMOs with the PSMAs measures a review of the Agreement including its annexes was conducted and its provisions deconstructed into more than 100 obligations Subsequently all potentially relevant RFMO measures were reviewed and those that contain PSMs applicable to fishing or fishingrelated activities were compared obligation by obligation with the obligations provided by the PSMA In order to assess the alignment between RFMO measures and those contained in the PSMA we have taken into account the objective pursued by the PSMA obligation the effect of each RFMO measure in its regulatory context and the clarity of the RFMO measures analysed To facilitate communicating the results of this research we have systematised our conclusions under a number of PSM categories These categories correspond closely to the main parts of the PSMA scope cooperation and informationsharing portdesignation and priortoentry information denial of entry and port use inspections and the role of the flag State To illustrate the alignment between RFMO measures and the PSMAs we have allocated a grade from 0 to 10 showing our assessment of the degree of conformity on each measure See Figure 1 for a representation of preliminary results for These are Commission for the Conservation of

IATTC International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ICCAT Indian Ocean Tuna Commission IOTC Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization NAFO North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission NEAFC South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation SEAFO Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC According to the WCPF Convention port States have the right and the duty to take measures to promote the effectiveness of subregional regional and global conservation and management measures However the Commission has yet to adopt any CMM establishing a comprehensive system of port State controls to prevent deter and eliminate IUU fishing Structure and scope According to art 27 of the WCPFC Convention2a port State has the right and the duty to take measures to promote the effectiveness of subregional regional and global conservation and management measures However there is not one single CMM that provides coverage of all port State controls Thus far the Commission has adopted a number of CMMs containing some PSMs that regulate specific situations3 but a comprehensive and systematic approach to PSMs is lacking With one exception WCPFC does not exclude domestic vessels from the application of PSMs although the PSMA does4 Although WCPFCs PSMs apply to carrier and support vessels its definition of fishing does not include some of the fishingrelated activities mentioned by the PSMA thus setting a more limited standard than the Agreement5 The PSMA incorporates the definition of IUU fishing provided by paragraph 3 of the International Plan of Action to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing IPOAIUU WCPFC expressly refers to this definition of IUU fishing in the context of its CMM for IUUlisted vessels However the Conventions more general provision to deny landing and transshipment in port only refers to situations of non compliance with CMMs and not to IUU fishing broadly6 As a result of all this WCPFCs PSMs have a narrower scope than those contained in the PSMA Information exchangeinformation systems and cooperation WCPFC has developed several provisions on the need to cooperate with the FAO other RFMOs and in particular IATTC including cooperation on monitoring control and surveillance measures7 There is also a partial recognition of IUU vessel lists adopted by other RFMOs since vessels listed by any RFMO will be removed from the WCPFC register of authorised carrier vessels8 Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean

the WCPFC Convention See also CMM 20090122 CMM 20090137 Information pertinent to WCPFCs lists of authorised vessels is to be transmitted electronically These lists and WCPFCs IUU vessel lists are available online at WCPFCs website9 These obligations are consistent with the PSMA provisions that require port States to establish communication mechanisms that allow for direct electronic exchange of information mainly art 16 and Annex D However WCPFC does not establish obligations to notify relevant parties of actions taken at port such as denial of port use or the results of port inspection10 These obligations are essential for the effectiveness of PSMs and have been developed in detail by the PSMA Designation and capacity of ports Under WCPFC rules a Member may notify the Executive Director of its designated ports for transshipments The Executive Director will periodically circulate the list of designated ports to all Members11 However there are no provisions requiring Members to use designated ports for transshipments Furthermore there is no regulation of designation of ports for uses other than transshipment or to ensure that ports of WCPFC Members have the required capacity to conduct inspections Priortoentry information According to the PSMA port States shall require vessels to provide a minimum set of information described in Annex A prior to entry with sufficient time to allow for port State authorities to examine the information WCPFC does not have any requirements to provide information prior to entry Denial of entry except for inspection and effective action One of the central obligations of the PSMA is the denial of entry into port to IUU fishing and support vessels except for the purposes of inspecting and taking other actions against these vessels these actions need to be as effective as denial of entry in deterring IUU fishing WCPFC CMMs do not require Members to deny entry to IUU fishing vessels However in the case of IUUlisted vessels CMMs require Members to inspect all such vessels and to not authorise them to land transship refuel or resupply Since WCPFC does not require Members to take other actions against these vessels and does not prohibit other port services such as repairing and drydocking this provision sets a slightly lower standard than the PSMAs in relation to IUUlisted vessels In addition this provision does not apply any port restrictions to other nonlisted IUU vessels contrary to what is required by the Agreement12 Port use The PSMA requires port States to deny use of ports including access to port services of any kind to vessels engaged in IUU fishing Under WCFPC measures Members shall not allow IUUlisted vessels to land CMM 20070323 and CMM 20090113 See arts 113 and 15 of the PSMA Art 291 of the WCPFC Convention CMM 2009065 CMM 20070322 b WCPFC should urgently develop standards for conducting inspections and require port States to inspect vessels even if they are not IUUlisted require vessels to provide information prior to entry into ports and mandate States to notify relevant parties of all actions taken at port PRELIMINARY FINDINGS oN WCPFCS PSMS AND ThEIR ALIGNMENT WITh ThE PSMA transship refuel or resupply but there is no reference to denying other port services included in the PSMA13 In addition to its measures against IUUlisted vessels WCPFC prohibits landings and transshipments from vessels not included on the WCPFCs lists of authorised vessels14 and from vessels that do not have the required license from a coastal State15 There are also species specific prohibitions of landings and transshipments16 Inspections Under WCPFC rules Members are only required to inspect IUUlisted vessels thus covering a very limited category of vessels when compared with the PSMA In addition WCPFC has not developed rules about how inspections should be conducted Although Annex III of the Convention gives some guidance on conducting transshipment inspections including transshipment in port17 WCPFC has not yet developed any measure requiring Members to inspect vessels transshipping in port Finally WCPFC has not developed any guidelines on the training of port inspectors as required by the PSMA art 17 and Annex E Flag States Art 20 of the PSMA includes a set of flag State obligations Arts 96 and 111 of the PSMA also prohibit packaging processing maintenance and drydocking to these vessels WCPFC has a Record of Fishing Vessels and an Interim Register of Non Member Carrier and Bunker Vessels authorised to fish and operate in the Convention Area beyond national jurisdictions CMM 200901 CMM 2009014 c 16 and 17 These prohibitions apply to shark fins CMM 2009049 and tuna products CMM 200801 42 Art 42 and Annex II of the Convention For more information please contact Adriana Fabra AFabraConsultantpewtrustsorg wwwPewEnvironmentorgIUUfishing designed to facilitate the implementation of PSMs The Agreement also requires flag States to take action against a vessel when an inspection report indicates that the vessel was involved in IUU fishing The WCPFC Convention includes provisions requiring flag States to fully investigate any alleged violation by fishing vessels flying its flag upon reception of relevant information and to take action against such vessels18 Although these obligations are rather prescriptive they do not make any reference to port inspections Since there is no obligation under WCPFC to transmit port inspection reports to the flag State these flag State obligations are not likely to be realised under WCPFC rules in the same way as is required by the PSMA Ten steps to WCPFC compliance with the PSMA Give effect to the WCPFC Conventions recognition that port States have the right and the duty to take

notify the executive director of its designate port for transshipment the executive director will periodically circulate the list of designate port to all members11 however there be no provision

inspect all such vessel and to not authorise they to land transship refuel or resupply since wcpfc do not require member to take other action against these vessel and do not prohibit other port

Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission PO Box 2356 Kolonia Pohnpei 96941 Federated States of Micronesia Via EMail wcpfcwcpfcint Re WCPFC Consideration of IUU and BRPs issues Dear Commission Members On behalf of the Western Fishboat Owners Association WFOA I am writing to request the Commission to consider two items of importance to North American albacore fishermen A growing concern in our fisheries is evidence of growing IUU fishery that has potential to impair albacore production The second Item is the need to establishing the biological reference points being developed by the International Scientific Committees Albacore Working Group At WFOA meetings and on phone conversations my members bring up evidence of continuing IUU fishing along the North Pacific Transition Zone I would like to point out some of the IUU related observations that are coming to light in recent years North American trollers have observed illegal high seas gill net operations on several occasions and have notified authorities of the incidences This occurred this summer when US vessels notified authorities in Hawaii that resulted in an aircraft being sent to the sighting area but the response was delayed due to communication problems so the aircraft arrived on scene too late to locate any vessels I have photos on file of IUU vessels operating gillnets in the transition zone in 14 16 C surface temperature the preferred temperature of albacore The photos were taken by an albacore troll vessel engaged in trolling and catching albacore when it came upon the IUU vessel The growing number of gillnet marked albacore is of great concern Some of our fishermen that spend a great deal of time in the central Pacific estimate that 15 of the fish exhibit gillnet marks This suggests that the IUU take of albacore could be quite high since the 15 represent only fish that have escaped One fisherman reported finding a long panel of gillnet gear in the region of 43N 145W that was new and did not have any fouling or discoloration Reports from beach cleanup operations in Alaska show remnants of high seas drift gillnets come ashore in many locations in the Gulf of Alaska another indication of potentially high IUU effort in the North Pacific Ocean We note that the severe downturn in albacore abundance experienced in the late 1980s coincide with Page 1 of 3 the development of the high seas driftnet fishery Catches fell off steadily from about 1986 reaching a low in 1991 when US landed only 1900 tons After an international prohibition of large high seas nets the fishery recovered quickly to average levels by 1996 WFOA members are very concerned about illegal high seas fishing and the effect the on albacores sustainability On behalf of my members I request that the WCPFC and IATTC continue to work toward ending IUU fishing in the North Pacific Ocean Further I urge the WCPFC IATTC and coastal states to work together to develop an effective IUU monitoring and enforcement system WFOA and other North American fishermen feel strongly that it is futile to try to establish an effective management regime while a potentially significant portion of the catch is unaccounted for WFOA stands ready to assist through atsea observation of vessel activity and reporting of IUU gear Our second item of concern is the adoption of biological reference points for North Pacific fisheries WFOA recently received Marine Steward Council MSC certification for albacore landed by all US troll and baitboat fishermen in the North Pacific Under the conditions of certification WFOA is required to communicate the need for regional fisheries management organizations to develop biological reference points to monitor the state of the harvest relative to stock status WFOA supports the development of reference points to insure the long term sustainability of the resource on which our fishermen depend for their livelihood and recognizes the progress made by the ISC Albacore Working Group that has been actively engaged in developing a framework of recommendations At a meeting of the working group in Shimizu Japan in April of 2009 the subject of biological reference points was discussed extensively and recommendations and requests for guidance were sent to the ISC and the Northern Committee The Northern Committee NC of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC at its sixth regular session in September 2010 confirmed that the interim management objective for North Pacific albacore is to maintain the spawning stock biomass SSB above the average level of its 10 historically lowest points ATHL The fishing mortality rate that would likely cause SSB to fall below this level with a probability greater than 50 is referred to as the interim reference point IRP At a recent October 2010 meeting the group discussed the ISC Chairs request for species specific reference points and noted that an interim objective to maintain the spawning stock biomass SSB above the average level of its ten historically lowest points ATHL with a probability greater than 50 has been established for north Pacific albacore and that the associated Fbased reference point FSSBATHLwill be estimated in future stock assessments The FSSB reference point concept was proposed to the WG in 2005 to ensure that SSB in future years remains within the range

working with him in the near future This 7th Commission meeting is a critical meeting since tuna is increasingly seen around the world as under threat giving this meeting the opportunity to set things right by preventing the fishery from becoming the next casualty of rampant global overfishing The future of the Pacific and its people will be in your hands as you make decisions this week Greenpeace would like to commend the leadership and continued efforts by all the Pacific Island countries that are members of the Commission to secure and safeguard the future of this fishery In particular The Parties to the Nauru Agreement PNA for taking the bold and positive step by agreeing to the implementation of the 3rd Implementing Arrangement and we urge this Commission to adopt compatible measures as mandated by the Convention This year the WCPFC Scientific Committee SC reported that measures agreed in 2008 do not go far enough to halt overfishing in the region and the crisis facing particularly bigeye stocks continues to deepen Signs of decline in even the once robust skipjack stock are now starting to appear as a result of massive fishing capacity and deadly efficiency These declines are placing great threats on the regions food security and economic prosperity and the current mismanagement is undermining the marine ecosystem and the fishing industry itself This is a huge wakeup call for the region Time and tuna are running out The Commission continues to fail in its mandate to conserve the regions precious tuna resources and unless firm decisions are taken in Hawaii it is on a path to repeat the same mistakes of other failed Tuna Commissions and faces the risk of becoming redundant as the competent body for sustainably managing the regions highly migratory fish stocks Following the debacle of bluefin tuna under ICCATs mismanagement attention is turning to other species of tuna heading to same fate especially bigeye and yellowfin tuna of the WCPO The worlds markets are beginning to reject unsustainable tuna including skipjack originating from purse seine FAD associated fisheries Greenpeace will continue to expose to the public the unsustainable and wasteful practices of tuna fishing globally and corporate players responsible for the continued use of these methods The WCPFC member countries would be wise to embrace,opening statement to the seventh regular session of the western and central pacific fisheries commission wcpfc 10 december honolulu hawaii mr chairman the executive director honorable delegate fellow observer lady and

of the Commission VMS regarding east and west of 175E north of 20N is not consistent with The Law of the Sea article 119 part 3 and therefore should be amended Noting that from the year 2001 to the

WCPFC8-2011-OP01,6.0,High Seas Driftnets still prevail over Sustainable Tuna Fisheries TO NMFS NOAA WCPFC United Nations 111710 From FV OCEAN JOY US Doc 554321 Captain John Harder co founder of Ocean Friends Against Driftnets OFAD Summary of 2010 North Pacific Albacore troll season Before setting out for fishing this season I John Harder tried to pass on to NMFS and the Coastal Commission that High Seas Driftnets are still fishing for albacore tuna in the North Pacific I have been reporting illegal driftnet activity for the past 10 years with pictures of gill net marked fish boat sightings on our international fishing grounds Trip 1 We left San Diego on the 26th of June for fishing On the 30th of June we landed our 1st of many gill net marked fish The fish were averaging 15 lbs These were well marked fish that would indicate targeted in 2009 picture marked A After moving north to the area of 45N X W approximately 70 miles off the coast of Oregon school fish averaging 1012 lbs started showing up with both heavy to light gill net markings on them pictures BG These gill net markings were fresh and indicate driftnet activity done earlier this year The fish were not old enough to be marked in years past They are only average 2 years old Many fish were scuffed up with broken fins tails We landed gill net marked fish every day We ended our trip on the 26th of July I tried notifying NMFS to arrange for an observer but to no avail I submitted my log information hoping that it would be addressed at the technical compliance comity for the WCPFC It was not brought forward Trip 2 We left Westport WA On the 30th of July for off shore Approximately 800 miles west of the coast in the area of 4730N X 14330W we started catching fish again These fish were sometimes heavily marked by High Seas driftnets We averaged 20 marked fish for the trip Many of the 12 lb fish had light scratches were barely visible to the untrained eye The schools of fish were not staying in the same location but migrating into the east towards the west coast We ended our trip into Westport WA on the 26th of August I submitted many pictures along with my log information hoping that it would be addressed at the technical compliance committee for the WCPFCIt was ignored Trip 3 We set out for offshore once again on the30th of August only to get stopped in the approximate area of 4730N X 139W for fishing The 1213 lb avg fish we were landing were relatively clean We had very few gill net marked fish and a more uniform size in the grade This was obviously a different run of fish moving east towards the coast We heard reports of a bigger run of fish being landed in the area of 4430N X 128W inside US EEZ with a major amount of fish having gill net markings on them The avg size of this fish was 12 lbs As I had suspected the fish from offshore on the previous trip had migrated into the coastal waters and was now spreading up down the west coast I talked with Canadian aircraft boarder patrol on the 9th of September Canadian Patrol was not aware of any driftnet vessels sighted previously this year Most of the driftnet marked fish landed this trip were in the 1517 lbs size We ended our trip on the 26th of September in Westport WA I sent pictures of gillnet marked fish along with my log information to NMFS hoping that it would be addressed at the technical compliance committee for the WCPFC Nothing was mentioned Trip 4 We left Westport on the 29th of September for fishing on the coast On October 3rd we landed driftnet marked fish in the area of 4230N X 12620W These fish avg 1517 lb We were only 70 miles off the coast of Northern California I am submitting 9 pictures with this letter log information to NMFS pictures 18 I understand that the technical compliance meeting has already taken place which does not seem appropriate unless people are trying hard to avoid this situation in which case is convenient I will be making this letter public bring it with me to the WCPFC in HA In Dec Conclusion Time time again we have proven with our US tagging programs for albacore tuna that stocks of albacore generally migrate east west across the North Pacific I personally have followed schools of fish starting in the area of 163E 153W along the 44N latitude in a matter of 12 days This is old news to High Seas troll fishermen such as me There have been reports of good fishing in early May June of this year by Japanese vessels If so they must have witnessed some High Seas driftnet activity in their area or they are driftnet vessels themselves How ells do these migrating fish get driftnet marks I ask gillnetters what is the reward for your gillnet tagged fish Where did you tag your gillnet fish Is this incomplete data going to continue Please stand be recognized We all must fish fairly Maybe I should be asking our US state department or Chicken of the Sea My fishery in International waters has been eliminated my coastal fishery is being depleted AGAIN The North South Pacific Albacore stocks should belong to sustainable hook line fisheries NOT driftnets Thanks for your time attention in this matter Regards John Harder Captainowner of FV Ocean Joy In Further consideration OFAD requests the commission to view WCPFCTCC72011OB04 to better understand that more stringent measures must be made and adopted to protect its natural recourses and sustainable fisheries As facts presented show the UN moratorium on high seas driftnets has not deterred the IUU driftnet fishery This other fishery continues to keep its market share driving the price of Albacore Tuna down and depleting the natural recourses along with WCPFCs sustainable tuna fishery In conclusion Revisiting the issue of The Law of the Sea Article 119 Conservation of the living resources of the high seas Part 3 States concerned shall ensure that conservation measures and their implementation do not discriminate in form or in fact against the fishermen of any State Further noting that the Wellington Convention seeks to prohibit driftnet fishing activities in its convention area OFAD feels that the WCPFCs CA should coincide with this ruling As it stands fishermen coming from states in the South Pacific such as New Zealand have more protection against high seas driftnets than fishermen coming from states in the North Pacific such as Canada This is clearly a form of discrimination and therefore should be amended and noted as such In closing OFAD thanks the Commission members of the WCPFC8 in considering these amendments and hopes that the proper attention will be given to these matters It hopes that WCPFC will project a positive report to the United Nations on the status of its sustainable fisheries in the future Regards to all OFAD president John Harder,high

WCPFC8-2011-OP03,3.0,ISSF POSITION STATEMENT Presented during the 8th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Guam 2630 March 2012 The International Seafood Sustainability Foundation ISSF is a global partnership among the tuna industry science and WWF the global conservation organization Our mission is to work toward the sciencebased conservation and management of tuna stocks and the protection of ocean health by supporting regional fisheries management organizations and advocating for the recommendations of each organizations scientific advisory body ISSF would like to thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission for the opportunity to present this position statement supporting decisive action based on the research compiled by the WCPFC Scientific Committee BACKGROUND Bigeye According to an updated assessment completed in 2011 and reported to the 7th Regular Session of the WCPFC Scientific Committee SC7 the fishing mortality for bigeye tuna is well in excess of the maximum sustainable yield MSY level average F 20062009 is about 41 higher than FMSY Analyses presented by SPC at SC7 indicate that CMM 200801 has been unable to limit the total amount of purse seine fishing effort as intended While the catch of bigeye has been reduced during the months of the FAD closure in CMM200801 it is evident that such a seasonal reduction is insufficient to stop overfishing of the stock in the near future given the overall annual level of fishing effort other fisheries need to be limited as well Projections made with alternative management scenarios presented by SPC at TCC7 indicate that closures of the entire purse seine fishery would have somewhat greater conservation benefits for bigeye although the catches of skipjack and yellowfin would be reduced Yellowfin and skipjack The populations of yellowfin and skipjack in the WCPO are not estimated to be in an overfished state nor are they being overfished However it should be noted that in the equatorial region where about 90 of the yellowfin catch is taken the stock may be fully exploited For this reason it is desirable to limit fishing mortality on yellowfin in the western equatorial region Furthermore the skipjack continues to experience high exploitation rates and several CCMs have expressed worry about possible range contractions if fishing mortality were to increase SC7 recommended that the Commission consider developing limits on fishing for skipjack to limit the declines in catch rate associated with further declines in biomass ACTION NEEDED WCPO Closures As stated above it is clear that a seasonal FAD closure is insufficient to reduce the fishing mortality of bigeye to FMSY or below in the short term The WCPFCs monitoring and observer programs including debriefing are not sufficiently developed to ensure that the FAD closure is fully respected Furthermore the many exemptions present in CMM200801 allow for a substantial amount of FAD fishing and fishing by gears other than purse seining contributes to overfishing Recognizing this ISSF urges the WCPFC to implement a complete closure of the purse seine fishery in lieu of a FAD closure1 As indicated above such a closure would have somewhat greater conservation benefits httpissfoundationorg20110115resolution1102wcpfcpurseseinetunacatches accrued to bigeye tuna and particularly if coordinated with similar closures in the IATTC convention area increased ease of monitoring and control of the measure At the same time the longline fishery for bigeye needs to continue to be capped Further ISSF urges individual participating States to collaborate with each other in order to plan for a voluntary complete purse seine closure that will reduce fishing mortality on bigeye tuna should the WCPFC fail to adopt such a meaningful bigeye conservation measure ISSF will revisit this issue at its next Board of Directors meeting following the 8th Regular Session of the WCPFC with a view to formulating and adopting its own scientific conservation measures necessary to ensure the conservation of the bigeye tuna resource in the WCPO Transshipments at Sea ISSF is concerned that if not properly monitored atsea transshipments can create a fertile environment for IUU fishing activities to go undetected For this reason ISSF has issued a conservation measure that calls upon processors traders importers transporters and others involved in the seafood industry to refrain from transactions with purse seine vessels that transship atsea including archipelagic waters and EEZs WCPFCs regulation of transshipment in the Convention Area allows for differences in the regulation of transshipments between archipelagic waters on the one hand and EEZs and the high seas on the other In the event that archipelagic waters of a WCPFC member are not covered by a comparable transshipment regulation ISSF urges States to take compatible measures to regulate monitor and report transshipments in those waters Vessel Registry and Capacity Limitation The first step towards managing capacity is to establish limited entry via a closed vessel registry after which reductions in the number of vessels can be negotiated In a fully exploited fishery coastal states rights to expand their participation in a tuna fishery must be accommodated by mechanisms for reducing the participation of others ISSF calls upon the WCPFC and member nations to develop a record of tuna fishing vessels with unique identifiers2 eg IMO numbers and to adopt a limited entry closed vessel registry with an eye towards ultimately reducing the number of fishing vessels to a level that is commensurate with the productivity of the WCPO fisheries To that end ISSF supports both Japans WCPFC7 proposal to limit further increases in purse seine capacity and the Kobe III call for a freeze in fishing capacity by developed fishing nations and creating mechanisms to transfer capacity to those developing countries with aspirations Continued Progress on Sharks ISSF recognizes the important joint efforts of the WCPFC Scientific Committee Secretariat and SPC to improve fishery statistics on sharks that would allow for their management by the Commission on a speciesbyspecies basis ISSF encourages CCMs to make this issue a priority ISSF strongly supports the SC7 recommendation to adopt mitigation measures for oceanic whitetip sharks in the Convention Area and blue sharks in the north Pacific In addition ISSF urges the Commission to mandate that fins remain naturally attached for any sharks retained onboard ISSF is also asking all RFMOs including the WCPFC to adopt a prohibition on deliberate purse seine setting around whale sharks Reference Points Though seven years have passed since the Convention entered into force the Commission has yet to adopt any reference points in accordance with Article 6 Despite some progress at the scientific level towards the study of potential reference points ISSF is disappointed with the lack of forward movement at the policy level highlighted by the TCC7s inability to recommend any action ISSF urges CCMs to give this matter a high

as well projections make with alternative management scenario present by spc at tcc7 indicate that closure of the entire purse seine fishery would have somewhat great conservation benefit for bigeye although the catch of skipjack and yellowfin would be reduce yellowfin and skipjack the population of yellowfin and skipjack in the wcpo be not estimate to be in an overfished state nor be they be overfishe however it should be note that in the equatorial region where about 90 of the yellowfin catch be take the stock may be fully exploit for this reason it be desirable to limit fishing mortality on yellowfin in the western equatorial region furthermore the skipjack continue to experience high exploitation rate and several ccms have express worry about possible range contraction if fishing mortality be to increase sc7 recommend that the commission consider develop limit on fish for skipjack to limit the decline in catch rate associate with further decline in biomass action

WCPFC8-2011-OP04,30.0,Species of concern Bigeye the scientific advice has not changed in several years Overfishing is occurring and the stock may be in an overfished state5 the new CMM should comply with both the advice from the seventh scientific Committee sC7 and article 30 of the convention so that overall fishing mortality is decreased by 39 percent from 2004 levels and a disproportionate burden of conservation action is not placed onto developing states Parties and territories and possessions6 Yellowfin Yellowfin should not experience increases in fishing effort especially in the western equatorial region where the spawning biomass is estimated to have declined to about 31 percent of the unexploited level7 Skipjack sC7 noted that future catch rates are likely to decline and catches will decrease as stocks are fished down to MsY levels8 It recommended that the Commission consider developing limits on skipjack fishing to slow declines in catch rates associated with diminishing biomass9 The primary shortfalls of CMM 200801 were the numerous exemptions the limited area of application and the failure to limit the overall effort on FADs when the ban was not in force The next generation CMM must address these shortfalls implement target and limit reference points and provide an enforceable framework for skipjack yellowfin and bigeye tuna conservation into the future I 6 POLICY stateMent based on the scientific advice and the requirements spelled out in the convention the Pew environment Group encourages WCPFC CCMs to address the following topics in the next generation CMM for tropical tunas1 AdoPT A NEW coMPREhENSivE ANd EffEcTivE coNSERvATioN ANd MANAgEMENT MEASuRE cMM foR TRoPicAl TuNAS11 Extend the FAD closure to end the overfishing of bigeye and put a limit on the number of FAD sets during the nonclosure period Previously the primary mechanism to reduce bigeye mortality in the purse seine fishery had been the FaD closure However increased FaD fishing in the nonclosure period offset the projected conservation gains of the closure10 WCPFC should extend the closure and limit the number of FaD sets in the nonclosure period to 2010 levels12 Maintain the management advice from CMM 200801 on longline fisheries and increase observer coverage to 100 percent on largescale freezer longline vessels and 20 percent on all other longline vessels a recent analysis of monitoring control and surveillance risks in the western and central Pacific notes unlike other parts of the world there is a strong case to be made that the majority of Iuu activity in the FFa region Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries agency is associated with licensed vessels11 Misreporting of target catch and bycatch is one of the most widespread compliance issues in the region and continues to undermine CMMs and the integrity of data provided to scientists to fully address these problems 100 percent of the longline fishing activity should be observed Pew recognizes that 100 percent observer coverage would be impossible to implement across the entire fleet in the near term However given the high impact that largescale freezer longliners have on target and associated and dependent species WCPFC should mandate 100 percent observer coverage on these vessels Pew also recommends that WCPFC increase coverage levels on all other longliners to at least 20 percent in accordance with the best available scientific advice12 WCPFC should also investigate the potential for the use of electronic monitoring ie require cameras and daily catch reporting through a vessel monitoring system or VMs until misreporting in the longline fishery is addressed CMMs will continue to fall short of their objectives scientists will have incomplete and inaccurate data for stock assessments and future potential benefits from maintaining sustainable stocks in the region will be undermined 13 Ensure that CCMs that benefit the most from bigeye fishing lead bigeye conservation efforts according to article 30 of the convention WCPFC must implement measures to ensure that a disproportionate burden of conservation action is not placed on developing states Parties and territories and possessions In short the WCPFC CCMs that benefit the most from bigeye fishing should lead conservation efforts see tables 1 and 2 I 7 POLICY stateMent Table 1 CCMs that benefit the

meeting in november 2011 it was informally proposed that a 250 charge per tonne of bigeye tuna caught by CCM longline fleets be charged as a conservation levy this is one possible solution as is the possibility of pricing vessel days at a higher rate when fishing on FaDs in recognition of the impact of that effort on juveniles ie one FaD fishing day may be charged as two fishing days regardless of the mechanism used the aim must be to minimize juvenile bigeye catch and not to undermanage the bigeye population or treat it as a secondary consideration both of which run counter to implementation of an ecosystembased approach14 Maintain and expand high seas pocket closures High seas pocket closures should be maintained at least until measures demonstrated to prevent and deter Iuu activity in those areas are in place and effectively implemented For these closures to be effective in reducing the catch of bigeye tuna overall fishing effort must be reduced instead of displaced and the closures should also apply to longline fisheries as they routinely transship at sea ccMs Economic Benefit from longline Activities in the WcPfc convention Area 200913 republic of Korea

vessel operators must be required to safely release entangled whale sharks It is estimated that about 60 whale sharks were killed by fishing nets in 2009 in WCPFC fisheries which is far too many for a species classified by the IUCN as Vulnerable to extinction Scientific studies have shown a nylon monofilament leader is actually a better gear option than a wire leader for reducing bycatch of sharks

WCPFC8-2011-OP05,14.0,mainly from the use of FADs3Not only is overfishing occurring but based on the average recruitment in recent years scientists are concluding that the bigeye tuna stock is also likely to be overfished and the spawning biomass is as low as 23 of its potential spawning level4 The SC meeting recognised that it is currently too early to quantitatively conclude whether CMM01 has reduced fishing mortality for bigeye tuna to the levels specified in the CMM Incomplete and insufficient data for 2009 and 2010 has also meant that fisheries models for 2010 are still uncertain and inconclusive5 However part of the problem is due to the range of exemptions that undermine its success Removal of these exemptions would remove about 50 of the estimated overfishing6 When reviewing CMM200801 and agreeing an enhanced new measure CMM2012 the TCC agreed to use the existing measure and its elements as the starting point SC7 did recommend additional measures to ensure further reductions in fishing mortality above those expected at the CMM2008017Greenpeace believes that many of the elements contained in the original CMM still apply and key elements should be retained updated and strengthened The current measure should remain in place unless the Commission agrees otherwise or there is an explicit cessation date Greenpeace recommends a 50 reduction in the catch rates of bigeye tuna from the recent average levels 20062009 to ensure that bigeye tuna stocks are given the best chance to recover to more precautionary levels It is vital that the newly agreed measures are considerably more effective and ambitious than the current 30 reduction that is contained in the CMM200801 in order to take into account poor catch reporting lack of independent observer data from longliners and uncertainties of the stock assessments Yellowfin The SC meeting concluded that WCPO yellowfin is not likely to be experiencing overfishing or in an overfished state according to current management objectives although there are significant uncertainties involved in the assessments Strong indications were provided however showing that this stock is in trouble8 Exploitation rates were the highest in the western equatorial region which accounts for more than three quarters of the total yellowfin catch and spawning biomass is estimated to have declined to less than a third of its unexploited levels Based on the Fmsy reference point currently used one model showed that there is a possibility that overfishing is occurring In addition New Zealand has reported a decline in catches which may indicate range contraction as the stock declines in size The high mortality rate of juvenile yellowfin primarily due to purse seine FAD fisheries is of particular concern with the SC

WCPFC8-2011-OP05,15.0,productivity of the stock would be significantly increased if juvenile catches were decreased9These indicators along with the uncertainty in stock assessments call for further reductions in yellowfin mortality to be included in the new CMM particularly with regard to juvenile yellowfin The importance of yellowfin fisheries to many coastal states underlines the urgent need for a precautionary approach in managing this stock Skipjack Skipjack catches in 2010 were the 2nd highest recorded While the stock is not described as being overfished there are concerns that if recent fishing patterns continue catch levels are likely to decline as stock levels are fished down to MSY levels Additionally high catches in the equatorial region could result in range contractions of the stock thus reducing skipjack availability to higher latitudes Japan Australia New Zealand and Hawaii have already reported catch declines10The precautionary approach must be applied in setting management targets to ensure these relatively abundant fish stocks and the economic viability of this fishery are not jeopardised It is therefore important that the new measure is applicable to skipjack tuna South Pacific Albacore Finally the albacore fishery also requires more protection and must also be covered by the CMM While this stock is considered relatively healthy without limits placed on this fishery there is a danger that fishing effort will be transferred from the more regulated stocks to albacore The fishery is particularly important to South Pacific nations and increases in catches will result in catch rate declines and associated impacts on vessel profitability11 Need for Greater Precaution Set Reference and Limit Points A precautionary and ecosystembased approach to fisheries management urgently requires the rejection of unsustainable fishing practices such as FADs in purse seine fisheries and the use of areabased management tools such as well enforced marine reserves Greenpeace strongly urges that a process is set swiftly into place to ensure that ecosystembased precautionary limit reference points and precautionary target reference points for all stocks as required by the UN Fish Stocks Agreement must be set by the WCPFC as well as management measures to ensure these targets are not exceeded and necessary actions can be taken swiftly if these targets are surpassed These reference points must take into account nontargetbycatch species and the ecosystem with priority made for species that are listed as threatened or endangered and also including economic and social objectives Cut Overcapacity Overcapacity is at the core of the everdeepening unsustainable exploitation of the regions tuna stocks This needs to be reversed so the Pacific will not be robbed of its opportunity to reap large economic benefits from the tuna resource and lose its edge in marketing these products under better environmental credentials The underlying issue to all

WCPFC8-2011-OP05,21.0,Ecological Benefits of Closures A significant increase in bigeye spawning mass appears when high seas areas pocket 3 4 and high seas area proposed under PNA agreement14 are closed to longlining in combination with closing off purse seine fishing and eliminating the effort from both pockets 3 4 and high seas areas as well as pockets 1 and 2 Therefore closing pockets 3 4 and the PNA proposed high seas area to longline fishing has a much greater beneficial effect than just purse seine closures and the effects are widespread throughout the region For example part of a known bigeye spawning area that begins in the Eastern Pacific Ocean lies within pockets 3 4 and the PNA proposed high seas area Longliners target sexually mature adult fish which is near the size of 50 mature female bigeye The combination of high levels of juvenile bycatch in purse seining with catch of adult female bigeye by longliners is having a detrimental impact of the bigeye stock throughout its life history15 The closure of pockets 3 4 as well as the other high seas area would also be effective for managing these fisheries as the climate warms In particular it would ameliorate the dramatic effect that the El NioSouthern Oscillation ENSO is having on the distribution of tropical tunas Warmer water that is preferred by skipjack tuna is being extended to the east during El Nio episodes This is resulting in high purse seine catches of skipjack and presumably high incidental catches of bigeye in the central region Closing all 4 pocketsand additional high seas area would ameliorate the effects of ENSO on the efficacy of the area closures as conservation measures and mitigate longterm variability by reducing catch of juveniles and protecting part of the spawning grounds whatever the ENSO phase If future changes projected under IPCC scenarios are correct that more frequent El Nio events will occur there will be a spatial shift of the core habitat of skipjack and bigeye tunas toward the central region16 The further potential benefits of the high seas closure to the fisheries management of the West and Central Pacific include protection of spawning areas potential increased yields through the export of larvae and spillover of fish help compliance and the control of IUU fishing provide insurance against fisheries collapse and the failure of other management measures ie providing a form of bet hedging for coping with uncertainty and lack of knowledge in order to reduce overall risk Much of the documentation of positive impacts of marine reserves on commercial fish species comes from studies relating to small area closures in coastal waters often in reef areas as most closures to date have been of this type These studies highlight that it takes a number of years for the reserves to yield positive effects especially in terms of increased yields in adjacent waters17A global metaanalysis demonstrates that globally old reserves are

WCPFC8-2011-OP05,22.0,reserves at increasing fish densities The results imply that reserves should be maintained for up to years following establishment even if they initially appear ineffective18 As the actual establishment of marine reserves and marine protected areas especially in the high seas and for highly migratory fish species is a relatively new endeavour there are few data but some models suggest positive benefits A recent modelling exercise demonstrates that fisheries benefits can be may be derived from reserves not just for overexploited stocks of lowmobility species but also to a lesser extent for underexploited stocks and highmobility species19i The researchers also note that greatly increased resilience to overfishing is also found in the majority of cases The authors conclude that a reserve provides benefits additional to those obtained from simple effort control However benefits from reserves depend to a major extent on the amount of effort redistribution following reserve establishment and on fishing selectivity hence these factors should be key components of any evaluation of reserve effectiveness Say No to FADs in Purse Seine Fisheries The use of fish aggregating devices FADs in purse seine tuna fisheries has major consequences for the sustainability of tuna fisheries as they increase the efficiency of purse seiners in a way that is difficult to control and measure they increase the catch of juvenile skipjack bigeye and yellowfin tunas and they result in bycatch of nontarget and vulnerable species such as sharks turtles and other fish species Of utmost concern is the shocking practice by some purse seine vessels that intentionally set their destructive nets on whales dolphins and whale sharks animals protected under numerous international agreements in order to get to the prized tuna Often these animals are killed in the process For example in 2009 it was estimated that there were 1323 toothed cetacean deaths and whale shark deaths due to encirclement by purse seine nets20Greenpeace strongly supports the proposal by Australia for an urgent new CMM that specifically bans purseseining on whale sharks and cetaceans and sets best practice guidelines for the release and reporting of these animals if accidentally caught In 2008 the WCPFC adopted measures within its CMM that restricted the use of FADs Evidence provided to the SC noted that while it was still early days to fully assess the impact of the FAD closure trends are encouraging As was illustrated again in 2010 the threemonth ban on the use of FADs was found to be effective in significantly reducing the catch of bigeye tuna compared to the other months of the year Overall total catch was below average during the FAD ban period in 2009 and 2010 Purse seine catch of bigeye tuna was significantly reduced21 during these closure periods compared to other months of those years However total purse seine effort increased between 2008 to 2010 with 2009 being a

WCPFC8-2011-OP05,23.0,preliminary results that FAD bans are effective for the time that they are in effect However if purse seine effort is increasing outside the threemonth FAD closure and exemptions still exist to the CMM any benefits accrued during the ban period are being offset in the rest of the months therefore rendering the short ban ineffective It is also difficult to get a full picture due to lack of relevant data as data was presented for the area 20N and 20S only and did not include the purse seine catches outside this area nor did it include catches from the Indonesian and Philippine fleets where catch of juvenile tuna is known to be particularly high Given the scientific recommendation for bigeye mortality reduction is a 39 reduction on 2004 levels22 it is clear that the WCPFC urgently needs to extend the FAD ban measure as an effective means of reducing the fishing mortality of bigeye and to allow the recovery of the stock to precautionary levels The SC made the conclusion that Limitation of FADs use would have a strong positive impact on bigeye stock conservation Greenpeace believes that the use of all objects that are deployed artificially as FADs or fishing on nonintentional FADs by purse seine fisheries should be banned globally by all the tuna RFMOs A total FAD ban in purse seine fisheries within the WCPO would clearly be the best means of reducing the bigeye purse seine catch as well as bycatch of threatened and endangered marine life such as sharks and to some extent turtles that are known to be attracted to FADs and get caught up in purse seine nets Overall the fishery is better off without FADs as the projections predict that total catch is quite stable and in fact increases slightly for increasing duration of FAD closure This is because of the higher yield per recruit that is achieved for all species resulting from the larger average size of tuna taken in unassociated sets compared to FAD sets 23 In addition recent studies demonstrate an overall economic benefit of reducing FAD use24 Enhanced Enforcement Key Role of NGOs Greenpeace commends efforts by the Commission to establish an enhanced compliance monitoring scheme CMS to ensure compliance with CMMs At WCPF7 a proposal put forward by Australia included the participation of NGOs in such a measure to provide information to the Commission on noncompliance by CCMs The Commission Chair reflecting on experience from various committees and governance bodies suggested that the benefits of allowing interested parties to make information available outweighed the drawbacks citing the effectiveness of this approach in development of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement The Commission asked Australia to continue to work intersessionally to identify a range of possible responses to noncompliance as provided in Para 23 of CMM 201003 and report to TCC7 Allowing NGOs to supply information for compliance purposes given the lack of surveillance capacity in the region would add to the Commissions efforts of ensuring compliance with CMMs Such practice is already formalised in other tuna RFMOs such as ICCAT Observers in particular environmental NGOs are playing an increasingly participatory role in the Commissions monitoring control and surveillance responsibilities particularly with regards to maritime surveillance of both the high seas managed areas and national waters A formal process for the submission and SC 7 recommended that there should be a minimum of a 32 reduction in fishing mortality from the average levels for 20062009 to return the fishing mortality rate to FMSY This is the equivalent to a minimum of a 39 reduction of the 2004 level in fishing mortality and a 28 reduction of the average 20012004See page 38 SC 2011 Summary Report

Harvest Strategies WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Develop strong sciencebased Harvest Strategies to be implemented simultaneously with the development of precautionary Reference Points and Harvest Control Rules High Seas Closures WWF recommends that the WCPFC should Develop a program to treat the HSPs as Special Management Zones SMZ subject to mutually agreed rules and measures contingent upon strict reporting and observation requirements by the WCPFC Consider a Vessel Days at Sea VDStype scheme specific to HSPs which would count against the overall effort of the CCM Rescind the waiver of the FAD closure on the domestic purse seine fisheries offered to CCMs displaced from the HSP closure areas upon transition of those areas to SMZs and Require all CCMs allowed to reenter the HSPs to implement complementary measures to the revised CMM 200801 enacted at WCPFC9 in addition to an equivalent compliance and monitoring scheme applicable to the domestic purse seine fisheries Tuna Species Bigeye Tuna WWF supports the SC8 recommendation for development of a revised CMM for BET YFT and SKJ tuna stocks Consistent with this recommendation the WCPFC must Adapt and adopt management measures that apply to all sectors of the fishery Further strengthen the control of FAD activities Build on the apparent success of some fleets in reducing their dependence on FADs to achieve greater control of FAD activity outside the closures including control of the number of FADs set throughout a year instead of FAD time closures Implement an absolute reduction of the total number of FAD sets to the levels no greater than those in the fishery in 2010 Clearly define limits on purse seine effort that are applicable in different areas Implement measures which reduce fishing mortality on BET from the longline fishery and Consider a complete closure of the purse seine fishery for a defined period of time during the highest catch or catch rates of juvenile BET including any mitigation measures necessary to address adverse socioeconomic impacts Yellowfin Tuna WWF recommends that the WCPFC take proactive and precautionary measures to prevent any further decline of the YFT stock and that WCPFC must Implement the SC7 recommendation to the WCPFC to limit YFT fishing mortality to its 20012004 level in the western equatorial region Pacific Bluefin Tuna WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Revise

Albacore Tuna WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Introduce effective capacity and effort controls for management of the South Pacific ALB stock and Encourage domestic fisheries managers to implement Tuna Management Plans that freeze licenses for ALB at current levels and seek to reduce that number to a level that achieves Maximum Economic Yield Bycatch Whale Sharks WWF recommends that the WCPFC should Acknowledge the SC8 conclusion that whale sharks meet the criteria for consideration as a key shark species and define whale sharks as a key shark species Adopt Australias Proposal to Address the Impact of Purse Seine Fishing Activity on Whale Sharks which includes a specific prohibition for setting purse seines on whale sharks Support procedures for the careful and safe release of whale sharks inadvertently captured in purse seines Recommend requirements for logbook and observer reporting of all interactions with whale sharks for submission to the flag State and to the WCPFC Encourage the development of reference points for nontarget species including whale sharks as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Oceanic Whitetip and Silky Sharks Based on the recommendations of the SC8 regarding oceanic whitetip and silky sharks the WCPFC must Endorse additional mitigation measures and maintain existing measures in an effort to improve the status of the WCPO oceanic whitetip and silky shark stocks including o prohibit the retention transhipment storage onboard sale and landing of oceanic whitetip and silky sharks in all fisheries managed by the WCPFC o mandate the prompt and careful release of any captured oceanic whitetip and silky sharks and o ensure that all interactions with oceanic whitetip and silky sharks are reported in terms of number and status of animals through logbooks and observer records Develop and implement reference points for nontarget species including oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks as envisaged under Articles 5

reference points for nontarget species as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPFC Convention Support and promote the collection of speciesspecific shark catch data in the WCPO through observer records and logbooks Implement a requirement for all sharks be landed whole with their fins naturally attached allowing for a partial cut method to facilitate safety and storage and Until such time a fins attached policy is enacted implement a prohibition on the transfer of any unattached shark fins at sea Turtles WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Formally acknowledge the deficiencies of CMM 200803 Adopt the sea turtle conservation and management measures proposed by WWF in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs Develop and implement CMM revisions aimed at o Strengthening key language and reducing the ambiguity in desired outcomes of the CMM thereby enabling not only stronger conservation measures but also better monitoring of CMM effectiveness WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 iv WWF POSITION o Committing explicitly to a goal of zero mortality of sea turtles and catch rates as close to zero as possible o Introducing new interim binding measures including mandatory adoption of bycatch reduction gear eg circle hooks and other mitigation techniques conducting research on mitigation techniques and reporting on sea turtle impacts with a goal of later implementing a consolidated optimal bycatch mitigation package o Setting an appropriate interim catch rate that would trigger moveon

surveillance requirements and Reconstitute efforts to clearly communicate the ecological and economic benefits of circle hook adoption and sea turtle mitigation techniques to CCMs and their fleets Seabirds WWF recommends that the WCPFC should Adopt the seabird conservation measures recommended by ACAP as the best practice for longline operations including the use of weighted branch lines night setting and bird scaring tori lines Endorse the use of 2 out of 3 of the seabird bycatch best practices on all longline vessels fishing south ofS and Consider implementation of the seabird bycatch best practices throughout the WCPFC CA where incidence of seabird interaction warrants mitigation measures Monitoring and Compliance Catch Documentation System As part of the CDS development WWF requests that the WCPFC consider certain key features of a good CDS system including A requirement for electronic documentation to accompany all catch harvested landed transhipped traded domestically exported processed imported and reexported Complementary measures to maximize the effectiveness of the CDS through o ensuring that transhipment at sea does not compromise the effectiveness of the CDS o adopting Port State Measures implemented simultaneously with the CDS and o adopting trade restriction measures against flag States with vessels on the IUU list Parameters that include all species of tunas billfish and sharks managed by the WCPFC A commitment to continuous improvement of the CDS by investigating the benefits and feasibility of verification systems such as electronic tagging and the use of biotechnology Establishment of a capacity development fund to provide a costsharing mechanism that enables progressive cost sharing among member states and Maximizing retailer and public access to data through modern electronic tools Regional Observer Programme With respect to the continued implementation and operation of the ROP the WCPFC must Implement a binding consistent and consolidated set of standards for the ROP Conduct a phased implementation of 100 observer coverage on all fishing and support vessels Revise the Observer Provider Code of Conduct to create more

of redundant duplicative or otherwise obsolete data fields and Develop a more comprehensive analysis and design plan for spatially and temporally representative observer coverage of each fishery operating in the WCPFC CA IUU Measures The WCPFC must maintain strong procedures for identifying listing and retaining IUU vessels on IUU Lists to ensure that the integrity of the WCPO fisheries including Ensuring the burden of proof must always remain with the IUU offender to explicitly prove through appropriate documentation WCPFC CMM 201006 paragraph 25 ae that all obligations have been met before being removed from an IUU list Maintaining the current definition of IUU fishing for the purpose of the IUU list and Ensuring that sanctions of adequate severity are always onerous enough to prevent deter and eliminate any future IUU conduct and not just a cost of doing business Data and Statistics WWF recommends that the WCPFC should Repeat the request for CCMs who have yet to provide operational level catch and effort data provide Data Improvement Plans to the WCPFC and Request that until operational catcheffort data are provided noncompliant CCMs must provide annual catch estimates by gear and species for waters of national jurisdiction and high seas areas separately as per the scientific data provision rules of the WCPFC Miscellaneous Cost Recovery and Optimization WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Oppose the implementation of a fee for observers to attend WCPFC meetings Conclusion WWF once again calls on the WCPFC to look carefully look at our collective conduct as nations with a responsibility for managing fishery resources in the WCPFC CA With respect to each of the agenda items addressed at the WCPFC9 Regular Meeting the commission delegates must genuinely consider whether previous actions have been responsible and commendable in achieving the overarching goal of fisheries sustainability in the WCPO The WCPFC shares the distinction as the youngest RFMO but is also regarded as arguably the most effective However we all must constantly guard against the complacency and greed that leads to poor decisionmaking resulting in the collapsing fish stocks in other regions Unfortunately with some stocks in the WCPO such as bigeye tuna and oceanic whitetip sharks we are treading dangerously down a path leading to trouble The WCPFC possesses the ability and opportunity to chart the course towards sustainable fishery resources especially tuna in the WCPO The WCPFC and its subsidiary bodies must continually promote and adopt strong and effective conservation and management action to maintain and rebuild tuna stocks implement appropriate monitoring and enforcement measures promote a viable tuna industry and support vibrant coastal

Regular Session of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 Conservation and Management Measures WWF applauds the recent efforts of managers to seek the development and implementation of effective science based Harvest Strategies Harvest Control Rules and Reference Points HSHCRRP Stock assessments used to estimate the amount of fish in a particular stock and the rate of fishing on that stock throughout the region has continually improved WWF encourages the WCPFC to urgently pursue the implementation of these management measures as a way to reduce the logistical burden on managers while streamlining the management process and in turn ensuring the sustainability of WCPO fisheries To assist this effort WWF has created a simplified explanation of these basic management measures for distribution at this meeting Reference Points The WCPFC must formally adopt explicit Limit and Target Reference Points LTRPs for all WCPO fishery stocks under its authority Implementation of these formally designated LTRPs represents an absolute priority for the sustainable management of the fishery resources in the WCPO Existing science supports the implementation of welldefined and precautionary biologicallybased Limit Reference Points and WWF generally supports the recommendations of the SC While Target Reference Points require additional consideration of socioeconomic considerations current understanding of the biological and socioeconomic conditions does not prevent the implementation of sufficiently precautionary interim Target Reference Points at this time While LTRPs are needed in all fisheries the WCPFC should prioritise the implementation of LTRPs in at least the four key tuna species including skipjack SKJ albacore ALB bigeye BET and yellowfin YFT at this time Very simply reference points provide management decisionmakers an objective tool to determine whether a fish stock size is becoming too small or fishing pressure is becoming too great WWF notes that the WCPFC has discussed and considered reference points since 2006 and that while the SC has made several recommendations to the WCPFC on appropriate reference points the WCPFC has failed to adopt formal explicit reference points Nonetheless while stock assessments conducted by SPC use BMSY and FMSY as Limit Reference Points and provide advice to the WCPFC more explicit reference points are justified based on the available scientific information At the recent SC8 meeting in Busan one CCM expressed a preference for fishing mortalitybased ie Fbased Limit Reference Points justified by the perception that 1 fishing mortality is a parameter that the WCPFC controls 2 they are more likely to be robust against changes in recruitment and 3 they require less information about the biological responses of tunas especially at lower biomass2 While this may be relevant to tunas in this region which have not been fished down to very low levels it fails to recognize inherent vulnerabilities to the application of such a measure despite perceived aboveaverage resilience and associated SPR values While simply managing to a default MSY as a natural Limit Reference Point may seem appealing because it results in a perceived optimum level of depletion it also results in a potential failure of the management system to respond in a timely and effective way An Fbased Limit Reference Point is indeed designed to control fishing capacity or in other words the rate at which the harvest influences the stock size However under the existing management regime managing solely under an F Smart Fishing Initiative POSITION Gregg Yan WWF WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION based model leaves too much room for delay in action and as a result fails to respond adequately to changes in stock size or fishing pressure For example there is typically two years between stock assessments in all WCPO fisheries In that two year time period assume that the fleet capacity either through size or efficiency expands substantially Due to the timing of the stock assessments and data availability for the meetings it could be three years or more before the WCPFC will be capable of addressing the unsustainably increased fishing mortality This dynamic can result in a severe overshoot of mortality resulting in the need for substantial painful retractions of effort and significant rebuilding measures While the uncertainties associated with biomass Bbased Limit Reference Points make them a less attractive option to some stakeholders they constitute a critical tool to ensure that stock sustainability is ensured Fbased Limit Reference Points are important and useful but not as critical as a Bbased limit because a Bbased limit ensures a biological floor that the fishery cannot go below In March 2012 WCPFC8 endorsed the hierarchical approach to identifying Limit Reference Points and tasked the Scientific Services Provider with preparing proposed Limit Reference Points for the consideration of SC8 As stated in WWFs Position Statement to WCPFC8 2012 WWF strongly urges the WCPFC to formally adopt Limit and Target Reference Points The adoption of explicitly determined Limit and Target Reference Points for at least the four key tuna species namely SKJ ALB YFT and BET is an absolute priority for the sustainable management of these resources in the WCPO WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Adopt precautionary Bbased Limit Reference Points3 preferably based on Spawning Biomass4 for all WCPO fishery stocks under its authority Adopt precautionary Fbased Limit Reference Points as an interim measure to attempt to control the exploitation rate5 Direct the SC to develop a range of alternatives for precautionary Target Reference Points for consideration in 2014 and Consider risk probability levels of breaching the Limit Reference Points of 10 or less as a precautionary measure Harvest Control Rules Under the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement Convention article 5c the precautionary approach6 became a basic element of sustainable fisheries management Globally countries and regional organizations have adopted the measure as a matter of domestic and international law supporting prudent fisheries management The measure was also specifically included in the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries serving as a guidepost for sustainable fisheries management Furthermore the measure appears prominently in the FAO Guidelines for ecolabelling and is a critical element for consideration in ecolabelling certification schemes such as the Marine Stewardship Council MSC It is possible to make the implementation of a precautionary approach operational through preagreed management actions or specifically Harvest Control Rules that trigger management actions when stock status indicators reach predefined Reference Points Currently no explicit Harvest Control Rules exist in the WCPFC The WCPFC currently bases management on implied reference points informed by basic catch and effort data lengthfrequency and tagging data Limited management actions include limiting fishing effort through various ad hoc input controls such as the PNAs Vessel Day Scheme VDS closure of high seas pockets FAD closures and implementation of capacity limits primarily driven by concerns for BET and YFT Therefore the absence of formally agreed Harvest Control Rules is necessary for the WCPFC to fully implement management best practices At its most basic a Harvest Control Rule is simply a preagreed action or set of actions to be taken by a management body that are designed to achieve a medium or longterm Target Reference Point while avoiding reaching a Limit Reference Point Simple Harvest Control Rules can be described as an if then statement An example of a very simple Harvest Control Rule would be if the fishery stock level falls below the target level then the level of fishing must be reduced by 20 Managers may also agree in advance what the specific management actions are to reach that 20 reduction in the level of fishing such as a regional closure or gear restriction Implementing Reference Points as part of Harvest Control Rules puts in place clear decision rules which minimize excessive debate and allow managers to act quickly and decisively when the fishery reaches a predefined threshold eg Limit or Target Reference Point Furthermore Harvest Control Rules lay the foundation for developing well defined fisheries management plans that are grounded in sound science WWFPANDAORGSMARTFISHING Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION The WCPFC must develop and implement Harvest Control Rules HCRs consisting of explicit preagreed actions designed to achieve a medium or longterm Target Reference Point and avoiding reaching a Limit Reference Point while explicitly defining intended responses to changes in stock status Welldefined HCRs must seek consistency with the Harvest Strategy and ensure that the exploitation rate is reduced as a Limit Reference Points are approached while also considering a wide range of uncertainties in their design WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Thoroughly review the SC8 recommendations for HCRs and the outcomes of the Management Objectives Workshop and Urgently pursue development and implementation of Harvest Control Rules for all stocks under its authority to be achieved by 2015 Harvest Strategies A Harvest Strategy represents the basic guidelines that stipulate how managers go about setting general harvest levels or allowable fishing levels The choice of Harvest Strategy affects the yield from the fishery and the risk of overfishing Efforts to define Reference Points and Harvest Control Rules help to clearly inform the Harvest Strategy The current rudimentary Harvest Strategy employed in the WCPFC does not contain any Harvest Control Rules and as such does not reflect best practice The WCPFC must develop welldefined Harvest Strategies or Policies based on distinct preagreed Reference Points and Harvest Control Rules The Harvest Strategies should reflect clear guidelines that stipulate how managers set general harvest levels or allowable fishing levels Any Harvest Strategy considered must contain strong precautionary directives to ensure that stock size stays above the Limit Reference Point and ideally a Target Reference Point set to achieve Maximum Economic Yield A welldeveloped Harvest Strategy should also consider details of a rebuilding plan should a stock go below the Limit Reference Point WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Develop strong sciencebased Harvest Strategies to be implemented simultaneously with the development of precautionary Reference Points and Harvest Control Rules High Seas Closures In general WWF supports the implementation of conservation and management measures where the science indicates those measures represent important contributors to tuna conservation and the health of the ecosystem they depend upon However at this time there is insufficient scientific evidence to indicate the High Seas Pocket HSP closures in the WCPO have effectively contributed to tuna conservation and management Furthermore contrary evidence suggests that effort is ultimately displaced from the HSP closure areas where bycatch rates tend to be lower and into the nearshore EEZ areas where bycatch tends to be higher WWF notes the very limited impact of the high seas closures on the overall management of tunas in the WCPO as evidenced by the overall failure of CMM 200801 despite good adherence to the HSP closure reported by the SC87 WWF agrees with the SC8 recommendation that closing areastime entirely to purse seine fishing without consideration of the fate of displaced fishing effort will not be effective for BET conservation and less profitable to purse seine operations as a whole8 The High Seas Pockets HSPs require a unique approach that is applicable to all Members Cooperating NonMembers and Participating Territories CCMs WWF recommends that the WCPFC should Develop a program to treat the HSPs as Special Management Zones SMZ subject to mutually agreed rules and measures contingent upon strict reporting and observation requirements by the WCPFC Consider a Vessel Days at Sea VDStype scheme specific to HSPs which would count against the overall effort of the CCM Rescind the waiver of the FAD closure on the domestic purse seine fisheries offered to CCMs displaced from the HSP closure areas upon transition of those areas to SMZs and Require all CCMs allowed to reenter the HSPs to implement complementary measures to the revised CMM 200801 enacted at WCPFC9 in addition to an equivalent compliance and monitoring scheme applicable to the domestic purse seine fisheries WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION Tuna Species Bigeye Tuna WCPFC8 previously adopted CMM 201101 to ensure that measures remain applicable for 2011 under CMM 200801 with several noted exemptions until 28 February 20139 Assisted by the SPC SC8 reviewed the effectiveness of CMM 201101 to reduce fishing mortality of bigeye tuna BET the effectiveness of CMM 200801 and provided scientific advice to the WCPFC for the development of a revised CMM for BET YFT and SKJ tuna stocks SPC also approximated the impact of the various exemptions contained within CMM 200801 estimating that if the CMM was implemented without exemptions approximately half of the overfishing that is estimated could occur under the CMM as written could be removed reduction of BET FFMSY from 135 to 11710 The SC8 maintains that the catch of small BET YFT and SKJ can be significantly reduced by purse seines switching from FAD sets to unassociated sets11 Nonetheless the SC8 specifically noted that CMM200801 has not reduced the fishing mortality for BET to the level intended and supports the need for additional or alternative targeted measures to reduce the fishing mortality on BET12 Since a reduction in fishing mortality on BET has not reached the intended level additional targeted measures to reduce the fishing mortality on BET must be considered for all gear types Indeed the FFA member states emphatically support the need for additional or alternative targeted measures to reduce the fishing mortality on BET13 In the event that these additional measures continue to fail to adequately address BET mortality the WCPFC must consider even stronger measures andor fewer exemptions to the rules If overfishing of BET continues to occur the WCPFC must consider more extreme measures including a complete periodic closure to all purse seine fishing with no or at least very minimal exemptions For the closure to be meaningful the WCPFC must impose the closure around the time of the greatest catchcatch rates of juvenile BET and over a length of time sufficient to bring BET mortality near the reference point While it may seem drastic another RFMO has previously successfully used a complete periodic closure to control BET mortality The IATTC successfully implemented a similar measure to control the BET mortality within a small percentage of the reference point used in their management thereby proving its efficacy in an analogous situation WWF acknowledges that this action could potentially ,commission ninth regular

discussionth regular session of the western central pacific fisheries commission wcpfc manila philippines 26 december 2012 conservation and management measures wwf applaud the recent effort of manager to seek the development and implementation of effective science base harvest strategies harvest control rules and reference points hshcrrp stock assessment use to estimate the amount of fish in a particular stock and the rate of fishing on that stock throughout the region have continually improve wwf encourage the wcpfc to urgently pursue the implementation of these management measure as a way to reduce the logistical burden on manager while streamline the management process and in turn ensure the sustainability of wcpo fishery to assist this effort wwf have create a simplify explanation of these basic management measure for distribution at this meeting reference point the wcpfc must formally adopt explicit limit and target reference point ltrp for all wcpo fishery stock under its authority implementation of these formally designate ltrp represent an absolute priority for the sustainable management of the fishery resource in the wcpo exist science support the implementation of welldefine and precautionary biologicallybase limit reference points and wwf generally support the recommendation of the sc while target reference point require additional consideration of socioeconomic consideration current understanding of the biological and socioeconomic condition do not prevent the implementation of sufficiently precautionary interim target reference point at this time while ltrp be need in all fishery the wcpfc should prioritise the implementation of ltrp in at least the four key tuna specie include skipjack skj albacore alb bigeye bet and yellowfin yft at this time very simply reference point provide management decisionmaker an objective tool to determine whether a fish stock size be become too small or fishing pressure be become too great wwf note that the wcpfc have discuss and consider reference point since 2006 and that while the sc have make several recommendation to the wcpfc on appropriate reference point the wcpfc have fail to adopt formal explicit reference point nonetheless while stock assessment conduct by spc use bmsy and fmsy as limit reference points and provide advice to the wcpfc more explicit reference point be justify base on the available scientific information at the recent sc8 meeting in busan one ccm express a preference for fishing mortalitybase ie fbased limit reference points justify by the perception that 1 fishing mortality be a parameter that the wcpfc control 2 they be more likely to be robust against change in recruitment and 3 they require less information about the biological response of tuna especially at low biomass2 while this may be relevant to tuna in this region which have not be fish down to very low level it fail to recognize inherent vulnerability to the application of such a measure despite perceive aboveaverage resilience and associate spr value while simply manage to a default msy as a natural limit reference point may seem appeal because it result in a perceive optimum level of depletion it also result in a potential failure of the management system to respond in a timely and effective way an fbased limit reference point be indeed design to control fishing capacity or in other word the rate at which the harvest influence the stock size however under the exist management regime manage solely under an f smart fishing initiative position gregg yan wwf wwf statement to the wcpfc 9th regular session manila philippines 26 december 2012 wwf position base model leave too much room for delay in action and as a result fail to respond adequately to change in stock size or fishing pressure for example there be typically two year between stock assessment in all wcpo fishery in that two year time period assume that the fleet capacity either through size or efficiency expand substantially due to the timing of the stock assessment and data availability for the meeting it could be three year or more before the wcpfc will be capable of address the unsustainably increase fishing mortality this dynamic can result in a severe overshoot of mortality result in the need for substantial painful retraction of effort and significant rebuilding measure while the uncertainty associate with biomass bbased limit reference point make they a less attractive option to some stakeholder they constitute a critical tool to ensure that stock sustainability be ensure fbased limit reference point be important and useful but not as critical as a bbased limit because a bbased limit ensure a biological floor that the fishery can not go below in march 2012 wcpfc8 endorse the hierarchical approach to identify limit reference point and task the scientific services provider with prepare propose limit reference points for the consideration of sc8 as state in wwfs position statement to wcpfc8 2012 wwf strongly urge the wcpfc to formally adopt limit and target reference point the adoption of explicitly determine limit and target reference point for at least the four key tuna specie namely skj alb yft and bet be an absolute priority for the sustainable management of these resource in the wcpo wwf recommend that the wcpfc must adopt precautionary bbased limit reference points3 preferably base on spawning biomass4 for all wcpo fishery stock under its authority adopt precautionary fbased limit reference point as an interim measure to attempt to control the exploitation rate5 direct the sc to develop a range of alternative for precautionary target reference points for consideration in 2014 and consider risk probability level of breach the limit reference point of 10 or less as a precautionary measure harvest control rules under the 1995 un fish stocks agreement convention article 5c the precautionary approach6 become a basic element of sustainable fishery management globally country and regional organization have adopt the measure as a matter of domestic and international law support prudent fishery management the measure be also specifically include in the fao code of conduct for responsible fishery serve as a guidepost for sustainable fishery management furthermore the measure appear prominently in the fao guidelines for ecolabelle and be a critical element for consideration in ecolabelle certification scheme such as the marine stewardship council msc it be possible to make the implementation of a precautionary approach operational through preagreed management action or specifically harvest control rules that trigger management action when stock status indicator reach predefine reference points currently no explicit harvest control rules exist in the wcpfc the wcpfc currently base management on imply reference point inform by basic catch and effort datum lengthfrequency and tag datum limited management action include limit fishing effort through various ad hoc input control such as the pnas vessel day scheme vds closure of high sea pocket fad closure and implementation of capacity limit primarily drive by concern for bet and yft therefore the absence of formally agree harvest control rules be necessary for the wcpfc to fully implement management good practice at its most basic a harvest control rule be simply a preagreed action or set of action to be take by a management body that be design to achieve a medium or longterm target reference point while avoid reach a limit reference point simple harvest control rules can be describe as an if then statement an example of a very simple harvest control rule would be if the fishery stock level fall below the target level then the level of fishing must be reduce by 20 manager may also agree in advance what the specific management action be to reach that 20 reduction in the level of fishing such as a regional closure or gear restriction implementing reference points as part of harvest control rules put in place clear decision rule which minimize excessive debate and allow manager to act quickly and decisively when the fishery reach a predefine threshold eg limit or target reference point furthermore harvest control rules lie the foundation for develop well define fishery management plan that be ground in sound science wwfpandaorgsmartfishing sample paper sample paper sample paper wwf statement to the wcpfc 9th regular session manila philippines 26 december 2012 wwf position the wcpfc must develop and implement

response to change in stock status welldefine hcr must seek consistency with the harvest strategy and ensure that the exploitation rate be reduce as a limit reference point be approach while also consider a wide range of uncertainty in their design wwf recommend that the wcpfc must thoroughly review the sc8 recommendation for hcr and the outcome of the management objectives workshop and urgently pursue development and implementation of harvest control rules for all stock under its authority to be achieve by 2015 harvest strategy a harvest strategy represent the basic guideline that stipulate how manager go about set general harvest level or allowable fishing level the choice of harvest strategy affect the yield from the fishery and the risk of overfishe effort to define reference points and harvest control rules help to clearly inform the harvest strategy the current rudimentary harvest strategy employ in the wcpfc do not contain any harvest control rules and as such do not reflect good practice the wcpfc must develop welldefine harvest strategies or policies base on distinct preagreed reference points and harvest control rule the harvest strategy should reflect clear guideline that stipulate how manager set general harvest level or allowable fishing level any harvest strategy consider must contain strong precautionary directive to ensure that stock size stay above the limit reference point and ideally a target reference point set to achieve maximum economic yield a welldevelope harvest strategy should also consider detail of a rebuilding plan should a stock go below the limit reference point wwf recommend that the wcpfc must develop strong sciencebase harvest strategy to be implement simultaneously with the development of precautionary reference points and harvest control rules high seas closures in general wwf support the implementation of conservation and management measure where the science indicate those measure represent important contributor to tuna conservation and the health of the ecosystem they depend upon however at this time there be insufficient scientific evidence to indicate the high seas pocket hsp closure in the wcpo have effectively contribute to tuna conservation and management furthermore contrary evidence suggest that effort be ultimately displace from the hsp closure area where bycatch rate tend to be low and into the nearshore eez area where bycatch tend to be high wwf note the very limited impact of the high sea closure on the overall management of tuna in the wcpo as evidence by the overall failure of cmm 200801 despite good adherence to the hsp closure report by the sc87 wwf agree with the sc8 recommendation that close areastime entirely to purse seine fishing without consideration of the fate of displace fishing effort will not be effective for bet conservation and less profitable to purse seine operation as a whole8 the high seas pockets hsp require a unique approach that be applicable to all member cooperate nonmembers and participating territories ccms wwf recommend that the wcpfc should develop a program to treat the hsp as special management zones smz subject to mutually agree rule and measure contingent upon strict reporting and observation requirement by the wcpfc consider a vessel day at sea vdstype scheme specific to hsp which would count against the overall effort of the ccm rescind the waiver of the fad closure on the domestic purse seine fishery offer to ccms displace from the hsp closure area upon transition of those area to smz and require all ccms allow to reenter the hsp to implement complementary measure to the revise cmm 200801 enact at wcpfc9 in addition to an equivalent compliance and monitor scheme applicable to the domestic purse seine fishery wwf statement to the wcpfc 9th regular session manila philippines 26 december 2012 wwf position tuna species bigeye tuna wcpfc8 previously adopt cmm 201101 to ensure that measure remain applicable for 2011 under cmm 200801 with several note exemption until 28 february 20139 assist by the spc sc8 review the effectiveness of cmm 201101 to reduce fishing mortality of bigeye tuna

reduction of bet ffmsy from 135 to 11710 the sc8 maintain that the catch of small bet yft and skj can be significantly reduce by purse seine switch from fad set to unassociated sets11 nonetheless the sc8 specifically note that cmm200801 have not reduce the fishing mortality for bet to the level intend and support the need for additional or alternative target measure to reduce the fishing mortality on bet12 since a reduction in fishing mortality on bet have not reach the intend level additional target measure to reduce the fishing mortality on bet must be consider for all gear type indeed the ffa member state emphatically support the need for additional or alternative target measure to reduce the fishing mortality on bet13 in the event that these additional measure continue to fail to adequately address bet mortality the wcpfc must consider even strong measure andor few exemption to the rule if overfishe of bet continue to occur the wcpfc must consider more extreme measure include a complete periodic closure to all purse seine fish with no or at least very minimal exemption for the closure to be meaningful the wcpfc must impose the closure around the time of the great catchcatch rate of juvenile bet and over a length of time sufficient to bring bet mortality near the reference point while it may seem drastic another rfmo have previously successfully use a complete periodic closure to control bet mortality the iattc successfully implement a similar measure to control the bet mortality within a small percentage of the reference point use in their management

responsibility as custodian of the worlds largest tuna fishery in an area covering 20 percent of the Earths surface The WCPFC aims to ensure the longterm conservation and sustainable use of the fish stocks in the western and central Pacific Ocean WCPO The Commission is also the Regional Fisheries Management Organization RFMO with the clearest mandate to protect sharks These responsibilities require strong conservation and management actions through joint commitments and compliance Unfortunately the Commissions Members Cooperating Nonmembers and Participating Territories CCMs collectively have failed to take the needed actions in recent meetings At the 8th Regular Session of the WCPFC WCPFC8 earlier this year CCMs were unable to reach consensus on conservation action for the tropical tuna fishery National positions and interests took precedence over difficult yet critical management decisions and stewardship of the worlds most valuable tuna fishery took a step back Further even with a mandate to protect sharks and with clear scientific evidence of the need for action on several species CCMs took meaningful action on only one shark species All WCPFC members share a responsibility to ensure that this does not happen again and to take clear action at WCPFC9 in December This years meeting is critical for the future of bigeye and Pacific bluefin tuna and many shark species in the WCPO Governments must come together to agree on conservation and management measures that end overfishing of bigeye tuna protect sharks and strengthen controls to ensure legal and

of bigEyE TuNA Although all CCMs play a critical role in ensuring the overall health of fisheries and the broader ecosystem there has been a clear lack of leadership in the WCPO on the issue of bigeye tuna conservation The longline fishery for this species is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and is closely linked with other ecosystem conservation considerations such as catches of turtles sharks and seabirds Overfishing of bigeye tuna continues and only a multipronged management measure can address the problem effectively To date WCPFC members have adopted actions such as fish aggregating device FAD closures and longline reductions that help decrease bigeye mortality In recent discussions at the 9th Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee TCC9 earlier this year many governments took the view that they have made a sufficient contribution and that further action must come from somewhere else However according to the Scientific Committee measures that reduce fishing mortality across a range of fish sizes eg fishing gear are likely to produce the best results1 This means that all WCPFC members must do more to reduce mortality if a new CMM is to end overfishing Given that the vast majority of bigeye tuna fishing mortality comes from purse seiners using FADs and from longline fisheries any new measure must focus on further reducing mortality from both of these gears Effective management can be achieved only by joint action based on strong scientific advice and a commitment to compliance 1 cATch fEWER juvENilE bigEyE by liMiTiNg fAd uSE To 2010 lEvElS FAD closures have been effective in reducing bigeye tuna catch during the closure period but unrestricted FAD use in the nonclosure period resulted in a record number of FAD sets in 20112 The th Session of the Scientific Committee SC8 recommended limiting FAD sets to 2010 levels to end overfishing of bigeye In practical terms this means capping the number of FAD sets in a given year to about 15000 according to the Secretariat of the Pacific Community SPC Certain CCMs such as Japan have already taken steps to reduce their numbers of FAD sets and it is time for other CCMs to follow Japans example and for the Commission to adopt a firm limit2 cATch fEWER AdulT bigEyE ANd MoRE AccuRATEly REPoRT loNgliNE cATch Until fewer bigeye tuna are caught and until misreporting in the longline fishery is addressed CMMs will continue to fall short of their objectives scientists will have incomplete and inaccurate data for stock assessments and potential benefits from maintaining sustainable stocks in the region will be undermined Longline vessels have the most to gain from bigeye conservation and stand to lose the most if bigeye populations decrease further SC8 recommends reductions in fishing mortality across all gears including longlines to end overfishing of bigeye A continuation of the advice in 200801 would achieve the required mortality reduction but misreporting of target catch remains a widespread compliance issue in the region and continues to undermine CMMs3 I 6 POLICY STATEMENT To fully address these problems 100 percent of the longline fishing activity in WCPFC fisheries should be observed However we recognize that 100 percent observer coverage is unrealistic in the near term Given the high impact that largescale freezer longliners have on target associated and dependent species the WCPFC should mandate 100 percent observer coverage on these vessels Pew also recommends that the WCPFC increase coverage levels on all other longliners to at least 20 percent in accordance with the best available scientific advice4 The WCPFC should also investigate the potential for use of electronic observer systems as an alternative to human observers Bigeye

broader ecosystem there has been a clear lack of leadership on the issue of bigeye conservation The bigeye tuna longline fishery is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and is closely linked with other ecosystem conservation issues such as catches of turtles sharks and seabirds According to Article 30 of its Convention the WCPFC must implement measures to ensure that a disproportionate burden of conservation action is not placed on developing States Parties and territories and possessions In short the WCPFC CCMs that benefit the most from bigeye fishing should lead conservation efforts However many of those CCMs have argued that further cuts by their longliners would be an unfair hardship According to economic statistics however the value of the catch from the top five bigeyecatching CCMs has increased by more than 17 percent since 2008 when the previous measure was adopted compared with a cumulative 38 percent decline in value for all other CCMs and cooperating non members CNM Within the WCPFC five CCMs gain most of the benefits from the bigeye longline fishery They receive 84 percent of the value or benefit from bigeye fishing These CCMs also have significant purse seine fleets that fish on FADs These CCMs should lead holistic conservation initiatives that limit FAD use and reduce longline effort in line with the spirit of the WCPFC and the letter of its

measures are fully implemented 4 iMPlEMENT A coMPliANcE REgiME WiTh cMMS Noncompliance with CMMs threatens fish populations and associated and dependent species as well as the very credibility of the WCPFC It also undermines the activities of those who play by the rules To ensure that CCMs are fully accountable for their fishing activities the WCPFC should agree to implement a comprehensive and transparent compliance regime that systematically reviews fishing activities and automatically imposes appropriate penalties on CCMs that violate conservation and management measures This process should be open and transparent to all WCPFC observers so that civil society can learn how all parties are carrying out their stewardship responsibilities for the Pacifics highly migratory species iMPlEMENT cATch liMiTS ANd iMPRovE MoNiToRiNg ANd TRANSPARENcy WCPFC CCMs have an opportunity this year to strengthen management across multiple fisheries by committing to critical articles of the WCPF Convention notably Article 5 on the principles and measures for conservation and management Article 6 on the application of the precautionary approach and Article 21 on transparency Specifically this can be accomplished by managing and monitoring the use of FADs setting target and limit reference points for tuna fisheries and improving transparency in management of fisheries in the North Pacific especially for Pacific bluefin tuna1 iMPRovE fAd MANAgEMENT CCM compliance with FAD management requirements has been extremely poor as noted in WCPFCTCC72011OB016 and the uncontrolled proliferation of FADs must be addressed as a matter of priority In addition to limiting FAD sets CCMs fishing with FADs should be required to submit management plans and information on FAD numbers deployed recovered lost so that the Scientific Committee has better information on extent of use potential ecosystem impacts associated with the uncontrolled proliferation and marine debris data Moreover the use of FADs may give fishing operators access to fishing areas beyond their license including EEZs where they are not authorized to fish In this context FADs could enable a form of IUU fishing and it is therefore critical to develop MCS tools to regulate and control them FAD management requirements should be clearly stipulated in line with the recent International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN resolution 31 WCC2012Res031EN on tuna management The motion urged RFMOs and IUCN State and government agency Members with vessels fishing on drifting FADs to take the following actions on FAD management I 9 POLICY STATEMENT a Develop and submit to their respective RFMOs FAD management plans that are standard across fleets and regions so that RFMO scientific

Article 6 of the WCPFC Convention states In applying the precautionary approach the members of the Commission shall a apply the guidelines set out in Annex II of the Agreementand determine on the basis of the best scientific information available stockspecific reference points and the action to be taken if they are exceeded The 2012 Management Objectives Workshop was a first step to implementing this critical requirement WCPFC CCMs should adopt interim target and limit reference points building off the outcomes of the Management Objectives Workshop various papers presented at SC8 and Working Paper WCPFCTCC7201101 Further discussion on reference points and harvest control rules should continue to ensure that limit reference points have a low chance of being exceeded and that targets achieve the desired outcomes 21 Implement sciencebased catch limits for Pacific bluefin tuna The Pacific bluefin tuna fishery is now the worlds largest with the majority of the catch taken in WCPFC waters However management has not kept up with the growth of the fishery overfishing is occurring and preliminary results from the 2012 assessment indicate the continued decline of the species7 The Northern Committee should convene in Manila to review the results of the latest stock assessment and adopt sciencebased catch limits for implementation in 2013 This is a critical starting point for the process of setting target and limit reference points for Pacific bluefin The WCPFC should also implement measures to reduce juvenile catch as recommended by the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC by adopting a minimum size of 30 kg with a 40 percent tolerance for undersized fish Pacific Bluefin Richard Hermann I 103 iNcREASE ThE TRANSPARENcy of ThE iSc SciENTific PRocESS The WCPFC relies on the ISC to provide scientific stock assessments for the species managed by the Northern Committee including Pacific bluefin tuna This year however the ISC failed to complete the bluefin assessment in a timely manner leaving the Northern Committee without the critical scientific information needed to recommend effective catch limits and complementary management measures The ISC also lacks transparency in its process refusing to admit nongovernmental observers to meetings and declining to share its assessment reports Its failure to release its stock assessment documents and reports also poses problems for the Scientific Committee as was the case with the North Pacific striped marlin assessment this year These actions are not consistent with the high standards under which the WCPFC operates It should consider other more transparent arrangements such as working with the SPC to assess northern stocks going forward AdoPT coNSERvATioN ANd MANAgEMENT MEASuRES To PRoTEcT ShARkS Sharks are among the oceans most vulnerable animals According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 143 shark species are threatened or near threatened with extinction Even though the WCPFC is the most modern of the tuna RFMOs and has the clearest mandate to protect species within its jurisdiction it has taken meaningful action on only one shark species The WCPFC must act to ensure that targeted fishing and bycatch do not deplete shark populations and drive them to extinction1 PRohibiT ThE RETENTioN of Silky ANd hAMMERhEAd ShARkS The 2012 stock assessments for silky sharks Carcharhinus falciformis show that they are overfished and that overfishing is occurring in the WCPO8 9 Although the Scientific Committee determined that management advice could not be provided because of concerns about data and biases in the assessment it did note that some basic fisheries indicators are showing declines in recent years It also recommended mitigation measures to reduce the impact of nontarget fisheries on this species10 Because the best available science shows that silky sharks are overfished and that overfishing is occurring retention of silky sharks should be prohibited while efforts are made to improve the stock assessment Scalloped Sphyrna lewini smooth Sphyrna zygaena and great Sphyrna mokarran hammerhead sharks are species of significant global concern and have recently been proposed for inclusion on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES These species of hammerheads along with the winghead shark Eusphyra blochii are among the 13 Key Shark Species identified by the WCPFC Unfortunately no resources are assigned to these species under the Shark Research Plan SRP and no assessments are planned Although little is known about the status of hammerhead populations in the WCPO an assessment off the east coast of Australia found that catch rates of hammerheads have decreased by more than 85 percent over 44 years11 Because of significant concerns about the status of hammerhead populations and because no scientific assessment or advice is expected in the near future the WCPFC should prohibit the retaining on board transshipping storing and landing of hammerhead sharks POLICY STATEMENT I 11 POLICY STATEMENT2 PRohibiT PuRSE SEiNE vESSElS fRoM iNTENTioNAlly SETTiNg NETS ARouNd WhAlE ShARkS The practice of setting purse seines on whale sharks Rhincodon typus in the WCPO is a significant concern The observed interaction and mortality rates imply that total whale shark mortalities in the purse seine fishery were approximately 56 animals in 2009 and 19 animals in 201012 Mortality occurs in approximately one in every 10 sets involving a whale shark interaction13 To protect these slowmoving vulnerable sharks the WCPFC should prohibit purse seine vessels from intentionally setting nets around whale sharks in the convention area Further because whale sharks rarely escape unassisted before the net is closed vessel operators must be required to safely release entangled whale sharks The Pew Environment Group supports the SC8 recommendation that the whale shark be defined as a Key Shark Species of the WCPFC Although this designation and an eventual stock assessment would be a useful endeavor immediate action is needed to reduce whale shark mortality and we urge the WCPFC to prohibit the intentional setting of purse seine nets on whale sharks Whale shark Olivier RouxMarine Photobank I 123 MANdATE ThE uSE of ShARk bycATch MiTigATioN METhodS Shark bycatch in WCPFC fisheries is detrimental to the survival of many populations of these animals Their life history characteristics make them extremely susceptible to fishing pressure and the recovery potential for depleted shark species is significantly lower than that of other fish species Bycatch of oceanic whitetip Carcharhinus longimanus and silky sharks is of special concern considering the recent assessments showing that the populations are overfished and that overfishing is occurring The status of blue sharks is also a matter of concern Pew supports SC8s recommendation that bycatch mitigation measures be put in place Many longline vessels use wire leaders also known as steel traces to secure their catch on lines Shark bycatch is higher on longlines that use wire leaders because sharks are unable to break through the wire to escape Thus the use of wire leaders creates a de facto targeted but unregulated shark fishery Prohibiting wire leaders is a clear solution for reducing shark bycatch in longline fisheries In addition the use of monofilament can actually increase the catch of some target species such as tuna and swordfish14 15 For example research undertaken off the northeast Australian coast showed that monofilament leaders catch more target species with a statistically increased catch of bigeye tuna thereby increasing earnings per trip while wire leaders catch more sharks The study showed a clear financial incentive for fishers to use nylon leaders The longliners deploying only nylon leaders made approximately US8000 more per year than did longliners fishing with wire leaders16 Sharks that are brought next to the vessel alive when the fishing gear is retrieved can easily be freed with the use of line cutters Thus a prohibition on wire leaders would also facilitate compliance with the WCPFCs CMM 201007 paragraph 10 which says that CCMs shall take measures to encourage the release of live sharks that are caught incidentally and are not used for food or other purposes Gear modifications such as the use of single monofilament nylon leaders should be mandated so that fewer sharks are caught as bycatch in WCPFC tuna fisheries 4 PRohibiT ThE REMovAl of ShARk fiNS AT SEA To iMPRovE ENfoRcEMENT of ThE ShARk fiNNiNg bAN The WCPFCs ban on shark finningthe

for Pacific oceanic fisheries concluded that the majority of IUU activity in the region is associated with licensed vessels The project identified inadequate reporting as an area of concern and underlined the need to strengthen catch monitoring and validation throughout the supply chain17 In this context port State measures PSMs have proved to be effective at preventing the entry of illegal fish into the market and in removing the economic incentive for IUU fishing operators to continue with their activities The United Nations General Assembly has urged States to ratify the Food and Agriculture Organizations Port State Measures Agreement PSMA of 2009 cooperate through RFMOs and adopt all necessary port State measures18 In addition States at Rio20 agreed to expedite national processes to ratify the PSMA and implement measures that identify vessels engaged in IUU fishing19 The WCPFCs Performance Review Report recommended that in considering Port State Measures the Commission should take into account minimum standards in the PSMA measures and practices of other RFMOs in implementing such standards and developments in the broader system of Port controls20 Analysis conducted by the Pew Environment Group comparing the PSMs in the WCPFC with those established by the PSMA revealed a number of gaps in the WCPFCs PSMs such as no comprehensive inspection scheme no requirement for vessels to provide information before entering ports and no prohibition of port entry to IUU vessels21 The Pew Environment Group is aware that a number of WCPFC CCMs will need time to fully implement the provisions of the PSMA However the WCPFC should initiate constructive action toward the development of stronger control measures by gradually adopting enhanced PSMs In this context the European Unions proposal discussed at TCC8 for a CMM to establish a WCPFC scheme for minimum standards for inspection in port offers a good basis for progress that would complement the MCS minimum standards already applicable in the region In addition the proposal recognizes the needs and requirements of Small Island developing states and territories Providing support to developing States to effectively implement PSMs will be crucial to the effectiveness of a new regional port inspection scheme Any efforts in this direction should take into account existing

system as an alternative to human observer bigeye tuna and fad m ushioda seapics policy statement leadership is needed on bigeye tuna conservation efforts although all ccms play a critical role in ensure the overall health of fishery and the broad ecosystem there have be a clear lack of leadership on the issue of bigeye conservation the bigeye tuna longline fishery be worth hundred of million of dollar and be closely link with other ecosystem conservation issue such as catch of turtle shark and seabird accord to article 30 of its convention the wcpfc must implement measure to ensure that a disproportionate burden of conservation action be not place on develop states parties and territory and possession in short the wcpfc ccms that benefit the most from bigeye fishing should lead conservation effort however many of those ccms have argue that further cut by their longliner would be an unfair hardship accord to economic statistic however the value of the catch from the top five bigeyecatche ccms have increase by more than 17 percent since 2008 when the previous measure be adopt compare with a cumulative 38 percent decline in value for all other ccms and cooperate non member cnm within the wcpfc five ccm gain most of the benefit from the bigeye longline fishery they receive 84 percent of the value or benefit from bigeye fishing these ccms also have significant purse seine

unreported iuu activity in those area which be complementary to inzone measure be implement effectively open the pocket without those measure would weaken monitor control and surveillance mcs and increase the region vulnerability to iuu activity the closure should also be expand to cover longline fishery until strengthen transshipment measure be fully implement 4 implement a compliance regime with cmms noncompliance with cmm threaten fish population and associate and dependent specie as well as the very credibility of the wcpfc it also undermine the activity of those who play by the rule to ensure that ccm be fully accountable for their fishing activity the wcpfc should agree to implement a comprehensive and transparent compliance regime that systematically review fishing activity and automatically impose appropriate penalty on ccms that violate conservation and management measure this process should be open and transparent to all wcpfc observer so that civil society can learn how all party be carry out their stewardship responsibility for the pacifics highly migratory specie implement catch limits and improve monitoring and transparency wcpfc ccm have an opportunity this year to strengthen management across multiple fishery by commit to critical article of the wcpf convention notably article 5 on the principle and measure for conservation and management article 6 on the application of the precautionary approach and article 21 on transparency specifically this can be accomplish by manage and monitor the use of fad set target and limit reference point for tuna fishery and improve transparency in management of fishery in the north pacific especially for pacific bluefin tuna1 improve fad management ccm compliance with fad management requirement have be extremely poor as note in wcpfctcc72011ob016 and the uncontrolled proliferation of fad must be address as a matter of priority in addition to limit fad set ccms fishing with fad should be require to submit management plan and information on fad number deploy recover lose so that the scientific committee have well information on extent of use potential ecosystem impact associate with the uncontrolled proliferation and marine debris datum moreover the use of fad may give fishing operator access to fishing area beyond their license include eez where they be not authorize to fish in this context fad could enable a form of iuu fishing and it be therefore critical to develop mcs tool to regulate and control they fad management requirement should be clearly stipulate in line with the recent international union for conservation of nature iucn resolution 31 wcc2012res031en on tuna management the motion urge rfmo and iucn state and government agency member with vessel fish on drift fad to take the follow action on fad management i 9 policy statement a develop and submit to their respective rfmo fad management plan that be standard across fleet and region so that rfmo scientific

scientific trial to determine how to reduce catch of nontarget specie when fish on drift fads2 establish target and limit reference point for all wcpfcmanaged tuna species article 6 of the wcpfc convention state in apply the precautionary approach the member of the commission shall a apply the guideline set out in annex ii of the agreementand determine on the basis of the good scientific information available stockspecific reference point and the action to be take if they be exceed the 2012 management objectives workshop be a first step to implement this critical requirement wcpfc ccms should adopt interim target and limit reference point build off the outcome of the management objectives workshop various paper present at sc8 and working paper wcpfctcc7201101 further discussion on reference point and harvest control rule should continue to ensure that limit reference point have a low chance of be exceed and that target achieve the desire outcome 21 implement sciencebase catch limit for pacific bluefin tuna the pacific bluefin tuna fishery be now the world large with the majority of the catch take in wcpfc water however management have not keep up with the growth of the fishery overfishing be occur and preliminary result from the 2012 assessment indicate the continue decline of the species7 the northern committee should convene in manila to review the result of the late stock assessment and adopt sciencebase catch limit for implementation in 2013 this be a critical starting point for the process of set target and limit reference point for pacific bluefin the wcpfc should also implement measure to reduce juvenile catch as recommend by the international scientific committee for tuna and tunalike species in the north pacific ocean isc by adopt a minimum size of 30 kg with a 40 percent tolerance for undersized fish pacific bluefin richard hermann i 103 increase the transparency of the isc scientific process the wcpfc rely on the isc to provide scientific stock assessment for the specie manage by the northern committee include pacific bluefin tuna this year however the isc fail to complete the bluefin assessment in a timely manner leave the northern committee without the critical scientific information need to recommend effective catch limit and complementary management measure the isc also lack transparency in its process refuse to admit nongovernmental observer to meeting and decline to share its assessment report its failure to release its stock assessment document and report also pose problem for the scientific committee as be the case with the north pacific stripe marlin assessment this year these action be not consistent with the high standard under which the wcpfc operate it should consider other more transparent arrangement such as work with the spc to assess northern stock go forward adopt conservation and management measures to protect sharks sharks be among the ocean most vulnerable animal accord to the iucn red list of threatened species 143 shark specie be threaten or near threaten with extinction even though the wcpfc be the most modern of the tuna rfmo and have the clear mandate to protect specie within its jurisdiction it have take meaningful action on only one shark specie the wcpfc must act to ensure that target fishing and bycatch do not deplete shark population and drive they to extinction1 prohibit the retention of silky and hammerhead sharks the 2012 stock assessment for silky shark carcharhinus falciformis show that they be overfished and that overfishing be occur in the wcpo8 9 although the scientific committee determine that management advice could not be provide because of concern about datum and bias in the assessment it do note that some basic fishery indicator be show decline in recent year it also recommend mitigation measure to reduce the impact of nontarget fishery on this species10 because the good available science show that silky shark be overfished and that overfishing be occur retention of silky shark should be prohibit while effort be make to improve the stock assessment scallop sphyrna lewini smooth sphyrna zygaena and great sphyrna mokarran hammerhead shark be specie of significant global concern and have recently be propose for inclusion on appendix ii of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cite these specie of hammerhead along with the winghead shark eusphyra blochii be among the 13 key shark species identify by the wcpfc unfortunately no resource be assign to these specie under the shark research plan srp and no assessment be plan although little be know about the status of hammerhead population in the wcpo an assessment off the east coast of australia find that catch rate of hammerhead have decrease by more than 85 percent over 44 years11 because of significant concern about the status of hammerhead population and because no scientific assessment or advice be expect in the near future the wcpfc should prohibit the retaining on board transshipping store and landing of hammerhead shark policy statement i 11 policy statement2 prohibit purse seine vessels from intentionally setting nets around whale sharks the practice of set purse seine on whale shark rhincodon typus in the wcpo be a significant concern the observe interaction and mortality rate imply that total whale shark mortality in the purse seine fishery be approximately 56 animal in 2009 and 19 animal in 201012 mortality occur in approximately one in every 10 set involve a whale shark interaction13 to protect these slowmove vulnerable shark the wcpfc should prohibit purse seine vessel from intentionally set net around whale shark in the convention area far because whale shark rarely escape unassisted before the net be closed vessel operator must be require to safely release entangled whale shark the pew environment group support the sc8 recommendation that the whale shark be define as a key shark species of the wcpfc although this designation and an eventual stock assessment would be a useful endeavor immediate action be need to reduce whale shark mortality and we urge the wcpfc to prohibit the intentional setting of purse seine net on whale shark whale shark olivier rouxmarine photobank i 123 mandate the use of shark bycatch mitigation methods shark bycatch in wcpfc fishery be detrimental to the survival of many population of these animal their life history characteristic make they extremely susceptible to fishing pressure and the recovery potential for deplete shark specie be significantly low than that of other fish specie bycatch of oceanic whitetip carcharhinus longimanu and silky shark be of special concern consider the recent assessment show that the population be overfished and that overfishing be occur the status of blue shark be also a matter of concern pew support sc8s recommendation that bycatch mitigation measure be put in place many longline vessel use wire leader also know as steel trace to secure their catch on line shark bycatch be high on longline that use wire leader because shark be unable to break through the wire to escape thus the use of wire leader create a de facto targeted but unregulated shark fishery prohibiting wire leader be a clear solution for reduce shark bycatch in longline fishery in addition the use of monofilament can actually increase the catch of some target specie such as tuna and swordfish14 15 for example research undertake off the northeast australian coast show that monofilament leader catch more target specie with a statistically increase catch of bigeye tuna thereby increase earning per trip while wire leader catch more shark the study show a clear financial incentive for fisher to use nylon leader the longliner deploy only nylon leader make approximately us8000 more per year than do longliner fish with wire leaders16 sharks that be bring next to the vessel alive when the fishing gear be retrieve can easily be free with the use of line cutter thus a prohibition on wire leader would also facilitate compliance with the wcpfc cmm 201007 paragraph 10 which say that ccms shall take measure to encourage the release of live shark that be catch incidentally and be not use for food or other purpose gear modification such as the use of single monofilament nylon leader should be mandate so that few shark be catch as bycatch in wcpfc tuna fishery 4 prohibit the removal of shark fins at sea to improve enforcement of the shark finning ban the wcpfcs ban on shark finningthe wasteful practice of slice off a shark fin and discard the body at seacontain loophole that hamper enforcement the ban can be strengthen by prohibit the removal of shark fin at sea which would also facilitate collection of speciesspecific catch datum and help ensure compliance with exist wcpfc conservation and management measure for shark strengthen controls against illegal unreported and unregulated iuu fishing iuu fishing continue to be a serious concern in the wcpfc area where the practice exacerbate overfishe undermine conservation measure and threaten food security for coastal community policy statement i 131 improve port state measures to deter iuu fishing activity a 2009 project to develop a regional monitoring control and surveillance strategy for pacific oceanic fishery conclude that the majority of iuu activity in the region be associate with licensed vessel the project identify inadequate reporting as an area of concern and underline the need to strengthen catch monitoring and validation throughout the supply chain17 in this context port state measure psm have prove to be effective at prevent the entry of illegal fish into the market and in remove the economic incentive for iuu fishing operator to continue with their activity the united nations general assembly have urge states to ratify the food and agriculture organizations port state measures agreement psma of 2009 cooperate through rfmo and adopt all necessary port state measures18 in addition states at rio20 agree to expedite national process to ratify the psma and implement measure that identify vessel engage in iuu fishing19 the wcpfc performance review report recommend that in consider port state measures the commission should take into account minimum standard in the psma measure and practice of other rfmo in implement such standard and development in the broad system of port controls20 analysis conduct by the pew environment group compare the psm in the wcpfc with those establish by the psma reveal a number of gap in the wcpfcs psm such as no comprehensive inspection scheme no requirement for vessel to provide information before enter port and no prohibition of port entry to iuu vessels21 the pew environment group be aware that a number of wcpfc ccms will need time to fully implement the provision of the psma however the wcpfc should initiate constructive action toward the development of strong control measure by gradually adopt enhance psm in this context the european unions proposal discuss at tcc8 for a cmm to establish a wcpfc scheme for minimum standard for inspection in port offer a good basis for progress that would complement the mcs minimum standard already applicable in the region in addition the proposal recognize the need and requirement of small island develop state and territory provide support to develop states to effectively implement psm will be crucial to the effectiveness of a new regional port inspection scheme any effort in this direction should take into account exist initiative in the region such as the acp fish ii programme23 policy statement micronesia adam baske pew i 142 require imo numbers for vessels of 100 gross tonnes or more or 24

WCPFC9-2012-OP06,2.0,ISSF POSITION STATEMENT Presented during the 9th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission in Manila Philippines 7 December 2012 The International Seafood Sustainability Foundation ISSF is a global partnership among the tuna industry science and WWF the global conservation organization Our mission is to work toward the sciencebased conservation and management of tuna stocks and the protection of ocean health by supporting regional fisheries management organizations and advocating for the recommendations of each organizations scientific advisory body The first part of our statement addresses three of the most important issues facing global tuna sustainability reference points and harvest control rules fleet capacity and the management of FADs The second part addresses challenges specific to the WCPFC GLOBAL ISSUES Harvest Control Rules HCRs and Reference Points HCRs are a set of welldefined management actions to be taken in response to changes in stock status with respect to target and limit reference points Unless there is a preagreed upon action plan for avoiding overfishing or for rebuilding an overfished stock long negotiations lead to delayed action or inaction This delay can lead to further damage to the stock requiring even more aggressive curtailing of fishing The adoption of HCRs is a key aspect of modern fisheries management and is also a requirement of several ecolabel certification programs ISSF endorses the application of the Precautionary Approach using clear target and limit reference points and HCRs as called for by the UN Fish Stocks Agreement and by some RFMO Conventions While most tuna RFMOs have at least begun consideration of limit reference points through their science committees none have fully implemented these measures ISSF urges all tuna RFMOs to adopt stockspecific limit and target reference points and HCRs This is one of the most important actions that RFMO members can take to ensure the longterm sustainability of tuna stocks Though seven years have passed since the Convention entered into force the WCPFC has yet to adopt any reference points in accordance with Article 6 ISSF supports the adoption of the stockspecific limit reference points recommended by SC8 and looks forward to substantial progress on target reference points and HCRs at the upcoming Management Objectives Workshop ISSF urges CCMs to give this matter the highest priority at WCPFC9 Closed Vessel Registries and Management of Fleet Capacity Experts agree that there is overcapacity in the global tuna fleets Fishing fleet overcapacity increases pressure to weaken management measures and eventually leads to stock overexploitation The first step towards managing capacity is to establish limited entry via a comprehensive closed vessel registry with an eye towards ultimately reducing the number of fishing vessels to an appropriate level The IATTC is the only tuna RFMO with a closed vessel registry although current capacity is well in excess of resource productivity,issf position statement present during the 9th regular session of the western and central

WCPFC9-2012-OP06,3.0,ISSF supports the Kobe III call for a freeze in purse seine fishing capacity by developed fishing nations and creating mechanisms to transfer capacity to developing countries with aspirations to participate in these fisheries These steps should be taken now since scaling back fleet capacity will become even more difficult as new vessels are introduced To this end ISSF urges the following actions ICCAT IOTC and WCPFC adopt closed vessel registries especially for purse seine fleets All tuna RFMOs develop capacity transfer mechanisms to allow for increased participation by developing countries without an increase in overall capacity while ensuring effective monitoring and control of the fisheries All tuna RFMOs establish rules for monitoring and managing the movement of fishing capacity among the respective Convention Areas All tuna RFMOs require unique vessel identifiers such as IMO numbers in order to strengthen their ability to monitor fishing capacity globally through the Consolidated List of Authorized Vessels CLAV Fish Aggregating Device FAD Management Setting on FADs accounts for nearly 40 of global tuna catches and 50 of global skipjack catches The time is ripe for a concerted global effort to gather and report to RFMOs data on FADs eg via logbooks in order to better monitor FAD usage and to establish a sound basis for their management in every ocean region With this information scientists can advise decisionmakers on how to reduce catches of small tunas and bycatch of nontarget species that are commonly associated with FADs Providing science bodies with detailed data on FADs and other floating objects can also greatly improve their stock assessments However with the exception of data collected through observer programs there remains a need and opportunity to improve the information about this type of fishing at the RFMO level In addition there is a growing understanding of best practices in FAD construction and bycatch mitigation developments that ISSF is actively promoting that could be implemented in the short term As noted in CMM 200801s FAD Management Plan guidelines Appendix E and TCC5 200922 in order to adequately monitor FADs there are two primary types of information that need to be collected and reported to RFMO scientific bodies i an inventory and activity record of FADs FAD logbook FAD markings construction specifications deployment retrievals etc and ii a record of encounters of fishing and supply vessels with the FADs fishing logbook catch by species that results from sets made on FADs These two types of information should be linked through the FAD ID or marking Using this data RFMO scientific bodies can and should advise on any necessary FAD management measures followed by the development of effective mechanisms for implementation and compliance monitoring by fishery managers WCPFC CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES CMM 200801 and the Purse Seine Fishery The analyses presented at SC8 corroborate the fact that CMM 200801 has been ineffective in meeting the objectives of controlling purse seine effort and ending the overfishing of the bigeye stock The number of purse seine fishing days continues to increase and the catch of bigeye and the number of FAD sets in 2011 were the highest on record The results of projections presented at SC7 and SC8 suggest that a total seasonal closure of the purse seine fishery as compared to a FAD closure would have only a marginal conservation gain for bigeye whereas there would be a loss in total yield ISSF notes however that these analyses did not consider uncertainty in the implementation of either type of closure ISSF is convinced that a total closure of the,issf support the kobe iii call for a freeze in purse

enforce ISSF supports conservation measures as recommended by the WCPFCs science provider and committee whether FAD closures or limits or total closures provided that the selected measures are both fully enforceable and applicable to all participants Other analyses presented at SC8 suggest that additional management measures such as limiting the number of FAD sets made each year could be used to address the problem of bigeye overfishing ISSF would support a limit on the number of FAD sets as long as it can be properly monitored and enforced throughout the Convention Area This measure and similar ones such as individual vessel bigeye limits has obvious allocation implications and deserves thoughtful negotiation among the parties to ensure consistent implementation In addition monitoring the accumulation of FAD sets per vessel in real time could subject observers to undue pressure from fishers The analyses reviewed by SC7 and SC8 indicate that the exemptions in CMM 200801 account for about onehalf of the overfishing of bigeye tuna ISSF urges WCPFC9 to eliminate these exemptions and to improve bigeye data through more comprehensive reporting of catches by Indonesian and Philippine fleets including catches from all waters and made by all vessels under their jurisdictions Sharks SC8 concluded that the stock of oceanic whitetip shark is overfished and that substantial overfishing is taking place recent fishing mortality is 65 times higher than FMSY The analyses for silky sharks were inconclusive but SC8 recommended that fishing mortality not be allowed to increase Since the major source of mortality for both of these stocks is from nontarget fisheries SC8 concluded that bycatch mitigation measures are the best tool for addressing the conservation of these two vulnerable species To augment WCPFC8s decision regarding the prohibition on oceanic whitetips ISSF urges CCMs to consider more robust bycatch mitigation measures improved data collection and reporting and the development of stockspecific reference points ISSF urges the Commission to take further steps to enforce the existing conservation and management measure addressing shark finning and move to the total prohibition of the atsea removal of shark fins and mandate that fins remain naturally attached for all sharks landed ISSF is also asking all RFMOs including the WCPFC to adopt a prohibition on deliberate purse seine setting around whale sharks As this prohibition is already a requirement for those vessels fishing in PNA waters expanding the measure to other waters in the Convention Area is a natural next step It was understood at WCPFC8 that a finalized measure would be approved at WCPFC9 and ISSF looks forward to its adoption Longlining ISSF notes with concern the continuing increase in the number of longline vessels operating in the WCPFC Convention Area the low levels of observer coverage continuing transshipments at sea and activity in the High Seas beyond coastal

WCPFC10-2013-OP01,4.0,Closed Vessel Registries and Management of Fleet Capacity Experts agree that there is overcapacity in the global tuna fleets Fishing fleet overcapacity increases pressure to weaken management measures and eventually leads to stock overexploitation The first step towards managing capacity is to establish limited entry via a comprehensive closed vessel registry with an eye towards ultimately reducing the number of fishing vessels to an appropriate level The IATTC is the only tuna RFMO with a closed vessel registry although current capacity is well in excess of resource productivity ISSF supports the Kobe III call for a freeze in purse seine fishing capacity by developed fishing nations and creating mechanisms to transfer capacity to developing countries with aspirations to participate in these fisheries These steps should be taken now since scaling back fleet capacity will become even more difficult as new vessels are introduced To this end ISSF urges the following actions All tuna RFMOs develop capacity transfer mechanisms to allow for increased participation by developing countries without an increase in overall capacity while ensuring effective monitoring and control of the fisheries All tuna RFMOs establish rules for monitoring and managing the movement of fishing capacity among the respective Convention Areas All tuna RFMOs require unique vessel identifiers such as IMO numbers in order to strengthen their ability to monitor fishing capacity globally through the Consolidated List of Authorized Vessels CLAV ISSF supports the proposal made by the United States at TCC9 WCPFCTCC92013DP03 to make an IMO number mandatory for purseseine vessels that are steelhulled and 100 GT or GRT by January 1 2015 ISSF urges CCMs to adopt a requirement for IMO numbers at WCPFC10 and encourages the Commission to include the development of a purseseine capacity transfer mechanism in its workplan for 2015 Fish Aggregating Device FAD Management Setting on FADs accounts for nearly 40 of global tuna catches and 50 of global skipjack catches FADs are one of the most important fishing methods for tropical tunas Surprisingly however there are huge gaps in all RFMOs regarding the number of FADs being used and on details of fishing operations on individual FADs Observer programs can be used to collect much but not all of the information needed to appropriately monitor FADs Vessel operators can complement this information as well as provide additional information on individual FADs Collection and reporting of data that can be used to measure fishing effort by FADs is simply a must The WCPFC has adopted Minimum Standard Data Fields for observers that contain much of this information However these data are not being collected consistently as a matter of priority Further there are some types of information that an observer is unlikely or unable to collect such as FAD markings or other identifiers that would enable one to assess if a FAD is being reutilized or being set on or deployed for the first time or details on the FAD design size depth materials This is the type of information that vessel captains can easily collect but observers cannot do so routinely ISSF urges the WCPFC to take two actions this year 1 ensure that the regional observer program routinely collects the FAD data in the WCPFC Minimum Standard Fields and 2 expand the information required from vessels to include data on FAD deployments designs equipment and identification marks As noted by the SC9 it would be easiest to achieve the latter together with the development of electronic logsheets so as to avoid requiring captains to fill out a duplicate form The IOTC and IATTC adopted expanded FAD data collection measures at their annual meetings this year Therefore ISSF is pleased to see that the United States has tabled a proposal on FAD data collection and urges the WCPFC to adopt such a measure this year WCPFC CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES CMM 201201 the Purse Seine Fishery and bigeye tuna The analyses presented at SC9 corroborate the fact that CMM 201201 has been ineffective in meeting the objectives of controlling total purse seine effort and ending the overfishing of the bigeye stock The number of purse seine fishing days continues to increase the catch of bigeye and the number of FAD sets continues to increase over the 20072011 average and the number of FAD sets per day is increasing Analyses considered by SC8 and SC9 indicate that all of the following can reduce bigeye overfishing Additional management measures to limit FAD activities such as extending the FAD closure period limiting the number of FAD sets made each year or the number of FADs that each vessel uses Reducing or eliminating the exemptions in CMM 200801 which account for 50 of the bigeye overfishing Simultaneously considering fishing effort limits for the purse seine fishery and bigeye catch limits for the longline fishery ISSF urges the WCPFC to amend CMM201201 in a comprehensive manner addressing the above elements andor utilizing other science based measures that meet the objective of ending the overfishing of the bigeye stock Sharks SC9 concluded that the stocks of oceanic whitetip and silky sharks are overfished and that overfishing is occurring or highly likely to be occurring on both species It is clear from these stock assessments that catches and mortalities of these shark stocks must be urgently reduced SC9 recommended that the Commission consider measures directed at bycatch mitigation as well as measures directed at targeted catch such as from shark lines to improve the status of the silky shark population ISSF urges CCMs to adopt comprehensive and robust shark conservation and management measures including bycatch mitigation measures improved data collection and reporting and the development of stockspecific reference points ISSF further urges the Commission to take further steps to enforce the existing conservation and management measure addressing shark finning and move to the total prohibition of the atsea removal of shark fins and mandate that fins remain naturally attached for all sharks landed Longlining and Transshipment ISSF notes with concern the continuing increase in the number of longline vessels operating in the WCPFC Convention Area the significant increase in catches of albacore in the South Pacific by longline vessels the low levels of observer coverage data indicates that coverage rates may be less than the required 5 increasing numbers of transshipments at sea beyond flag State control and the failure of some CCMs to provide the required transshipment reports or advance notifications as required by CMM 200906 ISSF notes that electronic monitoring systems are being tested and developed which could potentially be used to address some of these problems ISSF urges WCPFC10 to impose and enforce as a precautionary measure measures to limit longliner capacity in the Convention Area ISSF also urges the Commission to task its scientific body to make recommendations to WCPFC11 regarding the levels of longline capacity consistent with sustainable exploitation and prudent management of target tuna stocks ISSF further urges the Commission to amend its transshipment measure CMM 2009 in order to address these significant gaps in its effectiveness which affect traceability of the products and could result in IUU fishing Compliance and Data Gaps ISSF notes with concern the SC9 information on data gaps including annual catch estimates by EEZ the number of vessels in aggregate data for some fleets shark catches and operational catcheffort data from certain fleets These data are necessary for robust stock assessments and provision of these data is a fundamental obligation of CCMs ISSF urges all CCMs to provide these data to the SPC by the agreed deadlines and in the correct formats ISSF further urges the Commission to consider appropriate responses to promote compliance by those CCMs who have not yet provided operational catch and effort data On the broader issue of compliance monitoring ISSF continues to be concerned with the lack of transparency in the WCPFC Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS In contrast to the other four tuna RFMOs observers are not allowed in the CMS working group meetings and no detailed information on the levels of compliance by member or the responses of members to identified non compliance are released publically Member reports on the implementation of WCPFC measures known as Part II reports are also confidential ISSF urges the Commission to reform its CMS process so that accredited observers may attend its meetings and its reports contain detailed information on the level of compliance by CCM and how they plan to address the areas of identified noncompliance ISSF also supports the development of a scheme of responses to noncompliance by the Commission as soon as possible,closed vessel registries and management of fleet capacity experts agree that there be overcapacity in the global tuna fleet fishing fleet overcapacity increase pressure to weaken management measure and eventually lead to stock overexploitation the first step towards manage capacity be to establish limited entry via a comprehensive closed vessel registry with an eye towards ultimately reduce the number of fishing vessel to an appropriate level the iattc be the only tuna rfmo with a closed vessel registry although current capacity be well in excess of resource productivity issf support the kobe iii call for a freeze in purse seine fishing capacity by develop fishing nation and create mechanism to transfer capacity to develop country with aspiration to participate in these fishery these step should be take now since scale back fleet capacity will become even more difficult as new vessel be introduce to this end issf urge the follow action all tuna rfmo develop capacity transfer mechanism to allow for increase participation by develop country without an increase in overall capacity while ensure effective monitoring and control of the fishery all tuna rfmo establish rule for monitor and manage the movement of fishing capacity among the respective convention areas all tuna rfmo require unique vessel identifier such as imo number in order to strengthen their ability to monitor fishing capacity globally through the consolidated list of authorized vessels clav issf support the proposal make by the united states at tcc9 wcpfctcc92013dp03 to make an imo number mandatory for purseseine vessel that be steelhulle and 100 gt or grt by january 1 2015 issf urge ccm to adopt a requirement for imo number at wcpfc10 and encourage the commission to include the development of a purseseine capacity transfer mechanism in its workplan for 2015 fish aggregate device fad management setting on fad account for nearly 40 of global tuna catch and 50 of global skipjack catch fad be one of the most important fishing method for tropical tuna surprisingly however there be huge gap in all rfmo regard the number of fad be use and on detail of fishing operation on individual fad observer program can be use to collect much but not all of the information need to appropriately monitor fads vessel operator can complement this information as well as provide additional information on individual fad collection and reporting of datum that can be use to measure fishing effort by fad be simply a must the wcpfc have adopt minimum standard data fields for observer that contain much of this information however these datum be not be collect consistently as a matter of priority far there be some type of information that an observer be unlikely or unable to collect such as fad marking or other identifier that would enable one to assess if a fad be be reutilize or be set on or deploy for the first time or detail on the fad design size depth material this be the type of information that vessel captain can easily collect but observer can not do so routinely issf urge the wcpfc to take two action this year 1 ensure that the regional observer program routinely collect the fad datum in the wcpfc minimum standard fields and 2 expand the information require from vessel to include datum on fad deployment design equipment and identification mark as note by the sc9 it would be easiest to achieve the latter together with the development of electronic logsheet so as to avoid require captain to fill out a duplicate form the iotc and iattc adopt expand fad datum collection measure at their annual meeting this year therefore issf be pleased to see that the united states have table a proposal on fad datum collection and urge the wcpfc to adopt such a measure this year wcpfc conservation and management measures cmm 201201 the purse seine fishery and bigeye tuna the analysis present at sc9

WCPFC10-2013-OP02,2.0,Greenpeace Briefing to the 10th Regular Meeting of WCPFC Greenpeace Briefing to the 10th Regular Meeting of WCPFC Cairns Australia 2 to 6 December 2013 Introduction Delegates to the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC have in recent years witnessed very frustrating negotiations Parties have agreed measures based on lowest common denominators which were satisfactory to no one they have showed a lack of will to make difficult choices and worst of all they have compromised the future of Pacific tuna fisheries The result has been ineffective conservation measures that were destined to fail Greenpeace therefore attends this th Annual Meeting of the WCPFC in the hope that the dynamics of previous meetings will be significantly changed The Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPO is in urgent need of fishing capacity reduction and effective controls on fishing effort Both aspects capacity and effort limitations need to work together and parties should recognise they are not mutually exclusive Precautionary target and limit reference points required under the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO Code of Conduct and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement must be adopted Some stocks of great importance continue to be managed unsustainably namely bigeye tuna yellowfin and Pacific bluefin tuna with southern albacore fisheries becoming uneconomical as stocks decline Many shark populations are seriously depleted or stock levels are extremely uncertain and they need to be put on the road to recovery In summary Greenpeace urges parties to the WCPFC to collaborate in order to set the foundations for a sustainable future for WCPO tuna fisheries namely by agreeing an immediate cap on new built longline and purse vessels in the region by developed parties and a clear timebound plan to assess and eliminate overcapacity using environmental and social criteria putting in place an effort management system which works regionally and includes all gears and waters adopting precautionary and ecosystembased target and limit reference points for all major tuna and billfish species closing the loopholes in the fight against Illegal Unregulated and Unreported IUU fishing starting by banning at sea transshipments by all vessels including longliners In addition Greenpeace calls on WCPFC parties to ensure the following pressing issues are effectively addressed at the upcoming meeting a strong Conservation and Management Measure CMM is agreed that ends bigeye tuna overfishing and ensures tropical tuna fisheries are managed according to precautionary and ecosystem based principles taking into account the conservation of all targeted and associated species increases in fishing effort in the southern albacore fishery are immediately halted and precautionary zonebased catch limits are established by the Commission a moratorium on Pacific bluefin tuna fishing is agreed until the stock is recovered and effective management measures are in place effective measures to recover depleted shark populations are taken All parties must be prepared to make compromises to reach agreement What cannot be compromised is the future of Pacific tuna stocks 1 Greenpeace Briefing to the 10th Regular Meeting of WCPFC Addressing the most pressing issues1 Produce an effective clear and enforceable CMM for tropical tunas Although there have been no new tuna stock assessments in 2013 it is clear from the range of fisheries indicators provided for 2012 that the situation for several tuna stocks in the Western and Central Pacific continues to deteriorate as effort increases have resulted in record catches in the region since 200912 Overfishing of adult bigeye in the longline fishery compounded by the increased catches of juveniles as bycatch in purse seine fishing on fish aggregating devices FADs has continued to reduce the bigeye stock to worrying levels The Scientific Committee warned this year that everincreasing catches are exacerbating this problem CMM200801 and subsequent amendments aimed to reduce the high fishing mortality on bigeye tuna by 30 per cent from the 20012004 average level and limit yellowfin tuna fishing mortality to its 2004 level Data presented at Scientific Committee meetings SC7 SC8 and SC9 have made it clear that the CMM200801 was insufficient to achieve these goals34 Longline catches of bigeye have been reduced from 20012004 levels although they have increased slightly in recent years In the core area of the tropical longline fishery catch reductions have occurred alongside a decline in catchperuniteffort CPUE and therefore recent catch declines may be at least in part due to a further decline in the adult bigeye abundance rather than conservation efforts by member States Scientific advice indicates that a combination of prohibiting FADs in the purse seine fishery and restricting longline fishing in bigeye spawning areas would have the greatest impact on the recovery of bigeye tuna The FAD closures in 20092012 resulted in moderately reduced yellowfin and skipjack catches and strongly reduced bigeye catches during the closure periods However despite the closures the total estimated number of FAD sets made in 2011 was a record high mainly due to increased purse seine effort overall with a slight decline in set numbers for 2012 Any proposed replacement of current FAD measures must take into account the burdens of monitoring and enforcing FAD closures and the impact FADs may be having during the closure period in terms of ghost fishing Similarly the drastic reduction in bigeye catches during FAD closure months should be the single most important factor to consider when deliberating the new measure The FAD ban must be yearround to ensure that the benefit of reduced bigeye tuna mortality gained during a shortterm ban are not lost over the remainder of the year A full ban will reduce the bycatch of juvenile yellowfin and assist in the overall reduction of shark bycatch most importantly for depleted oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks This would also most effectively address the unregulated nature of capacity creep in the purse seine fleets due to the proliferation of FAD use Measures must be agreed too on the longline fishery through a combination of prohibiting longlining in bigeye spawning areas closing the high seas pockets to all longline fishing and further reducing fishing effort and capacity within all longline fleets within the remaining high seas and Exclusive Economic Zones EEZs The following components should be included in the new CMM on tropical tunas an objective to reduce fishing mortality of bigeye by 50 per cent from 2011 levels including further cuts to both longline and purse seine bigeye catches the closure of all four high seas pockets to all fishing as a permanent measure Harley S Williams P 2013 A compendium of fisheries indicators for bigeye skipjack yellowfin and

an effective reduction and control of fishing effort adoption and implementation of a yearround ban on the use of FADs in association with purse seine fishing in order to help address excess fishing capacity reduce catches of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna and reduce bycatch of other vulnerable species2 Safeguard albacore tuna Greenpeace again reiterates concern over the increasing number of small to medium scale longliners operating only on the high seas targeting albacore These vessels place an increasing burden on this stock and contribute very little to the economies of adjacent Pacific coastal States as they compete with domestic and locallyowned fleets Although albacore stocks are still considered to be relatively healthy the Scientific Committee has consistently cautioned against further increases in catch on the basis that they would reduce vulnerable biomass larger adults and therefore decrease catch rates and profitability Despite these warnings both catch and effort have increased significantly in recent years Stock assessments have shown a declining spawning biomass Greenpeace urges the Commission to immediately halt any increase in effort in the southern albacore fishery until precautionary zonebased catch limits are established by the Commission that takes into account the rights of adjacent small island coastal States whose small economies are dependent on this fishery3 Conserve shark populations Greenpeace calls on the Commission to urgently address the status of shark populations including by addressing impacts on them by all gears Although sharks are often described as bycatch in longline fisheries it is clear from the common use of practices that deliberately increase shark catches that more longline fisheries should be described as mixed fisheries targeting tuna sharks and billfish These include the use of wire tracers shark lines and bait that attracts sharks5 and crew payment structures that incentivise shark finning6 Oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks despite the poor data available are likely to be in a very poor state with fishing rates well in excess of the FMSY and with stocks declines to well below SBMSY78 In the case of silky sharks the greatest impact on the stock is attributed to bycatch from the longline fishery but there are also significant impacts from the associated purse seine fishery which catches predominantly juveniles The fishing mortality from the associated purse seine fishery is itself above FMSY Initial attempts to provide stock assessments for blue sharks this year have again highlighted extremely poor data available on shark catches Even then several models do indicate that this heavily exploited North Pacific stock may be in an overfished state9 SC9 recommended that a revised assessment be presented at SC10 and in the interim the Commission should adopt the precautionary approach when considering potential management measures for this stock10 Given the importance of sharks in the Pacific ecosystem and the continuing poor availability of data this Commission should agree on a total prohibition of the retention transhipment storage onboard

Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks114 Rescue Pacific bluefin tuna This year SC9 had the opportunity to review the 2012 Pacific bluefin tuna assessment12 presented by the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC The report suggests a catastrophic depletion of Pacific bluefin down to 4 per cent of the unfished biomass with continued overfishing of all ageclasses including an extremely high mortality rate for juveniles of 90 per cent Although consensus was not reached the majority of SC9 recommended an urgent reduction of fishing mortality especially on juveniles and that limit and target reference points be agreed that are consistent with the Commissions adopted or default reference points The InterAmerican tropical Tuna Commission IATTC has adopted a catch limit for the eastern Pacific however there have been no limits set by the WCPFC for the western Pacific where the vast majority of catches are taken Given the dire state of the Pacific bluefin tuna population Greenpeace calls on the Commission to agree on a moratorium on all directed Pacific bluefin tuna fishing until such time that a management plan is agreed and implemented and the stock has shown conclusive evidence of recovery to levels above an agreed biomass limit reference point Building the basis for sustainable tuna fisheries management in the region Indicators from the 9th Regular Session of the WCPFC Science Committee SC9 have revealed an alarming picture of the current fishing capacity in the convention area13 The elimination of fishing overcapacity is one of the most serious challenges facing all tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisations RFMOs purse seine and longline vessel numbers capacity and overall fishing effort are at an alltime high in the WCPO1415 Since the introduction of CMM200801 there has been an increase in purse seine effort Effort peaked in 2011 however VMS data shows that effort in 2012 was 8 per cent higher than 2010 levels and similar to 2011 effort levels In addition the efficiency of the effort has increased and there appears to have been a change in how days are

transit days counted as nonfishing days16 Overcapacity is a main driver of overfishing Fishing capacity management schemes mostly deal with amount of capacity such as vessel numbers and size engine power but rarely if ever with the type of vessel and its gear and their environmental and social impacts1 Eliminate overcapacity Greenpeace has just produced the report Managing Fishing Capacity in the Western and Central Pacific Tuna Fisheries which outlines a process by which the appropriate amount and type of capacity can be first identified in the WCPO and the least environmentally and socially sustainable capacity can be eliminated Work to eliminate overcapacity must provide for the equitable allocation of access to resources using a set of transparent and equitable environmental and social criteria that ensure the rights of developing coastal States and communities to participate in and benefit from tuna fisheries Greenpeace is advocating that coastal States develop domestic tuna fisheries based on selective fishing techniques that are more suitable for use by coastal communities and have a lower impact on the ecosystem in terms of limiting bycatch17 In doing so the rights and needs of developing coastal States could be addressed at the same time replacing more unsustainable distant water fishing capacity in the region Greenpeace is calling on the Commission to urgently agree to cap the number of longline and purse seine vessels in the fishery and prioritise the development of a clear timebound plan to assess and eliminate overcapacity in the WCPO that takes into consideration social and environmental criteria for reducing overcapacity in tuna fisheries18 This process should identify the most environmentally and socially appropriate type and amount of fishing capacity that should be allowed in a given fishery so as to manage it sustainably This could constitute the basis for a scheme which would grant preferential access to vessels and gears which score the highest Further allocation of the right to fish to individual operators should be based on a participatory and transparent decisionmaking framework and should exclude those with poor records of reporting and compliance Local fishing communities fulfilling the criteria should have primary access Greenpeace recommends that the following criteria be adopted within the plan to eliminate overcapacity from WCPO tuna fisheries to guide decisions on which vessels and fleets should be granted the fishing opportunities available under a precautionary management model Selectivity fishing methods with low bycatch Environmental impact less destructive fishing methods Energy consumption vessels and fishing methods consuming less energy per tonne of fish caught Employment and working conditions fishing methods that provide more and better employment conditions compliant with international standards Socio economic benefits greater direct income to and investment in the region derived from the fishing operations Quality of product gear types providing the best quality of fish for human consumption History of compliance past compliance with applicable rules including quality of data provided by fishers as well as member states should be considered when granting access to a fishery Pilling G Williams P Hampton J Harley S 2013 Analysis of the implementation and

working conditions socioeconomic benefits quality of the product and history of compliance among others 5 Greenpeace Briefing to the 10th Regular Meeting of WCPFC2 Ensure effective effort management Limits to both capacity and effort are required As long as excess fishing capacity in terms of physical assets vessels etc exists vessels owners and companies will continue to exert political pressure to ensure that they obtain maximum fisheries access to remain financially viable and will maintain a situation where breaking the rules is seen as a necessary risk Currently the main tool to manage fishing effort in the WCPO is the Parties to the Nauru Agreement PNA Vessel Day Scheme VDS Due to several exemptions to the system as well as its current scope it only applies to the EEZs of PNA members the VDS has not managed to date to prevent an expansion of both fishing capacity and effort in the region Greenpeace believes that in order to be effective as a fisheries management tool19 the VDS must be expanded in its scope and include all fishing effort in the region including all gears and all waters20 A stringent monitoring and penalty system must also be put into place and enforced In addition Greenpeace warns that a wellfunctioning VDS doesnt remove the need for capacity management In the absence of capacity management consistent with environmental and social access and allocation criteria a reduced number of days available under the VDS alone would expel the least financially strong operators potentially benefiting the most industrial or heavily subsidised operations that can bid at higher prices for VDS days To avoid such an outcome the VDS should be applied after preferential access has been granted to local fishing communities operating in a sustainable manner Greater economic benefits for coastal states can be derived from their own local fisheries as opposed to foreign access fees making this an even more economically beneficial option in the long term Following allocation of local fishing opportunities any remaining vessel days could be sold to operators best fulfilling the environmental and social criteria and contributing the most to sustainable livelihoods in the region as opposed to simple financial contribution of access fees as is the current practice3 Adopt precautionary target and limit reference points Setting strong fisheries reference points and strict harvest control rules is a key part of implementing the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement Some of the work carried out so far at the WCPFC on choosing and setting target and limit reference points is described in more detail in the Greenpeace submission to the SC921 Greenpeace considers progress in this area to be crucial for the future success of the Commission Both target and limit reference points need to be precautionary and the risk of breaching a reference point needs to be very low While ultimately the assurance that limit reference points are not breached by fisheries depends on choosing good target reference points and strong harvest control rules and on swift action by management Greenpeace also believes that a sea change in how managers and industry perceive and understand target and limit reference points is key to gaining agreement for significantly improving management of Pacific fisheries The Commission has previously adopted the biomass limit reference points LRPs for tuna and striped marlin recommended by the Scientific Committee in 2012 SC8 Greenpeace urges the Commission to adopt the recommendations of SC9 to select fishing mortality limit reference points for each species that ensure a high probability that biomass LRPs will not be breached22 Greenpeace supports the selection of a 5 per cent acceptable risk level for all species ie 95 probability of maintaining the stock above biomass LRPs Greenpeace further urges the Commission to set limit and target reference points for all species managed by the WCPFC The VDS has been undoubtedly effective as a tool to increase the revenue obtained by PNA countries from the tuna resources in their EEZs

January 2010 purse seine fishing effort remained largely concentrated in EEZs until 2012 In 2012 there was an increase in the amount of purse seine effort in the HSPs attributed to transit activity andor to effort by the Philippines vessels permitted under CMM 201101 Governments and domestic longline fleets in the central Pacific have indicated their concern over international fleets operating solely in the eastern high seas pocket and using this as a platform to tranship catch out of the region In 2012 a high seas boarding and inspection patrol boarded 11 vessels in this pocket and detected violations on six of these including nonreporting of entry23 In 2013 11 vessels were boarded again and six of these vessels were found in violation of existing CMMs again including for nonreporting of entry into the high seas pocket as required under the special management measure The reopening of high seas pockets 1 and 2 at WCPFC8 came with a number of preconditions including the need for better monitoring of fleets and strict implementation of and compliance with monitoring control and surveillance MCS measures Subsequent activities by Philippine vessels in high seas pocket 1 and neighbouring EEZs reveal a number of concerning issues Since the Technical and Compliance Committees meeting TCC8 in 2012 Greenpeace documented a raft of IUU activities and other anomalies by vessels fishing in high seas pocket 1 including Philippine flagged vessels These were reported to the Commission2425 in Manila in December 2012 However despite the clear documentation those cases somehow did not prevent the Philippines from receiving a good rating for compliance at TCC9 The activities documented included an unlicensed Philippine fishing vessel Sal 19 transshipping illegally on the high seas failure by a licensed high seas seiner Geneviva to report via VMS to the adjacent coastal states as required under Philippine regulations and no VMS reporting at all by Sal 19 Upon approach by Greenpeace the IUU transshipment was halted and three of the vessels involved fled into Indonesias EEZ Sal 19 was spotted eight days later in Palaus EEZ with its name painted over not reporting on either VMS or AIS and with no log book or other fishing or transhipment records Furthermore Greenpeace and Palauan authorities while on joint patrol of Palaus EEZ in November 2012 discovered a number of illegally deployed anchored FADs within Palau waters near the high seas border similar in construction to those being deployed by the Philippine purse seiners on the high seas Those blatant IUU activities highlight the need to phase out the exemption for Philippine purse seiners to fish in the high seas and call into question the rigour of the compliance assessment process being followed by TCC At the very least compliance discussions should be open to accredited observers and the country whose compliance is being discussed while having the opportunity to respond to issues raised should not be able to block consensus on a poor score Furthermore all reported IUU incidents from any source should be included in the next TCC compliance discussion and placed on a public record Greenpeace calls on the Commission to recommend that all four high seas pockets be permanently closed to all forms of fishing as part of a new conservation measure for skipjack yellowfin and bigeye This must include a phase out of the Philippine purse seine fleet from the high seas pocket during the lifetime of the tropical tuna CMM as part of a national plan to reduce overcapacity and ensure sustainable fisheries also inside Philippine EEZ Bunkering and atsea transhipments should be banned In addition the Commissions Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS currently in its third trial year must be strengthened and a strict penalty and sanctions regime must be applied in all TCC 2013 Annual Report on Eastern High Seas Pocket Special Management Area ReportingTechnical and Compliance

httpbitlySyxxi2 Greenpeace International findings at sea November 2012 httpbitlyVj8637 7 Greenpeace Briefing to the 10th Regular Meeting of WCPFC cases of noncompliance Failure to comply must be linked to loss of access thereby contributing to the process of reducing fishing capacity In addition to closing the high seas pockets to fishing and banning transshipments at sea the WCPFC must also act to create a meaningful disincentive to IUU fishing It is of extreme concern that some vessels and fleets appear to have made IUU fishing part of their business model despite repeated settlement payments In many cases the value of the tuna catch and level of subsidies received by the vessel or company mean that those settlements although significant are not alone enough to change behaviour The WCPFC must remove the secrecy surrounding compliance discussions and place all IUU activity from the past year onto the public record regardless of whether settlement has been reached or a vessel is blacklisted This enables legal and ethical traders to avoid buying fish that may have been stolen from Pacific Island countries Furthermore IUU compliance records must be a criterion within a transparent system of evaluating vessels and companies before fishing access is granted When capacity reduction is a critical task ahead of the Commission those vessels that have repeatedly violated CMMs should be the first to be removed from the fishery5 Operate with transparency Greenpeace together with other nongovernment organisations has expressed its concern at the disturbing trend regarding the level of transparency and openness in WCPFC meetings and information sharing by the Commission This includes the increasing number of closed sessions documents being posted on the secure website unavailable to organisations with accredited observer status and draft meeting reports being sent only to member states and not to other organisations that attended and contributed to those meetings We recognise the need under exceptional circumstances for documents or discussions to be restricted as provided for under the WCPFCs rules However we believe that currently much of this information is unnecessarily limited and too many discussions are inappropriately designated as confidential The WCPFC is no longer following best practice by RFMOs with regards to transparency and we urge an improvement at WCPFC10 and in future meetings and working groups6 Share the burdens and benefits The WCPFC Convention Article 30 states the need to ensure that such measures do not result in transferring directly or indirectly a disproportionate burden of conservation action onto developing States Parties and territories and possessions and this issue has been raised in regard to the replacement measure for 200,greenpeace briefing to the 10th regular meeting of wcpfc greenpeace briefing to the 10th regular meeting of wcpfc cairns australia 2 to 6 december 2013 introduction delegates to the western and central pacific fisheries commission wcpfc have in recent year witness very frustrating negotiation parties have agree measure base on low common denominator which be satisfactory to no one they have show a lack of will to make difficult choice and bad of all they have compromise the future of pacific tuna fisherie the result have be ineffective conservation measure that be destine to fail greenpeace therefore attend this th annual meeting of the wcpfc in the hope that the dynamic of previous meeting will be significantly change the western and central pacific ocean wcpo be in urgent need of fishing capacity reduction and effective control on fishing effort both aspect capacity and effort limitation need to work together and party should recognise they be not mutually exclusive precautionary target and limit reference point require under the food and agriculture organization fao code of conduct and the united nations fish stocks agreement must be adopt some stock of great importance continue to be manage unsustainably namely bigeye tuna yellowfin and pacific bluefin tuna with southern albacore fishery become uneconomical as stock decline many shark population be seriously deplete or stock level be extremely uncertain and they need to be put on the road to recovery in summary greenpeace urge party to the wcpfc to collaborate in order to set the foundation for a sustainable future for wcpo tuna fishery namely by agree an immediate cap on new build longline and purse vessel in the region by develop party and a clear timebound plan to assess and eliminate overcapacity use environmental and social criterion put in place an effort management system which work regionally and include all gear and water adopt precautionary and ecosystembased target and limit reference point for all major tuna and billfish specie close the loophole in the fight against illegal unregulated and unreported iuu fishing start by ban at sea transshipment by all vessel include longliner in addition greenpeace call on wcpfc party to ensure the follow press issue be effectively address at the upcoming meeting a strong conservation and management measure cmm be agree that end bigeye tuna overfishe and ensure tropical tuna fishery be manage accord to precautionary and ecosystem base principle take into account the conservation of all target and associate species increase in fishing effort in the southern albacore fishery be immediately halt and precautionary zonebase catch limit be establish by the commission a moratorium on pacific bluefin tuna fishing be agree until the stock be recover and effective management measure be in place effective measure to recover deplete shark population be take all party must be prepare to make compromise to reach agreement what can not be compromise be the future of pacific tuna stock 1 greenpeace briefing to the 10th regular meeting of wcpfc address the most pressing issues1 produce an effective clear and enforceable cmm for tropical tuna although there have be no new tuna stock assessment in 2013 it be clear from the range of fishery indicator provide for 2012 that the situation for several tuna stock in the western and central pacific continue to deteriorate as effort increase have result in record catch in the region since 200912 overfishing of adult bigeye in the longline fishery compound by the increase catch of juvenile as bycatch in purse seine fishing on fish aggregate device fads have continue to reduce the bigeye stock to worrying level the scientific committee warn this year that everincrease catch be exacerbate this problem cmm200801 and subsequent amendment aim to reduce the high fishing mortality on bigeye tuna by 30 per cent from the 20012004 average level and limit yellowfin tuna fishing mortality to its 2004 level datum present at scientific committee meeting sc7 sc8 and sc9 have make it clear that the cmm200801 be insufficient to achieve these goals34 longline catch of bigeye have be reduce from 20012004 level although they have increase slightly in recent year in the core area of the tropical longline fishery catch reduction have occur alongside a decline in catchperuniteffort cpue and therefore recent catch decline may be at least in part due to a further decline in the adult bigeye abundance rather than conservation effort by member states scientific advice indicate that a combination of prohibit fad in the purse seine fishery and restrict longline fishing in bigeye spawning area would have the great impact on the recovery of bigeye tuna the fad closure in 20092012 result in moderately reduce yellowfin and skipjack catch and strongly reduce bigeye catch during the closure period however despite the closure the total estimate number of fad set make in 2011 be a record high mainly due to increase purse seine effort overall with a slight decline in set number for 2012 any propose replacement of current fad measure must take into account the burden of monitor and enforce fad closure and the impact fad may be have during the closure period in term of ghost fish similarly the drastic reduction in bigeye catch during fad closure month should be the single most important factor to consider when deliberate the new measure the fad ban must be yearround to ensure that the benefit of reduced bigeye tuna mortality gain during a shortterm ban be not lose over the remainder of the year a full ban will reduce the bycatch of juvenile yellowfin and assist in the overall reduction of shark bycatch most importantly for deplete oceanic whitetip shark and silky shark this would also most effectively address the unregulated nature of capacity creep in the purse seine fleet due to the proliferation of fad use measure must be agree too on the longline fishery through a combination of prohibit longline in bigeye spawning area close the high sea pocket to all longline fishing and far reduce fishing effort and capacity within all longline fleet within the remain high sea and exclusive economic zones eez the follow component should be include in the new cmm on tropical tuna an objective to reduce fishing mortality of bigeye by 50 per cent from 2011 level include further cut to both longline and purse seine bigeye catch the closure of all four high sea pocket to all fish as a permanent measure

with domestic and locallyowne fleet although albacore stock be still consider to be relatively healthy the scientific committee have consistently caution against further increase in catch on the basis that they would reduce vulnerable biomass large adult and therefore decrease catch rate and profitability despite these warning both catch and effort have increase significantly in recent year stock

capacity in the western and central pacific tuna fisheries which outline a process by which the appropriate amount and type of capacity can be first identify in the wcpo and the least environmentally and socially sustainable capacity can be eliminate work to eliminate overcapacity must provide for the equitable allocation of access to resource use a set of transparent and equitable environmental and social criterion that ensure the right of develop coastal states and community to participate in and benefit from tuna fishery greenpeace be advocate that coastal state develop domestic tuna fishery base on selective fishing technique that be more suitable for use by coastal community and have a low impact on the ecosystem in term of limit bycatch17 in do so the right and need of develop coastal states could be address at the same time replace more unsustainable distant water fishing capacity in the region greenpeace be call on the commission to urgently agree to cap the number of longline and purse seine vessel in the fishery and prioritise the development of a clear timebound plan to assess and eliminate overcapacity in the wcpo that take into consideration social and environmental criterion for reduce overcapacity in tuna fisheries18 this process should identify the most environmentally and socially appropriate type and amount of fishing capacity that should be allow in a give fishery so as to manage it sustainably this could constitute the basis for a scheme which would grant preferential access to vessel and gear which score the high further allocation of the right to fish to individual operator should be base on a participatory and transparent decisionmake framework and should exclude those with poor record of reporting and compliance local fishing community fulfil the criterion should have primary access greenpeace recommend that the follow criterion be adopt within the plan to eliminate overcapacity from wcpo tuna fishery to guide decision on

must be expand in its scope and include all fishing effort in the region include all gear and all waters20 a stringent monitoring and penalty system must also be put into place and enforce in addition greenpeace warn that a wellfunctione vds do not remove the need for capacity management in the absence of capacity management consistent with environmental and social access and allocation criterion a reduce number of day available under the vds alone would expel the least financially strong operator potentially benefit the most industrial or heavily subsidise operation that can bid at high price

implement the fao code of conduct for responsible fisheries and the un fish stock agreement some of the work carry out so far at the wcpfc on choose and set target and limit reference point be describe in more detail in the greenpeace submission to the sc921 greenpeace consider progress in this area to be crucial for the future success of the commission both target and limit reference point need to be precautionary and the risk of breach a reference point need to be very low while ultimately the assurance that limit reference point be not breach by fishery depend on choose good target reference point and strong harvest control rule and on swift action by management greenpeace also believe that a sea change in how manager and industry perceive and understand target and limit reference point be key to gain agreement for significantly improve management of pacific fishery the commission have previously adopt the biomass limit reference point lrp for tuna and striped marlin recommend by the scientific committee in 2012 sc8 greenpeace urge the commission to adopt the recommendation of sc9 to select fishing mortality limit reference point for each specie that ensure a high probability that biomass lrp will not be breached22 greenpeace support the selection of a 5 per cent acceptable risk level for all specie ie 95 probability of maintain the stock above biomass lrp greenpeace far urge the commission to set limit and target reference point for all specie manage by the wcpfc the vds have be undoubtedly effective as a tool to increase the revenue obtain by pna

WCPFC10-2013-OP03,2.0,Recommendations to the 10th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission6 December 2013 Cairns Australia A brief from Nov 2013 The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC aims to ensure the longterm conservation and sustainable use of the fish stocks including tuna and sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean The WCPFC has a unique and important responsibility as custodian of the worlds largest tuna fishery in an area covering 20 percent of the Earths surface Sustaining healthy fisheries in this region requires strong conservation and management actions through joint commitments and strict compliance Unfortunately the Commissions Members Cooperating Nonmembers and Participating Territories known collectively as CCMs have been unable to take the actions needed to ensure the sustainability of highly migratory fish populations This years Commission meeting is critical to the future of bigeye and Pacific bluefin tuna as well as many shark species The Pew Charitable Trusts calls on governments involved in the WCPFC to agree to take the following critical actions End overfishing in tuna fisheries and strengthen management to ensure sustainability Strengthen controls so as to end illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing Adopt conservation and management measures to protect sharks Recommendations End overfishing in tuna fisheries and strengthen management to ensure sustainability This year the WCPFC must demonstrate that it can manage the worlds largest tuna fishery responsibly by implementing precautionary reference points acting to end overfishing of bigeye tuna and moving to rebuild the severely depleted Pacific bluefin population Reference points The 2012 and 2013 Management Objectives Workshops provided CCMs with the information needed to implement the Convention requirement to determine appropriate reference points and conservation actions for these species of tuna1 This is an important step toward a more precautionary sciencebased management system that will better protect the ecosystem and fisheries from future declines The WCPFC should adopt interim target and limit reference points for skipjack albacore yellowfin bluefin and bigeye tuna CCMs also should continue discussions on harvestcontrol rules that ensure that limit reference points are not exceeded and that targets achieve the desired outcomes Masa Ushioda SeaPicscom Skipjack tuna Tropical tuna measure Ending overfishing of bigeye tuna Negotiations on the new tropical tuna Conservation and Management Measure CMM have failed to adhere to the scientific advice as each party to the talks worked to minimize the impact on its fishing operations This has led to an overly complex measure that relies on management tools that have already proved ineffective for this fishery and would be difficult to enforce The Commission must commit to ending overfishing of bigeye tuna by 2018 by adopting a CMM for tropical tuna that freezes fishing capacity caps longline catch and limits the amount of fishing by purseseiners on fish aggregating devices FADs to sustainable levels consistent with the advice from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community SPC The CMM must be reviewed and updated next year based on the results of the 2014 stock assessments of bigeye and yellowfin tuna The Commission must commit to ending overfishing of bigeye tuna by 2018 Alex HoffordGreenpeace via Marine Photobank A school of tuna swims in a purseseine net in Papua New Guinea waters In addition CCMs fishing with FADs should be required to submit management plans for these devices which should include information on the numbers deployed recovered and lost as well as FAD tracking data This data would give the Scientific Committee more information on the extent of FAD use the potential effects on the ecosystem tied to their uncontrolled proliferation and the scope of this fisherys contribution to marine debris It also would provide greater insight into how FAD use contributes to IUU fishing To ensure that the effectiveness of the new CMM can be measured all CCMs should provide all relevant data on their fisheries to the Commission Without this critical information on catch rates spatial patterns and the numbers of fishing vessels operating in the Convention Area cannot be confirmed Observer coverage can provide such data and all CCMs should endeavor to increase observer coverage to at least 20 percent Given the high impact that largescale freezer longliners have on target associated and dependent species the WCPFC should mandate 100 percent observer coverage on these vessels Pacific bluefin tuna Based on the International Scientific Committees ISC latest stock assessment the Pacific bluefin population is at just 36 percent of its original size and both the ISC and the WCPFC Scientific Committee have recommended that fishing mortality be reduced from recent levels to limit the risk of further population declines At its 2013 meeting however the Commissions Northern Committee recommended a measure that would allow overall catch to rise above levels seen in the last two years In doing so the Northern Committee has again agreed to management measures that are inadequate to protect this severely depleted species Therefore the WCPFC should recommend that the Northern Committee develop a rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin tuna for adoption by the 11th Regular Session of the WCPFC that includes catch limits that would return the population to 25 percent SSBrecent F0 25 percent of the original population size within the next 10 years If the WCPFC again fails to adopt and implement appropriate management measures fishing for Pacific bluefin tuna should be suspended until such precautionary sciencebased measures are put in place Strengthen controls against IUU fishing IUU fishing remains a threat in the WCPFC Convention Area To enhance compliance with CMMs the Commission should require that vessels fishing in its waters have mandatory unique and permanent identification numbers The WCPFC also should adopt a new measure on port State controls The International Maritime Organization IMO number is an essential element of any system to ensure compliance with fisheries laws and to aid safety and security at sea2 The WCPFC should improve the transparency of fishing vessels activities by requiring that those licensed to fish in the Convention Area have an IMO number The Commission also should Require members to submit the IMO number of any vessel authorized to fish in the Convention Area that already has such a number and mandate that the number be included in the Commission Record of Fishing Vessels Require that all vessels3 authorized to fish in the WCPFC Convention Area have an IMO number by Jan 1 and that this number be reported in all records and relevant communications involving these vessels The number should be permanently marked in a visible place on the vessels hull Courtesy of Australian Fisheries Management Authority Vessel crew paints a new name on the hull at sea to avoid enforcement for illegal fishing crimes committed under prior name In addition port State measures PSMs are costeffective tools to prevent fish caught illegally from entering the market WCPFCs Performance Review recommended adoption of PSMs warning that the Commission is lagging behind other regional fisheries management organizations in doing so4 The WCPFC should initiate development of a regional scheme of PSMs adopting at this meeting minimum standards for port inspections and providing adequate support to developing States for implementation High seas transshipment continues to be used in the WCPFC Convention Area as a way to avoid proper catch reporting and to launder IUU catch The WCPFC should introduce a ban on high seas transshipment until it can be ensured that transshipment operations cannot assist IUU fishing This would require having a robust monitoring system in place that includes full transparency requiring observers on board the offloading and receiving vessels and complete oversight by the Commission of all transshipment operations in the Convention Area The WCPFC should improve the transparency of fishing vessels activities by requiring that those licensed to fish in the Convention Area have an IMO number Silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis Adopt CMMs to protect sharks The latest stock assessment shows that the silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis a lowproductivity species is in an overfished state in the WCPFC Convention Area and that overfishing continues5 Given this evidence the WCPFC should follow the best practice established by the Commission when it prohibited the retention of oceanic whitetip sharks It is essential that the WCPFC prohibit the retention on board transshipment storage and landing of silky sharks this year This will be most effective in combination with improved shark bycatchmitigation measures to prevent initial catch of this and other vulnerable shark species Among the most effective are the use of nonentangling FADs6 and controls on the use of wire leaders7 shark lines and shark bait8 We recommend that the WCPFC mandate the use of nonentangling FADs and prohibit the use of wire leaders shark lines and shark bait It is essential that the

Introduction and Summary The World Wide Fund for Nature WWF would like to thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC for the opportunity to attend the 10th Regular Session as an observer and to address the critically important role that it plays in the proper management of the Western Central Pacific Ocean WCPO fisheries The regulatory measures proposed and implemented by the WCPFC represent one of the legs of the threelegged stool of successful sustainable and responsible fisheries management the other legs consisting of the science provided by the Scientific Committee SC and the compliance measures provided by the Technical and Compliance Committee TCC Without firm support on each one of those three components the stool falls over and fisheries management fails WWF once again calls on members of the WCPFC to address the issues and recommendations raised at SC9 TCC9 and WCPFC9 as well as observe the experience of other RFMOs in their own efforts to achieve and maintain improved measures for monitoring and surveillance WWF wishes to reiterate its position offered in Manila in December 2012 WCPFC9 and taking into account the WCPFCrelated meetings held since the recommendations listed in bullets below For more detail and background on each position please reference the associated Appendix for this document Reference Points Harvest Control Rules and Harvest Strategies WWF recommends that the WCPFC Designate of Limit and Target Reference Points as a priority for proper management of stocks under WCPFC authority Establish precautionary Bbased Limit Reference Points preferably based on Spawning Biomass for all WCPO fish stocks under its authority Adopt supplementary and precautionary Fbased Limit Reference Points to attempt to control the exploitation rate for all WCPO fish stocks under its authority Implementadopt interim precautionary Target Reference Points as a benchmark for further consideration by the MOW and WCPFC in 2013 and Ensure the probability of breaching the Limit Reference Points and limiting this to a risk level of 10 or less as a precautionary measure Gregg Yan WWF POSITION DECEMBER Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper ii WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF POSITION Tropical Tunas WWF recommends that the WCPFC Support and endorse further research and monitoring of FADs Engage in an open and transparent deliberative process based on the best available scientific information to determine the level of reductions in BET catch necessary to achieve meaningful BET conservation Pacific Bluefin Tuna WWF recommends that the WCPFC Adopt a longterm Pacific bluefin recovery plan candidate limit and target reference points and harvest control rules that are welldefined preagreed and contain mandatory actions for a determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points Remove all exemptions under the current CMM for Pacific Bluefin tuna through a revised CMM201206 Sharks WWF recommends the WCPFC Develop endorse and adopt a Comprehensive Shark CMM that includes efforts to o Mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs o Implement the recommendations for Bycatch that were endorsed at Kobe III and adopt an annually updated report card system against these recommendations for all of the WCPFC fisheries o Require through data collected from observer programs and other means estimation of the number of captures and releases of all sharks and rays including the status upon release dead or alive and reporting of this information to the WCPFC o Require through observers programs recording what gear is used in longline activities including the use of wire traces and any multi monofilament traces in order to avoid biteoff by sharks o Introduce a scheme to document the capture and trade of sharks whereby it allows for traceability through to the final market state and o Ensure the implementation requirements for CITES listed sharks are fully understood and planned for in preparation for CITES Parties and NonParties trading with CITES Parties needing to make Nondetriment Sustainability and legal findings in order to issue Export permits for trade in these species by September 2014 Encourage the development of reference points and management for nontarget species including blue sharks as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Silky Sharks With respect to silky sharks WWF recommends the WCPFC Consistent with measures established for oceanic whitetip shark impose additional mitigation measures and maintain existing measures in an effort to improve the status of the WCPO silky shark stock including o mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper iii WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF POSITION o prohibit the retention transhipment storage onboard sale and landing of silky sharks in all fisheries managed by the WCPFC o mandate the prompt and careful release of any captured silky sharks and o require through data collected from observer programs and other means estimation of the number of releases of silky sharks including the status upon release dead or alive and reporting of this information to the WCPFC Encourage the development of reference points and management for nontarget species including silky sharks as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Regional Observer Program With respect to the ROP WWF recommends the WCPFC Further implementation of a binding consistent and consolidated set of standards for the ROP Develop an analysis of the observer programme in the context of proper management including an analysis of different funding models Review and consider for endorsement or adoption the recommendations of the Association for Professional Observers contained in the International Observer Bill of Rights and associated documents Catch Documentation Scheme With respect to the development of a comprehensive CDS WWF recommends the WCPFC Consider the following elements of a robust CDS system including o A requirement for documentation to accompany all catch harvested landed transhipped traded domestically exported processed imported and reexported and which relies on electronic documentation o Complementary measures to maximize the effectiveness of the CDS through ensuring that transhipment at sea does not compromise the effectiveness of the CDS adopting Port State Measures implemented simultaneously with the CDS and adopting trade restriction measures against flag States with vessels on the IUU list o Parameters that include all species of tunas billfish and sharks managed by the WCPFC Consider additional elements to support the integrity reliability and sustainability of a CDS system including o A commitment to continuous improvement of the CDS by investigating the benefits and feasibility of verification systems such as electronic tagging and the use of biotechnology o Establishment of a capacity development fund to provide a costsharing mechanism that enables progressive cost sharing among member states and o Maximizing retailer and public access to data through modern electronic tools Conclusion WWF once again calls on the WCPFC to look carefully look at our collective conduct as nations with a responsibility for managing fishery resources in the WCPFC CA With respect to each of the agenda items addressed at the WCPFC10 Regular Meeting the commission delegates must genuinely consider whether previous actions have been responsible and commendable in achieving the overarching goal of fisheries sustainability in the WCPO Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper iv WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF POSITION The WCPFC shares the distinction as the youngest RFMO but is also regarded as arguably the most effective However we all must constantly guard against the complacency and greed that leads to poor decisionmaking resulting in the collapsing fish stocks in other regions Unfortunately with some stocks in the WCPO such as bigeye tuna oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks we are treading dangerously down a path leading to trouble The WCPFC possesses the ability and opportunity to chart the course towards sustainable fishery resources especially tuna in the WCPO The WCPFC and its subsidiary bodies must continually promote and adopt strong and effective conservation and management action to maintain and rebuild tuna stocks implement appropriate monitoring and enforcement measures promote a viable tuna industry and support vibrant coastal communities throughout the South Pacific 1986 Panda Symbol WWF World Wide Fund For Nature Formerly World

Points Harvest Control Rules and Harvest Strategies WWF remains supportive of the work of the WCPFC and subsidiary bodies in pursuing the implementation of Reference Points RP Harvest Control Rules HCR and Harvest Strategies HS WWF encourages WCPFC10 to endorse and support the adoption of explicit Limit and Target Reference Points LRPTRP for all WCPO fishery stocks under WCPFC authority developed through the subsidiary bodies as well as the Management Objectives Workshop Reference points provide management decisionmakers an objective tool to determine whether a fish stock size is becoming too small or fishing pressure is becoming too great WWF notes that the WCPFC has discussed and considered RPs since 2006 and that while the SC and TCC have made several recommendations to the WCPFC on appropriate RPs the WCPFC has failed to adopt formal explicit RPs Furthermore while stock assessments conducted by SPC use BMSY and FMSY as implicit LRPs and provide advice to the WCPFC these proxies do not represent limits consistent with the recommendations of the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement UNFSA and more refined RPs are justified based on the available scientific information1 The WCPFC must implement RPs and HCRs as a priority for the sustainable management of the fishery resources in the WCPO Existing science supports the implementation of welldefined and precautionary biologicallybased LRPs and WWF generally supports the previous recommendations of the SC Therefore WWF supports the recommendations of SC8 and SC9 that LRPs for bigeye tuna BET yellowfin tuna YFT and South Pacific albacore ALB be set at Level 2 with regard to the biomassbased LRP of 20SBrecentF0 with the application of a sufficiently precautionary value of X in the Level 2 fishing mortalitybased LRP of FxSPR2 Furthermore WWF suggests that the WCPFC should acknowledge that LRPs are predominantly scientific in nature and may be set completely independently of and without relationship to TRPs At the SC9 meeting in Pohnpei most Members Cooperating Nonmembers and Participating Territories CCMs reiterated a preference for establishing biomass Bbased LRPs While the assumptions uncertainties and substantial amounts of information associated with biomass B based LRPs make them a less attractive option to some stakeholders they constitute a critical tool to ensure that stock sustainability is maintained Fbased LRPs are important and useful but not as critical as a Bbased limit because a Bbased limit ensures a biological floor that the fishery cannot go Gregg Yan WWF POSITION DECEMBER Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF POSITION below Reference points that specify a minimum biomass level for the stock below which the fishery is curtailed or in the extreme case closed have the advantages that Biomass is more directly linked to recruitment than is the fishing mortality rate Minimum biomass levels provide a guide for management of stocks that are already depleted by setting a standard for rebuilding and During periods of adverse environmental conditions a minimum biomass level provides a seed stock for eventual recovery when conditions are more favourable In 2012 WCPFC9 requested the SC9 develop appropriate timewindows for analyzing and calculating unfished biomass levels WWF supports the recommendation of SC9 that the timewindow to be used in the LRP 20SBF0 t1t2 satisfies the following criteria have a length of 10 years be based on the years t1ylast10 to t2ylast1 where ylast is the last year used in the assessment and the approach used for calculating the unfished biomass levels be based on scaled estimates of recruitment according to the stock recruitment relationship WWF generally supports the implementation of any Management Strategy Evaluation MSE measures that serve to improve the understanding of the impacts of particular management measures Thus consistent with SC9 advice WWF endorses the recommendation that this timewindow be subject to periodic review to ensure this approach is appropriately representing future conditions for the individual stocks While WWF continues to hold that the establishment of Bbased limits are more important because they ensure a biological floor that the fishery cannot go below we nonetheless believe that Fbased LRPs also represent useful tools to control fishing capacity or in other words the rate at which the harvest influences the stock size WWF supports some CCMs recommendation of the matching approach to determining Fbased limit reference points that are equivalent to the spawning biomass limit reference points Consequently WWF supports the recommendation of SC9 that the identification of the appropriate values of X for each species in the LRP FXSPR0 be based on an iterative search to match the FXSPR0 with 20SBF0 t1t2 as described by SPC This methodology in part relies on the ability of managers to identify what level of acceptable risk should be applied to breaching a LRP WWF recommends that an acceptable precautionary risk level of exceeding a LRP is represented by a value of 10 or less Once this level of risk has been identified WWF supports the SC9 recommendation that the appropriate values of X for each species in the LRP FXSPR0 be calculated using updated assessments WWF acknowledges the complexity of establishing TRPs given the multiple factors that go into their consideration However while TRPs require additional consideration of socioeconomic considerations current understanding of the biological and socioeconomic conditions does not prevent the implementation of sufficiently precautionary interim TRP at this time WWF encourages the WCPFC to consider and recommend a precautionary interim TRP The interim TRP would serve as an advisory benchmark under which a more refined TRP could be established Most significantly all the necessary information to implement such a benchmark TRP currently exists Lastly WWF supports the SC9 recommendation that the WCPFC consider associated early warning or trigger reference points TrRP which would alert the WCPFC that a stock could be approaching a LRP and that appropriate management action may be required WWF continues to strongly urge the WCPFC and subsidiary bodies to formally endorse and adopt LRP TRP and TrRPs The adoption of explicitly determined LRP and TRP for at least the four key tuna species namely SKJ ALB YFT and BET must be considered an absolute priority for the sustainable management of these important resources in the WCPO WWF recommends that the WCPFC Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF

Limit Reference Points and limiting this to a risk level of 10 or less as a precautionary measure6 Tropical Tunas In December 2012 WCPFC9 adopted CMM 201201 in an attempt to address continuing conservation challenges involving bigeye tuna BET7 The WCPCA bigeye catch for 2012 161679 mt represents the highest since 2004 The high bigeye catch in 2012 coincides with the second highest number of associated sets albeit a 1520 reduction on the record high in 2011 Furthermore the number of purse seine vessels in the tropical fishery reached an alltime high 294 vessels and effort both in terms of days fishing and number of sets was the second highest Even the most optimistic interpretation of these results may be characterised by the word failure Therefore a significant reduction in fishing mortality on BET remains elusive and requires additional measures to reduce the fishing mortality on BET While WWF maintains that the policy choices made by WCPFC9 fail to achieve meaningful conservation of BET we believe that there could be substantial improvements to the understanding of the impact of Fish Aggregating Devices FADs if the SC recommends the aggressive pursuit of improved monitoring surveillance and general research involving FADs While there are ongoing efforts within the SPC and PNA to pursue greater understanding of FAD dynamics we believe that the WCPFC should impose measures in support of FAD research aided by monitoring and surveillance mechanisms which could for instance improve the understanding of the impacts on species composition resulting from FAD typesize Geographic location Drift patterns and prevailing currents Ocean depth and depth of FAD materials Proximity to benthic reliefhydrogeographic features While WWF supports precautionary measures to protect vulnerable stocks like BET WWF also believes that a better understanding of FAD dynamics would help inform the additional and alternative targeted measures that the FFA seeks to implement Lastly WWF strongly supports the efforts of the SPC to analyse the impacts of different levels of reductions in the various fishing sectors WWF encourages all CCMs to carefully review the information and analysis provided by the SPC particularly that contained in Tables 2 and 3 of MI WP018 as they engage in an open and transparent deliberative process to determine where reductions in BET catch must be made The WCPFC absolutely must make effective and enforceable reductions of the catch in all sectors to achieve a meaningful conservation impact for BET Most importantly whatever measures the WCPFC selects absolutely must be subject to strong monitoring control and surveillance measures WWF recommends that the WCPFC Establish and support further research and monitoring of FADs Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF POSITION Engage in an open and transparent deliberative process based on the best available scientific information to determine the level of reductions in BET catch necessary to achieve meaningful BET conservation Revise the current Tropical Tunas CMM to achieve substantial reductions in BET mortality Pacifc Bluefin Tuna This year the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC reported that the stock of North Pacific Bluefin is in extremely poor condition The ISC confirmed that overfishing is occurring the stock is heavily overfished and its spawning stock biomass has declined by as much as 96 WWF maintains strong concerns on rebuilding this ecologically sociologically and economically important fishery resource The WCPFC must recommend that fishing mortality on Pacific bluefin be urgently reduced especially on juveniles in order to reduce the risk of recruitment collapse and allow spawning stock to rebuild If sufficient management measures are not adopted fishing should not be allowed to continue on such a depleted stock WWF recommends that the WCPFC Adopt a longterm Pacific bluefin recovery plan candidate limit and target reference points and harvest control rules that are welldefined preagreed and contain mandatory actions for a determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points Remove all exemptions under the current CMM for Pacific Bluefin tuna through a revised CMM201206 Sharks Many shark species in the WCPO including blue sharks remain subject to high levels of fishing mortality that current stock assessment trends suggest could be unsustainable9 Sharks play a critical role in the WCPO marine ecosystem as apex predators and indicators of ecosystem health10 WWF is concerned with shark conservation and sustainability in the WCPFC region as a whole and considers responsible management trade and consumption where shark mortality occurs in all fishing activities not just in circumstances where tuna fishing is occurring Therefore WCPFC must also recognise the needs of coastal States in the WCPFC region to manage their shark populations WWF recommends the WCPFC impose additional measures proposed during SC9 to ensure that sharks generally are not being adversely impacted in the region but also ensuring that some key shark species are not being substantially depleted Therefore we encourage the WCPFC to recommend precautionary measures to reduce fishing mortality consistent with recommendations made at SC9 drawn from the discussion regarding a proposed integrated shark CMM11 By way of reference we endorse the recommendations contained in sections 41 and 42 of the paper presented by Dr Shelley Clarke at SC9 and TCC9 in addition to measures recommended below12 WWF recommends the WCPFC Develop endorse and adopt a Comprehensive Shark CMM that includes efforts to o Mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs o Implement the recommendations for Bycatch that were endorsed at Kobe III and adopt an annually updated report card system against these recommendations for all of the WCPFC fisheries Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF POSITION o Require through data collected from observer programs and other means estimation of the number of captures and releases of all sharks and rays including the status upon release dead or alive and reporting of this information to the WCPFC o Require through observers programs recording what gear is used in longline activities including the use of wire traces and any multi monofilament traces in order to avoid biteoff by sharks o Introduce a scheme to document the capture and trade of sharks whereby it allows for traceability through to the final market state and o Ensure the implementation requirements for CITES listed sharks are fully understood and planned for in preparation for CITES Parties and Non Parties trading with CITES Parties needing to make Nondetriment Sustainability and legal findings in order to issue Export permits for trade in these species by September 201413 Encourage the development of reference points and management for nontarget species including blue sharks as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Silky Sharks At SC8 in Busan Korea the Scientific Services Provider offered strong scientific evidence that silky sharks are currently overfished and subject to overfishing14 Based on a previous SC recommendation the WCPFC subsequently executed efforts to rebuild spawning biomass of oceanic whitetip sharks by adopting CMM 201104 However SC8 recommended additional analysis for silky sharks due to concerns over data conflict and potential biases in the stock assessment despite basic fishery indicators indicating substantial declines in recent years An updated assessment of silky sharks presented to the SC9 strongly confirmed the previous conclusion that overfishing is occurring and the stock is overfished15 Thus the current science strongly suggests that additional mitigation measures to avoid capture and mortality of silky sharks is warranted16 The WCPFC must take supplementary measures to specifically address the continued adverse impacts on silky sharks in addition to general call for improvements in shark management overall With respect to silky sharks WWF recommends the WCPFC Impose additional mitigation measures and maintain existing measures in an effort to improve the status of the WCPO silky shark stock including o mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs o prohibit the retention transhipment storage onboard sale and landing of silky sharks in all fisheries managed by the WCPFC o mandate the prompt and careful release of any captured silky sharks and o require through data collected from observer programs and other means estimation of the number of releases of silky sharks including the status upon release dead or alive and reporting of this information to the WCPFC Encourage the development of reference points and management for nontarget species including silky sharks as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF POSITION Regional Observer Program Information collected as part of an appropriate observer programme is critically important to the proper management of a fishery Data collected by observers plays a central role in informing fisheries scientists on everything ranging from stock assessments to nontarget species impacts Furthermore observers play an indispensable role in monitoring and enforcing very important conservation and management measures in the WCPO Indeed observers represent the vanguard of fisheries management through the science and service that they provide Consequently observer coverage must be considered a top priority and greater support must be provided to the relevant authority to see that the capacity of the ROP is strengthened The WCPFC must ensure through appropriate guidance that national observer programmes administered under the ROP are fully resourced in terms of human and financial capital as well as governed under appropriate administrative and management structures Within that consideration the WCPFC should endorse an analysis that considers and presents not only a costbenefit analysis of the observer programme in the context of proper management but also different funding models that CCMs could consider for ensuring proper administration and management of the observer program at a national level In any event more attention must be given to the development and full funding of minimum standards that ensure a national programme can perform to ROP standards including such efforts as annual reviews of the national programs under preagreed performance standards Additionally WWF continues to maintain significant concerns regarding the independence of onboard observers from the perspective of data integrity The independence and the security of the observer must be paramount to ensure data integrity Therefore WWF recommends that any observer funding model considered must avoid even the perception of conflict of interest This means establishing a 3rd party payment system that insulates the observer from direct payment by the vessel owner or operator which constitutes an unequivocal financial conflict of interest Specifically WWF believes that a Prepayment Model that would require funding observer placement through an independent 3rd party agent like an escrow account could potentially provide the necessary insulation from undue influence by the vessel owner or operator while also ensuring that the observer is properly paid and transported to their home of record at the conclusion of their service Thus WWF recommends that the WCPFC research funding models that ensure that observer providers can provide timely and secure payments to observers without having those payments made directly to the observer by the vessel owner or operator WWF generally supports current efforts throughout the WCPO in pursuit of Electronic Monitoring EM Other fisheries around the world have demonstrated varying levels of success using EM in limited circumstances depending on the goal of the observation and data collection program Therefore each application of EM is contextual and must be subject to thorough analysis comprehensive testing and careful monitoring to ensure the technology and program is functioning as designed WWF would like to acknowledge the important role that EM could potentially play in ensuring observer coverage throughout the WCPFC CA possibly even at a reduced cost but noting that there will always be a need for human observers to perform certain analytical tasks that a camera sensor or computer simply cannot accomplish WWF recommends that the WCPFC establish a peer review process for the various EM programs in progress or currently planned for implementation in the WCPO Lastly WWF acknowledges and supports the establishment of the Regional Observer Programme Independent Working Group ROPIWG and the continued work toward improving the ROP including consideration of observer health safety and welfare as well as technical data collection issues With respect to the ROP WWF recommends the WCPFC Further implementation of a binding consistent and consolidated set of standards for the ROP Develop an analysis of the observer programme in the context of proper management including an analysis of different funding models Sample

comprehensive catch documentation scheme CDS is a necessary part of a wellmanaged fishery Good catch documentation is essential to proper fisheries management providing the data necessary for analyses as basic as stock assessments to the product traceability that seafood markets are increasingly demanding WWF supports the development and implementation of a comprehensive CDS and supports the

considered by the WCPFC must be fully comprehensive to be effective including documentation of all catches landings transfers and trade Other RFMOs provide relevant examples of CDS schemes that were not robust enough to provide adequate documentation For instance the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna CCSBT switched from a purely tradebased scheme to a more comprehensive CDS

of an appropriate observer programme be critically important to the proper management of a fishery datum collect by observer play a central role in inform fishery scientist on everything range from stock assessment to nontarget species impact furthermore observer play an indispensable role in monitoring and enforce very important conservation and management measure in the wcpo indeed observer represent the vanguard of fishery management through the science and service that they provide consequently observer coverage must be consider a top priority and great support must be provide to the relevant authority to see that the capacity of the rop be strengthen the wcpfc must ensure through appropriate guidance that national observer programme administer under the rop be fully resource in term of human and financial capital as well as govern under appropriate administrative and management structure within that consideration the wcpfc should endorse an analysis that consider and present not only a costbenefit analysis of the observer programme in the context of proper management but also different funding model that ccms could consider for ensure proper administration and management of the observer program at a national level in any event more attention must be give to the development and full funding of minimum standard that ensure a national programme can perform to rop standard include such effort as annual review of the national program under preagreed performance standard additionally wwf continue to maintain significant concern regard the independence of onboard observer from the perspective of data integrity the independence and the security of the observer must be paramount to ensure data integrity therefore wwf recommend that any observer funding model consider must avoid even the perception of conflict of interest this mean establish a 3rd party payment system that insulate the observer from direct payment by the vessel owner or operator which constitute an unequivocal financial conflict of interest specifically wwf believe that a prepayment model that would require funding observer placement through an independent 3rd party agent like an escrow account could potentially provide the necessary insulation from undue influence by the vessel owner or operator while also ensure that the observer be properly pay and transport to their home of record at the conclusion of their service thus wwf recommend that the wcpfc research funding model that ensure that observer provider can provide timely and secure payment to observer without have those payment make directly to the observer by the vessel owner or operator wwf generally support current effort throughout the wcpo in pursuit of electronic monitoring em other fishery around the world have demonstrate vary level of success use em in limited circumstance depend on the goal of the observation and datum collection program therefore each application of em be contextual and must be subject to thorough analysis comprehensive testing and careful monitoring to ensure the technology and program be function as design wwf would like to acknowledge the important role that em could potentially play in ensure observer coverage throughout the wcpfc ca possibly even at a reduce cost but note that there will always be a need for human observer to perform certain analytical task that a camera sensor or computer simply can not accomplish wwf recommend that the wcpfc establish a peer review process for the various em program in progress or currently plan for implementation in the wcpo lastly wwf acknowledge and support the establishment of the regional observer programme independent working group ropiwg and the continue work toward improve the rop include consideration of observer health safety and welfare as well as technical datum collection issue with respect to the rop wwf recommend the wcpfc further implementation of a bind consistent and consolidated set of

you Mr Chairman for giving us the floor and express our gratitude to the Government of Australia for hosting this 10th Regular Session of WCPFC in Cairns The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora CITES is a legally binding international agreement between 179 countries including many members cooperating nonmembers and participating territories to this Commission The interaction of CITES with regional fisheries management organizations such as WCPFC has taken on new significance with the CITES listing of several shark species that fall under the purview of the Commission At the 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES CoP16 in Bangkok in March 2013 and because they met specific trade and biological listing criteria Porbeagle shark Lamna nasus Oceanic whitetip shark Carcharhinus longimanus Scalloped hammerhead shark Sphyrna lewini Great hammerhead shark S mokarran and Smooth hammerhead shark S zygaena as well as all manta rays Manta spp were included in CITES Appendix II meaning that international trade is strictly regulated and controlled to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival but is not prohibited The entry into effect of these listings has been delayed by 18 months until 14 September to enable CITES Parties to resolve technical and administrative issues related to their implementation From 14 September 2014 onward any international trade in specimens of these species will need to be accompanied by CITES permits and certificates confirming that they have been harvested sustainably and legally and this trade will also need to be reported to the CITES Secretariat The collaboration between CITES authorities and fishery agencies at national and regional levels will be essential for the effective implementation of these requirements and this will need to get assistance where required National and regional fishery management agencies and organizations have the main responsibility for managing fishery resources including sharks and rays CITES as a global instrument for regulating international trade in listed wild species can complement fishery management to encourage fishery stakeholders managers and fishers alike to implement and follow sustainable and legal fishing practices for international commercial trade Good fishery management measures based on the best scientific information available play a major role in the implementation of CITES requirements for international trade in commerciallyexploited aquatic species To effectively implement the CITES CoP16 decisions for the 5 sharks and the manta rays the involvement of and support for a widerange of stakeholders will be needed The response to this challenge has been remarkable with a flurry of activities being put in place since March 2013 for which we are particularly grateful Just to name a few Australia and New Zealand Brazil China and Germany as well as several NGOs are planning regional capacity building workshops dealing with specific aspects of the CITES shark listings identification 2 materials are being developed targeted needs assessments are being made guidelines to determine that proposed trade levels are sustainable are being established and the European Union and the USA amongst others have pledged financial support for assisting these and other efforts The CITES Secretariat is also committed to assist CITES Parties especially developing countries in being able to comply with the CITES requirements by 14 September 2014 The European Union has generously provided 12 million Euro to the CITES Secretariat to enhance the implementation of the legally binding CITES regulatory measures for sharks We are closely cooperating with the FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department in this initiative Our joint actions are aimed at enhancing the efforts of regional fisheries management organizations and at developing countries that are key shark fishing nations which need to

please visit httpwwwISSFOUNDATIONorg CMM 201301 bigeye and skipjack tuna The analyses presented at SC10 corroborate the fact that CMMs adopted by WCPFC to end the overfishing of bigeye have been ineffective Overfishing continues and the stock is now below the Limit Reference Point adopted by the Commission The purse seine fishery continues to increase with record catches in 2013 when the bigeye catch by this gear was clearly the highest ever In addition the longline fishery has a similar impact on the reproductive capacity of the stock as the purse seine fishery does Overall fishing mortality on the stock needs to be reduced by 36 in order to end overfishing CMM201301 is overly complex and has too many exemptions and optional clauses which render it ineffective and difficult to enforce The WCPFC could consider adding other incremental measures to the CMM such as extending the FAD closure period limiting the number of FAD sets made each year or the number of FADs that each vessel uses but this is what has been done since 2009 and it is clearly not effective ISSF urges the WCPFC to eliminate the exemptions in the CMM and to adopt management measures that are effective and easier to enforce such as a total fishery closure potentially with two closure periods or a reduction in fishing effort to meet the objective of ending the overfishing of the bigeye stock Regarding skipjack tuna the stock is within the range of the candidate Target Reference Points TRP being considered by WCPFC and SC10 recommended that fishing mortality on the stock not be allowed to increase from its current level ISSF urges WCPFC to limit fishing effort fishing days in the purse seine fishery to a lower level that will maintain skipjack within the range of candidate TRPs and significantly reduce the catch of bigeye Harvest Control Rules HCRs and Reference Points HCRs are a set of welldefined management actions to be taken in response to changes in stock status with respect to target and limit reference points ISSF endorses the application of the Precautionary Approach using clear target and limit reference points and HCRs as called for by the UN Fish Stocks Agreement and by some RFMO Conventions In 2012 the WCPFC adopted limit reference points for skipjack bigeye yellowfin and South Pacific albacore This was an important first step Now the WCPFC needs to adopt harvest strategies including target reference points and harvest control rules for these same stocks ISSF looks forward to substantial progress on adoption of target reference points and HCRs for skipjack at WCPFC11 through the adoption of the proposed work plan for the development and implementation of target reference points and HCRs Compliance and Data Gaps ISSF notes with concern the SC10 information about the lack of operational data for longline fleets in the high seas which affected the quality of the bigeye assessment reported at SC10 ISSF strongly urges all CCMs to meet their obligations regarding data submissions and provide these operational data to the SPC by the agreed deadlines and in the correct formats ISSF further urges the Commission to consider appropriate responses to promote compliance by those CCMs who have not yet provided operational catch and effort data While there were important strides in 2013 ISSF continues to be concerned with the lack of transparency in the WCPFC Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS In contrast to the other four tuna RFMOs observers are not allowed in the CMS working group meetings and the responses of members to identified noncompliance are not released publically Member reports on the implementation of WCPFC measures known as Part II reports are also confidential ISSF urges the Commission to endorse TCC10s recommendation to amend CMM 201302 to reform its CMS process so that accredited observers may attend the working group meetings and information on how CCMs respond to and plan to address the areas of identified non compliance be made public ISSF also supports the development of a scheme of responses to noncompliance by the Commission as soon as possible Fish Aggregating Device FAD Management Setting on FADs accounts for nearly 40 of global tuna catches and 50 of global skipjack catches FADs are one of the most important fishing methods for tropical tunas However there are huge gaps in all TRFMOs regarding the number of FADs being used and on details of fishing operations on individual FADs Observer programs can be used to collect much but not all of the information needed to appropriately monitor FADs as shown in WCPFCSC102014STIP09 The WCPFC has adopted Minimum Standard Data Fields for observers that contain much of this information However there are some types of information that an observer is unlikely or unable to collect such as FAD markings or details on the FAD design This is information that vessel captains can easily collect but observers cannot do so routinely ISSF urges the WCPFC to take two actions this year 1 ensure that the regional observer program routinely collects the FAD data in the WCPFC Minimum Standard Fields and 2 expand the information required from vessels to include data on FAD deployments designs equipment and identification marks ISSF strongly supports the SC10 and TCC10 recommendations for the creation of a Working Group on FAD management ISSF urges the Working Group to adopt Terms of Reference that address i FAD marking and identification and use of electronic signatures and ii FAD monitoring tracking and control Transparency in Access Joint Venture and Chartering Arrangements ISSF recognizes the importance of access and chartering or joint venture arrangements to the development aspirations of developing States in particular small island developing States It is also equally important for accurate stock assessments and effective compliance and enforcement that there is clarity regarding catch attribution and the responsible party for MCS regarding vessels under chartering or access arrangements ISSF urges the WCPFC to adopt measures to promote transparency in access agreements and chartering or joint venture arrangements that are similar to existing IOTC and ICCAT measures Sharks SC10 recommended that WCPFC11 consider a number of longline shark mitigation methods WCPFCSC10EBWP01 ISSF notes that shark lines are used in many fisheries and these catch mostly silky and oceanic whitetip sharks Since the retention of these species is prohibited ISSF urges WCPFC to prohibit the use of shark lines in order to improve compliance ISSF is encouraged that FFA USA and the EU are seeking the adoption of a comprehensive and robust shark conservation and management measures that includes the removal of the fintoweight ratio which was highlighted at TCC10 as being an area of noncompliance ISSF supports amending CMM 201007 to mandate that fins remain naturally attached for all sharks landed Moreover the CMM should include the implementation of a range of proven shark catch mitigation measures improved data collection and reporting and the development of stockspecific reference points Longlining and Transshipment ISSF notes with concern the low levels of observer coverage data indicates that coverage rates may be less than the required 5 and the failure of some CCMs to provide the required transshipment reports or advance notifications ISSF notes that electronic monitoring systems are being tested and developed which could potentially be used to address some of these problems ISSF urges WCPFC11 to impose and enforce as a precautionary measure measures to limit longliner capacity in the Convention Area ISSF also urges the Commission to task its scientific body to make recommendations to WCPFC12 regarding the levels of longline capacity consistent with sustainable exploitation and prudent management of target tuna stocks ISSF further urges the Commission to amend its transshipment measure CMM 06 in order to address these significant gaps in its effectiveness which affect traceability of the products and could result in IUU fishing Closed Vessel Registries and Management of Fleet Capacity Experts agree that there is overcapacity in the global tuna fleets Fishing fleet overcapacity increases pressure to weaken management measures and eventually leads to stock overexploitation ISSF continues to be concerned with the growth of fishing capacity in the WCPO region which has not been curtailed through the provisions adopted in CMM 201301 To underscore this importance of this issue in October ISSF clarified its Resolution to Limit the Growth in Fishing Capacity of the Global LargeScale Tropical Tuna Purse Seine Fleet Through this Resolution ISSF Participating Companies must refrain from transactions in skipjack bigeye and yellowfin tuna caught by large scale1 purse seine vessels that are not actively fishing for tuna or under contract for construction as of December 31 2012 or a replacement for an existing vessel ISSF urges the WCPFC to establish limited entry through closed vessel registries and to develop a common currency to measure fishing capacity such as cubic meters of well volume ISSF also supports the Kobe III call for creating mechanisms to transfer capacity to developing countries These steps should be taken now since scaling back purse seine fleet capacity will become even more difficult as new vessels are introduced Given the importance of a mechanism to transfer capacity to developing countries to any regional capacity management scheme ISSF hosted a Workshop in March 2014 to start a For the purpose of this resolution largescale purse seine vessels are those at least 335 m3 fish hold volume

WCPFC11-2014-OP10,3.0,The World Wide Fund for Nature WWF would like to again thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC for the opportunity to attend the 11th Regular Session as an observer and to address the critically important role that it plays in the proper management of the Western Central Pacific Ocean WCPO fisheries WWF once again calls on members of the WCPFC to address the issues and recommendations raised at SC10 TCC10 and WCPFC10 as well as observe the experience of other RFMOs in their own efforts to achieve and maintain improved measures for monitoring and surveillance WWF wishes to reiterate its position offered in Cairns in December 2013 WCPFC10 and taking into account the WCPFCrelated meetings held since the recommendations listed below as well as other documents submitted to the WCPFC for review as Observer Papers WWF remains supportive of the work of the WCPFC and subsidiary bodies in pursuing the implementation of Reference Points RP Harvest Control Rules HCR and Harvest Strategies HS Consistent with previous WWF position statements and recommendations WWF encourages the WCPFC11 to develop and implement the adoption of explicit Limit and Target Reference Points LRPTRP HCRs and HSs for all WCPO fishery stocks under WCPFC authority Therefore WWF welcomes the proposal by Australia for a CMM on establishing a harvest strategy for key tuna species in the WCPO We support the approach that the draft CMM will seek the Commissions agreement to formally develop a HS approach to fisheries for the major tuna stocks under the Commissions purview with a goal toward achieving individual harvest strategies for specific fisheries developed in accordance with this CMM that in turn set out the management actions necessary to achieve defined biological economic and social objectives for each fishery If WCPFC11 takes appropriate action on this CMM it will provide a sufficient framework for moving forward management in a methodical way to result in valid and effective LTRPs and HCRs WWF strongly commends the initiative of the PNA to establish and implement a TRP for the SKJ stock in PNA waters WWF also supports Japans development of an alternative CMM for an SKJ TRP Gregg Yan WWF WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 11th Regular Session Apia Samoa 15 December 2014 recently presented for review by the WCPFC Both proposals present valuable perspectives and strong commitments to sustainability and precaution We encourage a robust discussion about the proposed levels for the TRPs in the different proposals and upon compromising and selecting a candidate TRP at this meeting support the application of that TRP throughout the WCPO Lastly WWF notes the SC10 and TCC10 support for the analyses of these important management measures as well as their recommendation that WCPFC11 take the results of the papers presented at this meeting into consideration when considering the adoption of TRPs and HCRs for the key target species WWF recommends that the WCPFC Adopt and implement the proposed CMM on Establishing a Harvest Strategy for Key Tuna Species in the WCPO Adopt and Implement a CMM consistent with proposed recommendations on a TRP for Skipjack Tuna at a level of 050SSBF0t1t2 or higher Support the continued development and implementation of LRPs and TRPs as a priority for proper management of all stocks Support interim precautionary TRPs as a benchmark for further consideration by the WCPFC in 2014 and Support the continued development and implementation of HCRs that ensure the transparent and efficient management of stocks in relation to LRPs and TRPs Many shark species in the WCPO remain subject to high levels of fishing mortality that current stock assessment trends suggest could be unsustainable Sharks play a critical role in the WCPO marine ecosystem as apex predators and indicators of ecosystem health WWF is concerned with shark conservation and sustainability in the WCPFC region as a whole and considers responsible management trade and consumption where shark mortality occurs in all fishing activities not just in circumstances where tuna fishing is occurring Therefore WCPFC must also recognise the needs of coastal States in the WCPFC region to manage their shark populations WWF recommends the WCPFC adopt and implement measures proposed during 2013 to ensure that sharks stocks are not adversely impacted in the region while also ensuring that some key shark species are not being substantially depleted Therefore we encourage the WCPFC to adopt precautionary measures to reduce fishing mortality consistent with recommendations made previously by the SC and drawn from the discussion regarding a proposed integrated shark CMM By way of reference we again endorse the recommendations contained in sections 41 and 42 of the paper presented by Dr Shelley Clarke to the WCPFC in 2013 in addition to measures recommended below WWF recommends the WCPFC Adopt and implement a Comprehensive Shark CMM that includes efforts to o Mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs o Implement the recommendations for bycatch that were endorsed at Kobe III and adopt an annually updated report card system against these recommendations for all of the WCPFC fisheries o Require through data collected from observer programs and other means estimation of the number of captures and releases of all sharks and rays including the status upon release dead or alive and reporting of this information to the WCPFC o Require through observers programs recording what gear is used in longline activities including the use of wire traces and any multi monofilament traces in order to avoid biteoff by sharks WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 11th Regular Session Apia Samoa 15 December 2014 o Introduce a scheme to document the capture and trade of sharks whereby it allows for traceability through to the final market state and o Ensure the implementation requirements for CITES listed sharks are fully understood and planned for in preparation for CITES Parties and Non Parties trading with CITES Parties needing to make Nondetriment Sustainability and legal findings in order to issue export permits for trade in these species by September 2014 Where WCPFC members make nondetriment findings for shark species they should share with the WCPFC details of the basis of those findings Encourage the development of reference points and management for nontarget species including all shark species as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Encourage CCMs to report all shark catches from domestic fleets operating in territorial and archipelagic waters In December 2013 WCPFC10 adopted yet another measure CMM 201301 in an attempt to address continuing conservation challenges involving bigeye tuna BET The WCPCA bigeye catch for 2013 158662 mt was only slightly lower than in 2012 The provisional purse seine catch estimate for bigeye tuna for 2013 82151 mt was the highest on record The record high bigeye tuna catch in 2013 coincides with a continuation of high effort levels and elevated bigeye tuna catch rates for all set types The number of purse seine vessels in the tropical fishery remains at an alltime high 297 vessels and total effort in terms of fishing days estimated from logbook data and VMS data was also highest Fishing mortality is currently 157 times that which will support the maximum sustained yield As a result the BET stock is now at 16 of its historic biomass and is experiencing overfishing and overfished Once again even the most optimistic interpretation of these results may be characterised by the word failure While WWF maintains that the policy choices made repeatedly by the WCPFC fail to achieve meaningful conservation of BET we believe that there could be substantial improvements to the understanding of the impact of Fish Aggregating Devices FADs through the aggressive pursuit of improved monitoring surveillance and general research involving FADs followed by appropriately targeted limits or management measures While there are ongoing efforts within the SPC and PNA to pursue greater understanding of FAD dynamics we believe that the WCPFC should impose measures in support of FAD research aided by monitoring and surveillance mechanisms which could for instance improve the understanding of the impacts on species composition resulting from FAD typesize Geographic location Drift patterns and prevailing currents Ocean depth and depth of FAD materials Proximity to benthic reliefhydrogeographic features The WCPFC absolutely must make effective and enforceable reductions of the catch in all sectors to achieve a meaningful conservation impact for BET Most importantly whatever measures the WCPFC selects absolutely must be subject to strong monitoring control and surveillance measures WWF recommends that the WCPFC Establish and support further research and monitoring of FADs Engage in an open and transparent deliberative process based on the best available scientific information to determine the level of reductions in BET catch necessary to achieve meaningful BET conservation Revise the current Tropical Tunas CMM to achieve substantial reductions in BET mortality WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 11th Regular Session Apia Samoa 15 December 2014 Technical reports of both the ISC and the IATTC indicate that the North Pacific Bluefin tuna stock is in extremely poor condition The ISC confirmed that overfishing is occurring the stock is heavily overfished and its spawning stock biomass has declined by as much as 96 This is a clear indicator that the management measures taken both in the Western and Central Pacific and in the Eastern Pacific are proving insufficient to conserve the biological integrity of this stock The IATTC and WCPFC must assume their share of responsibility WWF maintains strong concerns regarding this stock with an aim of restoring and rebuilding this ecologically sociologically and economically important fishery resource The current science strongly indicates that there is only one reproductive cohort that is reaching the end of its life Additionally about 90 of the stock fished are young fish that have not yet reproduced Thus the continued reproductive success of the entire stock depends on the reproductive success of a single cohort leaving the stock in a critical situation that may seriously jeopardize recruitment If the WCPFC fails to adopt sufficient management measures the stock will be subject to potential collapse Should the WCPFC fail to adopt sufficient management measures that are consistent with scientific advice the fishery could ultimately be subject to more draconian management measures such as extended closed seasons and areas until such time that managers can prepare a rigorous and scientifically defensible recovery plan The WCPFC consistent with the best scientific information must adopt and implement measures that urgently reduce fishing mortality on Pacific bluefin tuna especially on juveniles in order to reduce the risk of recruitment collapse and allow spawning stock to rebuild If sufficient management measures cannot be agreed the WCPFC must recommend that fishing should not be allowed to continue on such a depleted stock WWF recommends that the WCPFC Adopt the CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURE TO ESTABLISH A MULTIANNUAL REBUILDING PLAN FOR PACIFIC BLUEFIN TUNA agreed by NC10 and recommend to WCPFC11 Adopt a longterm Pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan candidate limit and target reference points and harvest control rules that are welldefined preagreed and contain mandatory actions for a determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference

WCPFC11-2014-OP11,4.0,Summary Greenpeace welcomes the opportunity to attend the 11th meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC as an observer The outcome of the recent WCPFC Science Committee meeting in particular the poor state of bigeye and Pacific bluefin stocks is the predictable result of the failure of members of this Commission to uphold the mandate stipulated under Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention to apply the precautionary approach including through acting upon the best available scientific advice in adopting conservation and management measures CMMs for key tuna species1 The overfishing occurring on these critical tuna stocks is a direct result of the continued expansion of fishing fleets increasing fishing capacity and effort through the use of FADs in particular and increasing noncompliance Two of the Pacifics vital tuna stocks are now at dangerously low levels the Pacific bluefin tuna population is estimated to be at 43 and bigeye tuna at 16 of its original spawning biomass2 The Commission must prioritise efforts towards rebuilding these stocks While the other tuna species skipjack yellowfin and albacore are at somewhat higher biomass levels there are warning signs that all three of these stocks are also in trouble from observed localised depletion or range contraction of skipjack and yellowfin to widespread economic deterioration of domestic fisheries for South Pacific albacore The commission cant afford to be the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff and must develop precautionary targets and harvest control rules to restore all the fisheries in its mandate to full health and productivity Greenpeace therefore calls on the members of the WCPFC to urgently adopt the following measures Ensure full compliance with data provision requirements as a fundamental basis for the work of the Commission and agree on decreased fishing opportunities in 2015 for those parties failing to comply with these provisions Greenpeace welcomes the FFA proposal for a Conservation and Management Measure for the Provision of Operational Level Data by all CCMs and hopes that WCPFC parties will go further and act strongly on this fundamental issue Greenpeace urges China Japan Korea and Taiwan to remedy their noncompliance on this issue Adopt interim target reference points TRPs of 50 SBF0 for skipjack bigeye and yellowfin and 70 for albacore until final TRPs are agreed by the Commission no later than 2017 Greenpeace supports the FFA proposed replacement for the conservation and management measure on

WCPFC11-2014-OP11,7.0,Violation of the convention nonprovision of operational level data Commission members agreed 10 years ago to cooperate including through the provision of necessary data as an obligation to being a party to the Convention To date four CCMs namely China Japan Korea and Taiwan continue to withhold data on the operations of their fleets in the high seas This is an unacceptable situation that undermines the work of the scientific community and the credibility of management advice made available to the Commission and thwarts efforts to combat IUU fishing In summary it makes a mockery of this Commission This is a serious breach in the obligations of CCMs as stipulated under article 5b article 5i of the Convention The first meeting of the Scientific Committee of the Commission in 2005 concluded that access to operational level data was absolutely necessary to interpret historical changes in the longline fishery and recommended data rules including standards for operational data that were adopted by WCPFC2 CCMs have now had nine years in which to address any domestic legal constraints to apply these measures and there is simply no plausible excuse for any CCM that has failed to do so The Commission must ensure full compliance with data provision requirements as a fundamental basis for its work and agree on decreased fishing opportunities in 2015 for those parties failing to comply with these provisions Article 20 of the Convention gives guidance to the Commission exercising its decisionmaking provisions in order to improve CCM compliance Article 10 Paragraph 3 e of the Convention requires the Commission to take into account data provision by CCMs in determining criteria for the allocation of TACs or TAEs The Commission should also look at the option of imposing mandatory regional observer coverage as a mitigating measure to gather the necessary operational data Greenpeace supports the adoption of the FFA proposal for a Conservation and Management Measure for the Provision of Operational Data Target Reference Points and Harvest Control Rules The Commission agreed to use a hierarchical 3level framework to define appropriate limit reference points LRPs for stocks based on the level of biological information available For skipjack albacore yellowfin and bigeye tunas and striped marlin the current agreed biomass limit reference point is 20 SBF0 based on recruitment conditions for the most recent 10 years of assessment excluding the final year of assessment when recruitment is poorly estimated The Commission has also since decided not to adopt an equivalent Fbased reference point as this was seen as redundant given the adoption of a biomassbased LRP The continued failure of current CMMs to address the issue of increasing capacity and declining stocks adds urgency to the need to adopt TRPs and harvest control rules These TRPs must ensure at a minimum a low risk of stocks dropping below the biomass LRPs The majority of CCMs at SC8 recommended that the low risk level for stocks dropping above these LRPs should be 10 for yellowfin and bigeye and 5 for albacore and skipjack However in some cases such as in considering the economic viability of the Pacific Island albacore fleets a higher TRP is indicated For example two papers presented at SC10 showed that for south Pacific albacore There is a 5 risk of LRP being breached if the goal is to maintain the stock at 59 SBF0 and 10 risk if the stock is maintained at 55 SBF0 Both these levels are below the current level 63 SBF0 where some south Pacific longline fleets are already struggling to make a living3 The biomass of albacore that will provide the MEY for albacore is estimated to be much higher that the level required to maintain the MEY4 For these reasons Greenpeace is urging the Commission to Adopt interim target reference points TRPs of 50 SBF0 for skipjack bigeye and yellowfin and 70 SBF0 for albacore until final TRPs are agreed by the Commission no later than 2017 Greenpeace supports the FFA proposed replacement for the conservation and management measure on establishing a harvest strategy for key tuna species in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean,violation of the convention nonprovision of operational level datum commission member agree 10 year ago to cooperate include through the provision of necessary datum as an obligation to be a party to the convention to date four ccms namely china japan korea and taiwan continue to withhold datum on the operation of their fleet in the high sea this be an unacceptable situation that undermine the work of the scientific community and the credibility of management advice make available to the commission and thwart effort to combat iuu fish in summary it make a mockery of this commission this be a serious breach in the obligation of ccms as stipulate under article 5b article 5i of the convention the first meeting of the scientific committee of the commission

WCPFC11-2014-OP12,3.0,Recommendations to the 11th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission5 December 2014 Apia Samoa A brief from Nov 2014 The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission is responsible for managing all highly migratory fish stocks including tuna and sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean Although it was established over a decade ago by a convention based on relatively modern principles of fisheries management the Commissions management of these stocks continues to be inadequate The worlds largest tuna fishery has been fished unsustainably in contradiction to strong scientific and management advice and fishing capacity continues to grow Today 50 more largescale purse seine vessels are fishing these waters than 10 years ago and two of the six commercial tuna stocks in the Convention Area are classified as overfished The Commission must take steps to ensure that the fisheries under its jurisdiction are managed responsibly and sustainably Ensuring healthy fisheries in this region requires strong conservation and management actions and strict compliance The Pew Charitable Trusts calls on all Commission Members Cooperating nonMembers and Participating Territories known collectively as CCMs to cooperate and compromise in order to End overfishing rebuild overfished populations of tuna and strengthen management to ensure ongoing sustainability Adopt conservation and management measures to protect sharks and other vulnerable species Strengthen measures to end illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing and ensure compliance by increasing the transparency of fishing operations and the accountability of CCMs Richard Hermann Turn around tuna management In 2013 several records were broken by the still growing western and central Pacific tuna fishery which last year accounted for 57 percent of the global tuna catch The haul of skipjack tuna was the largest on record 18 million metric tons and the purse seine catch of bigeye tuna reached an alltime high 82151 metric tons More than percent of individual bigeye were captured as small juveniles on fish aggregating devices FADs helping to diminish the future spawning potential of the population1 One of the factors driving these catch records is capacity creep New purse seine vessels are entering the fishery and the technology associated with drifting FADshumanmade floating objects that attract fishis evolving rapidly This leads to more tunaand non tuna species attracted to the FADsbeing caught in a fishing day and makes clear the need for management to adapt to and account for these changes With onethird of the commercially exploited tuna populations in these waters in need of rebuilding critical actions must be taken now to ensure the future of the fishery CCMs must implement target and limit reference points for all tuna populations adopt a robust rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin and effectively limit the catch of small bigeye in the FAD fishery Adopt and implement target and limit reference points To reverse concerning declines in some species and to prevent others from suffering similar fates the Commission should rapidly fulfill its obligation to develop and implement target and limit reference points for all tuna species An agreement on harvest control rules must be reached to ensure that limits are not exceeded and overall objectives of the fishery are achieved This year the Commissions Scientific Committee has recommended steps to avoid further increases in fishing mortality for skipjack and to maintain this stock near current levels The Parties to the Nauru Agreement and Tokelau are developing a target reference point for skipjack equivalent to twice the biomass that would produce maximum sustained yield Members of the Forum Fisheries Agency are proposing the adoption of a harvest strategy approach that would specify timelines for the adoption of reference points and harvest control rules for South Pacific albacore and skipjack and establish a process for doing so for other stocks This work is supported by civil society some industry members and the scientific community which have called on WCPFC to tighten purse seine controls and adopt target reference points and harvest control rules Given the broad support and increasing threats to the tuna populations WCPFC should adopt a target reference point for the skipjack fishery this year and agree on a process to implement reference points and harvest control rules for all tuna species Take concrete steps to rebuild Pacific bluefin or suspend the fishery The 2014 stock assessment update for Pacific bluefin tuna conducted by the International Scientific Committee ISC found that the population remains severely depleted at just 4 percent of its unfished biomass As part of the assessment the ISC analyzed the potential effects of seven catch scenarios Only one predicted significant population growth under current recruitment conditions which define the potential productivity of the population and therefore its ability to grow At its 2014 meeting the WCPFC Northern Committee recommended a measure that would implement shortterm catch cuts in line with the ISC analysis but the committee could agree only to a year rebuilding target of 8 percent of historic biomass As such the population will remain severely depleted at best for at least another decade WCPFC should call on the Northern Committee to revisit and strengthen the rebuilding target for Pacific bluefin tuna at its 2015 meeting and to cooperate with the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission on Pacificwide management measures that will rebuild the Pacific bluefin tuna population to at least 25 percent of its historic biomass within 10 years Rebuild the bigeye population and adopt FAD set limits The 2014 stock assessment determined that fisheries in the western and central Pacific have reduced the bigeye tuna population to 16 percent of its unfished biomass This level threatens the viability of the fishery and urgent action is needed to rebuild this population Clearly current management measures are not effective and a new approach to limiting bigeye catch is critical Temporary FAD closures aimed at reducing the mortality of small bigeye tuna in purse seine FAD sets have proved ineffective Even with longer FAD closuresfrom two months in to four months more recentlythe catch of bigeye by purse seine vessels has reached new highs Because more than 90 percent of individual bigeye caught on FADs are juveniles that have not had a chance to reproduce the future of the fishery is bleak To effectively limit the purse seine catch of bigeye the Scientific Committee recommended FAD set limits but they have not been adopted fully by the Commission This year WCPFC delegates can improve management of the purse seine fishery by adopting FAD set limits in line with the scientific advice that calls for a 36 percent reduction in fishing mortality from 200811 average levels A 2012 study showed that FAD fishing can be effectively tracked and monitored because the vast majority of the drifting devices have satellite beacons As a first step the WCPFC should work with CCMs that have built FAD monitoring systems in order to verify FAD sets across the Convention Area Ending bigeye overfishing is not a technological or scientific challenge The information and tools exist It is a matter of political will With more vessels fishing in the region and with continuing developments in FAD technology the WCPFC must act to protect the future of this billiondollar fishery WCPFC should amend CMM 201301 to further reduce bigeye tuna mortality across all fishing gears and in particular should replace ineffective FAD closures with FAD set limits in line with the scientific advice Stop the influx of fishing vessels and the rise in FAD use Purse seine capacity continues to increase A record 297 vessels fished in the western and central Pacific in Even more 305 vessels are expected to fish in 2014 In addition technological developments are leading to increases in the number of FADs used and their efficiency These factors are driving increases in catch across a range of target and nontarget species and current management measures cannot account for these efficiency gains This jeopardizes the future of western and central Pacific tuna fisheries and is an issue that the Commission can and should take action on this year As specified by CMM 201301 parties other than small island states agreed to submit to the 11th Regular Session of the WCPFC a scheme to reduce capacity to the level of 31 December 2012 These schemes should include reductions in the numbers of vessels in use and FADs deployed Strengthening conservation and management of sharks Every year about 100 million sharks are caught and killed in commercial fisheries an unsustainable number2 Whether this catch is unintended unwanted or highly sought after the impact on ocean ecosystems demands urgent action Until measures are in place to ensure that the targeted and incidental catch of sharks is sustainable their capture with fishing gear should be avoided and they should be released alive whenever possible Gear that increases the likelihood of shark catch such as wire leaders and shark lines should be prohibited and research should be undertaken to determine the best means of avoiding shark catch If WCPFC members are to continue to target sharks or retain shark bycatch the precautionary principle must be taken into account and management measures must ensure that all shark catches in the Convention Area are sustainable WCPFC fisheries must not contribute to the global overfishing of sharks that has led to severe declines wherever they are found A conservation and management measure for sharks A dedicated conservation and management measure CMM to reduce shark mortality is urgently needed to ensure that robust and enforceable measures are in place to protect sharks caught in fisheries covered by the convention In 2013 and 2014 the Scientific Committee highlighted continuing concerns over the effectiveness of and compliance with existing shark conservation and management measures Meeting reports noted the impact of continued use of wire leaders and shark lines to target sharks in longline fisheries the lack of observer coverage in those fisheries and the limited effectiveness of CMM 201007 in eliminating shark finning In 2013 the Ninth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee noted Given the current growing public concern over global shark overexploitation most CCMs consider that there is a need for the WCPFC to adopt more robust and enforceable measures for sharks to reduce mortality in both the longline and purseseine fisheries In line with this advice the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency tabled an important measure to reduce and control shark mortality at the 10th Regular Session of the WCPFC in 2013 CCMs could not reach a consensus on the proposal and it was not adopted WCPFC cannot delay taking action A new CMM must be adopted that ensures that shark catches are either mitigated through bans on wire leaders and shark lines or managed in line with precautionary scientific advice to ensure species sustainability Enforcing existing shark measures CMMs 201308 and 201104 prohibit the retention of oceanic whitetip and silky sharks These overfished species require drastic mortality reductions if they are to recover The measures mandate that all CCMs release any oceanic whitetip and silky sharks caught in the Convention Area as soon as possible after a shark is brought alongside a vessel and that it be done in a manner that results in as little harm to the shark as possible Pew strongly supports recent actions by the Republic of the Marshall Islands to effectively enforce CMM 201308 by prosecuting a vessel that retained silky sharks Pew encourages all CCMs to do the same WCPFC11 should analyze implementation of CMM 201308 and 201104 and ensure that all CCMs comply with their obligations under these measures for purse seine and longline fleets Blue sharks Blue sharks are caught in targeted fisheries and as bycatch in WCPFC fisheries Nearly 40000 metric tons have been caught annually over the last three years in the North Pacific alone Still no management measures are in place to control this catch and ensure sustainability The 10th Regular Session of the Scientific Committee in Karin Leonard assessed the status of the North Pacific blue shark stock and noted that there is significantsubstantial uncertainty associated with the level of current fishing mortality from the target fishery for blue shark and the ongoing sustainability of the stock WCPFC11 must ensure that precautionary sciencebased management measures are adopted for North Pacific blue sharks to ensure that both targeted fisheries and bycatch for this species are sustainable The status of blue sharks in the South Pacific remains unclear It should be a priority to ensure that the status of South Pacific blue sharks is fully understood so appropriate effective management can be put in place Data collection Efforts to assess shark stock status in the western and central Pacific make clear that data recording and reporting on the catch of shark species is limited and that this information gap significantly hampers development of comprehensive scientific advice The WCPFC should adopt a no data no fish measure for sharks similar to the measure put in place by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas This would prevent CCMs from retaining or landing any of the 14 key shark species identified by WCPFC if they had not submitted landing data on any catch of that species from the previous year Enhance CCMs transparency and accountability As in other parts of the world IUU fishing remains a threat in the WCPFC Convention Area The Commission has taken important steps to improve compliance with its management measures but the WCPFC cannot do its job effectively unless it requires complete transparency from all CCMs and imposes serious consequences for any lack of compliance with these requirements To further limit IUU fishing the Commission should Adopt minimum standards for port inspections Port State measures or PSMs are costeffective tools to monitor compliance with management arrangements and prevent illegal fish from entering the market WCPFC has repeatedly considered adoption of such measures and the WCPFC performance review has recommended their adoption3 Following steps taken at its 10th Regular Session the Commission should formally agree to the development of a regional scheme of PSMs by adopting minimum standards for port inspections and providing adequate support to developing States for their implementation Harmonize WCPFC vessel records and improve transparency WCPFC substantially enhanced the ability to identify fishing vessels in its waters by agreeing last year to mandate that all vessels weighing at least 100 gross tons or 100 gross registered tons have International Maritime Organization numbers Moreover the WCPFC secretariat has continued to improve its Record of Fishing Vessels by making it more informative and userfriendly To ensure greater transparency of fishing operations additional vessel information should be included in the Record The Commission should require that as of 1 January 2016 CCMs provide to the secretariat information on any enforcement action taken on vessels operating in the Convention Area as soon as the information becomes available This information should be published as part of the Record Enhance the effectiveness of the IUU vessel list Placing a vessel on WCPFCs IUU vessel list is a necessary step to highlight and deter unacceptable practices in the Convention Area The effectiveness of this list is diminished however because IUU vessels can be added only once a year As a result these vessels are able to operate unhindered until the Commission meets and agrees to list them At the same time the WCPFC permits the removal of vessels from its IUU vessel list intersessionally CCMs should establish a procedure that allows IUU vessels to be listed between sessions The IUU vessel list also should be updated continuouslywhenever a vessel changes its name flag or other characteristic Ban transshipment at sea Transshipment at sea continues to be an opportunity to avoid proper catch reporting and to launder illicitly caught fish Transshipment at sea should not be allowed to occur until it can be ensured that these operations do not contribute to IUU fishing This would require having a robust monitoring system that ensures full transparency mandating observers andor fisheries officers on board the offloading and receiving vessels and complete oversight by the Commission of all

the 11th regular session of the western and central pacific fisheries commission5 december 2014 apia samoa a brief from nov 2014 the western and central pacific fisheries commission be responsible for manage all highly migratory fish stock include tuna and shark in the western and central pacific ocean although it be establish over a decade ago by a convention base on relatively modern principle of fishery management the commissions management of these stock continue to be inadequate the world large tuna fishery have be fish unsustainably in contradiction to strong scientific and management advice and fishing capacity continue to grow today 50 more largescale purse seine vessel be fish these water than 10 year ago and two of the six commercial tuna stock in the convention area be classify as overfished the commission must take step to ensure that the fishery under its jurisdiction be manage responsibly and sustainably ensure healthy fishery in this region require strong conservation and management action and strict compliance the pew charitable trusts call on all commission member cooperate nonmembers and participating territories know collectively as ccm to cooperate and compromise in order to end overfishe rebuild overfished population of tuna and strengthen management to ensure ongoing sustainability adopt conservation and management measure to protect shark and other vulnerable specie strengthen measure to end illegal unreported and unregulated iuu fishing and ensure compliance by increase the transparency of fishing operation and the accountability of ccms richard hermann turn around tuna management in 2013 several record be break by the still grow western and central pacific tuna fishery which last year account for 57 percent of the global tuna catch the haul of skipjack tuna be the large on record 18 million metric ton and the purse seine catch of bigeye tuna reach an alltime high 82151 metric ton more than percent of individual bigeye be capture as small juvenile on fish aggregate device fad help to diminish the future spawning potential of the population1 one of the factor drive these catch record be capacity creep new purse seine vessel be enter the fishery and the technology associate with drift fadshumanmade float object that attract fishis evolve rapidly this lead to more tunaand non tuna specie attract to the fadsbeing catch in a fishing day and make clear the need for management to adapt to and account for these change with onethird of the commercially exploit tuna population in these water in need of rebuild critical action must be take now to ensure the future of the fishery ccm must implement target and limit reference point for all tuna population adopt a robust rebuilding plan for pacific bluefin and effectively limit the catch of small bigeye in the fad fishery adopt and implement target and limit reference point to reverse concern decline in some specie and to prevent other from suffer similar fate the commission should rapidly fulfill its obligation to develop and implement target and limit reference point for all tuna specie an agreement on harvest control rule must be reach to ensure that limit be not exceed and overall objective of the fishery be achieve this year the commissions scientific committee have recommend step to avoid further increase in fishing mortality for skipjack and to maintain this stock near current level the parties to the nauru agreement and tokelau be develop a target reference point for skipjack equivalent to twice the biomass that would produce maximum sustained yield member of the forum fisheries agency be propose the adoption of a harvest strategy approach that would specify timeline for the adoption of reference point and harvest control rule for south pacific albacore and skipjack and establish a process for do so for other stock this work be support by civil society some industry member and the scientific community which have call on wcpfc to tighten purse seine control and adopt target reference point and harvest control rule give the broad support and increase threat to the tuna population wcpfc should adopt a target reference point for the skipjack fishery this year and agree on a process to implement reference point and harvest control rule for all tuna specie take concrete step to rebuild pacific bluefin or suspend the fishery the 2014 stock assessment update for pacific bluefin tuna conduct by the international scientific committee isc find that the population remains severely deplete at just 4 percent of its unfished biomass as part of the assessment the isc analyze the potential effect of seven catch scenario only one predict significant population growth under current recruitment condition which define the potential productivity of the population and therefore its ability to grow at its 2014 meeting the wcpfc northern committee recommend a measure that would implement shortterm catch cut in line with the isc analysis but the committee could agree only to a year rebuilding target of 8 percent of historic biomass as such the population will remain severely deplete at good for at least another decade wcpfc should call on the northern committee to revisit and strengthen the rebuilding target for pacific bluefin tuna at its 2015 meeting and to cooperate with the interamerican tropical tuna commission on pacificwide management measure that will rebuild the pacific bluefin tuna population to at least 25 percent of its historic biomass within 10 year rebuild the bigeye population and adopt fad set limit the 2014 stock assessment determine that fishery in the western and central pacific have reduce the bigeye tuna population to 16 percent of its unfished biomass this level threaten the viability of the fishery and urgent action be need to rebuild this population clearly current management measure be not effective and a new approach to limit bigeye catch be critical temporary fad closure aim at reduce the mortality of small bigeye tuna in purse seine fad set have prove ineffective even with long fad closuresfrom two month in to four month more recentlythe catch of bigeye by purse seine vessel have reach new high because more than 90 percent of individual bigeye catch on fad be juvenile that have not have a chance to reproduce the future of the fishery be bleak to effectively limit the purse seine catch of bigeye the scientific committee recommend fad set limit but they have not be adopt fully by the commission this year wcpfc delegate can improve management of the purse seine fishery by adopt fad set limit in line with the scientific advice that call for a 36 percent reduction in fishing mortality from 200811 average level a 2012 study show that fad fishing can be effectively track and monitor because the vast majority of the drift device have satellite beacon as a first step the wcpfc should work with ccm that have build fad monitoring system in order to verify fad set across the convention area end bigeye overfishing be not a technological or scientific challenge the information and tool exist it be a matter of political will with more vessel fish in the region and with continue development in fad technology the wcpfc must act to protect the future of this billiondollar fishery wcpfc should amend cmm 201301 to far reduce bigeye tuna mortality across all fishing gear and in particular should replace ineffective fad closure with fad set limit in line with the scientific advice stop the influx of fishing vessel and the rise in fad use purse seine capacity continue to increase a record 297 vessel fish in the western and central pacific in even more 305 vessel be expect to fish in 2014 in addition technological development be lead to increase in the number of fad use and their efficiency these factor be drive increase in catch across a range of target and nontarget specie and current management measure can not account for these efficiency gain this jeopardize the future of western and central pacific tuna fishery and be an issue that the commission can and should take action on this year as specify by cmm 201301 party other than small island state agree to submit to the 11th regular session of the wcpfc a scheme to reduce capacity to the level of 31 december 2012 these scheme should include reduction in the number of vessel in use and fad deploy strengthen conservation and management of shark every year about 100 million shark be catch and kill in commercial fishery an unsustainable number2 whether this catch be unintended unwanted or highly seek after the impact on ocean ecosystem demand urgent action until measure be in place to ensure that the targeted and incidental catch of shark be sustainable their capture with fishing gear should be avoid and they should be release alive whenever possible gear that increase the likelihood of shark catch such as wire leader and shark line should be prohibit and research should be undertake to determine the good mean of avoid shark catch if wcpfc member be to continue to target shark or retain shark bycatch the precautionary principle must be take into account and management measure must ensure that all shark catch in the convention area be sustainable wcpfc fishery must not contribute to the global overfishing of shark that have lead to severe decline wherever they be find a conservation and management measure for shark a dedicated conservation and management measure cmm to reduce shark mortality be urgently need to ensure that robust and enforceable measure be in place to protect shark catch in fishery cover by the convention in 2013 and 2014 the scientific committee highlight continue concern over the effectiveness of and compliance with exist shark conservation and management measure meeting report note the impact of continue use of wire leader and shark line to target shark in longline fishery the lack of observer coverage in those fishery and the limited effectiveness of cmm 201007 in eliminate shark fin in 2013 the ninth regular session of the scientific committee note give the current grow public concern over global shark overexploitation most ccms consider that there be a need for the wcpfc to adopt more robust and enforceable measure for shark to reduce mortality in both the longline and purseseine fishery in line with this advice the pacific islands forum fisheries agency table an important measure to reduce and control shark mortality at the 10th regular session of the wcpfc in 2013 ccms could not reach a consensus on the proposal and it be not adopt wcpfc can not delay take action a new cmm must be adopt that ensure that shark catch be either mitigate through ban on wire leader and shark line or manage in line with precautionary scientific advice to ensure species sustainability enforcing exist shark measure cmm 201308 and 201104 prohibit the retention of oceanic whitetip and silky shark these overfished specie require drastic mortality reduction if they be to recover the measure mandate that all ccms release any oceanic whitetip and silky shark catch in the convention area as soon as possible after a shark be bring alongside a vessel and that it be do in a manner that result in as little harm to the shark as possible pew strongly support recent action by the republic of the marshall islands to effectively enforce cmm 201308 by prosecute a vessel that retain silky shark pew encourage all ccm to do the same wcpfc11 should analyze implementation of cmm 201308 and 201104 and ensure that all ccm comply with their obligation under these measure for purse seine and longline fleet blue shark blue shark be catch in target fishery and as bycatch in wcpfc fisherie nearly 40000 metric ton have be catch annually over the last three year in the north pacific alone still no management measure be in place to control this catch and ensure sustainability the 10th regular session of the scientific committee in karin leonard assess the status of the north pacific blue shark stock and note that there be significantsubstantial uncertainty associate with the level of current fishing mortality from the target fishery for blue shark and the ongoing sustainability of the stock wcpfc11 must ensure that precautionary sciencebase management measure be adopt for north pacific blue shark to ensure that both target fishery and bycatch for this specie be sustainable the status of blue shark in the south pacific remain unclear it should be a priority to ensure that the status of south pacific blue shark be fully understand so appropriate effective management can be put in place data collection efforts to assess shark stock status in the western and central pacific make clear that datum recording and reporting on the catch of shark specie be limited and that this information gap significantly hamper development of comprehensive scientific advice the wcpfc should adopt a no datum no fish measure for shark similar to the measure put in place by the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas this would prevent ccm from retain or land any of the 14 key shark specie identify by wcpfc if they have not submit landing datum on any catch of that specie from the previous year enhance ccms transparency and accountability as in other part of the world iuu fishing remain a threat in the wcpfc convention area the commission have take important step to improve compliance with its management measure but the wcpfc can not do its job effectively unless it require complete transparency from all ccms and impose serious consequence for any lack of compliance with these requirement to far limit iuu fish the commission should adopt minimum standard for port inspection port state measure or psm be costeffective tool to monitor compliance with management arrangement and prevent illegal fish from enter the market wcpfc have repeatedly consider adoption of such measure and the wcpfc performance review have recommend their adoption3 follow step take at its 10th regular session the commission should formally agree to the development of a regional scheme of psm by adopt minimum standard for port inspection and provide adequate support to develop states for their implementation harmonize wcpfc vessel record and improve transparency wcpfc substantially enhance the ability to identify fishing vessel in its water by agree last year to mandate that all vessel weigh at least 100 gross ton or 100 gross register ton have international maritime organization number moreover the wcpfc secretariat have continue to improve its record of fishing vessels by make it more informative and userfriendly to ensure great transparency of fishing operation additional vessel information should be include in the record the commission should require that as of 1 january 2016 ccm provide to the secretariat information on any enforcement action take on vessel operate in the convention area as soon as the information become available this information should be publish as part of the record enhance the effectiveness of the iuu vessel list place a vessel on wcpfc iuu vessel list be a necessary step to highlight and deter unacceptable practice in the convention area the effectiveness of this list be diminish however because iuu vessel can be add only once a year as a result these vessel be able to operate unhindered until the commission meet and agree to list they at the same time the wcpfc permit the removal of vessel from its iuu vessel list intersessionally ccms should establish a procedure that allow iuu vessel to be list between session the iuu vessel list also should be update continuouslywhenever a vessel change its name flag or other characteristic ban transshipment at sea transshipment at sea continue to be an opportunity to avoid proper catch reporting and to launder illicitly catch fish transshipment at sea should not be allow to occur until it can be ensure that these operation do not contribute to iuu fish this would require have a

WCPFC11-2014-OP15,16.0,Managing fisheries on the basis of MSY is an excessively riskprone approach As such we suggest that WCPFC adopt a target objective above BMSY to compensate for biological environmental and data uncertainties Many recreational fisheries are catch and release in nature where anglers prefer to catch more and bigger fish than to necessarily harvest fish In addition to its inherent uncertainty managing stocks on the level of MSY not only reduces the abundance of fish but also their average size Maintaining stocks at higher abundances benefits recreational anglers that release their fish and also contributes to the substantial economic value of these fisheries We feel this is especially true with bycatch species such as marlin and sailfish that have little commercial value but great economic value to recreational anglers,manage fishery on the basis of msy be an excessively riskprone approach as such we suggest that wcpfc adopt a target objective above bmsy to compensate for biological environmental and datum uncertaintie many recreational fishery be catch and release in nature where angler prefer to catch more and big fish than to necessarily harvest fish in addition to its inherent uncertainty manage stock on the level of msy not only reduce the abundance of fish but also their average size maintain stock at high abundance benefit recreational angler that release their fish and also contribute to the substantial economic value of these fishery we feel this be especially true with bycatch specie such as marlin and sailfish that have little commercial value but great economic value to recreational angler,Bycatch

WCPFC11-2014-OP17,1.0,ELEVENTH REGULAR SESSION Faleata Sports Complex Apia SAMOA 5 December 2014 SPREP Statement WCPFC112014OP17 December 201430 Prepared By SPREP PO Box 240 Apia Samoa E sprepspreporg T 685 21929 The Pacific environment sustaining our livelihoods and natural heritage in harmony with our cultures STATEMENT TO THE 11TH SESSION OF THE WESTERN CENTRAL PACIFIC FISHERIES COMMISSION BY THE SECRETARIAT FOR THE PACIFIC REGIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME SPREP Mr Chairman Honourable Ministers Distinguished Delegates On behalf of the DirectorGeneral of SPREP I should like to extend our thanks for the opportunity to address the meeting As you know SPREP is not a regular participant in the meetings of the WCPFC but as the only regional agency based here in Samoa and one that takes a great interest in the deliberations of the Commission we are delighted to be able to participate in this weeks discussions As the Pacific regional agency for the environment SPREP is recognized as the lead on 4 key areas biodiversity and ecosystems climate change waste management and pollution and environmental monitoring and governance in the Pacific Region We focus on strengthening partnerships and cooperation among Pacific Island countries territories on these areas Environmental management protection is SPREPs priority focus Sustainable management of marine habitats and resources is at the core of our mission Tuna are not the only migratory marine species to feature extensively in Pacific Island cultures and history Whales dolphins turtles and sharks are also iconic species and additionally they provide an increasingly economically valuable niche for Pacific Island countries in the growing ecotourism market SPREP is engaged in a number of projects to conserve and protect endangered and threatened species and to provide an economic benefit for those coastal communities involved as guardians for these emblematic species However the populations of many species of cetaceans turtles and sharks in the region are at historically low levels and many are critically endangered or endangered often through by catch from commercial fishing Migratory species are particularly vulnerable because their journeys between breeding grounds and feeding grounds often take them through the EEZs of various Pacific Island countries and international waters Efforts made to promote protection and conservation within EEZs can be nullified unless similar measures are taken on the high seas Sharks are highly valued in the Pacific Islands and this has been reflected in recent years by the declaration of shark sanctuaries in many countries such as Palau the Marshall Islands and Tokelau the introduction of bans on shark finning in the EEZs of many other countries and the leadership role taken by several countries in signing the Convention on Migratory Species MoU on migratory sharks SPREP is very concerned at the impacts of both targeted take and bycatch of sharks in the regions tuna fisheries and SPREP members which include all Pacific island countries and territories have requested that SPREP develop a Shark Action Plan It has become clear that many species of pelagic sharks have been overfished in recent years most notably silky sharks and oceanic whitetips SPREP has been working closely with several of its member countries to improve the protection afforded to a number of shark species in the region through the Convention on Migratory Species and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species We are hopeful that the Commission will this week agree to pass a new Conservation Management Measure that will effectively address the problem of shark bycatch and targeted catch in both longline and purseseine fisheries SPREP is also committed to working with the Commission other regional agencies and stakeholders to better understand the extent and significance of bycatch of turtles and cetaceans in both longline and purseseine fisheries and to the development of mitigation measures SPREP has recently become more actively engaged in the problem of marine debris and its impacts on marine megafauna and is currently sponsoring a research programme on the provenance and distribution of plastic and other debris in the Pacific Islands region and will be contributing to UNEPs Global Marine Litter Campaign In that regard SPREP is concerned about the possible impacts of drifting FADs on turtles and other migratory species and is anxious to learn more from this weeks meeting We also seek to work closely with all fishing fleets and Pacific Island states to improve the regions port facilities for the reception of damaged nets and other fishing gear and to encourage all vessels to retain their nondegradable waste on board for safe disposal on shore SPREP supports and promotes the establishment of Marine Protected Areas both large and small which present tremendous opportunities for Pacific Islands to improve the resilience and conservation of biodiversity in the face of increasing threats from climate change and overexploitation Although most Pacific Islands have small land masses they are in fact Large Ocean States with jurisdiction over nearly of the global ocean Many Pacific Island Governments such as Kiribati Cook Islands and New Caledonia have in recent years declared very large MPAs within their EEZs SPREP believes that well managed MPAs can play an important role in protecting pelagic fisheries from overexploitation while also protecting other important ecosystem services including carbon sequestration resilience for coral reefs and other marine biodiversity from the impacts of global warming coastal protection from storms and replenishment of local fisheries The issue of climate change is of enormous concern to all Pacific Island States Ocean acidification caused by rising levels of carbon dioxide in the ocean is a clear and growing threat to the regions pelagic tuna fisheries as well as coastal fisheries and coral reef structure throughout the region In association with the Governments of the USA and New Zealand SPREP convened a workshop on ocean acidification immediately prior to the recent SIDS conference here in Apia This workshop noted the adverse effects of increasing acidification on the survival of yellowfin tuna larvae SPREP will continue to be strongly engaged in developing a monitoring network for ocean acidification within the Pacific Islands region and welcomes the support of Pacific Island governments members of the Commission regional organisations and other stakeholders in this initiative Pacific Island nations are uniquely dependent on the Ocean and can rightly claim to be at the forefront of global efforts to improve sustainable management and conservation of marine resources SPREP is committed to a leadership role for Pacific communities in the preservation of their iconic marine fauna for future generations and looks forward to an increasing collaboration with the Commission and its members and other stakeholders to achieve this,eleventh regular session faleata sports complex apia samoa 5 december 2014 sprep

WCPFC12-2015-OP02,5.0,WWF POSITIONth Regular Session of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC Bali Indonesia December 38 2015 Introduction The World Wide Fund for Nature WWF would like to again thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC for the opportunity to attend the 12th Regular Session as an observer and to address the critically important role that it plays in the proper management of the Western Central Pacific Ocean WCPO fisheries WWF once again calls on members of the WCPFC to address the issues and recommendations raised at SC11 TCC11 and WCPFC11 as well as observe the experience of other RFMOs in their own efforts to achieve and maintain improved measures for monitoring and surveillance WWF would like to note that this Position Statement is not comprehensive but that fact does not mean that WWF does not think that other issues not included herein are not important WWF wishes to reiterate its position offered in Apia Samoa in December 2014 WCPFC11 and taking into account the WCPFCrelated meetings held since the recommendations listed below as well as other documents submitted to the WCPFC for review as Observer Papers Reference Points Harvest Control Rules and Harvest Strategies WWF remains supportive of the work of the WCPFC and subsidiary bodies in pursuing the implementation of Reference Points RP Harvest Control Rules HCR and Harvest Strategies HS Consistent with previous WWF position statements and recommendations WWF encourages the WCPFC12 to develop and implement the adoption of explicit Target Reference Points TRPs HCRs and HSs for all WCPO fishery stocks under WCPFC authority Therefore WWF welcomes CMM 201406 to develop and implement a harvest strategy approach for key fisheries and stocks in the WCPO We support the approach that the CMM seeks the Commissions agreement to formally develop a HS approach to fisheries for the major tuna stocks under the Commissions purview with a goal toward achieving individual harvest strategies for specific fisheries developed in accordance with this CMM that in turn set out the management actions necessary to achieve defined biological economic and social objectives for each fishery If WCPFC12 takes appropriate action on this CMM and recommendations from the Harvest Strategy Workshop HSW it will provide a sufficient framework for moving forward management in a methodical way to Gregg Yan WWF POSITION DECEMBER Smart Fishing Initiative WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 12th Regular Session Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 result in valid and effective RPs and HCRs as well as a formalised Management Strategy Evaluation MSE process WWF strongly commends the initiative of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement PNA to establish and implement a TRP for the SKJ stock in PNA waters WWF also supports the Pacific Island Forum Fisheries Agencys FFA development of CMM for a TRP for South Pacific albacore SPA recently presented for review by the WCPFC Both proposals present welldefined scientificallybased and strong commitments to sustainability and precaution We strongly encourage the Commission to adopt these TRPs for implementation throughout the WCPO Lastly WWF notes the SC11 and TCC11 support for the analyses of these important management measures as well as their recommendation that WCPFC12 take the results of the papers presented at this meeting into consideration when considering the adoption of TRPs and HCRs for the key target species WWF recommends that the WCPFC Adopt and implement the proposed timelines and recommendations for fully implementing CMM 201406 Adopt and Implement a CMM consistent with proposed recommendations on a TRP for skipjack tuna at a level of 050SSBF0t1t2 Adopt and Implement a CMM consistent with proposed recommendations on a TRP for South Pacific albacore Tuna at a level of 045SSBF0 Support the continued development and implementation of LRPs and TRPs as a priority for proper management of all stocks Support interim precautionary TRPs as a benchmark for further consideration in all other stocks managed by the WCPFC in 2015 and Support the continued development and implementation of HCRs that ensure the transparent and efficient management of stocks in relation to LRPs and TRPs Sharks and Rays Many shark species in the WCPO remain subject to high levels of fishing mortality that current stock assessment trends suggest could be unsustainable1 Sharks play a critical role in the WCPO marine ecosystem as apex predators and indicators of ecosystem health2 WWF is concerned with shark conservation and sustainability in the WCPFC region as a whole and considers responsible management trade and consumption where shark mortality occurs in all fishing activities not just in circumstances where tuna fishing is occurring Therefore WCPFC must also recognise the needs of coastal States in the WCPFC region to manage their shark populations Although WWF supports the minor action taken by the WCPFC in CMM 201405 Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks3 WWF continues to support recommendations made previously by the SC and drawn from the discussion regarding a proposed comprehensive and integrated shark CMM4 By way of reference we again endorse the recommendations contained in sections 41 and 42 of the paper previously presented by Dr Shelley Clarke in addition to measures recommended below5 Furthermore WWF endorses the recent action taken by the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC to support best practices for safe handling and release manta rays genus Mobula and Manta aboard purse seiners Consistent with additional calls from CCMs during the SC11 meeting WWF encourages the WCPFC to pursue equivalent or consistent measures for mantas in the WCPFC Convention Area WWF recommends the WCPFC Develop endorse and recommend adoption of a Comprehensive Shark CMM that includes efforts to o Mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 12th Regular Session Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 o Implement the recommendations for bycatch that were endorsed at Kobe III and adopt an annually updated report card system against these recommendations for all of the WCPFC fisheries o Require through data collected from observer programs and other means estimation of the number of captures and releases of all sharks and rays including the status upon release dead or alive and reporting of this information to the WCPFC o Require through observer programs recording what gear is used in longline activities including the use of wire traces and any multi monofilament traces in order to avoid biteoff by sharks o Introduce a scheme to document the capture and trade of sharks whereby it allows for traceability through to the final market state and consider the recommendations included in the TRAFFIC report produced for the CITES Secretariat when developing such a scheme and o Ensure the implementation requirements for CITES listed sharks are undertaken by CITES Parties and NonParties trading with CITES Parties where they are required to make nondetriment and legal findings in order to issue export permits for trade in these species6 Where WCPFC members make nondetriment findings for shark species they should share with the WCPFC details of those findings so that the WCPFC Secretariat can provide information to the CITES Standing Committee working group on sharks before January 7 Develop endorse and recommend safe handling and release practices for manta rays genus Mobula and Manta aboard purse seiners Encourage the development of reference points and management for nontarget species including all shark and ray species as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Encourage CCMs to report all shark and ray catches from domestic fleets operating in territorial and archipelagic waters and Endorse recommendations made in EBWP03 EBIP05 EBWP06 and EBWP submitted for SC11 including introducing safe handling practices for whale sharks Rhincodon typus caught within WCPFC purse seine fisheries and Revise and amend the shark reporting processes to WCPFC to streamline shark related data and to close data gaps Sea Turtles WWF supports the recent intervention at TCC11 by the United States requesting renewed focus on sea turtle bycatch in the WCPO tuna fisheries WWF continues to believe that CMM 200803 for the Conservation and Management of Sea Turtles has not demonstrably reduced bycatch impacts on threatened and endangered sea turtles in the region The cumulative impact of increasing numbers of longline vessels in the WCPO on sea turtles remains problematic and there has been insufficient uptake of proven bycatch mitigation measures such as circle hook andor finfish bait All 6 species of sea turtles in the WCPO remain threatened or endangered With no evidence of CMM 200803 having slowed or reversed negative trends on threatened and endangered sea turtle populations the burden of proof remains on the WCPFC to demonstrate that sea turtle bycatch impacts in tuna operations are being minimized and to take stronger measures if they are not being minimized WWF believes that there exists a strong basis for revising CMM 200803 to 1 ensure more suitable requirements for the determination of optimal bycatch mitigation packages ie circle hooks andor other measures such as finfish bait for individual fisheries 2 reduce the ambiguity in language and 3 improve the definition of the desired outcomes of the CMM Moreover evidence suggests that the WCPFC and member states have not suitably monitored the CMM for effectiveness with some parts of the CMM distinguished as providing excessive room for creative compliance8 While CMM 200803 requires all longline vessels to carry turtle dehookers and line cutters WCPFC has provided no WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 12th Regular Session Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of this requirement and only a small fraction of member countries have conducted dedicated research on sea turtle mitigation techniques9 Indeed as recently as 2010 over three quarters of CCMs either did not report on compliance with CMM 200803 or did not meet all the CMM measures Furthermore only a small fraction of member countries have conducted dedicated research on sea turtle mitigation techniques and current observer coverage falls well below the recommended level for effectively determining optimal mitigation approaches ie 10 coverage over 3 years The precautionary principle requires that all CCMs must determine optimal bycatch mitigation strategies based on research and sound science Most importantly WWF believes that the WCPFC should reconsider CMM 200803 in light of new information available regarding fisheries impacts on sea turtles and the impacts of various mitigation measures on turtle bycatch10 Specifically recent studies in the Eastern Pacific Ocean as well as atsea trials by WWF in Vietnam and Papua New Guinea further confirm the positive impact of turtle bycatch mitigation using circle hooks thereby indicating a need for further consideration and adoption of circle hooks in the WCPO longline fisheries11 WWF recommends the WCPFC Consider and develop revisions of CMM 20083 aimed at o reducing the ambiguity in language strengthening key language and reducing the vagueness in desired outcomes of the CMM thereby enabling better monitoring of CMM effectiveness o introducing new binding measures for the use of circle hooks in all longline fleets exempted only if an equally effective solution for the mortality of sea turtles can be demonstrated o introducing stronger measures for conducting research on mitigation techniques and reporting on sea turtle impacts as a means of determining optimal mitigation packages for individual fleets and o setting an appropriate interim catch rate that would trigger moveon provisions Encourage member state involvement and participation in the research conducted under the analysis of sea turtle mitigation measure effectiveness in tuna longline fisheries described in EBWP05 presented at SC11 Tropical Tunas WWF maintains that the policy choices made repeatedly by the WCPFC fail to achieve meaningful conservation of BET WWF also believe that there could be substantial improvements to the understanding of the impact of Fish Aggregating Devices FADs through the aggressive pursuit of improved monitoring surveillance and general research involving FADs followed by appropriately targeted limits or management measures While there are ongoing efforts within the SPC and PNA to pursue greater understanding of FAD dynamics we believe that the WCPFC should impose measures in support of FAD research aided by monitoring and surveillance mechanisms which could for instance improve the understanding of the impacts on species composition resulting from FAD typesize Geographic location Drift patterns and prevailing currents Ocean depth and depth of FAD materials Proximity to benthic reliefhydrogeographic features The WCPFC absolutely must make effective and enforceable reductions of the catch in all sectors to achieve a meaningful conservation impact for BET Most importantly whatever measures the WCPFC selects absolutely must be subject to strong monitoring control and surveillance measures WWF recommends that the WCPFC Establish and support further research and monitoring of FADs WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 12th Regular Session Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 Engage in an open and transparent deliberative process based on the best available scientific information to determine the level of reductions in BET catch necessary to achieve meaningful BET conservation and Revise the current Tropical Tunas CMM to achieve substantial reductions in BET mortality Regional Observer Programme Information collected as part of an appropriate observer programme is critically important to the proper management of a fishery Data collected by observers plays a central role in informing fisheries scientists on everything ranging from stock assessments to nontarget species impacts Furthermore observers play an indispensable role in monitoring and enforcing very important CMMs in the WCPO Indeed observers represent the vanguard of fisheries management through the science and service that they provide Consequently observer coverage and the safety and security of those observers must be considered a top priority and greater support must be provided to the relevant authority to see that the capacity of the ROP is strengthened Observer Programme Management and Administration The WCPFC must ensure through appropriate guidance that national observer programmes administered under the ROP are fully resourced in terms of human and financial capital as well as governed under appropriate administrative and management structures Within that consideration the WCPFC must contemplate different funding models that CCMs may consider for ensuring proper administration and management of the observer program at a national level including those that incorporate sustainable financing through a valid and functional cost recovery system The WCPFC has given inadequate consideration to the necessary resourcing of one of the most critical parts of fisheries management in the region the national and regional observer programmes Urgent attention must be given to the development and full funding of minimum standards that ensure a national programme can perform to ROP standards including such efforts as continued annual reviews of the national programs under preagreed performance standards as well as continued regular training for all regional and national observer programme staff Observer Coverage on Longline Vessels WWF notes that observer coverage on longline vessels operating in the WCPO regardless of the metrics used to calculate it remains substantially less than 5 regionwide Moreover WWF wishes to point out that the 5 observer coverage value identified by the WCPFC represents an arbitrary benchmark that was never intended to represent an end goal but rather a minimum starting point toward appropriate observer coverage Even a consistently applied level of 5 coverage is statistically and practically useless for most management or monitoring control and surveillance MCS purposes Therefore WWF supports efforts to improve the observer coverage of all longline fisheries in the WCPO As such WWF supports calculating observer coverage according to the proposed hierarchy of four metrics for assessing observer coverage but notes that best practice would be to use number of hooks deployed as an appropriate metric If other metrics for calculating coverage are used terms must be very clearly defined in advance and each metric must be calculated in a way to be comparable to the other metrics WWF also notes that different levels of observer coverage may be required for management or compliance purposes depending on specific identified objectives and recommends that appropriate analyses be conducted to determine each of those levels respectively in the context of identified objectives Most importantly the WCPFC must demand that the ROP and national observer programmes receive full funding and support to ensure their continued operation and that the level of observer coverage on longline vessels be increased immediately to achieve management and compliance objectives WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 12th Regular Session Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 Transhipment Monitoring Transhipment remains one of the most prominent weaknesses in catch documentation and verification that leads to Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU catch in the WCPO WWF notes that the most simple efficient and effective solution to the challenges of transhipmentrelated IUU is to simply prohibit all atsea transhipment and require all fishing vessels to land their catch at the nearest available designated port in the WCPO following the conclusion of fishing activity However acknowledging that a prohibition on transhipment is unlikely at this point WWF supports an unequivocal 100 observer monitoring requirement for all transhipments WWF further encourages the Commission to consider the recommendations of the IWGROP to adopt the proposed amendments to CMM 200906 to establish additional reporting requirements for receiving vessels operating in the Convention Area12 WWF also supports the guidelines and suggested format for reporting to the Secretariat although WWF would also encourage the development of fully electronic templates13 Most importantly WWF strongly recommends that due to the prominent compliance monitoring role of transhipment observers that they receive twoway communication devices described in the following section as a matter of urgent priority WWF also recommends that transhipment requirements be buttressed by verification and validation of transhipment activities through the use of a vessel monitoring system VMS and supplemented by an operating automated identification system AIS If through investigation of suspected unreported transhipment activity indicated by VMS and corroborated by AIS it is determined that transhipment activity was conducted in violation of transhipment rules the offending vessel should be subject to sanctions up to and including listing on the IUU vessel blacklist Observer Safety and Security In the course of their official duties observers are vulnerable to assault obstruction resistance delay intimidation or interference which are all very clear violations under CMM 200701 Attachment K Annex 1 Paragraph 1i Thus observer providers and authorities have a discrete obligation to address alleged violations reported by observers quickly and effectively When national or regional observer programmes and other authorities fail to address these reported violations effectively and in a timely manner it signals to the observer that providers either do not care or are incapable of providing support for their welfare Moreover the failure of providers or the national authorities to act on a report has an additional effect of signalling to vessel captains and crew that they may conduct violations against observers without retribution Following recent tragedies involving observers both in the WCPFC and IATTC Convention areas the WCPFC must urgently address observer safety and security standards The WCPFC must immediately adopt standards that include the means for an observer to independently report or otherwise signal in real time any emergency including interference or assault Currently available technology could allow direct and independent communication between observers and observer providers Many of the devices also operate as a waterproof Personal Locator Beacons PLBs in cases of an accidental overboard situation Furthermore observer programmes must also urgently adopt an Emergency Action Plan EAP that designates procedures to ensure that observer emergencies can be quickly and effectively responded to by authorities The technology tools are effectively useless to the observer if there is nobody designated to respond on the other end WWF believes that every observer should be issued one of these devices and observer programmes must have a welldefined and effective EAP in place prior to any observer deployment Lastly the WCPFC must also implement a recordkeeping and reporting mechanism that requires any violations against observers to be forwarded to the WCPFC Secretariat Secretariat as soon as possible after the incident has occurred By informing the Secretariat the Secretariat may then alert and potentially coordinate with other observer programmes immediately such as in cases of man overboard situations that require search and recovery coordination The Secretariat could also offer assistance to the programme and the observer where possible as well as provide followup to ensure corrective actions have been taken on behalf of the observer More importantly the Secretariat could WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 12th Regular Session Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 maintain a record of vessels and crewmembers involved in violations against observers which could be made available to observer providers to better assess future placement of observers and avoid potential escalation of threats against observers WWF recommends the WCPFC Further implement of a binding consistent and consolidated set of standards for the ROP Develop an analysis of the observer programme in the context of proper management including an analysis of different sustainable funding models Endorse an analysis of levels of observer coverage required to achieve management or compliance purposes while ensuring that the metrics and methodologies used support development of appropriate comparative analyses Support or endorse the use of VMS and AIS to verify and validate 100 observer coverage on all transhipments as well as supporting strong penalties and sanctions for violations Mandate authorised observer programmes to provide observers before any boarding for a trip o An approved independent two way communication satellite device and o A waterproof personal lifesaving beacon Mandate authorised observer programmes to develop and implement an Emergency Action Plan EAP to accommodate any observer emergency including interference or assault and Mandate recordkeeping and reporting requirements that compel all CCMs to report all instances of violations against of observers as soon as possible to the WCPFC Secretariat Pacific Bluefin Tuna Technical reports of both the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC and the IATTC indicate that the Pacific Bluefin tuna stock is in extremely poor condition The ISC confirmed that overfishing is occurring the stock is heavily overfished and its spawning stock biomass has declined by as much as 9614 This is a clear indicator that the management measures taken both in the Western and Central Pacific and in the Eastern Pacific are proving insufficient to conserve the biological integrity of this stock The IATTC and WCPFC must assume their share of responsibility The last assessment confirms that the stock is highly depleted that fishing mortality exceeds all reasonable proxies for Fmsy The recovery of the stock may be further delayed if the current scenario of low recruitment continues which is heavily reliant on a major adult cohort in the population While the WCPFC adopted conservation measures calling for reductions in catch for Pacific bluefin tuna of 30 kg in size conservation of spawning stocks is also needed WWF maintains deep concerns regarding this stock with an aim of restoring and rebuilding this ecologically sociologically and economically important fishery resource The current science strongly indicates that there is only one reproductive cohort that is reaching the end of its life Additionally about 90 of the stock fished is comprised of young fish that have not yet reproduced Thus the continued reproductive success of the entire stock depends on the reproductive success of a single cohort leaving the stock in a critical situation that may seriously jeopardize recruitment WWF encourages close monitoring of fisheries and catch as well as completion of a revised stock assessment for Pacific bluefin in early 2016 WWF urges both IATTC and WCPFC to adopt a long term Pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan targeting 20SSBF0 and harvest control rules that are well defined preagreed and contain mandatory actions for a determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points The WCPFC consistent with the best scientific information must act to ensure that fishing mortality on Pacific bluefin tuna be urgently reduced especially on juveniles in order to reduce the risk of WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 12th Regular Session Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 recruitment collapse and allow spawning stock to rebuild If the WCPFC fails to adopt sufficient management measures at this meeting it may be forced to consider a prohibition on continued fishing of the stock in the near future WWF recommends that the WCPFC Adopt a longterm Pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan targeting at least 20SSB0 by and Implement a size limit for Pacific bluefin tuna of 30kg to conserve spawning stock in addition to the current temporary management measure

purse seiner encourage the development of reference point and management for nontarget specie include all shark and ray specie as envisage under articles 5 and 10 of the wcpf convention encourage ccm to report all shark and ray catch from domestic fleet operate in territorial and archipelagic water and endorse recommendation make in ebwp03 ebip05 ebwp06 and ebwp submit for sc11 include introduce safe handling practice for whale shark rhincodon typus catch within wcpfc purse seine fishery and revise and amend the shark reporting process to wcpfc to streamline shark relate datum and to close data gap sea turtles wwf support the recent intervention at tcc11 by the united states request renew focus on sea turtle bycatch in the wcpo tuna fishery wwf continue to believe that cmm 200803 for the conservation and management of sea turtles have not demonstrably reduce bycatch impact on threaten and endanger sea turtle in the region the cumulative impact of increase number of longline vessel in the wcpo on sea turtle remain problematic and there have be insufficient uptake of prove bycatch mitigation measure such as circle hook andor finfish bait all 6 specie of sea turtle in the wcpo remain threatened or endanger with no evidence of cmm 200803 having slow or reverse negative trend on threaten and endanger sea turtle population the burden of proof remain on the wcpfc to demonstrate that sea turtle bycatch impact in tuna operation be be minimize and to take strong measure if they be not be minimize wwf believe that there exist a strong basis for revise cmm 200803 to 1 ensure more suitable requirement for the determination of optimal bycatch mitigation package ie circle hook andor other measure such as finfish bait for individual fishery 2 reduce the ambiguity in language and 3 improve the definition of the desire outcome of the cmm moreover evidence suggest that the wcpfc and member state have not suitably monitor the cmm for effectiveness with some part of the cmm distinguish as provide excessive room for creative compliance8 while cmm 200803 require all longline vessel to carry turtle dehooker and line cutter wcpfc have provide no wwf position statement to the wcpfc 12th regular session bali indonesia 38 december 2015 monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of this requirement and only a small fraction of member country have conduct dedicated research on sea turtle mitigation techniques9 indeed as recently as 2010 over three quarter of ccms either do not report on compliance with cmm 200803 or do not meet all the cmm measure furthermore only a small fraction of member country have conduct dedicated research on sea turtle mitigation technique and current observer coverage fall well below the recommend level for effectively determine optimal mitigation approach ie 10 coverage over 3 year the precautionary principle require that all ccms must determine optimal bycatch mitigation strategy base on research and sound science most importantly wwf believe that the wcpfc should reconsider cmm 200803 in light of new information available regard fishery impact on sea turtle and the impact of various mitigation measure on turtle bycatch10 specifically recent study in the eastern pacific ocean as well as atsea trial by wwf in vietnam and papua new guinea far confirm the positive impact of turtle bycatch mitigation use circle hook thereby indicate a need for further consideration and adoption of circle hook in the wcpo longline fisheries11 wwf recommend the wcpfc consider and develop revision of cmm 20083 aim at o reduce the ambiguity in language strengthen key language and reduce the vagueness in desire outcome of the cmm thereby enable well monitoring of cmm effectiveness o introduce new bind measure for the use of circle hook in all longline fleet exempt only if an equally effective solution for the mortality of sea turtle can be demonstrate o introduce strong measure for conduct research on mitigation technique and reporting on sea turtle impact as a means of determine optimal mitigation package for individual fleet and o set an appropriate interim catch rate that would trigger moveon provision encourage member state involvement and participation in the research conduct under the analysis of sea turtle mitigation measure effectiveness in tuna longline fishery describe in ebwp05 present at sc11 tropical tunas wwf maintain that the policy choice make repeatedly by the wcpfc fail to achieve meaningful conservation of bet wwf also believe that there could be substantial improvement to the understanding of the impact of fish aggregating devices fad through the aggressive pursuit of improved monitor surveillance and general research involve fad follow by appropriately target limit or management measure while there be ongoing effort within the spc and pna to pursue great understanding of fad dynamic we believe that the wcpfc should impose measure in support of fad research aid by monitoring and surveillance mechanism which could for instance improve the understanding of the impact on specie composition result from fad typesize geographic location drift pattern and prevail current ocean depth and depth of fad material proximity to benthic reliefhydrogeographic feature the wcpfc absolutely must make effective and enforceable reduction of the catch in all sector to achieve a meaningful conservation impact for bet most importantly whatever measure the wcpfc select absolutely must be subject to strong monitoring control and surveillance measure wwf recommend that the wcpfc establish and support further research and monitoring of fads wwf position statement to the wcpfc 12th regular session bali indonesia 38 december 2015 engage in an open and transparent deliberative process base on the good available scientific information to determine the level of reduction in bet catch necessary to achieve meaningful bet conservation and revise the current tropical tunas cmm to achieve substantial reduction in bet mortality regional observer programme information collect as part of an appropriate observer programme be critically important to the proper management of a fishery datum collect by observer play a central role in inform fishery scientist on everything range from stock assessment to nontarget species impact furthermore observer play an indispensable role in monitoring and enforce very important cmm in the wcpo indeed observer represent the vanguard of fishery management through the science and service that they provide consequently observer coverage and the safety and security of those observer must be consider a top priority and great support must be provide to the relevant authority to see that the capacity of the rop be strengthen observer programme management and administration the wcpfc must ensure through appropriate guidance that national observer programme administer under the rop be fully resource in term of human and financial capital as well as govern under appropriate administrative and management structure within that consideration the wcpfc must contemplate different funding model that ccms may consider for ensure proper administration and management of the observer program at a national level include those that incorporate sustainable financing through a valid and functional cost recovery system the wcpfc have give inadequate consideration to the necessary resourcing of one of the most critical part of fishery management in the region the national and regional observer program urgent attention must be give to the development and full funding of minimum standard that ensure a national programme can perform to rop standard include such effort as continue annual review of the national program under preagreed performance standard as well as continue regular training for all regional and national observer programme staff observer coverage on longline vessels wwf note that observer coverage on longline vessel operate in the wcpo regardless of the metric use to calculate it remain substantially less than 5 regionwide moreover wwf wish to point out that the 5 observer coverage value identify by the wcpfc represent an arbitrary benchmark that be never intend to represent an end goal but rather a minimum starting point toward appropriate observer coverage even a consistently apply level of 5 coverage be statistically and practically useless for most management or monitor control and surveillance mcs purpose therefore wwf support effort to improve the observer coverage of all longline fishery in the wcpo as such wwf support calculate observer coverage accord to the propose hierarchy of four metric for assess observer coverage but note that good practice would be to use number of hook deploy as an appropriate metric if other metric for calculate coverage be use term must be very clearly define in advance and each metric must be calculate in a way to be comparable to the other metric wwf also note that different level of observer coverage may be require for management or compliance purpose depend on specific identify objective and recommend that appropriate analysis be conduct to determine each of those level respectively in the context of identify objective most importantly the wcpfc must demand that the rop and national observer programme receive full funding and support to ensure their continue operation and that the level of observer coverage on longline vessel be increase immediately to achieve management and compliance objective wwf position statement to the wcpfc 12th regular session bali indonesia 38 december 2015 transhipment monitoring transhipment remain one of the most prominent weakness in catch documentation and verification that lead to illegal unreported and unregulated iuu catch in the wcpo wwf note that the most simple efficient and effective solution to the challenge of transhipmentrelate iuu be to simply prohibit all atsea transhipment and require all fishing vessel to land their catch at the near available designate port in the wcpo follow the conclusion of fishing activity however acknowledge that a prohibition on transhipment be unlikely at this point wwf support an unequivocal 100 observer monitoring requirement for all transhipment wwf far encourage the commission to consider the recommendation of the iwgrop to adopt the propose amendment to cmm 200906 to establish additional reporting requirement for receive vessel operate in the convention area12 wwf also support the guideline and suggest format for report to the secretariat although wwf would also encourage the development of fully electronic templates13 most importantly wwf strongly recommend that due to the prominent compliance monitoring role of transhipment observer that they receive twoway communication device describe in the follow section as a matter of urgent priority wwf also recommend that transhipment requirement be buttress by verification and validation of transhipment activity through the use of a vessel monitoring system vms and supplement by an operate automate identification system ais if through investigation of suspect unreported transhipment activity indicate by vms and corroborate by ais it be determine that transhipment activity be conduct in violation of transhipment rule the offend vessel should be subject to sanction up to and include list on the iuu vessel blacklist observer safety and security in the course of their official duty observer be vulnerable to assault obstruction resistance delay intimidation or interference which be all very clear violation under cmm 200701 attachment k annex 1 paragraph 1i thus observer provider and authority have a discrete obligation to address allege violation report by observer quickly and effectively when national or regional observer programme and other authority fail to address these report violation effectively and in a timely manner it signal to the observer that provider either do not care or be incapable of provide support for their welfare moreover the failure of provider or the national authority to act on a report have an additional effect of signal to vessel captain and crew that they may conduct violation against observer without retribution follow recent tragedy involve observer both in the wcpfc and iattc convention area the wcpfc must urgently address observer safety and security standard the wcpfc must immediately adopt standard that include the mean for an observer to independently report or otherwise signal in real time any emergency include interference or assault currently available technology could allow direct and independent communication between observer and observer provider many of the device also operate as a waterproof personal locator beacons plbs in case of an accidental overboard situation furthermore observer programme must also urgently adopt an emergency action plan eap that designate procedure to ensure that observer emergency can be quickly and effectively respond to by authority the technology tool be effectively useless to the observer if there be nobody designate to respond on the other end wwf believe that every observer should be issue one of these device and observer programme must have a welldefined and effective eap in place prior to any observer deployment lastly the wcpfc must also implement a recordkeeping and reporting mechanism that require any violation against observer to be forward to the wcpfc secretariat secretariat as soon as possible after the incident have occur by inform the secretariat the secretariat may then alert and potentially coordinate with other observer programme immediately such as in case of man overboard situation that require search and recovery coordination the secretariat could also offer assistance to the programme and the observer where possible as well as provide followup to ensure corrective action have be take on behalf of the observer more importantly the secretariat could wwf position statement to the wcpfc 12th regular session bali indonesia 38 december 2015 maintain a record of vessel and crewmember involve in violation against observer which could be make available to observer provider to well assess future placement of observer and avoid potential escalation of threat against observer wwf recommend the wcpfc far implement of a bind consistent and consolidated set of standard for the rop develop an analysis of the observer programme in the context of proper management include an analysis of different sustainable funding model endorse an analysis of level of observer coverage require to achieve management or compliance purpose while ensure that the metric and methodology use support development of appropriate comparative analysis support or endorse the use of vms and ais to verify and validate 100 observer coverage on all transhipment as well as support strong penalty and sanction for violation mandate authorise observer programme to provide observer before any boarding for a trip o an approve independent two way communication satellite device and o a waterproof personal lifesaving beacon mandate authorise observer programme to develop and implement an emergency action plan eap to accommodate any observer emergency include interference or assault and mandate recordkeeping and reporting requirement that compel all ccm to report all instance of violation against of observer as soon as possible to the wcpfc secretariat pacific bluefin tuna technical report of both the international scientific committee for tuna and tunalike species in the north pacific ocean isc and the iattc indicate that the pacific bluefin tuna stock be in extremely poor condition the isc confirm that overfishing be occur the stock be heavily overfished and its spawn stock biomass have decline by as much as 9614 this be a clear indicator that the management measure take both in the western and central pacific and in the eastern pacific be prove insufficient to conserve the biological integrity of this stock the iattc and wcpfc must assume their share of responsibility the last assessment confirm that the stock be highly deplete that fishing mortality exceed all reasonable proxy for fmsy the recovery of the stock may be far delay if the current scenario of low recruitment continue which be heavily reliant on a major adult cohort in the population while the wcpfc adopt conservation measure call for reduction in catch for pacific bluefin tuna of 30 kg in size conservation of spawn stock be also need wwf maintain deep concern regard this stock with an aim of restore and rebuild this ecologically sociologically and economically important fishery resource the current science strongly indicate that there be only one reproductive cohort that be reach the end of its life additionally about 90 of the stock fish be comprise of young fish that have not yet reproduce thus the continue reproductive success of the entire stock depend on the reproductive success of a single cohort leave the stock in a critical situation that may seriously jeopardize recruitment wwf encourage close monitoring of fishery and catch as well as completion of a revise stock assessment for pacific bluefin in early 2016 wwf urge both iattc and wcpfc to adopt a long term pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan target 20ssbf0 and harvest control rule that be well define preagreed and contain mandatory action for a determined course of management action in response to change in indicator of stock status with respect to reference point the wcpfc consistent with the good scientific information must act to ensure that fishing mortality on pacific bluefin tuna be urgently reduce especially on juvenile in order to reduce the risk of wwf position statement to the wcpfc 12th regular session bali indonesia 38 december 2015 recruitment collapse and allow spawn stock to rebuild if the wcpfc fail to adopt sufficient management measure at this meeting it may be force to consider a prohibition on continue fishing of the stock in the near future wwf recommend that the wcpfc adopt a longterm pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan target at least 20ssb0 by and implement a size limit for pacific bluefin tuna of 30 kg to conserve spawn stock in addition to the current temporary management measure clarke shelley c et al 2013 population trends in pacific oceanic sharks and the utility of regulations on shark

WCPFC12-2015-OP08,5.0,Overview The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC has a mandate to manage all highly migratory fish stocks including tuna and sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean Despite strong scientific and management advice to the Commission the conservation and management measures CMMs now in place are inadequate to end or prevent overfishing of some stocks Although some progress has been made on the conservation and management of sharks much more is needed to guarantee that unsustainable shark fishing does not occur Ensuring healthy fisheries requires strong conservation and management actions and strict compliance The Pew Charitable Trusts urges all Commission Members Cooperating NonMembers and Participating Territories known collectively as CCMsto cooperate in order to Adopt timelines to develop and implement harvest strategies for tunas Rebuild the Pacific bluefin tuna population End bigeye tuna overfishing and effectively manage fish aggregating devices FADs Refine current management measures to reduce shark mortality in fisheries targeting other species Develop a comprehensive list of requirements for shark management plans Prohibit retention of mobulid rays and adopt live release guidance Enact measures to improve data collection for key shark species Adopt minimum standards for port inspections Enhance the effectiveness of the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels and the Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU Fishing Vessel List Ban transshipment at sea Strengthen the Commission compliance monitoring scheme and provide greater transparency Recommendations to the 12th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission8 December 2015 Bali Indonesia A brief from End overfishing rebuild overfished stocks and implement sustainable management of tunas Fishing pressure continues to increase in the Western and Central Pacific In 2014 the overall catch of tuna in WCPFC waters was the highest on record more than 28 million metric tons representing 60 per cent of the global tuna catch In addition the catch of skipjack and yellowfin reached alltime highs The overall catch by purse seine vessels was also the highest on record with a skipjack haul 6 percent bigger than the previous record in 2013 With Pacific bluefin and bigeye tunas both overfished it is clear that fishery management actions to date are insufficient Factors driving these increased catches include the longterm trend toward greater fishing capacity as well as greater technological capability and the more efficient use of drifting FADs humanmade objects that attract fish The use of FADs has led to more tuna being caught in a fishing day and CCMs have not sufficiently addressed the impact of these devices particularly on the catch of juvenile bigeye tuna CCMs have committed to ensuring the longterm conservation and sustainable use of tuna stocks In doing so they agreed to set reference points for tuna species apply the precautionary approach and take measures to prevent or eliminate overfishing among other actions Because they have not yet taken these actions stocks continue to experience overfishing or approach the limits of sustainability As a matter of urgency CCMs must cooperate and compromise on basic management immediately to end overfishing and ensure sustainable management of stocks in the Convention Area Adopt timelines to develop and implement harvest strategies for tunas Last year CCMs took a significant step forward by adopting measure CMM 201406 In that measure they committed to developing and implementing a sixpart harvest strategy approach for each of the key tuna fisheries or stocks to ensure that Commission objectives are met and prevent biological limits from being exceeded The measure requires the Commission to agree no later than this years annual meeting on a workplan that contains an indicative time frame for adoption of harvest strategies Earlier this year the Scientific Committee reviewed a draft workplan for four tuna speciesskipjack yellowfin bigeye and South Pacific albacoreand strongly supported its continued development As an element of the harvest strategy approach the Parties to the Nauru Agreement and the New Zealand territory of Tokelau have proposed a target reference point for skipjack equivalent to twice the biomass that would produce maximum sustainable yield The Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency FFA has proposed a target reference point for South Pacific albacore that is greater than maximum sustainable yield Pew strongly supports adoption of both of these target reference points to ensure the sustainability of these key stocks Given the increasing threats to the sustainability of tuna populations the WCPFC should adopt a harvest strategy workplan with timelines for reaching agreement on management objectives reference points and harvest control rules as quickly as possible but no later than 2018 As a first step the WCPFC should adopt the proposed skipjack and South Pacific albacore target reference points this year Rebuild the Pacific bluefin tuna population Urgent action is needed to reverse the declining stock status of Pacific bluefin The 2014 stock assessment update conducted by the International Scientific Committee confirmed that decades of overfishing have severely depleted the population to 4 percent of its unfished biomass In 2015 an analysis by Japans National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries concluded that even with full implementation of existing conservation measures the Pacific bluefin population will continue to decline through 2018 The analysis found that over the next decade there is a 1 in 3 chance that this population will drop to the lowest level ever recorded CMM 201406 requires the Northern Committee to develop and recommend a workplan and indicative time frames for a harvest strategy for Pacific bluefin by no later than the Committees 2015 meeting Despite that direction the parties did not reach agreement on either at the Northern Committee meeting recently held in Sapporo Japan That means they have not met the measures requirements which are a high priority due to the fragile state of the population At this point the Northern Committees lack of response could irreversibly jeopardize the Pacific bluefin recovery1 The full WCPFC must take a more proactive role in overseeing the Northern Committee and the management and conservation of Pacific bluefin tuna The WCPFC should directly task the Northern Committee with developing by the Committees 2016 meeting a workplan for Pacific bluefin that will return the population to a level capable of producing maximum sustainable yield by 2030 End bigeye tuna overfishing and effectively manage fish aggregating devices FADs Pacific bigeye tuna is overfished and overfishing has occurred for many years beginning before the Commission was established The status of the stock continues to worsen despite clear scientific advice to reduce bigeye mortality The 2014 assessment found that the stock had declined to 16 per cent of its unfished size and the Masa UshiodaSeaPicscom Skipjack tuna Scientific Committee recommended reducing overall fishing mortality by 36 per cent from 20082011 levels Even with updated scientific data that show the stocks continued decline the Commission last year failed to act to improve its status This year the WCPFC has new information that proves the urgent need to improve bigeye management a sensitivity analysis of the stock assessment reaffirming the dire status of bigeye and an increase of 5 per cent in the overall catch of bigeye in 2014 Given that catches of bigeye are not yet being reduced to the levels recommended by the Scientific Committee2 the WCPFC needs to strengthen the tropical tuna conservation measure CMM 201401 Currently the measure is not meeting its goal of ending overfishing by the end of 2017 by reducing catch in the FAD purse seine fishery and by major longline fleets Nearly all of the bigeye harvested by purse seiners are juvenile fish caught on FADs The goal of Commission ordered FAD closures was to reduce the number of FAD sets and by doing so to reduce bigeye mortality However although the WCPFC doubled the closure period from two months in 2009 to four months starting in more bigeye are being caught in the purse seine fishery than in earlier years 67367 metric tons in 2014 compared with 57906 in 2009 The number of FAD sets in 2014 was the thirdhighest on record well above a benchmark level previously recommended by the Scientific Committee Technical changes to improve implementation and compliance with the FAD closure will not be enough to generate real reductions in bigeye mortality to protect this billiondollar fishery Given the increasing fishing pressure on bigeye tuna and the poor status of the stock the WCPFC should immediately reduce bigeye mortality and replace ineffective FAD closure periods with measures that directly control the catch in the purse seine fishery such as FAD set limits or quotas The WCPFC should task the FAD Working Group established last year to provide advice on structuring and implementing such measures Strengthen conservation and management of sharks Every year about 100 million sharks an unsustainable number are caught and killed in commercial fisheries3 Regardless of whether this catch is highly sought after or unintended and unwanted managers must take immediate action to counter declining shark populations and mitigate the damage it causes to marine ecosystems Until measures are in place to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of sharks is sustainable their capture with fishing gear should be avoided and they should be released alive whenever possible Fishing gear that increases the likelihood of shark catch such as wire leaders and shark lines should be prohibited and research should be undertaken to determine the best means of avoiding shark catch If WCPFC Members are to continue to target sharks or to retain sharks caught as bycatch then management measures must be enacted that reflect the precautionary principle Such measures would ensure that all sharks in the Convention Area are sustainably caught and that WCPFC fisheries are not contributing to the global overfishing of sharks Refine current management measures in order to reduce shark mortality in fisheries targeting other species The Scientific Committee this year highlighted concerns about the effectiveness of and compliance with existing shark conservation management measures Although CMM 201405 is an important step in reducing shark mortality giving CCMs a choice to use either wire trace or shark lines does not do enough to reduce overall shark mortality at the rate needed to ensure that catches are sustainable Under current rules CCMs may simply ban the gear that is not commonly used by their fleets and the targeting of sharks can continue without effective management The recommendation by the Scientific Committee SC11 to ban both wire trace and shark lines would be a stronger and more robust approach to reducing the mortality of vulnerable shark species Prohibiting both gears in fisheries that do not target sharks would reduce bycatch of species such as oceanic whitetip and silky sharks which suffer mortality even though their retention is prohibited This year the WCPFC should adopt an updated CMM that prohibits the use of wire leaders and shark lines in fisheries targeting other species Develop a comprehensive list of requirements for shark management plans Under CMM 201405 CCMs must develop management plans for fisheries that target sharks as part of other WCPFC fisheries Although this measure is important to ensuring sustainable stocks it provides little guidance on what the plans should include To ensure that sharks are not overfished shark management plans should contain a comprehensive list of requirements not just a minimum set The WCPFC also must properly define a targeted fishery to ensure that all shark catch is properly managed The WCPFC should develop a clear definition of a targeted shark fishery a comprehensive list of requirements for all shark management plans and guidelines for how the management plans will be reviewed Prohibit retention of mobulid rays and adopt live release guidance The family Mobulidae which includes manta rays and mobula rays are extremely vulnerable to overfishing and are caught as bycatch in tuna purse seine fisheries Observer reports show that manta and mobula rays are often killed as bycatch in WCPFC purse seine fisheries 284 metric tons were recorded from 1994 to 20094 In 2015 the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission prohibited retention of mobulid rays and approved recommendations on how best to release these rays alive when they are caught incidentally The WCPFC should adopt a similar measure to ensure that these species are protected throughout the Pacific Because of the vulnerability of these rays the WCPFC should prohibit retention of all mobulid species and adopt live release guidance Enact measures to improve data collection for key shark species Getting accurate assessments of the status of shark stocks in the western and central Pacific remains difficult because of limited data recording and reporting on the catch of shark species Such information gaps inhibit development of comprehensive scientific advice The WCPFC should adopt a no data no fish measure for sharks similar to one put in place by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas Such a policy would improve data collection by prohibiting CCMs from retaining or landing any of 14 key shark species identified by the Commission if they have not submitted landing data on any catch of that species from the previous year Enhance CCMs transparency and accountability As in other parts of the world illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing remains a threat in the WCPFC Convention Area The Commission has taken important steps to improve compliance with its management measures but the WCPFC cannot do its job effectively unless it requires complete transparency from all CCMs and imposes serious consequences for any lack of compliance with these requirements Adopt minimum standards for port inspections Port State Measures PSMs are costeffective tools to monitor compliance with management arrangements and prevent illegally caught fish from entering the market In 2013 the WCPFC Performance Review recommended that a new CMM on port State measures be adopted and implemented within the Convention Area at the earliest opportunity The review acknowledged that the WCPFC is lagging behind other regional fisheries management organizations in adopting port State measures5 In 2013 and 2014 the Commission considered a proposal from FFA for a CMM on Port State Measures to Prevent Deter and Eliminate IUU fishing which provided minimum standards for port inspections with regard for the special requirements of Small Island Developing States and Participating Territories This proposal reflected a compromise among CCMs positions and offered a good basis for progress towards a regional scheme Unfortunately the proposal did not receive support from all CCMs Pew hopes that such a proposal can be reconsidered and adopted at the upcoming Commission meeting To help monitor compliance and prevent illegal fish from entering the market the WCPFC should adopt a CMM on Port State Measures Enhance the effectiveness of the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels and the IUU Vessel List On 1 January 2016 CMM 201310 requiring the mandatory use of International Maritime Organization IMO numbers for large WCPFC vessels enters into force CCMs must ensure their vessels timely compliance with this requirement In addition to increase the transparency of fishing operations relevant vessel information such as any administrative or judicial actions should be included in the Record of Fishing Vessels The WCPFC should require that CCMs provide to the Secretariat public information on any final administrative or judicial action taken in cases of noncompliance with fisheries regulations by their flagged vessels that are listed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels This requirement would apply to all flagged vessels that operate in the Convention Area in waters beyond their national jurisdiction Such public information should be provided as soon as possible and be published as part of the Record of Fishing Vessels Such pioneering transparency would showcase the efforts of CCMs and the WCPFC Secretariat to foster greater compliance To enhance the effectiveness of the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels the WCPFC should require by 1 January submission of actions taken in cases of noncompliance Placing vessels found to have fished illegally on the WCPFCs IUU vessel list highlights and helps deter unacceptable practices in the Convention Area Current rules however allow IUU vessels to be added to the list only once a year diminishing the effectiveness of the listing As a result IUU vessels operate unhindered until the Commission acts at its annual meeting to place new vessels on the list The WCPFC has already established a procedure that permits removing vessels from the IUU vessel list between meetings It should amend its procedures to allow vessels to be listed between sessions as well The WCPFC should establish a procedure that permits the listing of IUU vessels at times other than its annual meeting Ban transshipment at sea Transshipment at sea continues to provide opportunities for illegal fishers to avoid proper catch reporting and to launder illicitly caught fish The WCPFC should introduce a ban on all forms of transshipment at sea until it can be assured that transshipment operations do not contribute to IUU fishing This would require a robust monitoring system that ensures full transparency including observers andor fisheries officers on board both the offloading and receiving vessels and notification of all transshipment operations occurring at sea in the Convention Area The WCPFC should ban transshipment at sea until the Commission can be assured through proper and effective monitoring that transshipment operations cannot facilitate IUU fishing Strengthen the Commission compliance monitoring scheme and provide greater transparency Article 23 of the Convention obliges Members of the Commission to the greatest extent possible to take measures to ensure that their nationals and fishing vessels owned or controlled by their nationals comply with Convention provisions Likewise Article 246 requires Members to take the necessary measures to ensure that fishing vessels flying their flags comply with Convention provisions and CMMs The joint meeting of tuna regional fisheries management organizations in 2009 recommended that the organizations develop robust compliance review mechanisms so that the records of each Party could be examined in depth on an annual basis7 As a result the WCPFC established a Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS to ensure that CCMs comply with their obligations The CMS is designed to assess CCMs compliance and identify areas where technical assistance or capacity building may be needed to help boost compliance and identify aspects of conservation and management measures that may require refinement or amendment for effective implementation In establishing the compliance monitoring scheme CCMs said the process would be conducted in a responsible open transparent and nondiscriminatory manner so that the Commission could be made aware of all available information relevant to its work in identifying instances of noncompliance and holding parties accountable This year the WCPFC should again take steps to refine the CMS to increase its effectiveness in identifying and holding CCMs accountable for instances of noncompliance The scheme should be able to respond to non compliance with a range of options that take into account the reason for and degree of noncompliance It should include cooperative capacitybuilding initiatives and in cases of serious noncompliance allow for penalties and other actions that promote

fisheries commission8 december 2015 bali indonesia a brief from end overfishe rebuild overfished stock and implement sustainable management of tuna fishing pressure continue to increase in the western and central pacific in 2014 the overall catch of tuna in wcpfc water be the high on record more than 28 million metric ton represent 60 per cent of the global tuna catch in addition the catch of skipjack and yellowfin reach alltime high the overall catch by purse seine vessel be also the high on record with a skipjack haul 6 percent big than the previous record in 2013 with pacific bluefin and bigeye tuna both overfishe it be clear that fishery management action to date be insufficient factor drive these increase catch include the longterm trend toward great fishing capacity as well as great technological capability and the more efficient use of drift fad humanmade object that attract fish the use of fad have lead to more tuna be catch in a fishing day and ccms have not sufficiently address the impact of these device particularly on the catch of juvenile bigeye tuna ccms have commit to ensure the longterm conservation and sustainable use of tuna stock in do so they agree to set reference point for tuna specie apply the precautionary approach and take measure to prevent or eliminate overfishing among other action because they have not yet take these action stock continue to experience overfishe or approach the limit of sustainability as a matter of urgency ccm must cooperate and compromise on basic management immediately to end overfishe and ensure sustainable management of stock in the convention area adopt timeline to develop and implement harvest strategy for tuna last year ccms take a significant step forward by adopt measure cmm 201406 in that measure they commit to develop and implement a sixpart harvest strategy approach for each of the key tuna fishery or stock to ensure that commission objective be meet and prevent biological limit from be exceed the measure require the commission to agree no later than this year annual meeting on a workplan that contain an indicative time frame for adoption of harvest strategy early this year the scientific committee review a draft workplan for four tuna speciesskipjack yellowfin bigeye and south pacific albacoreand strongly support its continue development as an element of the harvest strategy approach the parties to the nauru agreement and the new zealand territory of tokelau have propose a target reference point for skipjack equivalent to twice the biomass that would produce maximum sustainable yield the pacific islands forum fisheries agency ffa have propose a target reference point for south pacific albacore that be great than maximum sustainable yield pew strongly support adoption of both of these target reference point to ensure the sustainability of these key stock give the increase threat to the sustainability of tuna population the wcpfc should adopt a harvest strategy workplan with timeline for reach agreement on management objective reference point and harvest control rule as quickly as possible but no later than 2018 as a first step the wcpfc should adopt the propose skipjack and south pacific albacore target reference point this year rebuild the pacific bluefin tuna population urgent action be need to reverse the decline stock status of pacific bluefin the 2014 stock assessment update conduct by the international scientific committee confirm that decade of overfishing have severely deplete the population to 4 percent of its unfished biomass in 2015 an analysis by japans national research institute of far seas fisheries conclude that even with full implementation of exist conservation measure the pacific bluefin population will continue to decline through 2018 the analysis find that over the next decade there be a 1 in 3 chance that this population will drop to the low level ever record cmm 201406 require the northern committee to develop and recommend a workplan and indicative time frame for a harvest strategy for pacific bluefin by no later than the committees 2015 meeting despite that direction the party do not reach agreement on either at the northern committee meeting recently hold in sapporo japan that mean they have not meet the measure requirement which be a high priority due to the fragile state of the population at this point the northern committees lack of response could irreversibly jeopardize the pacific bluefin recovery1 the full wcpfc must take a more proactive role in oversee the northern committee and the management and conservation of pacific bluefin tuna the wcpfc should directly task the northern committee with develop by the committees 2016 meet a workplan for pacific bluefin that will return the population to a level capable of produce maximum sustainable yield by 2030 end bigeye tuna overfishe and effectively manage fish aggregate device fads pacific bigeye tuna be overfished and overfishing have occur for many year begin before the commission be establish the status of the stock continue to worsen despite clear scientific advice to reduce bigeye mortality the 2014 assessment find that the stock have decline to 16 per cent of its unfished size and the masa ushiodaseapicscom skipjack tuna scientific committee recommend reduce overall fishing mortality by 36 per cent from 20082011 level even with update scientific datum that show the stock continue decline the commission last year fail to act to improve its status this year the wcpfc have new information that prove the urgent need to improve bigeye management a sensitivity analysis of the stock assessment reaffirm the dire status of bigeye and an increase of 5 per cent in the overall catch of bigeye in 2014 give that catch of bigeye be not yet be reduce to the level recommend by the scientific committee2 the wcpfc need to strengthen the tropical tuna conservation measure cmm 201401 currently the measure be not meet its goal of end overfishe by the end of 2017 by reduce catch in the fad purse seine fishery and by major longline fleet nearly all of the bigeye harvest by purse seiner be juvenile fish catch on fad the goal of commission order fad closure be to reduce the number of fad set and by do so to reduce bigeye mortality however although the wcpfc double the closure period from two month in 2009 to four month start in more bigeye be be catch in the purse seine fishery than in early year 67367 metric ton in 2014 compare with 57906 in 2009 the number of fad set in 2014 be the thirdhigh on record well above a benchmark level previously recommend by the scientific committee technical change to improve implementation and compliance with the fad closure will not be enough to generate real reduction in bigeye mortality to protect this billiondollar fishery give the increase fishing pressure on bigeye tuna and the poor status of the stock the wcpfc should immediately reduce bigeye mortality and replace ineffective fad closure period with measure that directly control the catch in the purse seine fishery such as fad set limit or quota the wcpfc should task the fad working group establish last year to provide advice on structuring and implement such measure strengthen conservation and management of shark every year about 100 million shark an unsustainable number be catch and kill in commercial fisheries3 regardless of whether this catch be highly seek after or unintended and unwanted manager must take immediate action to counter decline shark population and mitigate the damage it cause to marine ecosystem until measure be in place to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of shark be sustainable their capture with fishing gear should be avoid and they should be release alive whenever possible fishing gear that increase the likelihood of shark catch such as wire leader and shark line should be prohibit and research should be undertake to determine the good mean of avoid shark catch if wcpfc member be to continue to target shark or to retain shark catch as bycatch then management measure must be enact that reflect the precautionary principle such measure would ensure that all shark in the convention area be sustainably catch and that wcpfc fishery be not contribute to the global overfishing of shark refine current management measure in order to reduce shark mortality in fishery target other specie the scientific committee this year highlight concern about the effectiveness of and compliance with exist shark conservation management measure although cmm 201405 be an important step in reduce shark mortality give ccm a choice to use either wire trace or shark line do not do enough to reduce overall shark mortality at the rate need to ensure that catch be sustainable under current rule ccms may simply ban the gear that be not commonly use by their fleet and the targeting of shark can continue without effective management the recommendation by the scientific committee sc11 to ban both wire trace and shark line would be a strong and more robust approach to reduce the mortality of vulnerable shark specie prohibit both gear in fishery that do not target shark would reduce bycatch of specie such as oceanic whitetip and silky shark which suffer mortality even though their retention be prohibit this year the wcpfc should adopt an update cmm that prohibit the use of wire leader and shark line in fishery target other specie develop a comprehensive list of requirement for shark management plan under cmm 201405 ccms must develop management plan for fishery that target shark as part of other wcpfc fishery although this measure be important to ensure sustainable stock it provide little guidance on what the plan should include to ensure that shark be not overfished shark management plan should contain a comprehensive list of requirement not just a minimum set the wcpfc also must properly define a target fishery to ensure that all shark catch be properly manage the wcpfc should develop a clear definition of a target shark fishery a comprehensive list of requirement for all shark management plan and guideline for how the management plan will be review prohibit retention of mobulid ray and adopt live release guidance the family mobulidae which include manta ray and mobula ray be extremely vulnerable to overfishe and be catch as bycatch in tuna purse seine fishery observer report show that manta and mobula ray be often kill as bycatch in wcpfc purse seine fishery 284 metric ton be record from 1994 to 20094 in 2015 the interamerican tropical tuna commission prohibit retention of mobulid ray and approve recommendation on how good to release these ray alive when they be catch incidentally the wcpfc should adopt a similar measure to ensure that these specie be protect throughout the pacific because of the vulnerability of these ray the wcpfc should prohibit retention of all mobulid specie and adopt live release guidance enact measure to improve datum collection for key shark specie get accurate assessment of the status of shark stock in the western and central pacific remain difficult because of limited datum recording and reporting on the catch of shark specie such information gap inhibit development of comprehensive scientific advice the wcpfc should adopt a no datum no fish measure for shark similar to one put in place by the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas such a policy would improve datum collection by prohibit ccms from retain or land any of 14 key shark specie identify by the commission if they have not submit landing datum on any catch of that specie from the previous year enhance ccms transparency and accountability as in other part of the world illegal unreported and unregulated iuu fishing remain a threat in the wcpfc convention area the commission have take important step to improve compliance with its management measure but the wcpfc can not do its job effectively unless it require complete transparency from all ccms and impose serious consequence for any lack of compliance with these requirement adopt minimum standard for port inspection port state measures psm be costeffective tool to monitor compliance with management arrangement and prevent illegally catch fish from enter the market in 2013 the wcpfc performance review recommend that a new cmm on port state measure be adopt and implement within the convention area at the early opportunity the review acknowledge that the wcpfc be lag behind other regional fishery management organization in adopt port state measures5 in 2013 and 2014 the commission consider a proposal from ffa for a cmm on port state measures to prevent deter and eliminate iuu fishing which provide minimum standard for port inspection with regard for the special requirement of small island developing states and participating territories this proposal reflect a compromise among ccm position and offer a good basis for progress towards a regional scheme unfortunately the proposal do not receive support from all ccm pew hope that such a proposal can be reconsider and adopt at the upcoming commission meeting to help monitor compliance and prevent illegal fish from enter the market the wcpfc should adopt a cmm on port state measures enhance the effectiveness of the wcpfc record of fishing vessels and the iuu vessel list on 1 january 2016 cmm 201310 require the mandatory use of international maritime organization imo number for large wcpfc vessel enter into force ccms must ensure their vessel timely compliance with this requirement in addition to increase the transparency of fishing operation relevant vessel information such as any administrative or judicial action should be include in the record of fishing vessels the wcpfc should require that ccms provide to the secretariat public information on any final administrative or judicial action take in case of noncompliance with fishery regulation by their flag vessel that be list on the wcpfc record of fishing vessels this requirement would apply to all flag vessel that operate in the convention area in water beyond their national jurisdiction such public information should be provide as soon as possible and be publish as part of the record of fishing vessels such pioneer transparency would showcase the effort of ccms and the wcpfc secretariat to foster great compliance to enhance the effectiveness of the wcpfc record of fishing vessels the wcpfc should require by 1 january submission of action take in case of noncompliance placing vessel find to have fish illegally on the wcpfc iuu vessel list highlight and help deter unacceptable practice in the convention area current rule however allow iuu vessel to be add to the list only once a year diminish the effectiveness of the listing as a result iuu vessel operate unhindered until the commission act at its annual meeting to place new vessel on the list the wcpfc have already establish a procedure that permit remove vessel from the iuu vessel list between meeting it should amend its procedure to allow vessel to be list between session as well the wcpfc should establish a procedure that permit the listing of iuu vessel at time other than its annual meeting ban transshipment at sea transshipment at sea continue to provide opportunity for illegal fisher to avoid proper catch reporting and to launder illicitly catch fish the wcpfc should introduce a ban on all form of transshipment at sea until it can be assure that transshipment operation do not contribute to iuu fish this would require a robust monitoring system that ensure full transparency include observer andor fishery officer on board both the offloading and receive vessel and notification of all transshipment operation occur at sea in the convention area the wcpfc should ban transshipment at sea until the commission can be assure through proper and effective monitoring that transshipment operation can not facilitate iuu fish strengthen the commission compliance monitoring scheme and provide great transparency article 23 of the convention oblige member of the commission to the great extent possible to take measure to ensure that their national and fishing vessel own or control by their national comply with convention provision likewise article 246 require member to take the necessary measure to ensure that fishing vessel fly their flag comply with convention provision and cmm the joint meeting of tuna regional fishery management organization in 2009 recommend that the organization develop robust compliance review mechanism so that the record of each party could be examine in depth on an annual basis7 as a result the wcpfc establish a compliance monitoring scheme cms to ensure that ccms comply with their obligation the cms be design to assess ccms compliance and identify area where technical assistance or capacity building may be need to help boost compliance and identify aspect of conservation and management measure that may require refinement or amendment for effective implementation in establish the compliance monitor scheme ccms say the process would be conduct in a responsible open transparent and nondiscriminatory manner so that the commission could be make aware of all available information relevant to its work in identify instance of noncompliance and hold party accountable this year the wcpfc should again take step to refine the cms to increase its effectiveness in identify and hold ccms accountable for instance of noncompliance the scheme should be able to respond to non compliance with a range of option that take into account the reason for and degree of noncompliance it should include cooperative capacitybuilde initiative and in case of serious noncompliance allow for penalty and other action that promote compliance and include method to monitor and resolve outstanding instance of non compliance to help meet transparency requirement detail in article 21 of the convention and rule 15 of the rules of procedure it also should allow observer access to compliance monitoring review

the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission By way of background AFRF is funded by the Western Fishboat Owners Association WFOA which represents over 300 vessel owners crew and their supporters who fish for albacore tuna in the North and South Pacific using the troll and baitboat methods of fishing WFOA and AFRF working with the US National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS originated and developed the troll fishery for South Pacific albacore In the initial years of the WCPFC AFRF focused on promoting increased cooperation between this organization and the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC AFRF also brought tagging information in poster form to this Commission from ongoing cooperative programs with NMFS Then in 2005 AFRF drafted and sponsored the first management and conservation resolution for albacore in the IATTC Shortly thereafter AFRF sponsored a similar conservation and management resolution here in the WCPFC More recently AFRF has worked to develop scientifically based limit reference points for North and South Pacific albacore with a focus on collaboration between the Northern Committee and the IATTC to develop compatible reference points and harvest control rules for North Pacific albacore AFRF continues to support the development of scientifically based target reference points and harvest control rules for South Pacific albacore throughout the range of the species Page 1 of 2 This brings us to the current meeting of this Commission which will consider inter alia the development of target reference points harvest control rules for North and South Pacific albacore and limiting the fishery for South Pacific albacore Specifically with regard to target reference points and harvest control rules they must be based on good science They must also consider the health of the species throughout its range whether within or outside of the WCPFCs management area However we question how good the science can be with the extreme lack of timely and complete data from several of the Asian fleets Some way must be found to correct this situation which has gone on much too long Secondly AFRF suggests that the science provider for the Commission develop and utilize a Management Strategy Evaluation MSE along the lines of what the Northern Committee has tasked the International Science Committee ISC to perform for North Pacific albacore It appears that this is the course the WCPFC is on from the preliminary meetings which are being held After this evaluation occurs it will be possible to set rational target reference points and harvest control rules Finally while AFRF recognizes that something must be done immediately to curtail the greatly increased and subsidized Asian upswing in targeting South Pacific albacore in violation of current conservation and management measures closing the high seas to the US troll fishery is completely inappropriate The scientific consultants for the WCPFC have repeatedly stated that the troll fishery for South Pacific albacore has no impact on the stock see eg WCPFC92012IP11 This healthy and environmentally sustainable fishery was originated developed and pursued by the US

WCPFC12-2015-OP15,10.0,Guillermo Compen Director STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE IATTC Considering the need to respectfully express during the 12th regular session of the WCPFC some of the principal reasons behind the exhortation sent by the IATTC to this organization with the aim of seeking within the bounds of feasibility the unification of some management strategies for the tuna fisheries in the entire Pacific Ocean I would indicate the following The IATTC carries out extensive work in the field of scientific research on the assessment of the stocks of tunas and tunalike species in the eastern Pacific Ocean seeking constantly to propose to its Members a variety of management strategies and measures for the different tuna fisheries with the aim of maintaining catch levels within the range of maximum sustainable yields On the basis of this process the IATTC has determined that the best actions adopted to date for achieving the objective of sustainability in the fisheries for tropical tunas are the following a Strict control since 2002 of the carrying capacity of the purseseine fleet in the IATTC Convention Area by means of a Regional Vessel Register and the establishment of maximum limits to that capacity b A mechanism of total closure for the purseseine fleet for 62 days each year which has increased progressively since its initial duration of 30 days c A 30day closure in an area known as the corralito where the presence of juvenile bigeye tuna occurs with the greatest frequency These three measures together with the establishment of a permanent onboard observer program for all purseseine vessels with carrying capacities greater than 363 tonnes have helped us improve significantly the monitoring of compliance with resolutions and measures adopted by the IATTC as well as obtain the information necessary for the ongoing stock assessments carried out by the IATTC scientific staff With this wide experience and motivated by the worldwide concern regarding possible levels of overexploitation of some species of tunas such as bluefin bigeye and yellowfin in the entire Pacific Ocean we seek to increase the coordination between our two organizations This led to the IATTC at its last ordinary meeting held in July of this year in Guayaquil Ecuador deciding to send a respectful exhortation to the WCPFC to consider the following at its annual meeting in To strengthen cooperation with the IATTC in the scientific areas in order to improve their work dynamic jointly using similar assessment models for analyzing the status of all the shared stocks of tropical tunas in the Pacific Ocean as a whole To identify differences in characteristics and structure of purseseine operation and stock dynamics in the Central and Western Pacific and Eastern Pacific To develop management measures such as a total closure of catches for the purseseine fishery for skipjack bigeye and yellowfin tunas whereby the operation of the fleets is totally stopped in order to achieve greater efficiency of the measures for the sustainability of these species throughout the Pacific Ocean The number and timing of days of closure should be based on the best available science The WCPFC could consider making appropriate adjustments to other existing conservation and management measures if a total closure is adopted To work in the development of a coordinated rebuilding and management plan for the bluefin tuna stock The IATTC shall ask the WCPFC for a joint meeting with all interested parties after the stock assessment by the ISC is carried out in 2016 in order to adopt equivalent points of reference,guillermo compen director statement by the chairman of the iattc consider the need to respectfully express during the 12th regular session of the wcpfc some of the principal reason behind the exhortation send by the iattc to this organization with the aim of seek within the bound of feasibility the unification of some management strategy

limit to that capacity b a mechanism of total closure for the purseseine fleet for 62 day each year which have increase progressively since its initial duration of 30 day c a 30day closure in an area know as the corralito where the presence of juvenile bigeye tuna occur with the great frequency these three measure together with the establishment of a permanent onboard observer program for all purseseine vessel with carry capacity great than 363 tonne have help we improve significantly the monitoring of compliance with resolution and measure adopt by the iattc as well as obtain the information necessary for the ongoing stock assessment carry out by the iattc scientific staff with this wide experience and motivate by the worldwide concern regard possible level of overexploitation of some specie of tuna such as bluefin bigeye and yellowfin in the entire pacific ocean we seek to increase the coordination between our two organization this lead to the iattc at its last ordinary meeting hold in july of this year in guayaquil ecuador decide to send a respectful exhortation to the wcpfc to consider the following at its annual meeting in to strengthen cooperation with the iattc in the scientific area in order to improve their work dynamic jointly use similar assessment model for analyze the status of all the share stock of tropical tuna in the pacific ocean as a whole to identify difference in characteristic and structure of purseseine operation and stock dynamic in the central and western pacific and eastern pacific to develop management measure such as a total closure of catch for the purseseine fishery for skipjack bigeye and yellowfin tuna whereby the operation of the fleet be totally stop in order to achieve great efficiency of the measure for the sustainability of these specie throughout the pacific ocean the number and timing of day of closure should be base on the good available science the wcpfc could consider make appropriate adjustment to other exist conservation and management measure if a total closure be adopt to work in the development of a coordinate rebuilding and management plan for the bluefin tuna stock the iattc shall ask the wcpfc for a joint meeting with all interested party after the stock assessment by the isc be carry out in 2016 in order to adopt equivalent point of reference,Governance

WCPFC12-2015-OP16,9.0,Taiwanese longliner engaged in illegal fishing shark finning3 and transshipment on the high seas Transshipment and the use of motherships to resupply fishing vessels at sea also facilitates forced labour and human rights abuse at sea by allowing fishing vessels to stay at sea for months and even years making escape impossible for fishing crews It also exacerbates the extremely low level of observer coverage on longline vessels by making observer trips difficult to implement and allowing longline vessels to avoid port inspection from landing catches in port or transshipping in authorised transshipment ports where inspection is possible The impacts of transshipment at sea are clear and as a result tuna traders and consumers cannot be sure that their longline tuna is caught legally and without the use of forced labour The commission must live up to its obligation to adopt compatible measures for the high seas and follow Pacific Islands and Indonesias lead in EEZ transshipment bans by adopting a ban on transshipment at sea across the full convention area Adopt a moratorium on targeted fishing for Pacific bluefin tuna Given the dire state of the Pacific bluefin tuna population it is a matter of urgency that the Commission agrees to a moratorium on all targeted fishing for Pacific bluefin tuna until such time that a Pacificwide management plan is agreed and implemented and the stock has shown conclusive evidence of recovery to levels above an agreed biomass limit reference point Adopt interim target reference points TRPs of 50 SB for skipjack bigeye and yellowfin and 45 for albacore until final TRPs are agreed by the Commission by 2017 Strengthening the current shark finning measure CMM 201405 to prohibit both methods of shark targeting wire leaders and shark lines beneath buoys The use of shark lines is difficult to verify unless vessels are witnessed retrieving the lines from beneath buoys so vessels may be violating this measure without detection Strengthen CMM 201007 to require sharks be retained with their fins naturally attached This is international best practise as set out in the UN General Assembly resolution 62177 Enforcing the 5 ratio when fins may be stored detached and even transhipped separately from carcasses is extremely difficult as recently documented by Greenpeace on board the Shuen De Ching 888 vessel This loophole compromises other CMMs including those for oceanic whitetip and silky sharks In addition transhipment of sharks and fins separately is currently allowed under CMM 201007 which compounds the difficulty in enforcing the relevant shark measures This further reiterates the call by Greenpeace to ban all transhipment at sea of all species including sharks to close this loophole and support strong fisheries management good data reporting and science and enforcement of the rules Strengthen the Commissions response to noncompliance and IUU fishing by ensuring that transparency is restored to this process and compliance documents are made available Greenpeace recommends that the annual assessment of obligations is focused on priorities identified using a risk based approach For the 2015

WCPFC13-2016-OP02,2.0,Paper by The PEW Charitable Trusts A brief from Dec 2016 Recommendations to the 13th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission9 December 2016 Nadi Fiji Overview The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC has a mandate to sustainably manage and ensure longterm conservation of all highly migratory fish stocks including tunas and sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean However the Commissions handling of some migratory fish stocks currently falls short of that mandate and global expectations of best practices though the WCPFC Convention text incorporates relatively modern principles of fisheries management Despite strong scientific and management advice to the Commission the conservation and management measures CMMs now in place are inadequate to end or prevent overfishing of some key stocks Two of the six commercial tuna stocks managed by WCPFCPacific bluefin and bigeye tunacontinue to be fished unsustainably In addition while some progress has been made on the conservation and management of sharks much more is needed to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of sharks is sustainable Ensuring sustainable fisheries in the WCPFC Convention Area requires strong conservation and management actions and strict compliance with measures already adopted The Pew Charitable Trusts urges all Commission Members Cooperating NonMembers and Participating Territoriesknown collectively as CCMsto cooperate and compromise in order to Adopt elements of the harvest strategy approach that would specify measurable management objectives ensure that the risk of breaching limit reference points is no greater than 10 percent and rebuild Pacific bigeye to its limit reference point within six to eight years Immediately implement a twoyear moratorium on all commercial fishing for Pacific bluefin tuna Effectively manage fish aggregating devices FADs Adopt timely electronic reporting and electronic monitoring standards that meet existing requirements for scientific data provision and compliance Ban transshipment at sea until authorities can ensure that it is verifiable and legal Consider sciencebased catch limits and improve data collection for sharks Implement a complete ban of wire trace and shark lines Ensure that all targeted shark fisheries provide comprehensive management plans Prohibit retention of manta and mobula rays and adopt live release guidance for these species Task a small working group to develop a port State measures CMM that can be considered by the Commission in 2017 Establish a procedure that permits the addition of vessels found to be engaged in illegal unreported and unregulated fishing to the IUU vessel list between annual meetings Improve transparency in Commission processes by allowing observer access to compliance monitoring scheme discussions Recommendations Adopt harvest strategies to protect healthy stocks and rebuild overfished stocks and effectively manage fish aggregating devices Fisheries management in the western and central Pacific must take into consideration the importance of various stocks to the economies of the region and the wellbeing of the marine ecosystem In 2014 catches of tuna in the region totaled about 285 million metric tons with an estimated value of more than US2268 billion at the final point of sale That represents 57 percent of the global tuna catch1 The Commissions current approach to fisheries management is not adequate to preserve that value or the sustainability of the stocks Healthy stocks such as skipjackwhich in 2014 accounted for 68 percent of the catch in the region with a value of 23 billionshould be managed with a longterm view rather than to maximize shortterm gains Meanwhile depleted and overfished stocks of Pacific bluefin and bigeye tuna require urgent action beyond business as usual Ensure the adoption of welldesigned harvest strategies Members of the Commission face important decisions that will determine the degree to which harvest strategies designed in the western and central Pacific are suitably precautionary and promote the longterm sustainability of the stocks Adoption of CMM 201406 two years ago committed the Commission to developing and implementing a sixpart harvest strategy approach for each of the key tuna stocks Last year the Commission followed that decision by adopting a workplan that established timelines for decisionmaking Separately the WCPFC Chair has circulated a concept paper to adopt a bridging CMM for the transition from the tropical tuna measure that expires in 2017 to implementation of harvest strategies Harvest strategies are the next innovation in fisheries management If designed correctly they benefit both the fish and fishermen Reflecting the importance of these stocks the Commission should adhere to the timelines in the harvest strategy workplan to Record2 stockspecific management objectives that set measurable goals including Target reference points should be met with 80 percent or greater likelihood Biological objectives such as maintaining stocks at levels that promote sustainability should be given greater weight than other objectives Adopt acceptable levels of risk of breaching limit reference points that are no more than 10 percent3 and in the case of Pacific bigeye 5 percent to recognize the need to minimize the likelihood these stocks will fall into the danger zone Adopt a timeline to rebuild Pacific bigeye to its limit reference point in six to eight yearsa goal that is achievable given the biological characteristics of the stockas an interim step to rebuilding the stock to a target reference point set to be agreed upon in 2017 Adopt a precautionary target reference point for South Pacific albacore Endorse the concept of a bridging measure to manage the transition from the tropical tuna CMM that expires in 2017 to implementation of harvest strategies Specify a plan to agree on details to be included in the measure Immediately implement a 2year moratorium on all commercial fishing for Pacific bluefin tuna The latest stock assessment for Pacific bluefin tuna released in 2016 found that nearly a century of overfishing has depleted the population to just 26 percent of its historic unfished size Despite this 97 percent decline the CMM recommended by the Northern Committee would not end overfishing or implement key elements of a longterm harvest strategy for the species In fact an addition to the proposed measure would allow the catch of large bluefin to increase despite scientific projections showing that there is a less than 1 percent chance that the population will recover under current management measures The full WCPFC Commission and its members have the ultimate responsibility for fulfilling the Convention mandate to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield In light of the failure of the Northern Committee to recommend a CMM that would meet this mandate the Commission should Not accept the Northern Committee recommendations and return the matter to the Committee for consideration of appropriate management measures that would end overfishing fulfill the mandates of the Convention and CMM 201406 and rebuild the population to healthy levels Implement an initial twoyear moratorium on commercial fishing of Pacific bluefin that would be extended until the Commission Agrees on a recovery plan that will rebuild the population to 20SSBcurrent F0 within eight years two generations time as per best practice and then allows the stock to recover further to a target reference point of at least 40 SBcurrent F0 by 2030 Adopts limit reference points for Pacific bluefin of at least 20SBcurrent F0 and a related Flimit point Limit reference points should be defined as the points at which if breached the fishery will be suspended and scientific monitoring will be instituted until the population returns to the limits Adopts target reference points for Pacific bluefin of at least 40 SBcurrent F0 and a related Ftarget point to provide an appropriate buffer to avoid breaching the limit reference points Adopts harvest control rules that lead to a less than 5 percent chance of breaching the limit reference points and that have at least a 90 percent chance of achieving the target reference points The Pacific bluefin population will not recover under current measures and without additional help If the measures noted above are not in place by 2018 an international trade ban through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES listing should be pursued as the only remaining option to safeguard the species Effectively manage fish aggregating devices Developing measures to effectively manage FADs must be an urgent priority for the Commission and part of a balanced strategy to reduce fishing mortality among juvenile and adult bigeye Nearly all bigeye harvested by purse seine vessels are juvenile fish taken around FADs The impact can be seen in the mortality rate for juveniles which was twice that of adults in the 2014 assessment4 the most recent full assessment for the stock Bigeye mortality decreased in the purse seine fishery in 2015 but the conditions that brought that about were not linked to stock management Oceanographic conditions associated with a strong El Nino may have made bigeye less available in the eastern portion of the Convention Area5 In addition some key purse seine fleets did not fish as much as they had in recent years though they may return to higher levels of effort Still even with the unique circumstances of 2015 scientists estimated that the stock continued to experience overfishing and remained overfished at about 16 percent of its unfished spawning biomass That is below the WCPFC limit reference point of 20 percent of unfished spawning biomass The need to adopt measures to directly reduce and manage juvenile mortality remains urgent With the tropical tuna CMM expiring in 2017 the Commission this year should Review the progress of the FAD Working Group and request further development of management options to directly control the catch of bigeye in the purse seine fishery Those management options should specify clear steps and timelines and lead to a recommendation to the Commissions annual meeting in 2017 Adopt a FAD research plan to inform management decisions which includes analyses of bigeye hot spots and how vessel characteristics influence bigeye catches Agree on a plan to physically mark FADs with unique codes to improve data collection considering the recommendations in the consultants report on FAD marking and identification Adopt electronic reporting and electronic monitoring standards Tuna longline fisheries in the western and central Pacific are not effectively managed today in part because current mechanisms and policies do not ensure sufficient and timely submission of critical data In 2014 longline vessels caught fish with an end value of almost 4 billion in these waters6 Given the economic contributions of that sector of the fishery resource managers should be motivated to ensure its longterm sustainability by addressing gaps in the timely and accurate tracking of longline fishing catch and effort Promising new technologies can make required reporting and monitoring much faster and more effective Information on catches can be relayed in near realtime in more standardized formats using electronic reporting ER systems In addition the WCPFC can expand observer coverage requirements with limited additional onboard personnel by using proven electronic monitoring EM technology Technological advances coupled with the increasing costeffectiveness of ER and EM systems can help improve fisheries management and ensure high levels of compliance with conservation and management measures Near realtime electronic catch reporting improves accountability and accuracy benefiting authorities fishing boat owners and associated industries alike For these reasons and more many WCPFC member countries have already embraced these technologies as effective management tools for their domestic fisheries and more are likely to follow Pew calls on members of the WCPFC to Adopt electronic reporting and electronic monitoring standards that meet existing scientific data provision and compliance requirements to allow interested CCMs to commence reporting electronically in a manner aligned with WCPFC requirements Adopt guidelines on EM program components including steps to ensure that EM coverage equates to coverage under the Regional Observer Program Require 100 percent electronic reporting to improve timeliness and accuracy of catch reporting Adopt strategies and time frames for the design and implementation of electronic reporting and monitoring systems including training programs and how best to ensure longterm operational sustainability Require 100 percent observer coverage on longline vessels as now required on purse seine vessels by complementing onboard human observers with electronic monitoring for science and compliance Ban transshipment at sea until it can be ensured that it does not contribute to IUU activity Illegal unreported and misreported transshipment at sea particularly within the longline sector contributes significantly to IUU activity unless the movement of catch from vessel to vessel is adequately regulated and controlled Within the western and central Pacific Ocean region alone an estimated 142 million a year of tuna and tunalike product is involved in illegal atsea transshipment activities Pew has advocated for regional fishery management organizations RFMOs to ban all forms of atsea transshipment of fish until there is clear evidence that such operations are legal and verifiable and do not contribute to IUU fishing Verification remains difficult Although there is a 100 percent observer coverage requirement on carrier vessels the WCPFC Secretariat does not currently receive reports from carrier observers nor does it maintain a database for this information That means that no cross verification can be done of seafood product reportedly transshipped between vessels on the high seas Data and information on transshipment are collected and relayed to various entities but no single body including the WCPFC Secretariat maintains a full and complete picture of this activity from the point of catch to the point of offloading As such additional controls to ensure full and effective monitoring of transshipments at sea are needed Some RFMOs have banned transshipment at sea for some authorized vessels such as purse seiners or small scale longline vessels demonstrating that such bans are feasible and economically viable WCPFC member countries have championed similar provisions for the longline sector or called for complete transshipment bans but so far the Commission has not been able to implement the measures needed to fully control transshipment at sea Pew calls on members of the WCPFC to Ban transshipment at sea until it can be ensured that it is verifiable and legal Among other actions guidelines should be established to determine the impracticability for certain vessels to operate without being able to transship on the high seas As a first step establish formal observer reporting processes procedures and forms for observers on carrier vessels to ensure that every high seas transshipment reported via declarations can be cross validated by the Secretariat as to species quantity and location Strengthen conservation and management of sharks About 100 million sharks an unsustainable number are caught and killed in commercial fisheries each year7 Whether this catch is highly sought after or unintended and unwanted managers must take immediate action to stop the decline in shark populations and mitigate the damage that causes to marine ecosystems Until measures are in place to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of sharks is sustainable harvest of these animals should be avoided Those caught should be released alive whenever possible Fishing gear that increases the likelihood of shark catch such as wire leaders and shark lines should be prohibited and research should be done to determine the best means of avoiding shark catch If CCMs are to continue to target sharks or to catch sharks as bycatch then the Commission must enact management measures that reflect the precautionary principle In instances where limited population data for shark species result in uncertain stock assessment results managers must implement precautionary measures such as catch limits that can safeguard these vulnerable stocks The Commission also should require that fins be naturally attached when sharks are landed Adopting this global standard would allow for better enforcement of the WCPFC prohibition on shark finning Such measures would ensure that all sharks in the Convention Area are sustainably caught and that WCPFC fisheries are not contributing to the global overfishing of sharks Consider sciencebased catch limits and improve data collection for sharks Stock assessment analyses of shark species are often limited by inadequate datasets which make it more difficult to formulate comprehensive scientific advice For example a limited number of available data sets severely constrained the recent assessment of the South Pacific blue shark As a result at its 2016 meeting the Scientific Committee noted that no management advice could be provided for this stock In order to safeguard blue sharks until a more reliable assessment can be conducted the Commission must implement a precautionary cap of effort at current levels Additionally improvements to data recording and reporting on the catch of shark species will help ensure sustainable fishing of stocks Pew calls on the Commission to Consider capping the fishing effort for blue sharks at current levels Expand observer coverage for longline fleets operating in the Convention Area Consider the adoption of a no data no fish measure for sharks which would prohibit CCMs that do not submit landing data on key shark species from retaining shark catches Prohibit the use of wire trace and shark lines CMM 201308 and CMM 201104 prohibit retention of silky sharks and oceanic whitetip sharks in the Convention Area The Commission implemented these measures to drastically reduce fishing mortality of these highly vulnerable species However a separate measure CMM 201405 allows the choice of using either wire trace or shark lines which undermines these efforts Removing the choice of gear and imposing a ban of both gear types would reduce fishingrelated mortality by 24 percent for silky sharks and 37 percent for oceanic whitetip sharks8 Pew urges the Commission to Implement a complete ban on wire trace and shark lines to reduce catch of silky and oceanic whitetip sharks Ensure that all targeted shark fisheries provide comprehensive management plans Having clearly defined components in a shark management plan can safeguard highly vulnerable stocks and ensure an acceptable level of fishing mortality for all shark species caught Pew urges the Commission to Consider the components of a targeted shark fishery management plan recommended by the Scientific Committee in 2016 and propose a clear timeline for the review of submitted plans Prohibit retention of manta and mobula rays and adopt live release guidance The family Mobulidae which includes manta rays and mobula rays is extremely vulnerable to overfishing Observer reports show that manta and mobula rays are often killed as bycatch in WCPFC purse seine fisheries metric tons were recorded from 1994 to 20099 WCPFC13 should strongly consider the 2016 Scientific Committee advice and recommend that purse seine observer training programs emphasize species identification of Mobulid rays Pew urges the Commission to Consider banning the retention of manta and mobula rays and implement the Scientific Committees 2016 recommendation to adopt guidelines for safe release of such rays when caught incidentally in WCPFC fisheries Enhance CCM transparency and accountability Adopt minimum standards for port inspections Port State measures PSMs are costeffective tools to monitor compliance with management arrangements and prevent illegal fish from entering the market PSM proposals have been considered by the Commission for several years and also were recommended as part of the WCPFC Performance Review in 2013 Recent efforts to adopt a CMM on Port State Measures to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing have fallen short but the entry into force this year of the international Port States Measures Agreement should provide a strong basis for establishing a regional scheme within the WCPFC In addition the Commissions Technical and Compliance Committee this year discussed the paper produced by the Secretariat10 that summarizes measures adopted by other RFMOs The Commission must move toward adopting a formal port State measures CMM Pew urges the Commission to Adopt a port State measures CMM as soon as possible If there is no agreement at the annual meeting task a small working group to develop text on a port State measures CMM that can be considered by the Technical and Compliance Committee in 2017 and formally adopted by the Commission next year Enhance the effectiveness of the IUU vessel list Placing a vessel on WCPFCs IUU vessel list helps to highlight and ultimately deter unacceptable practices in the Convention Area However the effectiveness of this list is diminished because vessels found to be engaged in IUU fishing can only be added once a year As a result IUU vessels operate unhindered until the Commission meets and CCMs put them on the list The WCPFC permits vessels to be removed from the IUU vessel list between annual meetings In the same spirit the Commission should permit the listing of IUU vessels intersessionally Pew calls on members of the WCPFC to Establish a procedure that permits the addition of vessels found to be engaged in IUU fishing to the IUU vessel list between annual meetings Compliance monitoring scheme and transparency The Second Joint Meeting of Tuna RFMOs in 2009 recommended that organizations develop robust compliance review mechanisms so that the records of each member of the Commission could be examined on an annual basis As a result the WCPFC established a Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS to ensure that CCMs meet their obligations The CMS is designed to assess CCM compliance It also helps identify areas where technical assistance or capacity building may be needed and determine aspects of conservation and management measures that require refinement or amendment for effective implementation When establishing the Compliance Monitoring Scheme CCMs said the process would be conducted in a responsible open transparent and nondiscriminatory manner Such a process would ensure that the Commission was aware of information relevant to efforts to identify instances of noncompliance and hold parties accountable To help meet transparency requirements detailed in Article 21 of the Convention and Rule of the Rules of Procedures the Commission should allow observer access to Compliance Monitoring Review discussions related to development of both Provisional and Final Compliance Monitoring Reports Pew urges the Commission to Improve transparency by formally adopting a process that will allow observer access to all discussions about the Compliance Monitoring Scheme related to development of CCM Compliance Monitoring Reports that occur at the Commission and the Technical and Compliance Committee meetings Contact Amanda Nickson

sustainability of the stock healthy stock such as skipjackwhich in 2014 account for 68 percent of the catch in the region with a value of 23 billionshould be manage with a longterm view rather than to maximize shortterm gain meanwhile deplete and overfished stock of pacific bluefin and bigeye tuna require urgent action beyond business as usual ensure the adoption of welldesigne harvest strategy member of the commission face important decision that will determine the degree to which harvest strategy design in the western and central pacific be suitably precautionary and promote the longterm sustainability of the stock adoption of cmm 201406 two year ago commit the commission to develop and implement a sixpart harvest strategy approach for each of the key tuna stock last year the commission follow that decision by adopt a workplan that establish timeline for decisionmake separately the wcpfc chair have circulate a concept paper to adopt a bridge cmm for the transition from the tropical tuna measure that expire in 2017 to implementation of harvest strategy harvest strategy be the next innovation in fishery management if design correctly they benefit both the fish and fisherman reflect the importance of these stock the commission should adhere to the timeline in the harvest strategy workplan to record2 stockspecific management objective that set measurable goal include target reference point should be meet with 80 percent or great likelihood biological objective such as maintain stock at level that promote sustainability should be give great weight than other objective adopt acceptable level of risk of breach limit reference point that be no more than 10 percent3 and in the case of pacific bigeye 5 percent to recognize the need to minimize the likelihood these stock will fall into the danger zone adopt a timeline to rebuild pacific bigeye to its limit reference point in six to eight yearsa goal that be achievable give the biological characteristic of the stockas an interim step to rebuild the stock to a target reference point set to be agree upon in 2017 adopt a precautionary target reference point for south pacific albacore endorse the concept of a bridge measure to manage the transition from the tropical tuna cmm that expire in 2017 to implementation of harvest strategy specify a plan to agree on detail to be include in the measure immediately implement a 2year moratorium on all commercial fishing for pacific bluefin tuna the late stock assessment for pacific bluefin tuna release in 2016 find that nearly a century of overfishing have deplete the population to just 26 percent of its historic unfished size despite this 97 percent decline the cmm recommend by the northern committee would not end overfishe or implement key element of a longterm harvest strategy for the specie in fact an addition to the propose measure would allow the catch of large bluefin to increase despite scientific projection show that there be a less than 1 percent chance that the population will recover under current management measure the full wcpfc commission and its member have the ultimate responsibility for fulfil the convention mandate to maintain or restore stock at level capable of produce maximum sustainable yield in light of the failure of the northern committee to recommend a cmm that would meet this mandate the commission should not accept the northern committee recommendation and return the matter to the committee for consideration of appropriate management measure that would end overfishe fulfill the mandate of the convention and cmm 201406 and rebuild the population to healthy level implement an initial twoyear moratorium on commercial fishing of pacific bluefin that would be extend until the commission agree on a recovery plan that will rebuild the population to 20ssbcurrent f0 within eight year two generation time as per good practice and then allow the stock to recover far to a target reference point of at least 40 sbcurrent f0 by 2030 adopt limit reference point for pacific bluefin of at least 20sbcurrent f0 and a relate flimit point limit reference point should be define as the point at which if breach the fishery will be suspend and scientific monitoring will be institute until the population return to the limit adopts target reference point for pacific bluefin of at least 40 sbcurrent f0 and a related ftarget point to provide an appropriate buffer to avoid breach the limit reference point adopt harvest control rule that lead to a less than 5 percent chance of breach the limit reference point and that have at least a 90 percent chance of achieve the target reference point the pacific bluefin population will not recover under current measure and without additional help if the measure note above be not in place by 2018 an international trade ban through the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cite listing should be pursue as the only remaining option to safeguard the specie effectively manage fish aggregate device develop measure to effectively manage fad must be an urgent priority for the commission and part of a balanced strategy to reduce fishing mortality among juvenile and adult bigeye nearly all bigeye harvest by purse seine vessel be juvenile fish take around fad the impact can be see in the mortality rate for juvenile which be twice that of adult in the 2014 assessment4 the most recent full assessment for the stock bigeye mortality decrease in the purse seine fishery in 2015 but the condition that bring that about be not link to stock management oceanographic condition associate with a strong el nino may have make bigeye less available in the eastern portion of the convention area5 in addition some key purse seine fleet do not fish as much as they have in recent year though they may return to high level of effort still even with the unique circumstance of 2015 scientist estimate that the stock continue to experience overfishe and remain overfished at about 16 percent of its unfished spawning biomass that be below the wcpfc limit reference point of 20 percent of unfished spawn biomass the need to adopt measure to directly reduce and manage juvenile mortality remain urgent with the tropical tuna cmm expire in 2017 the commission this year should review the progress of the fad working group and request further development of management option to directly control the catch of bigeye in the purse seine fishery those management option should specify clear step and timeline and lead to a recommendation to the commissions annual meeting in 2017 adopt a fad research plan to inform management decision which include analysis of bigeye hot spot and how vessel characteristic influence bigeye catch agree on a plan to physically mark fad with unique code to improve data collection consider the recommendation in the consultant report on fad marking and identification adopt electronic reporting and electronic monitoring standard tuna longline fishery in the western and central pacific be not effectively manage today in part because current mechanism and policy do not ensure sufficient and timely submission of critical datum in 2014 longline vessel catch fish with an end value of almost 4 billion in these waters6 give the economic contribution of that sector of the fishery resource manager should be motivate to ensure its longterm sustainability by address gap in the timely and accurate tracking of longline fishing catch and effort promise new technology can make required reporting and monitor much fast and more effective information on catch can be relay in near realtime in more standardized format use electronic reporting er system in addition the wcpfc can expand observer coverage requirement with limited additional onboard personnel by use prove electronic monitoring em technology technological advance couple with the increase costeffectiveness of er and em system can help improve fishery management and ensure high level of compliance with conservation and management measure near realtime electronic catch reporting improve accountability and accuracy benefit authority fishing boat owner and associate industry alike for these reason and more many wcpfc member country have already embrace these technology as effective management tool for their domestic fishery and more be likely to follow pew call on member of the wcpfc to adopt electronic reporting and electronic monitoring standard that meet exist scientific datum provision and compliance requirement to allow interested ccm to commence reporting electronically in a manner align with wcpfc requirement adopt guideline on em program component include step to ensure that em coverage equate to coverage under the regional observer program require 100 percent electronic reporting to improve timeliness and accuracy of catch report adopt strategy and time frame for the design and implementation of electronic reporting and monitoring system include training program and how good to ensure longterm operational sustainability require 100 percent observer coverage on longline vessel as now require on purse seine vessel by complement onboard human observer with electronic monitoring for science and compliance ban transshipment at sea until it can be ensure that it do not contribute to iuu activity illegal unreported and misreported transshipment at sea particularly within the longline sector contribute significantly to iuu activity unless the movement of catch from vessel to vessel be adequately regulate and control within the western and central pacific ocean region alone an estimate 142 million a year of tuna and tunalike product be involve in illegal atsea transshipment activity pew have advocate for regional fishery management organization rfmo to ban all form of atsea transshipment of fish until there be clear evidence that such operation be legal and verifiable and do not contribute to iuu fish verification remain difficult although there be a 100 percent observer coverage requirement on carrier vessel the wcpfc secretariat do not currently receive report from carrier observer nor do it maintain a database for this information that mean that no cross verification can be do of seafood product reportedly transship between vessel on the high seas data and information on transshipment be collect and relay to various entity but no single body include the wcpfc secretariat maintain a full and complete picture of this activity from the point of catch to the point of offloading as such additional control to ensure full and effective monitoring of transshipment at sea be need some rfmo have ban transshipment at sea for some authorize vessel such as purse seiner or small scale longline vessel demonstrate that such ban be feasible and economically viable wcpfc member country have champion similar provision for the longline sector or call for complete transshipment ban but so far the commission have not be able to implement the measure need to fully control transshipment at sea pew call on member of the wcpfc to ban transshipment at sea until it can be ensure that it be verifiable and legal among other action guideline should be establish to determine the impracticability for certain vessel to operate without be able to transship on the high sea as a first step establish formal observer report process procedure and form for observer on carrier vessel to ensure that every high sea transshipment report via declaration can be cross validate by the secretariat as to species quantity and location strengthen conservation and management of shark about 100 million shark an unsustainable number be catch and kill in commercial fishery each year7 whether this catch be highly seek after or unintended and unwanted manager must take immediate action to stop the decline in shark population and mitigate the damage that cause to marine ecosystem until measure be in place to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of shark be sustainable harvest of these animal should be avoid those catch should be release alive whenever possible fishing gear that increase the likelihood of shark catch such as wire leader and shark line should be prohibit and research should be do to determine the good mean of avoid shark catch if ccm be to continue to target shark or to catch shark as bycatch then the commission must enact management measure that reflect the precautionary principle in instance where limited population datum for shark specie result in uncertain stock assessment result manager must implement precautionary measure such as catch limit that can safeguard these vulnerable stock the commission also should require that fin be naturally attach when shark be land adopt this global standard would allow for well enforcement of the wcpfc prohibition on shark fin such measure would ensure that all shark in the convention area be sustainably catch and that wcpfc fishery be not contribute to the global overfishing of shark consider sciencebase catch limit and improve datum collection for shark stock assessment analysis of shark specie be often limit by inadequate dataset which make it more difficult to formulate comprehensive scientific advice for example a limited number of available data set severely constrain the recent assessment of the south pacific blue shark as a result at its 2016 meeting the scientific committee note that no management advice could be provide for this stock in order to safeguard blue shark until a more reliable assessment can be conduct the commission must implement a precautionary cap of effort at current level additionally improvement to datum recording and reporting on the catch of shark specie will help ensure sustainable fishing of stock pew call on the commission to consider cap the fishing effort for blue shark at current level expand observer coverage for longline fleet operate in the convention area consider the adoption of a no datum no fish measure for shark which would prohibit ccm that do not submit landing datum on key shark specie from retain shark catch prohibit the use of wire trace and shark line cmm 201308 and cmm 201104 prohibit retention of silky shark and oceanic whitetip shark in the convention area the commission implement these measure to drastically reduce fishing mortality of these highly vulnerable specie however a separate measure cmm 201405 allow the choice of use either wire trace or shark line which undermine these effort remove the choice of gear and impose a ban of both gear type would reduce fishingrelated mortality by 24 percent for silky shark and 37 percent for oceanic whitetip sharks8 pew urge the commission to implement a complete ban on wire trace and shark line to reduce catch of silky and oceanic whitetip shark ensure that all target shark fishery provide comprehensive management plan having clearly define component in a shark management plan can safeguard highly vulnerable stock and ensure an acceptable level of fishing mortality for all shark specie catch pew urge the commission to consider the component of a target shark fishery management plan recommend by the scientific committee in 2016 and propose a clear timeline for the review of submit plan prohibit retention of manta and mobula ray and adopt live release guidance the family mobulidae which include manta ray and mobula ray be extremely vulnerable to overfishe observer report show that manta and mobula ray be often kill as bycatch in wcpfc purse seine fishery metric ton be record from 1994 to 20099 wcpfc13 should strongly consider the 2016 scientific committee advice and recommend that purse seine observer training program emphasize specie identification of mobulid ray pew urge the commission to consider ban the retention of manta and mobula ray and implement the scientific committees 2016 recommendation to adopt guideline for safe release of such ray when catch incidentally in wcpfc fishery enhance ccm transparency and accountability adopt minimum standard for port inspection port state measure psm be costeffective tool to monitor compliance with management arrangement and prevent illegal fish from enter the market psm proposal have be consider by the commission for several year and also be recommend as part of the wcpfc performance review in 2013 recent effort to adopt a cmm on port state measures to prevent deter and eliminate illegal unreported and unregulated fishing have fall short but the entry into force this year of the international port states measures agreement should provide a strong basis for establish a regional scheme within the wcpfc in addition the commissions technical and compliance committee this year discuss the paper produce by the secretariat10 that summarize measure adopt by other rfmo the commission must move toward adopt a formal port state measure cmm pew urge the commission to adopt a port state measure cmm as soon as possible if there be no agreement at the annual meeting task a small working group to develop text on a port state measure cmm that can be consider by the technical and compliance committee in 2017 and formally adopt by the commission next year enhance the effectiveness of the iuu vessel list place a vessel

fishing can only be add once a year as a result iuu vessel operate unhindered until the commission meet and ccms put they on the list the wcpfc permit vessel to be remove from the iuu vessel list between annual meeting in the same spirit the commission should permit the listing of iuu vessel intersessionally pew call on member of the wcpfc to establish a procedure that permit the addition of vessel find to be engage in iuu fish to the iuu vessel list between annual meeting compliance monitoring scheme and transparency the second joint meeting of tuna rfmo in 2009 recommend that organization develop robust compliance review mechanism so that the record of each member of the commission could be examine on an annual basis as a result the wcpfc establish a compliance monitoring

WCPFC13-2016-OP03,6.0,Reports from the WCPFC Technical and Compliance Committee TCC12 indicated that finning is still rife within WCPO waters with many CCMs failing to comply with existing shark CMMs It is imperative that action is taken to end the wasteful practice of shark finning and associated lack of accounting of shark mortality that results In October this year silky sharks three species of thresher sharks and all nine species of mobula rays were included within Appendix II of CITES which places a greater emphasis on RFMOs to ensure catches are reported accurately to meet CITES reporting obligations WWF recommends the WCPFC Develop endorse and recommend adoption of a Comprehensive Shark CMM that includes efforts to o Mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs o Implement the recommendations for bycatch that were endorsed at Kobe III and adopt an annually updated report card system against these recommendations for all of the WCPFC fisheries o Require through data collected from observer programs and other means estimation of the number of captures and releases of all sharks and rays including the status upon release dead or alive and reporting of this information to the WCPFC o Review and amend CMM 201405 to prohibit vessels carrying wire trace and the use branch lines and o Require through observer programs recording what gear is used in longline activities including the use of wire traces and any multi monofilament traces in order to avoid biteoff by sharks Provide definitions for mobula and manta rays to be considered as a key shark species Encourage the development of reference points and management for nontarget species including all shark and ray species as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention CCMs fully support proposals to land sharks with fins naturally attached as the only way to ensure shark finning does not occur and Encourage CCMs to report all shark and ray catches from domestic fleets operating in territorial and archipelagic waters to assist CCMs to meet obligations for

WCPFC13-2016-OP03,7.0,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 13th Regular Session Nadi Fiji 59 December 2016 WWF commends the WCPFCs swift and decisive action to lead the world in addressing issues with observer safety and security through the adoption of several key provisions at WCPFC12 WWF supports further efforts to ensure observer safety and security through the full and transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents One of the outstanding gaps in observer safety and security is represented by the lack of information available to address observer incidents through proper followup and documentation that will allow for identification of repeat offenders or potentially dangerous situations for future observers Thus WWF recommends establishing an immediate and transparent reporting procedure for observers to report instances of threats harrassment intimidation or assault that national programmes and the ROP could then use to determine future observer placement This procedure must include an annual publicly available consolidated detailed and fully transparent report of all infractions against observers WWF also welcomes the proposal on flag state responsibilities in the event of alleged observer safety concern offered by the United States which was discussed at length in the TCC12 in both working group and plenary sessions This proposal helps ensure that flag and coastal states fully understand their roles and responsibilities in the event of an observer safety and security concern WWF notes that observer coverage on longline vessels operating in the WCPO regardless of the metrics used to calculate it remains substantially less than 5 regionwide Moreover WWF wishes to emphasise that the 5 observer coverage value identified by the WCPFC represents an arbitrary benchmark that was never intended to represent an end goal but rather a minimum starting point toward appropriate observer coverage Even a consistently applied level of 5 coverage is statistically and practically useless for most management or monitoring control and surveillance MCS purposes Therefore WWF supports efforts to improve the observer coverage of all longline fisheries in the WCPO As such WWF supports calculating observer coverage according to the proposed hierarchy of four metrics for assessing observer coverage but notes that best practice would be to use number of hooks deployed as an appropriate metric If other metrics for calculating coverage are used terms must be very clearly defined in advance and each metric must be calculated in a way to be comparable to the other metrics WWF also notes that different levels of observer coverage may be required for management or compliance purposes depending on specific identified objectives and recommends that appropriate analyses be conducted to determine each of those levels respectively in the context of identified objectives Overall the level of observer coverage on longline vessels must be increased immediately and substantially greater than 5 to achieve any meaningful management and compliance objectives8 Transhipment remains one of the most prominent weaknesses in catch documentation and verification that leads to Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU catch in the WCPO WWF notes that the most simple efficient and effective solution to the challenges of transhipmentrelated IUU is to simply prohibit all atsea transhipment and require all fishing vessels to land their catch at the nearest available designated port in the WCPO following the conclusion of fishing activity However acknowledging that a prohibition on transhipment is politically unlikely at this point WWF supports an unequivocal 100 observer monitoring requirement for all transhipments in all WCPFC CA waters subject to strong sanctions for noncompliance WWF also recommends that transhipment requirements be buttressed by verification and validation of transhipment activities through redundant systems including a vessel monitoring system VMS supplemented by an operating automated identification system AIS If through investigation of suspected unreported transhipment activity indicated by VMS and corroborated by AIS it is determined that transhipment activity was conducted in violation of transhipment rules the offending,wwf position statement to the wcpfc 13th regular session nadi fiji 59 december 2016 wwf commend the wcpfcs swift and decisive action to lead the world in address issue with observer safety and security through the adoption of several key provision at wcpfc12 wwf support further effort to ensure observer safety and security through the full and transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incident one of the outstanding gap in observer safety and security be represent by the lack of information available to address observer incident through proper followup and documentation that will allow for identification of repeat offender or potentially dangerous situation for future observer thus wwf recommend establish an immediate and transparent reporting procedure for observer to report instance of threat harrassment intimidation or assault that national programme and the rop could then use to determine future observer placement this procedure must include an annual publicly available consolidate detailed and fully transparent

WCPFC13-2016-OP03,9.0,vessels should be subject to sanctions including license revocation and listing on the IUU vessel blacklist WWF recommends the WCPFC Endorse further observer safety and security measures including fully transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents and persons involved Endorse an analysis of levels of observer coverage required to achieve management or compliance purposes while ensuring that the metrics and methodologies used support development of appropriate comparative analyses that meet the needs of the Scientific Services Provider and any MCS objectives Adopt the proposal for flag state requirements for observer safety and security Support or endorse the use of VMS and AIS to verify and validate 100 observer coverage on all transhipments as well as supporting strong penalties and sanctions for violations and Notwithstanding deficiencies in observer coverage WWF views the issue of provision of historic and current operational data as critically important for the proper management of WCPFC stocks Thus WWF encourages the WCPFC to review the legal analysis presented at WCPFC12 on the Provision of Operational Data by Japan and Korea This analysis has since undergone peer review in a prominent legal journal and is available as WCPFC122015OP14 on the Commission website The conclusions of this analysis very clearly indicate that there is no domestic legal constraint for the provision of operational data for either Japan or Korea Therefore Japan and Korea are obligated to provide both historic and current operational data to the WCPFC consistent with several prior agreed CMMs dating back to 2005 WWF recommends the WCPFC Review the conclusions of WCPFC122015OP14 and Request the submission of all current and historic operational data by Japan and Korea Technical reports of all scientific and management bodies responsible for management of the Pacific bluefin tuna stock including the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC and the IATTC indicate that the Pacific Bluefin tuna stock remains in extremely poor condition The ISC confirmed that overfishing continues even though the stock is heavily overfished and its spawning stock biomass has declined to as low as 26 of its unfished level9 This is a clear indicator that the stock is no longer in the status to support industrial fisheries and the management measures taken both in the Western and Central Pacific and in the Eastern Pacific have proven insufficient to conserve the biological integrity of this stock in timely manner The IATTC and WCPFC must take immediate actions and assume their share of responsibility The latest assessment conducted by ISC confirms that the stock is highly depleted that fishing mortality exceeds all reasonable proxies for Fmsy Without the robust and precautionary longterm rebuilding target the recovery of the stock may be further delayed if the current scenario of low recruitment continues which is heavily reliant on a major adult cohort in the population While the WCPFC adopted conservation measures calling for reductions in catch for Pacific bluefin tuna of 30 kg in size the stock requires conservation of all size classes of Pacific bluefin tuna in particular the,vessel should be subject to sanction include license revocation and

WCPFC13-2016-OP03,10.0,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 13th Regular Session Nadi Fiji 59 December 2016 spawning stocks Thus WWF supports raising the minimum size restriction to 85kg based on the best available scientific information and consideration of the precautionary principle WWF maintains deep concerns regarding this stock with an aim of restoring and rebuilding this ecologically sociologically and economically important fishery resource The current science strongly indicates that there is only one reproductive cohort that is reaching the end of its life Thus the continued reproductive success of the entire stock depends on the reproductive success of a single cohort leaving the stock in a critical situation that may seriously jeopardize recruitment WWF encourages close monitoring of fisheries and catch as well as completion of a revised stock assessment for Pacific bluefin in 2016 WWF urges both IATTC and WCPFC to adopt a longterm Pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan targeting at least 20SSB0 and harvest control rules that are well defined preagreed and contain mandatory actions for a determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points The WCPFC consistent with the best scientific information and consistent with its charge under the Convention to manage this stock must recommend that fishing mortality on Pacific bluefin tuna be urgently and substantially reduced in both juveniles and adults in order to reduce the risk of recruitment collapse and allow spawning stock to rebuild If sufficient management measures cannot be agreed in 2016 the WCPFC must recommend a moratorium on all harvest of Pacific bluefin until such measures are agreed WWF recommends that the WCPFC Agree to a

WCPFC13-2016-OP09,4.0,Greenpeace welcomes the opportunity to attend the 13th meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC as an observer In addition to this paper Greenpeace asks the Commission to note the statement and recommendations made to SC12 in Bali this year1 Building a skyscraper without foundations The Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPO and those who depend on its fish face a growing crisis The WCPFC is failing to deliver on its most basic objectives of ensuring fisheries for future generations In the worst examples key species have been fished down to critically low levels just 26 of the Pacific bluefin tuna 16 of bigeye tuna and 12 of North Pacific striped marlin populations remain There is little optimism for their recovery to healthy levels in a reasonable timeframe given the WCPFCs sustained track record of failing to agree adequate management plans and to ensure all Member and Cooperating Nonmembers States follow the rules Unfortunately it is clear from the positions adopted by many WCPFC Members that they show little interest in addressing these failures Getting back to basics Managing the variety of tuna billfish and shark fisheries taking place in such a vast ocean region as the WCPO is a complicated endeavour As a result WCPFC rules and the work carried out by the Commission are increasingly sophisticated and complex The amount of analysis carried out by the different supporting institutions in the region is massive This includes a heavy workload for scientists managers and administrative staff However in contrast to this increasing complexity and workload the basic elements required for successful management of fisheries in the region are absent Over the last few years fishing capacity and effort have continued to increase the analysis carried out by WCPFC Scientific SC and Technical and Compliance Committees TCC are plagued with references to data gaps as basic requirements for data provision and observer coverage are not met and there are clearly few if any deterrents for those who fail to comply with the rules Any progress being made fades in comparison with the consequences of these failures Basic elements of sound fisheries management include The availability of accurate and detailed data on the operations of fishing fleets The mechanisms to ensure that fishing capacity and effort are managed effectively including taking into account all factors which contribute to them Clear rules on biomass and fishing mortality limits and actions to be taken when these limits are exceeded Strict compliance with legal requirements both under the Convention and International Law Deterrent consequences for the lack of compliance with the above mentioned requirements Transparency in the work of the Commission allowing engagement of all stakeholders and civil society in particular A lack of data undermines all levels of management Year after year it is clear that key data to inform the work of the Commission is either not being collected or not being reported While improvements are being made progress is slow Data gaps have three main causes Data is not provided to the Commission despite existing obligations in that regard This includes operational catch and effort data2 transhipment practices3 observer coverage4 and data on shark catches5 Data is not provided or provided in an inconsistent manner due to unclear provisions This includes observer data6 or data on certain important species7 Poor clarity on provisions critical to data collection also affects observer coverage itself see below Data is not provided because it is not mandatory to do so even if such data are of critical importance to managing fisheries An example of this is the lack of complete information on the management of fishing capacity where accurate data are not required on most factors essential to assessing the efficiency of fishing vessels All of this has obvious implications on the management of fish stocks under the purview of the Commission and in its ability to evaluate the performance of agreed conservation and management measures for both target and bycatch species Undermining rules and data collection Independent observers on board fishing vessels collect vital data for science and detect non compliance for managers Conversely transhipment at sea undermines oversight of fisheries and facilitates human rights and labour violations in some of these fisheries The requirement for a minimum of 5 observer coverage on longliners has been in place since with a deadline of implementation on 20128 However even this low level is not being met9 and there are issues with the way such coverage is defined so that the levels reported by different fleets are inconsistent10 While observer coverage on purse seiners is 100 some reporting problems still need to be addressed11 Even if the required 5 level was met it is not considered high enough for the data collected to be statistically useful for assessing bycatch impacts scientists recommend a minimum of 20 coverage12 More concerning is that electronic monitoring may now be seen as a way to reach 5 coverage rather than a way to complement and enhance the current requirement to a much higher and more scientifically useful level13 Finally observer safety remains a problem in fisheries worldwide including at WCPFC Provisions agreed at WCPFC12 go some way to addressing concerns but without the means and tools for observers to increase their safety clarity on the responsibilities of flag States to deal with observer safety concerns and transparency in how incidents of bribery harassment and violence are reported and dealt with there remain considerable risks to observers and therefore the quality of data gathered by the observer programme Transhipment at sea continues to undermine the monitoring control and surveillance of fishing operations in the region14 Despite the requirement for observers aboard transport vessels to monitor transhipment reporting requirements for observer data for monitoring high seas transhipments have not been agreed and some data are being submitted on a voluntary basis and in a range of different formats15 Existing data from transhipments indicate a failure to comply with the prohibition of sharkfinning16 and while transhipment plays a role inadequate reporting provisions can mask sharkfinning practices17 Although it seems to have been the intention of the Commission to restrict high seas transhipment18 it allows exceptions and it is clear that particular members are determined to continue to make widespread use of this With almost half of the vessels in the region authorised to tranship in the high seas WCPFC should question to what extent an activity can be considered exceptional19 Transhipment also facilitates human rights and labour abuses by allowing vessels to remain at sea for long periods with little or no oversight or ability for crew to report concerns an issue that receives increasing public scrutiny but which WCPFC has not yet addressed Lack of transparency facilitates lack of compliance Strict deterrent consequences for the lack of compliance by Members and Cooperating Non Members and their vessels are required to ensure management measures are achieved Furthermore the availability of information on how compliance is monitored on noncompliance reporting and on the actions taken to deal with those responsible enables public evaluation and creates an added incentive for compliance due to a desire to avoid the adverse reputational and economic repercussions of breaking the rules The WCPFC suffers from substantial transparency problems that prevent meaningful participation of the public and observers non and intergovernmental organisations in its work with resulting inadequate incentives for compliance20 This recurring problem particularly with regard to closed sessions during TCC meetings has triggered a series of interventions and joint letters from NGOs in the recent past This goes against the transparency requirements detailed in the Convention21 and Rules of Procedures22 in addition to wellestablished best practice at RFMOs23 other Regional Fisheries Bodies and other international environmental agreements24 Fishing capacity must be reduced The everincreasing level of fishing capacity and effort25 in the region represents a fundamental failure to meet the Convention requirement to take measures to prevent or eliminate overfishing and excess fishing capacity and to ensure that levels of fishing effort do not exceed those commensurate with the sustainable use of fishery resources26 The increase in vessel numbers and other components of fishing capacity and effort in the region such as FADs and their role in increasing catch rates is a result of key decisions being left in the hands of private fishing companies Recent analysis on the purse seine sector demonstrates that overcapacity is substantial27 Without detailed information on fishing capacity and effort it is hard to ensure that fishing is kept within sustainable limits28 It is of great concern that after public commitments in 2009 by developed nations under the Kobe process29 to freeze their fishing capacity even though poorly defined as vessel numbers the WCPO fleet has continued to increase in terms of both number of vessels and vessel size30 with obvious implications in these fisheries31 In the WCPO 131 of the purse seiners and 428 of the longliners on the WCPFC Registered Vessel List were built after 200932 It is no less concerning that after such controversy over FADs many basic facts on their numbers and use remain unknown Appropriate data must be collected to measure and manage fishing capacity The purse seine industry has successfully opposed precautionary measures on FAD use with the excuse of the lack of information to determine suitable measures introducing instead socalled FAD Management Plans that should at a minimum provide the information required for informed management in the future The reality is that we still lack this data33 due both to the poor design of FAD management plans and to their requirements not being met34 The result overfishing and ecosystem impacts Pacific bluefin has been fished down to just 26 of its unfished population size35 and bigeye tuna to 1636 North Pacific striped marlin has been in a poor state for over 30 years now at just 12 with no action taken for recovery of the population37 Some other billfish populations are also significantly depleted South Pacific albacore continues to decline38 and the persistently low and declining average catch rates are likely to continue to undermine vessel profitability and may force some operators out of the fishery39 Again and in contravention to the precautionary approach enshrined in the WCPFC convention40 insufficient data is often cited as an excuse for further delaying the already slow process of agreeing harvest strategies for target species and often by members who are failing to meet their own data requirements However the continuing failure of the WCPFC to agree adequate measures without the preagreed goals and rules of harvest strategies means that further delaying this process is a continued threat to fish stocks41 Oceanic whitetip shark42 and silky shark43 populations have been devastated by both longliners and purse seiners and not enough data is available to assess other key shark species44 Meanwhile WCPFC parties continue to resist developing even the most basic Shark Management Plans Threatened albatrosses petrels and sea turtles continue to be killed as bestpractice bycatch mitigation measures are still not in place and again observer coverage and reporting requirements are not good enough to collect accurate data on these species WCPFC must address urgent data and compliance issues The following list encompasses priorities that must be addressed to ensure that further work by the SC and TCC and measures developed by WCPFC will not continue to be undermined Greenpeace calls on the Commission to Strengthen mandatory reporting requirements to ensure that fishing capacity and effort in all tuna billfish and shark fisheries are adequately measured and reported so as to allow for the best performance of the SC and a sound basis for Conservation and Management Measures Impose deterrent sanctions for cases of noncompliance to ensure that States comply with all their data reporting requirements such as No Data No Fishing measures of the type recently agreed at the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission IOTC45 Improve transparency and compliance by removing barriers to NGO and IGO observer access to the compliance monitoring processes and relevant documents and meetings Require a clearlydefined representative 20 observer coverage on longline fleets Where human onboard observers are not feasible for certain fleets or vessel sizes other alternatives such as electronic monitoring systems must be assessed and put in place subject to minimum technical requirements that ensure the reliability of the system These must not prevent the much needed increase in human observer coverage starting with ensuring that existing obligations are met Ensure the health and safety of all observers by developing robust safety and security measures and transparent reporting mechanisms for infractions and actions taken against any operators or crew members that harass intimidate harm or in any way prevent observers from performing their duties Improve and align vessel databases and the information fields they contain to ensure good data availability for capacity assessment Phase out all transhipment at sea In the interim all transhipment must have observers on board both the fishing and carrier vessels Any violation detected in transhipment must result in the loss of transhipment authorisation Consider FADs in context of capacity management and prioritise the collection of data on the number of FADs and the associated technology used and abandoned or lost by vessels in order to assess effort creep associated with FAD use and their impacts on juvenile tuna and shark populations Develop measures to improve the quality and quantity of data recorded and reported for all sharks caught including mobula and manta rays including details of the species gear types used and the condition of each animal on release dead injured alive This must include a requirement that all sharks are landed with their fins naturally attached Failure to report on shark catches should result in a ban on using sharkspecific gear and on retention of sharks Adopt the tiered approach to the development of shark management plans by all States as recommended by the paper presented at SC and TCC46,greenpeace welcome the opportunity to attend the 13th meeting of the western and central pacific fisheries

reporting provision can mask sharkfinne practices17 although it seem to have be the intention of the commission to restrict high sea transhipment18 it allow exception and it be clear that particular member be determined to continue to make widespread use of this with almost half of the vessel in the region authorise to tranship in the high sea wcpfc should question to what extent an activity can be consider exceptional19 transhipment also facilitate human right and labour abuse by allow vessel to remain at sea for long period with little or no oversight or ability for crew to report concern an issue that receive increase public scrutiny but which wcpfc have not yet address lack of transparency facilitate lack of compliance strict deterrent consequence for the lack of compliance by member and cooperating non members and their vessel be require to ensure management measure be achieve furthermore the availability of information on how compliance be monitor on noncompliance reporting and on the action take to deal with those responsible enable public evaluation and create an add incentive for compliance due to a desire to avoid the adverse reputational and economic repercussion of break the rule the wcpfc suffer from substantial transparency problem that prevent meaningful participation of the public and observer non and intergovernmental organisation in its work with result inadequate incentive for compliance20 this recur problem particularly with regard to close session during tcc meeting have trigger a series of intervention and joint letter from ngos in the recent past this go against the transparency requirement detail in the convention21 and rules of procedures22 in addition to wellestablished good practice at rfmos23 other regional fisheries bodies and other international environmental agreements24 fishing capacity must be reduce the everincreasing level of fishing capacity and effort25 in the region represent a fundamental failure to meet the convention requirement to take measure to prevent or eliminate overfishe and excess fishing capacity and to ensure that level of fishing effort do not exceed those commensurate with the sustainable use of fishery resources26 the increase in vessel number and other component of fishing capacity and effort in the region such as fad and their role in increase catch rate be a result of key decision be leave in the hand of private fishing company recent analysis on the purse seine sector demonstrate that overcapacity be substantial27 without detailed information on fishing capacity and effort it be hard to ensure that fishing be keep within sustainable limits28 it be of great concern that after public commitment in 2009 by develop nation under the kobe process29 to freeze their fishing capacity even though poorly define as vessel number the wcpo fleet have continue to increase in term of both number of vessel and vessel size30 with obvious implication in these fisheries31 in the wcpo 131 of the purse seiner and 428 of the longliner on the wcpfc registered vessel list be build after 200932 it be no less concern that after such controversy over fad many basic fact on their number and use remain unknown appropriate datum must be collect to measure and manage fishing capacity the purse seine industry have successfully oppose precautionary measure on fad use with the excuse of the lack of information to determine suitable measure introduce instead socalle fad management plan that should at a minimum provide the information require for informed management in the future the reality be that we still lack this data33 due both to the poor design of fad management plan and to their requirement not be met34 the result overfishe and ecosystem impact pacific bluefin have be fish down to just 26 of its unfished population size35 and bigeye tuna to 1636 north pacific stripe marlin have be in a poor state for over 30 year now at just 12 with no action take for recovery of the population37 some other billfish population be also significantly deplete south pacific albacore continue to decline38 and the persistently low and decline average catch rate be likely to continue to undermine vessel profitability and may force some operator out of the fishery39 again and in contravention to the precautionary approach enshrine in the wcpfc convention40 insufficient datum be often cite as an excuse for far delay the already slow process of agree harvest strategy for target specie and often by member who be fail to meet their own data requirement however the continue failure of the wcpfc to agree adequate measure without the preagreed goal and rule of harvest strategy mean that far delay this process be a continue threat to fish stocks41 oceanic whitetip shark42 and silky shark43 population have be devastate by both longliner and purse seiner and not enough datum be available to assess other key shark species44 meanwhile wcpfc party continue to resist develop even the most basic shark management plan threaten albatross petrel and sea turtle continue to be kill as bestpractice bycatch mitigation measure be still not in place and again observer coverage and reporting requirement be not good enough to collect accurate datum on these specie wcpfc must address urgent datum and compliance issue the follow list encompass priority that must be address to ensure that further work by the sc and tcc and measure develop by wcpfc will not continue to be undermine greenpeace call on the commission to strengthen mandatory reporting requirement to ensure that fishing capacity and effort in all tuna billfish and shark fishery be adequately measure and report so as to allow for the good performance of the sc and a sound basis for conservation and management measures impose deterrent sanction for case of noncompliance to ensure that state comply with all their datum reporting requirement such as no data no fishing measure of the type recently agree at the indian ocean tuna commission iotc45 improve transparency and compliance by remove barrier to ngo and igo observer access to the compliance monitoring process and relevant document and meeting require a clearlydefine representative 20 observer coverage on longline fleet where human onboard observer be not feasible for certain fleet or vessel size other alternative such as electronic monitoring system must be assess and put in place subject to minimum technical requirement that ensure the reliability of the system these must not prevent the much needed increase in human observer coverage start with ensure that exist obligation be meet ensure the health and safety of all observer by develop robust safety and security measure and transparent reporting mechanism for infraction and action take against any operator or crew member that harass intimidate harm or in any way prevent observer from perform their duty improve and align vessel database and the information field they contain to ensure good datum availability for capacity assessment phase out all transhipment at sea in the interim all transhipment must have observer on board both the fishing and carrier vessel any violation detect in transhipment must result in the loss of transhipment authorisation consider fad in context of capacity management and prioritise the collection of datum on the number of fad and the associated technology use and abandon or lose by vessel in order to assess effort creep associate with fad use and their impact on juvenile tuna and shark population develop measure to improve the quality and quantity of datum record and report for all shark catch include mobula and manta ray include detail of the species gear type use and the condition of each animal on release dead injure alive this must include a requirement that all shark be land with their fin naturally attach failure to report on shark catch should result in a ban on use sharkspecific gear and on retention of shark

bluefin tuna PBF have the unfortunate distinction of being the worlds most depleted tuna population in history and the species now faces a serious threat of extinctioni Decades of overfishing have decimated the stock pushing it down to just 26 of its unfished levelii Despite the clear scientific evidence that the species is in a dire situation both domestic and international fisheries managers are failing to protect Pacific bluefin tuna We the undersigned 58 scientists call for a moratorium on commercial Pacific bluefin fishing until the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC and InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC improve their management of the species by ending overfishing and adopting a basinwide rebuilding plan with a sciencebased precautionary rebuilding target and deadline We join a growing number of experts who have recognized the serious situation that PBF is in due to a lack of effective management In June 2016 an independent performance review of IATTC stated By any measure this stock is in serious troublePacific Bluefin has been fished to a very low level and needs urgent joint WCPFC and IATTC management actioniii Fourteen organizations recently submitted a petition to the US government to list the Pacific bluefin tuna as endangered under the Endangered Species Act citing its severely overfished state continuing overfishing and the very real risk of extinction The US government has determined that listing may be warranted and is now conducting a full status review of the species In Japan a group of artisanal fishermen who target PBF have voluntarily suspended fishing during the summer spawning seasoniv Unfortunately other governments have not followed these leads WCPFC took no additional action at its 2015 meeting and IATTC took no additional action at its 2016 meetings despite the known crisis facing PBT Until very recently there was no international management of this highly migratory stock whose migrations of thousands of miles take it through the waters of many fishing nations In 2014 WCPFC adopted a rebuilding target of the historical median biomass However because the stock had been overfished for almost the entire period they defined as historical the target equates to just 64 of the unfished levelv This is well below the commonly recommended rebuilding target of 2040 of unfished levels and is utterly inadequate to return the population to healthy levelsvi As part of this insufficient rebuilding plan WCPFC adopted a 50 reduction in the catch limits for small PBF however loopholes in the measure allowed several countries to increase their catchvii Furthermore neither Commission has adopted target or limit reference points The lack of effective management measures means that high levels of fishing continue to put pressure on the severely depleted population with fishing rates up to three times higher than sustainable levelsviii Nearly 98 of Pacificwide catch is composed of juveniles that have not yet reproduced a blatant case of growth overfishingix At the other end of the lifecycle adults are targeted by an industrial purse seine fleet when they are aggregated on the spawning grounds an illadvised practice that reduces reproductive success by disturbing spawning and selectively removing large spawning adults leading to reduced maximum yield and loss of genetic diversityx Adding to the management failures there continues to be a lack of transparency in the scientific process that is out of step with standard practices in international fisheries science The first publically available stock assessment report was not released by the overseeing scientific body the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and TunaLike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC until 2012 The ISC still does not allow independent observers to attend or participate in their stock assessment meetings and non government scientists must be invited in order to attend where their participation is severely limited Meeting reports can take six months or longer to be approved and released to the public often delaying needed action As scientists who are concerned about the dire state of the Pacific bluefin population we urge PBF fishing nations to immediately implement a moratorium on commercial PBF fishing until appropriate sciencebased management measures and a basinwide rebuilding plan with an appropriately precautionary target are in place We also call for full transparency in the scientific process including opening ISC working group meetings to observers and making meeting documents publicly available in a timely fashion Decisive action is now critical Sincerely Octavio AburtoOropeza PhD Associate Professor of Marine Biology

management measures specifically the adoption of TRPs and HCRs for the key target species particularly from industry participants with Marine Stewardship Council MSC certification and many end market representatives WWF specifically notes the opportunity that the WCPFC has before it due to the change in the recent assessment to establish a precautionary TRP for bigeye tuna BET while it is in a good condition Therefore WWF encourages WCPFC14 to maintain momentum on implementation of HS elements and where necessary take steps to recover timelines under the workplan WWF recommends that the WCPFC Support and endorse further implementation of CMM 201406 on Establishing a Harvest Strategy for Key Tuna Species in the WCPO consistent with proposed timelines Endorse further HCR development

Many shark species in the WCPO remain subject to high levels of fishing mortality that current stock assessment trends suggest could be unsustainable1 Sharks play a critical role in the WCPO marine ecosystem as apex predators and indicators of ecosystem health2 WWF is concerned with shark conservation and sustainability in the WCPFC region as a whole and considers responsible management trade and consumption where shark mortality occurs in all fishing activities not just in circumstances where tuna fishing is occurring Therefore WCPFC must also recognise the needs of coastal States in the WCPFC region to manage their shark populations Although WWF supports the previous minor action taken by the WCPFC in CMM 201405 Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks3 WWF fully supports the efforts made previously by the ABNJ Common Oceans project and SC14 to develop a proposed comprehensive and integrated shark CMM EBWP064 By way of reference we again endorse the recommendations

Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs o Implement the recommendations for bycatch that were endorsed at Kobe III and adopt an annually updated report card system against these recommendations for all of the WCPFC fisheries o Require through data collected from observer programs and other means estimation of the number of captures and releases of all sharks and rays including the status upon release dead or alive and reporting of this information to the WCPFC and o Require through observer programs recording what gear is used in longline activities including the use of wire traces and any multi monofilament traces in order to avoid biteoff by sharks Designate manta and mobula rays silky shark oceanic whitetip shark and whale shark as Species of Special Interest and reconciles observer data collection requirements for mobulid rays within the existing framework Adopt the riskbased method for shark stock assessment presented by the ABNJ Common Oceans project Consider a nonretention CMM for bigeye thresher shark Alopias Superciliosus within the WCPO Encourage the development of reference points and management for nontarget species including all shark and ray species as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Encourage CCMs that are Parties to the CMS to develop conservation and management measures in line to meet international obligations and Encourage CCMs to report all shark and ray catches from domestic fleets operating in territorial and archipelagic waters Sea Turtles Sea turtles are some of the most endangered species interacting with tuna fisheries with six out of seven species of sea turtles considered threatened with extinction according to the IUCN Red List WWF is very encouraged that the WCPFC indicates renewed interest in addressing the effectiveness of CMM 200803 for the Conservation and Management of Sea Turtles In particular we acknowledge the outcomes of the first workshop on Joint Analysis of Sea Turtle Mitigation Effectiveness in Longline Fisheries held in Honolulu Hawaii USA from 1619 February 2016 and support the proposed sea turtle analysis initiative WWF also welcomes the assessment of the Common Oceans ABNJ Project for their assessment of effectiveness of current sea turtle mitigation measures in the WCPO It is clear there remains no new evidence that CMM 200803 has demonstrably reduced bycatch impacts on threatened and endangered sea turtles in the region with an estimation of only 1 of WCPO longline effort currently subject to mitigation and thus WWF maintains that this CMM must be revised immediately with interim measures We note with interest the commentary in the WCPFCSPC report following the Hawaii workshop that most of the evidence suggests that circle hooks particularly those which have large minimum widths and are large relative to mouth size of susceptible sea turtles can reduce hooking interactions or mortality or both Use of finfish bait rather than squid bait is also a promising

WCPFC14-2017-OP03,9.0,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 14th Regular Session Manila Philippines 17 December 2017 WCPFC14 Accordingly WWF proposes a revisionreplacement of CMM 200803 in order to 1 ensure requirements for the determination of optimal bycatch mitigation packages ie circle hooks andor other measures such as finfish bait are undertaken for individual fisheries 2 reduce the ambiguity in language and 3 improve the definition of the desired outcomes of the CMM Moreover evidence suggests that the WCPFC and member states have not suitably monitored the CMM for effectiveness with some parts of the CMM distinguished as providing excessive room for creative compliance6 The majority of CCMs either have not fully reported on compliance with CMM 200803 or have not met all the CMM measures Furthermore only a small fraction of member countries have conducted dedicated research on sea turtle mitigation techniques and current observer coverage falls well below the recommended level for effectively determining optimal mitigation approaches ie 10 coverage over 3 years WWF thus urges WCPFC to support the revisionreplacement of CMM 20083 to include stronger and clearer requirements for adoption of mitigation measures and their specifications We also note the lack of inclusion in the scientific data standards of any data related to sea turtle encounters despite the scope of CMM 20157 includes reportingwith respect to implementation of measures for nontarget species and given the major gaps in annual reporting against CMM 20083 We suggest that such information should be specifically included in assessment criteria and in data standards including where appropriate data on sea turtle encounters including data on hook rates type and other factors comparative to hook type and bait WWF recommends the WCPFC Endorse revising or replacing CMM 200803 as outlined in WWFs Position Statement to the 12th Regular Session of the Commission7 including interim measures that would require members to determine optimum bycatch mitigation via usetesting of alternative hooks andor bait and to report on these results as well as reducing the technical vagueness in desired outcomes of the CMM Encourage member state involvement and participation in the research conducted under the analysis of sea turtle mitigation measure effectiveness in tuna longline fisheries

WCPFC14-2017-OP03,11.0,WWF Position flag and coastal state requirements at WCPFC13 However WWF continues to strongly believe that more needs to be done to fully address observer safety and security This need is underscored by two recent events Since WCPFC13 two observers have gone overboard at sea One observer James Numbaru will never come home Another observer was recovered after a search and rescue effort These incidents reinforce the need for further efforts to ensure observer safety and security through the full and transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents One of the outstanding gaps in observer safety and security is represented by the lack of information available to address observer incidents through proper followup and documentation A requirement for full reporting will allow for identification and understanding of potentially dangerous situations for future observers Until the WCPFC can fully understand the circumstances surrounding these incidents it cannot hope to properly address them The ROP Annual Report as it currently exists does not provide the necessary level of detail to properly address these issues Thus WWF recommends establishing a required comprehensive and transparent reporting procedure for observers and observer programmes to report instances of threats harrassment intimidation assault or death that national programmes and the ROP could then use to determine solutions to prevent future instances This procedure must include an annual publicly available consolidated detailed and fully transparent report of all infractions against observers Observer Coverage on Longline Vessels WWF notes that observer coverage on longline vessels operating in the WCPO regardless of the metrics used to calculate it remains substantially less than 5 regionwide Moreover WWF wishes to emphasise that the 5 observer coverage value identified by the WCPFC represents an arbitrary benchmark that was never intended to represent an end goal but rather a minimum starting point toward appropriate observer coverage Even a consistently applied level of 5 coverage is statistically and practically useless for most management or monitoring control and surveillance MCS purposes Therefore WWF supports efforts to improve the observer coverage of all longline fisheries in the WCPO As such WWF supports calculating observer coverage according to the proposed hierarchy of four metrics for assessing observer coverage but notes that best practice would be to use number of hooks deployed as an appropriate metric If other metrics for calculating coverage are used terms must be very clearly defined in advance and each metric must be calculated in a way to be comparable to the other metrics WWF also notes that different levels of observer coverage may be required for management or compliance purposes depending on specific identified objectives and recommends that appropriate analyses be conducted to determine each of those levels respectively in the context of identified objectives Most importantly the WCPFC must ensure that the ROP and national observer programmes receive full funding and support to ensure their continued operation and that the level of observer coverage on longline vessels be increased immediately to achieve management and compliance objectives Transhipment Monitoring Transhipment remains one of the most prominent weaknesses in catch documentation and verification that leads to Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU catch in the WCPO WWF notes that the most simple efficient and effective solution to the challenges of transhipmentrelated IUU is to simply prohibit all atsea transhipment and require all fishing vessels to land their catch at the nearest available designated port in the WCPO following the conclusion of fishing activity However acknowledging that a prohibition on transhipment is politically unlikely at this point WWF supports an unequivocal 100 observer monitoring requirement for all transhipments in all WCPFC CA waters subject to strong sanctions for nonreporting and noncompliance WWF also recommends that transhipment requirements be buttressed by verification and validation of transhipment activities through redundant systems including a vessel monitoring system VMS supplemented by an operating automated identification system AIS If through

by AIS it is determined that transhipment activity was conducted in violation of transhipment rules the offending vessels should be subject to sanctions including license revocation and listing on the

as well as supporting strong penalties and sanctions for violations Pacific Bluefin Tuna Technical reports of all scientific and management bodies responsible for management of the Pacific bluefin tuna stock including the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC and the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC indicate that the Pacific Bluefin tuna stock remains in extremely poor condition The ISC confirmed that overfishing continues even though the stock is heavily overfished and its spawning stock biomass has declined to as low as 26 of its unfished level 8 This is a clear indicator that the stock is no longer in the status to support industrial fisheries and the management measures taken both in the Western and Central Pacific and in the Eastern Pacific have proven insufficient to conserve the biological integrity of this stock in timely manner The IATTC and WCPFC must take immediate actions and assume their share of responsibility The latest assessment conducted by ISC confirms that the stock is highly depleted and that fishing mortality exceeds all reasonable proxies for Fmsy Without the robust and precautionary longterm rebuilding target the recovery of the stock may be further delayed if the current scenario of low recruitment continues which is heavily reliant on a major adult cohort in the population Therefore WWF urges both IATTC and WCPFC to adopt a longterm Pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan targeting at least 20SSB0 and harvest control rules that are welldefined preagreed and contain mandatory actions for a determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points In September both the Joint Meeting between Northern Committee NC of the WCPFC and IATTC as well as 13th Annual Meeting of the Northern Committee NC13 agreed a rebuilding target to achieve at least 20SSB0 by no later than 2034 with at least 60 probability including a tentative harvest strategy with associated harvest controls rules WWF recognises this agreement as an important turning point for rebuilding the Pacific bluefin tuna stock While the long term rebuilding target was agreed WWF remains concerned about increasing the catch limit before achieving the initial rebuiding target which was adopted at WCPFC12 WWF urges the WCPFC to consider that such harvest controls rules be based both on the best available scientific evidence and on the precautionary principle Furthermore reports indicate that the member states that catch

WCPFC14-2017-OP04,3.0,A brief from Nov 2017 Recommendations to the 14th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission7 December 2017 Manila Philippines Overview The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC has a mandate to sustainably manage and ensure longterm conservation of all highly migratory fish stocks including tunas and sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean However the Commissions handling of some stocks falls short of that mandate and global expectations of best practices despite a Convention that incorporates relatively modern principles of fisheries management The Conservation and Management Measures CMMs in place are inadequate to ensure that overfishing is ended or prevented Management of many stocks is reactive rather than proactive While some progress has been made on the conservation and management of sharks much more is needed to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of sharks is sustainable Masa UshiodaBlue Planet Archive Ensuring sustainable fisheries in the WCPFC Convention Area requires strong conservation and management actions strict compliance with measures already adopted and mechanisms that promote transparency and accountability The Pew Charitable Trusts urges all Commission members cooperating nonmembers and participating territoriesknown collectively as CCMsto cooperate and compromise in order to Agree on and adopt bridging measures for tropical tunas and south Pacific albacore that sustainably manage these tunas while transitioning to management by harvest strategies Adopt the rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin recommended by the Northern Committee and ensure compliance with measures Improve management of fish aggregating devices FADs Adopt electronic reporting and electronic monitoring standards for fishing vessels Prohibit retention of thresher sharks Prohibit retention of manta and mobula rays and adopt live release guidance for both Continue work to develop a comprehensive shark CMM Ban transshipment at sea until authorities can be certain that it does not contribute to illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing activity Improve the effectiveness and transparency of the compliance monitoring scheme Agree on and adopt a port State measures CMM to regulate minimum standards for port inspection of vessels believed to have engaged in IUU fishing or related activities in support of such fishing Urge eligible CCMs to implement the Flick the Switch measure adopted in 2012 which allows their national waters to be monitored by the Commissions Vessel Monitoring System VMS Amend Recommendation 201310 to require that all eligible fishing vessels obtain International Maritime Organization IMO numbers Establish a procedure that permits vessels found to be engaged in IUU fishing to be added to the IUU vessel list between annual meetings Recommendations Modernize management of tunas Fisheries management in the western and central Pacific must consider the importance of the stocks to the regions economies and the wellbeing of marine ecosystems by moving toward modern practices and developing more effective controls on purse seine and longline gears Tuna catches in these waters totaled an estimated 7 million metric tons in 2016the secondhighest amount on recordand represented 56 percent of the global catch1 Healthy stocks such as skipjackwhich accounted for 67 percent of the regions catchshould be managed with a longterm view Other stocks such as Pacific bluefin which is severely depleted and Pacific bigeye a stock of longstanding concern require urgent action that goes beyond business as usual Adopt bridging measures that sustainably manage the tropical tunas and south Pacific albacore while transitioning to the harvest strategy approach The Commission must move toward developing harvest strategies by agreeing on bridging measures for tropical tunas and south Pacific albacore The measures are supposed to serve as a bridge to implementation of harvest strategies as opposed to the ad hoc multiannual decisionmaking of years past that occurred largely in response to changes in stock status The 2017 stock assessment of bigeye which incorporated new growth data provides a more optimistic view of the stock than before It concludes that the stock is likely not experiencing overfishing and is at 032SBF0 with a 16 percent chance of being below the limit reference point The Commission should follow the advice of the Scientific Committee and not increase fishing mortality from current levels to maintain or increase the spawning biomass until members can agree on an appropriate target reference point for bigeye Wellcrafted harvest strategies offer considerable advantages to governments industry and the stocks They include clear objectives and harvest control rules HCRs that are tested for their performance in computer simulations Effective harvest strategies can ensure the sustainability and longterm profitability of resources vital to the wellbeing of the economies fishing industries and people of many nations They can offset natural variability scientific uncertainty and political influence while also allowing managers to act swiftly and efficiently without timeconsuming and costly negotiations To move toward this outcome the bridging measure for tropical tunas at a minimum must Incorporate decisions already made on harvest strategies including Limit reference points shall be 20 percent of the estimated average spawning biomass in the absence of fishing When developing HCRs in the future the Commission will determine the acceptability of HCRs in which the estimated risk of breaching limit reference points is between 0 and 20 percent Manage the skipjack purse seine fishery to achieve the interim target reference point of 50 percent of the estimated average spawning biomass of skipjack in the absence of fishing Manage bigeye to avoid increases in fishing mortality and increase the current spawning biomasswhich would decrease the probability that the stock is below the limit reference pointby Setting sciencebased longline catch limits that encompass all areas of the Convention Area where significant fishing is occurring Setting sciencebased FAD set limits in the purse seine fishery Link decisions on harvest strategies to the WCPFC harvest strategy workplan and prioritize agreement on a target reference point for bigeye given the concern for the stock and ensure timely development of a target reference point for yellowfin Support additional harvest strategy elements in the Commission workplan The Commission must build on last years progress to support efforts beyond the context of the bridging measures that are essential building blocks in developing harvest strategies for tunas Reflecting the importance of these stocks the Commission should adhere to the timelines in the workplan to Agree on a list of performance indicators even if only on an interim basis to model bigeye and yellowfin harvest control rules in the management strategy evaluation MSE Agree on actions necessary to conduct MSE as scheduled for skipjack to support MSE for all other tuna stocks with appropriate budgets and to ensure stakeholder outreach and capacity building to develop greater comfort with the harvest strategy approach Adopt a precautionary target reference point for south Pacific albacore Adopt the recommended rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin and ensure compliance with measures After years of stalemate the Northern Committee reached agreement on a recommended rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin at its meeting in August The plan aims to rebuild the population to at least 20 percent of its unfished levels by 2034 and includes commitments to develop reference points and harvest controls and to test them using MSE It also puts restrictions on how and when catch limits can be raised in the future ensuring that if the species is slow to recover management measures will be responsive to the state of the population This is a first step toward implementing a full harvest strategy for the severely depleted Pacific bluefin population which is at just 26 percent of its historic size but it is only the beginning of the needed efforts In the past two years both Japan and Korea have exceeded their catch limits for Pacific bluefin If the recovery plan is to reach its goals and return the species to healthy levels all members must commit to reducing future quotas to pay back these overages and to take all domestic actions needed to avoid exceeding these limits in the future In light of the outcomes of the Northern Committee meeting Pew recommends that the WCPFC Adopt the recommended rebuilding plan and CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna Note the recent catch limit overages and strongly urge all CCMs to implement the necessary domestic measures to prevent such overages in the future Direct all CCMs to comply with the reporting requirements in CMM 201604 Commit to continuing to include Pacific bluefin on the WCPFC annual meeting agenda so the Commission can monitor the Northern Committees progress in meeting rebuilding plan deadlines Effectively manage fish aggregating devices Bigeye tuna in the purse seine fishery are taken almost exclusively in sets on FADs while the use of FADs contributes to the catch of nontarget species such as some species of sharks and turtles as well as marine debris Improving FAD management should be an urgent priority The Commission neither limits the total allowable number of sets that can be made on FADs nor the number of FADs that can be deployed It also lacks basic data on how many FADs are deployed or their fates lost abandoned etc Given the significance of the FAD fishery the Commission should lead in FAD management It took a step forward when it created the FAD Working Group which held two meetings in 2016 but the group did not recommend FAD management options a key part of its terms of reference and did not meet in 2017 An independent Global FAD Science Symposium held in Santa Monica California in 2017 included experts familiar with the western and central Pacific Ocean They agreed on a series of best practices for managing FADs in a tropical tuna purse seine fishery2 The WCPFC Scientific Committee recommended that the Commission take into consideration the examples of best practices when developing a framework for management of FADs within the Convention Area Given the significance of FAD use the Commission should follow the scientific advice and take steps to improve the data collection and management of FADs including Agree to introduce a FAD buoy identification scheme as recommended by the Scientific Committee and the Technical and Compliance Committee and agree to develop a physical marking scheme for the raft components of FADs recognizing that FAD buoys are frequently swapped among rafts Adopt the changes recommended by the Scientific Committee to the data fields to be filled out by observers and vessel operators to ensure that data is collected from all vessels involved in FAD activities including support vessels That will allow the Commission to better understand the number of FADs deployed their fates and construction methods Agree to establish a clear process to improve FAD management noting the best practices agreed to during the independent FAD Science Symposium related to Agreeing to management objectives for FAD use Shifting some fishing effort to free school fishing through market such as certification schemes policy such as FAD set limits or other incentives which would have a positive impact for juvenile tunas and certain nontarget species Establishing a cap on the number of FADs to avoid cherrypicking and reduce marine pollution including beaching or grounding of FADs Using nonentangling FADs which result in little to no risk of entangling sharks and turtles without decreasing catches of tunas Adopt electronic reporting and electronic monitoring standards Commission policies currently do not require sufficient and timely submission of critical fishing data or mandate that their accuracy is confirmed which contributes to ineffective management of the tuna longline fisheries in the Convention Area In 2014 fish caught by longliners in the western and central Pacific had an end value of almost US4 billion3 Given the economic importance of that sector of the fishery the Commission should act to safeguard its longterm sustainability by instituting regulations to address data gaps so that timely and accurate tracking of longline fishing catch and effort can be ensured Promising new technologies can make required reporting and monitoring faster more accurate and more reliable Electronic reporting ER systems allow information on catches to be relayed in near realtime in a standardized format In addition proven electronic monitoring EM technology can be used to expand observer coverage requirementswithout additional onboard personnel Technological advances coupled with the increasing costeffectiveness of ER and EM systems can help improve fisheries management and ensure high levels of compliance with conservation and management measures Near realtime electronic catch reporting improves accountability and accuracy which benefits authorities vessel owners and scientists Many WCPFC member countries have already embraced these technologies as effective management tools for their domestic fisheries Pew calls on members of the WCPFC to Adopt the pending electronic observer reporting and transshipment declaration and notification standards and direct the ER and EM Working Group to oversee development of necessary EM standards Require 100 percent electronic reporting to improve timeliness and accuracy of catch reporting Require CMMs to report the level of observer coverage achieved for their carrier vessels as mandated by CMM 200906 Commit to requiring 100 percent observer coverage on longline vessels as now required on purse seine vessels by complementing onboard human observers with electronic monitoring once standards have been adopted Strengthen conservation and management of sharks An unsustainable number of sharksan estimated 63 million to 273 millionare caught and killed in commercial fisheries each year4 Whether this catch is highly sought after or unintended and unwanted managers must take immediate action to stop the decline in shark populations and mitigate the damage it causes to marine ecosystems Until measures are in place to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of sharks is sustainable harvest of these animals should be avoided Those caught should be released alive whenever possible Fishing gear that increases the likelihood of shark catch such as wire leaders and shark lines should be prohibited and research should be done to determine the best means of avoiding shark catch If CCMs are to continue to target sharks or to catch sharks as bycatch then the Commission must enact management measures that reflect the precautionary principle In instances where limited population data for shark species results in uncertain stock assessments managers must implement precautionary measures such as prohibitions or catch limits that can safeguard these vulnerable stocks The Commission should also require that fins be naturally attached when sharks are landed Adopting this global standard would allow for better enforcement of the WCPFC prohibition on shark finning Based on the advice of the WCPFC Scientific Committee Pew calls on the Commission to Prohibit the retention of thresher sharks Thresher sharks are among the most vulnerable of all shark families5 but have been subject to no management action in WCPFC fisheries A Pacificwide assessment presented at this years Scientific Committee meeting shows that fishing mortality is likely to be above sustainable levels particularly for bigeye threshers All three species of thresher shark were listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES in October 2016 meaning that all international trade or import of catch from international waters must be sustainable as of 4 October 2017 Management action is urgently needed both to implement that listing and to respond to the new WCPFC scientific advice Pew urges the Commission to Ban the retention of all thresher sharks while prioritizing data collection on ongoing bycatch levels and post release survival to inform future management strategies including sustainable catch limits Prohibit retention of manta and mobula rays and adopt live release guidance The family Mobulidae which includes manta rays and mobula rays is extremely vulnerable to overfishing Observer reports show that manta and mobula rays are often killed as bycatch in WCPFC purse seine fisheries 284 metric tons were recorded from 1994 to 20096 At its recent meeting the Scientific Committee adopted safe handling guidelines for these species that will facilitate live release Furthermore the Technical and Compliance Committee TCC recommended that the Commission adopt these safe release guidelines for manta rays and mobulids Pew urges the Commission to Ban the retention of manta and mobula rays and implement the Scientific Committees 2017 guidelines for safe release of such rays when caught incidentally in WCPFC fisheries Continue work to develop a comprehensive shark CMM At its 2016 meeting the Commission initiated work to develop an overarching shark CMM to help the WCPFC better manage both targeted shark fisheries and incidental bycatch This year the Scientific Council started work on development of this measure although additional effort is needed over the next year to refine it Pew applauds this initiative and encourages the WCPFC to continue efforts to develop a comprehensive shark CMM that would prioritize the following Banning wire leaders and shark lines in fisheries that are not declared as targeted shark fisheries to reduce the mortality of prohibited species Ensuring that all targeted shark fisheries are subject to management plans that limit mortality to sustainable levelsespecially for heavily exploited blue and mako sharks Expanding observer coverage for longline fleets operating in the Convention Area Adopting a no data no fish measure for sharks which would prohibit CCMs that do not submit landing data on key shark species from retaining shark catches Continue efforts to stop illegal fishing Ban transshipment at sea until authorities can be certain it does not contribute to IUU activity A lack of effective regulations and monitoring means that illegal unreported and misreported transshipment of catch at sea particularly within the longline sector contributes significantly to IUU activity in the Commission area Within the western and central Pacific alone an estimated 142 million a year of tuna and tunalike product is involved in illegal atsea transshipment activities7 The current WCPFC transshipment measure CMM 200906 includes several exemptions and loopholes that increase opportunities for IUU transshipment For example activities in archipelagic waters are exempted from reporting requirements meaning that transshipments that occur in hundreds of thousands of square kilometres within the Convention Area go unreported In addition activities in a countrys exclusive economic zone are governed by national legislation which can be weaker than WCFPC reporting requirements Finally despite the intention of CMM 200906 to strictly limit transshipment at sea more than 52 percent of nonpurse seine vessels currently on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels were allowed to transship on the high seas in 2016 up from 49 percent the previous year At the same time the WCPFC Convention says Commission members must encourage their fishing vessels to conduct transshipment in port to support efforts to ensure accurate reporting of catches8 However over the past six years both the number of transshipping events at sea and the number of fishing vessels involved in transshipping at sea have increased making these activities the norm rather than the exception In addition verification of reported transshipment activity remains difficult Although all carrier vessels are required to have 100 percent observer coverage the WCPFC Secretariat does not currently receive reports from these observers nor does it maintain a database for this information That means that observer reports of transshipments on the high seas cannot be compared or crossverified with information provided directly from the vessel The Secretariat also cannot audit these activities because vessels are not required to provide transshipping notifications and declarations to the Secretariat when transshipping occurs in port within EEZs or in archipelagic waters As such no single body including the Secretariat maintains a full and complete picture of this activity within the entire Convention Area from the point of catch to the point of offloading Additional controls are needed to ensure that transshipment activities are legal and verifiable Pew calls on members of the WCPFC to Ban transshipment at sea until authorities can be certain it does not contribute to IUU activity Direct the TCC to review the draft guidelines prepared by the Secretariat for determination of circumstances when it is impracticable for certain vessels to transship in port or in waters under national jurisdiction as required in CMM 200906 Establish formal observer reporting processes procedures submission requirements and standardized forms for observers on carrier vessels to ensure that every highseas transshipment reported via declarations can be cross validated by the Secretariat as to species quantity and location Improve transshipment reporting protocols to create a full and complete picture of this activity as it occurs regardless of location by requiring transshipment reports and declarations to be provided to the Secretariat wherever and whenever the activity takes place in the Convention Area Improve the effectiveness and transparency of the compliance monitoring scheme The Second Joint Meeting of Tuna RFMOs in 2009 recommended that the regional fisheries management organizations develop robust compliance review mechanisms so that the records of each member of the Commission could be examined on an annual basis As a result the WCPFC established a trial Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS to ensure that CCMs meet their obligations The CMS is designed to assess CCM compliance It also helps to identify areas where technical assistance or capacity building may be needed and determine aspects of CMMs that require refinement or amendment for effective implementation That CMS measure however continues to operate on a shortterm trial basis CCMs must make significant investments of time to assess CMM compliance each year and review and renew the measure itself Because the CMS is a critical component of the WCPFC compliance process CCMs should make it permanent and remove the need for an annual review In addition the CMS does not include tangible penalties for non compliance with Commission obligations and has been implemented in a manner that prohibits observers from being present for CMS reviews and discussions In advance of the report of an independent CMS audit to be released in 2018 the Commission should agree to the following principles to improve the CMS in ways that fully and transparently support its conservation and management objectives The CMS should be a permanent measure to ensure greater predictability and certainty That would allow the TCC to devote more time to reviewing issues of compliance rather than the CMS itself Penalties should be set for noncompliance to establish a more effective and efficient scheme with the proper level of deterrence Observers should be permitted in CMS discussions in accordance with the WCPFC Conventions language on transparency and the practices of other tuna RFMOs Such a step would be a recognition that transparency is critical to accountability and a fundamental principle of good practice in public resource management Enhance CCM transparency and accountability Adopt minimum standards for port inspections Port State measures PSMs are costeffective tools to monitor compliance with management arrangements and prevent illegal fish from entering the market PSM proposals have been considered by the Commission for several years and were recommended as part of the WCPFC Performance Review in 2013 Recent efforts to adopt a CMM on Port State Measures to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing have fallen short but circumstances have changed in recent years The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Port States Measures Agreement entered into force in 2016 with a number of WCPFC members now party to the agreement creating a strong basis to establish a regional scheme within the WCPFC Pew urges the Commission to Adopt a port State measures CMM as soon as possible to regulate minimum standards for port inspection of vessels believed to have engaged in IUU fishing or related activities in support of such fishing If there is no agreement at the annual meeting task a small working group to develop text on a port State measures CMM for consideration by the TCC in 2018 with formal adoption by the Commission next year Urge eligible CCMs to implement the WCPFC9 Flick the Switch measure Since its adoption in 2012 the WCPFC9 Flick the Switch measure has received wide support from member countries that belong to the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency FFA9 Implementing the measure meant that CCMs with coastal State waters in the Convention Area could have their own national waters monitored by the Commissions VMS However not all coastal State CCMs have flicked the switch Bringing in the remaining costal State CCMs including the remaining five FFA member countries10 would maximize the usefulness of the Commissions VMS as a tool to eliminate illegal fishing It would give authorities in all coastal State CMM countries the ability to monitor nonlicensed vessels on the WCPFC authorized vessel list if they operated in their national waters This type of effective monitoring would help close a major loophole for IUU fishing Pew urges the Commission to Encourage all coastal state CCMs especially the FFA members to adopt the WCPFC9 measure Flick the Switch to maximize the use of VMS and improve the transparency of fishing operations in the Convention Area Amend Recommendation 201310 to require that all eligible fishing vessels obtain IMO numbers Recommendation 201310 entered into force 1 January 2016 and required that all vessels of 100 gross tons gross registered tons or more obtain an IMO number Member states have made great progress in providing IMO numbers for most active eligible vessels although gaps remain Member states are encouraged to ensure that none of their vessels that are required to have IMO numbers are fishing without this identification IMO numbers should be clearly marked in all vessel records In August 2016 the IMO amended its guidance on eligibility criteria for IMO numbers Fishing vessels of non steel hull construction of 100 GT and above and all motorized inboard fishing vessels of less than 100 GT down to 12 metres in length overall that are authorized to operate outside waters under national jurisdiction are now eligible This means that more than 200011 additional vessels listed on the WCPFC record of vessels can now obtain an IMO number Accordingly the Secretariat is encouraged to amend Recommendation 201310 to include all eligible fishing vessels Pew urges the Commission to Amend Recommendation 201310 to require that all eligible fishing vessels obtain IMO numbers Enhance the effectiveness of the IUU vessel list Placing a vessel on WCPFCs IUU vessel list helps to highlight and ultimately deter unacceptable practices in the Convention Area However the lists effectiveness is diminished because vessels found to be engaged in IUU fishing can be added only once a year As a result these vessels operate unhindered until the Commission meets and CCMs put them on the list The WCPFC permits vessels to be removed from the IUU vessel list between annual meetings In the same spirit the Commission should permit the listing of IUU vessels intersessionally Pew calls on members of the WCPFC to Establish a procedure that permits the addition of vessels found to be engaged in IUU fishing to the IUU vessel list between annual meetings Endnotes Peter Williams et al Overview of Tuna Fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean Including Economic Conditions2016 paper

present at this year scientific committee meeting show that fishing mortality be likely to be above sustainable level particularly for bigeye thresher all three specie of thresher shark be list on the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cite in october 2016 mean that all international trade or import of catch from international water must be sustainable as of 4 october 2017 management action be urgently need both to implement that listing and to respond to the new wcpfc scientific advice pew urge the commission to ban the retention of all thresher shark while prioritize datum collection on ongoing bycatch level and post release survival to inform future management strategy include sustainable catch limit prohibit retention of manta and mobula ray and adopt live release guidance the family mobulidae which include manta ray and mobula ray be extremely vulnerable to overfishe observer report show that manta and mobula ray be often kill as bycatch in wcpfc purse seine fishery 284 metric ton be record from 1994 to 20096 at its recent meeting the scientific committee adopt safe handling guideline for these specie that will facilitate live release furthermore the technical and compliance committee tcc recommend that the commission adopt these safe release guideline for manta ray and mobulid pew urge the commission to ban the retention of manta and mobula ray and implement the scientific committees 2017 guideline for safe release of such ray when catch incidentally in wcpfc fishery continue work to develop a comprehensive shark cmm at its 2016 meeting the commission initiate work to develop an overarching shark cmm to help the wcpfc well manage both target shark fishery and incidental bycatch this year the scientific council start work on development of this measure although additional effort be need over the next year to refine it pew applaud this initiative and encourage the wcpfc to continue effort to develop a comprehensive shark cmm that would prioritize the follow ban wire leader and shark line in fishery that be not declare as target shark fishery to reduce the mortality of prohibit specie ensuring that all target shark fishery be subject to management plan that limit mortality to sustainable levelsespecially for heavily exploit blue and mako shark expand observer coverage for longline fleet operate in the convention area adopt a no datum no fish measure for shark which would prohibit ccm that do not submit landing datum on key shark specie from retain shark catch continue effort to stop illegal fishing ban transshipment at sea until authority can be certain it do not contribute to iuu activity a lack of effective regulation and monitoring mean that illegal unreported and misreported transshipment of catch at sea particularly within the longline sector contribute significantly to iuu activity in the commission area within the western and central pacific alone an estimate 142 million a year of tuna and tunalike product be involve in illegal atsea transshipment activities7 the current wcpfc transshipment measure cmm 200906 include several exemption and loophole that increase opportunity for iuu transshipment for example activity in archipelagic water be exempt from report requirement mean that transshipment that occur in hundred of thousand of square kilometre within the convention area go unreported in addition activity in a countrys exclusive economic zone be govern by national legislation which can be weak than wcfpc reporting requirement finally despite the intention of cmm 200906 to strictly limit transshipment at sea more than 52 percent of nonpurse seine vessel currently on the wcpfc record of fishing vessels be allow to transship on the high sea in 2016 up from 49 percent the previous year at the same time the wcpfc convention say commission member must encourage their fishing vessel to conduct transshipment in port to support effort to ensure accurate reporting of catches8 however over the past six year both the number of transship event at sea and the number of fishing vessel involve in transshipping at sea have increase make these activity the norm rather than the exception in addition verification of report transshipment activity remain difficult although all carrier vessel be require to have 100 percent observer coverage the wcpfc secretariat do not currently receive report from these observer nor do it maintain a database for this information that mean that observer report of transshipment on the high sea can not be compare or crossverifie with information provide directly from the vessel the secretariat also can not audit these activity because vessel be not require to provide transshipping notification and declaration to the secretariat when transship occur in port within eez or in archipelagic water as such no single body include the secretariat maintain a full and complete picture of this activity within the entire convention area from the point of catch to the point of offload additional control be need to ensure that transshipment activity be legal and verifiable pew call on member of the wcpfc to ban transshipment at sea until authority can be certain it do not contribute to iuu activity direct the tcc to review the draft guideline prepare by the secretariat for determination of circumstance when it be impracticable for certain vessel to transship in port or in water under national jurisdiction as require in cmm 200906 establish formal observer report process procedure submission requirement and standardized form for observer on carrier vessel to ensure that every highseas transshipment report via declaration can be cross validate by the secretariat as to species quantity and location improve transshipment report protocol to create a full and complete picture of this activity as it occur regardless of location by require transshipment report and declaration to be provide to the secretariat wherever and whenever the activity take place in the convention area improve the effectiveness and transparency of the compliance monitor scheme the second joint meeting of tuna rfmo in 2009 recommend that the regional fishery management organization develop robust compliance review mechanism so that the record of each member of the commission could be examine on an annual basis as a result the wcpfc establish a trial compliance monitoring scheme cms to ensure that ccms meet their obligation the cms be design to assess ccm compliance it also help to identify area where technical assistance or capacity building may be need and determine aspect of cmm that require refinement or amendment for effective implementation that cms measure however continue to operate on a shortterm trial basis ccm must make significant investment of time to assess cmm compliance each year and review and renew the measure itself because the cms be a critical component of the wcpfc compliance process ccms should make it permanent and remove the need for an annual review in addition the cms do not include tangible penalty for non compliance with commission obligation and have be implement in a manner that prohibit observer from be present for cms review and discussion in advance of the report of an independent cms audit to be release in 2018 the commission should agree to the follow principle to improve the cms in way that fully and transparently support its conservation and management objective the cms should be a permanent measure to ensure great predictability and certainty that would allow the tcc to devote more time to review issue of compliance rather than the cms itself penalty should be set for noncompliance to establish a more effective and efficient scheme with the proper level of deterrence observer should be permit in cms discussion in accordance with the wcpfc conventions language on transparency and the practice of other tuna rfmo such a step would be a recognition that transparency be critical to accountability and a fundamental principle of good practice in public resource management enhance ccm transparency and accountability adopt minimum standard for port inspection port state measure psm be costeffective tool to monitor compliance with management arrangement and prevent illegal fish from enter the market psm proposal have be consider by the commission for several year and be recommend as part of the wcpfc performance review in 2013 recent effort to adopt a cmm on port state measures to prevent deter and eliminate illegal unreported and unregulated fishing have fall short but circumstance have change in recent year the food and agriculture organization of the united nations port states measures agreement enter into force in 2016 with a number of wcpfc member now party to the agreement create a strong basis to establish a regional scheme within the wcpfc pew urge the commission to adopt a port state measure cmm as soon as possible to regulate minimum standard for port inspection of vessel believe to have engage in iuu fishing or related activity in support of such fishing if there be no agreement at the annual meeting task a small working group to develop text on a port state measure cmm for consideration by the tcc in 2018 with formal adoption by the commission next year urge eligible ccm to implement the wcpfc9 flick the switch measure since its adoption in 2012 the wcpfc9 flick the switch measure have receive wide support from member country that belong to the pacific islands forum fisheries agency ffa9 implement the measure mean that ccms with coastal state water in the convention area could have their own national water monitor by the commissions vms however not all coastal state ccms have flick the switch bring in the remain costal state ccms include the remain five ffa member countries10 would maximize the usefulness of the commissions vms as a tool to eliminate illegal fishing it would give authority in all coastal state cmm country the ability to monitor nonlicensed vessel on the wcpfc authorize vessel list if they operate in their national water this type of effective monitoring would help close a major loophole for iuu fishing pew urge the commission to encourage all coastal state ccm especially the ffa member to adopt the wcpfc9 measure flick the switch to maximize the use of vms and improve the transparency of fishing operation in the convention area amend recommendation 201310 to require that all eligible fishing vessel obtain imo number recommendation 201310 enter into force 1 january 2016 and require that all vessel of 100 gross ton gross register ton or more obtain an imo number member state have make great progress in provide imo number for most active eligible vessel although gap remain member state be encourage to ensure that none of their vessel that be require to have imo number be fish without this identification imo number should be clearly mark in all vessel record in august 2016 the imo amend its guidance on eligibility criterion for imo number fishing vessel of non steel hull construction of 100 gt and above and all motorize inboard fishing vessel of less than 100 gt down to 12 metre in length overall that be authorize to operate outside water under national jurisdiction be now eligible this mean that more than 200011 additional vessel list on the wcpfc record of vessel can now obtain an imo number accordingly the secretariat be encourage to amend recommendation 201310 to include all eligible fishing vessel pew urge the commission to amend recommendation 201310 to require that all eligible fishing vessel obtain imo number enhance the effectiveness of the iuu vessel list place a vessel on wcpfc iuu vessel list help to highlight and ultimately deter unacceptable practice in the convention area however the list effectiveness be diminish because vessel find to be engage in iuu fishing can be add only once a year as a result these vessel operate unhindered until the commission meet and ccms put they on the list the wcpfc permit vessel to be remove from the iuu vessel list between annual meeting in the same spirit the commission should permit the listing of iuu vessel intersessionally pew call on member of the wcpfc to establish a procedure that permit the addition of vessel find to

adequate confidentiality requirements but ensuring transparency and sharing of information at the appropriate level prohibit the use of supply and tender vessels taking into account their role in increasing dFAD efficiency and that dFAD effort in the fishery is already too high address the impacts of dFADs by agreeing together with the FAD ban season adopted through the bridging tropical tuna measures on a significant and precautionary reduction in the number of dFADs buoys and sets allowed These FAD management options should be such that they ensure with high probability that bigeye tuna mortality does not increase from current levels make the use of biodegradable and nonentangling FAD designs mandatory with clear definitions based on data available to the scientific committee ensure an assessment of the capacity of longline fisheries is conducted within the shortest time possible including assessing the role of transshipments in increasing effective capacity and effort and adopt measures to eliminate overcapacity where it exists Conservation of target and nontarget fish stocks While current stock assessments indicate a varying degree of probabilities that the main tuna and billfish species exploited by this Commission are not currently overfished or suffering overfishing there are strong reasons to be cautious including important uncertainties in the stock In 2016 there

blue sharks appear to have recovered from a period of overfishing oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks populations have been devastated by both longliners and purse seiners We do not have enough data to adequately assess other shark species but a new approach for assessing fishery impacts on data poor shark species has highlighted that current fishing pressure on bigeye thresher is

WCPFC14-2017-OP09,9.0,measures that result in a precautionary decrease of fishing mortality on bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks particularly juveniles adopt the rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin recommended by the Northern Committee NC as a minimum action and call on the NC to continue to review it and increase its ambition Given the status of the stock it should be a priority that any catches in excess of the quotas be paid back by those States responsible continue work to develop a comprehensive shark CMM so as to ensure that all targeted shark fisheries are subject to management plans that limit mortality to sustainable levels including measures to improve the quality and quantity of data recorded and reported for all sharks caught details of the gear types used and the condition of each animal on release dead injured alive and a requirement that all sharks are landed with their fins naturally attached prohibit retention of thresher sharks and manta and mobula rays banning both wire leaders and shark lines in fisheries that are not declared as targeted shark fisheries to reduce the mortality of prohibited species ensure that any failure to provide data on sharks results in a prohibition to retain shark catches Monitoring control and surveillance including transshipments The current measure requiring a 5 observer level for longline fleets has been in force for a decade so it is about time that the failure by many fleets to meet this threshold results in consequences There should be strict deterrent consequences for the lack of compliance by Members and Cooperating NonMembers and their vessels to ensure management objectives are met Transshipments at sea continue to provide an easy access point for illegal fishing vessels to unload their illegal catches into the supply chain away from coast guards and port authorities This can make it impossible to track a shipment of fish back to the vessel that caught it and to detect fraud In the worst situations transshipment enables slavery at sea as crews can be kept at sea for months or even years at a time without getting back to a port making it difficult if not impossible to report on or to escape from physical abuse poor working conditions violence and even murder on board fishing vessels Finally NGOs have consistently pointed out to the lack of transparency in the work of the WCPFC

Pacific albacore to allow MSE and other work to proceed as scheduled in 2019 Bycatch and Sharks S H A R K S R A Y S S E A T U R T L E S S E A B I R D S What are the issues At WCPFC 14 the Commission agreed to an intersessional working group to develop a comprehensive shark management measure that would combine the existing measures and introduce other scientifically proven mitigation measures We are pleased at the progress made throughout 2018 but we note key issues such as requiring sharks to be landed with their fins naturally attached remain under discussion The Scientific Committee also adopted the Safe Release Guidelines for Sharks and Rays This years Scientific Committee also considered research related to seabird and turtle bycatch best practices These species are highly vulnerable to the impact of fishing as they have long lives and low reproductive rates The Scientific Committee noted that the hook shielding devices are considered to be an effective mitigation measure and for it to be included in the conservation and management measure along with the extension of the measure to cover all waters south of 25 degrees South For turtles following a thorough review of all available data and literature the Scientific Committee noted that the current measure only applies to 1 of longline effort in the WCPO and that expanding the measure to require the use of mitigation measures in all longline fisheries would significantly reduce the impact on turtle populations Why are we concerned WCPFC as one of the most recent RFMO treaties has a clear mandate to manage shark fisheries together with mitigating the impact of tuna fisheries on shark populations To date there are no management arrangement for shark fisheries and the conservation and management measures for minimise shark bycatch do not reflect the scientific advice nor are they best practice In fact all of the WCPFC conservation and management measures for bycatch mitigation fall short of the scientific advice turtle mitigation measures only apply to a small proportion of the longline fishery and seabird mitigation measures need to be extended to 20 degrees South up from the 30 degrees South consistent with all other RFMOs WCPFC needs to adopt scientifically proven bycatch mitigation measures for all species For sharks there must be a requirement to land sharks with fins naturally attached For turtles circle hooks need to be used in all longline fisheries not just the shallow set fisheries as in the existing measure which account for less than 1 of the longline effort For seabirds the measure must apply to all longline fisheries south of 25 degrees South and the hook shielding devices should be included as a possible mitigation method ISSF Position Statement 2018 Page

along with the extension of the measure to cover all water south of 25 degree south for turtle follow a thorough review of all available datum and literature the scientific committee note that the current measure only apply to 1 of longline effort in the wcpo and that expand the measure to require the use of mitigation measure in all longline fishery would significantly reduce the impact on turtle population why be we concerned wcpfc as one of the most recent rfmo treaty have a clear mandate to manage shark fishery together with mitigate the impact of tuna fishery on shark population to date there be no management arrangement for shark fishery and the conservation and management measure for minimise shark bycatch do not reflect the scientific advice nor be they good practice in fact all of the wcpfc conservation and management measure for bycatch mitigation fall short of the scientific advice turtle mitigation measure only apply to a small proportion of the longline fishery and seabird mitigation measure need to be extend to 20 degree south up from the 30 degree south consistent with all other rfmo wcpfc need to adopt scientifically prove bycatch mitigation measure for all specie for shark there must be a requirement to land shark with fin naturally attach for turtle circle hook need to be use in all longline fishery not just the shallow set fishery as in the exist measure which account for less than 1 of the longline effort for seabird the measure must apply to all longline fishery south of 25 degree south and the hook shielding device should be include as a possible mitigation method issf position statement 2018 page 5 10,Governance
WCPFC15-2018-OP02,8.0,What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Adopt a comprehensive CMM for sharks as recommended by SC14 which includes i mandatory use of all scientifically proven shark mitigation measures by longline fishing vessels ii a requirement that sharks be landed with fins still naturally attached to enable effective monitoring of the measure and speciesspecific data collection and iii a requirement that when an observer or electronic monitoring is in use for nonretention andor unwanted sharks to be hauled alongside the vessel before being cut free in order to facilitate species identification 2 Adopt the SC14 recommended Shark Research Plan and future work plan and the safe release guidelines for sharks and rays as endorsed by the Technical and Compliance Committee 3 Amend CMM 200803 on turtle mitigation to have it apply to all longline fisheries and improve the minimum data observer data requirements for turtles 4 Amend CMM 201706 on seabird mitigation to include hook shielding devices on the list of possible mitigation measures and expand the application of the measure to all longline fisheries operating in areas south of 25 degrees South Monitoring Control and Surveillance O B S E R V E R C O V E R A G E A N D E L E C T R O N I C M O N I T O R I N G What are the issues Comprehensive observer coverage is a critical component of monitoring and management of fisheries For largescale purse seiners WCPFC implemented a 100 observer coverage requirement 20 degrees north and south of the equator Yet the requirement for longline fisheries is only a minimum of 5 The science committees for IATTC and ICCAT have recommended 20 longline observer coverage a level appropriate to provide reasonable estimates of bycatch for most species for rare events even higher coverage rates may be necessary Recognising that electronic monitoring is not a replacement for onboard human observers this technology can be used where placement of human observers is not possible for example for certain fleets or vessel sizes including longliners Guidelines for using electronic monitoring including review rates by dry observers should be adopted ISSF is pleased to see continued progress on the electronic reporting standards during the intersessional period Why are we concerned Compliance data on observer coverage rates in longline fisheries shows some fleets continue to fail to meet the required minimum 5 observer coverage that was adopted in 2007 11 years ago Observer data is used for monitoring vessel compliance with management measures and is essential for independent verification of catch effort and interactions with associated species eg whale sharks The paucity of data from longline fisheries hinders scientific assessment and recommendations regarding effective conservation and management measures In addition WCPFC needs to agree to amendments to the minimum data fields for the Regional Observer Program and address ongoing concerns about the timeliness of observer reports being provided to relevant CCMs Furthermore WPCFC needs to address conduct issues to ensure a safe working environment so observers can continue to provide rigorous independent data to the Commission ISSF Position Statement 2018 Page 6 10 What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Strengthen CCM compliance with the existing minimum 5 observer coverage requirement particularly for fleets operating on the high seas by identifying and sanctioning noncompliance through the WCPFC Compliance Monitoring Scheme 2 Increase the level of longline human observer coverage to a minimum of 20 a level recommended by the scientific committees of IATTC and ICCAT to provide reasonable estimates of bycatch and to improve overall monitoring of the fishery 3 Direct the WCPFC Electronic Reporting and Electronic Monitoring Working Group to convene in 2019 to finalize the development of the electronic monitoring and reporting standards for both longline and purse seine to enable electronic systems to be used to achieve 100 observer coverage in longline fisheries and support additional data collection in purse seine fisheries and 4 Adopt amendments to the minimum data fields and ensure the submission of timely observer reports T R A N S S H I P M E N T What are the issues The annual report presented to this years Technical and Compliance Committee TCC14 meeting demonstrates continued noncompliance by the ten CCMs that authorise their vessels primarily longline vessels to undertake atsea transshipment including on the high seas CCMs are failing to meet the reporting deadlines for the required reports contained in CMM 2009 including the advanced notifications and transshipment event reports Furthermore despite CCM selfassessment of compliance with their obligation to have 100 observer coverage of all transshipments the observer reports have largely not been submitted to the Secretariat as required ISSF recognizes that electronic monitoring systems and ereporting are being tested and developed and that the Commission will also be developing Electronic Reporting Standards for Transshipment which could potentially be used to address some of these concerns We also note the progress of the Transshipment Analysis Tool that is helping to match reported transshipment with VMS records Why are we concerned Under the WCPF Convention atsea transshipment was supposed to be the exception not the rule However the ten CCMs that authorise atsea transshipment are in actual practice applying the exception to authorize 3997 vessels and failing to fully comply with WCPFC transshipment rules As high sea transshipment has been linked to IUU fishing activities labor abuses and other illicit activities ISSF remains very concerned at the ongoing noncompliance with the provisions of CMM 200906 What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do Undertake a thorough review of the transshipment measure CMM 200906 as recommended by TCC14 as a matter of priority in 2019 to address these significant gaps in its effectiveness which affect traceability of the products and could result in IUU fishing 1 Adopt amendments to CMM 200906 that include i Implementing real time or near realtime reporting for all components of transshipments particularly with the advent of electronic reporting systems ii Requiring that transshipment be reporting throughout the Convention area including atsea transshipment conducted inside EEZs iii Extending the transshipment management arrangements to bunkering vessels ISSF Position Statement 2018 Page 7 10 iv Automatically including any transshipment breaches on the draft IUU vessel list and v Replacing the clauses regarding the impracticability test and unfettered flag State authorization with clear criteria and a process for the Commission to review issued flag State authorizations against those criteria to ensure compliance 2 Adopt the EReporting Standards for Transshipment declarations and transshipment notices T R A N S P A R E N C Y I N C A T C H O R E F F O R T L I M I T S What are the issues WCPFC has adopted catch or effort limits for bigeye yellowfin skipjack and albacore tunas However during a given year there is no transparent mechanism for Member reporting when the total andor allocated catch or effort limits are being approached and if Members are within the prescribed limits This mechanism would allow RFMO CCMs and markets to make necessary conservation decisions during a given year if quotas are being achieved more quickly than anticipated Such a mechanism will also strengthen compliance monitoring and will be important for the implementation of future harvest strategies through catch or effort controls In addition scientifically designed projections useful for predicting when an overall limit could be achieved may be able to be developed by using historical patterns informed by inseason data Why are we concerned A lack of monitoring how Members are approaching or possibly exceeding annual individual catch or effort limits for particular tuna stocks or a total allowable catch or total allowable effort for a specific tuna stocks prevents rapid and precautionary conservation management and purchasing decisions within a given year It also undermines rapid detection of non compliance with catch or effort controls What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Require CCMs to report their inseason catch or effort status with respect to their Individual catch or effort limits andor annual TACs or TAEs where specified and 2 If an inseason reporting requirement is adopted request the Scientific Committee to develop quality assurance mechanisms for verification of inseason reports including through the use of electronic reporting technologies to minimize the risk of misreporting Compliance C O M P L I A N C E P R O C E S S E S What are the issues A strong compliance process improves fisheries management but in contrast to the other four tuna RFMOs the WCPFC Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS working group is closed to accredited observers The WCPFC has also not adopted a scheme of responses to noncompliance Further Members reports of the implementation of WCPFC measures known as Part II reports remain confidential and the responses of Members to identified noncompliance are not released publicly ISSF Position Statement 2018 Page 8 10 ISSF read with interest the 2018 Report of the Independent Panel Review of the Commissions Compliance Monitoring Scheme and was pleased to participate in the Intersessional Working Group on the CMS this year that was tasked with the development of a revised CMS CMM The leadership of the IWG Chair supported by the Secretariat has made progress on the new scheme but there are many issues that remain We call on all members to recall the significant progress on key issues such as the provision of operational level data that was only made possible by shining a light on some members non compliance through the CMS We will continue to work to provide creative input to address the remaining issues with the aim of implementing a strong equitable and effective CMS that seeks to improve the overall compliance by CCMs with their obligations Why are we concerned The CMS working group comprised of CCMs reviews and assesses Members implementation of critical WCFPC conservation measures and determines if there has been a compliance breach This group considers if measures are unclear or if other factors are causing gaps in full implementation by CCMs CCMs assessing their own compliance behind closed doors is not consistent with best practice Transparency in this process through the participation of accredited observers is essential for this work to be considered robust fair and trustworthy If compliance discussions take place behind closed doors with no openness or checks on accountability the public and the market may question the sustainability and effectiveness of the regions fisheries management What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Adopt a durable compliance monitoring measure and reform its CMS process so that accredited observers may attend the working group meetings and information on CCMs plans to address the areas of identified noncompliance be made public 2 Review the elements of the Part II report and make public all elements that can be ie only limit the information which is truly nonpublic such as VMS data to provide clear information on how CCMs have given effect to the adopted conservation and management measures and 3 Develop a scheme of responses for example increased

of fishing capacity in WCPFC Fishing fleet overcapacity increases pressure to weaken management measures and eventually it leads to stock overexploitation What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Establish limited entry through closed vessel registries and develop a common currency to measure fishing capacity such as cubic meters of well volume ISSF Position Statement 2018 Page 9 10 2 To impose and enforce as a precautionary measure measures to limit longliner capacity in the Convention Area and task the SC to make recommendations regarding the levels of longline capacity consistent with

WCPFC15-2018-OP04,2.0,COMMISSION FIFTEENTH REGULAR SESSION Honolulu Hawaii USA 14 December 2018 POSITION STATEMENT TO WCPFC15 WCPFC152018OP04 November 2018,commission fifteenth regular session honolulu hawaii usa 14 december 2018 position statement to wcpfc15 wcpfc152018op04 november 2018,Residual
WCPFC15-2018-OP04,4.0,WCPFC Must Commit to Science Based Management LongTerm Sustainabilityth annual meeting 1014 December 2018 Honolulu Hawaii US A brief from Nov 2018 Overview The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC is responsible for the effective longterm conservation management of highly migratory fish stocks including tunas and sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean The Pew Charitable Trusts calls on members cooperating members and nonmembers to take the following critical actions at the 15th annual meeting of the Commission from 914 December 2018 in Honolulu Hawaii US1 Agree on steps to further develop harvest strategies Although some progress has been made in developing elements of harvest strategies for different tuna species the WCPFC must continue to follow its workplan The next step would be to agree on a precautionary target reference point TRP for South Pacific albacore even if only on an interim basis In addition the Commission should clarify management objectives for bigeye and yellowfin as it prepares to adopt TRPs for those stocks next year In doing so members must specify that the acceptable risk of breaching the limit reference point LRP should be 5 percent or less in keeping with the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement Steve TrainoffGetty Images Finally the WCPFC should create a harvest strategy development working group as recommended by the Scientific Committee SC to improve the dialogue among scientists and managers on the elements of harvest strategies2 The working group should be empowered to hold informal sessions to facilitate open dialogue and capacity building as well as formal sessions to make recommendations directly to the Commission Reduce the impacts of fish aggregating devices FADs The WCPFC should seize an opportunity to improve the management of FADs in Pacific waters The Commission should adopt the minimum guidelines on nonentangling FADs developed by the FAD Working Groupbut require that they be followed3 That would bring the WCPFC to the standard set by other tuna regional fisheries management organizations RFMOs In addition the WCPFC should reduce the limit on the number of FADs that vessels can have in the water at one time work to reduce plastic in FADs and task the working group with recommending strategies for better control and retrieval of FADs These steps would align with the advice of the SC Research presented to the committee this year found that at least 26 percent of deployed FADs could be considered lost while at least 5 percent wash up on shores or reefs4 In addition ocean areas with greater densities of FADs may experience reduced catch per unit of effort for tunas indicating potential fragmentation of schools5 Fish aggregating devices and the material to make them are seen on board a purse seine vessel The Pew Charitable Trusts Ensure that bigeye tuna are managed for longterm sustainability The tropical tuna bridging measure Conservation and Management Measure CMM 201701 specifies that the spawning biomass of bigeye tuna be maintained at or above the average of the ratio between current biomass levels and the levels that would exist in the absence of fishing for adult fish SBSBF0 for 201215 pending agreement on a future TRP for the stock6 This year the WCPFC will reexamine key provisions of that measure including the length of the FAD closure and the longline catch limit scheme for bigeye The Commission must maintain that spawning biomass ensure a very low probability of breaching the LRP and minimize the probability that overfishing could occur Further in the purse seine fishery the WCPFC should replace the FAD closure period with sciencebased limits on FAD sets which would provide greater control over juvenile and smallbigeye mortality Adopt an effective and transparent compliance monitoring scheme CMS Achieving sustainable fisheries requires a robust compliance scheme With the existing CMS set to expire in the WCPFC must adopt a new one to ensure that it can assess Commission members compliance with WCPFC obligations The CMS should support Commission objectives fully and transparently To that end Pew urges that the new scheme require that flag States provide information on allegations of noncompliance with Commission measures the actions taken by States in response and the final disposition The system should include a protocol for the Technical and Compliance Committee TCC to review investigations and responses Pew also urges that observers be permitted in compliance discussions among member States as allowed by the WCPFC Convention In addition the Commission should commit to developing agreeing on and implementing penalties for serious andor persistent noncompliance Reform transshipment at sea Transshipment at sea continues to provide opportunities for misreporting and laundering illegal unreported and unregulated IUU catch Pew calls for a ban on transshipment at sea in the Convention area until best practices are implemented to increase transparency and ensure a strong legal and verifiable seafood supply chain This year the TCC recommended that the Commission review the existing transshipment measure CMM 2009 as a priority item in 20197 Pew urges the Commission to establish an intersessional working group to guide this effort before next years TCC meeting The revised measure should include the following best practices Put in place consistent nearrealtime transshipment reporting requirements for all vessels and areas within the Convention area including all transfers of catch that occur in port or within national exclusive economic zones Require that transshipment authorizations and declarations be sent to all relevant authorities including the secretariat and that carrier vessels notify the secretariat of their intent to transship WCPFCmanaged species when entering the Convention area Require all vessels involved in transshipment activities to carry observers who provide independent observer reports directly to the secretariat In addition WCPFC should Develop strict guidelines to limit the number of vessels that can transship under the impracticable exemption Establish or strengthen formal transshipping datasharing agreements with neighboring RFMOs and the companies that provide onboard observers to their vessels Increase longline observer coverage and electronic monitoring EM Technological advances coupled with more costeffective EM systems can help improve fisheries management and ensure high levels of compliance with CMMs Many WCPFC member States have embraced these technologies as effective management tools for their domestic fisheries Pew calls on Commission members to support the work of the ERandEM Working Group in developing EM standards The Commission also should commit to requiring 100 percent observer coverage on longline vesselsas now required on purse seine vesselsby complementing onboard human observers with EM once standards have been adopted The Pew Charitable Trusts Tuna caught by purse seine vessels being transshipped in Pohnpei Micronesia IMO numbers make vessels easier to positively identify The unique sevendigit number issued to each vessel preceded by the letters IMO stays with a vessel until it is scrapped regardless of ownership country of registration or name The Pew Charitable Trusts Extend the International Maritime Organization IMO number requirement Member States have made great progress in providing IMO numbers for most active eligible vessels although gaps remain Member States should ensure that no vessels required to have IMO numbers are fishing without them IMO numbers should be clearly included in all vessel records In addition Pew urges the Commission to extend the requirement for IMO numbers to include motorized inboard fishing vessels of less than 100 gross tonnes down to those at least 12 meters in length overall The requirement should apply to all vessels authorized to fish in the Convention area beyond national jurisdiction in accordance with the recommendation made by the th regular session of the TCC Enhance the IUU fishing vessel list Today those found to be engaged in IUU fishing can be added to the IUU vessel list only once a year That means these vessels can operate unhindered until the Commission meets and action is taken to list them The WCPFC permits vessels to be removed from the IUU vessel list between annual meetings and should also permit adding to the list intersessionally Implement port State measures At its last meeting the WCPFC boosted efforts to fight IUU fishing with the adoption of minimum standards for port State measures PSMs a costeffective approach to preventing illegally caught fish from entering the market Implementation of CMM 201702 which spelled out those processes and procedures is now key8 In the runup to the Commission meeting every port CCM should designate a port or ports for inspection by port authorities of vessels suspected of engaging in IUU fishing or fishingrelated activities and identify the national contact point for PSMs Pew encourages the Commission through the 12th Finance and Administration Committee to define the funding mechanism to support small island developing States and participating territories in applying PSMs and to ensure that capacity assistance is streamlined with other initiatives within the region and globally Strengthen conservation and management of sharks The WCPFC must make reducing shark mortality an urgent priority Until measures are in place to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of sharks is sustainable harvest of these species should be avoided Management measures such as prohibitions or catch limits should reflect the precautionary principle especially when limited population data results in uncertain stock assessments Fishing gear that increases the likelihood of shark catch such as wire leaders and shark lines should be prohibited The Commission also should require that fins be naturally attached when sharks are landed A Pacificwide assessment for the bigeye thresher shark shows that management action is needed for this vulnerable species Prohibiting retention of these sharks also would help member States meet their requirements for the Appendix II listing on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Pew welcomes the work undertaken to develop an overarching shark CMM to help the WCPFC better manage both targeted shark fisheries and incidental catch and hopes that it can be concluded this year Conclusion Although the WCPFC has made some progress towards sciencebased management of some tuna fisheries and in the fight against IUU fishing more needs to be done to ensure the health of the tunas and sharks under its purview By implementing these recommendations the Commission and would take important

management longterm sustainabilityth annual meeting 1014 december 2018 honolulu hawaii us a brief from nov 2018 overview the western and central pacific fisheries commission wcpfc be responsible for the effective longterm conservation management of highly migratory fish stock include tuna and shark in the western and central pacific ocean the pew charitable trusts call on member cooperate member and nonmember to take the follow critical action at the 15th annual meeting of the commission from 914 december 2018 in honolulu hawaii us1 agree on step to far develop harvest strategy although some progress have be make in develop element of harvest strategy for different tuna specie the wcpfc must continue to follow its workplan the next step would be to agree on a precautionary target reference point trp for south pacific albacore even if only on an interim basis in addition the commission should clarify management objective for bigeye and yellowfin as it prepare to adopt trp for those stock next year in do so member must specify that the acceptable risk of breach the limit reference point lrp should be 5 percent or less in keep with the united nations fish stock agreement steve trainoffgetty images finally the wcpfc should create a harvest strategy development work group as recommend by the scientific committee sc to improve the dialogue among scientist and manager on the element of harvest strategies2 the work group should be empower to hold informal session to facilitate open dialogue and capacity building as well as formal session to make recommendation directly to the commission reduce the impact of fish aggregate device fad the wcpfc should seize an opportunity to improve the management of fad in pacific water the commission should adopt the minimum guideline on nonentangle fad develop by the fad working groupbut require that they be followed3 that would bring the wcpfc to the standard set by other tuna regional fishery management organization rfmo in addition the wcpfc should reduce the limit on the number of fad that vessel can have in the water at one time work to reduce plastic in fad and task the work group with recommend strategy for well control and retrieval of fad these step would align with the advice of the sc research present to the committee this year find that at least 26 percent of deploy fad could be consider lose while at least 5 percent wash up on shore or reefs4 in addition ocean area with great density of fad may experience reduce catch per unit of effort for tuna indicate potential fragmentation of schools5 fish aggregate device and the material to make they be see on board a purse seine vessel the pew charitable trusts ensure that bigeye tuna be manage for longterm sustainability the tropical tuna bridging measure conservation and management measure cmm 201701 specifie that the spawn biomass of bigeye tuna be maintain at or above the average of the ratio between current biomass level and the level that would exist in the absence of fishing for adult fish sbsbf0 for 201215 pende agreement on a future trp for the stock6 this year the wcpfc will reexamine key provision of that measure include the length of the fad closure and the longline catch limit scheme for bigeye the commission must maintain that spawn biomass ensure a very low probability of breach the lrp and minimize the probability that overfishing could occur far in the purse seine fishery the wcpfc should replace the fad closure period with sciencebase limit on fad set which would provide great control over juvenile and smallbigeye mortality adopt an effective and transparent compliance monitoring scheme cms achieve sustainable fishery require a robust compliance scheme with the exist cms set to expire in the wcpfc must adopt a new one to ensure that it can assess commission member compliance with wcpfc obligation the cms should support commission objective fully and transparently to that end pew urge that the new scheme require that flag state provide information on allegation of noncompliance with commission measure the action take by states in response and the final disposition the system should include a protocol for the technical and compliance committee tcc to review investigation and response pew also urge that observer be permit in compliance discussion among member states as allow by the wcpfc convention in addition the commission should commit to develop agree on and implement penalty for serious andor persistent noncompliance reform transshipment at sea transshipment at sea continue to provide opportunity for misreporte and launder illegal unreported and unregulated iuu catch pew call for a ban on transshipment at sea in the convention area until good practice be implement to increase transparency and ensure a strong legal and verifiable seafood supply chain this year the tcc recommend that the commission review the exist transshipment measure cmm 2009 as a priority item in 20197 pew urge the commission to establish an intersessional working group to guide this effort before next year tcc meet the revise measure should include the follow good practice put in place consistent nearrealtime transshipment reporting requirement for all vessel and area within the convention area include all transfer of catch that occur in port or within national exclusive economic zone require that transshipment authorization and declaration be send to all relevant authority include the secretariat and that carrier vessel notify the secretariat of their intent to transship wcpfcmanage specie when enter the convention area require all vessel involve in transshipment activity to carry observer who provide independent observer report directly to the secretariat in addition wcpfc should develop strict guideline to limit the number of vessel that can transship under the impracticable exemption establish or strengthen formal transshipping datashare agreement with neighboring rfmo and the company that provide onboard observer to their vessel increase longline observer coverage and electronic monitoring em technological advance couple with more costeffective em system can help improve fishery management and ensure high level of compliance with cmm many wcpfc member states have embrace these technology as effective management tool for their domestic fishery pew call on commission member to support the work of the erandem working group in develop em standard the commission also should commit to require 100 percent observer coverage on longline vesselsas now require on purse seine vesselsby complementing onboard human observer with em once standard have be adopt the pew charitable trusts tuna catch by purse seine vessel be transship in pohnpei micronesia imo number make vessel easy to positively identify the unique sevendigit number issue to each vessel precede by the letter imo stay with a vessel until it be scrap regardless of ownership country of registration or name the pew charitable trusts extend the international maritime organization imo number requirement member states have make great progress in provide imo number for most active eligible vessel although gap remain member states should ensure that no vessel require to have imo number be fish without they imo number should be clearly include in all vessel record in addition pew urge the commission to extend the requirement for imo number to include motorize inboard fishing vessel of less than 100 gross tonne down to those at least 12 meter in length overall the requirement should apply to all vessel authorize to fish in the convention area beyond national jurisdiction in accordance with the recommendation make by the th regular session of the tcc enhance the iuu fishing vessel list today those find to be engage in iuu fishing can be add to the iuu vessel list only once a year that mean these vessel can operate unhindered until the commission meet and action be take to list they the wcpfc permit vessel to be remove from the iuu vessel list between annual meeting and should also permit add to the list intersessionally implement port state measure at its last meeting the wcpfc boost effort to fight iuu fish with the adoption of minimum standard for port state measure psm a costeffective approach to prevent illegally catch fish from enter the market implementation of cmm 201702 which spell out those process and procedure be now key8 in the runup to the commission meeting every port ccm should designate a port or port for inspection by port authority of vessel suspect of engage in iuu fishing or fishingrelate activity and identify the national contact point for psm pew encourage the commission through the 12th finance and administration committee to define the funding mechanism to support small island develop states and participate territory in apply psm and to ensure that capacity assistance be streamline with other initiative within the region and globally strengthen conservation and management of shark the wcpfc must make reduce shark mortality an urgent priority until measure be in place to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of shark be sustainable harvest of these specie should be avoid management measure such as prohibition or catch limit should reflect the precautionary principle especially when limited population datum result in uncertain stock assessment fishing gear that increase the likelihood of shark catch such as wire leader and shark line should be prohibit the commission also should require that fin be naturally attach when shark be land a pacificwide assessment for the bigeye thresher shark show that management action be need for this vulnerable specie prohibit retention of these shark also would help member states meet their requirement for the appendix ii list on the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora pew welcome the work undertake to develop an overarching shark cmm to help the wcpfc well manage both target shark fishery and incidental catch and hope that it can be conclude this year conclusion although the wcpfc have make some progress towards sciencebase management of some tuna fishery and in the fight against iuu fish more need to be do to ensure the health of the tuna and shark under its purview by implement

WCPFC15-2018-OP07,7.0,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 15th Regular Session Honolulu Hawaii United States 914 December 2018 WCPFC15 This year the WCPFC should clarify and confirm management objectives for bigeye BET and yellowfin YFT as it prepares to adopt TRPs for those stocks next year In doing so members must also specify that the acceptable risk of breaching the limit reference point LRP should be 5 per cent or less in keeping with the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement WWF also urges WCPFC15 to adopt riskbased methods for assessing nontarget shark species with a view to adopting and implementing reference points for associated species WWF again notes the importance of and strong support for these important management measures specifically the adoption of TRPs and HCRs for the key target species particularly from industry participants with Marine Stewardship Council MSC certification and many end markets Therefore WWF encourages WCPFC15 to maintain momentum on implementation of HS elements and where necessary take steps to recover timelines under the workplan WWF recommends that the WCPFC Support and endorse further implementation of CMM 201406 on Establishing a Harvest Strategy for Key Tuna Species in the WCPO consistent with proposed timelines Confirm that the acceptable risk of breaching an LRP is 5 per cent or less Establish a TRP for the South Pacific albacore SP ALB longline LL fishery Endorse further HCR development and implementation for the skipjack SKJ purse seine PS fishery Support further development of interim precautionary TRPs for BET and YFT and Support the continued development and implementation of LRPs and TRPs as a priority for proper management of all stocks including sharks Sharks and Rays Many shark species in the WCPO remain subject to high levels of fishing mortality that current stock assessment trends suggest could be unsustainable1 Sharks play a critical role in the WCPO marine ecosystem as apex predators and indicators of ecosystem health2 WWF is concerned with shark conservation and sustainability in the WCPFC region as a whole and considers responsible management trade and consumption where shark mortality occurs in all fishing activities not just in circumstances where tuna fishing is occurring Therefore WCPFC must also recognise the needs of coastal States in the WCPFC region to manage their shark populations The assessment for bigeye thresher shark indicates that management action is necessary for this vulnerable species Given the poor stock status and equivalent position to oceanic whitetip and silky sharks a retention prohibition of these sharks would be consistent with prior WCPFC action while also assisting member States in meeting their requirements under Appendix II of CITES Although WWF supports the continued efforts toward the development of a Comprehensive Shark CMM we believe that specific components should be maintained or strengthened to ensure that the measure is ultimately effective WWF again commends the previous efforts and recommendations made by the ABNJ Common Oceans project in support of a proposed comprehensive and integrated shark CMM3 WWF

Moreover evidence suggests that the WCPFC and member states have not suitably monitored the CMM for effectiveness with some parts of the CMM distinguished as providing excessive room for creative compliance4 The majority of CCMs either have not fully reported on compliance with CMM 200803 or have not met all the CMM measures Furthermore only a small fraction of member countries have conducted dedicated research on sea turtle mitigation techniques and current observer coverage falls well below the recommended level for effectively determining optimal mitigation approaches ie 10 coverage over 3 years Thus WWF again urges WCPFC to support the revision or replacement of CMM 200803 to include stronger and clearer requirements for adoption of mitigation measures and their specifications We also note the lack of inclusion in the scientific data standards of any data related to sea turtle encounters despite the scope of CMM 20157 includes reportingwith respect to implementation of measures for nontarget species and given the major gaps in annual reporting against CMM 2008 We suggest that such information should be specifically included in assessment criteria and in data standards including where appropriate data on sea turtle encounters including data on hook rates type and other factors comparative to hook type and bait WWF recommends the WCPFC Endorse revising or replacing CMM 200803 to include interim measures that would require members to determine optimum bycatch mitigation via usetesting of alternative hooks andor bait and to report on these results as well as reducing the technical vagueness in desired outcomes of the CMM Encourage member state involvement and participation in the research conducted under the analysis of sea turtle mitigation measure effectiveness in tuna longline fisheries and Support the inclusion of sea turtle data in monitoring scheme assessment criteria and related data standards Regional Observer Programme Information collected as part of an appropriate observer programme is critically important to the proper management of a fishery Data collected by observers plays a central role in informing fisheries scientists on everything ranging from stock assessments to nontarget species impacts Furthermore observers play an indispensable role in monitoring and enforcing very important CMMs in the WCPO Indeed observers represent the vanguard of fisheries management through the science and service that they provide Consequently observer safety and security as well as appropriate observer coverage must be considered a top priority and greater support must be provided to the relevant authority to see that the capacity of the WCPFC Regional Observer Programme ROP is strengthened Observer Safety and Security WWF commends the WCPFCs previous actions to address issues with observer safety and security through the adoption of the observer safety and security provisions as well as the flag and coastal state requirements However WWF continues to strongly believe that more needs to be done to fully address observer safety and security Specifically WWF maintains that there is a need for a full and transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents One of the outstanding gaps in observer safety and security is represented by the lack of information available to address observer incidents through proper followup and documentation A requirement for full and transparent reporting will allow for identification and understanding of potentially dangerous situations for future

WCPFC15-2018-OP07,12.0,WWF Position WCPFC can fully understand the circumstances surrounding these incidents it cannot hope to properly address them The ROP Annual Report as it currently exists does not provide the necessary level of detail to properly address these issues Thus WWF recommends establishing a required comprehensive and transparent reporting procedure for observers and observer programmes to report instances of threats harrassment intimidation assault or death that national programmes and the ROP could then use to determine solutions to prevent future instances This procedure must include an annual publicly available consolidated detailed and fully transparent report of all infractions against observers Observer Coverage on Longline Vessels WWF notes that observer coverage on longline vessels operating in the WCPO regardless of the metrics used to calculate it remains substantially less than 5 regionwide Moreover WWF wishes to emphasise that the 5 observer coverage value identified by the WCPFC represents an arbitrary benchmark that was never intended to represent an end goal but rather a minimum starting point toward appropriate observer coverage Even a consistently applied level of 5 coverage is statistically and practically useless for most management or monitoring control and surveillance MCS purposes Moreover after more than 10 years of the enactment of the requirement many CCMs still have not achieved the required 5 coverage Therefore WWF strongly supports efforts to improve the observer coverage of all longline fisheries in the WCPO Under the WCPFC Convention CCMs are obliged to use the best available scientific evidence5 However the WCPFC cannot develop the best available science if the underlying data is poor leading to the problem of garbage in garbage out As such while WWF supports calculating observer coverage according to the proposed hierarchy of four metrics for assessing observer coverage we note that best practice as defined by the scientific services provider would be to use number of hooks deployed which would also lead to the production of the best available science WWF also notes that different levels of observer coverage may be required for management or compliance purposes depending on specific identified objectives and recommends that appropriate analyses be conducted to determine each of those levels respectively in the context of identified objectives However peerreviewed research that constitutes the best available science indicates a minimum of 20 observer coverage is necessary to secure an appropriate level of statistical significance for stock assessment purposes6 As evidenced by some CCMs ability to achieve it 20 coverage is not only the best available science but is also a reasonable and achievable minimum level to aim for WWF also believes that Electronic Monitoring EM is an important tool to help CCMs meet their observer coverage obligations WWF appreciates and even shares some concerns with some CCMs regarding the equivalency of data collected by EM versus human observers and that those differences could further complicate how we assess the level of observer coverage However existing scientific assessment suggests that EM can currently produce many of the important ROP data fields for longline fisheries and that those fields that EM falls short on may be dealt with over time Thus where information collected by EM is potentially equivalent EM should be considered in the ROP coverage metrics with the understanding that analyses should be conducted to help standardise the approach WWF recommends the WCPFC Endorse further observer safety and security measures including fully transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents and persons involved and Endorse an analysis of levels of observer coverage required to achieve management or compliance purposes while ensuring that the metrics and methodologies used support development of appropriate comparative analyses that meet the needs of the Scientific Services Provider and any MCS objectives,wwf position wcpfc can fully understand the circumstance surround these incident it can not hope to properly address they the rop annual report as it currently exist do not provide the necessary level of detail to properly address these issue thus wwf recommend establish a require comprehensive and transparent reporting procedure for observer and observer programme to report instance of threat harrassment intimidation assault or death that national programme and the rop could then use to determine solution to prevent future instance this procedure must include an annual publicly available consolidate detailed and fully transparent report of all infraction against observer observer coverage on longline vessels wwf note that observer coverage on longline vessel operate in the wcpo regardless of the metric use to calculate it

effort to improve the observer coverage of all longline fishery in the wcpo under the wcpfc convention ccms be oblige to use the good available scientific evidence5 however the wcpfc can not develop the good available science if the underlying data be poor lead to the problem of garbage in garbage out as such while wwf support calculate observer coverage accord to the propose hierarchy of four

analysis be conduct to determine each of those level respectively in the context of identify objective however peerreviewe research that constitute the good available science indicate a minimum of 20 observer coverage be necessary to secure an appropriate level of statistical significance for stock assessment purposes6 as evidence by some ccm ability to achieve it 20 coverage be not only the good

WCPFC15-2018-OP07,13.0,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 15th Regular Session Honolulu Hawaii United States 914 December 2018 WCPFC15 Transhipment Monitoring Transhipment remains one of the most prominent weaknesses in catch documentation and verification that leads to Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU catch in the WCPO WWF notes that the most simple efficient and effective solution to the challenges of transhipmentrelated IUU is to simply prohibit all atsea transhipment and require all fishing vessels to either tranship or land their catch at the nearest available designated port in the WCPO following the conclusion of fishing activity However acknowledging that a prohibition on transhipment is politically unlikely at this time WWF supports the review and revision of CMM 200906 to address deficiencies in the current measure There are currently ten countries that permit their flag vessels to conduct atsea transhipment While atsea transhipment is permissible if a member country states that it is impractical to conduct transhipment in port ambiguity in CMM 200906 particularly requirements around proving impracticability have resulted in an increasing number of vessels conducting atsea transhipment on the high seas of western and central Pacific Ocean While it was intended to be an exception to in port delivery atsea transhipment has become the rule observer coverage of atsea transhipment on carrier vessels represents a critical monitoring feature of the atsea transhipment regulations in the WCPO Yet some CCMs are consistently non compliant with these regulations For instance the WCPFC Secretariat received only one carrier observer report for the 2045 high seas transhipments reported in the Convention area in 2016 and Along with failing to provide observer reports to WCPFC these CCMs are also not providing basic reporting requirements such as advance notification of the intention to tranship nor transhipment events themselves WWF also recommends that the WCPFC adopt realtime or near realtime electronic reporting requirements for transhipment notification These requirements should be buttressed by electronic verification and validation tools such as redundant AIS or VMS transponders and EM If through investigation suspected unreported transhipment activity is detected and corroborated by these additional tools and authorities determine that the transhipment activity was conducted in violation of transhipment rules the offending vessels should be subject to strong sanctions including listing on the draft IUU vessel blacklist The Technical and Compliance Committee TCC14 identified the review of the CMM 200906 transhipment requirements as a priority Therefore we strongly recommend the WCPFC undertake a thorough review of CMM 200906 in 2019 and adopt substantive improvements as recommended by TCC14 WWF recommends the WCPFC Implement real time or near realtime reporting requirements for all components of transhipments including electronic verification and validation tools Review and revise CMM 200906 including replacing the impracticability test and unfettered flag State authorization with clear criteria and a process for the WCPFC to review issued flag State authorizations against those criteria to ensure compliance and Consider automatically including any vessel that breaches transhipment

WCPFC15-2018-OP07,15.0,WWF Position the North Pacific Ocean ISC and the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC indicate that the Pacific Bluefin PBF tuna stock remains in extremely poor condition The ISC and Scientific Committee SC14 both note that the stock is both overfished relative to the potential biomassbased reference points evaluated SSBMED and 20SSBF0 as well as subject to overfishing relative to most of potential fishing intensitybased reference points evaluated7 Furthermore even though the spawning stock biomass is only at 33 of its unfished level some CCMs were unable to reduce pressure on the stock as recommended in 2017 leading to a catch increase of 11 from 2016 to 2017 SC14 notes that projections of spawning stock biomass are strongly influenced by the inclusion of a singular anomalous and relatively high but uncertain recruitment in 2016 Due to this strong uncertainty in stock projections the majority of CCMs recommended a precautionary approach to the management of Pacific Bluefin tuna especially in relation to the timing of increasing catch levels until the rebuilding of the stock to higher biomass levels is achieved Without the robust and precautionary longterm rebuilding target the recovery of the stock may be further delayed if the current scenario of low recruitment continues which is heavily reliant on a significantly uncertain recruitment cohort Furthermore reports indicate that the member states that catch Pacific bluefin tuna exceeded their catch limits in both 2016 and 2017 As demonstrated by this continued increase in catch despite calls for reductions some CCMs have proven incapable of acting responsibly to conserve the Pacific bluefin tuna resource Thus WWF strongly recommends the WCPFC strengthen its monitoring control and surveillance MCS and to establish a catch documentation scheme CDS by 2020 in accordance with the adopted workplan established at WCPFC14 as well as to improve member state compliance with the management measures including firm and tangible sanctions for noncompliance WWF reiterates its strong disappointment for the reservation made by Japan at NC14 As the most dominant fishing country of the PBF stock WWF strongly urges Japan to withdraw their reservation and demonstrate their strong commitment to lead the robust rebuilding plan of the PBF stock Therefore WWF continues to urge the WCPFC to adopt a longterm Pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan targeting at least 20SSB0 and harvest control rules that are welldefined preagreed and contain mandatory actions for a determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points through an ongoing MSE process WWF recommends that the WCPFC Recommend to not increase the catch limit for both juvenile and adult fish until achieving the rebuilding target Establish a Catch Documentation Scheme CDS for the thorough monitoring of Pacific bluefin tuna by 2020 and Ensure

of its unfished level some ccm be unable to reduce pressure on the stock as recommend in 2017 lead to a catch increase of 11 from 2016 to 2017 sc14 note that projection of spawn stock biomass be strongly influence by the inclusion of a singular anomalous and relatively high but uncertain recruitment in 2016 due to this strong uncertainty in stock projection the majority of ccms recommend a precautionary approach to the management of pacific bluefin tuna especially in relation to the timing of increase catch level until the rebuilding of the stock to high biomass level be achieve without

trawlling for highly migratory species especialy Albacore tuna as the Pacific Ocean has a Troll fishery and therefor would be again infringing on our bennifits and rights to freedom of the sea We also ask for total transparency of the TCC relating to the taking of Albacore in the Pacific whethere it be compliant or non compliant as we are fishers and are efected dirrectly We should be allowed freedom of information to all that pertains to us fisherpersons Distingwished members of the WCPFC The Pacific Albacore Troll Fishery is a frail and fragile fishery that relies on healthy albacore stocks far greater than the scope of science or best avalabel science without the consideration of the fishery itself Science can not explain why a spacific species of tuna such as the Albacore can be harvested by trolling and be productive like no other Nor can science explain the changing of the nature of the species after it has been targetted by driftnets Tuna that have been introduced to driftnets tend to stop feeding on the surface and therfore uncatchable by trolling It only takes 12 years of driftnet fishing to deminish a whole fleet of trolling vessels This has been proven before in the 1980s and is apon us now Driftnets have been harvesting Albacore in the WCPFA for the past 15 years Albacore trollers have stopped beeing productive for the same amount of time Our livelyhoods depend on this commission to enforce the law with 0 tollerance We ask that high sanctions and or tarrifs be put on the countries that are repeat offenders using IUU driftnets OFAD Pacific Albacore Trollers would like to request that the commission make a rulling that forbids any pole and line vessel Example Japanies pole boats to come within 4 miles of a Albacore troll vessel durring fishing or daylight hrs It happens to be a fact that once the tuna start taking to the bait they will not feed on the jigs This also infringes on our bennifits and takes away from our freedom of the sea Let the bait boats find their own fish and we jig boats will do the same We would also request that the commission form a Pacific Albacore Trollers Fund for a collection of funds to aid our fishery in funding 3 observer vessels to resurch west of the dateline durring inseason the fishing season This would help enforcment to cover such a large ocean and give much needed scientific data as to the movment and harvesting of the Albacore tuna We have eager fishermen axious to enter the fishery but have little to no resourses to take a risk on loosing the season For example 130000000 USD per vessel per season would sufice That would be around 90000000 USD per year for 3 chartered vessels This would be a great benefit to all by having extra set of eyes and ears to help curb IUU fishing and give our

WCPFC16-2019-OP05,6.0,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 16th Regular Session Port Moresby Papua New Guinea 511 December 2019 WCPFC16 under WCPFC authority WWF further notes that the original agreed timelines have lapsed and there is now an urgent need to establish species specific harvest strategies consistent with the workplan WWF requests the WCPFC observe the importance of and strong support for these important management measures specifically the adoption of TRPs and HCRs for the key target species particularly from industry participants with Marine Stewardship Council MSC certification and many end markets Therefore WWF encourages WCPFC16 to maintain momentum on implementation of HS elements and where necessary take steps to recover timelines under the workplan WWF recommends that the WCPFC Support and endorse further implementation of CMM 201406 on Establishing a Harvest Strategy for Key Tuna Species in the WCPO consistent with proposed timelines Establish precautionary TRPs for bigeye BET and yellowfin YFT Adopt an HCR for the skipjack SKJ purse seine PS fishery and the South Pacific albacore SP ALB longline LL fishery that fluctuates around the established respective TRPs and Endorse the continued development and implementation of LRPs and TRPs for proper management of all stocks including sharks as a priority Sharks and Rays Sharks and Rays continue to make up a large percentage of annual bycatch1 with many shark species in the WCPO remaining subject to high levels of fishing mortality that current stock assessment trends suggest is unsustainable2 Furthermore WWF is increasingly concerned with shark conservation and sustainability in the WCPFC region as a whole and considers responsible management trade and consumption where shark mortality occurs in all fishing activities not just in circumstances where tuna fishing is occurring Therefore WCPFC must also recognise the needs of coastal States in the WCPFC region to manage their shark populations WWF is extremely disappointed by the failure of the Intersessional Working Group to develop agreed recommendations for a Comprehensive Shark CMM in 2018 Greater urgency toward shark conservation is required in the face of declining shark populations as evidenced by both the shortfin and longfin mako sharks being upgraded to Endangered globally in March this year and the perilous state of the oceanic whitetip shark in the WCPO SC15 concluded that the oceanic whitetip shark stock remains overfished and subject to overfishing and faces possible extinction despite the prohibition on retention reflecting poorly on WCPFCs current approaches to preventing the overfishing of sharks Therefore WWF urges WCPFC16 to prioritize finalizing a Comprehensive Shark CMM that ensures key shark and ray species including those prioritized by the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species CITES are effectively managed3 WWF continues to support recommendations within the proposed CMM to include methods to eliminate finning and incorporate language to encourage CCMs to land sharks with their fins naturally attached to their bodies as well as supporting recommendations4 Equally urgent is the need to introduce additional management measures as part of a recovery plan for the oceanic whitetip shark which include addressing catch data quality issues that have arisen due to the prohibition on retention While WWF supports the action of the WCPFC to adopt the Best Handling Practices For The Safe Release Of Sharks Other Than Whale Sharks And MantasMobulids we further recommend that additional requirements and procedures are necessary for nonretained shark species including provisions to ensure species ID and removal of trailing gear WWF also again asks the WCPFC16 to consider a prohibition to setting on or retention of manta rays genus Mobula and Manta and,wwf position statement to the wcpfc 16th regular session port moresby papua new guinea 511 december 2019

WCPFC16-2019-OP05,9.0,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 16th Regular Session Port Moresby Papua New Guinea 511 December 2019 WCPFC16 monitoring and documenting compliance with very important CMMs in the WCPO6 Therefore the WCPFC must consider securing appropriate observer coverage a top priority All CCMs agreed to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPF Convention text and other Commission obligations to ensure the best scientific information or evidence available is used in WCPFC decisions7 By its plain reading this obligation not only requires CCMs to actively seek out and use the best available scientific evidence but also compels CCMs to ensure that measures taken result in the generation of the best available scientific evidence8 Any other interpretation would be absurd Therefore the WCPFC is obligated under the WCPF Convention to put data collection processes in place that secure the production and use of the best available scientific evidence in the WCPFC decision making process Observer Safety and Security WWF again commends the WCPFCs previous actions to address issues with observer safety and security through the adoption of the observer safety and security provisions as well as the flag and coastal state requirements However WWF continues to strongly believe that more needs to be done to fully address observer safety and security WWF remains concerned with reports that some CCMs are still not meeting their obligations to provide observers with the required safety and security equipment It has been more than two years since CCMs agreed CMM 201703 Conservation and Management Measure for the Protection of WCPFC Regional Observer Programme Observers so the requirements must be met posthaste Additionally WWF maintains that there is a need for a full and transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents One of the outstanding gaps in observer safety and security is represented by the lack of information available to address observer incidents through proper followup and documentation A requirement for full and transparent reporting will allow for identification and understanding of potentially dangerous situations for future observers across all RFMOs Until the WCPFC can fully understand the circumstances surrounding these incidents it cannot hope to properly address them The ROP Annual Report as it currently exists does not provide the necessary level of detail to properly address these issues Thus WWF recommends establishing a required comprehensive and transparent reporting procedure for observers and observer programmes to report instances of threats harassment intimidation assault or death that national programmes and the ROP could then use to determine solutions to prevent future instances and share that information with other RFMOs This procedure must include an annual publicly available consolidated detailed and fully transparent report of all infractions against observers Calculation of Observer Coverage Metric Over 12 years ago the WCPFC established CMM 200701 which specified that fisheries observer coverage is to be 5 of effort in each nonpurse seine fishery under the jurisdiction of the Commission and shall be achieved no later than 30 June 20129 Specifically low observer coverage in the longline fishery was identified as a significant conservation risk As indicated by the discussion at that time as well as discussion among CCMs at WCPFC forums since the arbitrary benchmark established at 5 was considered a starting point for a stepwise progression toward appropriate observer coverage Not only has achieving the principal objective of CMM 200701 proven difficult but even measuring how it is achieved remains unsettled At the moment CCMs self report their longline observer coverage under four separate metrics including10 Days at Sea days observer is at sea compared to number of days fleet is at sea Number of Trips number of observer trips compared to trips by the fleet Days Fished observed fishing days compared to fleets fishing days and,wwf position statement to the wcpfc 16th regular session port moresby papua new guinea 511 december 2019 wcpfc16 monitoring and document compliance with very important cmm in the wcpo6 therefore the wcpfc must consider secure appropriate observer coverage a top priority all ccms agree to the convention on the conservation and management of highly migratory fish stock in the western and central pacific ocean wcpf convention text and other commission obligation to ensure the good scientific information or evidence available be use in wcpfc decisions7 by its plain reading this obligation not only require ccm to actively seek out and use the good available scientific evidence but also compel ccm to ensure that measure take result in the generation of the well available scientific evidence8 any other interpretation would be absurd therefore the wcpfc be obligate under the wcpf convention to put data collection process in place that secure the production and use of the well available scientific evidence in the wcpfc decision make process observer safety and security wwf again commend the wcpfc previous action to address issue with observer safety and security through the adoption of the observer safety and security provision as well as the flag and coastal state requirement however wwf continue to strongly believe that more need to be do to fully address observer safety and security wwf remain concerned with report that some ccm be still not meet their obligation to provide observer with the require safety and security equipment it have be more than two year since ccms agree cmm 201703 conservation and management measure for the protection of wcpfc regional observer programme observers so the requirement must be meet posthaste additionally wwf maintain that there be a need for a full and transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incident one of the outstanding gap in observer safety and security be represent by the lack of information available to address observer incident through proper followup and documentation a requirement for full and transparent reporting will allow for identification and understanding of potentially dangerous situation for future observer across all rfmo until the wcpfc can fully understand the circumstance surround these incident it can not hope to properly address they the rop annual report as it currently exist do not provide the necessary

WCPFC16-2019-OP05,11.0,WWF Position Number of Hooks number of hooks observed compared to fleet hooks used Because these metrics are each calculated differently and subject to different biases it places an undue burden on the scientific service provider to standardise data in such a way as to properly assess coverage First it forces the scientific service provider and ultimately the WCPFC to compare apples with oranges in a way that frustrates efficient analysis and ultimately timely and proper management Second by using a metric that is more susceptible measurement error bias and estimation error it leads to greater uncertainty and the problem of garbage in garbage out that leads to management failures Moreover because of the biases of the different metrics it creates inequity among CCMs that places more of the conservation burden on those using a more accurate and precise metric that is less susceptible to bias and manipulation The best available scientific information suggests that number of hooks represents the best method for achieving multiple objectives including effectively calculating effort and accurately assessing rare events like seabird interactions11 Furthermore three CCMs are currently assessing their observer coverage based on number of hooks hence it is practically feasible Consequently WWF recommends that the WCPFC confirm number of hooks as the best practice metric for all CCMs calculating observer coverage on longline vessels and mandate a 5year time frame to shift to use of this metric If other metrics for calculating coverage are used in the transition toward number of hooks the WCPFC should clearly define terms in advance and CCMs must calculate and report each metric in a way that is comparable to and consistent with number of hooks Level of Observer Coverage Recent efforts by the scientific service provider to standardise observer coverage data indicate that regionwide observer coverage could be at or slightly above 512 However the best available scientific evidence indicates that even a consistently applied level of 5 coverage is statistically and practically useless to effectively achieve most management13 or compliance objectives14 Low observer coverage exacerbates bias as a result of fishers altering their fishing practices eg discarding practices handling and release practices effort and gear when an observer is present which is a phenomenon known as the observer effect15 The higher the observer coverage rate the lower the bias from an observer effect is as the larger the proportion of fishing effort that is observed the more accurately the monitoring data characterize or represent the fishery Notwithstanding the observer effect at just 5 current observer coverage is neither producing the quality nor quantity of data necessary to adequately manage fisheries under WCPFC authority At present a lack of sufficient data that is typically generated through adequate observer coverage represents the single largest obstacle to establishing appropriate management measures Uncertainty is continually cited in the WCPFC process as a reason for inaction while the improved certainty offered by better observer coverage is consistently rejected In fact at the recent 15th Meeting of the Scientific Committee SC15 one member stated that they could not accept any requirement for observer coverage greater than 5 WWF concedes that different minimum levels of observer coverage may be appropriate for different management or compliance purposes depending on specific identified objectives However data collected under less than 100 coverage may be biased and misrepresent the fishery overall resulting in potential management failures Alternatively 100 observer coverage through human or electronic observers would result in no bias from an observer effect Thus along with a consortium of other NGOs and with the support of prominent market partners we have determined that because of conservation and compliance problems such as illegal fishing misreported or unreported catch and bycatch of endangered threatened and protected species that only an observer coverage rate of no less than 100 through human or electronic observers is acceptable16 By continuing to fail to secure a scientifically or statistically valid level of observer coverage on longline vessels the WCPFC fails to meet the charge of the WCPF Convention to generate and use the best available scientific information Therefore the WCPFC must take action to improve observer coverage across all longline vessels operating in the WCPFC Convention Area,wwf position number of hooks number of hook observe compare to fleet hook use because these metric be each calculate differently and subject to different bias it place an undue burden on the scientific service provider to standardise datum in such a way as to properly assess coverage first it force the scientific service provider and ultimately the wcpfc to compare apple with orange in a way that frustrate efficient analysis and ultimately timely and proper management second by use a metric that be more susceptible measurement error bias and estimation error it lead to great uncertainty and the problem of garbage in garbage out that lead to management failure moreover because of the bias of the different metric it create inequity among ccms that place more of the conservation burden on those use a more accurate and precise metric that be less susceptible to bias and manipulation the well available scientific information suggest that number of hook represent the good method for achieve multiple objective include effectively calculate effort and accurately assess rare event like seabird interactions11 furthermore three ccms be currently assess their observer coverage base on number of hook hence it be practically feasible consequently wwf recommend that the wcpfc confirm number of hook as the good

WCPFC16-2019-OP05,12.0,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 16th Regular Session Port Moresby Papua New Guinea 511 December 2019 WCPFC16 WWF recommends the WCPFC Ensure the requirements of CMM 201703 have been met Endorse further observer safety and security measures including fully transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents and entities involved Endorse the calculation of observer coverage on the basis of number of hooks as best practice and mandate a transition to calculation of observer coverage based on number of hooks by 2025 and Establish a plan to increase observer coverage by human observers or electronic monitoring across all longline vessels operating in the WCPFC Convention Area on an annual basis to achieve 100 coverage by 2025 Transhipment Monitoring Transhipment remains one of the most prominent weaknesses in catch documentation and verification that leads to Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU catch in the WCPO WWF notes that the most simple efficient and effective solution to the challenges of transhipmentrelated IUU is to simply prohibit all atsea transhipment and require all fishing vessels to either tranship or land their catch at the nearest available designated port in the WCPO following the conclusion of fishing activity However acknowledging that a prohibition on transhipment is politically unlikely at this time WWF supports the establishment of the Transhipment Intersessional Working Group and associated review and revision of CMM 200906 to address deficiencies in the current measure Some CCMs remain consistently noncompliant with CMM 200906 Reports presented at TCC15 indicate that the number of reported high seas transhipment events increased 155 between 2014 and with an increase of 29 between 2017 and 2018 These CCMs also continue to fail to meet their reporting obligations Therefore given the high risk of transhipment to facilitate IUU fishing and the ongoing noncompliance associated with the practice the WCPFC must urgently address the deficiencies in CMM 200906 WWF recommends the WCPFC Implement real time or near realtime reporting requirements for all components of transhipments including electronic verification and validation tools Review and revise CMM 200906 including replacing the impracticability test and unfettered flag State authorization with clear criteria and a process for the WCPFC to review issued flag State authorizations against those criteria to ensure compliance Include bunkering vessels in transhipment management arrangements and Consider

WCPFC16-2019-OP09,3.0,Submitted by The Pew Charitable Trusts A Checklist for Fisheries Management in the Western and Central Pacific Managers must conserve tunas and sharks reform transshipment and end illegal fishing Nov 2019 Brief Overview The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC is responsible for the longterm conservation and management of highly migratory fish stocks including tunas and sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean The Pew Charitable Trusts calls on the Commission to fulfil this responsibility by taking the following actions at its 16th annual meeting from 511 December in Port Moresby Papua New Guinea Ken JonesGetty Advance the creation of harvest strategies to support sustainable fisheries WCPFC has made considerable progress in developing harvest strategies for tunas in accordance with conservation and management measure CMM 201406 and its harvest strategy workplan At this meeting the Commission should q Adopt terms of reference for creating a Harvest Strategy Development Working Group to facilitate interaction between scientists managers and other parties q Dedicate adequate funding to advance the management strategy evaluation MSE processes for skipjack South Pacific albacore yellowfin and bigeye tunas q Provide feedback on the initial results of the skipjack MSE including candidate harvest control rules q Adopt interim target reference points TRPs for bigeye and yellowfin tunas at their current levels of biomass until the necessary data and analyses are available to factor in socioeconomic objectives Setting TRPs at current biomass levels would achieve the objectives of CMM 201801 to prevent biomass decline q Require at least a 70 per cent chance of meeting these interim TRPs to ensure that the populations achieve them more often than not q Adopt a CMM to reduce fishing mortality of South Pacific albacore to make progress towards achieving the TRP q Adopt the Northern Committees NC15 recommendation to develop a harvest strategy for north Pacific swordfish but recommend using an MSE to assess the performance of potential harvest strategies Reject catch increases for Pacific bluefin tuna and support progress on a precautionary harvest strategy Pacific bluefin tuna remains severely depleted and urgent action is required to end overfishing and develop a precautionary longterm harvest strategy that uses an MSE At its 2019 meeting NC15 took a step forward by recommending terms of reference for the MSE process and candidate harvest strategy elements for testing in the MSE Unfortunately NC15 also proposed additional exemptions to the current management measure that loosen restrictions on quota transfers and carryforwards effectively increasing the catch allowed in 2020 and threatening to delay rebuilding of the stock This is too risky because there is only a 3 per cent chance that the rebuilding plan will be successful if recruitment is assumed to stay low Effective management is based on setting sustainable quotas that consider uncertainty surrounding current and future conditions The Commission should q Reject NC15s recommendation to add exemptions to the management measure which would increase catches of Pacific bluefin q Recommend that NC15 include in the terms of reference a workplan to complete the MSE in 2024 and implement a precautionary harvest strategy in 2025 It should include testing the rebuilding strategy q Recommend that NC15 amend the proposed harvest strategy elements to include more precautionary reference points for evaluation including FSPR50 as a target and 30SSBF0 as a threshold reference point which would provide a greater buffer from the limit reference point Adopt measures that support the recovery of oceanic whitetip sharks CMM 201104 banned the retention of oceanic whitetip sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean Fishing mortality of this species has been reduced but it is still too highestimated at twice its maximum sustainable yield Spawning biomass has been reduced to just 4 per cent of unfished biomass The 2019 stock assessment concluded that there is a substantial risk that oceanic whitetip sharks will become extinct if the level of fishing mortality continues The Scientific Committee SC15 this year recommended more efforts to mitigate catch and improve safe handling and release practices Prohibiting the use of wire leaders and shark lines would cut fishingrelated mortality2 Better safehandling techniques such as cutting the trailing gear as close to the hook as possible and keeping the shark in the water alongside the vessel are also needed to further reduce mortality Furthermore SC15 urged that observer coverage on longline vessels be increased to improve data collection for longline fisheries The WCPFC should q Adopt more measures to reduce oceanic whitetip shark mortality such as prohibiting wire leaders and shark lines and improving safehandling techniques q Increase observer coverage to improve data collection Strengthen protections on vulnerable manta and mobula rays Caught as bycatch by longline and purse seine vessels in the western and central Pacific Ocean six species of manta and mobula rays are vulnerable to overfishing and the Commission has added them to the list of key shark species for assessment To reduce mortality and encourage live release the Commission has adopted guidelines for best handling practices for mobulids By listing these species on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and Appendix I and II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals the global community has expressed its concern for their status regulating the trade and take respectively The Commission should q Prohibit the retention of manta and mobula rays caught in the Convention area and require that vessels follow the WCPFCs safe handling guidelines to facilitate live release wildestanimalGetty Strengthen port State measures to fight illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing Port control and inspection measures are a costeffective way to prevent IUU catch from entering the market A recent study supported by The Pew Charitable Trusts found that 10 WCPFC States fall in the top quarter of those most at risk of having illegally caught fish pass through their ports3 While the WCPFC adopted a set of voluntary port State minimum standards CMM 201702 in 2017 they must be strengthened to meet internationally recognized standards and best practices adopted by other regional fisheries management organizations RFMOs CMM 201702 encourages Commission members cooperating members and nonmembers CCMs to designate ports for inspection of foreign vessels and establishes inspection and informationsharing procedures However only five of almost 40 port CCMs have designated ports and contact points and the WCPFC has received no reports of resulting port inspections This year the Technical and Compliance Committee TCC15 reviewed a proposal by Canada to revise the measure to require prior notification from vessels wishing to use ports allow for denial of entry into port or use of port with denials to be reported to the WCPFC Secretariat require inspections of vessels previously denied access to port and specify a format for reporting port inspections These provisions would bring the WCPFC one step closer to the standard in the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations Port State Measures Agreement other RFMOs stricter port State measures and the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency Regional Port State Measures Framework The WCPFC should q Urge port States to designate ports for inspection of foreign vessels to improve implementation of the port State measures adopted by the WCPFC q Adopt improved minimum standards for port State measures in line with Canadas proposal to the TCC15 Encourage States to obtain IMO numbers for vessels to improve oversight of fishing International Maritime Organization vessel identification numbers IMO numbers are another essential tool in the fight against IUU fishing because they improve monitoring control and surveillance of fishing operations In 2018 the Commission adopted CMM 201806 which requires IMO numbers for all motorized inboard fishing vessels from less than 100 gross registered tons GRT down to 12 meters long that are authorized to fish in the Convention area beyond flag States areas of national jurisdiction The requirement takes effect 1 April 2020 so flag States should use the next few months to ensure that they will be in compliance The Commission should q Reiterate that flag States must obtain IMO numbers for all eligible vessels authorized to operate within the Convention area and submit this information to the WCPFC Improve transshipment regulations to ensure legal and verifiable seafood supply chains Transshipment at sea in the western and central Pacific Ocean continues to provide opportunities for unscrupulous operators to avoid proper catch reporting and launder IUU catch A Pew report found that transshipment management in WCPFC is compromised by a lack of reporting noncompliance with reporting requirements and nonstandardized reporting responses by CCMs in their Annual Report Part I submissions The number of reported high seas transshipment events rose more than 155 per cent between 2014 552 events and 2018 1409 eventsthe highest number reported in the Convention area with a 29 per cent increase between 2017 and 20184 The regulatory framework requires significant strengthening standardization and harmonization regardless of whether current reporting requirements are being met The WCPFC should q Ensure that the intersessional working group has enough resources and support to carry out the analysis identified in section 5a of its terms of reference and encourage all CCMs to fully participate in its work Adam BaskeThe Pew Charitable Trusts Adopt minimum standards for electronic monitoring and move towards 100 per cent observer coverage CMMs do not require sufficient and timely submission or verification of critical fishing data which contributes to ineffective management of the tuna longline fisheries in the Convention area Electronic monitoring EM technology has been proved to be a costeffective option to expand observer coverage without placing additional personnel onboard Last year the Commission agreed to prioritize EM in areas in which independent data collection and verification is low Subsequently Project 93 reviewed how EM could address data gaps within the Commission In an initial assessment it found that the biggest data gaps exist where observer coverage is low particularly in longline fisheries and suggested that electronic monitoring can significantly improve compliance and data verification for these vessels EM is particularly valuable for target species caught under catch limits without 100 per cent observer coverage The Commission should q Prioritize the development and adoption of the necessary standards and infrastructure needed to successfully implement electronic reporting and monitoring q Require 100 per cent observer coverage for all longline operations through a mix of human observers and electronic systems Strengthen the compliance monitoring scheme CMS to improve its effectiveness A robust CMS can help the Commission fulfil its obligations under the WCPFC Convention and is essential to achieving sustainable fisheries WCPFCs CMS allows States to identify areas in which they need help to improve compliance But it lacks penalties to deter noncompliance and does not permit civil society observers to attend meetings during which compliance reports are reviewed A strengthened CMS would help the Commission verify that flag States are meeting their obligations level the playing field for the fishing industry and ensure that conservation measures are not undermined Last year the WCPFC adopted a new CMS that includes a list of outstanding tasks The Commission should make progress on those tasks to ensure that it fully and transparently supports the WCPFCs objectives It should q Mandate that flag States provide the information that would allow the WCPFC to verify that they are fulfilling their obligations and resolve allegations of noncompliance q Create penalties for serious or persistent noncompliance q Permit observer organizations to be present at compliance discussions in accordance with the WCPFC Conventions language on transparency Article 21 Endnotes Regarding reference points FSPR50 is the fishing mortality rate that would allow the stock to attain 50 per cent of the maximum spawning potential in the

rigorous analytical approach to improve public policy inform the public and invigorate civic life,submit by the pew charitable trusts a checklist for fisheries management in the western and central pacific managers must conserve tuna and shark reform transshipment and end illegal fishing nov 2019 brief overview the western and central pacific fisheries commission wcpfc be responsible for the longterm conservation and management of highly migratory fish stock include tuna and shark in the western and central pacific ocean the pew charitable trusts call on the commission to fulfil this responsibility by take the follow action at its 16th annual meeting from 511 december in port moresby papua new guinea ken jonesgetty advance the creation of harvest strategy to support sustainable fishery wcpfc have make considerable progress in develop harvest strategy for tuna in accordance with conservation and management measure cmm 201406 and its harvest strategy workplan at this meeting the commission should q adopt term of reference for create a harvest strategy development working group to facilitate interaction between scientist manager and other party q dedicate adequate funding to advance the management strategy evaluation mse process for skipjack south pacific albacore yellowfin and bigeye tunas q provide feedback on the initial result of the skipjack mse include candidate harvest control rule q adopt interim target reference point trp for bigeye and yellowfin tuna at their current level of biomass until the necessary datum and analysis be available to factor in socioeconomic objective set trp at current biomass level would achieve the objective of cmm 201801 to prevent biomass decline q require at least a 70 per cent chance of meet these interim trp to ensure that the population achieve they more often than not q adopt a cmm to reduce fishing mortality of south pacific albacore to make progress towards achieve the trp q adopt the northern committees nc15 recommendation to develop a harvest strategy for north pacific swordfish but recommend use an mse to assess the performance of potential harvest strategy reject catch increase for pacific bluefin tuna and support progress on a precautionary harvest strategy pacific bluefin tuna remains severely deplete and urgent action be require to end overfishe and develop a precautionary longterm harvest strategy that use an mse at its 2019 meeting nc15 take a step forward by recommend term of reference for the mse process and candidate harvest strategy element for test in the mse unfortunately nc15 also propose additional exemption to the current management measure that loosen restriction on quota transfer and carryforward effectively increase the catch allow in 2020 and threaten to delay rebuilding of the stock this be too risky because there be only a 3 per cent chance that the rebuilding plan will be successful if recruitment be assume to stay low effective management be base on set sustainable quota that consider uncertainty surround current and future condition the commission should q reject nc15s recommendation to add exemption to the management measure which would increase catch of pacific bluefin q recommend that nc15 include in the term of reference a workplan to complete the mse in 2024 and implement a precautionary harvest strategy in 2025 it should include test the rebuilding strategy q recommend that nc15 amend the propose harvest strategy element to include more precautionary reference point for evaluation include fspr50 as a target and 30ssbf0 as a threshold reference point which would provide a great buffer from the limit reference point adopt measure that support the recovery of oceanic whitetip shark cmm 201104 ban the retention of oceanic whitetip shark in the western and central pacific ocean fishing mortality of this specie have be reduce but it be still too highestimate at twice its maximum sustainable yield spawning biomass have be reduce to just 4 per cent of unfished biomass the 2019 stock assessment conclude that there be a substantial risk that oceanic whitetip shark will become extinct if the level of fishing mortality continue the scientific committee sc15 this year recommend more effort to mitigate catch and improve safe handling and release practice prohibit the use of wire leader and shark line would cut fishingrelate mortality2 well safehandle technique such as cut the trail gear as close to the hook as possible and keep the shark in the water alongside the vessel be also need to far reduce mortality furthermore sc15 urge that observer coverage on longline vessel be increase to improve datum collection for longline fishery the wcpfc should q adopt more measure to reduce oceanic whitetip shark mortality such as prohibit wire leader and shark line and improve safehandle technique q increase observer coverage to improve data collection strengthen protection on vulnerable manta and mobula ray catch as bycatch by longline and purse seine vessel in the western and central pacific ocean six specie of manta and mobula ray be vulnerable to overfishing and the commission have add they to the list of key shark specie for assessment to reduce mortality and encourage live release the commission have adopt guideline for good handling practice for mobulid by list these specie on appendix ii of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora and appendix i and ii of the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals the global community have express its concern for their status regulate the trade and take respectively the commission should q prohibit the retention of manta and mobula ray catch in the convention area and require that vessel follow the wcpfcs safe handling guideline to facilitate live release wildestanimalgetty strengthen port state measure to fight illegal unreported and unregulated iuu fishing port control and inspection measure be a costeffective way to prevent iuu catch from enter the market a recent study support by the pew charitable trusts find that 10 wcpfc states fall in the top quarter of those most at risk of having illegally catch fish pass through their ports3 while the wcpfc adopt a set of voluntary port state minimum standard cmm 201702 in 2017 they must be strengthen to meet internationally recognize standard and good practice adopt by other regional fishery management organization rfmo cmm 201702 encourage commission member cooperate member and nonmember ccms to designate port for inspection of foreign vessel and establish inspection and informationsharing procedure however only five of almost 40 port ccm have designate port and contact point and the wcpfc have receive no report of result port inspection this year the technical and compliance committee tcc15 review a proposal by canada to revise the measure to require prior notification from vessel wish to use port allow for denial of entry into port or use of port with denial to be report to the wcpfc secretariat require inspection of vessel previously deny access to port and specify a format for report port inspection these provision would bring the wcpfc one step close to the standard in the un food and agriculture organizations port state measures agreement other rfmo strict port state measure and the pacific islands forum fisheries agency regional port state measures framework the wcpfc should q urge port state to designate port for inspection of foreign vessel to improve implementation of the port state measure adopt by the wcpfc q adopt improved minimum standard for port state measure in line with canadas proposal to the tcc15 encourage states to obtain imo number for vessel to improve oversight of fish international maritime organization vessel identification number imo number be another essential tool in the fight against iuu fish because they improve monitor control and surveillance of fishing operation in 2018 the commission adopt cmm 201806 which require imo number for all motorize inboard fishing vessel from less than 100 gross register ton grt down to 12 meter long that be authorize to fish in the convention area beyond flag states area of national jurisdiction the requirement take effect 1 april 2020 so flag states should use the next few month to ensure that they will be in compliance the commission should q reiterate that flag state must obtain imo number for all eligible vessel authorize to operate within the convention area and submit this information to the wcpfc improve transshipment regulation to ensure legal and verifiable seafood supply chain transshipment at sea in the western and central pacific ocean continue to provide opportunity for unscrupulous operator to avoid proper catch reporting and launder iuu catch a pew report find that transshipment management in wcpfc be compromise by a lack of report noncompliance with reporting requirement and nonstandardize report response by ccm in their annual report part i submission the number of report high sea transshipment event rise more than 155 per cent between 2014 552 event and 2018 1409 eventsthe high number report in the convention area with a 29 per cent increase between 2017 and 20184 the regulatory framework require significant strengthen standardization and harmonization regardless of whether current reporting requirement be be meet the wcpfc should q ensure that the intersessional working group have enough resource and support to carry out the analysis identify in section 5a of its term of reference and encourage all ccm to fully participate in its work adam baskethe pew charitable trusts adopt minimum standard for electronic monitoring and move towards 100 per cent observer coverage cmm do not require sufficient and timely submission or verification of critical fishing datum which contribute to ineffective management of the tuna longline fishery in the convention area electronic monitoring em technology have be prove to be a costeffective option to expand observer coverage without place additional personnel onboard last year the commission agree to prioritize em in area in which independent datum collection and verification be low subsequently project 93 review how em could address data gap within the commission in an initial assessment it find that the big data gap exist where observer coverage be low particularly in longline fishery and suggest that electronic monitoring can significantly improve compliance and datum verification for these vessel em be particularly valuable for target specie catch under catch limit without 100 per cent observer coverage the commission should q prioritize the development and adoption of the necessary standard and infrastructure need to successfully implement electronic reporting and monitor q require 100 per cent observer coverage for all longline operation through a mix of human observer and electronic system strengthen the compliance monitor scheme cms to improve its effectiveness a robust cms can help the commission fulfil its obligation under the wcpfc convention and be essential to achieve sustainable fishery wcpfc cms allow states to identify area in which they need help to improve compliance but it lack penalty to deter noncompliance and do not permit civil society observer to attend meeting during which compliance report be review a strengthen cms would help the commission verify that flag state be meet their obligation level the playing field for the fishing industry and ensure that conservation measure be not undermine last year the wcpfc adopt a new cms that include a list of outstanding task the commission should make progress on those task to ensure that it fully and transparently support the wcpfcs objective it should q mandate that flag state provide the information that would allow the wcpfc to verify that they be fulfil their

submitted on behalf of the undersigned companies nongovernmental organizations and fishing industry associations all of whom recognize that the sustainability of tuna stocks is integral to businesses and livelihoods as well as to the health of the marine environment Your government serves as an important leader in tuna stock sustainability as a member of one or more of the four regional fisheries management organizations RFMOs charged with managing the worlds tropical tuna fisheries We are writing to bring to your attention our collective views on several issues crucial to the longterm sustainability of tuna stocks The development and implementation of comprehensive precautionary harvest strategies Effective monitoring and management of fish aggregating devices FADs Strengthened monitoring control and surveillance tools including increased observer coverage in purse seine and longline fisheries and of atsea transshipment activity through human observers andor electronic monitoring Greater focus on implementation of bycatch mitigation actions with an emphasis on longline fisheries We recognize that some tuna RFMOs have made progress on several of these issues and we applaud those actions However we wish to underscore that while the progress todate is positive accelerated actions must be taken at this years RFMO meetings to Develop and implement comprehensive precautionary harvest strategies with specific timelines for all tuna stocks including the adoption and implementation of target and limit reference points harvest control rules monitoring strategies operational objectives performance indicators management strategy evaluation and appropriate tools to achieve exploitation levels Increase compliance with mandatory minimum 5 longline observer coverage rates by identifying and sanctioning noncompliance Adopt and implement a 100 observer coverage requirement human andor electronic within five years for longline and purse seine fisheries where not already required Adopt and implement a 100 observer coverage requirement human andor electronic for atsea transshipment activities as well as other measures as defined in the Best Practices for WellManaged AtSea Transshipment document developed through the NGO Tuna Forum that ensure transshipment activity is transparent and wellmanaged and that all required data is fully collected and
