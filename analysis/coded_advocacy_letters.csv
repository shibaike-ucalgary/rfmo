WCPFC3-2006-OP02,1,Seabird bycatch mitigation measures in pelagic fisheries BirdLife International
WCPFC3-2006-OP02,2,On 14 October 2006 a workshop was held to prioritise research needed to address seabird bycatch mitigation in pelagic longline fisheries In addition the workshop participants shared knowledge on known and potential seabird bycatch mitigation measures in pelagic fisheries examining the effectiveness of measures on both surfaceforaging and diving seabirds and their practicality and safety when used on fishing vessels The workshop was organised by Washington Sea Grant University of Washington and was staged in Hobart to take advantage of experts present for the annual meeting of the ad hoc Working Group on Incidental Mortality Arising from Fishing IMAF of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources CCAMLR
WCPFC3-2006-OP02,3,Recognising the intention of the WCPFC to discuss seabird bycatch mitigation measures in December and the seabird mitigation recommendation drafted by the 2006 meeting of the WCPFC Scientific Committee this document summarises knowledge shared at the meeting The attached table discusses strengths and weaknesses of each mitigation measure the need for combinations of measures and current data gaps Table 1 A full copy of the workshop report is available at wwwwsgwashingtonedu
WCPFC3-2006-OP02,4,Conclusions
WCPFC3-2006-OP02,5,The seabird recommendation from the WCPFC Scientific Committee in August 2006 would be a highly constructive step to reduce seabird bycatch in the WCPFC area
WCPFC3-2006-OP02,6,With the exception of bait casters the mitigation measures listed are a good depiction of measures believed to reduce seabird bycatch in pelagic fisheries However caveats are associated with most measures This reiterates the point made at the WCPFC Ecosystem Bycatch meeting on the need to use combinations of measures All fisheries in which seabird bycatch mitigation has been successful have found that combinations of measures are essential As stated at the WCPFC Ecosystem Bycatch meeting the strength of the Column A and Column B approach is that it requires such combinations while also providing flexibility to select the combination most suited to their vessel
WCPFC3-2006-OP02,7,Streamer lines night setting and weighted branch lines can be highly effective mitigation measures when used properly and in combination Sidesetting has been found effective in Hawaiian fisheries when combined with line weighting and a setting curtain However research is urgently needed to test the effectiveness of sidesetting in the Southern Ocean where deeperdiving seabird species are common Further testing is also recommended on the effectiveness of bluedyed squid in the Southern Ocean on the effectiveness of lineshooters and on best practises for offal management A plan for research developed across pelagic fishery RFMOs would provide the necessary tools to reduce seabird mortality in pelagic fisheries worldwide As noted at the 2006 WCPFC Scientific Committee meeting the recommendations on seabird mitigation measures should be considered as interim Measures will need to be reevaluated as more information becomes available through research
WCPFC3-2006-OP02,8,Recommendation to the Third Meeting of the WCPFC A seabird Conservation Measure based on the recommendation from the WCPFC Scientific Committee would be a highly constructive step to reduce seabird bycatch in the WCPFC area The strength of the recommendation lies in its requirement for the use of two mitigation measures providing the necessary use of a combination of measures while also providing flexibility for fishermen to select the combination most suited to their vessel Table 1 Review of seabird bycatch mitigation measures listed in the seabird recommendation from the WCPFC Scientific Committee Column A Scientific evidence for effectiveness in pelagic fisheries Caveats Notes Need for combination Research needs Minimum standards Night setting Duckworth 1995 Brothers et al 1999 Gales et al Klaer Polacheck Brothers et al 1999 McNamara et al 1999 Gilman et al 2005 Baker Wise 2005 Less effective during full moon under intensive deck lighting or in high latitude fisheries in summer Less effective on nocturnal foragers eg White chinned Petrels Brothers et al Cherel et al 1996 Recommend combination with tori lines andor weighted branch lines Data on current time of sets by WCPFC fisheries Effect of night sets on target catch for different fisheries Night defined as nautical dark to nautical dawn Side setting Brothers Gilman 2006 Yokota Kiyota 2006 Only effective if hooks are sufficiently below the surface by the time they reach the stern of the vessel In Hawaii sidesetting trials were conducted with bird curtain and 4560g weighted swivels placed within 05m of hooks Japanese research concludes must be used with other measures Yokota Kiyota 2006 Must be combined with other measures Successful Hawaii trials use bird curtain plus weighted branch lines In Southern Hemisphere strongly recommend use wth tori lines until sidesetting is tested in the region Currently untested in the Southern Ocean against seabird assemblages with diving seabirds and albatrosses urgent need for research In Japan NRIFSF will continue testing in 2007 In Hawaii side setting is used in conjunction with a bird curtain and 45 weighted swivel within 1m of the baited hook Single tori line Imber 1994 Uozomi Takeuchi 1998 Brothers et al 1999 Klaer Polacheck McNamara et al Boggs 2001 CCAMLR 2002 Minami Kiyota 2004 Melvin 2003 Effective only when streamers are positioned over sinking baits In pelagic fisheries baited hooks are unlikely to sink beyond the diving depths of diving seabirds within the 150m zone of the tori line unless combined with other measures such as line weighting or underwater setting Entanglement with fishing gear can lead to poor compliance by fishers and design issues need to be addressed In crosswinds tori line must be deployed from the windward side to be effective Effectiveness increased when combined with other measures eg weighted branch lines andor night setting Optimal design for pelagic fisheries still under development refine to minimise tangling optimise aerial extent and positioning and ease haulingretrieval Current research by Ed Melvin Washington Sea Grant also program for small vessels by Global Guardian Trust in Japan Controlled studies demonstrating their effectiveness in pelagic fisheries remain very limited Current minimum standards for pelagic fisheries are based on CCAMLR Conservation Measure 2502

WCPFC3-2006-OP02,17,Management of offal discharge If tori line is selected from both column A and column B this equates to simultaneously using two ie paired tori lines In other areas where necessary CCMs are encouraged to employ one or more of the seabird mitigation measures listed in Table 1 Other mitigation measures may be tested under bona fide research programmes Every effort should be made to ensure that seabirds captured alive during longlining are released alive and that wherever possible hooks are removed without jeopardising the life of the seabird concerned CCMs are encouraged to seek feedback from fishers and observers on the effectiveness and practicality of mitigation measures These measures should be reviewed regularly particularly when information becomes available on new or existing measures or on seabird interactions from observer or other monitoring programmes An updated suite of recommended measures should then be considered To the extent possible CCMs should endeavour to harmonise their NPOAs with these measures
WCPFC3-2006-OP03,1,WWF TRAFFIC OCEANIA STATEMENT TO THE 3RD SESSION OF THE WESTERN CENTRAL PACIFIC FISHERIES COMMISSION
WCPFC3-2006-OP03,2,Apia Samoa 15 December 2006
WCPFC3-2006-OP03,3,INTRODUCTION Since the second annual meeting of the WCPFC in December 2005 there have been some significant developments in global fisheries conservation and management Primary among these was the United Nations Fish Stocks Review Conference in May 2006 at which a key issue of focus was the performance of the worlds 16 regional fisheries management organizations RFMOs The focus on RFMOs at the UNFSA Review Conference is part of ongoing international efforts to address the reasons for the widespread failure of RFMOs to prevent overfishing degradation of the marine ecosystems and suboptimal benefits accruing to coastal States fishing States and their legitimate fishing industries Multilateral bilateral and unilateral efforts are underway to identify the reasons for these failures and move rapidly to implement effective measures to address them Initiatives such as the Ministeriallyled High Sea Task Force on Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing which released its final report in March 2006 the MCS Network and the meeting of the five tuna RFMOs to be hosted by Japan early in 2007 represent some of these efforts As a contribution to international efforts at the UNFSA Review Conference WWF and TRAFFIC released the report Follow the Leader learning from experience and best practice in regional fisheries management organisations The WCPF Convention is arguably the most innovative and farreaching RFMO in force to date Given that it was negotiated postUNFSA the Convention reflects much of what is widely regarded as international best practice in areas such as recognition of the precautionary approach facilitating developing State participation explicit acknowledgement of allocation and evolved decisionmaking processes The responsibilities of the Commission can not be understated it is responsible not only for the conservation and management of the worlds largest tuna fishery supplying almost half of the global supply but also for the broader marine ecosystem upon which the longterm prosperity of this fishery relies In the context of the current and growing international focus on the performance of RFMOs there are high expectations from the international community that the WCPFC has the tools at its disposal to succeed where other RFMOs have failed To meet these expectations WWF and TRAFFIC consider the following to be priorities for action PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH Bigeye Tuna and Yellowfin Tuna management The Commissions decision at its 2005 meeting to limit catch and effort at record levels was contrary to the advice of its Scientific Committee and the precautionary approach The Scientific Committees advice to this meeting is similar to that in 2005 if not more pessimistic with regard to Bigeye Tuna The advice from the Scientific Committee is that a reduction in fishing mortality of 39 is required to maintain the Bigeye Tuna biomass at a level 20 above that which will produce maximum sustainable yield MSY Similarly a reduction in fishing mortality on Yellowfin Tuna is required to maintain biomass at a level 20 above the level at which MSY is produced In the context of the Scientific Committees advice WWF and TRAFFIC draw the Commissions attention to the fact that under the precautionary approach set out under UNFSA MSY is minimum standard for a limit reference point not a target reference point ie stocks should be maintained at levels above those that can produce MSY WWF and TRAFFIC draw the attention of the Commission to Conservation and Management Measure CMM 200501 concerning Bigeye and Yellowfin Tuna which provides for the catch and effort levels set under that CMM to be reviewed annually in light of the Scientific Committees advice WWF urges the Commission to follow the advice of SC2 and take action to reduce catch of Bigeye and Yellowfin at this meeting Additionally priority should be given to developing and adopting a robust Management Evaluation Strategy MSE prior to the expiration of the threeyear limit on longline catch levels for Bigeye Tuna established under CMM 200501 The MSE would then provide a decisionmaking framework within which the current catch and effort limits can be reassessed The Scientific Committee considered the development of a MSE to be the highest level of priority in its future work programme and we call on Members to provide the necessary extraordinary funding for this work to be urgently undertaken Action to address the ongoing overfishing of Bigeye Tuna and Yellowfin Tuna may pervert the flow of economic benefits from the longline and purse seine fisheries respectively in the short to medium term In this context we would draw the attention of Members to their unilateral and collective obligations under Article 5 of this Convention among others to apply the precautionary approach and prevent these stocks from moving to an overfished state Traderelated measures Traderelated measures for tuna species is not a new concept and much work has been done to assess the different forms that these measures can take and the effectiveness of various systems in meeting objectives TRAFFIC and WWF have undertaken a number of analyses of the effectiveness and deficiencies in traderelated measures adopted by RFMOs including most recently that of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna Given the global nature of trade in tuna products and the laundering of catches already known to occur it is inevitable that the Commission will need to consider some form of a traderelated measure for the WCPFC WWF and TRAFFIC believe that a priority for the Commission is to ensure that the objectives of its traderelated measure are clearly stated to provide a basis against which to the pros and cons of different schemes and to ensure that the deficiencies in the schemes of other RFMOs are not repeated More specifically proposals to implement a pareddown statistical documentation scheme SDS need to be carefully examined in the light of deficiencies already exposed in systems that deal only with the trade component rather than being inclusive of catch as well Given that the Commission has already signaled its intention to move rapidly to allocate fishing opportunities as well as existing concerns about levels of illegal unregulated and unreported IUU fishing in the Convention area WWF and TRAFFIC consider that the most cost and conservationeffective way forward is for the Commission to adopt a catch documentation scheme from the outset rather than subject the fishing industry and the membership to a series of iterative steps towards such a comprehensive scheme over a number of years Transhipment WWF and TRAFFIC are fully aware that accurate reporting of catches is essential in assessing the health of the fishery Transhipment requirements are articulated in Article 29 of the Convention and Annex III Article 4 Identifying designated ports for transhipment taking into account exceptional situations where this may not be possible will reduce and discourage IUU related activities With the understanding that the adoption of transshipment guidelines will be made at WCPFC4 as per the recommendation from the Technical and Compliance Committee TCC to the Commission we would like to encourage the Commission to move forward with its recommendation to develop transhipment guidelines prior to WCPFC4
WCPFC3-2006-OP03,4,With respect to the precautionary approach WWF and TRAFFIC call for a 39 reduction in fishing mortality of BET in line with the SC advice on maintaining biomass 20 above levels producing MSY a 26 reduction in fishing mortality of YFT in line with the SC advice on maintaining biomass 20 above levels producing MSY a Management Strategy Evaluation framework be developed as a matter of urgency and adopted no later than the 5th annual session of the Commission in 2008 the development and adoption of a comprehensive catch documentation scheme with the ability to track catch from vessel to market State transshipment requirements that effectively address IUU fishing to be developed prior to WCPFC4
WCPFC3-2006-OP03,5,ECOSYSTEM APPROACH TO FISHERIES MANAGEMENT WWF and TRAFFIC welcome the intersessional work done and congratulate the Scientific Committee and its subsidiary bodies There are a number of areas with respect to species of special interest and broader ecosystem considerations that we would like to highlight Species of special interest Turtles Populations of sea turtles are vulnerable to even smallscale adult mortality resulting from longline bycatch WWF and numerous partners are engaged in collaborative trials for longline bycatch mitigation in the eastern and western Pacific and have also encouraged through the Smartgear competition the development of innovative and adaptive fishing gears designed to reduce bycatch We are encouraged to see that many countries catching tuna in the Convention area are likewise testing alternative gear such as circle hooks WWF and TRAFFIC support the general recommendations for sea turtle data collection and research of the Scientific Committee in 2006 particularly the identification of those fishery sectors with a turtle bycatch problem as well as the recommendation for a flexible approach based on scientific research to sea turtle mitigation measures However this research must result in action in a timely manner As turtle bycatch hotspots are identified the Commission must require concrete mitigation action from CCMs such as widespread gear change seasonal closures in such hotspots rather than supporting an ongoing research programme Sharks WWF and TRAFFIC are encouraged by the recognition of the Commission of the vulnerability of shark species to the impacts of fishing and the need to implement measures to mitigate these impacts In this context TRAFFIC is close to completing an analysis of shark conservation measures adopted by other RFMOs and has identified both deficiencies and best practice arising from this analysis The analysis reiterates that the key to sustainable shark fisheries is to understand and manage the level of mortality incurred by fishing Effective management requires reliable species or stockspecific information on biology and total mortality landings and discards and precautionary limits in the face of uncertainty While all shark species are relatively more vulnerable to overfishing than most other marine fishes within the shark category the level of vulnerability varies considerably There is an urgent need to improve our understanding of shark mortality on a species basis and it is important therefore that information is collected on this basis and that riskbased management measures are adopted for individual species where necessary The approach adopted by a number of other RFMOs in response to these requirements has been to implement bans on shark finning However the extent to which finning bans will achieve shark conservation depends on how they are applied The key element of the bans is the requirement to land both the trunk and the fins and there are a number of ways in which this requirement can be applied from relying on a ratio of fintobody weight to requiring the landing of whole specimens Clearly a fintobody ratio provides the least contribution to data collection and creates difficulties for enforcement To maximise effectiveness with respect to these objectives and account for the practicalities of fishing WWF and TRAFFIC recommend that sharks should be landed headed and gutted with skins fins claspers dorsal spines where applicable attached This approach maximises product quality and makes a significant contribution to shark species identification quantification of weight of catch and enforcement It is also the approach recommended by FAO in its Technical Guidelines for Responsible Fisheries Further to provide a basis for effective shark conservation into the future the CMM needs to relate to all species of the Class Chondrichthyes Seabirds At its second annual session the Commission recognized the need to take urgent action with respect to mitigating incidental catch of seabirds and the need to cooperate with other organizations in this quest We welcome the comprehensive recommendations from the Scientific Committee and TCC with regard to mitigation measures to be adopted as well as future research and data needs We would urge the Commission to adopt and implement a CMM specific to seabird mitigation at this meeting consistent with the recommendations contained in the Scientific Committee report
WCPFC3-2006-OP03,6,Wider ecosystem issues Like the highly migratory fish stocks with which this Commission is primarily concerned ecosystem considerations and the impacts of fishing on the wider marine ecosystem are also transboundary It is crucial that a collaborative approach is taken to address fishing impacts on the ecosystem particularly on nontarget fish species and that measures to mitigate these impacts are applied in all waters where these occur whether under national jurisdiction or on the high seas In this regard States should ensure compatibility between waters under national jurisdiction and the high seas with respect to measures to mitigate these impacts An aspect of the Scientific Committees future work plan that WWF and TRAFFIC would like to highlight is the work to undertake an Ecological Risk Assessment ERA We welcome this initiative and look forward to the contribution it will make to prioritising species requiring targeted management action noting that this will also facilitate more effective use of the limited resources of the Commission Linked to this we welcome the intention to develop review models to evaluate impacts on the ecosystem including development of reference points identified in the Scientific Committees work programme and would encourage Members to provide funding to support this work With respect to the Regional Observer Programme ROP the ROP is a vital component of fisheries management in the WCPF Convention area The critical role of the ROP is recognized in the Convention text under Part VII Article 28 with further elaboration of its role and functions in Annex III There are obviously certain processes that have to be put in place to ensure that the ROP becomes fully functional however time is of the essence particularly when dealing with a resource base which in the absence of data and without proper management will quickly succumb to overfishing Of particular concern is that the current low observer coverage makes modelling for analyses of species of special interest problematic Therefore WWF and TRAFFIC fully support the recommendations of the Scientific Committee to extend the Regional Observer Programme coverage to ensure representative data collection across the WCPO
WCPFC3-2006-OP03,7,With respect to the ecosystem approach to the WCP fishery WWF and TRAFFIC call for the Scientific Committee to be tasked with identifying sea turtle and sea bird hotspots in the Convention area and associated recommended mitigation actions and targets for consideration by the Commission at the 2007 meeting adoption of a Conservation and Management Measure for mitigating interactions with seabirds at this meeting of the Commission based on the recommendations of the Scientific Committee in line with best practice adoption of a Conservation and Management Measure for sharks based that applies to all species of the Class Chondrichthyes and requires sharks to be landed headed and gutted with skins fins claspers dorsal spines where applicable Members to provide funding for the development review of models to evaluate impacts on the ecosystem including development of reference points identified in the Scientific Committees work programme a fullyfunctioning Regional Observer Programme to be rapidly implemented with coverage that ensures representative data collection across the WCPO particularly with regard to species of special interest
WCPFC3-2006-OP03,8,ALLOCATION OF FISHING OPPORTUNITIES The issue of allocation has been addressed internally among FFA member countries and during the MHLC process where the UNFSA Criteria on Allocation was considered to be a good starting point WWF and TRAFFIC recognize that the paper on allocation prepared for discussion at WCPFC3 is crucial in providing guidance and direction to the members of the Commission We also recognize that in order to be able to deliver on the required conservation outcome namely a stable fishery allocation has to be supported by welldeveloped monitoring control and surveillance measures Where there is noncompliance sanctions will have to be imposed including a reduction in quotas The experience of other RFMOs with regards to allocation demonstrates that it is a necessary component of resource conservation and facilitating responsible fishing This experience also shows common issues such as an inability to agree on an overall catch limit given concomitant limits imposed on national fishing activities lack of willingness to accommodate new members within existing allocation regimes and noncompliance with national allocations In the joint WWFTRAFFIC paper Conservation implications of allocation under the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission tabled at this meeting WWF and TRAFFIC have submitted a number of recommendations first and foremost being that the WCPFC should move rapidly to allocate particularly given that overfishing of two of the four key tuna stocks is already occurring and other RFMOs delays have resulted in a reduced likelihood of agreement in the face of more drastic reductions in catch andor effort WWF and TRAFFIC urge members of the Commission to agree on an allocation criterion taking into account the advice of the Scientific Committee and the requirements under the relevant Articles of the Convention including Article We also urge the Commission to establish a process under which discussions of allocation issues can proceed in a transparent methodical and objective manner
WCPFC3-2006-OP03,9,With respect to allocation of fishing opportunities WWF and TRAFFIC call for the Commission to establish a process under which allocation issues can be progressed in a transparent methodical and objective manner rapid resolution of allocation of fishing opportunities the allocation system developed by the Commission to have inbuilt flexibility and review provisions for example to take account of the aspirations of new members
WCPFC3-2006-OP03,10,OTHER ISSUES Relationship with other organizations As many Members of the Commission are aware negotiations have commenced for a proposed South Pacific RFMO in waters south of the equator covering all nonhighly migratory fish stocks While the proposed new RFMO is likely to exclude the highly migratory fish stocks to which the WCPF Convention applies there will clearly be areas of significant overlap in responsibilities including species of special interest nontarget fish species broader ecosystem issues and measures to address IUU fishing WWF and TRAFFIC have attended each of the two negotiating sessions for the proposed South Pacific RFMO held thus far and was encouraged by the attendance of many of the Members from this Commission and in particular the clear statements made linking the pelagic ecosystems underpinning the WCPF tuna fisheries with the proposed mandate of the new RFMO We would urge the Commission to consider a more formalized approach to and presence at the negotiations for the new South Pacific RFMO to ensure that the best practice standards and aspirations of this Commission are complemented and enhanced under the new Convention
WCPFC3-2006-OP03,11,CONCLUSION The role of the WCPFC is paramount in ensuring that the code of conduct for fishing in the Convention area is observed The effectiveness of the conservation and management measures when they are implemented will only be as effective as the cooperation among its members will allow WWF and TRAFFIC will play our role through a consultative process with national and regional environmental nongovernment organizations in increasing awareness of oceanic fishery resource and ecosystem management enhancing understanding of the WCPFC Convention disseminating relevant information on oceanic fisheries management issues national and regional and promoting awareness of national andor regional development and economic priorities and how they relate to sustainable fisheries management We would like to reiterate that CCMs nonCCMs and Observers have a real opportunity as coastal States fishing States conservationists and industry to cooperate to ensure that responsible fishing is practiced

WCPFC3-2006-OP04,2,Mr Andrew Wright Executive Secretary West and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission PO BOx 2356 Kolonia Pohnpei 96941 Federated States of Micronesia
WCPFC3-2006-OP04,3,Dear Mr Wright You asked recently for comments about the IATTC experience with measures to restrict fishing effort to conserve tuna stocks in the eastern Pacific Ocean I have prepared an outline of the measures adopted by the IATTC since 1966 which may be useful in your preparations for your meeting The IATTC successfully used a closure of the purseseine fishery in the Commissions Yellowfin Regulatory Area CYRA from 1966 to 1979 and subsequently with similar measures during 1998 2001 For a period between 1980 and 1985 it was not possible to reach agreement on the implementation of conservation measures and during 1986 to 1997 conservation measures were not necessary The closure allowed fishing to continue within the CYRA for other species so long as the catch of yellowfin did not exceed 15 of the total The closure of the CRYA for purseseine fishing for yellowfin was a successful measure because 90 of the yellowfin catch was taken by purseseine fishing outside the CYRA caught large yellowfin catches of which had a relatively small impact the stock purseseine fishing that targeted skipjack was not affected by the closure In 1998 the IATTC introduced its first measure to control purseseine catches of bigeye tuna by prohibiting sets on floating objects after 45000 t of bigeye had been taken Resolution C9805 A similar measure was adopted in 1999 Resolution C9906 and provisionally for 2000 Resolution C9909 However there was a very strong recruitment of bigeye in 1998 producing very large catches in which would have lead to the fishery on floating objects being closed in the middle of the year with very serious repercussion of the catches of skipjack Eventually the Commission
WCPFC3-2006-OP04,4,closed the fishery on floating objects from 15 September to 15 December 2000 Resolution C02 During the brief period that management measures had been adopted for bigeye tuna two difficulties arose The first was in determining in advance the appropriate TAC for bigeye This was particularly important because purseseine catches bigeye were taken as a minor catch in sets on floating objects While stopping fishing for bigeye too early may not have been serious from the point of view of catches of bigeye it would have been a more serious issue if skipjack catches were curtailed unnecessarily The objectives of management measures for bigeye tuna and the means of achieving them have varied The initial concern during the 1990s with purseseine catches of bigeye on FADs was that the fishery particularly selected small bigeye tuna The Commission tended to equate purse seine caught bigeye with small or immature bigeye and restrictions were aimed at reducing all purseseine catches However in 2000 the bigeye taken by purseseine vessels were medium sized indicating the fishery could catch a wider range of sizes than hitherto thought In 2001 the bigeye closure was modified to be triggered by the estimated catch of bigeye less than 60cm Resolution C0106 There was also an emerging problem in monitoring sets on floating objects Even with vessels carrying an observer there was a trend for the vessel to make sets including or near floating objects and to claim there were on an unassociated school In addition the use of FADs which were spread throughout the fishery started to produce catches of small bigeye and to a lesser extent yellowfin outside the CYRA A CYRA closure was not effective for bigeye and its rational for yellowfin was weakened As a result of these issues the management measures for purseseine fishing were switched from TAC based measures to measures to limit fishing effort This was particularly convenient in when the recommended reductions in effort for bigeye and yellowfin were comparable and the conservation resolution for 2002 Resolution C0204 simply closed the whole EPO to purseseine fishing during the month of December In 2003 the December closure was limited to an area of the EPO that contained a large part of the fishery in association with FADs shown in figure 1 below Resolution C0312 In a subsequent analysis of the effect of the closed area it was determined that the reduction in catch attributed to the closure was negligible and that overall the closure was ineffective SAR06 2004 Stock Assessment Working Group This was because the closure was both too short and the area was too small allowing the fleet to make good catches of yellowfin and bigeye tuna outside the closed area In 2003 it was also agreed that the fishery in all of the EPO should be closed to purseseining during 1 August to 11 September 2004 The dates for 2004 were chosen as the period in which there would be the greatest reduction of catches of small bigeye compared to the reduction of skipjack catch The time of the year made little difference for yellowfin catches The Resolution also required that the longline catches of bigeye tuna of each CPC be restricted to the level of their catch in 2001 This was the first binding limit on longline catches in the eastern Pacific In fact in 2004 there was a debate about the most appropriate period for a closure and in the event
WCPFC3-2006-OP04,5,two sixweek periods of closure were adopted the second one being from 20 November to 31 December with each CPC being able to adopt one or the other for its fleet An assessment of the effect of the closures in 2004 and 2005 on the number of sets of each type at the 2006 Stock Assessment Review Group SAR712 showed that the there was not a consistent reduction fishing effort in fishing effort in 2004 and 2005 compared to 2003 This was in part due to the growth of the purseseine fleet and also because many vessels scheduled their normal maintenance when they would not have been fishing anyway during the closure period The sixweek closures were applied from 20042006 Resolution C0409 and subsequently extended to 2007 Resolution C0602 The Resolutions also provided specific catch limits for bigeye taken by longline for China Chinese Taipei Japan and Korea and required other CPCs to limit their catches to those of 2001 For 2007 that was changed to the maximum of 500t or their catch in 2001 I hope this assists you in your work of providing advice for your Commission Yours sincerely

WCPFC3-2006-OP05,3,POLICY STATEMENT
WCPFC3-2006-OP05,4,The International Game Fish Association IGFA is a nonprofit organization that represents recreational anglers throughout the world IGFA was established in 1939 and has active members in 123 countries is the governing body for international recreational fishing and provides rules for ethical angling practices Many of IGFAs members target highly migratory species managed by WCPFC
WCPFC3-2006-OP05,5,IGFA has an International Committee of Representatives in nearly 90 countries who have been chosen for their integrity fishing knowledge for sportsmanship and conservation These representatives report to IGFA on issues affecting our interests and are the primary way that IGFA participates in the recreational fishing community
WCPFC3-2006-OP05,6,In addition to compiling decades of catch information from around the world IGFA staff trustees and international representatives participate in international cooperative research and management efforts Presently IGFA represents its members and recreational anglers in general on numerous regional national and international fisheries management panels and also funds and participates in research relating to game fish and their habitats When participating in cooperative research or management IGFAs core purpose is to provide a link and facilitate interaction and information exchange between recreational anglers and fisheries scientists and managers
WCPFC3-2006-OP05,7,IGFA is extremely interested in the progress of the WCPFC and is hopeful that it will be more successful in managing catch effort and stocks than many other international fisheries management organizations
WCPFC3-2006-OP05,8,IGFA requests that the WCPFC management plan takes into consideration the economically and socially important recreational fishery
WCPFC3-2006-OP05,9,IGFA considers that the management plan must also take into consideration the artisanal fishers of the region
WCPFC3-2006-OP05,10,IGFA believes that spatial management should also be taken into consideration
WCPFC3-2006-OP05,11,IGFA would be pleased to consult and advise member states on the economic importance of recreational fishing and its related tourism benefits that it creates

WCPFC4-2007-OP01,7,FOURTH REGULAR SESSION 7 December 2007 Tumon Guam USA OBSERVER STATEMENT GREENPEACE WCPFC42007OP01 th November 2007
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,8,Changing course to safeguard our fisheries and our future Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Fourth Regular Session 37 December 2007 Tumon Guam USA
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,9,December 2007 The Vavau Declarationi issued in October by leaders of the Pacific Forum Island Countries PIF called for regional solidarity among member countries and sought the urgent adoption of additional measures by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC specifically to address overfishing of bigeye and yellowfin tuna The WCPFC must respond to this and to the statements of deep concern at the state of Pacific tuna stocks As a recently appointed observer to the Pacific Islands Forum the WCPFC will be called to account for management of the tuna fisheries in light of Pacific leaders committing to seeking a progress report at their th session
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,10,Greenpeace has in past briefings highlighted the decline and overfishing of the bigeye and yellowfin stocks and problems in addressing IUU activities as examples of ineffective management measures It does not need to be that way This 4th regular session of WCPFC meeting offers an opportunity to change course and adopt strong and binding measures to implement its mandate If we do not do this we are failing in our duty to the Pacific to our countries our citizens and future generations
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,11,In the WCPFC and in other tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisations RFMOs consensus decision making has resulted in lowest common denominator positions allowing countries with the biggest commercial interest in the fisheries to prevent the implementation of measures needed to maintain sustainable fish stocks and profitable fisheries and to preserve the rich marine biodiversity of our oceans The result is overfishing and other environmental impacts We cannot allow this to happen any more
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,12,In order to protect our tuna stocks the Commission must
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,13,2
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,14,Implement a 50 reduction in tuna fishing effort across the entire WCPO sector based on the average of 20012004 levels and to take a precautionary approach and account for unknowns and uncertainties in the data Ban all at sea transhipments with no exemptions granted to any member countries Establish a notake marine reserve for species under the competence of the WCPFC in the enclosed high seas area bounded by Palau FSM PNG and Indonesia as a fisheries management measure set up as part of an ecosystem approach A commitment must also be made to establish fullyprotected no take marine reserves in all high seas donut holes in the near future with clear targets and timelines for implementation Establish a publicly available IUU vessel blacklist Blacklisted vessels must be barred from any future fishing license in the Convention Area Establish 100 observer coverage for the entire Convention Area Adopt a single centralised tamper proof VMS system with real time reporting that is required for all vessels licensed to fish in the WCPFC area including the high seas areas
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,15,Since 2001 regional scientists have been warning that the WCPO stocks of bigeye and yellowfin tuna are under pressure Yet to date no concrete measures have been agreed or implemented to counter the decline of these two stocks Worse the exploitation of bigeye and yellowfin stocks are far higher than the exploitation levels used as inputs to the management models used in these fisheries This is because the high level of unknowns in the data used in scientific modelling and projections is compromised further by the rampant rates of illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing occurring in the region
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,16,In the Vavau Declaration the Pacific Leaders stated their deep concern on the current state of Pacific fisheries and said that for the region there was an imperative need for us to take immediate and decisive collective action to ensure that within the next three to five years we secure our peoples future livelihoods regional food security and environmental sustainability of our seas and their ecosystems They called for a longterm strategic approach to tuna species in the Pacific to ensure that these resources are effectively managed so as to provide longlasting economic social and cultural benefits We must see the directives are followed through We strongly emphasise that the Vavau Declaration requires urgent adoption of additional measures by the WCPFC to address overfishing of bigeye and yellowfin including a reduction in longline catches and addressing purse seine fishing as well as specific steps to reduce the catch of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,17,For a period of seven weeks in 2006 Greenpeace undertook a joint surveillance exercise with the governments of the Federated States of Micronesia and Kiribati With fisheries officers from these States we boarded and inspected fishing vessels inside their respective EEZs Our report ii Plundering the Pacific summarises our findings from the ship tour
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,18,We observed a range of irregular and unreported practices including that 80 of the vessels boarded had Vessel Monitoring System VMS problems and had failed to
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,19,3
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,20,notify the licensing coastal state that they were fishing inside their waters or send catch reports It was not uncommon for this joint enforcement taskforce to inspect ships that had less than 200 tons of tuna on board when they had been at sea for over a yeara strong indication that transhipment at sea is extensive One vessel was boarded which had been at sea for up to two years without submitting any verifiable records on the actual tonnage of tuna harvested during this period
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,21,This evidence provides us with firsthand experience of the extent of the problems of IUU fishing atsea It also points to certain management loopholes that still exist and need to be urgently addressed Recently Greenpeace has also observed numerous nonCommission member vessels still operating in the Convention area In particular vessels flagged to Panama and some Latin American countries are still operating both with and without licences Where they have been issued with licences they should not have been Vessels continue plundering the WCPO area because of the weak management framework and the availability of ports of convenience The Commission will be called upon to be serious and fair in dealing with these
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,22,Keeping Pacific Solidarity firmly on the Agenda
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,23,Agenda Item 4 Science Issues The Greenpeace briefing paperiii to the third regular session of the Scientific Committee meeting of the Commission in Honolulu outlined our grave concern regarding the status of the tuna stocks specifically the constant decline in the bigeye and yellowfin stocks and the use of the now discredited concept of maximum sustainable yield MSY
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,24,Reports from Science Committee meetings SC1 SC2 and SC3 have been increasingly more pessimistic
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,25,SC3 this year concluded that the WCPO yellowfin tuna fishery can be considered to be fully exploited that both the 2006 and 2007 assessments indicate that there is a high probability that overfishing of yellowfin is occurring and that reductions in the fishing mortality rate are required to maintain average biomass at levels greater than above BMSY iv
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,26,In 2006 SC2 found that models indicated that there is a high probability that overfishing of bigeye has been occurring in the WCPOv
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,27,While SC1 in 2005 the SC assessed that overfishing is likely occurring and that reduction of fishing mortality is neededvi SC1 noted that the assessment moved from overfishing was possibly occurring in 2004 to likely occurring in 2005vii
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,28,The question must therefore be asked if reductions are required how can we fail to make those reductions
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,29,We also note the uncertainties in light of IUU fishing Recent media reports of southern bluefin tuna from Australia illegally caught by Japanese fishers totalling billions of dollars serve as a warning Reported methods that were used to hide the overcatch include evasion of onshore inspections underreporting of amounts caught and importation as different tuna species either transshipped at sea from foreign vessels or in containersviii Given these uncertainties and indeterminacies the measures proposed to address this unsustainable fishery fall far short of what is necessary to assure that the current situation is checked and reversed The 2006
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,30,4
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,31,SC2ix recommendations in fishing of 25 for bigeye and 10 for yellowfin tuna not only have not been acted upon but are far below the reductions required in the application of a precautionary management regime The scientific work of fisheries organisations should be moving towards ecosystem based fisheries management
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,32,The Greenpeace Science report to the second regular session of the Scientific Committee in Manilla in 2006 outlined the scientific basis of the catch and effort measures needed to salvage the overfished bigeye and yellowfin stocks We must take account of and act on the high levels of uncertainties and indeterminacy History shows that this is fundamental to ensuring that overfishing does not occur
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,33,Greenpeace therefore continues to press that the precautionary approach must be applied by way of a 50 reduction in tuna fishing effort across the entire WCPO sector
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,34,Pacific Leaders themselves have directed the urgent adoption of additional measures by the WCPFC to address overfishing of bigeye and yellowfin including a reduction in longline catches and addressing purse seine fishing and specific steps to reduce the catch of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin given that the leaders were seized by the scientific advice that overfishing of two key regional tuna species bigeye and yellowfin tuna now places stock levels in jeopardyx
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,35,1 Agenda Item 6 Technical and Compliance Issues The Greenpeace briefing paper3 to the third regular session of the Technical and Compliance Committee TCC of the Commission in Pohnpei FSM made recommendations on the proper functioning and implementation of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs of the Commission
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,36,On technical and compliance issues Greenpeace recommends that the Commission
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,37,Ban all at sea transhipments with no exemptions granted to any member countries Establish 100 observer coverage for the entire Convention Area Urgently adopt a single centralised tamper proof VMS system with real time reporting that is required for all vessels licensed to fish in the WCPFC area including the high seas areas Immediately establish the Commission Fishing Vessel Registry as a matter of priority with no extensions given to member countries that have yet to submit their vessel details Establish a publicly available IUU vessel blacklist Blacklisted vessels must be barred from any future fishing license in the Convention Area Adopt a Port State Scheme that enables coastal states to exercise effective control over fishing vessels in their ports regardless of whether the vessel is licensed to fish in their EEZ Establish an electronic catch and trade verification scheme Establish stringent boarding and inspection rules and sanctions for vessels found violating Commission rules
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,38,5
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,39,2 Agenda Item 8 Conservation and Management Measures Greenpeace proposes refinements to the following Conservation and Management Measuresxi
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,40,Record of Fishing Vessels and Authorization to Fish CMM200401 This measure is an important measure to combat IUU fishing in the Pacific and should be supported The Secretariats Information paperxii addresses this resolution in paragraphs 1123
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,41,CMM 200401 establishes a record of fishing vessels and authorizations to fish Paragraph A1c requires CCMs Members Cooperating NonMembers and Participating Territories to ensure that fishing for tuna in the Convention Area is conducted only by vessels flying the flag of a member of the Commission What this means is that vessels that are flagged to countries that are not CCMs cannot be licensed by CCMsxiii Vessels flagged to nonCCMs or CNMs Cooperating Non Members which operate vessels in the Convention area may be IUUxiv The Commission addressed the issue of nonCCM flagged vessels by establishing a temporary register of carriers and bunkers It is clear that if a vessel is not on the temporary register of carriers and bunkers or added to the temporary register then it would be in breach of CMM20041
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,42,This measure also means that Pacific Islands States should no longer be licensing these nonCCM flagged vessels
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,43,Greenpeace therefore draws this to the attention of CCMs and calls on all CCMS to cease to issue licences to nonCCM flagged vessels which do not have a temporary exemption
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,44,Greenpeace opposes transshipment at sea for the reasons given above Greenpeace also opposes bunkering at sea for similar reasons Bunkering at sea allows IUU vessels to stay at sea longer and facilitates illicit transshipment and other evasion of port state controls
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,45,Conservation and Management Measures for Bigeye and Yellowfin Tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean CMM200501 and CMM200601 CMM 200601 recognises that the Scientific Community has recommended reductions in fishing but does not follow up the recommendation with action Focusing on FADs and juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna is nowhere near enough to protect the stocks This must be addressed in Guam We recommend a new measure to require proportionate reductions not at 2001 or averaged 20014 levels but at half those levels taking into account the deep concern expressed in the Vavau Declaration and for the reasons discussed in this briefing paper
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,46,As far as FADs floating platforms that seine fleets place on the ocean surface and to which tuna are instinctively drawn go the draft measure proposed by FFA Members does not go far enough The proposed FAD closure is welcome but the closure should be permanent In targeting skipjack schooling under FADs seiners also catch large amounts of immature bigeye and yellowfin who school together with skipjack as well as indiscriminately scoop up other associated marine life such as sharks and unwanted fish species
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,47,The volume of this bycatch is significant given the smaller size and vulnerability of the bigeye and yellowfin stocks The lowvaluehigh volume skipjack fishery
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,48,6
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,49,therefore is undermining the more valuable vulnerable and less resilient bigeye and yellowfin stocks as well as due to the fleet overcapacity and increased efficiency of catching tuna is putting the longterm sustainability of the entire fishery in jeopardy Based on these concerns and the urgent need to reduce the global tuna catches Greenpeace believes that the use of FADs for industrial tuna fisheries should be universally and urgently banned
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,50,Conservation and Management Measure Commission Vessel Monitoring System CMM200606 We noted in our report on our Pacific tour that 80 of the vessels boarded had VMS problems and had failed to notify the licensing coastal state that they were fishing inside their waters or send catch reports This shows that it is critical to get the VMS system right and to address the inevitable attempts to evade it Licences must be revoked where vessels are found to have turned off or otherwise tampered with VMS systems and such vessels placed on the IUU list established under CMM200609
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,51,New measures other conservation requirements and procedural matters Among considerations that the Commission is due to discuss Greenpeace would like to comment on the following measures
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,52,Transhipments The draft Conservation and Management Measure on Transhipment proposed by the Republic of the Marshall Islands WCPFC42008DP08 paragraph 1 proposes the ban of all transshipment operations of highly migratory fish stocks covered by the Convention at sea or on the high seas should be supported by CCMs However Greenpeace does not support exempting any transshipment within the waters under the national jurisdiction of a CCM We believe that such an exemption would render the measure open to abuse and evasion
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,53,There are obvious advantages for Pacific Island Countries in banning transhipment It strengthens the traceability of fish caught encourages the landing of fish and its subsequent reporting It can contribute to the development of fishing industries which Pacific Leaders have affirmed as importantxv The banning of transshipments also increases compliance with measures and helps to reduce IUU fishing
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,54,Observers Greenpeace wishes to record its dismay at the TCC3 Summary Reportxvi The failure to commit to even 20 observer coverage shows a low level of commitment to sustainability A 5 coverage rate is merely token As noted by a recent reportxvii partial coverage defined as the usual 2030 coverage may run into problems with bias arising especially from changes in vessel behavior or the inability to cover all sectors of a fleet equally and is therefore inadequate for compliance monitoring coverage such as is implemented in CCAMLR and NAFO is required for compliance monitoring and provides better data Even so true 100 coverage requires more than 1 observer per vessel one observer may only monitor 3070 of all haulsxviii Unwillingness to commit to observer coverage is inconsistent to a commitment to sustainability and should be reflected in allocation decisions
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,55,Allocation It is time for the Pacific Islands to progress frank discussions about allocation The overfishing of two important stocks is already occurring and significant reductions in catch or effort will make allocation more difficult Allocation can only work if PICs cooperate
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,56,7
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,57,The mechanism for allocation must be one that serves conservation as well as sustainable use allocation rights must be and are subordinate to the obligation to conserve xix However there is little incentive for conservation and resources are depleted without equitable allocation of rights
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,58,Going hand in hand with the allocation issue are access agreements and rights It is critical that access agreements are negotiated multilaterally so that sustainability which is the focus of WCPFC FFA and other regional fora are not compromised by access agreementsxx
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,59,Mandatory cohesion of measures The addressing of IUU fishing is critical to both the enabling of an accurate Total Allowable Catch TAC to be set and the avoidance of noncompliance with allocations
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,60,When integrated with related measures such as of observers VMS and other MCSCE monitoring control surveillance compliance and enforcement prerequisites they all have an impact on the allocation process which gives further rise to equitable sustainable and a robust Pacific fishery
WCPFC4-2007-OP01,61,NoTake Marine Reserves Forum Island Country Leaders had in October also committed to the protection of high seas biodiversity and the conservation and management of nonhighly migratory fish stocks in the Pacific Oceanxxi Notake marine reserves in the high seas enclaves that prevents the take of species covered by the WCPFC would be an important step towards achieving a fully protected marine reserves in the high seas pockets which can allow our ecosystems to breed and breathe

WCPFC4-2007-OP01,88,xxi Vavau Declaration
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,1,WWFTRAFFIC POSITION STATEMENT TO WCPFC4
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,2,INTRODUCTION Recognizing that the WCPFC is now in its fourth year of existence WWF and TRAFFIC believe that the time for action is now in collectively agreeing to and implementing conservation and management measures for the sustainable exploitation of the Pacifics tuna resources The concern over the decline in some of our important tuna species is not fully reflected in the management of fishing behavior We recognize that there are severe limitations to the capacity of many CCMs however we must also recognize that our inaction will make a mockery of our ability to take firm decisions and implement them when they matter most The level of actions undertaken by the Commission over the last 4 years does not reflect the seriousness of the declining tuna stocks
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,3,WWF and TRAFFIC acknowledge the outcomes relating to sustainable tuna management arising out of meetings prior to WCPFC4 They include among others the 38th Pacific Islands Forum Nukualofa Tonga Oct 2007 the WCPFC secretariat contribution to the Joint Meeting of Tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations Kobe Japan Jan 2007 Forum Fisheries Committee meeting Wellington New Zealand May 2007 and the meetings of the subsidiary committees of the WCPFC
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,4,WWF and TRAFFIC urge the Commission to heed the advice of the Scientific Committee SC and the Technical Compliance Committee TCC and undertake the following actions
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,5,REDUCTION OF FISHING MORTALITY WWF and TRAFFIC reiterate their support for the 2005 recommendation by the Scientific Committee that a reduction in fishing mortality of 39 is required to maintain the Bigeye tuna biomass at a level 20 above MSY and a 26 reduction in fishing mortality on Yellowfin tuna is required to maintain biomass at 20 above MSY
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,6,CATCH DOCUMENTATION SCHEME CDS WWF and TRAFFIC fully support the implementation of a Catch Documentation Scheme as a key priority for the WCPFC We note the Report of the Joint Tuna RFMO Technical Working Group on Trade and Documentation which recommended that all tuna RFMOs adopt CDS schemes A CDS is a transparent mechanism to track fish caught with a wide range of gears and practices from vessel to plate providing a verification procedure on a near real time basis We believe that a CDS measure will go a long way to combat IUU fishing WCPFC42007OP04 Observer Statement WWFTraffic
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,7,TRANSSHIPMENT MONITORING WWF and TRAFFIC support a ban on highseas transshipment as a measure to combat IUU fishing We support inport transshipment provided all transshipments are subject to observer coverage and take place in designated ports We urge the Commission to develop its transshipment guidelines and encourage CCMs to work with the Commission on this issue
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,8,FISH AGGREGATION DEVICES FADs WWF and TRAFFIC are concerned about significant bycatch of juvenile Bigeye and Yellowfin tuna particularly by purse seine and pole and line vessels WWF and TRAFFIC call for collaborative research to focus on the following solutions to FAD closures such as time area management strategies for FAD use identifying hotspots of juvenile Bigeye and Yellowfin tunas determining a regime for observer coverage and reporting and encouraging the use of best scientific advice in the management of FADs
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,9,ILLEGAL UNREPORTED UNREGULATED IUU FISHING The threat of IUU fishing looms particularly large in this area In this context WWF and TRAFFIC are concerned that fishing vessels continue to contravene agreements made by this Commission and its members
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,10,WWF and TRAFFIC call on the WPCFC to implement robust sanctions against fishing vessels support vessels CCMs or cooperating nonmember states that contravene any management measure In fact a full set of penalties agreed to by the members of the Commission must be put in place
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,11,REGIONAL OBSERVER PROGRAMME ROP WWF and TRAFFIC recognize the challenges in implementing an effective and functional ROP fully aware of the responsibilities of both the regional observers and vessel operators as specified under Article 28 and Article 3 of Annex III of the Convention While the Commission is unlikely to agree to 100 observer coverage which would be ideal the Commission should nonetheless aim for coverage well above the 5 minimum initial level We consider the 5 minimum initial level inadequate given the size of the Convention Area and the potential ecosystem impacts of fishing activities WWF and TRAFFIC encourage a close collaborative effort between the SC and TCC recognizing that the role of the regional observer cuts across the tasks of both committees
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,12,ALLOCATION WWF and TRAFFIC tabled a paper at WCPFC3 titled Conservation implications of allocation under the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission We reiterate our stand with respect to allocation of fishing opportunities calling for a the Commission to establish a process under which allocation issues can be progressed in a transparent methodical and objective manner b rapid resolution of allocation of fishing opportunities c the allocation system developed by the Commission to have inbuilt flexibility and review provisions for example to take account of the aspirations of new members
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,13,WCPFC42007OP04 Observer Statement WWFTraffic
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,14,BYCATCH MITIGATION
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,15,Sea Turtles WWF and TRAFFIC recognize that sea turtle bycatch in longline fishing operations continues to be a problem in the Western and Central Pacific Already a range of progressive measures have been introduced globally including the use of circle hooks in place of jhooks
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,16,WWF and TRAFFIC further recognize that while trials and experiments on the use of circle hooks to reduce turtle bycatch have been and are being undertaken around the world the use of circle hooks as a turtle mitigation measure in the WCPFC area may be undermined by their impact on sharks While insufficient data exists on the bycatch levels in the Western and Central Pacific WWF and TRAFFIC urge the Commission to undertake precautionary measures in the absence of such data
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,17,In addition we urge that all member countries undertake research to determine the level of turtle bycatch in their fleets within one year and undertake within three years a program of trials with modified fishing gear andor techniques to evaluate their effectiveness with respect to bycatch of turtles and catch rates of target species and report back regarding data activities and results to the SC and TCC
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,18,Sharks WWF and TRAFFIC welcome the fact that the WCPFC have adopted a conservation and management measure that will become binding as of 1 January 2008 We are deeply concerned that the CMM on sharks exempts vessels under 24m which represents an enormous number of vessels and catch of sharks This exemption makes the CMM adopted by the WCPFC the weakest of all shark measures adopted by any of the tuna RFMOs and hence WWF and TRAFFIC wish to see the exemption deleted at this meeting Secondly we wish to see a quantitative demonstration that the shark catches that result after 1 January 2008 represent catches at sustainable levels
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,19,Seabirds WWF and TRAFFIC were concerned at the outcomes of the seabird discussion at WCPFC3 2006 We believe that the seabird bycatch mitigation specifications should be minimum standards not mere guidelines
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,20,The outcomes of SC3 and TCC3 have shown that the following needs to be undertaken collaborative research must be encouraged on specifications that are not fully understood by CCMs information and data sharing among CCMs stop using guidelines and specifications as negotiating tools either to buy time or to stall progress in agreeing to specific measures fishers must be clearly informed regarding operation of the specification of seabird mitigation measures
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,21,WCPFC42007OP04 Observer Statement WWFTraffic
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,22,CONCLUSION History is already repeating itself in the WCPO As tuna populations in other parts of the world are depleted fishing fleets are moving to the WCPO and are overfishing now This Commission must be prepared to take the hard decisions to prevent fisheries collapse now
WCPFC4-2007-OP04,23,Although the WCPFC is still young relative to other RFMOs WWF and TRAFFIC are of the view that some CCMs in the WCPFC have come in rich with experience and have the benefit of hindsight because of their involvement in other RFMOs With the WCPO considered to be the last frontier for tuna the decisions on CMMs for the WCPFC are critical Lessons from other RFMOs must be learnt WCPFC42007OP04 Observer Statement WWFTraffic
WCPFC4-2007-OP10,1,FOURTH REGULAR SESSION 7 December 2007 Tumon Guam USA OPENING STATEMENT AMERICAN FISHERMENS RESEARCH FOUNDATION WCPFC42007OP10 December 2007
WCPFC4-2007-OP10,2,The American Fishermens Research Foundation AFRF is grateful to the Commission for its permission to attend this important meeting as an ENGO Observer It is an honor for our organization to be so recognized after the many years we have participated first in the development of the South Pacific albacore troll fishery along with the cooperation of the Western Fishboat Owners Association WFOA and then later through the MHLC process the deliberations of the PrepCon and the first three meetings of the Commission
WCPFC4-2007-OP10,3,Established in 1971 AFRF is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to encourage promote and support scientific research and public education concerning albacore tuna and related species It is a unique fisheries research foundation funded entirely by albacore troll fishermen primarily from the United States Canada and New Zealand by self assessment of their catch delivered to AFRF contracted buyers sold directly to consumers by individual vessels and purveyed in value added markets AFRFs support for scientific research efforts to further public education and involvement with other projects benefit all pole and line albacore fishermen in the North and South Pacific from whichever country they call home
WCPFC4-2007-OP10,4,AFRFs Board of Directors is composed of half albacore processor and buyer representatives and half WFOA fishermen representatives AFRF has independent science advisors attend its Board meetings as well as representatives from NOAAFisheries and academia A partial list of past and current projects is set forth in the AFRF pamphlets to be made available in the lobby1
WCPFC4-2007-OP10,5,AFRF continues to support the international management of albacore tuna in a sustainable manner based on the best scientific data available It believes that albacore resources which visit various countries EEZs should be managed so national measures are consistent and compatible with internationally agreed measures for the high seas area where this species spends the majority of its life AFRF looks forward to working cooperatively with all coastal and distant water fishing states to ensure the sustainability and utilization of this wonderful resource upon which we all depend for good tasting healthy nutritious and economic protein Additional information is available at httpwwwafrforg and httpwwwalbatunacom
WCPFC4-2007-OP12,1,FOURTH REGULAR SESSION 7 December 2007 Tumon Guam USA
WCPFC4-2007-OP12,2,WTPO MEMBERS FISHING IN THE WESTERN AND CENTRAL PACIFIC OCEAN REQUEST TO WCPFC WCPFC42007OP12
WCPFC4-2007-OP12,3,WTPO 7th Annual Meeting Tokyo Japan 11 July 2007
WCPFC4-2007-OP12,4,WTPO Members fishing in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean request to WCPFC
WCPFC4-2007-OP12,5,In light of the recommendations of the Scientific Committee to reduce the fishing mortality of bigeye tuna by 25 and of yellowfin tuna by 10 in order to achieve the proportional fishing mortality reduction for the purse seine fishery WTPO propose that WCPFC could establish a time and area closure on FADs fishing by all purse seine vessels in areas and during the time where more juvenile bigeye and yellowfin concentrate as best way of reducing juvenile tuna mortality
WCPFC4-2007-OP12,6,Having in mind the application of Conservation and Management Measure 06 on VMS control of this timearea closure on FAD fishing will be carried out through VMS control for all the vessels to avoid entering the identified areas Any vessel that wants to get inside the closed area shall be regulated through an observer scheme to insure that fishing other than FADs fishing is conducted in the closed area
WCPFC4-2007-OP12,7,That necessary measure is undertaken so that the affected coastal country or countries will not be disproportionately burdened by such time and area closure
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,1,FOURTH REGULAR SESSION Tumon Guam 7 December 2007 STATEMENT BY OCEANA WCPFC42007OP16 December 2007
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,2,Oceana is an international organisation dedicated to the study and protection of the worlds oceans Since 2006 Oceana has been engaged in a major European programme to investigate shark fisheries with the objective of restoring and conserving shark populations through improved European Union EU fisheries policy The data and photos Oceana gathered during its investigative activities reveal the scope of European Union fishing fleets operating worldwide and in the Western and Central Pacific WCPO
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,3,European fisheries have traditionally exploited many small seafloorliving coastal sharks and skates and have recently increased their exploitation of deepwater sharks The largest European shark fisheries undertaken by pelagic Spanish and Portuguese fleets on the high seas of the Atlantic Pacific and Indian Oceans are very poorly documented Though these fisheries historically targeted tunas and swordfish longline catches of oceanic sharks are as high as or higher than the catch of targeted species suggesting that EU surface longliners now target sharks
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,4,Recently 96 EU fishing vessels have been authorized for access and fishing rights in the WCPO Because of Europes influence on global fisheries and the importance of sharks in ocean ecosystems we would like to share information with the WCPFC members regarding the trade of shark fins in Papeete French Polynesia by Spanish vessels and the IUU fishing of two Spanish longline vessels
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,5,Details about these cases can be found in a report Oceana published today The report entitled Fishy Business reveals how European Union fleets in particular some from Spain escape EU regulations by catching sharks in targeted but unmanaged fisheries all around the world The report can be downloaded at httpwwwoceanaorgeuropepublicationsreports
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,6,Additionally we would like to share further information regarding other European Union shark fisheries operating around the world We hope this information will be of your interest and helpful in strengthening global shark conservation
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,7,Forbidden trade of shark fins by two Spanish longliners in the harbour of Papeete and IUU fishing of European Union vessels
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,8,A fleet of at least 17 Spanish longliners are operating out of the harbour of Papeete According to a French Polynesian decree1 from April 2006 the trade sale or purchase of any part of a shark in French Polynesia is prohibited except that for shortfin mako sharks fishing for sharks and retention on board of all or part of the animal is forbidden whatever the intended end use However the mako shark is exempt from this rule Accidental catches of those species where catches and retention on board is not allowed must be immediately discarded
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,9,In its report entitled Fishy Business Oceana reveals activities carried out by a Spanish longliner in the harbour of Papeete that compromise this regulation The pictures published in the report show the Nuevo Josmaru a 43metre long modern industrial fishing vessel that is part of the Spanish surface longliner fleet in the harbour of Papeete The pictures show the Nuevo Josmaru unloading frozen shark fins onto a small truck and that local workers later unload them from the truck into a container most likely to be shipped to Asia The Nuevo Josmaru is a rather new vessel constructed in 2000 with European Community aid its homeport is Vigo in Galicia Spain
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,10,Two other vessels using Papeetes harbour to land their catches the Nuevo Pleamar and the Mariane are not permitted to fish in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean These two vessels are not included on the record of authorized fishing vessels for the WCPF convention area However harbour information reveals that the Nuevo Pleamar and the Mariane called into the harbour of Papeete as recently as November 2007 According to the FAO definition these vessels are carrying out IUU fishing General description of the EU fishing vessels and their related fisheries on the WCPFC White List
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,11,The recently published WCPFC record of authorized vessels includes 96 EU fishing vessels 48 longliners 33 purse seiners 12 gillnetters 2 trawlers and 1 troll vessel and 5 transport vessels that have access and fishing rights in the WCPO
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,12,The WCPFC grants fishing rights essentially for the catch of tuna and swordfish species However more than 50 of the authorized EU vessels are actually involved in shark fisheries and target pelagic or deepwater sharks
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,13,Due to the scarcity of tunas and swordfish species European Union longline vessels have been using those species quotas to target sharks in the worlds oceans and as a result pelagic shark fisheries have boomed in recent decades Shark fins are among the most expensive seafood products in the world and are exported to Asia for the preparation of shark fin soup The European Union is the second largest elasmobranch fishing state in the world with targeted shark fisheries operated by more than 200 modern surface longliners and is also one of the largest shark fin traders in the world European Union fleets reported 13 of global elasmobranch landings to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO in 2005 Today Spain is the centre of the shark fin trade in Europe and is one of the biggest exporters worldwide of shark fins to Asian markets
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,14,Furthermore the stocks of some European deepsea shark species have massively declined due to the fishing activities of powerful fishing fleets and scientists of the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas ICES have recommended a zero Total Allowable Catch TAC for these species2 Deepsea shark fisheries and particularly deepsea gillnet fisheries were not managed before 2006 These vulnerable species were caught in great amounts so that their liver oil could be used in the cosmetics industry producing a serious threat to their conservation
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,15,The necessity of efficient National Plans of Action for Sharks
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,16,During the WCPFC third regular session conservation and management measures were implemented for sharks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean One of the decisions was that Commission Members Cooperating nonMembers and participating Territories shall implement the Arrete n 396 CM du 28 avril 2006 portant inscription des requins sur la liste des espces protges de la catgorie B et modifiant le code de lenvironnement de la Polynsie franaise ICES Advisory Committee on Fisheries Management ICES CM 2006ACFM31 Ref LRCReport of the Working Group on Elasmobranch Fishes WGEF FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks National Plans of Action or other relevant policies for sharks shall include measures to minimize waste and discards from shark catches and encourage the live release of incidental shark catches This conservation and management measure is binding as of 1 January 2008
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,17,Since 1999 scientific warnings of shark depletion have only intensified The World Conservation Union IUCN now considers 20 of the worlds cartilaginous fishes assessed to be Threatened with extinction The situation is even worse in Europe where a full third of these species are classified as Threatened and no Shark Plan of Action exists Targeted species such as the spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias the porbeagle shark Lamna nasus and several deepwater sharks have been overfished to the point where they are now considered Critically Endangered in this region
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,18,A recent scientific paper presented to the Scientific Committee WCPFCSC3EB SWGIP19 stated that only three of the shark species reported to be caught in the WCPO are categorized by the IUCN as Vulnerable However Oceana highlights the fact that in February 2007 expert findings of the Shark Specialist group of the IUCN revealed that this number is much higher Even the widest ranging sharks are threatened by overfishing and more species are being added to the 2008 IUCN Red List See table below

WCPFC4-2007-OP16,38,Oceana recommends that the WCPFC prohibit access for all EU vessels targeting sharks until a Community Plan of Action for Sharks is implemented with the required measures to protect endangered species manage commercialized species reduce unwanted shark bycatch eliminate shark discards and close any loopholes permitting the illegal practice of finning to occur Targeted shark fisheries of Spanish and Portuguese surface longliners
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,39,On the list of European Union vessels that have been granted access to the WCPFC area 36 Spanish and 3 Portuguese surface longliners are included The longline fishery is renowned to target sharks and swordfish in the Atlantic Indian and Pacific Oceans
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,40,The main species taken by the Spanish and Portuguese surface longline fleet in the Atlantic are blue shark Prionace glauca swordfish Xiphias gladius mako sharks Isurus spp thresher sharks Alopias spp and hammerhead sharks Sphyrna spp Due to uncontrolled fisheries and bycatches thresher and mako sharks are considered globally Vulnerable by IUCN Red List criteria and the scalloped hammerhead shark is considered Endangered Furthermore annual mako shark catches were estimated at 5301 metric tons in 2005 in the WCPO WCPFCSC3ST SWGIP2 The blue shark the worlds most abundant and heavily fished pelagic shark is considered Near Threatened Scientists have noted declines of 5070 per cent of this species in the North Atlantic
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,41,As in the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans the Spanish longline fleet operating in the Pacific since 1990 has targeted swordfish and sharks In 2005 Spanish longliners operating in the WCPFC area reported a total catch of 12264 metric tons of swordfish and 16037 metric tons of sharks and in the last four years shark catches have been much more significant than swordfish catches

WCPFC4-2007-OP16,43,The deepsea gillnet fishery targeted deepsea shark catches
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,44,On the list of the 96 European Union fishing vessels that have been granted access to the WCPFC area there are 11 UK and 4 Portuguese flagged vessels employing deepsea gillnets although most of the boats belong to Spanish companies and operated out of Galician ports Among other species these vessels targeted deepsea sharks in a deepsea gillnet fishery in the North East Atlantic Ocean NEAT
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,45,The unregulated use of gillnets in deep water is potentially damaging to deepsea stocks due to excessive soak times and consequent high discard levels and due to the longterm impact of lost or abandoned gear common in this type of fishery
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,46,Before temporary management measures came into force in 2006 the vessels involved in the NEAT deepsea gillnet fishery deployed more than 6000 kilometres of fixed gillnets rasco or anglerfish nets every day to catch hake anglerfish king crab and deepsea sharks The catches of deepsea sharks by these fleets particularly Portuguese dogfish Centroscymnus coelolepis and leafscale gulper sharks Centrophorus squamosus have contributed to the depletion of these stocks which are currently on the verge of collapse These vessels catches were neither controlled nor fully reported
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,47,The poor selectivity of these nets together with the amount of time they are left in the water the huge amount of nets makes it difficult for fishermen to bring them all in at one time and the time that some of the nets consequently remain in the water can exceed several weeks means that many of the specimens caught are rotten or in a damaged state when brought in This has meant for example that up to 71 of the monkfish Lophius spp catch had to be discarded
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,48,Another problem of these deepsea gillnet vessels is the frequent discard or loss of their fishing nets An investigation by fisheries scientists published in the Deepnetreport5 of 2005 found The amount of fishing gear used in the fisheries the lengths of the fleets and the fact that the nets are unattended much of the time make it very likely that a large quantity of nets are lost while there is also evidence of illegal dumping of sheet netting The vessels are not capable of carrying their nets back to port and only the headline and footropes are brought ashore while the net sheets are discarded either bagged on board burnt or dumped at sea The total amount of loss and discarding of nets is not known although anecdotal evidence suggests up to 30kms of gear are routinely discarded per vessel per trip
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,49,Due to the wasteful and destructive fishing practices of these vessels the EU temporarily closed the NEAT deepwater gillnet fishery in December 2005 The temporary closure which took effect on 1 February 2006 encompassed waters deeper than 200 metres to the north and west of Great Britain and Ireland In January 2007 the deepsea gillnet fishery was partly reopened with temporary measures restricting depth limit maximum length and maximum soak time The deepsea shark fishery which generally operated below 1000 metres depth was effectively closed due to the established maximum depth limit of 600 metres

WCPFC4-2007-OP16,51,Shark bycatch on European Union purse seiners
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,52,A total of 33 European Union purse seiners 20 French and 13 Spanish vessels are included on the list of authorized vessels of the WCPFC Shark bycatch in purse seine fisheries is usually high and the main species observed taken in this fishery are the hammerhead shark Sphyrna spp silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis and oceanic white tip shark Carcharhinus longimanus
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,53,Several studies carried out on board French and Spanish purse seiners in the Atlantic Ocean have shown significant shark bycatch rates varying from 02 to 15 of total catches6 Moreover a recent assessment of shark bycatch in the tuna purse seine fishery of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean WCPFCSC3EB SWGIP3 shows that during purseseine sets associated with floating objects on tunas in the eastern Pacific Ocean high amounts of shark bycatch occur Silky sharks are particularly associated with purse seine sets in the eastern Pacific Ocean

WCPFC4-2007-OP16,55,While shark bycatch rates in the European Union purse seine fishery may appear low they represent a significant amount for those threatened species
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,56,Landing sharks with fins attached an efficient and proven measure to avoid finning
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,57,In October 2006 an expert workshop7 focused on the European Union shark finning prohibition unanimously recommended the fins attached approach as the best means of preventing the illegal practice of finning removing a sharks fins and discarding the body at sea Requiring fins to be landed still attached to shark carcasses is a successful and efficient policy to prevent finning and one that is already practiced by industrial shark fishing fleets in Costa Rica El Salvadors finning regulation requires that fins remain attached to the carcass by at least 25 of their base
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,58,In fact only a fins attached policy would prevent highgrading the practice of mixing bodies and fins from different species on board and improve information on species and catches Until a fins attached policy is adopted it is imperative that the current 5 fintocarcass ratio is not increased Indeed it should be immediately clarified that the current ratio serves as a maximum and applies to the dressed weight of sharks beheaded and gutted not the whole weight The current ratio applied in the European Union is 5 of the whole weight which according to the IUCN permits a proportion of sharks caught to be finned and discarded8
WCPFC4-2007-OP16,59,In addition the transhipment of shark fins should be forbidden and shark bodies and fins should be landed together in the same port Finally a recent study reviewing the current fin to carcass ratio WCPFCSC3EB SWGWP4 also concludes that in the absence of a clear and scientifically robust fin to carcass weight ratio an alternative approach to reducing wastage and shark finning is to prohibit the removal of fins from the carcass prior to landing

WCPFC5-2008-OP01,7,INTRODUCTION A record catch of tuna was reported in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC Convention Area in 20071 Alarmingly this increase in tuna catch comes against a backdrop of equally alarming global trends such as 76 of the worlds commercially harvested fish stocks already being fully exploited over exploited or recovering from depletion 2 The Pacific tuna stocks are showing signs of following these overexploitation trends with overfishing occurring on both bigeye and yellowfin stocks Despite repeated warnings from the Scientific Committee on the status of these stocks the 2007 catches of yellowfin tuna were higher than the average level for the past 10 years 3 and the provisional bigeye tuna catch was the second highest on record 4 Distant water fishing vessels are also increasingly migrating to the region and unsustainably exploiting the ocean resources undermining avoiding and evading the management and conservation measures that have been managed to put into place
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,8,This years Commission meeting is critical The WCPFC must turn itself around this year and agree strong and effective measures to maintain a sustainable and profitable fishery by adopting Overview of Tuna Fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean including Economic Conditions 2007 WcpfcSc42008Gn Wp1 Paper Prepared By Peter Williams and Peter Terawasi At httpwwwwcpfcintsc4pdfSC4GNWP120finalpdf FAO 2007 Williams and Terawasi Ibid Greenpeace Briefing to WCPFC5 Page 2 a precautionary and ecosystem based approach to preserve the vast marine diversity of the Pacific Ocean In particular the agreement on effective bigeye and yellowfin tuna conservation and management measures will be a key test to showing whether WCPFC members are serious in fulfilling the objective to ensure through effective management the longterm conservation and sustainable use of highly migratory fish stocks in the western and central Pacific Ocean5 Failure to do so will mean that the WCPFC has yet again followed the footsteps of other failed or failing Regional Fisheries Management Organisations RFMOs such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ICCAT now seen as an international disgrace to fisheries management6 The WCPFC shares many member States with ICCAT and clearly has a lot of work to do to avoid a similar fate and reputation in the Pacific region
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,9,Stalling tactics by certain distant water fishing nations DWFNs and other difficulties in reaching consensus within the WCPFC have led to a very nonproductive and damaging process and lack of progress where key conservation and management measures are not agreed As a result this has led to dissatisfaction by a number of members in particular Pacific Island countries PICs who believe that the interests of the majority of the members including the resource owners have not been reflected in meeting outcomes Whilst consensusbased decisionmaking is the first aim under the Convention which is only until all efforts to reach a decision by consensus have been exhausted7 and there are provisions in the WCPFC Convention text which enable votes to be taken Greenpeace strongly urges that members use these provisions in a strategic way to ensure that the WCPFCs decisions are not again hijacked by a small minority of nations that are not acting in the best interest of the valuable tuna resources the health of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPO ecosystems and the future of the people that live in the region
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,10,There have been however some optimistic developments in the region outside of the WCPFC framework namely through the Third Implementing Arrangement which was agreed by the Parties to the Nauru Agreement PNA8 parties in Palau in May 2008 The Commission must build on this agreement and ensure that compatible measures are put in place for the wider WCPO through their final adoption at the 5th annual meeting
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,11,This briefing sets out an overview of some of the key issues related to ensuring the longterm conservation of Pacific tuna and proposes the measures that Greenpeace believes are necessary to protect this valuable resource for future generations EFFORT REDUCTION A WINWIN FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND PROFITABILITY The fluctuating fuel costs that are borne by industry are additional validation for conservation that ensures a future for all fishing industries and subsidiary agencies The many unknowns of climate change impacts on the oceans and the tuna stocks are further impetus
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,12,To that end Greenpeace welcomes that conservation and management measures for bigeye and yellowfin tuna will be a priority at this years meeting However Greenpeace believes that even stronger measures are necessary to ensure that overfishing will not continue on these tuna stocks and that the fishery is put on a stronger economically profitable footing WCPFC Convention Article 2 httpwwwwcpfcintpdftextpdf See Greenpeace Mediterranean tuna management an international disgrace 11 September 2008 At httpwwwgreenpeaceorginternationalpressreleasesiccatinternationaldisgrace11092008 WCPFC Convention Article 20 Parties to the Nauru Agreement Federated States of Micronesia Kiribati Marshall Islands Nauru Palau Papua New Guinea Solomon Islands and Tuvalu Greenpeace Briefing to WCPFC5 Page 3 In particular Greenpeace is concerned that the 30 reduction recommended by the Secretariat based on the recent Science Committee SC49 for bigeye tuna and measures that reduce the risk of overfishing on yellowfin tuna are not precautionary enough to reverse the decline in stock levels and to improve the longterm economic viability of the fishery SC4 found that overfishing of bigeye is now definitely occurring10 and also acknowledged that additional reductions may be necessary It is important to remember that figures are often unreliable for management purposes catch data collected during fishing trips were not consistent were underreported misreported or unavailable Illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing underreporting and the increasing and intensive use of fish aggregating devices FADs and accompanying by catch and mortality all mean that the data available to WCPFC is very unreliable and probably understates the level of fishing effort A recent report on the global extent of illegal fishing estimated the amount of IUU fishing in the West and Central Pacific Ocean to be approximately of the reported catches between 214611 an amount that seriously undermines the accuracy of scientific assessments and calls for a much more precautionary level of effort limits in the legal fisheries This highlights the importance of being guided by the precautionary approach in the face of many unknowns which is why Greenpeace is calling for a 50 effort reduction in the Pacific tuna fisheries
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,13,Such an effort reduction would not only help put the fishery onto a longterm sustainable footing but also goes a long way towards making the fishery more economically profitable Economic studies continue to show that the worlds fishing fleets are not economically efficient and are often operating at a loss depending on whether or not they receive government subsidies A recent report in October 2008 by the World Bank and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation FAO showed that the difference between the potential and actual net economic benefits from marine fisheries is in the order of 50 billion per year12
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,14,Many studies show that significantly reducing fishing effort for tuna would both increase productivity profitability and net economic benefits Detailed studies in the Pacific tuna fisheries have show that by reducing fishing effort including the number of vessels and now FADS resource rents could increase by between 10 and 40 of gross revenues In a modeling exercise conducted in 2000 a theoretical reduction of Pacific purse seine fleet effort to less than of 1996 levels showed fleet revenues would fall by only 15 but that costs would fall by Most significantly resource rent could have more than doubled and returns to coastal States from tuna access fees could have also risen by 39 under the existing fee structure13
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,15,A study by Kompas et al14 shows that a 36 reduction in purse seine effort from 2004 effort levels over the next 5 years and a 32 reduction thereafter as well as a smaller reduction in the frozen and fresh longline fisheries in the short term This would analysis suggests such reductions would increase the profitability of the fishery by 30 over a 50year planning horizon To do so however requires that DWF nations collectively agree on large effort reductions in Tim Dempster and Marc Taquet Fadbase and Future Directions for Ecological Studies of FadAssociated Fish SPC Fisheries Newsletter No 112 JanuaryMarch 2005 1819 at httpswwwspcintcoastfishnewsFishNews112Dempster112pdf See Summary Report at httpwwwwcpfcintsc4pdf0SC420Summary20Report20Preliminary20versionrev1pdf para 143 No stock assessment for yellowfin tuna was conducted for 2008 so SC3 recommendations stand Para 148 Very high probability of 100 Para 139 MRAG and Fisheries Ecosystems Restoration Centre British Columbia University 2008 The Global Estimate of Illegal Fishing Sunken Billions Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform 2008 FAO and World Bank Bertignac M Campbell HF Hampton J and Hand AJ Maximizing resource rent from the Western and Central Pacific tuna fisheries Marine Resource Economics Vol 15 No 3 2000 Tom Kompas and Tuong Nhu Che Economic profit and optimal effort in the Western and Central Pacific tuna fisheries 2006 Pacific Economic Bulletin at httpwwwcrawfordanueduaupdfstafftomkompasKompasPEBpdf and see Grafton Q Kompas T and Hilborn R W Economics of Overexploitation Revisited Science Washington Dec 07 2007 Vol 318 Iss 5856 p 1601 Greenpeace Briefing to WCPFC5 Page 4 fishing capacity and comply with scientific recommendations and the wishes of coastal States to enter into the fisheries An acrosstheboard precautionary effort reduction of 50 would not only put the fishery on a longterm sustainable footing but also help increase the economic returns and viability of the industry a winwin situation for both financial returns and sustainability
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,16,The draft yellowfinbigeye measure needs to be amended to take account of these considerations particularly the 50 cut a ban on FADs and to ensure the closure of the high seas pockets
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,17,HIGH SEAS ENCLAVES PIRATES PLAYGROUND Greenpeace has conducted three ship tours in the WCPO region15 Our most recent tour was from early April to June 2008 During these expeditions we have found evidence that IUU fishing and unreported transhipments are pervasive in the high seas areas in particular the high seas pockets known as the donut holes16 In particular Greenpeace found Vessels in international waters either fishing transiting or waiting for transhipment refuelling and supplies Pirate vessels operating in the region use the donut holes to avoid monitoring and enforcement and to transfer their catches without reporting Some vessels did not have valid fishing licenses or were not authorised to be in the region Several longline vessels encountered by Greenpeace did not possess valid fishing licenses in any of the Pacific Island Country PICs using the high seas exclusively for their fishing operations Large amounts of shark fin and tails were recorded on board these vessels A Panamanian reefer that was not legally authorised to be in the region during the time of sighting was able to get on to the temporary vessel register almost immediately after our sighting showing that vessels have no incentive for compliance given the weak vessel registration processes and procedures Discrepancies between vessel registration details retained by the two regulatory bodies FFA and WCPFC
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,18,These findings show the vulnerable and unregulated nature of the high seas with evidence of IUU activity commonly occurring alongside legally licensed vessels in the donut holes The findings also clearly show yet again that allowing atsea transhipments continues to be a major loophole that facilitates the unknown and unreported plundering of tuna resources from the region
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,19,Greenpeace also found vessels only authorised to fish in the high seas pockets by the Commission but were not authorised to fish in any of the exclusive economic zones EEZs of the coastal states This leaves these areas wide open to abuse far from the scrutiny of the coastal states as next to no enforcement capacity exists in the high seas A detailed summary of findings from our recent expedition is available online17
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,20,MARINE RESERVES CONSERVATION AND FISHERIES BENEFITS A critical element of the sustainability equation is the protection and conservation of the rich biodiversity of the ocean ecosystem which extends beyond the target species themselves Summaries of findings from our past ship tour can be obtained at httpwwwgreenpeaceorgaustraliaresourcesreportsoverfishing The first international water bounded by Papua New Guinea with Federated States of Micronesia Indonesia and Palau The second larger boundary is bordered by Papua New Guinea Nauru Marshall Islands Federated States of Micronesia Kiribati Tuvalu and the Solomon Islands Including the southern area bounded by Fiji Solomon Islands and Vanuatu The report is at httpwwwgreenpeaceorgaustraliaresourcesreportsoverfishingdefendingourpacific2008su Greenpeace Briefing to WCPFC5 Page 5
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,21,There is a growing body of evidence that the establishment of a network of marine reserves can lead to enhanced yields in adjacent fishing grounds Marine reserves enable the development of more natural extended population age structures that promote resilience to overfishing and are important in maintaining the integrity of marine ecosystems in the face of climate change In addition marine reserves can also help provide a more predictable catch from year to year enhancing fisheries stability They also serve as a form of insurance against management failure resulting in degradation of the ecosystem in nondesignated areas
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,22,Marine reserves also enhance catches beyond their boundaries as a result of either the spillover of adults and juveniles across reserve boundaries or from the export of larvae or eggs from reserves to fished areas However this benefit is most marked when the nondesignated areas are subject to failing management and overfishing While the benefits of protection are more apparent for species spending much or all of their time within a marine reserve reserves can also offer protection to migratory species particularly if reserves are created in places where these species are especially vulnerable such as spawning and nursery ground as well as aggregation sites such as seamounts For highly mobile species like tuna it is also important to encompass an adequate and significant proportion of their critical habitat
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,23,The need to establish a representative network of MPAs by 201218 the recent agreement at the CBD in May to adopt scientific criteria for MPAs19 and current efforts to establish a high seas MPA by OSPAR all show that there is real impetus to take action on the high seas
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,24,NEED FOR GREATER COORDINATION THE IMPORTANCE OF UPDATED FISHING RECORD VESSELS AND IUU LISTS The threat of IUU fishing spans all corners of the globe and the pirate catch is estimated to be worth up to 11 billion annually In the Pacific alone the IUU catch is estimated to be around US 134 400 million per year or 4 times greater than the money the PICs receive in access fees from their tuna resources20 Unless there is much greater cooperation and coordination it will be a nearimpossible task to ensure unscrupulous operators are no longer out at sea Information sharing will be a vital element of this coordination Therefore Greenpeace strongly supports the development by the WCPFC of a webbased up to date record of fishing vessels that are active in the Convention area
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,25,The procedures dictated under the current Conservation and Management measures CMMs to establish a list of vessels presumed to have carried out IUU fishing activities in the WCPO CMM200703 need to be strengthened to ensure that vessels that have carried out IUU activities are scrutinised and listed subsequently on the Commissions IUU list Greenpeace was extremely disappointed at the precedents set at TCC4 where eleven vessels were nominated for listing but only two succeeded to make the provisional listing Greenpeace therefore suggests the strengthening of CMM 200703 as outlined in the annex below
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,26,TRANSLATING REGIONAL PROGRESS INTO ACTION AT THE WCPFC As a result of the failure of the 4th annual meeting of the WCPFC in December 2007 to agree to World Summit on Sustainable Development Johannesburg Plan of Implementation AConf19920 JPOI para CBD COP 9 Decision IX20 Marine and coastal biodiversity Bonn 19 30 May 2008 at httpwwwcbdintdecisionsmCOP09id11663lg0 para 14 and Annex I Greenpeace Pirates of the Pacific Loopholes and solutions in the fight against illegal unreported and unregulated fishing in the Pacific2004 and Richards A Fisheries Monitoring Control and Surveillance in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean Region Forum Fisheries Report 0325 Solomon Islands See also UK Review of Impacts of Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing on Developing Countries FINAL REPORT July 2005 at httpwwwdfidgovukpubsfilesillegalfishingmragreportpdf Greenpeace Briefing to WCPFC5 Page 6 urgently needed conservation measures for bigeye and yellowfin tuna a number of Pacific Island coastal States decided to consider an alternative approach to ensuring key measures were taken to protect their important tuna resources Coastal States agreed that they should adopt and implement measures for their EEZs with the WCPFC focusing on its main task of addressing overall stock status and standards and applying compatible measures on the high seas This led to the Parties to the Nauru Agreement PNA agreeing in May 2008 the Third Implementing Arrangement to address the current level of overfishing and to stop the further decline of two commercial tuna stocks bigeye and yellowfin tuna
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,27,This agreement ensures Prevention of operators from fishing in the high seas pockets bounded by their waters enforced by conditions attached to fishing licenses a ban on the use of Fish Aggregation Devices FADs in their EEZs for three months per year and catch retention and no discarding of catch whether the harvested catch is undersized matured target or non targeted catch or bycatch
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,28,The 3rd Implementing Arrangement was seen as a necessary response to the general crisis in the bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks and to enhance the PICs longer term benefits from the tuna fisheries In particular the closure of the high seas pockets is an important contribution to tuna conservation as it will stop the use of these high seas areas as havens for IUU fishing as well as contributing to the longoverdue regional network of marine reserves
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,29,This agreement was welcomed by Leaders at the Pacific Island Forum21 in Niue Leaders also reaffirmed the central importance of regional solidarity through effective fisheries management of their tuna resources and encouraged members to adopt a coordinated approach in their negotiations in the WCPFC22 Pacific Island countries are now urging members of the WCPFC to adopt similar measures for the high seas by WCPFC5 in Busan
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,30,BAN THE FAD STOP THE WASTE Greenpeace believes that the use of fish aggregations devices FADs should be totally banned rather than limited to a 3 month prohibition as currently proposed because of their negative impacts on wider marine life The increase in purse seining in the Pacific has seen a huge increase in the catch of tuna using FADS in the skipjack and yellowfin fisheries Unfortunately mounting evidence shows that the use of FADs not only increases the efficiency of purse seine operations causing a large increase in fishing effort but also lays waste to other marine life
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,31,Every time a FAD is used an average of 10 of the catch by weight will not be the type of tuna that is targeted but juveniles of other tuna species turtles sharks and a wide variety of other fish species23 Scientific research from 2005 concludes that the global bycatch on floating FADs in tuna fisheries amounts to 100000 tonnes every year with catches around moored FADs resulting in further bycatch24
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,32,According to the University of Hawaiis pelagic fishing program FADs fished by purse seine are considered a major contributor toward yellowfin and bigeye stocks being pushed towards an This is the annual meeting of the 16 Pacific Islands Forum countries Federated States of Micronesia Kiribati Republic of Marshall Islands Nauru Palau Papua New Guinea Solomon Islands Tuvalu Tonga Samoa Vanuatu Niue Cook Islands Fiji New Zealand and Australia Forum Communiqu 39 Pacific Islands Forum Alofi Niue 1920 August 2008 Annex A D Bromhead J Foster R Attard J Findlay and J Kalish Review of the impact of fish aggregating devices FADs on tuna fisheries Australian Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry 2003 Tim Dempster and Marc Taquet Fadbase and Future Directions for Ecological Studies of FadAssociated Fish SPC Fisheries Newsletter No 112 JanuaryMarch 2005 1819 at httpswwwspcintcoastfishnewsFishNews112Dempster112pdf Greenpeace Briefing to WCPFC5 Page 7 overfished condition with high numbers of juveniles being caught as bycatch25 Given that yellowfin and bigeye are of high commercial value it is both environmentally destructive and uneconomical to accidentally kill these young especially in the pursuit of the less valuable skipjack
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,33,There is also growing evidence that FADs seriously disrupt the lifecycles of tuna that have not been caught In May 2008 scientists reported that FADs appear to act like magnets that attract the tuna and other fish towards ecologically inappropriate waters with scarcer food supplies distorting their migratory routes and possibly causing them to become undernourished This has potentially serious broader ecological consequences26
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,34,It should also be noted that during their soak times FADs are in effect actively fishing by attracting and gathering fish This phenomenon is currently not adequately incorporated into the effort calculations of the purse seine fisheries distorting the scientific basis of the CPUE calculations of Pacific fisheries and management measures such as the Vessel Day Scheme
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,35,VOTING Pacific Island countries must be prepared to invoke the voting provisions of Article 20 of the Convention strategically which provide that for decisions on questions of substance to be taken by a threefourths majority of those present and voting including a threefourths majority of the members of the FFA present and voting and a threefourths majority of nonmembers of the FFA present and voting A proposal cannot be defeated by two or fewer votes in either chamber
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,36,It must be noted that under Article 203 any representative which should be taken to mean member the Commission may by a majority of those present and voting defer the taking of a decision until such time during the same session as the Commission may decide At that time the Commission shall take a vote on the deferred question This rule may be applied only once to any question Being a question of procedure this would mean a simple majority In practical terms this means that a DWFN could attempt to delay and derail the vote PICs should be prepared for this We also note that CNMs may want to optout of a decision taken by majority Any such decision must be taken as an indicator of the commitment of CNMs to sustainability and to the Pacific CNMS APPLICATION FOR COOPERATING NONMEMBER STATUS Under Agenda item 2 a number of applications are expected to be made for cooperating non member CNM status
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,37,The Commission must take a cautious approach to applications for CNM status Crucial issues to consider are the status of the stocks and the existing level of fishing effort in the fishery and the applicants record of compliance with the Convention and its measures The Secretariat should be asked to conduct a full assessment of CMMs to assess which are applicable to CNMs and what the implications are A further probationary step of compliance with CMMs and any specific requirements could be instituted prior to the according of CNM status WCPFC should note that there is no uniform practice among RFMOs regarding nonmembers so it is important for the Commission not to rush into hasty action

WCPFC5-2008-OP01,40,SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS Greenpeace believes that bold measures need to be taken in order to avoid the collapse of the worlds major fishery and the loss of livelihood and food supply for the coastal states of the Pacific In particular we urge the WCPFC to prioritize the following recommendations at the WCPFC 5 The cessation of fishing in the high seas areas bounded by Pacific Island states as a first step towards becoming notake marine reserves as part of a holistic ecosystem approach to both conserve their rich biodiversity and as a key fisheries management measure These reserves would be the start of a network of reserves throughout the region and globally That the Commission be firmly guided by the precautionary approach and account for the high levels of unknown and uncertainties in fishing data due to the high level of IUU fishing in the region by supporting and adopting a 50 reduction in tuna fishing effort across the entire WCPO sector based on the average 20012004 The banning of all atsea transhipments with no exemptions granted to any country The permanent ban on the use of FADs in purse seine fishing in order to protect juveniles and other marine life That the Commission takes a cautious approach to applications for cooperating non member status That CMM 20073 on IUU Fishing be amended to eliminate loopholes and exemptions

WCPFC5-2008-OP01,42,ANNEX APPLICATIONS FOR CNM STATUS Greenpeace notes the need for caution Crucial issues to consider are the status of the stocks and the existing level of fishing effort in the fishery and the applicants record of compliance with the Convention and its measures28 As outlined in the IOTC29 caution shall be used to ensure against the introduction of excessive fishing capacity of other regions into the Convention Area or IUU fishing activities through the granting of CNM status to non members30 Nonmembers should not be admitted on the basis of their IUU fishing record There is also the risk that new members will not help the Commission adopt meaningful measures particularly as stocks and existing level of effort in the fishery is a major concern as well as some of these nonmembers poor record of compliance31 CNM status shall be revoked if the nationals or fishing vessels of the CNM have undermined the effectiveness of CMMs32 All this points to the crucial nature of the fishing record of wouldbe CNMs
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,43,The Chairs Proposal33 needs to be amended to take into account the matters listed in paragraph 12 of the Proposal before the application is accepted including especially the status of fish stocks fishing practices of the applicant and the needs of coastal fishing communities and coastal States Some of these matters were included in paragraph 5 of CMM 200402 it is unclear why in the new Proposal they are not included as criteria for CNM status
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,44,Some members may consider that it is better for fishing States to be included in the Commission However until the Commission starts adopting meaningful measures that effectively address overfishing this approach must be questioned Since CNMs participate as observers they do not participate in a vote but they can still delay and obstruct discussions 34 Also CNMs are often included as CCMs in measures35 thus in some ways assimilating them to membership
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,45,Chatham House has recently published a comprehensive analysis of the practice of various RFMOs with respect to nonmembers36 That analysis shows that there is a wide variation in WCPFC Article 325 and see Article 352 for membership CMM 200402 Conservation and Management Measure on Cooperating NonMember see Articles 4 and 5 which implements Article 32 and governs CNM status subjects approval of CNM status to a review of the States compliance with the Conventions and other RFMOs provisions and measures requires the Commission to consider the status of the stocks and the existing level of fishing effort in the fishery and its record of compliance with the Convention and its measures See Secretariat paper Consideration of Applications for Cooperating NonMember Status and Membership WCPFCTCC22219 September 2006 at httpwwwwcpfcinttcc2pdfWCPFCTCC22006205BConsideration20of20Applications20for20Cooperating20Non Member20Status20and20Membership5Dpdf Report of the Eighth Session of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission Victoria Seychelles 712 December 2003 at httpwwwiotcorgfilesproceedings2003sIOTC2003S08RENpdf Para 5 page 44 CMM 200402 Para 9 The Convention provides that such cooperating nonparties to this Convention shall enjoy benefits from participation in the fishery commensurate with their commitment to comply with and their record of compliance with conservation and management measures in respect of the relevant stocks WCPFC Article 324 200402 para 11 Draft WCPFC Proposal Cooperating NonMembers Amendments To CMM 200402 WCPFC52008Dp03 8th November 2008 httpwwwwcpfcintwcpfc5pdfWCPFC52008 DP0320Proposal20by20the20Chair20of20the20WG2020Cooperating20NonMemberspdf WCPFC Article 325 In CMM 200401 the provisions are expressly said to apply to CNMs paragraph 19 and it is clearly stated in paragraph 1c that fishing may only be conducted by vessels flagged by members But CMM 200501 applies to CCMs Daniel Owen Recommended Best Practices for Regional Fisheries Management Organizations Technical Study No 2 Practice of RFMOs Regarding Nonmembers October 2007 At httpwwwchathamhouseorgukpublicationspapersviewid554 Greenpeace Briefing to WCPFC5 Appendix Page 2 practice amongst RFMOs For instance NAFO has not adopted any framework provisions on cooperating noncontracting parties and there are currently no States37 or fishing entities with cooperating status38 and the ICCAT has only granted cooperating status to Guyana and Chinese Taipei39 These examples show that there is no uniform practice requiring that CNM status be granted urgently
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,46,New Zealands useful paper on CNMs for TCC440 needs to be understood in light of the fact that firstly the world has changed since UNCLOS was signed in 1982 secondly the right to fish is subject to a lot of obligations including but in addition to the obligation to cooperate Within UNCLOS itself the right to fish is subject to treaty obligations the rights duties and interests of coastal States and Section 2 of UNCLOS on Conservation and Management of the Living Resources of the High Seas41 All States have the duty to take or to cooperate with other States in taking measures for their respective nationals necessary for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas42 and States have the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment43 There are now many other obligations including under the Fish Stocks Agreement 44 the CBD45 CITES 46 CMS47 and regional and subregional agreements as well as RFMOs Parties to the Fish Stocks Agreement in particular must cooperate with WCPFC48 and apply its measures This all means that the right to fish is far from an unrestricted right In effect the freedom of the seas is better understood as freedom for the seas49 It is also worth bearing in mind that some of the applicants are not party to the Fish Stocks Agreement or UNCLOS
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,47,New Zealands proposed way forward suggests building on Secretariat paper DP11 to WCPFC350 However the list of factors to take into account51 should not be just to determine Regional Economic Integration Organization Owen page 101 Owen page 38 Cooperating NonMembers At WCPFC5 WCPFCTCC42008DP02 Rev1 12 September 2009 at httpwwwwcpfcinttcc4pdfWCPFCTCC42008DP0220Rev120CNMs20at20WCPFC5pdf Law of the Sea Convention Article 116 Law of the Sea Convention Article 117 Law of the Sea Convention Article 192 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United National Convention on the Law of the Sea of December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks The agreement was ratified by the requisite 30 countries and came into force on 11 December 2001 See text and list of ratifications at httpwwwunorgDeptslosconventionagreementsconventionoverviewfishstockshtm Convention on Biological Diversity concluded at Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992 entered into force 29 December at 31 ILM 818 CBD at httpwwwbiodivorgconventiondefaultshtml The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora signed at Washington DC 3 March 1973 entered into force 1 July 1975 amended at Bonn 22 June 1979 993 UNTS 243 copy as amended at httpwwwcitesorgengdisctextshtml Convention on Migratory Species FSA Article 17 See at Greenpeace Freedom for the Seas Now and for the Future at httpwwwgreenpeaceorgrawcontentusapresscenterreports4FreedomfortheSeaspdf Proposed Revisions To CMM200402 WCPFC42007DP11 6th November 2007 The suggested 5 bis read The Commission shall determine the nature and extent of participatory rights including specification of rights applicable under existing Conservation and Management Measures of a Cooperating nonmember in a fishery taking into account inter alia a the status of the straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and the existing level of fishing effort in the fishery b the respective interests fishing patterns and fishing practices of new and existing members or participants c the respective contributions of new and existing members or participants to conservation and management of the stocks to the collection and provision of accurate data and to the conduct of scientific research on the stocks d the needs of coastal fishing communities which are dependent mainly on fishing for the stocks Greenpeace Briefing to WCPFC5 Appendix Page 3 the nature and extent of participatory rights but to determine whether the application is approved at all We appreciate that the language is taken from FSA Article 11 but that Article is applicable to new members not nonmembers The scheme for nonmembers is provided in Article 17 and in essence is an agreement to apply the conservation and management measures established by such organization In short New Zealand is proposing a yes but approach whereas we suggest more of a no unless or until approach It is obvious for instance that new CNMs should not be entitled to catch 2000 tonnes of bigeye tuna52 but it is equally clear that an analysis needs to be carried out on all CMMs to assess which are applicable to CNMs and what the implications are It is therefore too early to consider applications until this is carried out This would also have the advantage of allowing the WCPFC time to assess and analyse its measures and for further consultation
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,48,REVIEW OF CMM 20073 ON IUU FISHING CMM 2007353 is an important measure addressing IUU fishing however Greenpeace believes that it should be amended Paragraph 15 provides that the Technical Compliance Committee shall not include a vessel on the Provisional IUU Vessel List if the vessels flag State demonstrates three factors This should be a discretionary rather than a mandatory prohibition
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,49,Currently the measure reads as a The vessel fished in a manner consistent with WCPFC Conservation Measures or the laws and regulations of a State when fishing in waters under the jurisdiction of that State or have fished exclusively for species not covered by the WCPFC Convention This paragraph could exempt a boat which fished consistently with national regulations but inconsistently with WCPFC Conservation Measures It also provides for an exemption where the vessel has fished exclusively for nonWCPFC species even though the vessel may have contributed to IUU activities involving WCPFC
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,50,It should thus read a The vessel fished in a manner consistent with WCPFC Conservation Measures and the laws and regulations of a State when fishing in waters under the jurisdiction of that State b Effective action has been taken in response to the IUU fishing activities in question such as inter alia prosecution or the imposition of sanctions of adequate severity or Such an action is required in any case In no way should it provide exemption from the IUU list It is a case of and not or
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,51,The following provision is openended and vague and is open to abuse Greenpeace therefore recommends it be deleted c That the case regarding the vessel or vessels that conducted IUU fishing activities has been settled to the satisfaction of the CCM that originally submitted the vessel for listing and the flag State involved
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,52,There are also some dangerous exemptions contained in paragraph 25 which allows removal from the list These include that States can request the removal of a vessel from the register on the following grounds
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,53,e the needs of coastal States whose economies are overwhelmingly dependent on the exploitation of living marine resources f the interests of developing States from the subregion or region in whose areas of national jurisdiction the stocks also occur and g the development and implementation of an effective MCS framework for the Commission CMM 200501 para 18 Belize voluntarily agreed to limit its catch to about 800 tonnes See NZ paper para 29 CMM 20073 Conservation and Management Measure to Establish a List of Vessels Presumed to have Carried out Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing Activities in the WCPO Greenpeace Briefing to WCPFC5 Appendix Page 4 c it has taken effective action in response to the IUU fishing activities that resulted in the vessels inclusion in the WCPFC IUU Vessel List including prosecution or the imposition of sanctions of adequate severity As noted for paragraph 15 this is something that should be done in any case but in no way should justify the removal of a vessel from an IUU list This should be deleted
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,54,d the vessel has changed ownership and that the new owner can establish that the previous owner no longer has any legal financial or real interests in the vessel or exercises control over it and that the new owner has not participated in IUU fishing activities or This should include beneficial interest and should read

WCPFC5-2008-OP01,56,e the case regarding the vessel or vessels that conducted IUU fishing activities has been settled to the satisfaction of the CCM that originally submitted the vessel for listing and the flag State involved
WCPFC5-2008-OP01,57,This is openended vague and open to abuse and should therefore be deleted
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,1,FIFTH REGULAR SESSION 12 December 2008 Busan Korea WWFTRAFFIC POSITION PAPER WCPFC52008OP02 December 2008
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,2,Introduction Recognizing that the WCPFC is now in its fifth year of existence WWF and TRAFFIC believe that the time for significant action is well overdue in collectively agreeing to and implementing conservation and management measures for the sustainable exploitation of the Pacifics tuna resources
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,3,The concern over the decline in bigeye tuna BET and yellowfin tuna YFT is not fully reflected in the management of fishing behavior We must recognize that our inaction will make a mockery of our ability to take firm decisions and implement them when they matter most The level of actions undertaken by the Commission over the last five years does not reflect the seriousness of the declining tuna stocks
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,4,WWF and TRAFFIC support the proposed Conservation Management Measure CMM for BET and YFT in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPO to reduce fishing mortality of BET and YFT by the 30 recommended by the Scientific Committee
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,5,This position statement provides brief comment on all those matters that WWF and TRAFFIC believe are essential elements in order to achieve the required conservation outcomes with regard to reducing the overall fishing mortality of BET and YFT across all fishing sectors operating with in the WCPFC convention area including bycatch of nontarget species
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,6,Comprehensive Spatial and Temporal Closures WWF and TRAFFIC strongly support the implementation of a series of comprehensive flexible and adaptable temporal and spatial closures These closures are urgently required to help protect key tuna spawning events within the Convention Area
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,7,WWF and TRAFFIC recognize that the timing and area for such closures will vary for each population However the Commission needs to establish a standing obligation to introduce and maintain such closures whilst allowing the Scientific Committee to advise the Commission on the optimal location and period for such closures each year
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,8,Furthermore WWF and TRAFFIC strongly support the following proposed closures
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,9,o 3 month purse seine closure on the high seas
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,10,WWF and TRAFFIC believe that permanent closures of these areas to all fishing vessels must be considered in the near future unless fishing is subject to measures that meet fishing nations obligations in international law to impose controls on their vessels fishing on the high seas compatible with those imposed by adjacent coastal states within their EEZs
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,11,o 3month FAD closure
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,12,WWF and TRAFFIC further calls for an overall reduction of FADs used by catching vessels throughout the entire fishing year It is essential to have 100 observer coverage during any FAD closure periods If this cannot be agreed then the alternative recommended by WWF and TRAFFIC is that all purse seine vessels must be confined to port during FAD closures This is essential if compliance with FAD closures is to be ensured
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,13,Regional Observer Program WWF and TRAFFIC consider that all CMMs must be underpinned by a comprehensive and strong Regional Observer Program ROP with 100 coverage of all fishing vessels including both catching and support vessels WWF and TRAFFIC consider that there are no reasonable impediments to immediate introduction of 100 observer coverage for purse seine catcher vessels and all support vessels while full observer coverage for longliners should be phased in over no more than five years
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,14,WWF and TRAFFIC suggests the following timetable for a 5year phasein of ROP coverage for all fishing vessels
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,15,o 2009 All support vessels resupply refueling reefers for all high seas fishing have 100 ROP coverage
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,16,o 2009 All purse seine vessels have 100 observer coverage o 2009 10 of all longliners including at least one from each flag state have an ROP observer on board o 2010 25 of all longliners including at least one from each flag state have an ROP observer on board o 2011 50 of all longliners including more than half of all vessels from each flag state have an ROP observer on board o 2012 100 of all longliners have an ROP observer on board
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,17,Catch Documentation Scheme WWF and TRAFFIC consider the failure to implement a catch documentation scheme CDS is a significant problem Without an electronic CDS eCDS major gaps will exist in the management framework for fisheries regulated by WCPFC
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,18,WWF and TRAFFIC International recently tabled a joint report The Case for a Catch Documentation Scheme in the Western and Central Pacific WCPFC TCC42008OP01 at TCC 4 The paper examines experiences in the application of TDSCDS by other RFMOs and reviews current international thinking on the relative merits of the two types of schemes as a basis for making firm recommendations in favour of eCDS as the appropriately effective documentation program for BET in the WCPFC There is an emerging consensus in global fisheries fora that it is catch rather than trade documentation schemes that are required in order to verify catch data to monitor catch against catch limits and to reliably inform markets and to minimize opportunities for the marketing of product derived from IUU fishing
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,19,This paper provides a clear direction for the WCPFC in its consideration of the appropriate form of documentation scheme for BET in the WCPFC It would be shortsighted and potentially compromise the status of stocks under its management if the WCPFC were to ignore this direction
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,20,It is time for the WCPFC to take urgent action to address overfishing and to support and enforce that action by the introduction of a eCDS WCPFC needs to ensure that all high seas fish stocks managed by RFMOs be subject to the eCDS as a proactive precautionary measure WWF and TRAFFIC recognize that the introduction of an eCDS will pose some challenges to the WCPFC in the context of the nature of the fisheries for BET However the WCPFC must work to overcome these challenges rather than using them as an excuse to implement secondbest solutions in the form of a TDS
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,21,WWF and TRAFFIC recommend that the WCPFC must Agree at its December 2008 meeting to adopt a CDS measure for BET at the meeting including any intercessional work to meet that timetable with a date of implementation of 1 July 2010
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,22,Implement a eCDS that requires documentation to accompany all catch harvested landed transshipped traded domestically exported processed imported and reexported and which relies on electronic documentation Ensure that complementary measures are in place to maximize the effectiveness of the eCDS by
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,23,bringing forward the implementation schedule for the ROP ensuring that a Commission VMS measure is implemented in 2009 ensuring that transshipment at sea does not compromise the effectiveness of the eCDS adopting Port State measures consistent with any global agreement likely to be agreed pursuant to the FAOhosted negotiations currently underway to take effect at the same time as the BET CDS and adopting measures that provide for traderestrictive measures to be taken against flag States with vessels on the IUU list Acknowledge the need to implement eCDS for other tunas and billfish managed by the Commission and in particular commit to the introduction of an eCDS for YFT and Swordfish Xiphias gladius by 1 January 2010 Commit to continuous improvement of the eCDS by investigation for example of the benefits and feasibility of verification systems such as tagging and the use of biotechnology Establish a capacity development fund to act as a costsharing mechanism to provide for cross subsidisation across wealthy and lesswealthy members to ensure the effective implementation and administration of the eCDS and Maximize retailer and public access to CDS data
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,24,Bycatch Performance Measures This is a critical issue of concern to WWF and TRAFFIC WWF and TRAFFIC are keen to ensure that the same urgency is given to developing and implementing corrective measures to recover populations of high conservation value nontarget species as is being given to preventing collapse of populations of target fish stocks of high commercial value WWF and TRAFFIC are particularly concerned at the impact of WCFPC regulated fisheries on sea turtles sharks rays and sea birds
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,25,Sea Turtles WWF and TRAFFIC recognize that sea turtle bycatch in longline fishing operations continues to be a problem in the Western and Central Pacific Already a range of progressive measures have been introduced globally including the use of circle hooks in place of jhooks
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,26,WWF and TRAFFIC further recognize that while trials and experiments on the use of circle hooks to reduce turtle bycatch have been and are being undertaken around the world the use of circle hooks as a turtle mitigation measure in the WCPFC area may be undermined by their impact on sharks However WWF and TRAFFIC believe that by using a combination of mitigation techniques such as prohibition on the use of wire trace could further mitigate sea turtle bycatch concerns while also decreasing the impact of circle hooks on shark bycatch While insufficient data exists on the bycatch levels in the Western and Central Pacific WWF and TRAFFIC urge the Commission to undertake precautionary measures in the absence of such data
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,27,In addition we urge the WCPFC to mandate the carriage on all vessels and use of the following mitigation gears currently available to the fishery This list is not exhaustive and there may be additional devices that should be included on this list turtle dehookers line cutters circle hooks whole fish baits prohibition on the use of wire trace identification of sea turtle hotspots and implement spatial and temporal closures as appropriate development of performance measures bycatch trigger limit for all sea turtle species Implementation of comprehensive management action if trigger limit activated Such measures for adoption to include move on provisions short term spatial and temporal closures and restrictions on gear types primarily longline used in certain areas 100 observer coverage on longliners in EEZs and on the high seas
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,28,Sharks Sharks play a crucial role in the balance and health of marine ecosystems They are slowgrowing longlived and produce few young which leaves them extremely vulnerable to overfishing Most sharks also play an important role as top predators in the ecosystem and significant reductions in their numbers are likely to have impacts on other elements of those ecosystems The extent and nature of those impacts are largely unknown
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,29,Given the role of sharks in ocean ecosystems it is essential that any fishery impacting on their populations must adopt Ecosystem Based Management EBM principles and be applied rigorously to the management of those fisheries WWF and TRAFFIC note the fact that the WCPFC has adopted a conservation and management measure that came into effect as of 1 January 2008
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,30,However recent evidence from SC4 based on the ecological risk assessment indicates that there is no difference in catch rates for sharks by longliners above and below 24 m overall length The SC stated that there appears to be no scientific basis to justify the current exemption for small vessels and recommended that the shark measure be revised to include vessels under 24 m
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,31,WWF and TRAFFIC strongly support the advice and recommendation of SC4 on this measure Furthermore WWF and TRAFFIC recommend that any fin ratio must be based on wet weight not dry weight for both trunk and fins This exemption makes the CMM adopted by the WCPFC the weakest of all shark measures adopted by any of the tuna RFMOs Hence WWF and TRAFFIC wish to see this exemption removed immediately at the upcoming Commission meeting
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,32,WWF and TRAFFIC recommend that the following action be taken immediately at this Commission meeting prohibition on the use of wire trace prohibition on the take of any shark ray or shark ray product by any WCPFC vessel until such time that specific shark and or ray species can be demonstrated to be harvested sustainably in terms of EBM development of performance measures bycatch trigger limit for all shark and ray species implementation of comprehensive management action if trigger limit activated Such measures for adoption to include moveon provisions short term spatial and temporal closures and restrictions on gear types primarily longline used in certain areas identification of shark and ray bycatch hotspots within the Convention area and 100 observer coverage on longliners in EEZs and on the high seas
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,33,Further information regarding the critical plight of sharks and recommendations to mitigate this issue is contained in the TRAFFIC report titled Confronting Shark Conservation Head On located at the following URL httpwwwtrafficorgspeciesreportstrafficspeciesfish4pdf
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,34,Seabirds WWF and TRAFFIC are concerned at the outcome and lack of the seabird discussion at previous meetings WWF and TRAFFIC believe that the seabird bycatch mitigation specifications should be minimum standards binding measures not merely guidelines The outcomes of SC3 SC4 and TCC3 have shown that the following actions need to be undertaken collaborative research must be encouraged on specifications that are not fully understood by CCMs ensure that tori lines include branch streamers along the aerial extent of the line and that the branch streamers are of a length that ensures that
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,35,they would touch the surface of the water in the absence of wind and swell information and data sharing among CCMs stop using guidelines and specifications as negotiating tools either to buy time or to stall progress in agreeing to specific measures fishers must be clearly informed regarding operation of the specification of seabird mitigation measures and 100 observer coverage on longliners in EEZs and on the high seas
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,36,WWF and TRAFFIC believe that effective reporting measures bycatch performance measures trigger points and reference limits coupled with appropriate action and timeframes if triggered particularly with respect to sharksrays seabirds and turtles are an essential element of any CMM for the sustainability of fisheries
WCPFC5-2008-OP02,37,CONCLUSION This Commission must be prepared to take the hard decisions to prevent fisheries collapse now Scientists have been calling for large reductions in bigeye tuna catch for over a decade Past performance of the Commission is at best slow to respond to such advice This wavering could lead to the commercial extinction of the bigeye and yellowfin tuna fishery in the WCPO if effective management action isnt adopted at this years Commission meeting If the Commission doesnt move fast on restoring stocks and preventing illegal unreported and unregulated fishing it will directly impact the viability of the regions tuna fisheries and the economies of developing countries

WCPFC5-2008-OP09,2,The international Game Fish Association IGFA is a nonprofit organisation that represents recreational anglers throughout the world IGFA was established in 1939 and has active members in countries is the governing body for international recreational fishing and provides rules for ethical angling practices Many of IGFAs members target highly migratory species managed by the WCPFC
WCPFC5-2008-OP09,3,IGFA has an International Committee of Representatives in 80 countries who have been chosen for their integrity fishing knowledge sportsmanship and conservation work These representatives report to IGFA on issues affecting our interests and are the primary way that IGFA participates in the recreational fishing community In addition to compiling decades of catch information from around the world IGFA staff trustees and international representatives participate in international cooperative research and management efforts Presently IGFA represents its members and recreational anglers in general on numerous regional national and international fisheries management panels and also funds and participates in research relating to game fish and their habitats When participating in cooperative research or management IGFAs core purpose is to provide a link and facilitate interaction and information exchange between recreational anglers and fisheries scientists and managers
WCPFC5-2008-OP09,4,IGFA is extremely interested in the progress of the WCPFC and is hopeful that it will be more successful in managing catch effort and stocks than many of the other international fisheries management organisations IGFA requests that the WCPFC management plan takes into consideration the economically and socially important recreational fishery
WCPFC5-2008-OP09,5,IGFA understands that the management plan must also take into consideration the artisanal fishers of the region
WCPFC5-2008-OP09,6,IGFA believes that spatial management should also be taken into consideration IGFA would be pleased to consult and advise member states on the economic importance of recreational fishing and the related tourism benefits that it creates
WCPFC5-2008-OP09,7,IGFA requests that your statistics and scientific reports reflect the effect on the stocks targeted by recreational fisheries including all marlins IGFA believes it can make a meaningful contribution to the meeting as an observer and help in decisions to keep the conservation of fish stocks to levels that are economically viable to the commercial and recreational industries

WCPFC5-2008-OP11,1,FIFTH REGULAR SESSION 12 December 2008 Busan Korea IUCN OPENING STATEMENT WCPFC52008OP11 December 2008
WCPFC5-2008-OP11,2,Mr Chairman
WCPFC5-2008-OP11,3,On behalf of IUCN I would like to express our appreciation on being invited to attend this WCPFC 5th meeting as an observer IUCN The International Union for Nature Conservation and Natural Resources is the worlds oldest and largest global environmental network It has more than 1000 government and NGO member organizations as well as some 10000 scientists and experts in its specialist groups from countries Six WCFPC member countries are also National State members of IUCN Australia China Korea Japan New Zealand and United States
WCPFC5-2008-OP11,4,The mission of IUCN is to influence encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve the integrity and diversity of nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable IUCN has been active in the Oceania region for many years working through its scientific and technical commissions and with partners The IUCNRegional Programme Office for Oceania was established in Suva in 2005 to allow IUCN to focus more of its efforts on the Pacific Region
WCPFC5-2008-OP11,5,IUCN stands ready to assist in the work of the Commission related to conservation of resources for sustainable use We host six specialist commissions whose members could be called upon to provide advice if required The four with the most relevance to the work of the WCFPC are
WCPFC5-2008-OP11,6,The Commission on Environmental Law CEL which advances environmental law by developing new legal concepts and instruments and by building the capacity to employ environmental law for conservation and sustainable development
WCPFC5-2008-OP11,7,The Commission on Ecosystem Management CEM provides expert guidance on integrated ecosystem approaches to the management of natural and modified ecosystems
WCPFC5-2008-OP11,8,The Species Survival Commission SSC provides advice on the technical aspects of species conservation and mobilizes action for those species that are threatened with extinction
WCPFC5-2008-OP11,9,The World Commission on Protected Areas WCPA promotes the establishment and effective management of a worldwide representative network of terrestrial and marine protected areas
WCPFC5-2008-OP11,10,At the recent World Conservation Congress held in October 2008 a number of resolutions were passed and recommendations made in relation to oceanic fisheries These sought to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems beyond national jurisdiction curb illegal fishing create marine protected area networks and proactively manage human activities to prevent significant adverse effects Over 6000 delegates voted and agreed on these proposals Those most relevant for WCPFC included
WCPFC5-2008-OP11,11,Resolution 4031 related to achieving conservation of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdictions Resolution 4032 regarding the coordination of the Pacific Ocean 2020 Challenge Recommendation 4113 on conserving migratory and oceanic sharks Recommendation 4114 on a global policy against shark finning Recommendation 4117 related to Flag State responsibility regarding Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU fishing
WCPFC5-2008-OP11,12,The full text of these resolutions and recommendations can be found on the IUCN website httpwwwiucnorgcongress08assemblypolicyindexcfm
WCPFC5-2008-OP11,13,IUCN is the only international observer organization in the United Nations General Assembly with expertise in issues concerning the environment specifically biodiversity nature conservation and sustainable natural resource use In this role IUCN provides guidance and support to UN countries and can therefore bring any important issues to the attention of the UN on behalf of WCPFC
WCPFC5-2008-OP11,14,IUCN promotes the ecosystem based approach to fisheries management based on the best available scientific advice In situations where sufficient data and information is not yet available IUCN supports the use of a precautionary approach until the requisite information is available We look forward to your well considered decision from this meeting with regard to the reduction in total catch of bigeye tuna by 30 as recommended by the Scientific Committee with measures starting in January 2009 We also look forward to well considered decisions in relation to conservation and management measures for turtles sharks yellowfin tuna and swordfish
WCPFC5-2008-OP11,15,Thank you

WCPFC6-2009-OP02,1,SIXTH REGULAR SESSION Papeete Tahiti French Polynesia 11 December 2009 WWF AND TRAFFIC POSITION STATEMENT WCPFC62009OP02 December 2009 Submitted by WWF and TRAFFIC
WCPFC6-2009-OP02,2,Disclaimer
WCPFC6-2009-OP02,3,The papers submitted by NGOs and the views expressed therein are being distributed solely in accordance with Rule 365 of the Commissions Rules of Procedure and do not imply endorsement of such views by the Commission or members of the Commission WWFTRAFFIC Position Paper Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC Sixth Regular Session 11 December 2009 Papeete Tahiti PACIFIC BIGEYE TUNA WWF and TRAFFIC note than the WCPFC Scientific Committee SC supported the evaluation of the Conservation and Management Measure CMM document CMM200801 WCPFCSC52009GNWP17 This evaluation concluded CMM200801 is highly unlikely to meet its objectives of a 30 reduction in bigeye tuna fishing mortality from the 20012004 level or maintenance of the bigeye tuna stock at a level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield MSY over the long term The measures are predicted to result in little if any reduction in bigeye tuna FFmsy from the high levels in excess of 20 estimated for 20072008 and accordingly SB is predicted to fall to around 0406 of SBmsy The SC requested that the Science Service Provider SPC provide analyses to WCPFC6 of a range of scenarios including adjustments of the current CMM to remove exemptions as well as other measures to reduce fishing mortality on bigeye tuna to 30 below 20012004 levels According to the report provided by the SPC WCPFC62009IP18 the following scenario was the only one that ended overfishing and prevented bigeye from becoming overfished by 2018 a 50 reduction in longline catches from 2007 levels an 80 reduction in fishaggregating device FAD effort from 2007 levels and a 50 reduction in effort from the domestic fisheries in Indonesia and the Philippines for 2007 levels WWF and TRAFFIC note the SC management advice that a 34 to 50 average of 43 reduction in fishing mortality for bigeye tuna from 20042007 levels is required to end overfishing The SC report also states that the results of more conservative assumptions are that a 61 reduction in fishing mortality is required to end overfishing The findings of the SPC and the SC demonstrate significant uncertainty and therefore precautionary management decisions are necessary WWF and TRAFFIC support conservation and management measures that achieve an immediate 43 reduction in fishing mortality of bigeye tuna in accordance with SC advice PACIFIC BLUEFIN TUNA WWF and TRAFFIC note the advice to WCPFCs Northern Committee NC5 from the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC included a recommendation that the current level of fishing mortality on juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna be reduced below 20022004 levels NC5 was unable to reach consensus on this recommendation but did reach consensus on a draft CMM that seeks to ensure that total fishing effort for Pacific bluefin tuna not be increased from the 20022004 level in 2010 taking into account the need to reduce fishing mortality on juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna WCPFC62009DP07 This represents progress from the voluntary agreement currently in place but falls short of scientific advice WWF and TRAFFIC recommend adoption of WCPFC62009DP07 along with a commitment to adopt a 3year management plan in 2010 that follows scientific advice to reduce fishing mortality of juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna below the 20022004 level SHARKS WWF and TRAFFIC note that the CMM for sharks still needs strengthening further than just adding silky shark to the list of key species WCPFC62009IP14 It needs to be made mandatory the term key species needs to reflect species at high risk and the finning measures need strengthening to naturally attached with the introduction of a productlabelling scheme to monitor compliance with the measures MANAGEMENT ADVICE AND IMPLICATIONS WWF and TRAFFIC note the range of management advice provided by the SC on bigeye tuna Management advice to WCPFC 6 included SC recommends a reduction in fishing mortality of 30 from the 20012004 level in order to return fishing mortality to MSY levels Fmsy SC recommends that the Commission note that recent estimates of FFmsy 151201 reference years 2007 indicate that fishing mortality has increased significantly since 20012004 therefore the streamlined assessment indicates a reduction in fishing mortality of 3450 from the 2004 to levels would be required though there are some uncertainties The current management advice and interpretations of stock status are confusing and difficult to compare from year to year Without clear guidance from the Commission on the objectives of fisheries management decisions it is difficult for the SC to provide management advice that informs fisheries managers of the probability of conservation and management measures achieving the objectives WWF and TRAFFIC recommend that WCPFC set Biological Reference Points for the species it manages including sharks WWF and TRAFFIC remind WCPFC that the Second Joint Meeting of Tuna RFMOs Kobe II in June 2009 recommended the use of the Kobe II Strategy Matrix to improve the presentation of scientific advice making it simple and useful to fisheries managers In November 2009 ICCAT requested scientific advice related to the conservation and management of Atlantic bluefin tuna be provided in the format of the Kobe II Strategy Matrix WWF and TRAFFIC recommend that WCPFC request Management Advice and Implications for the 2010 assessment of bigeye tuna and skipjack tuna in the format of the Kobe II Strategy Matrix INDEPENDENT PERFORMANCE REVIEW The First Joint Meeting of Tuna RFMOs Kobe I in January 2007 agreed to pursue a 14 point Course of Action to improve management of all tuna stocks Point 9 of that action plan was an agreement that the five tuna RFMOs should have their performance reviewed according to a common methodology and a common set of criteria The goal of the reviews is to help the RFMOs improve their effectiveness in achieving their objectives These reviews were to commence as soon as practicable and conducted by a team that includes individuals already associated with the RFMO as well as outside experts Kobe II encouraged WCPFC and the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC to conduct performance reviews as soon as possible to the commitment made in 2007 WWF and TRAFFIC call on WCPFC to follow the recommendation of Technical and Compliance Committee TCC TCC5 and agree to conduct an independent performance review to begin early in 2010 REGIONAL OBSERVER PROGRAM WWF and TRAFFIC were encouraged by the technical improvements made to the WCPFC Regional Observer Program ROP at WCPFC5 as well as the recent progress on the ROP at TCC5 including an agreement to establish a Technical and Operational Advisory Group Establishing a solid foundation on which to operate such a program is vital but the absence of any specific discussion such as a phasein period for regional observer coverage or increasing the overall coverage from 5 is disappointing Global attention by fishing nations is now focused on the western and central Pacific Ocean WCPO and it is urgent that WCPFC implement critical fisheries management measures such as systematic observer coverage Current levels of observer coverage and even the 5 goal to which WCPFC aspires do not come close to providing adequate data to support robust stock assessment and management In 2008 WWF and TRAFFIC recommended a 5year timetable to phasein 100 ROP coverage for all fishing vessels starting with 100 coverage for purseseine vessels and support vessels for high seas fishing ROP coverage for longline fishing vessels could be phased in over five years WWF and TRAFFICs position is that there are no reasonable impediments to immediate introduction of 100 observer coverage for purse seine catcher vessels and all support vessels while full observer for longliners is phasedin over five years WWF and TRAFFIC call on WCPFC6 to implement a phasein plan to achieve 100 observer coverage as soon as practically possible CATCH DOCUMENTATION SCHEME WWF and TRAFFIC recently produced a joint report The Case for a Catch Documentation Scheme in the Western and Central Pacific which provides recommendations for the implementation of an electronic Catch Documentation Scheme eCDS in the WCPFC It is time for the WCPFC to take urgent action to address overfishing and to support and enforce that action by the introduction of an eCDS WCPFC needs to ensure that all high seas fish stocks it manages be subject to the eCDS as a proactive precautionary measure WWF and TRAFFIC note the recommendation from TCC5 to create an intersessional working group on catch documentation to advance the development of a CDS during 2010 This working group is an opportunity for WCPFC to overcome the challenges of implementing a CDS rather than using those challenges as an excuse to implement secondbest solutions WWF and TRAFFIC recommend that WCPFC6 agree to create a formal Intersessional Working Group to develop a CDS measure for bigeye tuna to be reviewed by TCC6 with a date of implementation of 1 July

WCPFC6-2009-OP04,4,Pew Environment Group Opening Statement at the 6th Regular Session of The Western Pacific Fisheries Commission
WCPFC6-2009-OP04,5,On behalf of the Pew Environment Group I want to thank the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission for inviting us to attend this meeting as an observer and allowing us the opportunity to discuss ways to improve the conservation status of Pacific sharks and other species under the responsibility of the WCPFC
WCPFC6-2009-OP04,6,As top predators in the ocean sharks play a critical role in keeping marine ecosystems healthy and the food web in balance Yet up to 73 million sharks are killed annually for the shark fin market and scientists have shown that many shark populations are threatened with extinction Most sharks are slow growing mature late and produce few young making them especially vulnerable to overfishing and slow to recover once depleted Yet there are no limits to the number of sharks taken from the worlds oceans
WCPFC6-2009-OP04,7,The WCPFC has taken initial action to conserve Pacific sharks including Conservation and Management Measure CMM 200806 which calls on all CCMs to implement the UNs International Plan of Action for Sharks IPOA adhere to a 5 fintocarcass weight ratio for sharks and adopt measures to minimize waste from shark catches and encourage the live release of shark bycatch The CMM also asks the Scientific Committee to provide preliminary advice on the stock status of key shark species and propose a research plan for the assessment of the status of these stocks in 2010 And finally a Pacific Islands Regional Plan of Action for Sharks PIRPOA was issued in October 2009 These are all good first steps but stronger more meaningful conservation measures are needed now by WCPFC and its member countries to ensure targeted fishing as well as bycatch wont deplete shark species or drive them toward extinction
WCPFC6-2009-OP04,8,As sharks are among the most biologically vulnerable fish in the ocean and little is known about their population status the Pew Environment Group believes that shark fishing should not occur in the absence of scientific population assessments and precautionary management plans These measures would help ensure sustainable populations for the future Furthermore as sharks are often caught as bycatch wire leaders should be prohibited and other bycatch minimization measures should be implemented
WCPFC6-2009-OP04,9,At this 6th Session of WCPFC the Pew Environment Group urges you to take strong action on sharks by adopting a number of key conservation measures that will help protect shark populations in the Pacific Ocean Specifically we urge you to support the following measures that will help ensure the conservation of shark populations under WCPFCs management purview
WCPFC6-2009-OP04,10,Pew Environment Group December 7 2009 Page 2 of 2
WCPFC6-2009-OP04,11,Prohibit the use of wire leaders to reduce bycatch and encourage the live release of sharks
WCPFC6-2009-OP04,12,Include silky sharks among the key shark species identified in CMM 200806 and also include other species at high risk of overexploitation as identified through Ecological Risk Assessments For example great scalloped and smooth hammerheads sandbar porbeagle and dusky sharks should be included with the silky shark immediately as key shark species for the CMM
WCPFC6-2009-OP04,13,Prohibit the removal of shark fins at sea by requiring that fins be naturally attached on landing This will help ward against the practice of shark finning and facilitate collection of speciesspecific catch data
WCPFC6-2009-OP04,14,Prohibit the retention and landing of exceptionally biologically vulnerable sharks such as the bigeye thresher as adopted by ICCAT this year
WCPFC6-2009-OP04,15,Set catch limits and other management measures for vulnerable shark species lacking stock assessments based on Ecological Risk Assessments
WCPFC6-2009-OP04,16,Make all portions of CMM 200806 mandatory
WCPFC6-2009-OP04,17,Take concrete steps to adhere to the commitments made at the Joint Tuna RFMO meeting in San Sebastian to establish precautionary science based conservation and management measures for sharks including prohibit the retention of particularly vulnerable shark species based on advice from scientists and experts establish precautionary fishing controls for shark species for which there is no scientific advice and improve the provision of data on sharks in all fisheries and by all gears

WCPFC6-2009-OP05,5,state We also documented longline vessel fishing in the high seas and illegally in the EEZ of a PIC It is highly likely many unreported activities are taking place in these areas The expedition was also during the FAD ban period allowing us to show that the twomonth ban of FADs is inadequate and we spotted ten devices in the two major high seas pockets We also documented a fishing support vessel tending a FAD during the close period and vessel fishing on FAD utilising its exemption that was granted by the Commission The WCPFC scientific advice now recommends fishing effort for bigeye tuna to be reduced by 3450 to return stocks to sustainability This is welcomed and should be urgently adopted for implementation by the Commission Greenpeace proposes that WCPFC6 agreed to A 50 reduction in tuna fishing effort across the entire WCPO fisheries based on the average 2004 levels This will be in line with Scientific Committee recommendation in particular to the bigeye stock but is required by the precautionary approach to account for the high levels of unknown and uncertainties in fishing data The closure of the 4 high seas pockets to all fishing and removal of fishing effort that occurs in these areas A ban on all atsea transhipments with no exemptions granted to any vessel CCMs should also adopt compatible measures as outlined under article 8 of the Convention and prohibit all in zone atsea transhipments A permanently ban on the use of FADs in association with purse seine fishing in order to protect juvenile tuna and other marine life

WCPFC6-2009-OP07,5,The resolution on tuna conservation adopted by the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC at its annual meeting in June 2009 includes a paragraph regarding cooperation between the IATTC and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC which reads as follows
WCPFC6-2009-OP07,6,The Director shall continue efforts to promote compatibility between the conservation and management measures adopted by IATTC and WCPFC in their goals and effectiveness including by frequent consultations with his counterpart in WCPFC so that they can maintain and inform their respective organizations of a thorough understanding of conservation and management measures directed at bigeye yellowfin and other tunas and the scientific bases and effectiveness of those measures
WCPFC6-2009-OP07,7,Thus the IATTC clearly recognizes the importance of cooperating closely with the WCPFC in establishing complementary conservation and management measure for species of mutual interest I trust that the members of the WCPFC will take this into consideration in their deliberations on conservation and management measures for the WCPFC region
WCPFC6-2009-OP07,8,I would appreciate it if you would circulate this letter to the WCPFC members during your annual meeting in Tahiti

WCPFC6-2009-OP09,5,IUCN would like to express our appreciation on being permitted to attend this 6th session of WCPFC as an observer We are delighted to report that since the 5th session held in Busan last year IUCN has two additional state members Fiji and Nauru This brings the total number of IUCN state members that are also members of the WCPFC to eight with Australia China Korea Japan New Zealand and United States
WCPFC6-2009-OP09,6,The mission of IUCN is to influence encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve the integrity and diversity of nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable IUCN has been active in the Oceania region for more than 20 years working through its members scientific and technical commissions The IUCN Regional Programme Office for Oceania was established in Suva in 2007 to allow IUCN to focus additional efforts on the Pacific Region This has resulted in the Pacific Ocean 2020 Initiative building upon the Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy working towards a healthy sustainable and productive Pacific Ocean by 2020
WCPFC6-2009-OP09,7,For this session of the WCPFC IUCN is particularly concerned about a number of issues At the last Commission meeting it was agreed that a reduction in catch of bigeye tuna of 30 from to 2004 levels was required to maintain the spawning biomass at the MSY level To try and achieve this specific conservation and management measures CMMs were agreed starting in 2009 However the Scientific Committee SC this year reported that there was actually an increase in bigeye catch of 6 in 2008 This means even greater reductions are now required to achieve the required result At the SC meeting it was also reported that the CMM that was agreed to at WCPFC5 will not achieve the required reduction Therefore more effective measures need
WCPFC6-2009-OP09,8,to be agreed at this meeting There are also a number of CMMs before the commission which address the impacts of pelagic fisheries in the WCPO on turtles sharks and seabirds IUCN hopes that heads of delegations at this commission meeting agree to apply CMMs that can achieve the required catch reduction in bigeye tuna and minimize mortality of these key bycatch species
WCPFC6-2009-OP09,9,IUCN believes there are two relatively simple measures that can reduce fishing capacity in the region and help achieve the desired results The first measure is a removal of all fishing subsidies by the governments of the major fishing nations which allow their fishing fleets to fish profitably here in the Pacific Many of these vessels would not be able to afford to fish in this region if they had to pay the real costs of fishing so far from their home port The second measure is to close the four high seas pockets as is being proposed at this meeting effectively making these High Seas Marine Protected Areas This will help reduce the fishing effort by illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing vessels which use these areas as a refuge
WCPFC6-2009-OP09,10,IUCN would also like to draw the attention of the meeting to the recently released documentary film End of the Line This film raises the need for taking concrete and urgent steps forward if we are to save our fisheries It is hoped that an opportunity will arise for this film to be screened here at this meeting

WCPFC7-2010-OP02,2,Dear WCPFC Member Participating Territory Cooperating Nonmember or Observer
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,3,I am writing on behalf of the Pew Environment Group in regards to the discussions that will take place at the upcoming 7th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Commission WCPFC in Honolulu Hawaii As the newest and largest RFMO responsible for managing highly migratory fish stocks the WCPFC has the ability to apply current bestpractice in fisheries management so that tuna sharks and other fisheries under its remit are assured a well managed future and can thus continue to provide income and benefits to the countries of the Pacific
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,4,However we believe that for this to happen all members cooperating nonmembers and participating territories CCMs must ensure that WCPFC decision making does not follow the same path as other RFMOs in other regions This 7th Regular Session offers an opportunity to ensure strong Conservation and Management Measures CMMs are in place and effectively implemented implement scientifically sound precautionary measures to protect the ecological and economic viability of tuna and shark populations and the ecosystems on which they depend and ensure that progress is made toward implementation of port State measures to reduce and eventually eliminate illegal unregulated and unreported IUU fishing

WCPFC7-2010-OP02,21,Executive Summary The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC is the newest and largest Regional Fisheries Management Organization RFMO responsible for managing highly migratory fish stocks It arguably is the best equipped to create a sustainable future for a large proportion of the worlds commercial fish populations Given its more modern and comprehensive mandate the WCPFC has the ability to apply current international best practices in fisheries management so that the tuna sharks and other fisheries under its remit do not follow the same path as those managed by RFMOs in other regions WCPFC can instead chart a course towards a sustainable future Members cooperating nonmembers and participating territories CCMs involved in the development of bilateral treaties related to fisheries access in the Convention Area must ensure that any such treaties are complementary to and supportive of strong sciencebased management with appropriate limits and enforcement measures The WCPFC has an opportunity at this 7th Regular Session to ensure the implementation of strong and effective conservation management measures CMMs These measures should be scientifically sound and precautionary and should protect the ecological and economic viability of tuna and shark populations and the ecosystems on which they depend Specifically the Pew Environment Group recommends that WCPFC takes the actions outlined below To help ensure the conservation of shark populations
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,22,Prohibit purse seine vessels from setting nets around whale sharks a species classified by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN as Vulnerable to extinction

WCPFC7-2010-OP02,32,To help ensure the conservation of tuna populations
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,33,Manage stocks with a higher degree of precaution particularly bigeye tuna given high uncertainty with regard to recruitment levels1 As a precautionary action measures should be implemented to reduce fishing mortality of bigeye by at least 39 from 20052008 levels in order to include a 10 precautionary buffer on top of the 29 reduction proposed by the Scientific Committee at its 6th Regular Session SC6
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,34,Further extend the fish aggregating device FAD closure and fully enforce it Significantly extend the FAD closure to ensure increased effectiveness or establish a limit on the number of total FAD sets allowed throughout the year based on advice from the Scientific Committee Implement reporting and monitoring provisions and keep them under active review
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,35,Identify and correct noncompliance particularly for negligent or late data reporting A lack of timely data provision continues to hamper the ability of the Scientific Committee to provide the highest quality management recommendations To address illegal unregulated and unreported IUU fishing
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,36,Seek to improve WCPFC port State Measures PSMs with the goal of bringing them into line with the recently adopted Port State Measures Agreement PSMAii By adopting an improved PSM regime WCPFC CCMs not only would reduce IUU fishing in the WCPFC Area but would also support global efforts to close ports to all IUU fishing vessels
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,37,Encourage WCPFC CCMs to sign and ratify the PSMA as soon as possible
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,38,Require fishing and support vessels authorized to operate in the Convention Area to have a unique IMO International Maritime Organization number to allow the identification and tracking of these vessels

WCPFC7-2010-OP02,42,Overcoming Challenges Towards Sustainability
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,43,The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission was established by the Convention for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean and entered into force on June 19 2004 The WCPFC aims to ensure the longterm conservation and sustainable use of highly migratory fish stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean while also reflecting the unique social economic and geographic characteristics of the region Mirroring many of the provisions of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement UNFSA iii the WCPFC has a mandate to use precautionary and ecosystembased approaches to management to make decisions based on the best scientific information available and to minimize bycatch and protect biodiversity The WCPFC is the newest and largest RFMO responsible for managing highly migratory fish stocks and arguably is the bestequipped to create a sustainable future for a large proportion of the worlds commercial fish populations Accounting for nearly 20 of the earths surface the WCPFC is responsible for management of the worlds largest tuna fishery and important populations of sharks as well as marine turtles and many other commercially and ecologically important species With almost 60 of the worlds tuna originating from the waters of the western and central Pacific2 tunas are critical to the livelihoods of Pacific peoples and States The developing countries of the Pacific whose waters are home to these species should receive equitable benefits from the sustainable harvesting of fish In addition they need capacity building support to facilitate sustainable management and enforcement capabilities In this regard the effects of IUU fishing in particular unregulated fishing and the underreporting of catch also need to be addressed At the global level despite efforts by the 18 RFMOs and individual States to manage fisheries a peerreviewed evaluation of RFMO performance determined that twothirds of stocks fished on the high seas and under RFMO management are either depleted or overexploited3 Similarly according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization FAO In the case of straddling stocks and of other high seas fishery resources nearly twothirds of the stocks for which the state of exploitation can be determined were classified as overexploited or depleted4 Further more than onehalf of the shark species taken in high seas fisheries are classified by the IUCN Red List as iii UN Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea of Dec10 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks Entered into force on Dec 11 2001 wwwunorgDeptslosconventionagreementsconventionoverviewfishstockshtm and httpwwwecolexorg Pacific Island Fisheries are the major renewable resource available to the region for food security livelihoods and economic growth Despite considerable progress in fisheries management and development many of these fisheries face collapse over the next 25 years and major development opportunities will be missed unless strategic action is taken The Future of the Pacific Island Fisheries httpsspcintfamedoccorporatedocsFutureofPIfisheriesBrochurepdf FINDING SUSTAINABILITY
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,44,Threatened or Near Threatened These data confirm that RFMOs are not sustainably managing the high seas fisheries for which the global community holds them accountable The challenge to the WCPFC is to defy this trend and chart a course towards a sustainable future Given its more modern and comprehensive mandate the WCPFC has the ability to apply current international best practice in fisheries management so that the tuna sharks and other fisheries under its remit do not follow the same path as those managed by RFMOs in other regions In this regard the WCPFC has an opportunity in 2010 to ensure that strong and effective CMMs are in place and effectively implemented by CCMs It also has the opportunity to implement scientifically sound precautionary measures to protect the ecological and economic viability of tuna and shark populations and the ecosystems on which they depend Many member countries of the WCPFC have been operating under bilateral and multilateral access agreements with one or more Parties to the Nauru Agreement PNA to ensure access for their tuna fleets Some of these agreements are being renegotiated as we speak While some of these agreements could contain more effective conservation measures than have been agreed by the Commission others could contain measures that would be obstacles to progress by the Commission It is important that access agreements are not obstacles to the agreement or implementation of conservation and management measures Sustainability must be mainstreamed into all access agreements In order to increase the effectiveness of the WCPFC and its primary role of managing and conserving tuna and other fisheries under its remit the Pew Environment Group encourages the Commission to integrate these agreements into the Commissions processes In this regard we would encourage parties to consider including provisions from the PSMA and a greater attention to the conservation and management of sharks both in these access agreements and the WCPFC provisions as a whole At this 7th Regular Session of the WCPFC there are opportunities to create a new era of sustainability Although the capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change challenge these opportunities the adoption of strong precautionary conservation and management measures by WCPFC CCMs can help mitigate these challenges This Session provides a launching point for regional progress and longterm strategic action which can be achieved only through strong political commitments with effective implementation thereafter This document sets out the Pew Environment Groups recommended actions on 1 critical conservation management actions needed for sharks 2 tuna conservation and 3 reduction of IUU fishing We look forward to providing scientific and technical information and working closely with States to help ensure sustainable legal fisheries and healthy populations of tunas sharks and other species for the benefit of all
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,45,FINDING SUSTAINABILITY Conservation Measures Needed to Protect Sharks 1 Sharks Need Attention Now Sharks caught in high seas fisheries are among the oceans most vulnerable animals Their low reproductive rates make them particularly susceptible to overfishing in the face of increased demand for shark products Up to 73 million sharks are killed annually to support the global shark fin trade5 More than onehalf of the shark species taken in high seas fisheries are classified by the IUCN Red List as Threatened or Near Threatened6 In 2010 the international community focused much attention on the plight of sharks In March at the th meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species CITES Conference of the Parties four Appendix II listing proposals narrowly missed receiving the number of votes required to give these species the protections to help ensure sustainable international trade In May the resumed Review Conference of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement called on countries to implement fins naturally attached provisions However as 2010 draws to a close there are still virtually no international limits on high seas shark catches and loopholes still hamper the enforcement of international prohibitions on finning the wasteful and cruel practice of slicing off a sharks fins and discarding the body at sea As sharks are among the most biologically vulnerable fish in the ocean and little is currently known about their population status the Pew Environment Group believes shark fishing should not occur in the absence of scientific population assessments and precautionary management plans Further WCPFC and its CCMs should prohibit the landing of exceptionally biologically vulnerable sharks as well as those that that the IUCN classifies as Threatened or Near Threatened with extinction by the IUCN Ecological risk assessments can inform those measures in the absence of stock assessments Finally sharks are essential to the health of ocean ecosystems and the economies of countries including those that offer marine recreation such as diving and snorkeling For these reasons coastal countries should consider creating shark sanctuaries where no commercial shark fishing is permittedto protect sharks in their exclusive economic zones EEZs 2 Shark Bycatch Part of the Problem According to the IUCN bycatch is one of the most devastating threats facing sharks At the Kobe II Bycatch Workshop7 earlier this year participants supported presenting a number of recommendations to RFMOs for sharks and other bycatch species The recommendations include the following Photo credit Toddessickcom FINDING SUSTAINABILITY
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,46,For populations of concern including those evaluated as depleted RFMOs should develop and adopt immediate effective management measures for example prohibition as appropriate on retention of such species where alternative effective sustainability measures are not in place
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,47,RFMOs should seek binding measures or strengthen existing mitigation measures including the development of mandatory reporting requirements for bycatch across all gear types and fishing methods where bycatch is a concern
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,48,Due to the conservation status of certain populations and in accordance with priorities in the RFMO areas RFMOs should expedite action on reducing bycatch of threatened and endangered species Whether unintended unwanted or highly sought after shark bycatch and the impact of shark removals on ecosystem stability needs urgent attention 3 Action Needed From WCPFC The WCPFC has taken initial action to conserve Pacific sharks including CMM 200904 which mandates that vessels adhere to a 5 fintocarcass weight ratio for sharks and encourages the live release of incidental catches of sharks among other useful measures However stronger more meaningful conservation measures are needed now by WCPFC and its CCMs to ensure that targeted fishing as well as bycatch does not deplete shark species and drive them toward extinction The WCPFC and its CCMs should adopt and implement guidelines from the Pacific Islands Regional Plan of Action for sharks PIRPOA which was completed in October 2009 by the Forum Fisheries Agency FFA the Secretariat of the Pacific Community SPC and the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme SPREP The PIRPOA provides guidance to Pacific Island Countries and Territories as well as the WCPFC on the conservation and management of sharks Specifically the Pew Environment Group recommends that CCMs adopt the following measures to help ensure the conservation of shark populations under WCPFCs management purview
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,49,Prohibit purse seine vessels from setting nets around whale sharks a species the IUCN classified as Vulnerable to extinction
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,50,Approve the Shark Research Plan and the associated budget to determine the status of key shark species

WCPFC7-2010-OP02,57,Prohibit the dumping of carcasses after landing FINDING SUSTAINABILITY A Return to Healthy Tuna Stocks 1 FADs and Juvenile Bigeye Bycatch The most significant threat to sustainability in the WCPFC tuna fisheries is the inability of the purse seine fishery to significantly reduce the mortality of juvenile bigeye tuna when setting on floating objects Provisional bigeye tuna catches of 118675 metric tons mt exceeded the maximum sustainable yield MSY of 840 mt by 618 Extreme overfishing is now occurring and the stock may already be in an overfished state Additionally the spawning potential of bigeye tuna is now down to of unfished levels9 As in other RFMOs it appears that management advice is being repeatedly ignored while the status of the stocks spirals towards collapse A number of recommendations on tuna shark and other bycatch species management were supported by participants in the Kobe II Bycatch Workshops to present to RFMOs The challenge of juvenile bigeye bycatch is clearly a concern shared by CCMs as evidenced by the amount of research on potential solutions In the past year alone research on acoustic identification techniques underwater monitoring systems escape panels and light stimuli has been undertaken by a variety of CCMs but no conclusive solutions have been identified Although more research will always be needed significant action must be taken immediately to alleviate fishing pressure on this imperiled stock based on what is known today There is one very simple and effective solution that can be immediately implemented Reduce juvenile bigeye bycatch to a level that will stop overfishing and allow the stocks to begin to rebuild Based on the results presented at the last Scientific Committee SC6 on the effectiveness of the FAD closure on reducing juvenile bycatch10 the Pew Environment Group urges WCPFC countries to agree to significantly extend FAD closures or to establish a limit on the number of FAD sets allowed throughout the year in order to ensure a reduction in juvenile bigeye bycatch These should be accompanied by robust reporting and monitoring provisions so that the Commission has access to meaningful data on bycatch the number of FADs being employed and the frequency and results of fishing on FADs This information should be actively reviewed 2 Fishing Beyond MSY To ensure that WCPFC does not mirror the decades of mismanagement seen in at least one other tuna RFMO it is critical that WCPFC countries reach agreement on how to effectively reduce capacity to a level in line with the sustainable take of tuna resources in the Convention Area Photo credit C M Fallows SeaPics FINDING SUSTAINABILITY
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,58,Information from the WCPFC Scientific Committee indicates that skipjack purse seine catches continue to soar In 2009 purse seine catches were approximately 500000 metric tons mt beyond the longterm MSY of 1350000mta record tonnage for the region11See Table 1 Likewise the effort that this record number of vessels exerts on the resource already exceeds the longterm sustainable take for skipjack The complex problem of overcapacity is a challenge that WCPFC countries must tackle immediately before fishing pressure on the skipjack fishery reaches dangerous levels Further purse seine fisherys high level of bigeye bycatch is a primary factor in driving the bigeye population towards collapse It must be noted also that MSY is now widely recognized as an absolute minimum below which fishing should not continue The Pew Environment Group urges CCMs to modify CMM200801 to reflect the most recent science from the SPC and to put precautionary caps on catches of all tuna species until scientifically sound limit and target reference points have been identified 3 High Seas Pocket Closures The High Seas Closures to Purse Seine Fishing Vessels as proposed by the PNA provide a clear and concrete opportunity for the WCPFC to follow scientific advice through precautionary measures thereby conserving tuna and other species and combating IUU fishing The PNA proposal follows advice from the Scientific Committee on the need for additional measures to conserve bigeye tuna see further below Keeping the existing areas closed and closing these additional areas to fishing not only provides protection for marine life between the rich fishing grounds of the surrounding EEZs it also helps stop IUU fishing and reduce the problem of additional invisible overfishing efforts These closures reinforce other efforts by the WCPFC for the conservation and management of important tuna and other fish in the Convention Area as well as helping ensure that Pacific Island Countries are not cheated out of income as fish caught within EEZs may be falsely disguised as high seas catch to avoid payment of access fees The Pew Environment Group encourages CCMs to support the additional closures proposed by the PNA 4 Regional Tuna Fisheries and Climate Change Among its myriad impacts climate change has the potential to impact regional tuna fisheries in major ways by shifting species distribution productivity and abundance raising average ocean surface temperatures changing the productivity of the oceans changing currents and upwellings and increasing climate variabilityiv Although research is ongoing there are indications that the adverse impacts of climate change on tuna fisheries will be pervasive Given the importance of tuna fisheries to the CCMs and the potential adverse effects of climate change on this resource it is of critical importance that a precautionary approach is taken and strong conservation and management measures are adopted 5 Action Needed From WCPFC Specifically the Pew Environment Group recommends that CCMs adopt the following measures to help ensure the conservation of tuna populations under WCPFCs management purview iv See for instance DEJ Currie and K Wowk Climate Change and CO2 in the Oceans and Global Oceans Governance Improving Governance of the Worlds Oceans 4 CCLR 2009 387 and Allison Perry et al Climate change and distribution shifts in marine fishes 308 Science 2005 1912 FINDING SUSTAINABILITY

implement the UN Port State Measures Agreement which once in force will close ports to vessels involved in IUU fishing The Port State Measures Agreement Implementation Toolkit Ports play a major role in the fishing industry They give vessels and crews access to essential services and supplies and enable vessel operators to offload their catch and transport it to market However ports can also provide a lifeline for illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing an activity that undermines the very essence of global ocean governance threatens the sustainable use of marine resources and consequently the social and economic wellbeing of the coastal communities and countries that depend on them The United Nations Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing Port State Measures Agreement or PSMA adopted in November 2009 by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization FAO is an ambitious international agreement that aims to stop the use of ports by IUU fishing and support vessels It provides port States with a set of highly costeffective measures that when implemented globally and effectively will ensure that a countrys ports are closed to IUU fishing fleets For this to be possible particularly in the ports of developing countries a comprehensive set of tools is needed to support the practical implementation of the Agreement As part of its commitment to improve ocean governance the Pew Environment Group is developing the PSMA Implementation Toolkit The toolkit aims to help developing countries identify their capacity needs provide them with key information and guide them through the most technical and detailed elements of the Agreement The toolkit is an open and evolving set of practical materials developed using ontheground experience Input from potential users is a key element of the toolkits evolution To achieve this we encourage collaboration with national and regional authorities in the ongoing development of these materials The first tools in the toolkit Capacity Needs Assessment Methodology Implementation of the PSMA requires an adequate welltrained fisheries inspectorate that has good levels of communication and coordination between domestic agencies such as customs and port authorities and cooperates with relevant regional and global bodies In collaboration with the Nordenfjeldske Development Services NFDS the New Partnership for Africas Development NEPAD and six African countries the Pew Environment Group has developed a simple and robust methodology that can be used to determine a countrys specific capacitybuilding needs The methodology also provides a platform for the development of a capacity building plan which when implemented would ensure that the country has adequate capacity to comply with its obligations under the PSMA The full Capacity Needs Assessment methodology report is available at wwwpewenvironmentorgIUUfishing The PSMA Implementation Handbook The PSMA is an extensive instrument that provides a new set of technical measures to be implemented at the domestic and international levels This requires greater coordination among countries increased capacity in all relevant agencies fisheries customs ports etc and in many cases new procedures for decisionmaking vessel inspections and reporting domestically to flag States and internationally The Pew Environment Group in collaboration with experts in the field and government authorities is currently producing the PSMA implementation handbook The handbook will translate the PSMAs technical and legal text into clear and practical tools to help government agencies and their enforcement personnel implement the Agreement effectively The PSMA implementation handbook will be available in early 2011 Combined IUU Vessel Database IUU operators are skilled at disguising and hiding their activities and often remain undetected by port authorities The Pew Environment Groups research on Port State Performance documented some alarming situations in apparently wellregulated ports As called for in Article 16 of the PSMA a global informationsharing mechanism is essential if domestic regional and international authorities are to keep track of IUU activities As a first contribution the Pew Environment Group has developed the combined IUU vessel database which draws together all publicly available information on IUU vessels officially listed by Regional Fishery Management Organizations On launch the database will provide an uptodate resource that will enhance informationsharing among relevant officials The list will be made available to the International Monitoring Control and Surveillance IMCS Network which will host and maintain it The Combined IUU vessels database will be available in early 2011 The Port State Performance Research can be found at wwwportstateperformanceorg To find out more about the PSMA implementation toolkit please contact Adriana Fabra AFabraconsultant pewtrustsorg The Pew Environment Group has conducted a gap analysis comparing the port State measures PSMs established by 10 Regional Fisheries Management Organizations RFMOs with those established by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing PSMA or Agreement The research assesses the extent to which measures adopted by these RFMOs meet the PSMAs standards and identifies those aspects which need to be further developed by each RFMO in order that their measures become aligned with the Agreements The newly adopted PSMA represents an international minimum standard on PSMs and provides a unique opportunity to harmonise and strengthen Port State controls globally RFMOs have a special role to play in this process and specifically in helping to combat illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing on the high seas This document presents the preliminary findings of this gap analysis for WCPFC based on information that was publicly available up to 31 July 2010 We invite WCPFCs Contracting Parties CPs to assist in refining this analysis by commenting on the information provided and providing additional information where appropriate The preliminary aim of this exercise is to identify specific gaps in WCPFCs conservation and management measures in relation to the PSMA and make clear recommendations to WCPFC for improvement The longterm aim is to provide information to States and RFMOs to help eliminate IUU fishing A full report on this study with specific conclusions and recommendations for each of the RFMOs analysed will be released early in 2011 Gap analysis Comparing WCPFCs port State measures with those in the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing PRELIMINARY FINDINGS In November 2009 the FAO adopted the PSMA providing a set of highly effective tools to be used by port States to combat IUU fishing such as the designation of ports where foreign vessels may request entry the prohibition of entry into port the prohibition of landing the prohibition of transshipping and the refusal of other port services to IUU fishing vessels the carrying out of inspections in port and the adoption of enforcement measures The Pew Environment Group strongly supports the earliest possible entry into force of the Agreement and welcomes the fact that 15 States and the European Union have signed it The PSMA establishes the current international minimum standard on PSMs targeting IUU fishing which should be followed by States even prior to the Agreements official entry into force In addition to each States individual efforts to ratify the Agreement steps should be taken within the framework of RFMOs to ensure that PSMs adopted in the regional context are adjusted to meet the new international minimum standard PSMs will only be truly effective in combating IUU fishing if they are enforced in a uniform manner globally RFMOs and the PSMA can reinforce each other Not only are RFMOs essential to the effective implementation of the PSMA in a regional context but the PSMA if implemented by a critical number of States can support the role of RFMOs by improving overall compliance with RFMO conservation and management measures RichaRd caReyFotolia ThE PoRT STATE MEASuRES AGREEMENT AND RFMoS Preliminary findings of this research indicate that the PSMs of most RFMOs have not yet reached the standard contained in the PSMA Most importantly RFMOs have not comprehensively covered all IUU fishing activity their PSMs are not sufficiently effective in deterring the IUU operators and their requirements on transparency and information sharing are inadequate In general the study finds that there are several aspects of port State controls that are especially under regulated through RFMO regimes such as the denial of port entry refusal of port services and minimum standards for inspections Full implementation of the PSMA by States and RFMOs will significantly increase the feasibility of truly combating IUU fishing ibon baRandika UgaRtetxe ShiPSPottingcoM WCPFC While this is a qualitative and not quantitative scale and methodology it does provide a useful tool for comparative analyses between RFMOs and for an independent analysis of individual RFMOs The study shows that RFMO measures are rarely an exact match of a PSMA provision However a comparison of the measures in place in the different regimes enables both general and specific conclusions about the current state of development of PSMs at the regional level We are aware that RFMOs have their own particularities and face challenges that make their regulatory systems including PSMs different from each other However in analysing PSMs developed by 10 different RFMOs we have tried to keep our analysis as objective as possible focusing on the degree of conformity of such rules with the PSMA It is undeniable that IUU fishing on the high seas is a common challenge for all RFMOs The more the RFMOs apply a common standard on PSMs the better they will be able to face this challenge The comparison conducted under this analysis indicates the principal steps that RFMOs should take if they are to reach the international minimum standard provided by the PSMA Undertaking a gap analysis what is missing from RFMO rules The study conducted by the Pew Environment Group focuses on 10 RFMOs that have adopted regulations currently in force and published that include some form of PSM1
WCPFC7-2010-OP02,72,In order to compare the measures adopted by each of the reviewed RFMOs with the PSMAs measures a review of the Agreement including its annexes was conducted and its provisions deconstructed into more than 100 obligations Subsequently all potentially relevant RFMO measures were reviewed and those that contain PSMs applicable to fishing or fishingrelated activities were compared obligation by obligation with the obligations provided by the PSMA In order to assess the alignment between RFMO measures and those contained in the PSMA we have taken into account the objective pursued by the PSMA obligation the effect of each RFMO measure in its regulatory context and the clarity of the RFMO measures analysed To facilitate communicating the results of this research we have systematised our conclusions under a number of PSM categories These categories correspond closely to the main parts of the PSMA scope cooperation and informationsharing portdesignation and priortoentry information denial of entry and port use inspections and the role of the flag State To illustrate the alignment between RFMO measures and the PSMAs we have allocated a grade from 0 to 10 showing our assessment of the degree of conformity on each measure See Figure 1 for a representation of preliminary results for These are Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources CCAMLR Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna CCSBT General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean GFCM InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ICCAT Indian Ocean Tuna Commission IOTC Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization NAFO North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission NEAFC South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation SEAFO Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC According to the WCPF Convention port States have the right and the duty to take measures to promote the effectiveness of subregional regional and global conservation and management measures However the Commission has yet to adopt any CMM establishing a comprehensive system of port State controls to prevent deter and eliminate IUU fishing Structure and scope According to art 27 of the WCPFC Convention2a port State has the right and the duty to take measures to promote the effectiveness of subregional regional and global conservation and management measures However there is not one single CMM that provides coverage of all port State controls Thus far the Commission has adopted a number of CMMs containing some PSMs that regulate specific situations3 but a comprehensive and systematic approach to PSMs is lacking With one exception WCPFC does not exclude domestic vessels from the application of PSMs although the PSMA does4 Although WCPFCs PSMs apply to carrier and support vessels its definition of fishing does not include some of the fishingrelated activities mentioned by the PSMA thus setting a more limited standard than the Agreement5 The PSMA incorporates the definition of IUU fishing provided by paragraph 3 of the International Plan of Action to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing IPOAIUU WCPFC expressly refers to this definition of IUU fishing in the context of its CMM for IUUlisted vessels However the Conventions more general provision to deny landing and transshipment in port only refers to situations of non compliance with CMMs and not to IUU fishing broadly6 As a result of all this WCPFCs PSMs have a narrower scope than those contained in the PSMA Information exchangeinformation systems and cooperation WCPFC has developed several provisions on the need to cooperate with the FAO other RFMOs and in particular IATTC including cooperation on monitoring control and surveillance measures7 There is also a partial recognition of IUU vessel lists adopted by other RFMOs since vessels listed by any RFMO will be removed from the WCPFC register of authorised carrier vessels8 Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean

the WCPFC Convention See also CMM 20090122 CMM 20090137 Information pertinent to WCPFCs lists of authorised vessels is to be transmitted electronically These lists and WCPFCs IUU vessel lists are available online at WCPFCs website9 These obligations are consistent with the PSMA provisions that require port States to establish communication mechanisms that allow for direct electronic exchange of information mainly art 16 and Annex D However WCPFC does not establish obligations to notify relevant parties of actions taken at port such as denial of port use or the results of port inspection10 These obligations are essential for the effectiveness of PSMs and have been developed in detail by the PSMA Designation and capacity of ports Under WCPFC rules a Member may notify the Executive Director of its designated ports for transshipments The Executive Director will periodically circulate the list of designated ports to all Members11 However there are no provisions requiring Members to use designated ports for transshipments Furthermore there is no regulation of designation of ports for uses other than transshipment or to ensure that ports of WCPFC Members have the required capacity to conduct inspections Priortoentry information According to the PSMA port States shall require vessels to provide a minimum set of information described in Annex A prior to entry with sufficient time to allow for port State authorities to examine the information WCPFC does not have any requirements to provide information prior to entry Denial of entry except for inspection and effective action One of the central obligations of the PSMA is the denial of entry into port to IUU fishing and support vessels except for the purposes of inspecting and taking other actions against these vessels these actions need to be as effective as denial of entry in deterring IUU fishing WCPFC CMMs do not require Members to deny entry to IUU fishing vessels However in the case of IUUlisted vessels CMMs require Members to inspect all such vessels and to not authorise them to land transship refuel or resupply Since WCPFC does not require Members to take other actions against these vessels and does not prohibit other port services such as repairing and drydocking this provision sets a slightly lower standard than the PSMAs in relation to IUUlisted vessels In addition this provision does not apply any port restrictions to other nonlisted IUU vessels contrary to what is required by the Agreement12 Port use The PSMA requires port States to deny use of ports including access to port services of any kind to vessels engaged in IUU fishing Under WCFPC measures Members shall not allow IUUlisted vessels to land CMM 20070323 and CMM 20090113 See arts 113 and 15 of the PSMA Art 291 of the WCPFC Convention CMM 2009065 CMM 20070322 b WCPFC should urgently develop standards for conducting inspections and require port States to inspect vessels even if they are not IUUlisted require vessels to provide information prior to entry into ports and mandate States to notify relevant parties of all actions taken at port PRELIMINARY FINDINGS oN WCPFCS PSMS AND ThEIR ALIGNMENT WITh ThE PSMA transship refuel or resupply but there is no reference to denying other port services included in the PSMA13 In addition to its measures against IUUlisted vessels WCPFC prohibits landings and transshipments from vessels not included on the WCPFCs lists of authorised vessels14 and from vessels that do not have the required license from a coastal State15 There are also species specific prohibitions of landings and transshipments16 Inspections Under WCPFC rules Members are only required to inspect IUUlisted vessels thus covering a very limited category of vessels when compared with the PSMA In addition WCPFC has not developed rules about how inspections should be conducted Although Annex III of the Convention gives some guidance on conducting transshipment inspections including transshipment in port17 WCPFC has not yet developed any measure requiring Members to inspect vessels transshipping in port Finally WCPFC has not developed any guidelines on the training of port inspectors as required by the PSMA art 17 and Annex E Flag States Art 20 of the PSMA includes a set of flag State obligations Arts 96 and 111 of the PSMA also prohibit packaging processing maintenance and drydocking to these vessels WCPFC has a Record of Fishing Vessels and an Interim Register of Non Member Carrier and Bunker Vessels authorised to fish and operate in the Convention Area beyond national jurisdictions CMM 200901 CMM 2009014 c 16 and 17 These prohibitions apply to shark fins CMM 2009049 and tuna products CMM 200801 42 Art 42 and Annex II of the Convention For more information please contact Adriana Fabra AFabraConsultantpewtrustsorg wwwPewEnvironmentorgIUUfishing designed to facilitate the implementation of PSMs The Agreement also requires flag States to take action against a vessel when an inspection report indicates that the vessel was involved in IUU fishing The WCPFC Convention includes provisions requiring flag States to fully investigate any alleged violation by fishing vessels flying its flag upon reception of relevant information and to take action against such vessels18 Although these obligations are rather prescriptive they do not make any reference to port inspections Since there is no obligation under WCPFC to transmit port inspection reports to the flag State these flag State obligations are not likely to be realised under WCPFC

WCPFC7-2010-OP04,1,WWF TRAFFIC STATEMENT TO WCPFC 7 Regular Session Honolulu Hawaii 6 10 December 2010
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,2,Introduction
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,3,Recognizing that the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFCis now in its seventh year of existence WWF and TRAFFIC believe that the time for significant action is urgently overdue in collectively agreeing to and implementing conservation and management measures for the sustainable exploitation of the Pacifics tuna resources and associated bycatch
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,4,WWF and TRAFFIC recognize and applaud the significant efforts that the Parties to the Nauru Agreement PNA have instigated with regard to management reform within their respective Exclusive Economic Zones EEZs WWF and TRAFFIC support many of these initiatives that begin the journey toward sustainable tuna resources within the region However the concern over the decline in bigeye tuna in particular is not yet fully reflected in the management decisions that have been taken or translated into fishing behavior that can be considered responsible or sustainable for this species The WCPFC will be judged as to its competency on the basic facts of whether it has enacted in a timely manner meaningful management measures that contain fishing effort within sustainable limits While some believe seven years is a short time for a management regime to show achievement we believe the honeymoon is over the WCPFC needs to show measurable achievements and the performance review needs to be prioritized to help guide positive action for the future
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,5,WWF and TRAFFIC consider that the WCPFC needs to improve its performance to ensure the sustainable management of tuna stocks within its mandate This means adopting truly precautionary conservation measures that are based on precautionary limit and target reference points for tuna stocks Furthermore the WCPFC needs to adopt comprehensive and consistent best practices to mitigate bycatch associated with tuna fishing and as a basic requirement not allow for the setting of purse seine nets associated with marine mammals or whale or basking sharks There are a number of underlying issues that WCPFC needs to address in order to strengthen the platform for effective management of both bycatch and target species including
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,6,Mandating the submission of bycatch data by members and cooperating nonmembers In the absence of reliable data and hence in an environment of uncertainty about the
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,7,nature and extent of the bycatch problem a more precautionary approach to management is required
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,8,Developing science based observer programmes with clearly specified objectives that o validate data submitted o are designed to provide statistically robust estimates of the extent of bycatch by species across the temporal and spatial distribution of the fleet and o allow for observers to play a role in monitoring the implementation of bycatch mitigation measures Adopting ecological risk assessment as a means to ensure that available scientific and management resources are targeted to the most vulnerable species Implementing effective means of monitoring compliance with all aspects of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs by individual members Introducing a system of stringent penalties for failure to comply with those CMMs in particular failure to comply with data submission bycatch and target species requirements
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,9,Bigeye and Yellowfin tuna The purse seine fishery catch of bigeye BET and yellowfin YFT tuna is comprised mainly of juveniles of these species well below both the size of first reproduction and that which would maximize yield per recruit As a result the impacts of associated purse seine sets on BET and YFT are out of proportion with catches Molony 2007 Associated purse seine sets are estimated to have been responsible for reducing the total biomass of BET by more than 20 and of YFT by more than 10 Molony 2007 Harley et al 2010 conclude that the purse seine and other surface fisheries have an equal or greater impact on the BET biomass than longline fisheries and that the purse seine and PhilippinesIndonesian domestic fisheries also have a substantial impact on region 3 and to a lesser extent region 4 The WCPFC has recognized that a reduction in the purse seine catch of juvenile BET and YFT is required to reduce the impact of the fishery on these stocks This is reflected in CMM 200801 but its effectiveness is questionable at best In addition to the WCPFC measures PNA members recognized in 2009 the serious impact on the bigeye stock from fishing by distant water longliners and purse seiners in the high seas and that the high seas continue to provide a safe haven for IUU fishing The PNA Group subsequently adopted the Koror Declaration in February 2010 which expressing concern about the status of BET and YFT and the increasing growth of capacity and effort in the region closed those additional high seas areas PNA 2010
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,10,Bigeye tuna In 2010 the Scientific Committee of the WCPFC concluded that overfishing is occurring in the bigeye stock but possibly at a lower level than previously estimated and approaching an overfished state if it is not already slightly overfished recent catches are well above the Maximum Sustainable Yield MSY level and the Committee concluded that current catch levels are unlikely to be sustainable in the longer term even the recent high levels of recruitment estimated for the last decade noted the continued high fishing mortality on juvenile bigeye due to associated purse seine sets and the fisheries of Indonesia and the Philippines recommended that a 29 reduction in fishing mortality from the average levels for 2005 2008 equivalent to a minimum 31 reduction in fishing mortality from the 2004 levels was required in order to return fishing mortality to MSY levels advised that the management measures for bigeye tuna established in 2008 for both the purse seine and longline fleets will not achieve the targeted reduction in fishing mortality
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,11,WWF and TRAFFIC believe that the effort reduction measures in place under the Vessel Day Scheme VDS and reflected in CMM 200801 are inadequate and that much greater reductions in vessel days are required in order to place BET on the path to sustainability Further should fishing effort from the closed high seas areas be transferred to archipelagic waters which are excluded from the CMM and further East additional pressure may be placed on BET WWF and TRAFFIC consider that the BET stock is not within biologically based limits and the management measures in place are considered unlikely to ensure recovery or rebuilding of the stock
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,12,Yellowfin tuna No new information on the stock status of YFT was presented to Scientific Committee 6 SC6 and therefore the Committee recommended that the management recommendations from the previous SC5 be maintained In 2009 the Scientific Committee advised that the YFT stock is not overfished and that overfishing is not occurring recommended that there be no increase in fishing mortality of YFT in the western equatorial region
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,13,WWF and TRAFFIC support the Scientific Committees recommendation to the Commission for BET in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPO to reduce fishing mortality by a minimum of 29 from the average levels for 2005 2008
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,14,WWF and TRAFFIC support the Scientific Committees recommendation to the Commission for YFT in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPO to limit YFT fishing mortality to its 2001 level
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,15,Reference points The WCPFC has not adopted formal reference points for any tuna or tuna related species under its management within the Convention area
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,16,In 2009 a special workshop on reference points was held by the WCPFC Scientific Committees Methods Specialist Working Group WWF and TRAFFIC understand that it was expected that the Scientific Committee would make recommendations on appropriate provisional limit reference points for the key target species to the WCPFC in 2010 The Commissions decisions on reference points will also take into account the outcomes of the Workshop on Management Objectives to be held in 2010 WWF and TRAFFIC notes however that reference points have been under consideration in the WCPFC since 2006 and it appears that this vital process has been delayed yet again for another year While it is now expected that the Scientific Committee may make recommendations to the Commission in 2011 on appropriate reference points there can be no certainty that this will not be delayed again or the Commission will formally adopt them As discussed above the WCPFC has not adopted formal limit or target reference points
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,17,WWF and TRAFFIC strongly urge the WCPFC to formally adopt target reference points WWF and TRAFFIC believe that the adoption of explicitly determined limit and target reference points for at least the four key tuna species is an absolute priority for the sustainable management of the resource
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,18,Harvest strategy Harvest control rules There are no explicit harvest control rules in the WCPFC Monitoring of the stocks is based on catch and effort data lengthfrequency and tagging data The current rudimentary harvest strategy employed in the WCPFC does not contain any harvest control rules and as such does not reflect best practice The primary management action involves limiting fishing effort via an array of input controls such as the PNAs VDS closure of high seas pockets FAD closures and implementation of capacity limits driven by concerns for BET and YFT
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,19,The Convention for the WCPFC includes default target and limit reference points and the management objective for all target stocks is to maintain stocks at or above MSYbased reference points The absence of harvest control rules that provide for immediate and effective action to reduce exploitation rates when and as required is a serious concern
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,20,While the WCPFC could argue that it is capable of implementing management action in response to scientific advice on stock status for example BET and YFT the effectiveness of this action is questionable and this underlines the importance of well defined harvest control rules to ensure timely and adequate management
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,21,WWF and TRAFFIC call on the WCPFC to adopt harvest control rules that are welldefined pre agreed and contain mandatory actions for an agreed and determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,22,Proposed Participation Fee WWF and TRAFFIC appreciates the concerns expressed by some member countries regarding ever increasing costs and budget demands associated with tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organization RFMO meetings However the proposal to introduce a participation or registration fee of US500 700 per delegate to cost recover observer attendance particularly Non Government Organizations NGOs and Civil Society Organizations CSOs at the Commission and its subsidiary meetings is iniquitous and misguided
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,23,NGOs and CSOs represent not just their respective organizations but the entire external general public providing an insight and voice for the broader community who are also key stakeholders concerned with the sustainable management and utilization of tuna and related marine resources For many the people they represent rely upon the sustainability of these resources for their daily livelihoods In this sense NGOs and CSOs provide significant benefits for governments industry and scientists in terms of education and awareness of resource issues and thus are essential to build trust and confidence within the general community and amongst consumers
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,24,If such a fee were to be introduced this would result in reduced and restricted participation by many NGOs and CSOs alike and an immediate eroding effect on the Commissions current open transparent and inclusive approach This would absolutely undermine the trust and confidence that the general community and consumers have in their governments representatives ability to be responsible stewards of the tuna resources
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,25,WWF and TRAFFIC strongly oppose any fee being introduced for the participation of NGOs or CSOs at any meeting concerning this RFMO
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,26,Regional Observer Program ROP There is no current impediment for all support vessels to have 100 observer coverage such as that currently in place on purse seine vessels while 100 observer coverage for longliners should be phased in WWF and TRAFFIC suggests the following timetable for a 3year phasein of 100 ROP coverage for all fishing vessels
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,27,o 2011 All support vessels resupply refueling reefers for all high seas fishing have 100 ROP coverage o 2011 20 of all longliners including at least one from each flag state have an ROP observer on board o 2012 50 of all longliners including more than half of all vessels from each flag state have an ROP observer on board o 2013 100 of all longliners have an ROP observer on board
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,28,WWF and TRAFFIC call for a comprehensive and strong Regional Observer Program with 100 coverage of all fishing vessels including both catching and support vessels
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,29,Catch Documentation Scheme WWF and TRAFFIC consider the failure to implement a catch documentation scheme CDS as a significant problem It is time for the WCPFC to take urgent action to address overfishing and to support and enforce that action by introducing a CDS WWF and TRAFFIC recognize that the introduction of a CDS will pose some challenges to the WCPFC given the nature of tuna fisheries However WCPFC needs to ensure that all fish stocks managed by this RFMO are subject to the CDS as a proactive precautionary measure WWF and TRAFFIC recommend that the WCPFC must Agree at its December 2010 meeting to adopt a CDS measure for at least the four1 key tuna species with a date of implementation starting from 1 July 2011 Implement a CDS that requires documentation to accompany all catch harvested landed transshipped traded domestically exported processed imported and reexported and which relies on electronic documentation The CDS should not exclude any catches landings or trade as is common in schemes which are trade based rather than catch document schemes One only has to look to the lessons learnt by the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna CCSBT which has switched from a trade based scheme to a CDS due to the trade scheme allowing for substantial over catches by one of its members as a result of the trade scheme not being inclusive of all catches landings or trade Ensure that complementary measures are in place to maximize the effectiveness of the CDS by ensuring that transshipment at sea does not compromise the effectiveness of the CDS adopting Port State measures consistent with global agreement to take effect at the same time as the tuna CDS and adopting measures that provide for traderestrictions to be used against flag States with vessels on the IUU list Acknowledge the need to implement CDS for other species of tunas billfish and sharks managed by the Commission Commit to continuous improvement of the CDS by investigating the benefits and feasibility of verification systems such as tagging and the use of biotechnology Establish a capacity development fund to act as a costsharing mechanism to enable for cross subsidising across wealthy and lesswealthy members to ensure effective implementation and administration of the CDS and Maximize retailer and public access to CDS data through modern online tools

WCPFC7-2010-OP04,31,Bycatch Conservation Management Measures WWF and TRAFFIC believe that WCPFC must take immediate management action to avoid bycatch interactions and to mitigate the impact of those interactions task the relevant scientificecosystem body to improve bycatch related information and strengthen the longterm management about bycatch levels and mitigation options review and revise management actions on bycatch as information increases and take action to strengthen their capacity to manage and monitor compliance with conservation and management measures
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,32,The recent Kobe II Bycatch workshop held in Australia produced a number of key outcomes including highlighting the need for urgent action and the insufficiency of available information to dictate the need for and underpin immediate management action emphasising that the tuna RFMOs must act to address bycatch across the five key taxonomic groups affected failing to identify best practice bycatch management techniques but instead recommending a set of principles for developing best practice bycatch avoidance and mitigation measures and most significantly recommending the formation of a Joint Tuna RFMO Technical Working Group TWG on Bycatch
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,33,The Technical Working Group TWG provides a unique opportunity to bring together experts to share the latest available information and develop coherent consistent and comprehensive measures to minimise and mitigate the impacts of tuna fisheries on bycatch species However there is no formal agreement to endorse and support the TWGs establishment and operation nor a proposed time frame for its work to be completed within Consequently and being aware of the need to maintain the momentum on this initiative a number of environmental NGOs including WWF and TRAFFIC have developed a Compendium best practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the bycatch species taxonomic groups Four CMMs please refer to bycatch Conservation and Management Measures document have been prepared on the basis of the best available scientific advice and taking into account current practice within tuna RFMOs The CMMs cover the following four taxonomic groups
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,34,Seabirds Sharks Sea turtles Marine mammals
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,35,WCPFC must take responsibility for species bycatch and act immediately This Compendium provides WCPFC with advice on the best practice precautionary measures that must be implemented on an interim basis pending the advice of the TWG These actions can be reviewed and revised to reflect that advice when it becomes available
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,36,WWF and TRAFFIC are calling for these CMMs to enter into force by 1 January in the year following adoption of the CMMs Further we call for the endorsement and urgent establishment of the Joint Tuna RFMO Technical Working Group on Bycatch by the tuna RFMOs These actions are required to demonstrate the commitment of the WCPFC to addressing bycatch impacts associated with their fisheries
WCPFC7-2010-OP04,37,CONCLUSION WWF and TRAFFIC call on the Commission to take the hard decisions now to prevent future fisheries collapse Scientists have been calling for large reductions in BET catch for over a decade Past performance of the Commission is at best slow to respond to such advice This wavering seriously jeopardises the commercial viability of the BET and YFT fishery in the WCPO into the future Effective management action must be adopted at this years Commission meeting If the Commission doesnt move fast to restore stocks and implement appropriate reference points and harvest strategies including moving toward rights based management regime it will directly impact the viability of the regions tuna fisheries and the economies of developing countries

Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission PO Box 2356 Kolonia Pohnpei 96941 Federated States of Micronesia Via EMail wcpfcwcpfcint Re WCPFC Consideration of IUU and BRPs issues Dear Commission Members On behalf of the Western Fishboat Owners Association WFOA I am writing to request the Commission to consider two items of importance to North American albacore fishermen A growing concern in our fisheries is evidence of growing IUU fishery that has potential to impair albacore production The second Item is the need to establishing the biological reference points being developed by the International Scientific Committees Albacore Working Group At WFOA meetings and on phone conversations my members bring up evidence of continuing IUU fishing along the North Pacific Transition Zone I would like to point out some of the IUU related observations that are coming to light in recent years North American trollers have observed illegal high seas gill net operations on several occasions and have notified authorities of the incidences This occurred this summer when US vessels notified authorities in Hawaii that resulted in an aircraft being sent to the sighting area but the response was delayed due to communication problems so the aircraft arrived on scene too late to locate any vessels I have photos on file of IUU vessels operating gillnets in the transition zone in 14 16 C surface temperature the preferred temperature of albacore The photos were taken by an albacore troll vessel engaged in trolling and catching albacore when it came upon the IUU vessel The growing number of gillnet marked albacore is of great concern Some of our fishermen that spend a great deal of time in the central Pacific estimate that 15 of the fish exhibit gillnet marks This suggests that the IUU take of albacore could be quite high since the 15 represent only fish that have escaped One fisherman reported finding a long panel of gillnet gear in the region of 43N 145W that was new and did not have any fouling or discoloration Reports from beach cleanup operations in Alaska show remnants of high seas drift gillnets come ashore in many locations in the Gulf of Alaska another indication of potentially high IUU effort in the North Pacific Ocean We note that the severe downturn in albacore abundance experienced in the late 1980s coincide with Page 1 of 3 the development of the high seas driftnet fishery Catches fell off steadily from about 1986 reaching a low in 1991 when US landed only 1900 tons After an international prohibition of large high seas nets the fishery recovered quickly to average levels by 1996 WFOA members are very concerned about illegal high seas fishing and the effect the on albacores sustainability On behalf of my members I request that the WCPFC and IATTC continue to work toward ending IUU fishing in the North Pacific Ocean Further I urge the WCPFC IATTC and coastal states to work together to develop an effective IUU monitoring and enforcement system WFOA and other North American fishermen feel strongly that it is futile to try to establish an effective management regime while a potentially significant portion of the catch is unaccounted for WFOA stands ready to assist through atsea observation of vessel activity and reporting of IUU gear Our second item of concern is the adoption of biological reference points for North Pacific fisheries WFOA recently received Marine Steward Council MSC certification for albacore landed by all US troll and baitboat fishermen in the North Pacific Under the conditions of certification WFOA is required to communicate the need for regional fisheries management organizations to develop biological reference points to monitor the state of the harvest relative to stock status WFOA supports the development of reference points to insure the long term sustainability of the resource on which our fishermen depend for their livelihood and recognizes the progress made by the ISC Albacore Working Group that has been actively engaged in developing a framework of recommendations At a meeting of the working group in Shimizu Japan in April of 2009 the subject of biological reference points was discussed extensively and recommendations and requests for guidance were sent to the ISC and the Northern Committee The Northern Committee NC of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC at its sixth regular session in September 2010 confirmed that the interim management objective for North Pacific albacore is to maintain the spawning stock biomass SSB above the average level of its 10 historically lowest points ATHL The fishing mortality rate that would likely cause SSB to fall below this level with a probability greater than 50 is referred to as the interim reference point IRP At a recent October 2010 meeting the group discussed the ISC Chairs request for species specific reference points and noted that an interim objective to maintain the spawning stock biomass SSB above the average level of its ten historically lowest points ATHL with a probability greater than 50 has been established for north Pacific albacore and that the associated Fbased reference point FSSBATHLwill be estimated in future stock assessments The FSSB reference point concept was proposed to the WG in 2005 to ensure that SSB in future years remains within the range of the historically observed SSB that supported productive largescale fisheries in the North Pacific for many years
WCPFC7-2010-OP05,2,The Albacore Working Group has developed a framework model for evaluating various approaches that may be a useful tools for eliciting feedback from the Northern Committee that the Working Group needs in order to make further progress on reference points namely the SSB threshold the level of certainty required 50 vs 95 and the projection period that should be used It is likely that approached proposed by the Working Group will be approved and if the requested feedback is provided then it is likely that BRPs will be available for determining appropriate harvest levels when the next stock assessment is produced The Working Group discussed other reference points particularly for presenting F relative to MSYbased reference points but there was no consensus on how or what to Page 2 of 3 choose WFOA believes the Albacore Working Group is moving forward toward a consensus BRP It is commonly agreed that the minimum biomass is not as good a reference point as an MSY based reference point WFOA encourages the further development of an MSY based reference point and urges the WCPFC to request member nations to invest in collecting the biological data that the working group requires to develop robust biological reference points needed to maintain the sustainability of the Pacific albacore resource Thank you for the opportunity to comment on these two very important issues Sincerely Wayne Heikkila Executive Director CC Guillermo A Compean Director IATTC Brian Hallman Deputy Director IATTC Don McIssacc Executive Director PFMC Kitty Simonds Executive Director WPFMC Rod McInnis NMFSNOAA Southwest Regional Office Mark Helvey NMFSNOAA Southwest Regional Office Charles Karnella NMFSNOAA Pacific Islands Regional Office Marija Voikovich California Dept Fish Game Stephen Williams Oregon Dept Of Fish and Wildlfe Michelle Culver Washington Department of Fish and Wildlfe Page 3 of 3
WCPFC7-2010-OP06,1,Opening Statement to the Seventh Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC 10 December Honolulu Hawaii Mr Chairman The Executive Director Honorable delegates fellow observers ladies and gentleman Greenpeace would like to extend our gratitude to the state and people of Hawaii for their welcoming hospitality and the government of the United States for hosting this meeting We would like to welcome Professor Glenn Hurry in his capacity as Executive Director and we look forward to his visionary leadership and expert steering and working with him in the near future This 7th Commission meeting is a critical meeting since tuna is increasingly seen around the world as under threat giving this meeting the opportunity to set things right by preventing the fishery from becoming the next casualty of rampant global overfishing The future of the Pacific and its people will be in your hands as you make decisions this week Greenpeace would like to commend the leadership and continued efforts by all the Pacific Island countries that are members of the Commission to secure and safeguard the future of this fishery In particular The Parties to the Nauru Agreement PNA for taking the bold and positive step by agreeing to the implementation of the 3rd Implementing Arrangement and we urge this Commission to adopt compatible measures as mandated by the Convention This year the WCPFC Scientific Committee SC reported that measures agreed in 2008 do not go far enough to halt overfishing in the region and the crisis facing particularly bigeye stocks continues to deepen Signs of decline in even the once robust skipjack stock are now starting to appear as a result of massive fishing capacity and deadly efficiency These declines are placing great threats on the regions food security and economic prosperity and the current mismanagement is undermining the marine ecosystem and the fishing industry itself This is a huge wakeup call for the region Time and tuna are running out The Commission continues to fail in its mandate to conserve the regions precious tuna resources and unless firm decisions are taken in Hawaii it is on a path to repeat the same mistakes of other failed Tuna Commissions and faces the risk of becoming redundant as the competent body for sustainably managing the regions highly migratory fish stocks Following the debacle of bluefin tuna under ICCATs mismanagement attention is turning to other species of tuna heading to same fate especially bigeye and yellowfin tuna of the WCPO The worlds markets are beginning to reject unsustainable tuna including skipjack originating from purse seine FAD associated fisheries Greenpeace will continue to expose to the public the unsustainable and wasteful practices of tuna fishing globally and corporate players responsible for the continued use of these methods The WCPFC member countries would be wise to embrace
WCPFC7-2010-OP06,2,the demand for sustainable products and enforce policies that meet the standards of the market place The WCPFC needs to build on the measures agreed in 2008 that closed off two high seas pockets to purse seine fishing as well as banning the use of fish aggregating devices FADs in purse seine fisheries These measures are shown to be effective but currently are not adequate enough both temporally and spatially to respond to level of the crisis in the region
WCPFC7-2010-OP06,3,Greenpeace proposes that WCPFC7 agreed to Adopt and Implement the closures of all pockets of high seas to all types of fishing This will complement the benefits derived from the existing high seas pockets closures and will prevent any transfer of high seas fishing effort in particular IUU fishing effort from the closed pockets into other high seas areas
WCPFC7-2010-OP06,4,Adopt and implement a complete yearround ban on the use of FADs in association with purse seine fishing
WCPFC7-2010-OP06,5,Implement an immediate and necessary 50 reduction in tuna fishing effort across the entire WCPO fisheries based on the average 20012004 levels

WCPFC8-2011-OP01,6,High Seas Driftnets still prevail over Sustainable Tuna Fisheries TO NMFS NOAA WCPFC United Nations 111710 From FV OCEAN JOY US Doc 554321 Captain John Harder co founder of Ocean Friends Against Driftnets OFAD Summary of 2010 North Pacific Albacore troll season Before setting out for fishing this season I John Harder tried to pass on to NMFS and the Coastal Commission that High Seas Driftnets are still fishing for albacore tuna in the North Pacific I have been reporting illegal driftnet activity for the past 10 years with pictures of gill net marked fish boat sightings on our international fishing grounds Trip 1 We left San Diego on the 26th of June for fishing On the 30th of June we landed our 1st of many gill net marked fish The fish were averaging 15 lbs These were well marked fish that would indicate targeted in 2009 picture marked A After moving north to the area of 45N X W approximately 70 miles off the coast of Oregon school fish averaging 1012 lbs started showing up with both heavy to light gill net markings on them pictures BG These gill net markings were fresh and indicate driftnet activity done earlier this year The fish were not old enough to be marked in years past They are only average 2 years old Many fish were scuffed up with broken fins tails We landed gill net marked fish every day We ended our trip on the 26th of July I tried notifying NMFS to arrange for an observer but to no avail I submitted my log information hoping that it would be addressed at the technical compliance comity for the WCPFC It was not brought forward Trip 2 We left Westport WA On the 30th of July for off shore Approximately 800 miles west of the coast in the area of 4730N X 14330W we started catching fish again These fish were sometimes heavily marked by High Seas driftnets We averaged 20 marked fish for the trip Many of the 12 lb fish had light scratches were barely visible to the untrained eye The schools of fish were not staying in the same location but migrating into the east towards the west coast We ended our trip into Westport WA on the 26th of August I submitted many pictures along with my log information hoping that it would be addressed at the technical compliance committee for the WCPFCIt was ignored Trip 3 We set out for offshore once again on the30th of August only to get stopped in the approximate area of 4730N X 139W for fishing The 1213 lb avg fish we were landing were relatively clean We had very few gill net marked fish and a more uniform size in the grade This was obviously a different run of fish moving east towards the coast We heard reports of a bigger run of fish being landed in the area of 4430N X 128W inside US EEZ with a major amount of fish having gill net markings on them The avg size of this fish was 12 lbs As I had suspected the fish from offshore on the previous trip had migrated into the coastal waters and was now spreading up down the west coast I talked with Canadian aircraft boarder patrol on the 9th of September Canadian Patrol was not aware of any driftnet vessels sighted previously this year Most of the driftnet marked fish landed this trip were in the 1517 lbs size We ended our trip on the 26th of September in Westport WA I sent pictures of gillnet marked fish along with my log information to NMFS hoping that it would be addressed at the technical compliance committee for the WCPFC Nothing was mentioned Trip 4 We left Westport on the 29th of September for fishing on the coast On October 3rd we landed driftnet marked fish in the area of 4230N X 12620W These fish avg 1517 lb We were only 70 miles off the coast of Northern California I am submitting 9 pictures with this letter log information to NMFS pictures 18 I understand that the technical compliance meeting has already taken place which does not seem appropriate unless people are trying hard to avoid this situation in which case is convenient I will be making this letter public bring it with me to the WCPFC in HA In Dec Conclusion Time time again we have proven with our US tagging programs for albacore tuna that stocks of albacore generally migrate east west across the North Pacific I personally have followed schools of fish starting in the area of 163E 153W along the 44N latitude in a matter of 12 days This is old news to High Seas troll fishermen such as me There have been reports of good fishing in early May June of this year by Japanese vessels If so they must have witnessed some High Seas driftnet activity in their area or they are driftnet vessels themselves How ells do these migrating fish get driftnet marks I ask gillnetters what is the reward for your gillnet tagged fish Where did you tag your gillnet fish Is this incomplete data going to continue Please stand be recognized We all must fish fairly Maybe I should be asking our US state department or Chicken of the Sea My fishery in International waters has been eliminated my coastal fishery is being depleted AGAIN The North South Pacific Albacore stocks should belong to sustainable hook line fisheries NOT driftnets Thanks for your time attention in this matter Regards John Harder Captainowner of FV Ocean Joy In Further consideration OFAD requests the commission to view WCPFCTCC72011OB04 to better understand that more stringent measures must be made and adopted to protect its natural recourses and sustainable fisheries As facts presented show the UN moratorium on high seas driftnets has not deterred the IUU driftnet fishery This other fishery continues to keep its market share driving the price of Albacore Tuna down and depleting the natural recourses along with WCPFCs sustainable tuna fishery In conclusion Revisiting the issue of The Law of the Sea Article 119 Conservation of the living resources of the high seas Part 3 States concerned shall ensure that conservation measures and their implementation do not discriminate in form or in fact against the fishermen of any State Further noting that the Wellington Convention seeks to prohibit driftnet fishing activities in its convention area OFAD feels that the WCPFCs CA should coincide with this ruling As it stands fishermen coming from states in the South Pacific such as New Zealand have more protection against high seas driftnets than fishermen coming from states in the North Pacific such as Canada This is clearly a form of discrimination and therefore should be amended and noted as such In closing OFAD thanks the Commission members of the WCPFC8 in considering these amendments and hopes that the proper attention will be given to these matters It hopes that WCPFC will project a positive report to the United Nations on the status of its sustainable fisheries in the future Regards to all OFAD president John Harder

WCPFC8-2011-OP03,2,Paper prepared by ISSF
WCPFC8-2011-OP03,3,ISSF POSITION STATEMENT Presented during the 8th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Guam 2630 March 2012 The International Seafood Sustainability Foundation ISSF is a global partnership among the tuna industry science and WWF the global conservation organization Our mission is to work toward the sciencebased conservation and management of tuna stocks and the protection of ocean health by supporting regional fisheries management organizations and advocating for the recommendations of each organizations scientific advisory body ISSF would like to thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission for the opportunity to present this position statement supporting decisive action based on the research compiled by the WCPFC Scientific Committee BACKGROUND Bigeye According to an updated assessment completed in 2011 and reported to the 7th Regular Session of the WCPFC Scientific Committee SC7 the fishing mortality for bigeye tuna is well in excess of the maximum sustainable yield MSY level average F 20062009 is about 41 higher than FMSY Analyses presented by SPC at SC7 indicate that CMM 200801 has been unable to limit the total amount of purse seine fishing effort as intended While the catch of bigeye has been reduced during the months of the FAD closure in CMM200801 it is evident that such a seasonal reduction is insufficient to stop overfishing of the stock in the near future given the overall annual level of fishing effort other fisheries need to be limited as well Projections made with alternative management scenarios presented by SPC at TCC7 indicate that closures of the entire purse seine fishery would have somewhat greater conservation benefits for bigeye although the catches of skipjack and yellowfin would be reduced Yellowfin and skipjack The populations of yellowfin and skipjack in the WCPO are not estimated to be in an overfished state nor are they being overfished However it should be noted that in the equatorial region where about 90 of the yellowfin catch is taken the stock may be fully exploited For this reason it is desirable to limit fishing mortality on yellowfin in the western equatorial region Furthermore the skipjack continues to experience high exploitation rates and several CCMs have expressed worry about possible range contractions if fishing mortality were to increase SC7 recommended that the Commission consider developing limits on fishing for skipjack to limit the declines in catch rate associated with further declines in biomass ACTION NEEDED WCPO Closures As stated above it is clear that a seasonal FAD closure is insufficient to reduce the fishing mortality of bigeye to FMSY or below in the short term The WCPFCs monitoring and observer programs including debriefing are not sufficiently developed to ensure that the FAD closure is fully respected Furthermore the many exemptions present in CMM200801 allow for a substantial amount of FAD fishing and fishing by gears other than purse seining contributes to overfishing Recognizing this ISSF urges the WCPFC to implement a complete closure of the purse seine fishery in lieu of a FAD closure1 As indicated above such a closure would have somewhat greater conservation benefits httpissfoundationorg20110115resolution1102wcpfcpurseseinetunacatches accrued to bigeye tuna and particularly if coordinated with similar closures in the IATTC convention area increased ease of monitoring and control of the measure At the same time the longline fishery for bigeye needs to continue to be capped Further ISSF urges individual participating States to collaborate with each other in order to plan for a voluntary complete purse seine closure that will reduce fishing mortality on bigeye tuna should the WCPFC fail to adopt such a meaningful bigeye conservation measure ISSF will revisit this issue at its next Board of Directors meeting following the 8th Regular Session of the WCPFC with a view to formulating and adopting its own scientific conservation measures necessary to ensure the conservation of the bigeye tuna resource in the WCPO Transshipments at Sea ISSF is concerned that if not properly monitored atsea transshipments can create a fertile environment for IUU fishing activities to go undetected For this reason ISSF has issued a conservation measure that calls upon processors traders importers transporters and others involved in the seafood industry to refrain from transactions with purse seine vessels that transship atsea including archipelagic waters and EEZs WCPFCs regulation of transshipment in the Convention Area allows for differences in the regulation of transshipments between archipelagic waters on the one hand and EEZs and the high seas on the other In the event that archipelagic waters of a WCPFC member are not covered by a comparable transshipment regulation ISSF urges States to take compatible measures to regulate monitor and report transshipments in those waters Vessel Registry and Capacity Limitation The first step towards managing capacity is to establish limited entry via a closed vessel registry after which reductions in the number of vessels can be negotiated In a fully exploited fishery coastal states rights to expand their participation in a tuna fishery must be accommodated by mechanisms for reducing the participation of others ISSF calls upon the WCPFC and member nations to develop a record of tuna fishing vessels with unique identifiers2 eg IMO numbers and to adopt a limited entry closed vessel registry with an eye towards ultimately reducing the number of fishing vessels to a level that is commensurate with the productivity of the WCPO fisheries To that end ISSF supports both Japans WCPFC7 proposal to limit further increases in purse seine capacity and the Kobe III call for a freeze in fishing capacity by developed fishing nations and creating mechanisms to transfer capacity to those developing countries with aspirations Continued Progress on Sharks ISSF recognizes the important joint efforts of the WCPFC Scientific Committee Secretariat and SPC to improve fishery statistics on sharks that would allow for their management by the Commission on a speciesbyspecies basis ISSF encourages CCMs to make this issue a priority ISSF strongly supports the SC7 recommendation to adopt mitigation measures for oceanic whitetip sharks in the Convention Area and blue sharks in the north Pacific In addition ISSF urges the Commission to mandate that fins remain naturally attached for any sharks retained onboard ISSF is also asking all RFMOs including the WCPFC to adopt a prohibition on deliberate purse seine setting around whale sharks Reference Points Though seven years have passed since the Convention entered into force the Commission has yet to adopt any reference points in accordance with Article 6 Despite some progress at the scientific level towards the study of potential reference points ISSF is disappointed with the lack of forward movement at the policy level highlighted by the TCC7s inability to recommend any action ISSF urges CCMs to give this matter a high priority in 2012 This includes participation in the global Consolidated List of Authorized Vessels CLAV

WCPFC8-2011-OP04,7,Dear Sir or Madam
WCPFC8-2011-OP04,8,I am writing on behalf of the Pew Environment Group in regards to the discussions that will take place at the upcoming 8th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Commission WCPFC in Guam As you know the WCPFC Convention Area covers nearly 20 of our planet and is home to the worlds largest tuna fishery WCPFCs actions this year can ensure that these critically important fisheries are managed responsibly into the future
WCPFC8-2011-OP04,9,WCPFC 8 offers an opportunity for WCPFC members to adopt effective conservation and management measures that end and prevent overfishing for tunas protect vulnerable shark species and strengthen controls against IUU fishing Our attached policy statement contains the details of what we believe WCPFC delegates should aim to accomplish at this meeting
WCPFC8-2011-OP04,10,This year we also made a short video featuring Pews policy experts and footage from the region Click on the image below to watch Pews WCPFC 8 video
WCPFC8-2011-OP04,11,In particular the Pew Environment Group calls on members of WCPFC to take the following actions at the 8th Regular Session of the Commission
WCPFC8-2011-OP04,12,End Overfishing and Implement the Precautionary Principle With New Conservation Measures for Tropical Tunas o Adopt a new Conservation and Management Measure CMM for tropical tunas that effectively ends over fishing of bigeye tuna o Adopt a CMM on Fish Aggregating Devices FADs to manage their use and provide scientists with data o Establish target and limit reference points for tropical tunas o Strengthen the WCPFC compliance regime for CMMs
WCPFC8-2011-OP04,13,Adopt Conservation Measures to Protect Sharks o Prohibit the retention of oceanic whitetip sharks and establish concrete precautionary catch limits for North Pacific blue sharks o Mandate gear modifications such as the compulsory use of single monofilament nylon traces to protect sharks o Prohibit purse seine vessels from intentionally setting nets around whale sharks o Prohibit the removal of shark fins at sea to improve enforcement of the shark finning ban
WCPFC8-2011-OP04,14,Strengthen Controls Against Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU Fishing o Improve port State measures to deter IUU fishing activities o Require unique vessel identifiers for all vessels operating in the WCPFC area
WCPFC8-2011-OP04,15,We would also like to point your attention to the Closing the Gap report which compares tuna RFMO port State measures with those established by the Port State Measures Agreement The need for such an analysis was highlighted during discussion at the Technical and Compliance Committee 7 meeting last year in order to progress implementation of measures to prevent illegal unregulated and unreported fishing in the WCPFC Convention area We hope you find this analysis both informative and useful
WCPFC8-2011-OP04,16,We look forward to working with you and your delegation in Guam to progress sustainable fisheries in the Pacific through conservation of shark and tuna populations and progress towards elimination of IUU fishing

WCPFC8-2011-OP04,30,Species of concern Bigeye the scientific advice has not changed in several years Overfishing is occurring and the stock may be in an overfished state5 the new CMM should comply with both the advice from the seventh scientific Committee sC7 and article 30 of the convention so that overall fishing mortality is decreased by 39 percent from 2004 levels and a disproportionate burden of conservation action is not placed onto developing states Parties and territories and possessions6 Yellowfin Yellowfin should not experience increases in fishing effort especially in the western equatorial region where the spawning biomass is estimated to have declined to about 31 percent of the unexploited level7 Skipjack sC7 noted that future catch rates are likely to decline and catches will decrease as stocks are fished down to MsY levels8 It recommended that the Commission consider developing limits on skipjack fishing to slow declines in catch rates associated with diminishing biomass9 The primary shortfalls of CMM 200801 were the numerous exemptions the limited area of application and the failure to limit the overall effort on FADs when the ban was not in force The next generation CMM must address these shortfalls implement target and limit reference points and provide an enforceable framework for skipjack yellowfin and bigeye tuna conservation into the future I 6 POLICY stateMent based on the scientific advice and the requirements spelled out in the convention the Pew environment Group encourages WCPFC CCMs to address the following topics in the next generation CMM for tropical tunas1 AdoPT A NEW coMPREhENSivE ANd EffEcTivE coNSERvATioN ANd MANAgEMENT MEASuRE cMM foR TRoPicAl TuNAS11 Extend the FAD closure to end the overfishing of bigeye and put a limit on the number of FAD sets during the nonclosure period Previously the primary mechanism to reduce bigeye mortality in the purse seine fishery had been the FaD closure However increased FaD fishing in the nonclosure period offset the projected conservation gains of the closure10 WCPFC should extend the closure and limit the number of FaD sets in the nonclosure period to 2010 levels12 Maintain the management advice from CMM 200801 on longline fisheries and increase observer coverage to 100 percent on largescale freezer longline vessels and 20 percent on all other longline vessels a recent analysis of monitoring control and surveillance risks in the western and central Pacific notes unlike other parts of the world there is a strong case to be made that the majority of Iuu activity in the FFa region Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries agency is associated with licensed vessels11 Misreporting of target catch and bycatch is one of the most widespread compliance issues in the region and continues to undermine CMMs and the integrity of data provided to scientists to fully address these problems 100 percent of the longline fishing activity should be observed Pew recognizes that 100 percent observer coverage would be impossible to implement across the entire fleet in the near term However given the high impact that largescale freezer longliners have on target and associated and dependent species WCPFC should mandate 100 percent observer coverage on these vessels Pew also recommends that WCPFC increase coverage levels on all other longliners to at least 20 percent in accordance with the best available scientific advice12 WCPFC should also investigate the potential for the use of electronic monitoring ie require cameras and daily catch reporting through a vessel monitoring system or VMs until misreporting in the longline fishery is addressed CMMs will continue to fall short of their objectives scientists will have incomplete and inaccurate data for stock assessments and future potential benefits from maintaining sustainable stocks in the region will be undermined 13 Ensure that CCMs that benefit the most from bigeye fishing lead bigeye conservation efforts according to article 30 of the convention WCPFC must implement measures to ensure that a disproportionate burden of conservation action is not placed on developing states Parties and territories and possessions In short the WCPFC CCMs that benefit the most from bigeye fishing should lead conservation efforts see tables 1 and 2 I 7 POLICY stateMent Table 1 CCMs that benefit the most from bigeye tuna in longline fisheries Table 2 the 10 WCPFC CCMs with the highest catch of bigeye tuna in the purse seine fishery the number of purse seine vessels average bigeye tuna catch per

meeting in november 2011 it was informally proposed that a 250 charge per tonne of bigeye tuna caught by CCM longline fleets be charged as a conservation levy this is one possible solution as is the possibility of pricing vessel days at a higher rate when fishing on FaDs in recognition of the impact of that effort on juveniles ie one FaD fishing day may be charged as two fishing days regardless of the mechanism used the aim must be to minimize juvenile bigeye catch and not to undermanage the bigeye population or treat it as a secondary consideration both of which run counter to implementation of an ecosystembased approach14 Maintain and expand high seas pocket closures High seas pocket closures should be maintained at least until measures demonstrated to prevent and deter Iuu activity in those areas are in place and effectively implemented For these closures to be effective in reducing the catch of bigeye tuna overall fishing effort must be reduced instead of displaced and the closures should also apply to longline fisheries as they routinely transship at sea ccMs Economic Benefit from longline Activities in the WcPfc convention Area 200913 republic of Korea

the high seas and EEZs the new CMM should cover the entire WCPFC Convention area to avoid the pitfalls of the previous measure Furthermore measures between eeZs and high seas areas must be consistent to ensure that conservation is not undermined throughout the range of the species the Pacific Island states that are Parties to the nauru agreement Pna have shown leadership in adopting strong precautionary measures that are in force in their eeZs and the WCPFC should take measures that are equally effective in conserving these critical resources across the entire convention area 2 AdoPT A

onehalf of the shark species taken in high seas fisheries are classified as endangered Vulnerable or near threatened on the International union for the Conservation of nature IuCn red List16 until robust stock assessments are available CMMs should be developed to protect sharks as a precautionary measure even though the WCPFC is the most modern of the tuna rFMOs and has the clearest mandate to protect species within its jurisdiction it is the only tuna rFMO that has not taken meaningful action on sharks the WCPFC must act to ensure that targeted fishing and bycatch do not deplete shark

this species Analysis confirmed that oceanic whitetip sizes decreased significantly until samples became too scarce for analysis Given the strong existing evidence for the depleted state of the oceanic whitetip population in the WCPO stock assessment studies may clarify but will not alter the case for further conservation and management action17 additionally WCPFC should continue to add to

pressure and the recovery potential for depleted shark species is significantly less than that of other fish species Many longline vessels use a wire leader also known as a steel trace to secure their catch on the line Whether unintended unwanted or highly sought after shark bycatch from wire leaders and the impact of shark removals on wider ecosystem stability need urgent attention Prohibition of wire leaders would also facilitate compliance with WCPFCs existing CMM 201007 paragraph 10 Gear modifications such as the use of single monofilament nylon leaders should be mandated so that fewer sharks are caught as bycatch in WCPFC tuna fisheries additionally vessels fishing in the WCPFC area should be required to immediately release all live sharks 3 PRohiBiT PuRSE SEiNE vESSElS fRoM iNTENTioNAlly SETTiNg NETS ARouNd WhAlE ShARkS to protect these slowmoving sharks WCPFC should prohibit purse seine vessels from intentionally setting nets around whale sharks in the convention area and in their eeZs because mortality occurs in approximately one in every 10 sets involving a whale shark interaction20 Further because whale sharks rarely escape unassisted before the net is closed vessel operators must be required to safely release entangled whale sharks It is estimated that about 60 whale sharks were killed by fishing nets in 2009 in WCPFC fisheries which is far too many for a species classified by the IUCN as Vulnerable to extinction Scientific studies have shown a nylon monofilament leader is actually a better gear option than a wire leader for reducing bycatch of sharks and increasing the catch of some targeted species19 I 124 PRohiBiT ThE REMovAl of ShARk fiNS AT SEA To iMPRovE ENfoRcEMENT of ThE ShARk fiNNiNg BAN WCPFCs existing ban on finning can be strengthened

has urged states to cooperate regionally through rFMOs to adopt all necessary port measures consistent with International law24 the Pew environment Group has conducted a gap analysis comparing the PsMs in WCPFC and the other tuna rFMOs with those established by the PsMa the research assessed the extent to which measures adopted by these rFMOs meet the new international minimum standard set by the PsMa this work revealed a number of gaps in the WCPFCs PsMs25 In particular WCPFC lacks a comprehensive inspection scheme it does not have rules in place requiring vessels to provide information prior to entering ports and it does not require port states to designate ports of entry for foreign vessels the Pew environment Group is aware that a number of WCPFC CCMs cannot fully implement the provisions of the PsMa immediately this should not however be an impediment to WCPFC taking the initiative to strengthen its PsMs WCPFC can initiate constructive action towards the development of stronger measures by gradually adopting enhanced PsMs in line with the PsMa In doing so WCPFC CCMs should analyze their needs and identify the steps they should be taking to implement PsMs effectively26 Developed state members should identify options for assisting developing states to effectively implement PsMs this should include but not be limited to participation in the process initiated by the un Food and agriculture Organization FaO to implement article 21 of the PsMa on the special needs and requirements of developing states27 WCPFC CCMs should take steps at the March 2012 meeting to begin strengthening PsMs with the aim of meeting the standards of the PsMa by 2014 this should include providing the necessary support to developing states to effectively implement PsMs POLICY stateMent A study has estimated the loss from IUU fishing in the western and central Pacific Ocean region to be approximately 21 to 46 percent of reported catch which is valued at up to US15 billion per year21 I 14 In particular at this years meeting WCPFC CCMs should consider adopting the following reforms28 Develop a comprehensive system of port inspections establish clear duties

WCPFC8-2011-OP05,3,th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission March 2012 Guam USA Summary The upcoming WCPFC annual meeting will review Conservation and Management Measure 2008 CMM200801 the rescue plan that was agreed in 2008 to safeguard the Pacifics valuable tuna and make decisions on how to strengthen this important conservation and management measure It is clear that CMM200801 which specifically focuses on addressing the overfishing of bigeye tuna and ensuring yellowfin tuna stocks are managed sustainably is not going far enough to protect these precious marine resources The measure was not ambitious enough to halt overfishing and the many exemptions included in the measure have meant that it was practically impossible to achieve all of its objectives Findings presented at the WCPFC Scientific Committee SC meeting last year highlighted that despite the success of a number of elements within the current measure purse seine fishing effort has continued to increase Bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks are in decline in the region and have recently been assessed as Vulnerable and Near Threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN1 While skipjack tuna stocks are not described as being overfished according to current management target reference points there are concerns that high and increasing catches are having a significant negative impact on stock size The WCPFC now has an opportunity to be a global leader in tuna management by agreeing to take swift action to significantly strengthen this measure by following scientific advice to further cut fishing by including additional high seas closures and banning the use of FADs in purse seine fisheries By agreeing such measures the WCPFC will not only avoid the impending fisheries management disaster but also meet the growing expectations of the market place in providing sustainable tuna Greenpeace therefore urges that the following key elements be included in the outcomes of the WCPFCs 8th regular session The permanent closure of the four high seas pockets to all fishing a total ban on the use of FADs with purse seine fishing and immediately implement a precautionary 50 cut in the fishing mortality for bigeye tuna including in longline fisheries Collette BB Carpenter KE Polidoro BA et al 2011 High value and long life Double jeopardy for tuna and billfishes Science 333 2912 Supporting online material athttpwwwsciencemagorgcontentsuppl20110706science1208730DC11208730ColletteSOMRevision1pdf

WCPFC8-2011-OP05,12,Tuna Key Resource for Pacific Islands Economies
WCPFC8-2011-OP05,13,Tuna provides coastal states such as the Pacific Island countries Philippines and Indonesia with much needed nourishment and a key source of economic activity However this vital resource is being fished into certain oblivion primarily by countries outside the Pacific despite approximately of the rich tuna grounds being found in the EEZs of Pacific Island countries Countries such as Korea Taiwan Japan the US and the EU spurred on by corporate lobbyists are sending increasing numbers of fishing vessels in their many thousands to plunder these waters To make matters worse tuna fishing vessels from outside the Pacific are in some cases literally stealing tuna stealing one of the only exploitable resources from countries that are among the smallest poorest least developed and most vulnerable in the world Tuna Meltdown Despite the adoption of CMM200801 tuna catches in the Pacific have continued to increase signaling its failure to meet fishing effort reduction objectives The provisional catch of tuna for 2010 was the 2nd highest annual reported catch 2414994 metric tonnes for the Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPO just 80000 metric tonnes less than 2009s recordbreaking catch This also represents almost 60 of the global tuna catch2 These peaks are accompanied by the upward and recordsetting trend of the purse seine fishery with 2010 levels of purse seine fishing effort being significantly higher than in previous years Bigeye According to the WCPFC Scientific Committee the bigeye tuna stock has been reduced to less than half of its levels prior to 1970 through overfishing and the increased harvest of juveniles See page 1 SC 2011 Executive Summary Science Committee Seventh Regular Session 917 August 2011 Pohnpei Federated States of Micronesia WCPFChttpwwwwcpfcintdocexecutivesummaryprovisionalsc7summaryreport
WCPFC8-2011-OP05,14,mainly from the use of FADs3Not only is overfishing occurring but based on the average recruitment in recent years scientists are concluding that the bigeye tuna stock is also likely to be overfished and the spawning biomass is as low as 23 of its potential spawning level4 The SC meeting recognised that it is currently too early to quantitatively conclude whether CMM01 has reduced fishing mortality for bigeye tuna to the levels specified in the CMM Incomplete and insufficient data for 2009 and 2010 has also meant that fisheries models for 2010 are still uncertain and inconclusive5 However part of the problem is due to the range of exemptions that undermine its success Removal of these exemptions would remove about 50 of the estimated overfishing6 When reviewing CMM200801 and agreeing an enhanced new measure CMM2012 the TCC agreed to use the existing measure and its elements as the starting point SC7 did recommend additional measures to ensure further reductions in fishing mortality above those expected at the CMM2008017Greenpeace believes that many of the elements contained in the original CMM still apply and key elements should be retained updated and strengthened The current measure should remain in place unless the Commission agrees otherwise or there is an explicit cessation date Greenpeace recommends a 50 reduction in the catch rates of bigeye tuna from the recent average levels 20062009 to ensure that bigeye tuna stocks are given the best chance to recover to more precautionary levels It is vital that the newly agreed measures are considerably more effective and ambitious than the current 30 reduction that is contained in the CMM200801 in order to take into account poor catch reporting lack of independent observer data from longliners and uncertainties of the stock assessments Yellowfin The SC meeting concluded that WCPO yellowfin is not likely to be experiencing overfishing or in an overfished state according to current management objectives although there are significant uncertainties involved in the assessments Strong indications were provided however showing that this stock is in trouble8 Exploitation rates were the highest in the western equatorial region which accounts for more than three quarters of the total yellowfin catch and spawning biomass is estimated to have declined to less than a third of its unexploited levels Based on the Fmsy reference point currently used one model showed that there is a possibility that overfishing is occurring In addition New Zealand has reported a decline in catches which may indicate range contraction as the stock declines in size The high mortality rate of juvenile yellowfin primarily due to purse seine FAD fisheries is of particular concern with the SC concluding the See paragraphs 10 and 18 SC 2011 Executive Summary Science Committee Seventh Regular Session 917 August 2011 Pohnpei Federated States of Micronesia WCPFC httpwwwwcpfcintdocexecutivesummaryprovisionalsc7summaryreport See also paragraphs 141 of SC 2011 Summary Reporthttpwwwwcpfcintnode3961 See page 29 paragraph 141 SC 2011 Summary Report Science Committee Seventh Regular Session 917 August 2011 Pohnpei Federated States of Micronesia WCPFC httpwwwwcpfcintnode3961 See page 3 paragraphs 1121 SC 2011 Executive Summary Science Committee Seventh Regular Session 917 August 2011 Phonpei Federated States of Micronesia WCPFC httpwwwwcpfcintdocexecutivesummaryprovisionalsc7summaryreport See page 4 last paragraph OFPSPC 2011 WCPFCTCC7201131httpwwwwcpfcintdocwcpfctcc7201131projectionsbasedstockassessments SC 7 recommended that there should be a minimum of a 32 reduction in fishing mortality from the average levels for 20062009 to return the fishing mortality rate to FMSY This is the equivalent to a minimum of a 39 reduction of the 2004 level in fishing mortality and a 28 reduction of the average 20012004See page 38 SC 2011 Summary Report Science Committee Seventh Regular Session 9 August 2011 Pohnpei Federated States of Micronesia WCPFChttpwwwwcpfcintnode3961 Paragraph 2531 SC 2011 Executive Summary Science Committee Seventh Regular Session 917 August 2011 Pohnpei Federated States of Micronesia WCPFChttpwwwwcpfcintdocexecutivesummaryprovisionalsc7summary reporthttpwwwwcpfcintdocexecutivesummaryprovisionalsc7summaryreport
WCPFC8-2011-OP05,15,productivity of the stock would be significantly increased if juvenile catches were decreased9These indicators along with the uncertainty in stock assessments call for further reductions in yellowfin mortality to be included in the new CMM particularly with regard to juvenile yellowfin The importance of yellowfin fisheries to many coastal states underlines the urgent need for a precautionary approach in managing this stock Skipjack Skipjack catches in 2010 were the 2nd highest recorded While the stock is not described as being overfished there are concerns that if recent fishing patterns continue catch levels are likely to decline as stock levels are fished down to MSY levels Additionally high catches in the equatorial region could result in range contractions of the stock thus reducing skipjack availability to higher latitudes Japan Australia New Zealand and Hawaii have already reported catch declines10The precautionary approach must be applied in setting management targets to ensure these relatively abundant fish stocks and the economic viability of this fishery are not jeopardised It is therefore important that the new measure is applicable to skipjack tuna South Pacific Albacore Finally the albacore fishery also requires more protection and must also be covered by the CMM While this stock is considered relatively healthy without limits placed on this fishery there is a danger that fishing effort will be transferred from the more regulated stocks to albacore The fishery is particularly important to South Pacific nations and increases in catches will result in catch rate declines and associated impacts on vessel profitability11 Need for Greater Precaution Set Reference and Limit Points A precautionary and ecosystembased approach to fisheries management urgently requires the rejection of unsustainable fishing practices such as FADs in purse seine fisheries and the use of areabased management tools such as well enforced marine reserves Greenpeace strongly urges that a process is set swiftly into place to ensure that ecosystembased precautionary limit reference points and precautionary target reference points for all stocks as required by the UN Fish Stocks Agreement must be set by the WCPFC as well as management measures to ensure these targets are not exceeded and necessary actions can be taken swiftly if these targets are surpassed These reference points must take into account nontargetbycatch species and the ecosystem with priority made for species that are listed as threatened or endangered and also including economic and social objectives Cut Overcapacity Overcapacity is at the core of the everdeepening unsustainable exploitation of the regions tuna stocks This needs to be reversed so the Pacific will not be robbed of its opportunity to reap large economic benefits from the tuna resource and lose its edge in marketing these products under better environmental credentials The underlying issue to all these management challenges continues to be the fact that there is simply too much fishing capacity operating in the region chasing rapidly declining stocks and strongly contributing to overfishing A capacity reduction scheme which results in a significant Paragraph 27 and 31 Executive Summary Science Committee Seventh Regular Session 917 August 2011 Pohnpei Federated States of Micronesia WCPFChttpwwwwcpfcintdocexecutivesummaryprovisionalsc7summary reporthttpwwwwcpfcintdocexecutivesummaryprovisionalsc7summaryreport Paragraph 34 and 35 SC 2011 Executive Summary Science Committee Seventh Regular Session 917 August 2011 Pohnpei Federated States of Micronesia WCPFC httpwwwwcpfcintdocexecutivesummaryprovisionalsc7summaryreport Paragraphs 4142 SC 2011 Executive Summary Science Committee Seventh Regular Session 917 August 2011 Pohnpei Federated States of Micronesia WCPFC httpwwwwcpfcintdocexecutivesummaryprovisionalsc7summaryreport

WCPFC8-2011-OP05,21,Ecological Benefits of Closures A significant increase in bigeye spawning mass appears when high seas areas pocket 3 4 and high seas area proposed under PNA agreement14 are closed to longlining in combination with closing off purse seine fishing and eliminating the effort from both pockets 3 4 and high seas areas as well as pockets 1 and 2 Therefore closing pockets 3 4 and the PNA proposed high seas area to longline fishing has a much greater beneficial effect than just purse seine closures and the effects are widespread throughout the region For example part of a known bigeye spawning area that begins in the Eastern Pacific Ocean lies within pockets 3 4 and the PNA proposed high seas area Longliners target sexually mature adult fish which is near the size of 50 mature female bigeye The combination of high levels of juvenile bycatch in purse seining with catch of adult female bigeye by longliners is having a detrimental impact of the bigeye stock throughout its life history15 The closure of pockets 3 4 as well as the other high seas area would also be effective for managing these fisheries as the climate warms In particular it would ameliorate the dramatic effect that the El NioSouthern Oscillation ENSO is having on the distribution of tropical tunas Warmer water that is preferred by skipjack tuna is being extended to the east during El Nio episodes This is resulting in high purse seine catches of skipjack and presumably high incidental catches of bigeye in the central region Closing all 4 pocketsand additional high seas area would ameliorate the effects of ENSO on the efficacy of the area closures as conservation measures and mitigate longterm variability by reducing catch of juveniles and protecting part of the spawning grounds whatever the ENSO phase If future changes projected under IPCC scenarios are correct that more frequent El Nio events will occur there will be a spatial shift of the core habitat of skipjack and bigeye tunas toward the central region16 The further potential benefits of the high seas closure to the fisheries management of the West and Central Pacific include protection of spawning areas potential increased yields through the export of larvae and spillover of fish help compliance and the control of IUU fishing provide insurance against fisheries collapse and the failure of other management measures ie providing a form of bet hedging for coping with uncertainty and lack of knowledge in order to reduce overall risk Much of the documentation of positive impacts of marine reserves on commercial fish species comes from studies relating to small area closures in coastal waters often in reef areas as most closures to date have been of this type These studies highlight that it takes a number of years for the reserves to yield positive effects especially in terms of increased yields in adjacent waters17A global metaanalysis demonstrates that globally old reserves are more effective than young All high seas areas between 10N and 20S and 170E and 150W Page 6 paragraph 4 Sibert J Senina I Lehodey P 2011Prospects for effective conservation of bigeye tuna stocks in the W estern Central Pacific OceanSC7MIWP05httpwwwwcpfcintdocsc7miwp05prospectseffectiveconservationbigeyetunastocks westerncentralpacificocean Page 56 Sibert J Senina I Lehodey P 2011 Prospects for effective conservation of bigeye tuna stocks in the Western Central Pacific OceanSC7MIWP05httpwwwwcpfcintdocsc7miwp05prospectseffectiveconservationbigeyetunastockswestern centralpacificocean The establishment of marine reserves in the Soufriere Marine Management Area of St Lucia and in Egypts Red Sea both led to increased yields in adjacent areas after 5 years See Allsopp M Page R Johnston P and Santillo D 2009 State of the OceansPub Springer ISBN 97814020 91155 One of the best documented cases of the positive effects of closing large areas to fisheries is the closure of the Georges Bank in the Gulf of Maine USA where three areas totaling 17000 km were closed to all forms of fishing that might impact groundfish Five years after the closures were implemented together with a package of measures that cut fishing effort the closures were hailed as a success with positive effects on stocks of haddock yellowtail witch flounders and cod See Gell FG and Roberts CL 2003 Benefits beyond boundaries the fishery effects of marine reserves Trends in Ecology and Evolution volume 18 issue 9 pp448455
WCPFC8-2011-OP05,22,reserves at increasing fish densities The results imply that reserves should be maintained for up to years following establishment even if they initially appear ineffective18 As the actual establishment of marine reserves and marine protected areas especially in the high seas and for highly migratory fish species is a relatively new endeavour there are few data but some models suggest positive benefits A recent modelling exercise demonstrates that fisheries benefits can be may be derived from reserves not just for overexploited stocks of lowmobility species but also to a lesser extent for underexploited stocks and highmobility species19i The researchers also note that greatly increased resilience to overfishing is also found in the majority of cases The authors conclude that a reserve provides benefits additional to those obtained from simple effort control However benefits from reserves depend to a major extent on the amount of effort redistribution following reserve establishment and on fishing selectivity hence these factors should be key components of any evaluation of reserve effectiveness Say No to FADs in Purse Seine Fisheries The use of fish aggregating devices FADs in purse seine tuna fisheries has major consequences for the sustainability of tuna fisheries as they increase the efficiency of purse seiners in a way that is difficult to control and measure they increase the catch of juvenile skipjack bigeye and yellowfin tunas and they result in bycatch of nontarget and vulnerable species such as sharks turtles and other fish species Of utmost concern is the shocking practice by some purse seine vessels that intentionally set their destructive nets on whales dolphins and whale sharks animals protected under numerous international agreements in order to get to the prized tuna Often these animals are killed in the process For example in 2009 it was estimated that there were 1323 toothed cetacean deaths and whale shark deaths due to encirclement by purse seine nets20Greenpeace strongly supports the proposal by Australia for an urgent new CMM that specifically bans purseseining on whale sharks and cetaceans and sets best practice guidelines for the release and reporting of these animals if accidentally caught In 2008 the WCPFC adopted measures within its CMM that restricted the use of FADs Evidence provided to the SC noted that while it was still early days to fully assess the impact of the FAD closure trends are encouraging As was illustrated again in 2010 the threemonth ban on the use of FADs was found to be effective in significantly reducing the catch of bigeye tuna compared to the other months of the year Overall total catch was below average during the FAD ban period in 2009 and 2010 Purse seine catch of bigeye tuna was significantly reduced21 during these closure periods compared to other months of those years However total purse seine effort increased between 2008 to 2010 with 2009 being a near record high for associated school effort in spite of the two month FAD closure It is clear from the Molloy PP McLean IB and Cote IM 2009 Effects of marine reserves on fish populations a global metaanalysis Journal of Applied Ecology 2009 46 743751 P Apostolaki P MilnerGulland EJ McAllister MK and KirkwoodGP 2011Modeling the Effects of Establishing a Marine Reserve for Mobile Fish Species Canadian Journal of Fisheries and aquatic Sciences published on the web 12 April 2011 httpwwwnrcresearchpresscomdoiabs101139f02018 Impact of Purse Seine Fishing Activity on Whale Sharks and Cetaceans Paper prepared by Australia WCPFCTCC72011DP01 httpwwwwcpfcintsystemfilesdocumentsmeetingstechnicalandcompliance ommittee7thregularsessiondelegationpapersWCPFCTCC72011DP20Whale20Sharks20and20Cetaceanspdf Paragraph 338 SC 2011 Summary Report Science Committee Seventh Regular Session 917 August 2011 Pohnpei Federated States of Micronesia WCPFC httpwwwwcpfcintnode3961
WCPFC8-2011-OP05,23,preliminary results that FAD bans are effective for the time that they are in effect However if purse seine effort is increasing outside the threemonth FAD closure and exemptions still exist to the CMM any benefits accrued during the ban period are being offset in the rest of the months therefore rendering the short ban ineffective It is also difficult to get a full picture due to lack of relevant data as data was presented for the area 20N and 20S only and did not include the purse seine catches outside this area nor did it include catches from the Indonesian and Philippine fleets where catch of juvenile tuna is known to be particularly high Given the scientific recommendation for bigeye mortality reduction is a 39 reduction on 2004 levels22 it is clear that the WCPFC urgently needs to extend the FAD ban measure as an effective means of reducing the fishing mortality of bigeye and to allow the recovery of the stock to precautionary levels The SC made the conclusion that Limitation of FADs use would have a strong positive impact on bigeye stock conservation Greenpeace believes that the use of all objects that are deployed artificially as FADs or fishing on nonintentional FADs by purse seine fisheries should be banned globally by all the tuna RFMOs A total FAD ban in purse seine fisheries within the WCPO would clearly be the best means of reducing the bigeye purse seine catch as well as bycatch of threatened and endangered marine life such as sharks and to some extent turtles that are known to be attracted to FADs and get caught up in purse seine nets Overall the fishery is better off without FADs as the projections predict that total catch is quite stable and in fact increases slightly for increasing duration of FAD closure This is because of the higher yield per recruit that is achieved for all species resulting from the larger average size of tuna taken in unassociated sets compared to FAD sets 23 In addition recent studies demonstrate an overall economic benefit of reducing FAD use24 Enhanced Enforcement Key Role of NGOs Greenpeace commends efforts by the Commission to establish an enhanced compliance monitoring scheme CMS to ensure compliance with CMMs At WCPF7 a proposal put forward by Australia included the participation of NGOs in such a measure to provide information to the Commission on noncompliance by CCMs The Commission Chair reflecting on experience from various committees and governance bodies suggested that the benefits of allowing interested parties to make information available outweighed the drawbacks citing the effectiveness of this approach in development of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement The Commission asked Australia to continue to work intersessionally to identify a range of possible responses to noncompliance as provided in Para 23 of CMM 201003 and report to TCC7 Allowing NGOs to supply information for compliance purposes given the lack of surveillance capacity in the region would add to the Commissions efforts of ensuring compliance with CMMs Such practice is already formalised in other tuna RFMOs such as ICCAT Observers in particular environmental NGOs are playing an increasingly participatory role in the Commissions monitoring control and surveillance responsibilities particularly with regards to maritime surveillance of both the high seas managed areas and national waters A formal process for the submission and SC 7 recommended that there should be a minimum of a 32 reduction in fishing mortality from the average levels for 20062009 to return the fishing mortality rate to FMSY This is the equivalent to a minimum of a 39 reduction of the 2004 level in fishing mortality and a 28 reduction of the average 20012004See page 38 SC 2011 Summary Report Science Committee Seventh Regular Session 9 August 2011 Pohnpei Federated States of Micronesia WCPFChttpwwwwcpfcintnode3961 Page 34 last paragraph OFPSPC 2011 Projections based on the 2011 stock assessments WCPFCTCC7201131 httpwwwwcpfcintdocwcpfctcc7201131projectionsbased2011stockassessments Bailey MU Sumaila R Martel S 2011Can cooperative management of tuna fisheries in the Pacific solve the growth overfishing problem Fisheries center University of British Columbia working paper 20111

WCPFC8-2011-OP06,6,WWF TRAFFIC call on WCPFC to remove all current exemptions from CMM201004 and encourage all fishing nations to implement the substantial management measures for juvenile age03 PBT to keep fishing mortality of PBT to no more than its 20022004 fishing mortality level III4 South Pacific Albacore WWF and TRAFFIC support the effort of Island Small Developing States Pacific SIDS to strengthen the management strategy for the albacore longline fishery and to address the related species interaction issues Measures aimed at introducing effective capacity limits and effort management must be urgently addressed by WCPFC and the regions domestic fisheries managers
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,7,IV Regional Observer Program ROP WWF TRAFFIC consider the presence of observers on every fishing and support vessel fundamental to fishing best practice and call for a comprehensive and strong Regional Observer Program with 100 coverage of all fishing vessels including both catching and support vessels WWF TRAFFIC call upon the WCPFC to meet the 100 ROP target by 2013
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,8,V Catch Documentation Scheme WWF TRAFFIC recommend the adoption of a comprehensive CDS measure for at least the five key tuna species1 with a date of implementation to be agreed and implemented
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,9,VI Mitigation of Bycatch Impacts WWF and TRAFFIC remind WCPFC members participating territories and cooperating nonmembers of their responsibility to address the bycatch of species and act immediately A number of environmental NGOs including WWF and TRAFFIC have developed a Compendium 2011 of best practice Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the bycatch of four taxonomic groups2 This Compendium and the individual draft binding measures provides WCPFC with advice on the best practice and precautionary measures that must be implemented on an interim basis pending the determination of optimal mitigation packages based on research and sound science These actions can be reviewed and revised to reflect that advice when it becomes available
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,10,WWF and TRAFFIC also request that WCPFC implement the recommendations of the joint technical bycatch working group from Kobe III the joint tuna RFMO process3 Bigeye Tuna Yellowfin Tuna Albacore Tuna Skipjack Tuna Pacific Bluefin Tuna Seabirds Sharks Sea turtles and Marine mammals WCPFC8201115 WWF TRAFFIC Statement to the WCPFC 8 Regular Session Guam 2630 March 2012 3
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,11,Main text
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,12,WWF TRAFFIC remind members participating territories and cooperating nonmembers of our positions tabled at the last meeting of the WCPFC in Honolulu in December 2010 WCPFC7 related subsequent meetings of the WCPFC and the recommendations of the joint tuna RFMO process Kobe Process prioritizing Harvest strategy Harvest control rules
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,13,The precautionary approach Convention article 5c to fisheries management has been considered a basic element of sustainability since its introduction in the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement It has been widely adopted in domestic and international law asan underpinning requirement for good management and included in the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries It also appears prominently in the FAO Guidelines for Ecolabelling and is a critical element for consideration in ecolabelling certification schemes such as the Marine Stewardship Council
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,14,The basic tenet is simple do not take actions that could have an unacceptably high risk of compromising the health of the resource or its environment in the long term The implementation of a precautionary approach is in most cases made operational through preagreed management actions also called harvest control rules that are launched as soon as stock status indicators reach certain critical values ie reference points
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,15,There are no explicit harvest control rules in the WCPFC Monitoring of the stocks is based on catch and effort data lengthfrequency and tagging data The current rudimentary harvest strategy employed in the WCPFC does not contain any harvest control rules and as such does not reflect best practice The primary management action involves limiting fishing effort via an array of input controls such as the PNAs Vessel Day Scheme VDS closure of high seas pockets FAD closures and implementation of capacity limits driven by concerns for BET and YFT The Convention for the WCPFC includes default target and limit reference points and the management objective for all target stocks is to maintain stocks at or above MSYbased reference points The absence of harvest control rules that provide for immediate and effective action to reduce exploitation rates when and as required is a serious concern This is potentially an increasingly scrutinized flaw in the management of these fisheries if an international market perspective is taken While the WCPFC could argue that it is capable of implementing management action in response to scientific advice on stock status for example BET and YFT the effectiveness of this action is questionable and this underlines the importance of well defined harvest control rules to ensure timely and adequate management WWF TRAFFIC Statement to the WCPFC 8 Regular Session Guam 2630 March 2012 4
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,16,WWF TRAFFIC call on the WCPFC to adopt harvest control rules that are welldefined preagreed and contain mandatory actions for an agreed and determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points Reference points The WCPFC has not adopted formal reference points for any tuna or tuna related species under its management in accordance with Article 6 WCPFC 2004 WWF TRAFFIC noted that in 2009 a special workshop on reference points was held by the WCPFC Scientific Committees Methods Specialist Working Group WWF TRAFFIC understands that it was expected that the Scientific Committee would make recommendations on appropriate provisional limit reference points for the key target species to the WCPFC in 2010 The Commissions decisions on reference points will also take into account the outcomes of the Workshop on Management Objectives held in 2010 WWF TRAFFIC note however that reference points have been under consideration in the WCPFC since 2006
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,17,There can be no certainty that this will not be delayed again or the Commission will formally adopt them
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,18,WWF TRAFFIC strongly urges the WCPFC to formally adopt limit and target reference points The adoption of explicitly determined limit and target reference points for at least the four key tuna species namely skipjack albacore yellowfin and bigeye is an absolute priority for the sustainable management of these resources in the WCPO Proposed CMM 201101 for Bigeye Yellowfin and Skipjack tuna in the WCPFC Convention Area WWF TRAFFIC sees a need for the improved performance of WCPFC if it is to ensure that tuna stocks it is responsible for are managed sustainably The most recent assessment of yellowfin tuna YFT by the SPC concludeses the stock is not in an overfished state This is encouraging news however it comes with the responsibility of ensuring that YFT fishing mortality is limited to its 20012004 level The status of bigeye tuna BET on the other hand raises significant concern 1 Bigeye Tuna The conclusion from the SC7 Report based on the 2011 assessment of BET in the WCPO indicates that current levels of catch are unlikely to be sustainable in the long term even at the recent high levels of recruitment estimated for the last two decades SC7 Summary Report Para 141f At the least it is approaching an overfished state but if recent recruitment is assumed to represent the true productivity of the bigeye stock Run21 then the higher levels of BMSY and SBMSY would mean that BET is already in an overfished state SC7 Summary Report Para 141h
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,19,The SC7 in its management advice has recommended for BET o A minimum of 32 reduction in fishing mortality from average levels for 20062009 to return the fishing mortality rate to FMSY This recommended level of reduction is equivalent to a minimum WWF TRAFFIC Statement to the WCPFC 8 Regular Session Guam 2630 March 2012 5 reduction of the 2004 level in fishing mortality and a 28 reduction of the average 20012004 levels o The Commission should consider the results of updated projections at WCPFC8 and adopt additional measures to secure additional reductions in fishing mortality above those expected from the current CMM to ensure that fishing mortality is reduced to at least the FMSY level and remove the risk of the stock being overfished o Measures that reduce fishing mortality across a range of fish sizes eg fishing gears are likely to produce the best results o The use of a spatial management approach o The timely provision of all data necessary for stock assessment purposes o The Commission should consider the results of updated projections at WCPFC8
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,20,WWF TRAFFIC reiterate our recommendation from WCPFC7 for the need to support fully the SC recommendation to the WCPF Commission for returning the WCPO BET stock back to levels above BSMY and therefore implementing measures that successfully reduce levels of fishing mortality by a minimum of 32 from average levels for 20062009 or equivalent to a minimum 39 reduction of the level in fishing mortality and a 28 reduction of the average 20012004 levels 2 Yellowfin Tuna The conclusion from the SC7 Report based on the 2011 assessment of YFT in the WCPO indicates that overfishing is not occurring and that the stock is not in an overfished state
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,21,The SC7 in its management advice has recommended for YFT o Improved data collection that will better inform the robustness of the YFT fishery in the WCPO in particular catch data particularly from the domestic fisheries of Indonesia and the Philippines and the purseseine catch SC7 Paragraph 184 and o That due to differences in fishing mortality and exploitation rates between regions highest in region ie the western equatorial region accounting for approximately 81 of the total YFT catch there should be no increase in fishing mortality in the western equatorial region SC7 Paragraphs 198
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,22,WWF TRAFFIC call for the precautionary approach to be observed and supports the Scientific Committees recommendation to the Commission made previously for YFT in the WCPO to limit YFT fishing mortality to its 20012004 level 3 Pacific Bluefin Tuna
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,23,Recalling the CPC reports on CMM201004 implementation at the seventh meeting of the WCPFCs Northern Committee NC7 there is considerable harvesting of Pacific Bluefin Tuna without implementation of the appropriate management measures that meet the required CMM conditions due to the current exemptions contained in the PBT CMM
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,24,WWF TRAFFIC Statement to the WCPFC 8 Regular Session Guam 2630 March 2012 6
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,25,WWF TRAFFIC call on WCPFC to remove all current exemptions from CMM201004 by 2012 and all fishing nations to implement the substantial management measures for juvenile age03 PBT to keep fishing mortality of PBT to no more than its 20022004 fishing mortality level 4 South Pacific Albacore
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,26,WWF and TRAFFIC recognise the legitimate aspirations of SIDS to increase the value from tuna fisheries in their exclusive economic zones There is however considerable concern about the rapid growth in the longline fleet in the Western and Central Pacific Of the total South Pacific Albacore SPA catch of 000 tonnes 2010 Chinese and Chinese Taipei catch has increased from 24000 20002004 to 000 tonnes
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,27,This growth in effort is leading to localised depletion of the adult stock and the increased effort south of S on the juvenile migrating stock is contributing to a reduction in biomass This is occurring as the stock rapidly approaches MSY levels The effectiveness of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC Conservation and Management Measure CMM 200502 as amended in 2010 to protect the southern Albacore stock is now questionable albeit that the scientists still maintain that the stock remains within biological limits
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,28,While recognising the legitimate aspirations of SIDS within a robust and responsible sustainability framework to develop domestic fisheries as required under CMM 200502201005 anecdotal industry evidence indicates that there is a serious problem with overlicencing in a number of WCPO SIDS
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,29,WWF and TRAFFIC recognise the efforts that have been made to strengthen the management strategy for the albacore longline fishery But there is an urgent need to introduce effective capacity limits and effort management for SPA Regional Observer Program ROP WWF TRAFFIC noted in our WCPFC7 joint statement that there was no current impediment to 100 observer coverage on support vessels such as that currently in place on purse seine vessels while observer coverage for longliners should be phased in The following timetable should be pursued as a 3year phasein of 100 Regional Observer Programme ROP coverage for all fishing vessels o 2011 All support vessels resupply refueling reefers for all high seas fishing have 100 ROP coverage o 2011 20 of all longliners including at least one from each flag state have an ROP observer on board o 2012 50 of all longliners including more than half of all vessels from each flag state have an ROP observer on board and o 2013 100 of all longliners have an ROP observer on board WWF TRAFFIC Statement to the WCPFC 8 Regular Session Guam 2630 March 2012 7
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,30,It is disappointing that very little progress on the above time table for implementation has been progressed or achieved Observer coverage is a priority and greater support should be given to the relevant authority to see that the capacity of the ROP is strengthened Fisheries are a priority revenue earner for many countries in the Pacific and as such must be given the recognition they deserve in terms of strengthening conservation and management capacity Furthermore along with compliance issues the increasing scrutiny by international markets of supply can be much better addressed if there is transparent information Without a doubt observers are a key link in this information chain
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,31,WWF TRAFFIC consider the presence of observers on every fishing and support vessel as fundamental to fishing best practices and call for a comprehensive and strong Regional Observer Program with 100 coverage of all fishing vessels including both catching and support vessels WWF TRAFFIC call upon the WCPFC to meet the 100 ROP target by 2013 Catch Documentation Scheme WWF TRAFFIC consider the failure to implement a catch documentation scheme CDS as a significant problem The WCPFC must take urgent action to address overfishing and to support and enforce that action by introducing a CDS WWF TRAFFIC recognize that the introduction of a CDS will pose some challenges to the WCPFC given the nature of tuna fisheries However WCPFC needs to ensure that all fish stocks managed by this RFMO are subject to the CDS as a proactive precautionary measure
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,32,WWF TRAFFIC recommends the adoption of a CDS measure for at least the five key tuna species4 with a date of implementation to be agreed and
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,33,A to the implementation of a CDS that requires documentation to accompany all catch harvested landed transshipped traded domestically exported processed imported and reexported and which relies on electronic documentation The CDS should not exclude any catches landings or trade as is common in schemes which are trade based rather than catch document schemes One only has to look to the lessons learnt by the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna CCSBT which has switched from a trade based scheme to a CDS due to the trade scheme allowing for substantial over catches by one of its members as a result of the trade scheme not being inclusive of all catches landings or trade B that complementary measures are in place to maximize the effectiveness of the CDS by C ensuring that transshipment at sea does not compromise the effectiveness of the CDS D adopting Port State measures consistent with the global Port State Measures Aagreement to take effect at the same time as the tuna CDS and E adopting measures that provide for traderestrictions to be used against flag States with vessels on the IUU list Bigeye Tuna Yellowfin Tuna Albacore Tuna Skipjack Tuna Pacific Bluefin Tuna WWF TRAFFIC Statement to the WCPFC 8 Regular Session Guam 2630 March 2012 8
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,34,F acknowledging the need to implement CDS for other species of tunas billfish and sharks managed by the Commission G a commitment to continuous improvement of the CDS by investigating the benefits and feasibility of verification systems such as tagging and the use of biotechnology H the establishment a capacity development fund to act as a costsharing mechanism to enable for cross subsidising across wealthy and lesswealthy members to ensure effective implementation and administration of the CDS and I maximizing retailer and public access to CDS data through modern online tools Mitigation of Bycatch Impacts
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,35,WWF and TRAFFIC believe that WCPFC must o take immediate management action to avoid bycatch interactions and to mitigate the impact of those interactions o task the relevant scientificecosystem body to improve bycatch related information and strengthen the longterm management about bycatch levels and mitigation options o review and revise management actions on bycatch as information increases and take action to strengthen their capacity to manage and monitor compliance with conservation and management measures
WCPFC8-2011-OP06,36,A number of environmental NGOs including WWF and TRAFFIC have developed a Compendium 2011 best practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the bycatch species taxonomic groups Four CMMs have been prepared on the basis of the best available scientific advice and taking into account current practice within tuna RFMOs The CMMs cover the following four taxonomic groups o Seabirds o Sharks o Sea turtles o Marine mammals Conclusion The responsibility of the WCPFC is clearly laid out as is the expectation for the sustainable management of fisheries resources within its mandate The lack of or need for strengthening certain measures are undermining sustainability in the WCPO and need to be addressed urgently WWF TRAFFIC call on the Commission to act quickly on the issues raised above for a sustainable future

WCPFC8-2011-OP11,1,COMMISSION EIGHTH REGULAR SESSION Tumon Guam USA 30 March 2012 Shark statement to WCPFC8 from Shark Advocate International Humane Society International and Project Aware Foundation 2012 WCPFC8 2011OP11 March 2012
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,2,Position Statement for the 8th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Guam 2630 March 2012
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,3,Shark Advocates International Humane Society International and Project AWARE Foundation appreciate the opportunity to express our views on key shark conservation issues under consideration by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,4,Our organizations maintain a special focus on shark conservation due in large part to the low reproductive capacity that leaves most shark species exceptionally vulnerable to overexploitation We commend the WCPFC for identifying key shark species and dedicating resources to the comprehensive scientific investigation and assessment of regional shark populations and related fishery impacts We believe that this remarkable work sets the WCPFC apart from most Regional Fishery Management Organizations RFMOs and serves as a sound basis for conservation action We are deeply concerned however that an estimated 7 or less of the shark catch in the Western Central Pacific Ocean WCPO is controlled through domestic catch limits and that the WCPFC unlike most other RFMOs has yet to adopt speciesspecific shark conservation measures
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,5,Our specific concerns and sciencebased recommendations are detailed below
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,6,Oceanic Whitetip Sharks Strong evidence of the serious depletion of oceanic whitetip sharks Carcharhinus longimanus in the WCPO substantiates the need for immediate conservation action To that end our organizations strongly support the United States proposal that WCPFC Members Cooperating NonMembers and Participating Territories CCMs prohibit the retention transshipment storage onboard sale and landing of oceanic whitetip sharks and require that captured individuals of this species are promptly and carefully released while ensuring that such interactions are reported in terms of number and status of animals
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,7,We believe this proposal is in line with the recommendation from the 7th Regular Session of the WCPFC Scientific Committee SC7 for consideration of mitigation measures to reduce fishing mortality on oceanic whitetip sharks in the Convention Area The US proposal is also consistent with the 2011InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission Resolution for the same species in international waters of the Eastern Pacific Ocean
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,8,The once common oceanic whitetip shark is increasingly rare in the regions tropical fisheries Scientific analyses prepared by the Secretariat of the Pacific Communitys Oceanic Fisheries Programme SPCOFP for SC7 based on multiple datasets documented clear steep declines in oceanic whitetip abundance catch rates to nearzero levels and size
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,9,Using observer data on shark condition and fate to compute expected mortality by species under various mitigation scenarios an SPCOFP analysis estimated that no retention policies would reduce mortality to 3060 of current levels depending on species and that requirements for prompt release unharmed may secure an additional 1020 reduction in mortality for certain species including oceanic whitetips The paper concludes that a no retention with prompt release unharmed measure for oceanic whitetip sharks would appear to be an appropriate and effective response to recent findings on the depleted status of the oceanic whitetip stock
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,10,The same analysis notes that existing information does not allow a conclusion regarding the sufficiency of this measure for oceanic whitetip stock recovery As such we also stress our support for the SC plan to prioritize this species for further investigation of fishery impacts and to conduct a stock assessment on oceanic whitetip sharks for SC8
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,11,Whale Sharks We are deeply concerned that an estimated 75 whale sharks Rhincodon typus were killed as a result of interactions with the regions purse seine fishery in just two years 2009 and Whale sharks are classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN as globally Vulnerable and listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species CITES and the Convention on Migratory Species CMS The lifetime value of a single whale shark to Belize tourism was estimated at more than 2 million US dollars while whale shark tourism worldwide has been estimated at nearly 50 million
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,12,Based on these factors our organizations strongly support Australias proposal to ban deliberate setting of purse seine nets on whale sharks to mitigate the impact of inadvertent encirclement and to require logbook and observer reporting of all interactions to the flag State and to the Commission We also support the adoption of best practice guidelines for safe release of encircled animals These actions are in line with advice from SC7 and together with obligations under national regulations CITES and CMS should go a long way toward comprehensively managing fishery impacts on this globally threatened and economically important species
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,13,Blue Sharks The WCPFC SC has recommended that the WCPFC8 consider mitigation measures for blue sharks Prionace glauca in the north Pacific We share scientists concern over recent substantial declines in blue shark catch rates revealed in four different North Pacific datasets in the face of unregulated targeting of the species by a large commercial fleet Analyses prepared for SC7 suggest that this population may no longer be above the biomass level associated with Maximum Sustainable Yield and that simple catch limits in combination with improved finning controls see next section are warranted as a first step toward reducing blue shark mortality in the North Pacific We urge the WCPFC8 to adopt such measures to prevent further depletion of the population We also support the SC plan to conduct a blue shark stock assessment for SC9
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,14,Shark Finning Analyses prepared by the SPCOFP for SC7 reveal that as of 2010 half of the WCPFC CCMs had not yet confirmed that the 2007 WCPFC ban on shark finning slicing off a sharks fins and discarding the body at sea is being fully implemented in national waters and even fewer have provided details related to application of and compliance with the 5 finto carcass weight ratio limit While the proportion of sharks finned in purse seine fisheries is decreasing observer data provide no evidence that the WCPFC finning ban has reduced the proportion of sharks finned in longline fisheries SPCOFP analyses point to stronger finning controls as a means to reduce excessive shark mortality
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,15,Our organizations along with most other conservationists and scientists worldwide strongly support the fins naturally attached method as the most reliable means for enforcing finning bans Under such a policy through which atsea fin removal is prohibited
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,16,Enforcement burden is greatly reduced Information on species and quantities of sharks landed is vastly improved Highgrading mixing bodies and fins from different animals is impossible Value of the finished product can be increased
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,17,The technique of making a partial cut allowing fins to be folded against the body can address industry concerns about safety and efficient storage Because of the numerous practical advantages associated with the fins naturally attached method the policy has been mandated for most Central American and US fisheries and is gaining acceptance in international arenas as reflected in
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,18,The 2007 United Nations General Assembly Sustainable Fisheries Resolution The 2008 IUCN Global Policy against Shark Finning The 2010 Fish Stocks Agreement Review Conference on the Law of the Sea
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,19,In order to increase the effectiveness of the regional shark finning ban and to facilitate the collection of speciesspecific shark catch data we urge the WCPFC to adopt a requirement that sharks be landed with their fins still naturally attached
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,20,Other Shark Species and Mitigation Measures We note that improvements in finning controls and simple catch limits have also been suggested in SPCOFP analyses for silky sharks Carcharhinus falciformis as a first step toward reducing mortality Although the species status has been described as ambiguous silky sharks are dominant in the shark catch of both longline and purse seine fisheries in the region and scientists suggest the number of removals may be on the rise We also support the SC plan to conduct a stock assessment on silky sharks for SC8
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,21,Two mako species Isurus spp and three species of threshers Alopias spp are considered key shark species by the WCPFC and are among the least productive of all pelagic sharks WCPFC scientists have suggested further research andor data improvement to identify and clarify population status trends for these species We support this recommendation as well as precautionary limits on take We also support the SC7 recommendation for further investigations into the effectiveness of shark catch mitigation measures such as circle hook use promotion of live release deeper hook deployment and prohibitions on targeting retention wire leaders and finning
WCPFC8-2011-OP11,22,We join the SC encouraging adoption of the process for designating WCPFC key shark species for data provision and assessment as proposed in document WCPFC8 2011IP05 as well as general improvements in the collection of shark related data

WCPFC8-2011-OP19,3,First the American Fishermens Research Foundation AFRF and its supporting organization of albacore troll fishermen and their marine suppliers the Western Fishboat Owners Association WFOA would like to thank the Secretariat of the WCPFC and the members of the WCPFC for permitting AFRF to participate in this meeting as an Observer Secondly AFRF would like to thank all of Guam but in particular the Guam Fishermens Association for their hospitality and assistance The primary area of concern for AFRF and WFOA at this meeting was a proposed amendment to the CMM 201005 submitted by the Forum Fisheries Agency Unfortunately the press of other business did not enable the Commission to discuss this request until the afternoon of the last day of the annual meeting This prevented the Commission members from having a full discussion of this item which AFRF would have welcomed There was no consensus reached on the FFA proposal Since the FFA declared that it would be bringing to the 9th Annual meeting of the Commission and one assumes the TCC8 and the SC8 a CMM which would seek to limit effort and catch on South Pacific albacore across all gear types AFRF looks forward to working with members of the WCPFC and participating Observers to reach an reasonable conclusion Unlike this meeting AFRF hopes to be consulted early in the process of crafting a new CMM by the interested members of the WCPFC As many of you know AFRF is a nonprofit foundation which is devoted to scientific research and public education for North and South Pacific albacore troll and pole and line fisheries It is also an advocate for the sustainable use of this resource and its conservation and management based on the best available science AFRF is a qualified Observer to both the WCPFC and the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission and attends all their meetings as well as meetings of the Northern Committee of
WCPFC8-2011-OP19,4,the WCPFC In addition AFRF and WFOA have been deeply involved with the WCPFC since the early days of the MHLC process in the 1990s through the meetings of the Preparatory Commission until the present day of the MHLC This has been a costly and resource consuming effort over the years Generally AFRF and WFOA have been unable to also attend meetings of the TCC and the SC For this reason AFRF and WFOA hope that they may be electronically connected with any meetings of the members and observers who work on the pending CMM whether at the TCC SC or in the interim On the off hand chance that such participation is denied AFRF would like to state a few principles for the record First AFRF believes CMMS should only be based on the best scientific information available At this time that information indicates South Pacific albacore is not overfished nor is overfishing occurring The stocks of South Pacific albacore are above MSY The troll and pole and line fishery for South Pacific albacore is having no discernible effect on the stocks The troll and pole and line fishery has shown no appreciable expansion since 2005 When 200503 was accepted by the Commission there was no scientific basis to limit the troll and pole and line South Pacific albacore fishery Secondly AFRF and WFOA both believe it is important for the SPC to at least perform triannual assessments on the stock if not more frequently Thirdly these organizations believe the establishment of target and limit reference points is an extremely important goal Finally both organizations believe additional life history and other research should be done on an urgent basis

Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 i WWF POSITION WWF POSITIONth Regular Session of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 Introduction and Summary The World Wide Fund for Nature WWF would like to thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC 1 for the opportunity to address the 9th Regular Session of the WCPFC on its critically important role in the adequate management of the Western Central Pacific Ocean WCPO fisheries Conservation of these ecologically and economically important fishery resources depends heavily on the ability of the members of the WCPFC to collaboratively work together to develop and implement successful conservation and management measures The regulatory measures proposed and implemented by the WCPFC represent one of the legs of the threelegged stool of successful sustainable and responsible fisheries management the other legs consisting of the science provided by the Scientific Committee SC and the compliance measures provided by the Technical and Compliance Committee TCC Without firm support on each one of those three components the stool falls over and fisheries management fails WWF once again calls on members of the WCPFC to address the issues and recommendations raised at SC8 TCC8 and WCPFC8 as well as observe the experience of other RFMOs in their own efforts to achieve and maintain improved measures for monitoring and surveillance WWF wishes to reiterate its position offered in Guam in March WCPFC8 and taking into account the WCPFCrelated meetings held since the recommendations listed in bullets below For more detail and background on each position please reference the associated Appendix for this document Conservation and Management Measures Reference Points WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Adopt precautionary Bbased Limit Reference Points preferably based on Spawning Biomass for all WCPO fishery stocks under its authority Adopt precautionary Fbased Limit Reference Points as an interim measure to attempt to control the exploitation rate Direct the SC to develop a range of alternatives for precautionary Target Reference Points for consideration in 2014 and Consider risk probability levels of breaching the Limit Reference Points of 10 or less as a precautionary measure Smart Fishing Initiative POSITION DECEMBER Gregg Yan WWF WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 ii WWF POSITION Harvest Control Rules WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Thoroughly review the SC8 recommendations for HCRs and the outcomes of the Management Objectives Workshop and Urgently pursue development and implementation of Harvest Control Rules for all stocks under its authority to be achieved by 2015 Harvest Strategies WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Develop strong sciencebased Harvest Strategies to be implemented simultaneously with the development of precautionary Reference Points and Harvest Control Rules High Seas Closures WWF recommends that the WCPFC should Develop a program to treat the HSPs as Special Management Zones SMZ subject to mutually agreed rules and measures contingent upon strict reporting and observation requirements by the WCPFC Consider a Vessel Days at Sea VDStype scheme specific to HSPs which would count against the overall effort of the CCM Rescind the waiver of the FAD closure on the domestic purse seine fisheries offered to CCMs displaced from the HSP closure areas upon transition of those areas to SMZs and Require all CCMs allowed to reenter the HSPs to implement complementary measures to the revised CMM 200801 enacted at WCPFC9 in addition to an equivalent compliance and monitoring scheme applicable to the domestic purse seine fisheries Tuna Species Bigeye Tuna WWF supports the SC8 recommendation for development of a revised CMM for BET YFT and SKJ tuna stocks Consistent with this recommendation the WCPFC must Adapt and adopt management measures that apply to all sectors of the fishery Further strengthen the control of FAD activities Build on the apparent success of some fleets in reducing their dependence on FADs to achieve greater control of FAD activity outside the closures including control of the number of FADs set throughout a year instead of FAD time closures Implement an absolute reduction of the total number of FAD sets to the levels no greater than those in the fishery in 2010 Clearly define limits on purse seine effort that are applicable in different areas Implement measures which reduce fishing mortality on BET from the longline fishery and Consider a complete closure of the purse seine fishery for a defined period of time during the highest catch or catch rates of juvenile BET including any mitigation measures necessary to address adverse socioeconomic impacts Yellowfin Tuna WWF recommends that the WCPFC take proactive and precautionary measures to prevent any further decline of the YFT stock and that WCPFC must Implement the SC7 recommendation to the WCPFC to limit YFT fishing mortality to its 20012004 level in the western equatorial region Pacific Bluefin Tuna WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Revise CMM201004 and remove all current exemptions from CMM201004 and Encourage all member states to implement the substantial management measures for juvenile age 03 PBT to keep fishing mortality less than its 20022004 level WWFPANDAORGSMARTFISHING Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 iii WWF POSITION South Pacific Albacore Tuna WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Introduce effective capacity and effort controls for management of the South Pacific ALB stock and Encourage domestic fisheries managers to implement Tuna Management Plans that freeze licenses for ALB at current levels and seek to reduce that number to a level that achieves Maximum Economic Yield Bycatch Whale Sharks WWF recommends that the WCPFC should Acknowledge the SC8 conclusion that whale sharks meet the criteria for consideration as a key shark species and define whale sharks as a key shark species Adopt Australias Proposal to Address the Impact of Purse Seine Fishing Activity on Whale Sharks which includes a specific prohibition for setting purse seines on whale sharks Support procedures for the careful and safe release of whale sharks inadvertently captured in purse seines Recommend requirements for logbook and observer reporting of all interactions with whale sharks for submission to the flag State and to the WCPFC Encourage the development of reference points for nontarget species including whale sharks as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Oceanic Whitetip and Silky Sharks Based on the recommendations of the SC8 regarding oceanic whitetip and silky sharks the WCPFC must Endorse additional mitigation measures and maintain existing measures in an effort to improve the status of the WCPO oceanic whitetip and silky shark stocks including o prohibit the retention transhipment storage onboard sale and landing of oceanic whitetip and silky sharks in all fisheries managed by the WCPFC o mandate the prompt and careful release of any captured oceanic whitetip and silky sharks and o ensure that all interactions with oceanic whitetip and silky sharks are reported in terms of number and status of animals through logbooks and observer records Develop and implement reference points for nontarget species including oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPFC Convention Shark Finning WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Focus more discretely on the overall management of shark harvests including the development and implementation of reference points for nontarget species as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPFC Convention Support and promote the collection of speciesspecific shark catch data in the WCPO through observer records and logbooks Implement a requirement for all sharks be landed whole with their fins naturally attached allowing for a partial cut method to facilitate safety and storage and Until such time a fins attached policy is enacted implement a prohibition on the transfer of any unattached shark fins at sea Turtles WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Formally acknowledge the deficiencies of CMM 200803 Adopt the sea turtle conservation and management measures proposed by WWF in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs Develop and implement CMM revisions aimed at o Strengthening key language and reducing the ambiguity in desired outcomes of the CMM thereby enabling not only stronger conservation measures but also better monitoring of CMM effectiveness WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 iv WWF POSITION o Committing explicitly to a goal of zero mortality of sea turtles and catch rates as close to zero as possible o Introducing new interim binding measures including mandatory adoption of bycatch reduction gear eg circle hooks and other mitigation techniques conducting research on mitigation techniques and reporting on sea turtle impacts with a goal of later implementing a consolidated optimal bycatch mitigation package o Setting an appropriate interim catch rate that would trigger moveon provisions and o Taking appropriate actions to ensure observer coverage in the longline fleet reaches recommended minimum levels with a view to progressively phase in 100 observer coverage Revive efforts to ensure the appropriate monitoring and documentation of compliance with CMM 2008 9and any revisions to the CMM ensuring that member countries are meeting minimum data collection and surveillance requirements and Reconstitute efforts to clearly communicate the ecological and economic benefits of circle hook adoption and sea turtle mitigation techniques to CCMs and their fleets Seabirds WWF recommends that the WCPFC should Adopt the seabird conservation measures recommended by ACAP as the best practice for longline operations including the use of weighted branch lines night setting and bird scaring tori lines Endorse the use of 2 out of 3 of the seabird bycatch best practices on all longline vessels fishing south ofS and Consider implementation of the seabird bycatch best practices throughout the WCPFC CA where incidence of seabird interaction warrants mitigation measures Monitoring and Compliance Catch Documentation System As part of the CDS development WWF requests that the WCPFC consider certain key features of a good CDS system including A requirement for electronic documentation to accompany all catch harvested landed transhipped traded domestically exported processed imported and reexported Complementary measures to maximize the effectiveness of the CDS through o ensuring that transhipment at sea does not compromise the effectiveness of the CDS o adopting Port State Measures implemented simultaneously with the CDS and o adopting trade restriction measures against flag States with vessels on the IUU list Parameters that include all species of tunas billfish and sharks managed by the WCPFC A commitment to continuous improvement of the CDS by investigating the benefits and feasibility of verification systems such as electronic tagging and the use of biotechnology Establishment of a capacity development fund to provide a costsharing mechanism that enables progressive cost sharing among member states and Maximizing retailer and public access to data through modern electronic tools Regional Observer Programme With respect to the continued implementation and operation of the ROP the WCPFC must Implement a binding consistent and consolidated set of standards for the ROP Conduct a phased implementation of 100 observer coverage on all fishing and support vessels Revise the Observer Provider Code of Conduct to create more substantive requirements on Observer Providers and recipients including the implementation of a schedule of fines and sanctions for non compliance to be applicable to throughout the WCPFC CA Develop and implement strong set of Minimum Observer Health Safety and Welfare Standards to be applicable to all vessels operating throughout the WCPFC CA Develop and implement a standardized administrative review system to address observer grievances that is empowered to impose sanctions andor penalties on offending vessel owners captains masters andor crew who engage in bribery threats intimidation or harassment of any kind against an observer which would otherwise impede them from conducting their official duties and WWFPANDAORGSMARTFISHING Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 v WWF POSITION Implement a Conservation and Management Measure stating that any finding from an administrative review that confirms an instance of bribery threats intimidation or harassment of an observer constitutes an IUU violation resulting in the vessel on which the offense occurred being placed on the IUU list Consider EM in situations deemed appropriate for enforcement and monitoring goals specific to those vessels Reconstitute the Data Consultative Committee DCC to address current data issues in the ROP including consideration of o Revisions of data fields for nontarget species to include detailed entries for seabirds turtles and sharks broken out by species in all observer reporting submissions and o Removal of redundant duplicative or otherwise obsolete data fields and Develop a more comprehensive analysis and design plan for spatially and temporally representative observer coverage of each fishery operating in the WCPFC CA IUU Measures The WCPFC must maintain strong procedures for identifying listing and retaining IUU vessels on IUU Lists to ensure that the integrity of the WCPO fisheries including Ensuring the burden of proof must always remain with the IUU offender to explicitly prove through appropriate documentation WCPFC CMM 201006 paragraph 25 ae that all obligations have been met before being removed from an IUU list Maintaining the current definition of IUU fishing for the purpose of the IUU list and Ensuring that sanctions of adequate severity are always onerous enough to prevent deter and eliminate any future IUU conduct and not just a cost of doing business Data and Statistics WWF recommends that the WCPFC should Repeat the request for CCMs who have yet to provide operational level catch and effort data provide Data Improvement Plans to the WCPFC and Request that until operational catcheffort data are provided noncompliant CCMs must provide annual catch estimates by gear and species for waters of national jurisdiction and high seas areas separately as per the scientific data provision rules of the WCPFC Miscellaneous Cost Recovery and Optimization WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Oppose the implementation of a fee for observers to attend WCPFC meetings Conclusion WWF once again calls on the WCPFC to look carefully look at our collective conduct as nations with a responsibility for managing fishery resources in the WCPFC CA With respect to each of the agenda items addressed at the WCPFC9 Regular Meeting the commission delegates must genuinely consider whether previous actions have been responsible and commendable in achieving the overarching goal of fisheries sustainability in the WCPO The WCPFC shares the distinction as the youngest RFMO but is also regarded as arguably the most effective However we all must constantly guard against the complacency and greed that leads to poor decisionmaking resulting in the collapsing fish stocks in other regions Unfortunately with some stocks in the WCPO such as bigeye tuna and oceanic whitetip sharks we are treading dangerously down a path leading to trouble The WCPFC possesses the ability and opportunity to chart the course towards sustainable fishery resources especially tuna in the WCPO The WCPFC and its subsidiary bodies must continually promote and adopt strong and effective conservation and management action to maintain and rebuild tuna stocks implement appropriate monitoring and enforcement measures promote a viable tuna industry and support vibrant coastal

Regular Session of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 Conservation and Management Measures WWF applauds the recent efforts of managers to seek the development and implementation of effective science based Harvest Strategies Harvest Control Rules and Reference Points HSHCRRP Stock assessments used to estimate the amount of fish in a particular stock and the rate of fishing on that stock throughout the region has continually improved WWF encourages the WCPFC to urgently pursue the implementation of these management measures as a way to reduce the logistical burden on managers while streamlining the management process and in turn ensuring the sustainability of WCPO fisheries To assist this effort WWF has created a simplified explanation of these basic management measures for distribution at this meeting Reference Points The WCPFC must formally adopt explicit Limit and Target Reference Points LTRPs for all WCPO fishery stocks under its authority Implementation of these formally designated LTRPs represents an absolute priority for the sustainable management of the fishery resources in the WCPO Existing science supports the implementation of welldefined and precautionary biologicallybased Limit Reference Points and WWF generally supports the recommendations of the SC While Target Reference Points require additional consideration of socioeconomic considerations current understanding of the biological and socioeconomic conditions does not prevent the implementation of sufficiently precautionary interim Target Reference Points at this time While LTRPs are needed in all fisheries the WCPFC should prioritise the implementation of LTRPs in at least the four key tuna species including skipjack SKJ albacore ALB bigeye BET and yellowfin YFT at this time Very simply reference points provide management decisionmakers an objective tool to determine whether a fish stock size is becoming too small or fishing pressure is becoming too great WWF notes that the WCPFC has discussed and considered reference points since 2006 and that while the SC has made several recommendations to the WCPFC on appropriate reference points the WCPFC has failed to adopt formal explicit reference points Nonetheless while stock assessments conducted by SPC use BMSY and FMSY as Limit Reference Points and provide advice to the WCPFC more explicit reference points are justified based on the available scientific information At the recent SC8 meeting in Busan one CCM expressed a preference for fishing mortalitybased ie Fbased Limit Reference Points justified by the perception that 1 fishing mortality is a parameter that the WCPFC controls 2 they are more likely to be robust against changes in recruitment and 3 they require less information about the biological responses of tunas especially at lower biomass2 While this may be relevant to tunas in this region which have not been fished down to very low levels it fails to recognize inherent vulnerabilities to the application of such a measure despite perceived aboveaverage resilience and associated SPR values While simply managing to a default MSY as a natural Limit Reference Point may seem appealing because it results in a perceived optimum level of depletion it also results in a potential failure of the management system to respond in a timely and effective way An Fbased Limit Reference Point is indeed designed to control fishing capacity or in other words the rate at which the harvest influences the stock size However under the existing management regime managing solely under an F Smart Fishing Initiative POSITION Gregg Yan WWF WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION based model leaves too much room for delay in action and as a result fails to respond adequately to changes in stock size or fishing pressure For example there is typically two years between stock assessments in all WCPO fisheries In that two year time period assume that the fleet capacity either through size or efficiency expands substantially Due to the timing of the stock assessments and data availability for the meetings it could be three years or more before the WCPFC will be capable of addressing the unsustainably increased fishing mortality This dynamic can result in a severe overshoot of mortality resulting in the need for substantial painful retractions of effort and significant rebuilding measures While the uncertainties associated with biomass Bbased Limit Reference Points make them a less attractive option to some stakeholders they constitute a critical tool to ensure that stock sustainability is ensured Fbased Limit Reference Points are important and useful but not as critical as a Bbased limit because a Bbased limit ensures a biological floor that the fishery cannot go below In March 2012 WCPFC8 endorsed the hierarchical approach to identifying Limit Reference Points and tasked the Scientific Services Provider with preparing proposed Limit Reference Points for the consideration of SC8 As stated in WWFs Position Statement to WCPFC8 2012 WWF strongly urges the WCPFC to formally adopt Limit and Target Reference Points The adoption of explicitly determined Limit and Target Reference Points for at least the four key tuna species namely SKJ ALB YFT and BET is an absolute priority for the sustainable management of these resources in the WCPO WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Adopt precautionary Bbased Limit Reference Points3 preferably based on Spawning Biomass4 for all WCPO fishery stocks under its authority Adopt precautionary Fbased Limit Reference Points as an interim measure to attempt to control the exploitation rate5 Direct the SC to develop a range of alternatives for precautionary Target Reference Points for consideration in 2014 and Consider risk probability levels of breaching the Limit Reference Points of 10 or less as a precautionary measure Harvest Control Rules Under the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement Convention article 5c the precautionary approach6 became a basic element of sustainable fisheries management Globally countries and regional organizations have adopted the measure as a matter of domestic and international law supporting prudent fisheries management The measure was also specifically included in the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries serving as a guidepost for sustainable fisheries management Furthermore the measure appears prominently in the FAO Guidelines for ecolabelling and is a critical element for consideration in ecolabelling certification schemes such as the Marine Stewardship Council MSC It is possible to make the implementation of a precautionary approach operational through preagreed management actions or specifically Harvest Control Rules that trigger management actions when stock status indicators reach predefined Reference Points Currently no explicit Harvest Control Rules exist in the WCPFC The WCPFC currently bases management on implied reference points informed by basic catch and effort data lengthfrequency and tagging data Limited management actions include limiting fishing effort through various ad hoc input controls such as the PNAs Vessel Day Scheme VDS closure of high seas pockets FAD closures and implementation of capacity limits primarily driven by concerns for BET and YFT Therefore the absence of formally agreed Harvest Control Rules is necessary for the WCPFC to fully implement management best practices At its most basic a Harvest Control Rule is simply a preagreed action or set of actions to be taken by a management body that are designed to achieve a medium or longterm Target Reference Point while avoiding reaching a Limit Reference Point Simple Harvest Control Rules can be described as an if then statement An example of a very simple Harvest Control Rule would be if the fishery stock level falls below the target level then the level of fishing must be reduced by 20 Managers may also agree in advance what the specific management actions are to reach that 20 reduction in the level of fishing such as a regional closure or gear restriction Implementing Reference Points as part of Harvest Control Rules puts in place clear decision rules which minimize excessive debate and allow managers to act quickly and decisively when the fishery reaches a predefined threshold eg Limit or Target Reference Point Furthermore Harvest Control Rules lay the foundation for developing well defined fisheries management plans that are grounded in sound science WWFPANDAORGSMARTFISHING Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION The WCPFC must develop and implement Harvest Control Rules HCRs consisting of explicit preagreed actions designed to achieve a medium or longterm Target Reference Point and avoiding reaching a Limit Reference Point while explicitly defining intended responses to changes in stock status Welldefined HCRs must seek consistency with the Harvest Strategy and ensure that the exploitation rate is reduced as a Limit Reference Points are approached while also considering a wide range of uncertainties in their design WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Thoroughly review the SC8 recommendations for HCRs and the outcomes of the Management Objectives Workshop and Urgently pursue development and implementation of Harvest Control Rules for all stocks under its authority to be achieved by 2015 Harvest Strategies A Harvest Strategy represents the basic guidelines that stipulate how managers go about setting general harvest levels or allowable fishing levels The choice of Harvest Strategy affects the yield from the fishery and the risk of overfishing Efforts to define Reference Points and Harvest Control Rules help to clearly inform the Harvest Strategy The current rudimentary Harvest Strategy employed in the WCPFC does not contain any Harvest Control Rules and as such does not reflect best practice The WCPFC must develop welldefined Harvest Strategies or Policies based on distinct preagreed Reference Points and Harvest Control Rules The Harvest Strategies should reflect clear guidelines that stipulate how managers set general harvest levels or allowable fishing levels Any Harvest Strategy considered must contain strong precautionary directives to ensure that stock size stays above the Limit Reference Point and ideally a Target Reference Point set to achieve Maximum Economic Yield A welldeveloped Harvest Strategy should also consider details of a rebuilding plan should a stock go below the Limit Reference Point WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Develop strong sciencebased Harvest Strategies to be implemented simultaneously with the development of precautionary Reference Points and Harvest Control Rules High Seas Closures In general WWF supports the implementation of conservation and management measures where the science indicates those measures represent important contributors to tuna conservation and the health of the ecosystem they depend upon However at this time there is insufficient scientific evidence to indicate the High Seas Pocket HSP closures in the WCPO have effectively contributed to tuna conservation and management Furthermore contrary evidence suggests that effort is ultimately displaced from the HSP closure areas where bycatch rates tend to be lower and into the nearshore EEZ areas where bycatch tends to be higher WWF notes the very limited impact of the high seas closures on the overall management of tunas in the WCPO as evidenced by the overall failure of CMM 200801 despite good adherence to the HSP closure reported by the SC87 WWF agrees with the SC8 recommendation that closing areastime entirely to purse seine fishing without consideration of the fate of displaced fishing effort will not be effective for BET conservation and less profitable to purse seine operations as a whole8 The High Seas Pockets HSPs require a unique approach that is applicable to all Members Cooperating NonMembers and Participating Territories CCMs WWF recommends that the WCPFC should Develop a program to treat the HSPs as Special Management Zones SMZ subject to mutually agreed rules and measures contingent upon strict reporting and observation requirements by the WCPFC Consider a Vessel Days at Sea VDStype scheme specific to HSPs which would count against the overall effort of the CCM Rescind the waiver of the FAD closure on the domestic purse seine fisheries offered to CCMs displaced from the HSP closure areas upon transition of those areas to SMZs and Require all CCMs allowed to reenter the HSPs to implement complementary measures to the revised CMM 200801 enacted at WCPFC9 in addition to an equivalent compliance and monitoring scheme applicable to the domestic purse seine fisheries WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION Tuna Species Bigeye Tuna WCPFC8 previously adopted CMM 201101 to ensure that measures remain applicable for 2011 under CMM 200801 with several noted exemptions until 28 February 20139 Assisted by the SPC SC8 reviewed the effectiveness of CMM 201101 to reduce fishing mortality of bigeye tuna BET the effectiveness of CMM 200801 and provided scientific advice to the WCPFC for the development of a revised CMM for BET YFT and SKJ tuna stocks SPC also approximated the impact of the various exemptions contained within CMM 200801 estimating that if the CMM was implemented without exemptions approximately half of the overfishing that is estimated could occur under the CMM as written could be removed reduction of BET FFMSY from 135 to 11710 The SC8 maintains that the catch of small BET YFT and SKJ can be significantly reduced by purse seines switching from FAD sets to unassociated sets11 Nonetheless the SC8 specifically noted that CMM200801 has not reduced the fishing mortality for BET to the level intended and supports the need for additional or alternative targeted measures to reduce the fishing mortality on BET12 Since a reduction in fishing mortality on BET has not reached the intended level additional targeted measures to reduce the fishing mortality on BET must be considered for all gear types Indeed the FFA member states emphatically support the need for additional or alternative targeted measures to reduce the fishing mortality on BET13 In the event that these additional measures continue to fail to adequately address BET mortality the WCPFC must consider even stronger measures andor fewer exemptions to the rules If overfishing of BET continues to occur the WCPFC must consider more extreme measures including a complete periodic closure to all purse seine fishing with no or at least very minimal exemptions For the closure to be meaningful the WCPFC must impose the closure around the time of the greatest catchcatch rates of juvenile BET and over a length of time sufficient to bring BET mortality near the reference point While it may seem drastic another RFMO has previously successfully used a complete periodic closure to control BET mortality The IATTC successfully implemented a similar measure to control the BET mortality within a small percentage of the reference point used in their management thereby proving its efficacy in an analogous situation WWF acknowledges that this action could potentially 
ave significant adverse socioeconomic impacts particularly on Small Island Developing States SIDS and recommends exploring mitigation measures as part of the consideration of such a measure Furthermore the complete closure would need to coincide with additional measures imposed on other gear types as well The WCPFC must support the SC8 recommendations for development of a revised CMM for BET YFT and SKJ tuna stocks Specifically the SC8 notes that the catch of small BET YFT and SKJ can be significantly reduced by purse seines switching from FAD sets to unassociated sets WWF supports the SC8 recommendation for development of a revised CMM for BET YFT and SKJ tuna stocks Consistent with this recommendation the WCPFC must Adapt and adopt management measures that apply to all sectors of the fishery Further strengthen the control of FAD activities Build on the apparent success of some fleets in reducing their dependence on FADs to achieve greater control of FAD activity outside the closures including control of the number of FADs set throughout a year instead of FAD time closures Implement an absolute reduction of the total number of FAD sets to the levels no greater than those in the fishery in 2010 Clearly define limits on purse seine effort that are applicable in different areas Implement measures which reduce fishing mortality on BET from the longline fishery and Consider a complete closure of the purse seine fishery for a defined period of time during the highest catch or catch rates of juvenile BET including any mitigation measures necessary to address adverse socioeconomic impacts Yellowfin Tuna Although the SPC did not conduct a stock assessment for YFT this year anecdotal accounts of continued declining CPUE indicate a corresponding decline in stock status warranting action to halt and reverse the declining trend WCPFC should observe the precautionary approach and support the SC7 recommendation to the WCPFC to limit YFT fishing mortality to its 20012004 level The conclusion provided in the SC7 Summary Report based on the most recent assessment of YFT 2011 in the WCPO indicates that overfishing is not occurring and that the stock is not in an overfished state However the stock assessment does continue to indicate a negative trend towards an WWFPANDAORGSMARTFISHING Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION overfished state that warrants a precautionary approach to the management of the stock Additionally reduced catch levels support additional measures as the WCPCA YFT catch for 2011 430506 mt 19 was the lowest since14 WWF recommends that the WCPFC take proactive and precautionary measures to prevent the further decline of the YFT stock WWF recommends that the WCPFC take proactive and precautionary measures to prevent any further decline of the YFT stock and that WCPFC must Implement the SC7 recommendation to the WCPFC to limit YFT fishing mortality to its 2001 level in the western equatorial region15 Pacific Bluefin Tuna CMM 201004 for Pacific Bluefin tuna requires member states to ensure that the total fishing effort by their vessels stays below the 200204 level for 2011 and 2012 This measure might be successful but for all of the exceptions carved out such that the exceptions become the rule While a minor exception for artisanal fisheries likely has a negligible effect the additional exceptions to the measures intended to reduce juvenile Bluefin tuna mortality to2004 levels confound the success of the CMM The WCPFC must remove all current exemptions from CMM04 and encourage all fishing nations to implement the substantial management measures for juvenile age03 PBT to keep fishing mortality of PBT to no more than its 20022004 fishing mortality level WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Revise CMM201004 and remove all current exemptions from CMM201004 and Encourage all member states to implement the substantial management measures for juvenile age 03 PBT to keep fishing mortality less than its 20022004 level South Pacific Albacore Tuna The SC7 noted in 2011 that harvest levels of the exploitable biomass has increased sharply in recent years raising concerns of potential overfishing in the near future and the need for additional restrictions of fishing mortality WWF remains concerned about the recent rapid and uncontrolled growth in the longline fleet throughout the WCPO Particularly this growth appears to be contributing to several adverse impacts to Southern ALB tuna and possible localised depletion of the adult stock in some areas Furthermore verifiable increased effort south of 20S on the juvenile migrating stock appears to be contributing to a reduction in biomass which is also resulting in the stock rapidly approaching MSY The SC8 confirmed that the WCPCA ALB longline catch for 2011 was the second highest on record 96219 mt but represents a 6000 mt decline from the 2010 record 102763 mt Meanwhile all fleets are reportedly currently experiencing significant reductions in catch per unit effort CPUE in response to the increase in adult fishing mortality thereby providing a strong indication of a drop in biomass Therefore the effectiveness of the WCPFC CMM 200502 as amended in 2010 to conserve the Southern ALB stock remains questionable While the current state of the Southern ALB stock remains within biological limits the goal of the WCPFC should be to keep it there rather than to allow a continued trend of decline in the fishery Furthermore WWF maintains substantial concerns that the persistent increase in ALB effort will also significantly impact other target species facing conservation concerns such as BET and YFT as well as sharks WWF supports the efforts of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community SPC Forum Fisheries Agency FFA Te Vaka Moana TVM the Parties to the Nauru Agreement PNA the Melanesian Spearhead Group MSG other Pacific Island Countries PICs with target ALB fisheries the Pacific Islands Tuna Industry Association PITIA and other nonaligned parties to strengthen the management strategy for the ALB longline fishery and to address the related species interaction issues WWF would specifically like to reemphasize the concerns expressed by the FFA at SC8 regarding the doubling of catch since 2000 declining CPUE and increase in effort including influx of vessels from the Indian Ocean increase in domestic fleet size and more high seas fishing for South Pacific ALB16 Measures aimed at introducing effective capacity limits and effort management must be urgently addressed by WCPFC and the regions domestic fisheries managers The following recommendations are consistent with the policy paper commissioned by WWF regarding South Pacific ALB tuna that was submitted to the WCPFC in March 201217 WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Introduce effective capacity and effort controls for management of the South Pacific ALB stock and WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION Encourage domestic fisheries managers to implement Tuna Management Plans that freeze licenses for ALB at current levels and seek to reduce that number to a level that achieves Maximum Economic Yield Bycatch WWF believes that WCPFC must take decisive management action to avoid and mitigate bycatch in all WCPO fisheries and ensure the relevant scientific body is able to improve bycatch related information through such tools as the Bycatch Management Information System BMIS WWF further recommends that the WCPFC strengthen the longterm management of bycatch levels and mitigation options including to review and revise management actions on bycatch as information increases as well as take action to strengthen capacity to manage and monitor compliance with conservation and management measures A group of environmental NGOs including WWF and TRAFFIC developed a Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the bycatch species taxonomic groups in 201118 The NGOs prepared four CMMs on the basis of the best available scientific advice and taking into account current practice within tuna RFMOs The proposed CMMs cover the following four taxonomic groups including seabirds sharks sea turtles and marine mammals WWF encourages the WCPFC to consider these proposed CMMs in its own approach to addressing bycatch issues Whale Sharks The whale shark is a tropical and warm temperate species the worlds largest living chondrichthyan and justifiably considered a charismatic megafauna Although scientists currently understand relatively little of its life history it is known to be highly fecund and to migrate extremely large distances However populations of whale shark continue to show a declining trend globally and the species is listed in Appendix II to the Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES Appendix II to the Convention for Migratory Species of Wild Animals CMS and as vulnerable in the International Union for the Conservation of Natures IUCN Red List The whale sharks high value in international trade a Kselected life history highly migratory nature and normally low abundance make this species especially vulnerable to commercial fishing activities Therefore the WCPFC must take steps to restrict activities that are detrimental to the continued health of the whale shark population in the WCPO It is well known that whale sharks are particularly vulnerable to being encircled by purse seine nets due to the propensity of tuna to form schools around them Additionally it has become well known that observer reports on fishing activities by vessels flagged to CCMs indicate numerous instances of interactions with whale sharks in addition to high mortality rates for encircled whale sharks and instances of misreporting whale shark interactions in vessel logbook19 At least 75 whale sharks were recorded as mortalities in the purse seine fishery in 2009 and 2010 alone20 Thus measures should be taken by the WCPFC to protect this ecologically important and vulnerable shark species Consistent with the recent actions of the PNA to prohibit setting of purse seines on cetaceans and whale sharks in their waters and Australias recommendation for a similar provision the WCPFC should adopt an explicit prohibition on the setting of purse seines on whale sharks WWF recommends that the WCPFC should Acknowledge the SC8 conclusion that whale sharks meet the criteria for consideration as a key shark species and define whale sharks as a key shark species Adopt Australias Proposal to Address the Impact of Purse Seine Fishing Activity on Whale Sharks which includes a specific prohibition for setting purse seines on whale sharks Support procedures for the careful and safe release of whale sharks inadvertently captured in purse seines Recommend requirements for logbook and observer reporting of all interactions with whale sharks for submission to the flag State and to the WCPFC Encourage the development of reference points for nontarget species including whale sharks as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Oceanic Whitetip and Silky Sharks At SC8 in Busan Korea the Scientific Services Provider offered strong scientific evidence that both oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks are currently overfished and subject to overfishing21 Thus existing management measures to reduce fishing mortality have insufficiently addressed the continuing decline of oceanic whitetip and silky sharks WWFPANDAORGSMARTFISHING Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION WCPFC has taken efforts to rebuild spawning biomass of oceanic whitetip sharks as agreed under CMM 201104 However managers and scientists note that additional mitigation measures to avoid capture and mortality of oceanic whitetip and silky sharks is warranted22 Based on the recommendations of the SC8 regarding oceanic whitetip and silky sharks the WCPFC must Endorse additional mitigation measures and maintain existing measures in an effort to improve the status of the WCPO oceanic whitetip and silky shark stocks including o prohibit the retention transhipment storage onboard sale and landing of oceanic whitetip and silky sharks in all fisheries managed by the WCPFC o mandate the prompt and careful release of any captured oceanic whitetip and silky sharks and o ensure that all interactions with oceanic whitetip and silky sharks are reported in terms of number and status of animals through logbooks and observer records Encourage the development of reference points for nontarget species including oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Shark Finning Shark finning is defined as the practice of removing the fins from a shark and discarding the carcass The WCPFC has already taken initial steps to regulate shark finning However recent research indicates that these efforts are largely inadequate as the practice of calculating a fin to carcass ratio allows fishermen to retain more high value fins through highgrading and hence fails to address the necessary management needs of many of the shark species which are currently subject to overfishing At least four independent studies show that a fin to carcass ratio fails to accurately assess removals and largely prevents the effective identification of shark species23 Furthermore the ultimate conclusion of a 2006 assessment of the validity of the 5 fintocarcass ratio from a collective volume of scientific papers produced by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ICCAT states that The only guaranteed method to avoid shark finning is to land sharks with all fins attached24 The WCPFC should strongly support the fins naturally attached method as the most reliable means for enforcing a shark finning ban A prohibition of atsea fin removals under a fins naturally attached policy Greatly reduces enforcement burden Substantially improves information on species and quantities of sharks landed Virtually eliminates the practice of highgrading where bodies and fins from different animals are mixed conflating prohibitions on the retention of certain species and Increases the value of the finished product Additionally making a partial cut that allows fins to be folded against the body has been proven to address industry concerns about safety and storage Because of the numerous practical advantages associated with the fins naturally attached method the policy has been mandated for most Central American and US fisheries and internationally More importantly WWF maintains concerns that too much focus is placed on finning measures WWF believes that finning prohibitions tend to divert attention from assessing the overall sustainability of shark harvests and that shark management should not be based on seemingly simple measures that lack even the potential for proper evaluation and enforcement25 WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Focus more discretely on the overall management of shark harvests including the development and implementation of reference points for nontarget species as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPFC Convention Support and promote the collection of speciesspecific shark catch data in the WCPO through observer records and logbooks Implement a requirement for all sharks be landed with their fins naturally attached allowing for a partial cut method to facilitate safety and storage and WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION Until such time a fins attached policy is enacted implement a prohibition on the transfer of any unattached shark fins at sea Turtles WWF believes that CMM 200803 for the Conservation and Management of Sea Turtles has not demonstrably reduced bycatch impacts on threatened and endangered sea turtles in the region and that the cumulative impact of longline vessels in the WCPO on sea turtles remains problematic Furthermore evidence suggests that the WCPFC and member states have not suitably monitored the CMM for effectiveness with some parts of the CMM distinguished as providing excessive room for creative compliance26 Although CMM 200803 requires all longline vessels to carry turtle dehookers and line cutters and to foster the animals recovery according to WCPFC handling and mitigation guidelines WCPFC has provided no documentation of the effectiveness of or compliance with this requirement despite the explicit identification of data collection and minimum surveillance resources27 Indeed in 2010 over three quarters of CCMs either did not report on compliance with CMM 200803 or did not meet all the CMM measures28 Furthermore only a small fraction of member countries have conducted dedicated research on sea turtle mitigation techniques and current observer coverage falls well below the recommended level for effectively determining optimal mitigation approaches ie 10 coverage over years The precautionary principle requires that all members must determine optimal bycatch mitigation strategies based on research and sound science With no evidence of CMM 200803 having slowed or reversed negative trends on threatened and endangered sea turtle populations the burden of proof remains on the WCPFC and the CCMs to demonstrate minimization of bycatch impacts in longline operations The best way to improve compliance with the CMM is to revise the CMM to ensure more suitable requirements for the determination of optimal bycatch mitigation packages for individual fisheries reduce the ambiguity in the language and improve the definition of the desired outcomes of the CMM WWF maintains that revisions to the CMM are necessary to better enable compliance and because we believe that substantial evidence exists that current measures have failed to minimize impacts on sea turtles under the current CMM thereby further obligating implementation of stronger measures Therefore WWF believes that CMM 200803 for the Conservation and Management of Sea Turtles has not demonstrably reduced bycatch impacts on threatened and endangered sea turtles in the region and that the cumulative impact of longline vessels in the WCPO on sea turtles remains problematic Thus with respect to sea turtles the WCPFC should Formally acknowledge the deficiencies of CMM 200803 Adopt the sea turtle conservation and management measures proposed by WWF in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs29 Develop and implement CMM revisions aimed at o Strengthening key language and reducing the ambiguity in desired outcomes of the CMM thereby enabling not only stronger conservation measures but also better monitoring of CMM effectiveness o Committing explicitly to a goal of zero mortality of sea turtles and catch rates as close to zero as possible o Introducing new interim binding measures including mandatory adoption of bycatch reduction gear eg circle hooks and other mitigation techniques conducting research on mitigation techniques and reporting on sea turtle impacts with a goal of later implementing a consolidated optimal bycatch mitigation package o Setting an appropriate interim catch rate that would trigger moveon provisions and o Taking appropriate actions to ensure observer coverage in the longline fleet reaches recommended minimum levels with a view to progressively phase in 100 observer coverage Revive efforts to ensure the appropriate monitoring and documentation of compliance with CMM 200803 9and any revisions to the CMM ensuring that member countries are meeting minimum data collection and surveillance requirements and Reconstitute efforts to clearly communicate the ecological and economic benefits of circle hook adoption and sea turtle mitigation techniques to CCMs and their fleets Seabirds WWF supports the advice from delegates of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels ACAP that the following seabird bycatch mitigation measures represent the current best practices WWFPANDAORGSMARTFISHING Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION weighted branch lines night setting bird scaring tori lines The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ICCAT and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission in November 2011 and April 2012 respectively passed new conservation measures that required member states to use 2 out of 3 seabird bycatch mitigation measures south of 25S in their areas of competence choosing between night setting birdscaring tori lines and line weighting The greatest areas of risk of the adverse effects of fishing mortality on seabird populations in the southern hemisphere of the WCPFC area occur from 25 toS particularly in the Tasman Sea30 WWF supports the SC8 recommendation that a combination of techniques should be used especially those including the best practices listed above that have proven most effective for reducing seabird bycatch of the prevalent seabirds in the regions of concern Additionally WWF supports the SC8 recommendation to include observer data fields on the mass of weight added to branch lines distance between weight and hook in meters the fate dead alive or injured and number of seabirds by species in each of these categories31 The WCPFC should reconsider analysis on the impacts of implementing seabird avoidance gear on vessels less than meters as it would be largely redundant in lieu of considerable research that has been conducted in other longline fisheries which proves vessels as small as 8 meters can successfully and economically deploy seabird avoidance gear32 As a bycatch species of concern in the WCPO WWF remains committed to reducing the capture and mortality of seabirds in the tuna longline fisheries WWF supports the recommendations of the Agreement on the Conservation of ACAP and the SC8 regarding seabird conservation Thus with respect to seabirds WWF recommends the WCPFC should Adopt the seabird conservation measures recommended by ACAP as the best practice for longline operations including the use of weighted branch lines night setting and bird scaring tori lines Endorse the use of 2 out of 3 of the seabird bycatch best practices on all longline vessels fishing south of 25S and Consider implementation of the seabird bycatch best practices throughout the WCPFC CA where incidence of seabird interaction warrants mitigation measures Monitoring and Compliance Catch Documentation Scheme WWF continues to believe that an efficient and comprehensive catch documentation scheme CDS is a necessary part of a wellmanaged fishery Good catch documentation is essential to proper fisheries management providing the data necessary for analyses as basic as stock assessments to the product traceability that seafood markets are increasingly demanding WWF supports the development and implementation of a comprehensive CDS and encourages the future development of the CDS by the WCPFC Overall WWF wishes to note that any CDS considered by the CDS working group must be fully comprehensive to be effective including documentation of all catches landings transfers and trade Other RFMOs provide relevant examples of CDS schemes that were not robust enough to provide adequate documentation For instance the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna CCSBT switched from a purely tradebased scheme to a more comprehensive CDS because the initial program allowed for substantial overharvest by one of its members resulting from the tradebased scheme not being inclusive of all catches landings and trade Thus any CDS considered by the CDS working group must include all catches landings transfers or trade part of the framework for the documentation schemes not just the tradebased information As part of the CDS development WWF requests that the WCPFC consider certain key features of a good CDS system including A requirement for electronic documentation to accompany all catch harvested landed transhipped traded domestically exported processed imported and reexported Complementary measures to maximize the effectiveness of the CDS through o ensuring that transhipment at sea does not compromise the effectiveness of the CDS WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION o adopting Port State Measures implemented simultaneously with the CDS and o adopting trade restriction measures against flag States with vessels on the IUU list Parameters that include all species of tunas billfish and sharks managed by the WCPFC A commitment to continuous improvement of the CDS by investigating the benefits and feasibility of verification systems such as electronic tagging and the use of biotechnology Establishment of a capacity development fund to provide a costsharing mechanism that enables progressive cost sharing among member states and Maximizing retailer and public access to data through modern electronic tools Regional Observer Programme Information collected as part of an appropriate observer programme is critically important to the proper management of a fishery Data collected by observers plays a central role in informing fisheries scientists on everything ranging from stock assessments to nontarget species impacts Furthermore observers play an indispensable role in monitoring and enforcing very important conservation and management measures in the WCPO Indeed observers represent the vanguard of fisheries management through the science and service that they provide Thus observer coverage must be considered a top priority and greater support must be provided to the relevant authority to see that the capacity of the ROP is strengthened First and foremost the WCPFC must take steps to actually implement a consistent and consolidated set of standards for the ROP At this time despite references to an ambiguous Hybrid Model the WCPFC has no identifiable standards or definitions for the ROP33 This leads to variations in interpretation inconsistency in application of existing measures and ultimately contributes to poor quality inconsistent or unreliable data being introduced to the management system Additionally as part of developing the standards the WCPFC must develop clear unambiguous definitions for subjective terms currently used within the operation of the ROP The quality of the data produced by the ROP depends heavily on the quality of the program in place Therefore the WCPFC must take steps to better refine the standards and operating procedures for the ROP Second the WCPFC must ensure through appropriate guidance that national observer programmes administered under the ROP are fully resourced in terms of human and financial capital as well as governed under appropriate administrative and management structures The WCPFC should consider an analysis that considers and presents different funding models that CCMs could consider for ensuring proper administrative and management of the observer program at a national level In any event more attention must be given to the development of minimum standards that ensure a national programme can perform to ROP standards including such efforts as annual reviews of the national programs under preagreed performance standards Third WWF maintains significant concerns regarding the independence of onboard observers from the perspective of data integrity The independence and the security of the observer must be paramount to ensure data integrity Therefore WWF recommends that any observer funding model considered must avoid even the perception of conflict of interest This means establishing a 3rd party payment system that insulates the observer from direct payment by the vessel owner or operator which constitutes an unequivocal financial conflict of interest34 WWF suggests that the WCPFC carefully research funding models that ensure that observer providers can provide timely and secure payments to observers without having those payments made directly to the observer by the vessel owner or operator Specifically WWF believes that a Prepayment Model that would require funding observer placement through an independent 3rd party agent could potentially provide the necessary insulation from undue influence by the vessel owner or operator while also ensuring that the observer is properly paid and transported to their home of record at the conclusion of their service Thus WWF asks the WCPFC to urgently pursue measures to ensure the independence of observers Related to observer independence WWF insists that the WCPFC implement stronger requirements to ensure the health safety and welfare of all observers serving in the WCPFC Very few measures exist to protect observers from bribery threats intimidation or harassment Recent anecdotal and documented information confirms that observers are consistently subject to different forms of harassment that impede their ability to properly do their jobs as well as impact their physical safety and wellbeing while on the vessel When a vessel operator owner fish master crewmember or anyone else interferes with the official duties of an observer they directly obstruct the collection of scientific data that will ultimately decide the sustainable management of their fishery WWF believes that interference with an observer directly results in unreported data subject to sanctions under the UN FAO standards for Illegal Unreported and Unregulated fishing35 Therefore WWF urges not only that the WCPFC put in place discrete provisions to protect observers from interference but also implement an administrative process that protects both the vessel and the observer through a welldefined and transparent administrative review procedure Any violation against an observer that is confirmed through the administrative review should result in the offending vessel being placed on the IUU list WWFPANDAORGSMARTFISHING Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION From a technical perspective WWF previously noted and once again remarks that no current impediment exists for all support vessels to have 100 observer coverage such as the measures currently enforced for purse seine vessels Furthermore WWF advocates that 100 observer coverage be phased in for longline vessels including potential Electronic Monitoring programs to reduce the cost and feasibility of on board observation WWF continues to call for a 3year phase in of 100 ROP coverage for all fishing and support vessels including Year 1 In an effort to effectively enforce transshipment requirements all support vessels resupply refueling reefers for all high seas fishing must have 100 ROP coverage which may include an approved equivalent Electronic Monitoring system36 Year 1 20 of all longline vessels including at least one from each flag state have an ROP observer or approved equivalent Electronic Monitoring system on board Year 2 50 of all longline vessels including more than half of all vessels from each flag state have an ROP observer or approved equivalent Electronic Monitoring system on board and Year 3 100 of all longline vessels have an ROP observer or approved equivalent Electronic Monitoring system on board Other fisheries around the world have demonstrated varying levels of success using EM in limited circumstances depending on the goal of the observation and data collection program Therefore each application of EM is contextual and must be subject to thorough analysis comprehensive testing and careful monitoring to ensure the technology and program is functioning as designed WWF would like to acknowledge the important role that EM could potentially play in ensuring observer coverage throughout the WCPFC CA possibly even at a reduced cost but noting that there will always be a need for human observers to perform certain analytical tasks that a camera sensor or computer simply cannot accomplish The observer program is a critical link to ensure the sustainability of the WCPO tuna fisheries for future generations in the SIDS In some cases nations access to fisheries constitute their only source of revenue and as such must be recognized for its importance to those communities through strong conservation and management measures designed to ensure the long term sustainability of those fisheries In addition to the benefits of improved compliance and enhanced traceability a solid wellfunctioning observer program can help ensure access by member states to important highvalue markets that seek to source from fisheries with,,
transparent measures conducted in accordance with international best practices With respect to the continued implementation and operation of the ROP the WCPFC must Implement a binding consistent and consolidated set of standards for the ROP Conduct a phased implementation of 100 observer coverage on all fishing and support vessels Revise the Observer Provider Code of Conduct to create more substantive requirements on Observer Providers and recipients including the implementation of a schedule of fines and sanctions for noncompliance to be applicable to throughout the WCPFC CA Develop and implement strong set of Minimum Observer Health Safety and Welfare Standards to be applicable to all vessels operating throughout the WCPFC CA Develop and implement a standardized administrative review system to address observer grievances that is empowered to impose sanctions andor penalties on offending vessel owners captains masters andor crew who engage in bribery threats intimidation or harassment of any kind against an observer which would otherwise impede them from conducting their official duties and Implement a Conservation and Management Measure stating that any finding from an administrative review that confirms an instance of bribery threats intimidation or harassment of an observer constitutes an IUU violation resulting in the vessel on which the offense occurred being placed on the IUU list Consider EM in situations deemed appropriate for enforcement and monitoring goals specific to those vessels considered Reconstitute the Data Consultative Committee DCC to address current data issues in the ROP including consideration of o Revisions of data fields for nontarget species to include detailed entries for seabirds turtles and sharks broken out by species in all observer reporting submissions and WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION o Removal of redundant duplicative or otherwise obsolete data fields and Develop a more comprehensive analysis and design plan for spatially and temporally representative observer coverage of each fishery operating in the WCPFC CA IUU Measures WWF would like to commend the WCPFC efforts to address IUU listing procedures under WCPFC CMM 201006 to ensure effectiveness and harmonization with other RFMO procedures The IUU list provides an effective deterrent against vessel owners operators and companies who would otherwise reap the unjustified benefits of a fishery without being subject to the rules by which the rest of the fishery must abide The WCPFC must maintain strong procedures for identifying listing and retaining IUU vessels on IUU Lists to ensure that the integrity of the WCPO fisheries including Ensuring the burden of proof must always remain with the IUU offender to explicitly prove through appropriate documentation WCPFC CMM 201006 paragraph 25 ae that all obligations have been met before being removed from an IUU list Maintaining the current definition of IUU fishing for the purpose of the IUU list and Ensuring that sanctions of adequate severity are always onerous enough to prevent deter and eliminate any future IUU conduct and not just a cost of doing business Data and Statistics One of the most important features of a fully functioning fisheries management regime is the supply of timely and accurate data for use in stock assessments and decision making processes The SC8 noted that several CCMs still have not provided operational catcheffort data and none of these CCMs have submitted a Data Improvement Plan as recommended by WCPFC737 To ensure that all fisheries under the WCPFCs responsibility are sustainably managed the WCPFC must continually seek improvements in data collection and analysis WWF recommends that the WCPFC should Repeat the request for CCMs who have yet to provide operational level catch and effort data provide Data Improvement Plans to the WCPFC and Request that until operational catcheffort data are provided noncompliant CCMs must provide annual catch estimates by gear and species for waters of national jurisdiction and high seas areas separately as per the scientific data provision rules of the WCPFC Miscellaneous Cost Recovery and Optimisation WWF is concerned that the proposal to enact additional costs on nongovernment observers could impose an undue financial hardship on prospective attendees of the WCPFC official meetings At a cost of US500 per meeting for two attendees as well as a US350 per person fee for each additional attendee as proposed in the COST RECOVERY AND THE OPTIMISATION OF COMMISSION SERVICE COSTS Report WCPFCTCC82012IP12 this could effectively make attendance prohibitively expensive for many nongovernment and community service organizations In effect this action would disenfranchise many stakeholders who have direct economic and social interests in the sustainable management of the WCPO fishery resources We wish to note that the report acknowledges that the additional costs imposed by attendance of nongovernment organizations are relatively minor and should not justify an imposition of those fees on less financially capable stakeholders Additionally the WCPFC is not subject to the same level of expense as other RFMOs where such fees are in place to support a high degree of interpretation and translation costs Some observers also provide additional independently funded research and analysis to the WCPFC contributing to new knowledge and understanding of complex issues Furthermore the report also notes that Observers have the opportunity to observe the Commission participate in meetings and to put forward their views while the Commission gains credibility from having transparent processes at its meetings and a chance to receive and respond to observers view This transparency is critical to the commissions operation and credibility By imposing such an undue financial burden on observers the public stakeholders WCPFC only serves to diminish the effectiveness and reputation of the RFMO process and in the end the outcomes that result WWF recommends that the WCPFC must Oppose the implementation of a fee for observers to attend WCPFC meetings WWFPANDAORGSMARTFISHING WWF Statement to the WCPFC 9th Regular Session Manila Philippines 26 December 2012 WWF POSITION 1986 Panda Symbol WWF World Wide

WCPFC9-2012-OP02,2,th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC9 Setting the limits on Western and Central Pacific tuna fisheries Manila Philippines 2nd 6th December 2012
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,3,Introduction This years annual meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC has the important task of putting in place new more effective conservation and management measures CMMs to correct past mistakes and return the tuna fisheries of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPO to sustainability and economic viability for the longterm The failure of parties to this Commission to negotiate and implement an effective replacement CMM for bigeye and yellowfin tuna at its 8th Annual Session in Guam must not be repeated Greenpeace urges that the Commission take into account first and foremost the precautionary approach when deliberating over new conservation and management measures for tuna and other species The future consequences of our failure to act effectively today must not be underestimated
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,4,It is important to note that the current reference points used by the WCPFC for determining the relative health of tuna fisheries the maximum sustainable yield MSY and the corresponding biomass BMSY and fishing rate FMSY should be at best treated as limit reference points to be avoided according to the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries1 and UN Fish Stocks Agreement2 The Commissions science provider SPCOFP notes that given the uncertainties in assessing stock status and natural stock variability practical experience and scientific analysis has shown that treating FMSY as a target often results in depletion of fish stocks and that recovery from overdepletion is difficult The use of MSY as a target is also often suboptimal economically
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,5,Greenpeace calls on WCPFC9 to follow the precautionary approach and adopt the following combination of measures in order to reduce fishing mortality of bigeye by 50 and reduce the threat of overfishing to yellowfin skipjack and albacore tuna including other vulnerable and endangered species in the region Permanent closure of the four high seas pockets to all forms of fishing Total ban on the use of FADs by purse seine fishing vessels Ban all atsea transhipments Ban purse seine sets on whale sharks Immediately halt any increase in effort in the southern albacore fishery until precautionary catch limits are established by the Commission Adopt precautionary limit reference points recommended by SC8 for all target tunas Adopt an unconditional ban on shark finning at sea in the WCPO through a requirement that shark be landed with fins naturally attached
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,6,See Article 753 of FAO 1995 Code of conduct for responsible fisheries Rome Italy Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations Available at wwwfaoorgfiagreemcodecondcodeconasp Anon 1995 Agreement for the implementation of the provisions of The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks Going Going Almost Gone Why Greenpeace is concerned about the state of fishing in the WCPFC Levels of fishing effort and catch for bigeye yellowfin and skipjack tuna over the past few years have been at an alltime high Overfishing of adult bigeye in the longline fishery compounded by the increased catches of juveniles as bycatch in purse seine FAD fishing has drastically reduced the bigeye stock3 Based on the average recruitment in recent years scientists concluded that the bigeye tuna stock is also likely to have dropped below BMSY and the spawning biomass is as low as 23 of its potential spawning level4
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,7,Greenpeace believes that the current 30 reduction in bigeye fishing recommended by the scientific committee is not precautionary as it does not take into account uncertainties attached to the key parameters and assumptions used as inputs for the management models
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,8,Greenpeace calls on the WCPFC to follow the precautionary approach and reduce fishing mortality of bigeye by 50
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,9,For yellowfin tuna the threat of overfishing is extremely high bearing in mind there are significant uncertainties involved in the assessments and in one region of the WCPO where the fishery is concentrated there are already signs of rapid depletion The high mortality rate of juvenile yellowfin primarily due to purse seine FAD fisheries is of particular concern5
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,10,The occurrence of range contraction for skipjack and possibly also for yellowfin tuna6 together with the corresponding decline in catches for some fleets such as the Japanese poleandline fleet is revealing the intensive nature of fishing taking place in the tropical regions Increasing effort for southern albacore by Chinas and Taiwans subsidised distant water fishing fleets is placing pressure on the stock and crowding out a fishery which the smaller domestic longline fleets of the southern Pacific island nations7 are reliant on8
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,11,Beyond tuna oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks are in a dangerously poor state Sharks are both targeted and caught as bycatch in the longline fishery For silky sharks the greatest impact on the stock is attributed to catches from the longline fishery however there are also significant impacts from the FADassociated purse seine fishery where catches are predominantly juvenile silky sharks

WCPFC9-2012-OP02,13,The closure of the four high seas pockets see figure 1 to all forms of fishing would also complement and strengthen initiatives and measures in adjacent Exclusive Economic Zones EEZs in particular recently established marine reserves and protected areas in a number of Pacific Island Countries10 In addition the Parties to the Nauru Agreement PNA have as a condition of its licensing arrangements closed off a large area of international waters including the high seas pockets to purse seine fishing11
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,14,Pacific Island leaders called for the further closure of high seas pocket three Eastern High Seas Pocket see figure 1 Pocket 3 in a bid to tackle overfishing and Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU fishing activities at the Forty Third Pacific Island Leaders Forum held this year in the Cook Islands12 The loss from IUU fishing in the Western and Central Pacific WCPO region has been estimated to be in the vicinity of 2146 of reported catch and is valued at US 07 15 billion13 Greenpeace ship expeditions in 200614 200815 200916 and 201117 repeatedly demonstrated the extensive and pernicious nature of IUU fishing in the region and the role that these high seas areas play in facilitating these illegal activities According to the Eastern High Seas Pocket EHSP Analysis by Cook Islands the EEZs adjacent to the EHSP have experienced several IUU cases over the past ten years18 The pocket is a major entry and exit point for its EEZ and it was being used as a platform for IUU fishing activity being carried out in its waters Data from Vessel Monitoring Systems VMS under CMM 20100219 revealed that many of the vessels operating in the EHSP and other international waters are not reporting to the Commission and these vessels are operating in these waters without being monitored by anybody
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,15,Furthermore increased migration of longline capacity from the Indian Ocean and North Pacific to both tropical tuna fisheries ie bigeye and yellowfin and to the southern albacore fishery is placing additional stress on the stocks and adjacent economies These vessels operating solely on the high Available at httpwwwgreenpeacetopublicationsPacificCBDreportAugust2009pdf Pacific Islands Marine Portal Marine Protected Area Available at httpwwwpimrisportalorgindexphpoptioncomcontentviewarticleid71Itemid65 PNA Amended Third Implementing Arrangement 3IA Forum Communique Paragraph 23 FortyThird Pacific Islands Forum Rarotonga Cook Islands 28 30 August 2012 Available at httpwwwforumsecorgpagescfmdocumentsforumcommuniques MRAG and University of British Columbia 2008 The Global Extent of Illegal Fishing April Available at wwwmragcoukDocumentsExtentGlobalIllegalFishingpdf Available at httpoceansgreenpeaceorgrawcontentendocumentsreportsplunderingpacificpdf Available at httpwwwgreenpeaceorgrawcontentaustraliaresourcesreportsoverfishingdefending ourpacific2008supdf Available at httpwwwgreenpeaceorgrawcontentinternationalpressreportsdefendingour pacific2009summaryreportpdf Available at httpwwwgreenpeaceorginternationalGlobalinternationalpublicationsoceans2012410 DefendingOurPacificpdf EHSP Analysis paper by Cook Island WCPFCTCC82012DP03 27 September 2012 CMM 201002 Conservation and Management Measure for the Eastern High Seas Pocket Special Management Area seas and flagged to Asian fishing powers are poorly regulated highly mobile and have been documented operating in the high seas pockets and in high seas areas adjacent to EEZs In a recently published report it was shown that a closure of the high seas pockets three and four and an additional area of high seas immediately north of Cook Islands EEZ see figure 1 to longline fishing while also banning FADs would have a tremendous conservation benefit on bigeye stocks20
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,16,Domestic longline fleets have indicated their concern over international fleets operating solely on the high seas and using these pockets as platforms to tranship catch out of the region This also underlines the continued need to ban all at sea transhipments Unreported fishing resulting from at sea transhipments causes economic harm to the region as well as undermines the scientific analysis and management effort in the region
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,17,Greenpeace believes that the decision to reopen the pockets at the WCPFC8 was a very shortsighted mistake The opening of the high seas pockets also came with a number of preconditions including the need for better monitoring of fleets and strict implementation of and compliance with monitoring control and surveillance MCS measures The reporting on compliance by flag States at the recent the TCC8 revealed that the preconditions for reopening the closures are not being met
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,18,The benefits of area closures often take several years to detect and need to be complemented with appropriate action to take care of displaced effort Area closures also need to be coupled with other management measures to decrease overfishing and hence any argumentation that the closures are not an effective conservation measure is based on rushed and shortsighted interpretations and influenced by vested interests to maintain high seas freedom and gain short term economic benefits from the areas Moreover it should be noted the Pacific high seas pockets are not ordinary high seas they are high seas enclaves and should as such be treated as special
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,19,Greenpeace is calling on WCPFC9 to close all 4 high seas pockets to all forms of fishing as part of a new measure for skipjack yellowfin and bigeye The closure of the four high seas pockets to all fishing must be made a permanent measure in order to strengthen the benefits derived from existing closures complement initiatives to create a network of marine reserves in adjacent waters and to eradicate IUU fishing
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,20,Unsustainable Tuna Lures Why a ban on Fish Aggregation Devices FADs must be implemented FADs have increased purse seine catches of skipjack and juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tunas and are not a sustainable means of purse seine fishing because of the high catch rate of juvenile tunas and the significant levels of bycatch of other species including vulnerable species of sharks The difference between the composition of a catch between FAD associated and free schooling tuna is dramatic21 Juvenile fish are found in higher numbers in FAD associated sets including juvenile bigeye
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,21,It is clear that banning the use of FADs is an effective conservation measure As illustrated during the temporary FADban months July September total catch was below average during the FAD ban periods Purse seine catch of bigeye tuna was significantly reduced during these closure periods compared to other months of those years when the ban was in effect However total purse seine effort had increased despite the two and three month closures to a record high in 2011 since purse Siberta J Senina I Lehodey P Hampton J 2012 October Shifting from marine reserves to maritime zoning for conservation of Pacific bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Miquel A Delgado de Mol Molina J Ariz R Delgado de Molina1 S Dniz N Daz M Iglesias JC Santana y P Brehmer 2006 Acoustic Selectivity in Tropical Tuna Experimental Purseseine Campaign in the Indian Ocean WCPFCSC22006FT WP8 seine vessels would make up for time lost during the FAD ban months thereby undermining any conservation gains from the closure months It is clear from the preliminary results that FAD bans are effective for the time that they are in effect Given the scientific recommendations for bigeye mortality reductions22 and the recommendations above from the Scientific Committee SC clearly pointing to increasing limitations on FAD use in the purse seine fishery it is clear that the WCPFC urgently needs to extend the FAD ban measure for bigeye as an effective means of reducing the mortality of this species
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,22,The adoption and implementation of a complete yearround ban on the use of FADs in association with purse seine fishing would go a long way to help address excess fishing capacity reduce catches of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna and reduce bycatch of other vulnerable species including oceanic whitetip and silky sharks
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,23,A recently published report revealed that a ban on FADs andor shift of FAD purse seine effort to free schools as well as the removal of longline fishing from known bigeye spawning areas would have a beneficial effect on the bigeye population23
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,24,To have a fighting chance to avoid the severe overfishing and further depletion and future collapse of bigeye tuna Greenpeace is calling on the Commission to implement a full and permanent ban on the use of all FADs in association with purse seine fishing
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,25,Closing the Loopholes for Pirate Fishers Why all atsea transhipments must be banned Evidence from the recent TCC8 continues to show how transhipment at sea plays an integral role in laundering illegally caught fish Fish caught in an area can be transferred to another vessel at sea and not be landed until the catch is far from the vessel that caught it and the fishing grounds in which it was caught This enables vessels to hide illegal catch catch much greater amounts than they report or catch fish in one area and report it as caught in another Under WCPFC current transhipment rules fishing vessels are required to notify the secretariat if transhipping tuna however evidence shows that this is not taking place and that a large number of transhipments are occurring on the high seas in direct contravention of the Commissions rules Transhipment and bunkering at sea are supporting the plunder of the regions tuna stocks Given the inadequate capacity of the Commission VMS system to monitor high seas activities a more effective solution must be put in place Greenpeace calls on all CCMs and CNMs of the WCPFC to ban all atseas transhipments and to alternatively require transhipments in port in order to close the net on IUU fishing in the WCPFC convention area
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,26,Capacity Migration Why effort for southern albacore must be immediately halted Greenpeace notes with concern the increasing number of small to medium scale longliners migrating to the WCPO from the Indian Ocean and Northern Pacific Of particular concern are those vessels operating only on the high seas These vessels place a severe burden on already fragile tuna stocks and contribute very little to the economies of adjacent Pacific coastal states
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,27,Given that they operate only on the high seas have limited vessel monitoring system and observer coverage and are highly mobile and supported by at sea transhipments these vessels are prone to IUU fishing Greenpeace reiterates its concern over the increasing longline capacity and effort SC 2011 Summary Report Seventh Regular Session of the Science Committee WCPFC 917 August 2011 Pohnpei Federated States of Micronesia Available at httpwwwwcpfcintnode3961 see 21 particularly in the southern albacore fishery Poorly regulated fleets operating solely on the high seas are placing increasing and possibly excessive pressure on a fishery that is integral to the fledgling economies of the small island Pacific states that this Commission is obligated to consider in managing the stock High seas longline vessels in the albacore fishery are competing with domestic and locally owned fleets and undermine the development rights of small island coastal State members that are safeguarded by the WCPFC convention Although albacore stocks are seen as healthy stock assessments have consistently cautioned against further increases in catch on the basis that they would reduce vulnerable biomass larger adults and therefore decrease catch rates and profitability Despite these warnings both catch and effort have increased significantly in recent years Stock assessments have shown reductions in spawning biomass
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,28,Given the dependence of coastal states and absence of appropriate data on the stock Greenpeace urges the Commission to immediately halt any further increases in catch and effort for the southern albacore fishery until precautionary limits are established
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,29,Taking the bite out of shark finning Greenpeace fully supports the FFA proposal to amend CMM 201007 to improve the conservation and management of sharks to a complete ban on shark finning at sea through a fins naturally attached approach This approach is recommended internationally as the best practice to improve data gathering and identification of shark catches create a disincentive to targeting and killing sharks for their fins alone and to ensure compliance It is the approach recommended by the Convention on Migratory Species through its MOU on Sharks which is now supported by 50 countries internationally The status and health of these species is currently unknown however it is estimated that shark populations have declined by as much as 70 to 80 percent and that 30 percent of all shark species are threatened or nearthreatened with extinction Greenpeace draws the Commissions attention to recent decisions by several of its Pacific Island members and territories to ban altogether commercial shark finning including possession sale and distribution and to create shark sanctuaries that outlaw unconditionally the targeting of sharks A number of other Pacific Island countries are in the process of creating shark sanctuaries and or strengthening legislation to ban the commercial exploitation of sharks
WCPFC9-2012-OP02,30,Greenpeace is calling on the Commission to place an unconditional ban on commercial shark finning in the WCPO through a requirement that sharks be landed with fins naturally attached in a bid to safeguard the future of one of the oceans oldest known species and to support the efforts of those member countries that have already created shark havens in their waters

WCPFC9-2012-OP03,3,Association for Professional Observers APO Position Paper Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Regional Observer Programme ROP Manila Philippines 26 December 2012
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,4,Introduction
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,5,The Association for Professional Observers APO would like to thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC for the opportunity to address the 9th Regular Session of the WCPFC regarding the role of observers and some of the issues involving the Regional Observer Programme in the Western Central Pacific Ocean WCPO The APO is an international nonprofit nongovernmental organization with the mission to strengthen observer programmes through advocacy and education Our goal is to provide a comprehensive source of information for observers and the public on issues related to fishery observer programmes We also strive to facilitate the exchange of fisheries information while providing an important source of information regarding fisheries observer programme components and use of fisheries observer data It is our intention that the results of our activities may encourage the recruitment and retention of professional observers and foster the best quality observer data for the purposes of conservation and the responsible management of marine living resources
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,6,Globally fisheries observer programmes continue to lack the human capital organizational relational and financial resources needed to ensure adequate data quality objectivity and data integrityi APO emphatically agrees with the recent assessment of the WCPFC that observer programmes cannot operate successfully unless they have good practical administrative support sufficient staff and properly financed programmesii Information collected as part of an appropriate observer programme is critically important to the proper management of a fishery
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,7,Observers play an indispensable role in monitoring and enforcing very important aspects of the WCPO tuna fisheries The APO is pleased to see the current interest in development and expansion of the existing Regional Observer Programme ROP but sees certain areas that could be substantially improved Thus observer coverage must be considered a priority at the WCPFC and greater support must be provided to ensure that the capacity of the ROP is strengthened As the largest observer programme with more than 600 observers the WCPFC ROP must be persistent and vigilant at maintaining developing and enhancing its observer programme in order to ensure a high degree of integrity and reliability necessary for a fully functional fisheries management system
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,8,APO possesses extensive knowledge and background in some of the most technically sophisticated observer programmes as well as some of the smaller less sophisticated programmes around the world We very much look forward to engaging with the WCPFC to assist in improving the ROP in the future
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,9,APO would like to address 3 major issues of concern regarding the ROP at this meeting Improvements in Observer Health Safety and Welfare Fostering and Developing Observer Professionalism and The Appropriate Approach and Use of Electronic Monitoring EM Discussion Health Safety and Welfare
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,10,First and foremost the APO remains very concerned regarding continued reports of threats intimidation harassment and bribery of observers serving on vessels operating in the WCPFC Convention Area CAiii Observers must be allowed to collect unbiased scientific data aboard commercial fishing vessels free from any kind of harassment interference and bribery We are further disturbed by recent reports that have confirmed that some vessels legally allowed to fish in the WCPFC CA have engaged in human rights abuses toward crew employed on board those vesselsiv Additional documentedv and anecdotal reports also cite instances that could represent human rights abuses toward crew and potentially observers Most ominously as recently as 2010 an observer serving in the WCPFC CA was tragically lost at sea in a suspected murder for which his activity as an observer allegedly provided the motivevi To our best knowledge the alleged perpetrators of this heinous crime were acquitted of all charges and released resulting in a chilling effect on any other observers seeking to do their jobs These represent serious threats to the health safety and welfare of observers that must be met with the greatest sense of urgency
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,11,APO acknowledges that the WCPFC has attempted to address some observer health safety and welfare issues such as through an effort to maintain minimum safety standards under the Vessel Safety Checklistvii and Certificate and Secretariat of the Pacific Community Offshore Fisheries Programme SPCOFP Safety at Sea programmesviii While we view this as a positive step we understand that despite these measures the WCPFC continues to receive complaints from observers regarding the lack of appropriate safety equipment on board vesselsix More attention must also be given to the general welfare of observers on board vessels beyond just their basic safety It is imperative that observers are not only provided with the best tools for doing their jobs but are also provided an environment where they are capable of performing their official duties safely and free from interference To facilitate the collection of secure accurate and reliable data from the fisheries observers must have and be well informed of wellestablished rights and protections
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,12,The APO also joins the World Wide Fund for Nature WWF in support of stronger procedural measures to ensure the protection of observers working in the WCPO When a vessel operator owner fish master crewmember or anyone else interferes with the official duties of an observer they directly obstruct the collection of scientific data that will ultimately decide the sustainable management of their fishery APO agrees with WWF that interference with an observer directly results in unreported data subject to sanctions under the UN FAO standards for Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU fishingx Therefore the APO joins WWF in urging not only that the WCPFC put in place discrete provisions to protect observers from interference but also implement a welldefined and transparent administrative review procedure that ensures protection through an administrative process Lastly the APO also believes that any violation against an observer that is confirmed through the proposed administrative review should result in the offending vessel being placed on the IUU listxi
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,13,Therefore the APO strongly recommends establishing the following measures to address the serious concerns regarding observer health safety and welfare Develop and Implement an Observer Bill of Rights to be approved and agreed by the WCPFC and applicable to all observer programmes throughout the WCPFC CAxii Revise Agreed Minimum Standards to the Regional Observer Programmes to include roles and responsibilities of the Observer Provider to ensure the adherence of their observer employees to the Observer Code of Conduct and ensure the safety and welfare of the observer This should include Observer Provider responsibility for ensuring travel and transportation arrangements to and from the vessel accommodations and food allowances on and off the vessel medical and life insurance both on the vessel and in transit and efficient treatment of any illness or injury Observer Provider performance standards should be reviewed regularly and an implementation of a schedule of fines andor sanctions for noncompliance be applicable throughout the WCPFC Develop and implement a strong set of Minimum Observer Health Safety and Welfare Standards to be applicable to all vessels operating throughout the WCPFC CA Develop guidelines training and certification for captains and crew on WCPFC Conservation and Management Measures CMMs to ensure compliance with those measures Develop and implement a blacklist of captains or crew with a history of noncompliance especially regarding issues of observer harassment interference and assault Develop and implement a standardized administrative review system to address observer grievances that is empowered to impose sanctions andor penalties on offending vessel owners captains masters andor crew who engage in bribery threats intimidation harassment or assault of any kind against an observer which would otherwise impede them from conducting their official duties and Implement a CMM stating that any finding from an administrative review that confirms an instance of bribery threats intimidation harassment or assault of an observer constitutes an IUU violation resulting in the vessel on which the offense occurred being placed on the IUU list Observer Professionalism
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,14,The APO continues to focus on Observer Professionalism issues through its projects actions and outputs in an effort to work towards ensuring the professional and equitable employment of observers The APO would like to point out that many of the most successful fisheries professionals around the world got their start as observers which offered them unparalleled experience in the fishing industry as well as biological research Therefore the APO strongly feels that Observer Professionalism should be fostered in part to help ensure a bright future for fisheries science and management The APO believes that support for Observer Professionalism can involve many different aspects of observer employment including but not limited to
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,15,Trainings Skills maintenance Accessibility of resources and gear Fairness of the standards and the delivery of employment Emergency action planning Enforcement strength and reliability Avenues for feedbackevaluation delivery and reception Professional advancement opportunities and Any policy directives or actions that may affect the professional livelihood of an observer We encourage the further development of the observer training programmes in the WCPFC CA with an additional emphasis on professional development As part of the observer certification and training process the APO recommends that the WCPFC advance the following themes in the training programmes under its authority
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,16,Observers are professionally supported regarding social discrimination or inequity ie gender race ethnicity class during all stages of selection training and employment Observers are professionally supported to be placed at the location of their work ie on a vessel in an unbiased manner Observers are remunerated in such a way as to not be financially dependent upon the vessels or fishing industry they are tasked to monitor which creates a clear conflict of interest Observers are professionally supported against all conflicts of interest which may have an effect on how they perform their job Observers are professionally supported to receive a competitive wage and benefit package ie insurance separate from the vessels comparable to equivalent professions with similar workloads risks and responsibilities from within particular geographic regions of work Observers are professionally supported during work contract negotiations Observers qualified and in good standing are professionally supported to be retrained in the profession as their experience increases and Observers are professionally supported to advance among their field The APO fully understands and appreciates the variations among the numerous national observer programmes in the WCPO For instance the issue of observer pay among states with different currencies and standards of living is complicated worldwide but it is not irresolvable and the WCPFC should seek existing and innovative solutions to those issues Under any circumstance the WCPFC bears an obligation to ensure that all observers are treated fairly and equitably in their service reflecting the professional nature of their service and the importance of their role
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,17,Therefore the APO strongly recommends the WCPFC Develop and distribute a suite of welldefined Observer Professionalism Standards based on the themes and principles promoted by the APO to be implemented among all national observer programmes in the WCPFC CA
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,18,Electronic Monitoring EM
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,19,The APO is dedicated to the interests of human observers However APO does recognize that EM can be used effectively under certain circumstances depending on the goal of the observation and data collection programme However each application of EM must require a wellstructured and analyzed design comprehensive testing and careful monitoring to ensure the technology is functioning as intended It is also critical that resulting reports be regularly published in a transparent way Even after over a decade of EM implementation in several fisheries many questions and concerns regarding the technology remain unresolved or poorly analyzed including
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,20,What observer duties may be sacrificed or compromised by the implementation of EM as opposed to a human observer How will issues of species identification be accounted for EM is still typically poor at distinguishing species How is data integrity maintained to ensure proper analysis and protections against unlawful tampering and what are the consequences for technical failures How will the EM information be transferred to usable data How is data shared and stored such that it ensures security while also offering access to stakeholders and transparency in the data used for fishery management decisions There are some things that EM simply cannot do which require human observers such as otolithscaletooth sampling length measurements species identification tissueDNA sampling fish tagging tag recovery sightings of suspected IUU boats marine mammalsea bird abundance and environmental compliance monitoring Furthermore a camera cannot inform a captain or vessel master that an activity or proposed activity might result in them violating a law leaving the camera to simply document the violation rather than potentially prevent the violation in the first place EM can effectively supplement human observers in limited applications but there will always be a need for human observers to perform their important scientific role in the collection of quality biological and fisheries data Observer data and biological specimen collection generates a solid knowledge basis to enable member states to undertake conservation management and sustainable development of fisheries
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,21,Thus regarding Electronic Monitoring the APO recommends the WCPFC Carefully consider the implementation of EM in the fisheries within its jurisdiction and Conduct a comprehensive and transparent analysis of any proposed EM programme ensuring that the purpose and need is clearly stated the design is sound and the targeted goal is consistent with the data needs conducive to proper conservation and management of the fishery Conclusion
WCPFC9-2012-OP03,22,The APO would like to thank the WCPFC once again for the opportunity to address the WCPFC regarding the very important issues involving fisheries observers As the vanguard of fisheries management through the science and service that they provide observers must be provided the tools environment and treatment they deserve to ensure sustainable fisheries for our world We would very much like to continue a dialogue with the WCPFC Secretariat SPC Forum Fisheries Agency and any Members Cooperating NonMembers and Participating Territories of the WCPFC interested in improving their Observer Programmes Please feel free to contact us

WCPFC9-2012-OP04,7,Dear Sir or Madam
WCPFC9-2012-OP04,8,I am writing on behalf of the Pew Environment Group in regards to the discussions that will take place at the upcoming 9th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC in Manila Philippines
WCPFC9-2012-OP04,9,The WCPFC has a unique and important responsibility as custodian of the worlds largest tuna fishery in an area covering 20 percent of the Earths surface This responsibility requires strong conservation and management actions through joint commitments and compliance Unfortunately Commission Members Cooperating Nonmembers and Participating Territories CCMs collectively have failed to take sufficient actions in recent meetings
WCPFC9-2012-OP04,10,At the 8th Regular Session of the WCPFC WCPFC 8 in Guam earlier this year CCMs were unable to reach consensus on more than a one year conservation measure for the tropical tuna fishery National positions and interests took precedence over making difficult yet critical management decisions and the stewardship of the worlds most valuable tuna fishery took a step back Further even with a mandate to protect sharks and clear scientific evidence of the need for action for several species CCMs took meaningful action on only one shark species
WCPFC9-2012-OP04,11,All WCPFC CCMs must be willing to compromise from their current positions to ensure that this does not happen again and that clear multiyear action is taken at WCPFC 9 in December This years meeting is critical for the future of bigeye and Pacific bluefin tuna and many shark species in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean

stocks in the western and central Pacific Ocean WCPO The Commission is also the Regional Fisheries Management Organization RFMO with the clearest mandate to protect sharks These responsibilities require strong conservation and management actions through joint commitments and compliance Unfortunately the Commissions Members Cooperating Nonmembers and Participating Territories CCMs collectively

of bigEyE TuNA Although all CCMs play a critical role in ensuring the overall health of fisheries and the broader ecosystem there has been a clear lack of leadership in the WCPO on the issue of bigeye tuna conservation The longline fishery for this species is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and is closely linked with other ecosystem conservation considerations such as catches of turtles sharks and seabirds Overfishing of bigeye tuna continues and only a multipronged management measure can address the problem effectively To date WCPFC members have adopted actions such as fish aggregating device FAD closures and longline reductions that help decrease bigeye mortality In recent discussions at the 9th Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee TCC9 earlier this year many governments took the view that they have made a sufficient contribution and that further action must come from somewhere else However according to the Scientific Committee measures that reduce fishing mortality across a range of fish sizes eg fishing gear are likely to produce the best results1 This means that all WCPFC members must do more to reduce mortality if a new CMM is to end overfishing Given that the vast majority of bigeye tuna fishing mortality comes from purse seiners using FADs and from longline fisheries any new measure must focus on further reducing mortality from both of these gears Effective management can be achieved only by joint action based on strong scientific advice and a commitment to compliance 1 cATch fEWER juvENilE bigEyE by liMiTiNg fAd uSE To 2010 lEvElS FAD closures have been effective in reducing bigeye tuna catch during the closure period but unrestricted FAD use in the nonclosure period resulted in a record number of FAD sets in 20112 The th Session of the Scientific Committee SC8 recommended limiting FAD sets to 2010 levels to end overfishing of bigeye In practical terms this means capping the number of FAD sets in a given year to about 15000 according to the Secretariat of the Pacific Community SPC Certain CCMs such as Japan have already taken steps to reduce their numbers of FAD sets and it is time for other CCMs to follow Japans example and for the Commission to adopt a firm limit2 cATch fEWER AdulT bigEyE ANd MoRE AccuRATEly REPoRT loNgliNE cATch Until fewer bigeye tuna are caught and until misreporting in the longline fishery is addressed CMMs will continue to fall short of their objectives scientists will have incomplete and inaccurate data for stock assessments and potential benefits from maintaining sustainable stocks in the region will be undermined Longline vessels have the most to gain from bigeye conservation and stand to lose the most if bigeye populations decrease further SC8 recommends reductions in fishing mortality across all gears including longlines to end overfishing of bigeye A continuation of the advice in 200801 would achieve the required mortality reduction but misreporting of target catch remains a widespread compliance issue in the region and continues to undermine CMMs3 I 6 POLICY STATEMENT To fully address these problems 100 percent of the longline fishing activity in WCPFC fisheries should be observed However we recognize that 100 percent observer coverage is unrealistic in the near term Given the high impact that largescale freezer longliners have on target associated and dependent species the WCPFC should mandate 100 percent observer coverage on these vessels Pew also recommends that the WCPFC increase coverage levels on all other longliners to at least 20 percent in accordance with the best available scientific advice4 The WCPFC should also investigate the potential for use of electronic observer systems as an alternative to human observers Bigeye

broader ecosystem there has been a clear lack of leadership on the issue of bigeye conservation The bigeye tuna longline fishery is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and is closely linked with other ecosystem conservation issues such as catches of turtles sharks and seabirds According to Article 30 of its Convention the WCPFC must implement measures to ensure that a disproportionate burden of conservation action is not placed on developing States Parties and territories and possessions In short the WCPFC CCMs that benefit the most from bigeye fishing should lead conservation efforts However many of those CCMs have argued that further cuts by their longliners would be an unfair hardship According to economic statistics however the value of the catch from the top five bigeyecatching CCMs has increased by more than 17 percent since 2008 when the previous measure was adopted compared with a cumulative 38 percent decline in value for all other CCMs and cooperating non members CNM Within the WCPFC five CCMs gain most of the benefits from the bigeye longline fishery They receive 84 percent of the value or benefit from bigeye fishing These CCMs also have significant purse seine fleets that fish on FADs These CCMs should lead holistic conservation initiatives that limit FAD use and reduce longline effort in line with the spirit of the WCPFC and the letter of its treaty Table 1 ccMs that benefit the most from bigeye tuna in longline and purse seine fisheries ccMs that benefit the most from bigeye tuna value of longline bigeye landed in in millions of uSd value

deter illegal unregulated and unreported IUU activity in those areas which are complementary to inzone measures are implemented effectively Opening the pockets without those measures would weaken monitoring control and surveillance MCS and increase the regions vulnerability to IUU activities The closures should also be expanded to cover longline fisheries until strengthened transshipment measures are fully implemented 4 iMPlEMENT A coMPliANcE REgiME WiTh cMMS Noncompliance with CMMs threatens fish populations and associated and dependent species as well as the very credibility of the WCPFC It also undermines the activities of those who play by the rules To ensure that CCMs are fully accountable for their fishing activities the WCPFC should agree to implement a comprehensive and transparent compliance regime that systematically reviews fishing activities and automatically imposes appropriate penalties on CCMs that violate conservation and management measures This process should be open and transparent to all WCPFC observers so that civil society can learn how all parties are carrying out their stewardship responsibilities for the Pacifics highly migratory species iMPlEMENT cATch liMiTS ANd iMPRovE MoNiToRiNg ANd TRANSPARENcy WCPFC CCMs have an opportunity this year to strengthen management across multiple fisheries by committing to critical articles of the WCPF Convention notably Article 5 on the principles and measures for conservation and management Article 6 on the application of the precautionary approach and Article 21 on transparency Specifically this can be accomplished by managing and monitoring the use of FADs setting target and limit reference points for tuna fisheries and improving transparency in management of fisheries in the North Pacific especially for Pacific bluefin tuna1 iMPRovE fAd MANAgEMENT CCM compliance with FAD management requirements has been extremely poor as noted in WCPFCTCC72011OB016 and the uncontrolled proliferation of FADs must be addressed as a matter of priority In addition to limiting FAD sets CCMs fishing with FADs should be required to submit management plans and information on FAD numbers deployed recovered lost so that the Scientific Committee has better information on extent of use potential ecosystem impacts associated with the uncontrolled proliferation and marine debris data Moreover the use of FADs may give fishing operators access to fishing areas beyond their license including EEZs where they are not authorized to fish In this context FADs could enable a form of IUU fishing and it is therefore critical to develop MCS tools to regulate and control them FAD management requirements should be clearly stipulated in line with the recent International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN resolution 31 WCC2012Res031EN on tuna management The motion urged RFMOs and IUCN State and government agency Members with vessels fishing on drifting FADs to take the following actions on FAD management I 9 POLICY STATEMENT a Develop and submit to their respective RFMOs FAD management plans that are standard across fleets and regions so that RFMO scientific committees have better information on the extent of their use potential ecosystem impacts associated with the uncontrolled proliferation of drifting FADs and marine debris information b Undertake

Article 6 of the WCPFC Convention states In applying the precautionary approach the members of the Commission shall a apply the guidelines set out in Annex II of the Agreementand determine on the basis of the best scientific information available stockspecific reference points and the action to be taken if they are exceeded The 2012 Management Objectives Workshop was a first step to implementing this critical requirement WCPFC CCMs should adopt interim target and limit reference points building off the outcomes of the Management Objectives Workshop various papers presented at SC8 and Working Paper WCPFCTCC7201101 Further discussion on reference points and harvest control rules should continue to ensure that limit reference points have a low chance of being exceeded and that targets achieve the desired outcomes 21 Implement sciencebased catch limits for Pacific bluefin tuna The Pacific bluefin tuna fishery is now the worlds largest with the majority of the catch taken in WCPFC waters However management has not kept up with the growth of the fishery overfishing is occurring and preliminary results from the 2012 assessment indicate the continued decline of the species7 The Northern Committee should convene in Manila to review the results of the latest stock assessment and adopt sciencebased catch limits for implementation in 2013 This is a critical starting point for the process of setting target and limit reference points for Pacific bluefin The WCPFC should also implement measures to reduce juvenile catch as recommended by the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC by adopting a minimum size of 30 kg with a 40 percent tolerance for undersized fish Pacific Bluefin Richard Hermann I 103 iNcREASE ThE TRANSPARENcy of ThE iSc SciENTific PRocESS The WCPFC relies on the ISC to provide scientific stock assessments for the species managed by the Northern Committee including Pacific bluefin tuna This year however the ISC failed to complete the bluefin assessment in a timely manner leaving the Northern Committee without the critical scientific information needed to recommend effective catch limits and complementary management measures The ISC also lacks transparency in its process refusing to admit nongovernmental observers to meetings and declining to share its assessment reports Its failure to release its stock assessment documents and reports also poses problems for the Scientific Committee as was the case with the North Pacific striped marlin assessment this year These actions are not consistent with the high standards under which the WCPFC operates It should consider other more transparent arrangements such as working with the SPC to assess northern stocks going forward AdoPT coNSERvATioN ANd MANAgEMENT MEASuRES To PRoTEcT ShARkS Sharks are among the oceans most vulnerable animals According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 143 shark species are threatened or near threatened with extinction Even though the WCPFC is the most modern of the tuna RFMOs and has the clearest mandate to protect species within its jurisdiction it has taken meaningful action on only one shark species The WCPFC must act to ensure that targeted fishing and bycatch do not deplete shark populations and drive them to extinction1 PRohibiT ThE RETENTioN of Silky ANd hAMMERhEAd ShARkS The 2012 stock assessments for silky sharks Carcharhinus falciformis show that they are overfished and that overfishing is occurring in the WCPO8 9 Although the Scientific Committee determined that management advice could not be provided because of concerns about data and biases in the assessment it did note that some basic fisheries indicators are showing declines in recent years It also recommended mitigation measures to reduce the impact of nontarget fisheries on this species10 Because the best available science shows that silky sharks are overfished and that overfishing is occurring retention of silky sharks should be prohibited while efforts are made to improve the stock assessment Scalloped Sphyrna lewini smooth Sphyrna zygaena and great Sphyrna mokarran hammerhead sharks are species of significant global concern and have recently been proposed for inclusion on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES These species of hammerheads along with the winghead shark Eusphyra blochii are among the 13 Key Shark Species identified by the WCPFC Unfortunately no resources are assigned to these species under the Shark Research Plan SRP and no assessments are planned Although little is known about the status of hammerhead populations in the WCPO an assessment off the east coast of Australia found that catch rates of hammerheads have decreased by more than 85 percent over 44 years11 Because of significant concerns about the status of hammerhead populations and because no scientific assessment or advice is expected in the near future the WCPFC should prohibit the retaining on board transshipping storing and landing of hammerhead sharks POLICY STATEMENT I 11 POLICY STATEMENT2 PRohibiT PuRSE SEiNE vESSElS fRoM iNTENTioNAlly SETTiNg NETS ARouNd WhAlE ShARkS The practice of setting purse seines on whale sharks Rhincodon typus in the WCPO is a significant concern The observed interaction and mortality rates imply that total whale shark mortalities in the purse seine fishery were approximately 56 animals in 2009 and 19 animals in 201012 Mortality occurs in approximately one in every 10 sets involving a whale shark interaction13 To protect these slowmoving vulnerable sharks the WCPFC should prohibit purse seine vessels from intentionally setting nets around whale sharks in the convention area Further because whale sharks rarely escape unassisted before the net is closed vessel operators must be required to safely release entangled whale sharks The Pew Environment Group supports the SC8 recommendation that the whale shark be defined as a Key Shark Species of the WCPFC Although this designation and an eventual stock assessment would be a useful endeavor immediate action is needed to reduce whale shark mortality and we urge the WCPFC to prohibit the intentional setting of purse seine nets on whale sharks Whale shark Olivier RouxMarine Photobank I 123 MANdATE ThE uSE of ShARk bycATch MiTigATioN METhodS Shark bycatch in WCPFC fisheries is detrimental to the survival of many populations of these animals Their life history characteristics make them extremely susceptible to fishing pressure and the recovery potential for depleted shark species is significantly lower than that of other fish species Bycatch of oceanic whitetip Carcharhinus longimanus and silky sharks is of special concern considering the recent assessments showing that the populations are overfished and that overfishing is occurring The status of blue sharks is also a matter of concern Pew supports SC8s recommendation that bycatch mitigation measures be put in place Many longline vessels use wire leaders also known as steel traces to secure their catch on lines Shark bycatch is higher on longlines that use wire leaders because sharks are unable to break through the wire to escape Thus the use of wire leaders creates a de facto targeted but unregulated shark fishery Prohibiting wire leaders is a clear solution for reducing shark bycatch in longline fisheries In addition the use of monofilament can actually increase the catch of some target species such as tuna and swordfish14 15 For example research undertaken off the northeast Australian coast showed that monofilament leaders catch more target species with a statistically increased catch of bigeye tuna thereby increasing earnings per trip while wire leaders catch more sharks The study showed a clear financial incentive for fishers to use nylon leaders The longliners deploying only nylon leaders made approximately US8000 more per year than did longliners fishing with wire leaders16 Sharks that are brought next to the vessel alive when the fishing gear is retrieved can easily be freed with the use of line cutters Thus a prohibition on wire leaders would also facilitate compliance with the WCPFCs CMM 201007 paragraph 10 which says that CCMs shall take measures to encourage the release of live sharks that are caught incidentally and are not used for food or other purposes Gear modifications such as the use of single monofilament nylon leaders should be mandated so that fewer sharks are caught as bycatch in WCPFC tuna fisheries 4 PRohibiT ThE REMovAl of ShARk fiNS AT SEA To iMPRovE ENfoRcEMENT of ThE ShARk fiNNiNg bAN The WCPFCs ban on shark finningthe

for Pacific oceanic fisheries concluded that the majority of IUU activity in the region is associated with licensed vessels The project identified inadequate reporting as an area of concern and underlined the need to strengthen catch monitoring and validation throughout the supply chain17 In this context port State measures PSMs have proved to be effective at preventing the entry of illegal fish into the market and in removing the economic incentive for IUU fishing operators to continue with their activities The United Nations General Assembly has urged States to ratify the Food and Agriculture Organizations Port State Measures Agreement PSMA of 2009 cooperate through RFMOs and adopt all necessary port State measures18 In addition States at Rio20 agreed to expedite national processes to ratify the PSMA and implement measures that identify vessels engaged in IUU fishing19 The WCPFCs Performance Review Report recommended that in considering Port State Measures the Commission should take into account minimum standards in the PSMA measures and practices of other RFMOs in implementing such standards and developments in the broader system of Port controls20 Analysis conducted by the Pew Environment Group comparing the PSMs in the WCPFC with those established by the PSMA revealed a number of gaps in the WCPFCs PSMs such as no comprehensive inspection scheme no requirement for vessels to provide information before entering ports and no prohibition of port entry to IUU vessels21 The Pew Environment Group is aware that a number of WCPFC CCMs will need time to fully implement the provisions of the PSMA However the WCPFC should initiate constructive action toward the development of stronger control measures by gradually adopting enhanced PSMs In this context the European Unions proposal discussed at TCC8 for a CMM to establish a WCPFC scheme for minimum standards for inspection in port offers a good basis for progress that would complement the MCS minimum standards already applicable in the region In addition the proposal recognizes the needs and requirements of Small Island developing states and territories Providing support to developing States to effectively implement PSMs will be crucial to the effectiveness of a new regional port inspection scheme Any efforts in this direction should take into account existing initiatives in the region such as the ACP Fish II Programme23 POLICY STATEMENT Micronesia Adam Baske Pew I 142 REquiRE iMo NuMbERS foR vESSElS of 100 gRoSS ToNNES oR MoRE oR 24 METERS oR gREATER

WCPFC9-2012-OP06,1,COMMISSION NINTH REGULAR SESSION Manila Philippines 6 December 2012 ISSF POSITION STATEMENT WCPFC92012OP6 December2012
WCPFC9-2012-OP06,2,ISSF POSITION STATEMENT Presented during the 9th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission in Manila Philippines 7 December 2012 The International Seafood Sustainability Foundation ISSF is a global partnership among the tuna industry science and WWF the global conservation organization Our mission is to work toward the sciencebased conservation and management of tuna stocks and the protection of ocean health by supporting regional fisheries management organizations and advocating for the recommendations of each organizations scientific advisory body The first part of our statement addresses three of the most important issues facing global tuna sustainability reference points and harvest control rules fleet capacity and the management of FADs The second part addresses challenges specific to the WCPFC GLOBAL ISSUES Harvest Control Rules HCRs and Reference Points HCRs are a set of welldefined management actions to be taken in response to changes in stock status with respect to target and limit reference points Unless there is a preagreed upon action plan for avoiding overfishing or for rebuilding an overfished stock long negotiations lead to delayed action or inaction This delay can lead to further damage to the stock requiring even more aggressive curtailing of fishing The adoption of HCRs is a key aspect of modern fisheries management and is also a requirement of several ecolabel certification programs ISSF endorses the application of the Precautionary Approach using clear target and limit reference points and HCRs as called for by the UN Fish Stocks Agreement and by some RFMO Conventions While most tuna RFMOs have at least begun consideration of limit reference points through their science committees none have fully implemented these measures ISSF urges all tuna RFMOs to adopt stockspecific limit and target reference points and HCRs This is one of the most important actions that RFMO members can take to ensure the longterm sustainability of tuna stocks Though seven years have passed since the Convention entered into force the WCPFC has yet to adopt any reference points in accordance with Article 6 ISSF supports the adoption of the stockspecific limit reference points recommended by SC8 and looks forward to substantial progress on target reference points and HCRs at the upcoming Management Objectives Workshop ISSF urges CCMs to give this matter the highest priority at WCPFC9 Closed Vessel Registries and Management of Fleet Capacity Experts agree that there is overcapacity in the global tuna fleets Fishing fleet overcapacity increases pressure to weaken management measures and eventually leads to stock overexploitation The first step towards managing capacity is to establish limited entry via a comprehensive closed vessel registry with an eye towards ultimately reducing the number of fishing vessels to an appropriate level The IATTC is the only tuna RFMO with a closed vessel registry although current capacity is well in excess of resource productivity
WCPFC9-2012-OP06,3,ISSF supports the Kobe III call for a freeze in purse seine fishing capacity by developed fishing nations and creating mechanisms to transfer capacity to developing countries with aspirations to participate in these fisheries These steps should be taken now since scaling back fleet capacity will become even more difficult as new vessels are introduced To this end ISSF urges the following actions ICCAT IOTC and WCPFC adopt closed vessel registries especially for purse seine fleets All tuna RFMOs develop capacity transfer mechanisms to allow for increased participation by developing countries without an increase in overall capacity while ensuring effective monitoring and control of the fisheries All tuna RFMOs establish rules for monitoring and managing the movement of fishing capacity among the respective Convention Areas All tuna RFMOs require unique vessel identifiers such as IMO numbers in order to strengthen their ability to monitor fishing capacity globally through the Consolidated List of Authorized Vessels CLAV Fish Aggregating Device FAD Management Setting on FADs accounts for nearly 40 of global tuna catches and 50 of global skipjack catches The time is ripe for a concerted global effort to gather and report to RFMOs data on FADs eg via logbooks in order to better monitor FAD usage and to establish a sound basis for their management in every ocean region With this information scientists can advise decisionmakers on how to reduce catches of small tunas and bycatch of nontarget species that are commonly associated with FADs Providing science bodies with detailed data on FADs and other floating objects can also greatly improve their stock assessments However with the exception of data collected through observer programs there remains a need and opportunity to improve the information about this type of fishing at the RFMO level In addition there is a growing understanding of best practices in FAD construction and bycatch mitigation developments that ISSF is actively promoting that could be implemented in the short term As noted in CMM 200801s FAD Management Plan guidelines Appendix E and TCC5 200922 in order to adequately monitor FADs there are two primary types of information that need to be collected and reported to RFMO scientific bodies i an inventory and activity record of FADs FAD logbook FAD markings construction specifications deployment retrievals etc and ii a record of encounters of fishing and supply vessels with the FADs fishing logbook catch by species that results from sets made on FADs These two types of information should be linked through the FAD ID or marking Using this data RFMO scientific bodies can and should advise on any necessary FAD management measures followed by the development of effective mechanisms for implementation and compliance monitoring by fishery managers WCPFC CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES CMM 200801 and the Purse Seine Fishery The analyses presented at SC8 corroborate the fact that CMM 200801 has been ineffective in meeting the objectives of controlling purse seine effort and ending the overfishing of the bigeye stock The number of purse seine fishing days continues to increase and the catch of bigeye and the number of FAD sets in 2011 were the highest on record The results of projections presented at SC7 and SC8 suggest that a total seasonal closure of the purse seine fishery as compared to a FAD closure would have only a marginal conservation gain for bigeye whereas there would be a loss in total yield ISSF notes however that these analyses did not consider uncertainty in the implementation of either type of closure ISSF is convinced that a total closure of the
WCPFC9-2012-OP06,4,purse seine fisheries eg for two or three months at a time of the year when the catch rates of bigeye are high without exemptions would be much easier to implement monitor and enforce ISSF supports conservation measures as recommended by the WCPFCs science provider and committee whether FAD closures or limits or total closures provided that the selected measures are both fully enforceable and applicable to all participants Other analyses presented at SC8 suggest that additional management measures such as limiting the number of FAD sets made each year could be used to address the problem of bigeye overfishing ISSF would support a limit on the number of FAD sets as long as it can be properly monitored and enforced throughout the Convention Area This measure and similar ones such as individual vessel bigeye limits has obvious allocation implications and deserves thoughtful negotiation among the parties to ensure consistent implementation In addition monitoring the accumulation of FAD sets per vessel in real time could subject observers to undue pressure from fishers The analyses reviewed by SC7 and SC8 indicate that the exemptions in CMM 200801 account for about onehalf of the overfishing of bigeye tuna ISSF urges WCPFC9 to eliminate these exemptions and to improve bigeye data through more comprehensive reporting of catches by Indonesian and Philippine fleets including catches from all waters and made by all vessels under their jurisdictions Sharks SC8 concluded that the stock of oceanic whitetip shark is overfished and that substantial overfishing is taking place recent fishing mortality is 65 times higher than FMSY The analyses for silky sharks were inconclusive but SC8 recommended that fishing mortality not be allowed to increase Since the major source of mortality for both of these stocks is from nontarget fisheries SC8 concluded that bycatch mitigation measures are the best tool for addressing the conservation of these two vulnerable species To augment WCPFC8s decision regarding the prohibition on oceanic whitetips ISSF urges CCMs to consider more robust bycatch mitigation measures improved data collection and reporting and the development of stockspecific reference points ISSF urges the Commission to take further steps to enforce the existing conservation and management measure addressing shark finning and move to the total prohibition of the atsea removal of shark fins and mandate that fins remain naturally attached for all sharks landed ISSF is also asking all RFMOs including the WCPFC to adopt a prohibition on deliberate purse seine setting around whale sharks As this prohibition is already a requirement for those vessels fishing in PNA waters expanding the measure to other waters in the Convention Area is a natural next step It was understood at WCPFC8 that a finalized measure would be approved at WCPFC9 and ISSF looks forward to its adoption Longlining ISSF notes with concern the continuing increase in the number of longline vessels operating in the WCPFC Convention Area the low levels of observer coverage continuing transshipments at sea and activity in the High Seas beyond coastal State control ISSF urges WCPFC9 to impose and enforce as a precautionary measure measures to limit longliner capacity in the Convention Area ISSF further urges the Commission to task its scientific body to make recommendations to WCPFC10 regarding the levels of longline capacity consistent with sustainable exploitation and prudent management of target tuna stocks For further information please visit httpwwwISSFOUNDATIONorg
WCPFC9-2012-OP09,1,COMMISSION NINTH REGULAR SESSION Manila Philippines 6 December 2012 AMERICAN FISHERMANS RESEARCH FOUNDATION STATEMENT ON SOUTH PACIFIC ALBACORE TROLL FISHERY AND US HISTORIC INVOLVEMENT WCPFC92012OP09 December 2012 hrs
WCPFC9-2012-OP09,2,AMERICAN FISHERMENS RESEARCH FOUNDATION STATEMENT ON SOUTH PACIFIC ALBACORE TROLL FISHERY AND US HISTORIC INVOLVEMENT
WCPFC9-2012-OP09,3,Western Fishboat Owners Association WFOA along with American Fishermens Research Foundation AFRF were instrumental in researching the feasibility of a small vessel troll albacore fishery in the South Pacific
WCPFC9-2012-OP09,4,Through two contracts with the Pacific Fisheries Development Foundation PFDF in 1985 and 1986 WFOA vessels explored the fishing grounds in the South Pacific with 3 vessels in 1985 and 4 vessels in
WCPFC9-2012-OP09,5,In 1985 the PFDF contributed 90000 and AFRF contributed 148000 and in 1986 PFDF 115000 and AFRF 172800 for vessel charter costs and fuel expenses These were 6080 ft WFOA member boats which transited from the US west coast over 4000 nm to the fishing grounds in the South Pacific on which they spent an average of 3 months fishing tagging and documenting their catch The general areas covered were from 35 S latitude to 42 S latitude and from 145 W longitude to 165 W longitude Very good sign of albacore was had in most regions on jigs with the average size from 1318 pounds Fish were also dart tagged along the way
WCPFC9-2012-OP09,6,After 1986 US vessels began fishing in the South Pacific selffunded and did very well The fishery lasted from MidDecember through early April and was generally centered about 800 nm south of American Samoa and Tahiti Weather was always a factor in that area known to sailors as the roaring forties From 1987 1998 anywhere from 12 55 US boats ranging in size from 50ft to 90 ft fished in the region Total catches were as high as 5500 tons with CPUEs also very good compared to the North Pacific
WCPFC9-2012-OP09,7,Vessels in those years were predominantly brinefreezing their albacore and selling to StarKist or COSI in American Samoa Some of the catch was also transshipped to Samoa by high seas carries contracted through Marine Chartering Co of San Francisco and on one occasion to Bangkok Very detailed records were kept by WFOA on the carrier transshipping
WCPFC9-2012-OP09,8,As freezing systems changed and quality was stressed the markets changed more toward the sashimi grade fish and these vessels generally shipped fish from Tahiti and New Zealand to Asian markets Many of the larger vessels took the fish directly back to Vancouver BC A few boats also unloaded in Ecuador and in 2001 all albacore landed went through Bumble Bee Seafoods in Fiji for loining and then shipped to Santa Fe Springs for canning
WCPFC9-2012-OP09,9,After 1998 fuel and the wear and tear of fishing in the South Pacific was a self regulating factor The number of participants have diminished from the high of 55 to less than 10 vessels although 2012 saw an effort by 13 vessels The price of fuel has been the main limiting factor
WCPFC9-2012-OP09,10,To this date there are no other fleets of any nation fishing albacore in that area except for 12 from Canada and rarely a few from New Zealand There is absolutely no longline effort south of 30 S in the area east of the dateline The albacore are traditional jig fish 1225 pounds 24 year old age class
WCPFC9-2012-OP09,11,AFRF continued to do dart tagging in the South Pacific until around 1998 In 2000 AFRF sent 2 vessels on a charter off the Chilean EEZ and found mainly bad weather although in the past vessels venturing over to the Easter Island area have found considerable sign of fish
WCPFC9-2012-OP09,12,Weather and costs are very regulating issues for the South Pacific fleet and its a very serious commitment to take part in it However it has been very good and could be again We believe the fish are available but with so little fishing effort occurring now it is difficult to remain on the fish
WCPFC9-2012-OP09,13,This fishery has zero effects on the albacore stocks in the South Pacific and is totally separate from the longline fishery in the areas of both amount of catch and age class it catches It would be a shame to divide up the fishery in some sort of catch share scheme that may be appropriate for the longline fleet but not for the albacore troll fleet

WCPFC9-2012-OP10,3,Dolphin Safe and Tuna Sustainability
WCPFC9-2012-OP10,4,Earth Island Institute is the organization that maintains and verifies the international Dolphin Safe and Dolphin Friendly logos for canned tuna worldwide We instigated the label in as the first seafood ecolabel More than 460 tuna companies around the world representing more than 95 of the world tuna market subscribe to the nonencirclement Dolphin Safe standard
WCPFC9-2012-OP10,5,Our purpose is to provide information regarding sustainable fishing methods and tuna markets and address confusing or misleading claims made about tuna fishing operations
WCPFC9-2012-OP10,6,Skipjack tuna the main target for canned tuna are a relatively shortlived fish with a high reproductive rates and sustainable populations No skipjack stocks are currently considered depleted or overfished
WCPFC9-2012-OP10,7,Yellowfin tuna stocks are generally healthy although the best scientific information suggests that they may be overfished in the Eastern Tropical Pacific and at maximum utilization in the Western and Central Pacific
WCPFC9-2012-OP10,8,Bigeye tuna stocks are depleted in the Pacific Ocean but not overexploited in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans Regional Fisheries Management Organizations RFMOs supported by the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation ISSF and nongovernmental organizations NGOs including Earth Island Institute support closures on purse seine fishing to prevent overfishing of bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks
WCPFC9-2012-OP10,9,Fishing Vessel Capacity The ISSF advocates a reduction in the number of tuna vessels to again reduce worldwide pressure on tuna stocks and avoid overfishing Earth Island and other NGOs support this effort
WCPFC9-2012-OP10,10,Sea Turtles Contrary to various information being circulated catches of sea turtles in tuna purse seine nets is minimal and most sea turtles are taken alive and can be released from the nets Earth Island Institute first proposed to require live release of sea turtles from tuna nets in the mid1990s and most tuna RFMOs have now also adopted this restriction As a result very few sea turtles are harmed or die in tuna fishing operations using purse seine nets
WCPFC9-2012-OP10,11,Shark bycatch is still a problem with about 1 of purse seine bycatch being shark species 70 of sharks taken are still alive and can be released and Earth Island Dolphin Safe standards require live release and no shark finning RFMOs have made some progress in restricting finning of sharks Fishing closures also help relieve the impact on sharks The ISSF has adopted new provisions to reduce shark bycatch and is conducting experiments with fishermen to release sharks alive from tuna nets For more information httpiss foundationorgscienceprojectsbycatchreduction
WCPFC9-2012-OP10,12,Fish Aggregating Devices FADs It is our view that in conjunction with restrictions to reduce overfishing and release live bycatch FAD fishing can be considered a sustainable fishing method We support studies including those currently being conducted by the ISSF to find ways to reduce bycatch when using FADs
WCPFC9-2012-OP10,13,We support trial efforts of FADfree tuna fishing operations so long as they are undertaken by companies that fully adhere to our nonencirclement Dolphin Safe policy In order to verify such operations there needs to be clear chainofcustody and monitoring While FADfree fishing methods result in less bycatch than current fishing on FADs FADfree is unlikely to provide the predominant portion of world market for canned tuna FADfree fishing has other environmental consequences such as an increased carbon footprint due to the need for boats to travel longer distances to find schools of tuna and potential effects on fish species used as bait FAD fishing which should be closely regulated is expected to continue to be a significant part of canned tuna supply

WCPFC9-2012-OP11,5,The Secretariat of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals CMS is interested in the discussions at the annual meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC December 37 2012 in the Philippines with respect to protecting whale sharks Rhincodon typus from bycatch mortality associated with purse seine nets WCPFC9DP12
WCPFC9-2012-OP11,6,Australia a CMS Party and Signatory to the CMS Memorandum of Understanding MoU on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks has proposed inter alia banning the intentional setting of purse seines around whale sharks that sometimes occurs as fishermen pursue the tuna that can aggregate under this large shark
WCPFC9-2012-OP11,7,The whale shark is one of seven species of sharks listed on the CMS Appendices and covered by the CMS Shark MoU
WCPFC9-2012-OP11,8,Signatories to the CMS Sharks MOU that are members or cooperating nonmembers of the WCPFC include Australia European Union Nauru Palau Philippines Tuvalu United States of America Vanuatu and Senegal Furthermore the Cook Islands France New Zealand Panama and Ecuador are Parties to the Convention
WCPFC9-2012-OP11,9,The new Conservation Plan adopted in September 2012 by the Signatories to the CMS Shark MoU calls attention to the threat of bycatch to CMS listed sharks and urges the following
WCPFC9-2012-OP11,10,To the extent practicable develop andor use selective gear devices and techniques to ensure that the take of sharks in fisheries is sustainable and appropriately managed and that mortality of nonutilized catches is minimized to the greatest extent possible
WCPFC9-2012-OP11,11,The proposal from Australia to prohibit the deliberate setting of purse seine nets around whale sharks to mitigate the impact of inadvertent encirclement and to report interactions to appropriate authorities is therefore in line with the CMS Shark MoU and Conservation Plan

WCPFC10-2013-OP01,2,ISSF POSITION STATEMENT Presented during the 10th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission in Cairns Australia 2 6 December 2013
WCPFC10-2013-OP01,3,The International Seafood Sustainability Foundation ISSF is a global partnership among the tuna industry science and WWF the global conservation organization Our mission is to work toward the sciencebased conservation and management of tuna stocks and the protection of ocean health by supporting regional fisheries management organizations and advocating for the recommendations of each organizations scientific advisory body The first part of our statement addresses three of the most important issues facing global tuna sustainability reference points and harvest control rules fleet capacity and the management of FADs The second part addresses challenges specific to the WCPFC GLOBAL ISSUES Harvest Control Rules HCRs and Reference Points HCRs are a set of welldefined management actions to be taken in response to changes in stock status with respect to target and limit reference points Unless there is a preagreed upon action plan for avoiding overfishing or for rebuilding an overfished stock long negotiations lead to delayed action or inaction This delay can lead to further damage to the stock requiring even more aggressive curtailing of fishing The adoption of HCRs is a key aspect of modern fisheries management and is also a requirement of several ecolabel certification programs ISSF endorses the application of the Precautionary Approach using clear target and limit reference points and HCRs as called for by the UN Fish Stocks Agreement and by some RFMO Conventions While most tuna RFMOs have at least begun consideration of limit reference points through their science committees none have fully implemented these measures ISSF urges all tuna RFMOs to adopt stockspecific limit and target reference points and HCRs This is one of the most important actions that RFMO members can take to ensure the longterm sustainability of tuna stocks In 2012 the WCPFC adopted limit reference points for skipjack bigeye yellowfin and South Pacific albacore This was an important first step Now the WCPFC needs to adopt target reference points for these same stocks ISSF supports the adoption of the stockspecific target reference points and the recommendations by SC9 regarding calculating uncertainty ISSF looks forward to substantial progress on target reference points and HCRs at the upcoming Second Management Objectives Workshop ISSF urges CCMs to give this matter the highest priority at WCPFC10
WCPFC10-2013-OP01,4,Closed Vessel Registries and Management of Fleet Capacity Experts agree that there is overcapacity in the global tuna fleets Fishing fleet overcapacity increases pressure to weaken management measures and eventually leads to stock overexploitation The first step towards managing capacity is to establish limited entry via a comprehensive closed vessel registry with an eye towards ultimately reducing the number of fishing vessels to an appropriate level The IATTC is the only tuna RFMO with a closed vessel registry although current capacity is well in excess of resource productivity ISSF supports the Kobe III call for a freeze in purse seine fishing capacity by developed fishing nations and creating mechanisms to transfer capacity to developing countries with aspirations to participate in these fisheries These steps should be taken now since scaling back fleet capacity will become even more difficult as new vessels are introduced To this end ISSF urges the following actions All tuna RFMOs develop capacity transfer mechanisms to allow for increased participation by developing countries without an increase in overall capacity while ensuring effective monitoring and control of the fisheries All tuna RFMOs establish rules for monitoring and managing the movement of fishing capacity among the respective Convention Areas All tuna RFMOs require unique vessel identifiers such as IMO numbers in order to strengthen their ability to monitor fishing capacity globally through the Consolidated List of Authorized Vessels CLAV ISSF supports the proposal made by the United States at TCC9 WCPFCTCC92013DP03 to make an IMO number mandatory for purseseine vessels that are steelhulled and 100 GT or GRT by January 1 2015 ISSF urges CCMs to adopt a requirement for IMO numbers at WCPFC10 and encourages the Commission to include the development of a purseseine capacity transfer mechanism in its workplan for 2015 Fish Aggregating Device FAD Management Setting on FADs accounts for nearly 40 of global tuna catches and 50 of global skipjack catches FADs are one of the most important fishing methods for tropical tunas Surprisingly however there are huge gaps in all RFMOs regarding the number of FADs being used and on details of fishing operations on individual FADs Observer programs can be used to collect much but not all of the information needed to appropriately monitor FADs Vessel operators can complement this information as well as provide additional information on individual FADs Collection and reporting of data that can be used to measure fishing effort by FADs is simply a must The WCPFC has adopted Minimum Standard Data Fields for observers that contain much of this information However these data are not being collected consistently as a matter of priority Further there are some types of information that an observer is unlikely or unable to collect such as FAD markings or other identifiers that would enable one to assess if a FAD is being reutilized or being set on or deployed for the first time or details on the FAD design size depth materials This is the type of information that vessel captains can easily collect but observers cannot do so routinely ISSF urges the WCPFC to take two actions this year 1 ensure that the regional observer program routinely collects the FAD data in the WCPFC Minimum Standard Fields and 2 expand the information required from vessels to include data on FAD deployments designs equipment and identification marks As noted by the SC9 it would be easiest to achieve the latter together with the development of electronic logsheets so as to avoid requiring captains to fill out a duplicate form The IOTC and IATTC adopted expanded FAD data collection measures at their annual meetings this year Therefore ISSF is pleased to see that the United States has tabled a proposal on FAD data collection and urges the WCPFC to adopt such a measure this year WCPFC CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES CMM 201201 the Purse Seine Fishery and bigeye tuna The analyses presented at SC9 corroborate the fact that CMM 201201 has been ineffective in meeting the objectives of controlling total purse seine effort and ending the overfishing of the bigeye stock The number of purse seine fishing days continues to increase the catch of bigeye and the number of FAD sets continues to increase over the 20072011 average and the number of FAD sets per day is increasing Analyses considered by SC8 and SC9 indicate that all of the following can reduce bigeye overfishing Additional management measures to limit FAD activities such as extending the FAD closure period limiting the number of FAD sets made each year or the number of FADs that each vessel uses Reducing or eliminating the exemptions in CMM 200801 which account for 50 of the bigeye overfishing Simultaneously considering fishing effort limits for the purse seine fishery and bigeye catch limits for the longline fishery ISSF urges the WCPFC to amend CMM201201 in a comprehensive manner addressing the above elements andor utilizing other science based measures that meet the objective of ending the overfishing of the bigeye stock Sharks SC9 concluded that the stocks of oceanic whitetip and silky sharks are overfished and that overfishing is occurring or highly likely to be occurring on both species It is clear from these stock assessments that catches and mortalities of these shark stocks must be urgently reduced SC9 recommended that the Commission consider measures directed at bycatch mitigation as well as measures directed at targeted catch such as from shark lines to improve the status of the silky shark population ISSF urges CCMs to adopt comprehensive and robust shark conservation and management measures including bycatch mitigation measures improved data collection and reporting and the development of stockspecific reference points ISSF further urges the Commission to take further steps to enforce the existing conservation and management measure addressing shark finning and move to the total prohibition of the atsea removal of shark fins and mandate that fins remain naturally attached for all sharks landed Longlining and Transshipment ISSF notes with concern the continuing increase in the number of longline vessels operating in the WCPFC Convention Area the significant increase in catches of albacore in the South Pacific by longline vessels the low levels of observer coverage data indicates that coverage rates may be less than the required 5 increasing numbers of transshipments at sea beyond flag State control and the failure of some CCMs to provide the required transshipment reports or advance notifications as required by CMM 200906 ISSF notes that electronic monitoring systems are being tested and developed which could potentially be used to address some of these problems ISSF urges WCPFC10 to impose and enforce as a precautionary measure measures to limit longliner capacity in the Convention Area ISSF also urges the Commission to task its scientific body to make recommendations to WCPFC11 regarding the levels of longline capacity consistent with sustainable exploitation and prudent management of target tuna stocks ISSF further urges the Commission to amend its transshipment measure CMM 2009 in order to address these significant gaps in its effectiveness which affect traceability of the products and could result in IUU fishing Compliance and Data Gaps ISSF notes with concern the SC9 information on data gaps including annual catch estimates by EEZ the number of vessels in aggregate data for some fleets shark catches and operational catcheffort data from certain fleets These data are necessary for robust stock assessments and provision of these data is a fundamental obligation of CCMs ISSF urges all CCMs to provide these data to the SPC by the agreed deadlines and in the correct formats ISSF further urges the Commission to consider appropriate responses to promote compliance by those CCMs who have not yet provided operational catch and effort data On the broader issue of compliance

working group meetings and no detailed information on the levels of compliance by member or the responses of members to identified non compliance are released publically Member reports on the implementation of WCPFC measures known as Part II reports are also confidential ISSF urges the Commission to reform its CMS process so that accredited observers may attend its meetings and its reports contain detailed information on the level of compliance by CCM and how they plan to address the areas of identified noncompliance ISSF also supports the development of a scheme of responses to

WCPFC10-2013-OP02,2,Greenpeace Briefing to the 10th Regular Meeting of WCPFC Greenpeace Briefing to the 10th Regular Meeting of WCPFC Cairns Australia 2 to 6 December 2013 Introduction Delegates to the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC have in recent years witnessed very frustrating negotiations Parties have agreed measures based on lowest common denominators which were satisfactory to no one they have showed a lack of will to make difficult choices and worst of all they have compromised the future of Pacific tuna fisheries The result has been ineffective conservation measures that were destined to fail Greenpeace therefore attends this th Annual Meeting of the WCPFC in the hope that the dynamics of previous meetings will be significantly changed The Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPO is in urgent need of fishing capacity reduction and effective controls on fishing effort Both aspects capacity and effort limitations need to work together and parties should recognise they are not mutually exclusive Precautionary target and limit reference points required under the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO Code of Conduct and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement must be adopted Some stocks of great importance continue to be managed unsustainably namely bigeye tuna yellowfin and Pacific bluefin tuna with southern albacore fisheries becoming uneconomical as stocks decline Many shark populations are seriously depleted or stock levels are extremely uncertain and they need to be put on the road to recovery In summary Greenpeace urges parties to the WCPFC to collaborate in order to set the foundations for a sustainable future for WCPO tuna fisheries namely by agreeing an immediate cap on new built longline and purse vessels in the region by developed parties and a clear timebound plan to assess and eliminate overcapacity using environmental and social criteria putting in place an effort management system which works regionally and includes all gears and waters adopting precautionary and ecosystembased target and limit reference points for all major tuna and billfish species closing the loopholes in the fight against Illegal Unregulated and Unreported IUU fishing starting by banning at sea transshipments by all vessels including longliners In addition Greenpeace calls on WCPFC parties to ensure the following pressing issues are effectively addressed at the upcoming meeting a strong Conservation and Management Measure CMM is agreed that ends bigeye tuna overfishing and ensures tropical tuna fisheries are managed according to precautionary and ecosystem based principles taking into account the conservation of all targeted and associated species increases in fishing effort in the southern albacore fishery are immediately halted and precautionary zonebased catch limits are established by the Commission a moratorium on Pacific bluefin tuna fishing is agreed until the stock is recovered and effective management measures are in place effective measures to recover depleted shark populations are taken All parties must be prepared to make compromises to reach agreement What cannot be compromised is the future of Pacific tuna stocks 1 Greenpeace Briefing to the 10th Regular Meeting of WCPFC Addressing the most pressing issues1 Produce an effective clear and enforceable CMM for tropical tunas Although there have been no new tuna stock assessments in 2013 it is clear from the range of fisheries indicators provided for 2012 that the situation for several tuna stocks in the Western and Central Pacific continues to deteriorate as effort increases have resulted in record catches in the region since 200912 Overfishing of adult bigeye in the longline fishery compounded by the increased catches of juveniles as bycatch in purse seine fishing on fish aggregating devices FADs has continued to reduce the bigeye stock to worrying levels The Scientific Committee warned this year that everincreasing catches are exacerbating this problem CMM200801 and subsequent amendments aimed to reduce the high fishing mortality on bigeye tuna by 30 per cent from the 20012004 average level and limit yellowfin tuna fishing mortality to its 2004 level Data presented at Scientific Committee meetings SC7 SC8 and SC9 have made it clear that the CMM200801 was insufficient to achieve these goals34 Longline catches of bigeye have been reduced from 20012004 levels although they have increased slightly in recent years In the core area of the tropical longline fishery catch reductions have occurred alongside a decline in catchperuniteffort CPUE and therefore recent catch declines may be at least in part due to a further decline in the adult bigeye abundance rather than conservation efforts by member States Scientific advice indicates that a combination of prohibiting FADs in the purse seine fishery and restricting longline fishing in bigeye spawning areas would have the greatest impact on the recovery of bigeye tuna The FAD closures in 20092012 resulted in moderately reduced yellowfin and skipjack catches and strongly reduced bigeye catches during the closure periods However despite the closures the total estimated number of FAD sets made in 2011 was a record high mainly due to increased purse seine effort overall with a slight decline in set numbers for 2012 Any proposed replacement of current FAD measures must take into account the burdens of monitoring and enforcing FAD closures and the impact FADs may be having during the closure period in terms of ghost fishing Similarly the drastic reduction in bigeye catches during FAD closure months should be the single most important factor to consider when deliberating the new measure The FAD ban must be yearround to ensure that the benefit of reduced bigeye tuna mortality gained during a shortterm ban are not lost over the remainder of the year A full ban will reduce the bycatch of juvenile yellowfin and assist in the overall reduction of shark bycatch most importantly for depleted oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks This would also most effectively address the unregulated nature of capacity creep in the purse seine fleets due to the proliferation of FAD use Measures must be agreed too on the longline fishery through a combination of prohibiting longlining in bigeye spawning areas closing the high seas pockets to all longline fishing and further reducing fishing effort and capacity within all longline fleets within the remaining high seas and Exclusive Economic Zones EEZs The following components should be included in the new CMM on tropical tunas an objective to reduce fishing mortality of bigeye by 50 per cent from 2011 levels including further cuts to both longline and purse seine bigeye catches the closure of all four high seas pockets to all fishing as a permanent measure Harley S Williams P 2013 A compendium of fisheries indicators for bigeye skipjack yellowfin and

an effective reduction and control of fishing effort adoption and implementation of a yearround ban on the use of FADs in association with purse seine fishing in order to help address excess fishing capacity reduce catches of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna and reduce bycatch of other vulnerable species2 Safeguard albacore tuna Greenpeace again reiterates concern over the increasing number of small to medium scale longliners operating only on the high seas targeting albacore These vessels place an increasing burden on this stock and contribute very little to the economies of adjacent Pacific coastal States as they compete with domestic and locallyowned fleets Although albacore stocks are still considered to be relatively healthy the Scientific Committee has consistently cautioned against further increases in catch on the basis that they would reduce vulnerable biomass larger adults and therefore decrease catch rates and profitability Despite these warnings both catch and effort have increased significantly in recent years Stock assessments have shown a declining spawning biomass Greenpeace urges the Commission to immediately halt any increase in effort in the southern albacore fishery until precautionary zonebased catch limits are established by the Commission that takes into account the rights of adjacent small island coastal States whose small economies are dependent on this fishery3 Conserve shark populations Greenpeace calls on the Commission to urgently address the status of shark populations including by addressing impacts on them by all gears Although sharks are often described as bycatch in longline fisheries it is clear from the common use of practices that deliberately increase shark catches that more longline fisheries should be described as mixed fisheries targeting tuna sharks and billfish These include the use of wire tracers shark lines and bait that attracts sharks5 and crew payment structures that incentivise shark finning6 Oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks despite the poor data available are likely to be in a very poor state with fishing rates well in excess of the FMSY and with stocks declines to well below SBMSY78 In the case of silky sharks the greatest impact on the stock is attributed to bycatch from the longline fishery but there are also significant impacts from the associated purse seine fishery which catches predominantly juveniles The fishing mortality from the associated purse seine fishery is itself above FMSY Initial attempts to provide stock assessments for blue sharks this year have again highlighted extremely poor data available on shark catches Even then several models do indicate that this heavily exploited North Pacific stock may be in an overfished state9 SC9 recommended that a revised assessment be presented at SC10 and in the interim the Commission should adopt the precautionary approach when considering potential management measures for this stock10 Given the importance of sharks in the Pacific ecosystem and the continuing poor availability of data this Commission should agree on a total prohibition of the retention transhipment storage onboard

Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks114 Rescue Pacific bluefin tuna This year SC9 had the opportunity to review the 2012 Pacific bluefin tuna assessment12 presented by the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC The report suggests a catastrophic depletion of Pacific bluefin down to 4 per cent of the unfished biomass with continued overfishing of all ageclasses including an extremely high mortality rate for juveniles of 90 per cent Although consensus was not reached the majority of SC9 recommended an urgent reduction of fishing mortality especially on juveniles and that limit and target reference points be agreed that are consistent with the Commissions adopted or default reference points The InterAmerican tropical Tuna Commission IATTC has adopted a catch limit for the eastern Pacific however there have been no limits set by the WCPFC for the western Pacific where the vast majority of catches are taken Given the dire state of the Pacific bluefin tuna population Greenpeace calls on the Commission to agree on a moratorium on all directed Pacific bluefin tuna fishing until such time that a management plan is agreed and implemented and the stock has shown conclusive evidence of recovery to levels above an agreed biomass limit reference point Building the basis for sustainable tuna fisheries management in the region Indicators from the 9th Regular Session of the WCPFC Science Committee SC9 have revealed an alarming picture of the current fishing capacity in the convention area13 The elimination of fishing overcapacity is one of the most serious challenges facing all tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisations RFMOs purse seine and longline vessel numbers capacity and overall fishing effort are at an alltime high in the WCPO1415 Since the introduction of CMM200801 there has been an increase in purse seine effort Effort peaked in 2011 however VMS data shows that effort in 2012 was 8 per cent higher than 2010 levels and similar to 2011 effort levels In addition the efficiency of the effort has increased and there appears to have been a change in how days are

transit days counted as nonfishing days16 Overcapacity is a main driver of overfishing Fishing capacity management schemes mostly deal with amount of capacity such as vessel numbers and size engine power but rarely if ever with the type of vessel and its gear and their environmental and social impacts1 Eliminate overcapacity Greenpeace has just produced the report Managing Fishing Capacity in the Western and Central Pacific Tuna Fisheries which outlines a process by which the appropriate amount and type of capacity can be first identified in the WCPO and the least environmentally and socially sustainable capacity can be eliminated Work to eliminate overcapacity must provide for the equitable allocation of access to resources using a set of transparent and equitable environmental and social criteria that ensure the rights of developing coastal States and communities to participate in and benefit from tuna fisheries Greenpeace is advocating that coastal States develop domestic tuna fisheries based on selective fishing techniques that are more suitable for use by coastal communities and have a lower impact on the ecosystem in terms of limiting bycatch17 In doing so the rights and needs of developing coastal States could be addressed at the same time replacing more unsustainable distant water fishing capacity in the region Greenpeace is calling on the Commission to urgently agree to cap the number of longline and purse seine vessels in the fishery and prioritise the development of a clear timebound plan to assess and eliminate overcapacity in the WCPO that takes into consideration social and environmental criteria for reducing overcapacity in tuna fisheries18 This process should identify the most environmentally and socially appropriate type and amount of fishing capacity that should be allowed in a given fishery so as to manage it sustainably This could constitute the basis for a scheme which would grant preferential access to vessels and gears which score the highest Further allocation of the right to fish to individual operators should be based on a participatory and transparent decisionmaking framework and should exclude those with poor records of reporting and compliance Local fishing communities fulfilling the criteria should have primary access Greenpeace recommends that the following criteria be adopted within the plan to eliminate overcapacity from WCPO tuna fisheries to guide decisions on which vessels and fleets should be granted the fishing opportunities available under a precautionary management model Selectivity fishing methods with low bycatch Environmental impact less destructive fishing methods Energy consumption vessels and fishing methods consuming less energy per tonne of fish caught Employment and working conditions fishing methods that provide more and better employment conditions compliant with international standards Socio economic benefits greater direct income to and investment in the region derived from the fishing operations Quality of product gear types providing the best quality of fish for human consumption History of compliance past compliance with applicable rules including quality of data provided by fishers as well as member states should be considered when granting access to a fishery Pilling G Williams P Hampton J Harley S 2013 Analysis of the implementation and

working conditions socioeconomic benefits quality of the product and history of compliance among others 5 Greenpeace Briefing to the 10th Regular Meeting of WCPFC2 Ensure effective effort management Limits to both capacity and effort are required As long as excess fishing capacity in terms of physical assets vessels etc exists vessels owners and companies will continue to exert political pressure to ensure that they obtain maximum fisheries access to remain financially viable and will maintain a situation where breaking the rules is seen as a necessary risk Currently the main tool to manage fishing effort in the WCPO is the Parties to the Nauru Agreement PNA Vessel Day Scheme VDS Due to several exemptions to the system as well as its current scope it only applies to the EEZs of PNA members the VDS has not managed to date to prevent an expansion of both fishing capacity and effort in the region Greenpeace believes that in order to be effective as a fisheries management tool19 the VDS must be expanded in its scope and include all fishing effort in the region including all gears and all waters20 A stringent monitoring and penalty system must also be put into place and enforced In addition Greenpeace warns that a wellfunctioning VDS doesnt remove the need for capacity management In the absence of capacity management consistent with environmental and social access and allocation criteria a reduced number of days available under the VDS alone would expel the least financially strong operators potentially benefiting the most industrial or heavily subsidised operations that can bid at higher prices for VDS days To avoid such an outcome the VDS should be applied after preferential access has been granted to local fishing communities operating in a sustainable manner Greater economic benefits for coastal states can be derived from their own local fisheries as opposed to foreign access fees making this an even more economically beneficial option in the long term Following allocation of local fishing opportunities any remaining vessel days could be sold to operators best fulfilling the environmental and social criteria and contributing the most to sustainable livelihoods in the region as opposed to simple financial contribution of access fees as is the current practice3 Adopt precautionary target and limit reference points Setting strong fisheries reference points and strict harvest control rules is a key part of implementing the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement Some of the work carried out so far at the WCPFC on choosing and setting target and limit reference points is described in more detail in the Greenpeace submission to the SC921 Greenpeace considers progress in this area to be crucial for the future success of the Commission Both target and limit reference points need to be precautionary and the risk of breaching a reference point needs to be very low While ultimately the assurance that limit reference points are not breached by fisheries depends on choosing good target reference points and strong harvest control rules and on swift action by management Greenpeace also believes that a sea change in how managers and industry perceive and understand target and limit reference points is key to gaining agreement for significantly improving management of Pacific fisheries The Commission has previously adopted the biomass limit reference points LRPs for tuna and striped marlin recommended by the Scientific Committee in 2012 SC8 Greenpeace urges the Commission to adopt the recommendations of SC9 to select fishing mortality limit reference points for each species that ensure a high probability that biomass LRPs will not be breached22 Greenpeace supports the selection of a 5 per cent acceptable risk level for all species ie 95 probability of maintaining the stock above biomass LRPs Greenpeace further urges the Commission to set limit and target reference points for all species managed by the WCPFC The VDS has been undoubtedly effective as a tool to increase the revenue obtained by PNA countries from the tuna resources in their EEZs

Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC httpwwwwcpfcintnode4914 6 Greenpeace Briefing to the 10th Regular Meeting of WCPFC4 Tackle illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing Atsea transhipments continue to represent one of the most important loopholes assisting IUU operations Greenpeace ship expeditions in 2006 2008 2009 2011 and 2012 repeatedly demonstrated the extensive and pernicious nature of IUU fishing in the region and the role that these high seas areas play in facilitating illegal fishing Following the closure of two high seas pockets HSPs to purse seine fishing since 1 January 2010 purse seine fishing effort remained largely concentrated in EEZs until 2012 In 2012 there was an increase in the amount of purse seine effort in the HSPs attributed to transit activity andor to effort by the Philippines vessels permitted under CMM 201101 Governments and domestic longline fleets in the central Pacific have indicated their concern over international fleets operating solely in the eastern high seas pocket and using this as a platform to tranship catch out of the region In 2012 a high seas boarding and inspection patrol boarded 11 vessels in this pocket and detected violations on six of these including nonreporting of entry23 In 2013 11 vessels were boarded again and six of these vessels were found in violation of existing CMMs again including for nonreporting of entry into the high seas pocket as required under the special management measure The reopening of high seas pockets 1 and 2 at WCPFC8 came with a number of preconditions including the need for better monitoring of fleets and strict implementation of and compliance with monitoring control and surveillance MCS measures Subsequent activities by Philippine vessels in high seas pocket 1 and neighbouring EEZs reveal a number of concerning issues Since the Technical and Compliance Committees meeting TCC8 in 2012 Greenpeace documented a raft of IUU activities and other anomalies by vessels fishing in high seas pocket 1 including Philippine flagged vessels These were reported to the Commission2425 in Manila in December 2012 However despite the clear documentation those cases somehow did not prevent the Philippines from receiving a good rating for compliance at TCC9 The activities documented included an unlicensed Philippine fishing vessel Sal 19 transshipping illegally on the high seas failure by a licensed high seas seiner Geneviva to report via VMS to the adjacent coastal states as required under Philippine regulations and no VMS reporting at all by Sal 19 Upon approach by Greenpeace the IUU transshipment was halted and three of the vessels involved fled into Indonesias EEZ Sal 19 was spotted eight days later in Palaus EEZ with its name painted over not reporting on either VMS or AIS and with no log book or other fishing or transhipment records Furthermore Greenpeace and Palauan authorities while on joint patrol of Palaus EEZ in November 2012 discovered a number of illegally deployed anchored FADs within Palau waters near the high seas border similar in construction to those being deployed by the Philippine purse seiners on the high seas Those blatant IUU activities highlight the need to phase out the exemption for Philippine purse seiners to fish in the high seas and call into question the rigour of the compliance assessment process being followed by TCC At the very least compliance discussions should be open to accredited observers and the country whose compliance is being discussed while having the opportunity to respond to issues raised should not be able to block consensus on a poor score Furthermore all reported IUU incidents from any source should be included in the next TCC compliance discussion and placed on a public record Greenpeace calls on the Commission to recommend that all four high seas pockets be permanently closed to all forms of fishing as part of a new conservation measure for skipjack yellowfin and bigeye This must include a phase out of the Philippine purse seine fleet from the high seas pocket during the lifetime of the tropical tuna CMM as part of a national plan to reduce overcapacity and ensure sustainable fisheries also inside Philippine EEZ Bunkering and atsea transhipments should be banned In addition the Commissions Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS currently in its third trial year must be strengthened and a strict penalty and sanctions regime must be applied in all TCC 2013 Annual Report on Eastern High Seas Pocket Special Management Area ReportingTechnical and Compliance

httpbitlySyxxi2 Greenpeace International findings at sea November 2012 httpbitlyVj8637 7 Greenpeace Briefing to the 10th Regular Meeting of WCPFC cases of noncompliance Failure to comply must be linked to loss of access thereby contributing to the process of reducing fishing capacity In addition to closing the high seas pockets to fishing and banning transshipments at sea the WCPFC must also act to create a meaningful disincentive to IUU fishing It is of extreme concern that some vessels and fleets appear to have made IUU fishing part of their business model despite repeated settlement payments In many cases the value of the tuna catch and level of subsidies received by the vessel or company mean that those settlements although significant are not alone enough to change behaviour The WCPFC must remove the secrecy surrounding compliance discussions and place all IUU activity from the past year onto the public record regardless of whether settlement has been reached or a vessel is blacklisted This enables legal and ethical traders to avoid buying fish that may have been stolen from Pacific Island countries Furthermore IUU compliance records must be a criterion within a transparent system of evaluating vessels and companies before fishing access is granted When capacity reduction is a critical task ahead of the Commission those vessels that have repeatedly violated CMMs should be the first to be removed from the fishery5 Operate with transparency Greenpeace together with other nongovernment organisations has expressed its concern at the disturbing trend regarding the level of transparency and openness in WCPFC meetings and information sharing by the Commission This includes the increasing number of closed sessions documents being posted on the secure website unavailable to organisations with accredited observer status and draft meeting reports being sent only to member states and not to other organisations that attended and contributed to those meetings We recognise the need under exceptional circumstances for documents or discussions to be restricted as provided for under the WCPFCs rules However we believe that currently much of this information is unnecessarily limited and too many discussions are inappropriately designated as confidential The WCPFC is no longer following best practice by RFMOs with regards to transparency and we urge an improvement at WCPFC10 and in future meetings and working groups6 Share the burdens and benefits The WCPFC Convention Article 30 states the need to ensure that such measures do not result in transferring directly or indirectly a disproportionate burden of conservation action onto developing States Parties and territories and possessions and this issue has been raised in regard to the replacement measure for 200
01 In order to address this a compensation payment has been suggested by Pacific Island States Greenpeace urges all Parties to ensure that this discussion does not delay the agreement of a strong replacement measure to protect tropical tunas from which all parties will share the benefits to approach the discussion of a new measure for tropical tunas prepared to accept cuts and to seek compromise for the longterm benefit of the fisheries Any compensation arrangement agreed should be adopted only as a step towards ultimately ensuring that the benefits of all sectors of the fishery and therefore the benefits from stock conservation are better directed towards Small Island Developing States An alternative model for the development of such an arrangement is outlined in the Greenpeace report Transforming Tuna Fisheries in Pacific Island Countries For further information please contact Lagi Toribau Head of Greenpeace Delegation to WCPFC10 lagitoribaugreenpeaceorg 8,,

WCPFC10-2013-OP03,2,Recommendations to the 10th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission6 December 2013 Cairns Australia A brief from Nov 2013 The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC aims to ensure the longterm conservation and sustainable use of the fish stocks including tuna and sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean The WCPFC has a unique and important responsibility as custodian of the worlds largest tuna fishery in an area covering 20 percent of the Earths surface Sustaining healthy fisheries in this region requires strong conservation and management actions through joint commitments and strict compliance Unfortunately the Commissions Members Cooperating Nonmembers and Participating Territories known collectively as CCMs have been unable to take the actions needed to ensure the sustainability of highly migratory fish populations This years Commission meeting is critical to the future of bigeye and Pacific bluefin tuna as well as many shark species The Pew Charitable Trusts calls on governments involved in the WCPFC to agree to take the following critical actions End overfishing in tuna fisheries and strengthen management to ensure sustainability Strengthen controls so as to end illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing Adopt conservation and management measures to protect sharks Recommendations End overfishing in tuna fisheries and strengthen management to ensure sustainability This year the WCPFC must demonstrate that it can manage the worlds largest tuna fishery responsibly by implementing precautionary reference points acting to end overfishing of bigeye tuna and moving to rebuild the severely depleted Pacific bluefin population Reference points The 2012 and 2013 Management Objectives Workshops provided CCMs with the information needed to implement the Convention requirement to determine appropriate reference points and conservation actions for these species of tuna1 This is an important step toward a more precautionary sciencebased management system that will better protect the ecosystem and fisheries from future declines The WCPFC should adopt interim target and limit reference points for skipjack albacore yellowfin bluefin and bigeye tuna CCMs also should continue discussions on harvestcontrol rules that ensure that limit reference points are not exceeded and that targets achieve the desired outcomes Masa Ushioda SeaPicscom Skipjack tuna Tropical tuna measure Ending overfishing of bigeye tuna Negotiations on the new tropical tuna Conservation and Management Measure CMM have failed to adhere to the scientific advice as each party to the talks worked to minimize the impact on its fishing operations This has led to an overly complex measure that relies on management tools that have already proved ineffective for this fishery and would be difficult to enforce The Commission must commit to ending overfishing of bigeye tuna by 2018 by adopting a CMM for tropical tuna that freezes fishing capacity caps longline catch and limits the amount of fishing by purseseiners on fish aggregating devices FADs to sustainable levels consistent with the advice from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community SPC The CMM must be reviewed and updated next year based on the results of the 2014 stock assessments of bigeye and yellowfin tuna The Commission must commit to ending overfishing of bigeye tuna by 2018 Alex HoffordGreenpeace via Marine Photobank A school of tuna swims in a purseseine net in Papua New Guinea waters In addition CCMs fishing with FADs should be required to submit management plans for these devices which should include information on the numbers deployed recovered and lost as well as FAD tracking data This data would give the Scientific Committee more information on the extent of FAD use the potential effects on the ecosystem tied to their uncontrolled proliferation and the scope of this fisherys contribution to marine debris It also would provide greater insight into how FAD use contributes to IUU fishing To ensure that the effectiveness of the new CMM can be measured all CCMs should provide all relevant data on their fisheries to the Commission Without this critical information on catch rates spatial patterns and the numbers of fishing vessels operating in the Convention Area cannot be confirmed Observer coverage can provide such data and all CCMs should endeavor to increase observer coverage to at least 20 percent Given the high impact that largescale freezer longliners have on target associated and dependent species the WCPFC should mandate 100 percent observer coverage on these vessels Pacific bluefin tuna Based on the International Scientific Committees ISC latest stock assessment the Pacific bluefin population is at just 36 percent of its original size and both the ISC and the WCPFC Scientific Committee have recommended that fishing mortality be reduced from recent levels to limit the risk of further population declines At its 2013 meeting however the Commissions Northern Committee recommended a measure that would allow overall catch to rise above levels seen in the last two years In doing so the Northern Committee has again agreed to management measures that are inadequate to protect this severely depleted species Therefore the WCPFC should recommend that the Northern Committee develop a rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin tuna for adoption by the 11th Regular Session of the WCPFC that includes catch limits that would return the population to 25 percent SSBrecent F0 25 percent of the original population size within the next 10 years If the WCPFC again fails to adopt and implement appropriate management measures fishing for Pacific bluefin tuna should be suspended until such precautionary sciencebased measures are put in place Strengthen controls against IUU fishing IUU fishing remains a threat in the WCPFC Convention Area To enhance compliance with CMMs the Commission should require that vessels fishing in its waters have mandatory unique and permanent identification numbers The WCPFC also should adopt a new measure on port State controls The International Maritime Organization IMO number is an essential element of any system to ensure compliance with fisheries laws and to aid safety and security at sea2 The WCPFC should improve the transparency of fishing vessels activities by requiring that those licensed to fish in the Convention Area have an IMO number The Commission also should Require members to submit the IMO number of any vessel authorized to fish in the Convention Area that already has such a number and mandate that the number be included in the Commission Record of Fishing Vessels Require that all vessels3 authorized to fish in the WCPFC Convention Area have an IMO number by Jan 1 and that this number be reported in all records and relevant communications involving these vessels The number should be permanently marked in a visible place on the vessels hull Courtesy of Australian Fisheries Management Authority Vessel crew paints a new name on the hull at sea to avoid enforcement for illegal fishing crimes committed under prior name In addition port State measures PSMs are costeffective tools to prevent fish caught illegally from entering the market WCPFCs Performance Review recommended adoption of PSMs warning that the Commission is lagging behind other regional fisheries management organizations in doing so4 The WCPFC should initiate development of a regional scheme of PSMs adopting at this meeting minimum standards for port inspections and providing adequate support to developing States for implementation High seas transshipment continues to be used in the WCPFC Convention Area as a way to avoid proper catch reporting and to launder IUU catch The WCPFC should introduce a ban on high seas transshipment until it can be ensured that transshipment operations cannot assist IUU fishing This would require having a robust monitoring system in place that includes full transparency requiring observers on board the offloading and receiving vessels and complete oversight by the Commission of all transshipment operations in the Convention Area The WCPFC should improve the transparency of fishing vessels activities by requiring that those licensed to fish in the Convention Area have an IMO number Silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis Adopt CMMs to protect sharks The latest stock assessment shows that the silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis a lowproductivity species is in an overfished state in the WCPFC Convention Area and that overfishing continues5 Given this evidence the WCPFC should follow the best practice established by the Commission when it prohibited the retention of oceanic whitetip sharks It is essential that the WCPFC prohibit the retention on board transshipment storage and landing of silky sharks this year This will be most effective in combination with improved shark bycatchmitigation measures to prevent initial catch of this and other vulnerable shark species Among the most effective are the use of nonentangling FADs6 and controls on the use of wire leaders7 shark lines and shark bait8 We recommend that the WCPFC mandate the use of nonentangling FADs and prohibit the use of wire leaders shark lines and shark bait It is essential that the

WCPFC10-2013-OP04,2,Smart Fishing Initiative WWF POSITIONth Regular Session of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC Pohnpei Federated States of Micronesia December 26 2013 Introduction and Summary The World Wide Fund for Nature WWF would like to thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC for the opportunity to attend the 10th Regular Session as an observer and to address the critically important role that it plays in the proper management of the Western Central Pacific Ocean WCPO fisheries The regulatory measures proposed and implemented by the WCPFC represent one of the legs of the threelegged stool of successful sustainable and responsible fisheries management the other legs consisting of the science provided by the Scientific Committee SC and the compliance measures provided by the Technical and Compliance Committee TCC Without firm support on each one of those three components the stool falls over and fisheries management fails WWF once again calls on members of the WCPFC to address the issues and recommendations raised at SC9 TCC9 and WCPFC9 as well as observe the experience of other RFMOs in their own efforts to achieve and maintain improved measures for monitoring and surveillance WWF wishes to reiterate its position offered in Manila in December 2012 WCPFC9 and taking into account the WCPFCrelated meetings held since the recommendations listed in bullets below For more detail and background on each position please reference the associated Appendix for this document Reference Points Harvest Control Rules and Harvest Strategies WWF recommends that the WCPFC Designate of Limit and Target Reference Points as a priority for proper management of stocks under WCPFC authority Establish precautionary Bbased Limit

Develop an analysis of the observer programme in the context of proper management including an analysis of different funding models Review and consider for endorsement or adoption the recommendations of the Association for Professional Observers contained in the International Observer Bill of Rights and associated documents Catch Documentation Scheme With respect to the development of a comprehensive CDS WWF recommends the WCPFC Consider the following elements of a robust CDS system including o A requirement for documentation to accompany all catch harvested landed transhipped traded domestically exported processed imported and reexported and which relies on electronic documentation o Complementary measures to maximize the effectiveness of the CDS through ensuring that transhipment at sea does not compromise the effectiveness of the CDS adopting Port State Measures implemented simultaneously with the CDS and adopting trade restriction measures against flag States with vessels on the IUU list o Parameters that include all species of tunas billfish and sharks managed by the WCPFC Consider additional elements to support the integrity reliability and sustainability of a CDS system including o A commitment to continuous improvement of the CDS by investigating the benefits and feasibility of verification systems such as electronic tagging and the use of biotechnology o Establishment of a capacity development fund to provide a costsharing mechanism that enables progressive cost sharing among member states and o Maximizing retailer and public access to data through modern electronic tools Conclusion WWF once again calls on the WCPFC to look carefully look at our collective conduct as nations with a responsibility for managing fishery resources in the WCPFC CA With respect to each of the agenda items addressed at the WCPFC10 Regular Meeting the commission delegates must genuinely consider whether previous actions have been responsible and commendable in achieving the overarching goal of fisheries sustainability in the WCPO Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper iv WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF POSITION The WCPFC shares the distinction as the youngest RFMO but is also regarded as arguably the most effective However we all must constantly guard against the complacency and greed that leads to poor decisionmaking resulting in the collapsing fish stocks in other regions Unfortunately with some stocks in the WCPO such as bigeye tuna oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks we are treading dangerously down a path leading to trouble The WCPFC possesses the ability and opportunity to chart the course towards sustainable fishery resources especially tuna in the WCPO The WCPFC and its subsidiary bodies must continually promote and adopt strong and effective conservation and management action to maintain and rebuild tuna stocks implement appropriate monitoring and enforcement measures promote a viable tuna industry and support vibrant coastal communities throughout the South Pacific 1986 Panda Symbol WWF World Wide Fund For Nature Formerly World

Points Harvest Control Rules and Harvest Strategies WWF remains supportive of the work of the WCPFC and subsidiary bodies in pursuing the implementation of Reference Points RP Harvest Control Rules HCR and Harvest Strategies HS WWF encourages WCPFC10 to endorse and support the adoption of explicit Limit and Target Reference Points LRPTRP for all WCPO fishery stocks under WCPFC authority developed through the subsidiary bodies as well as the Management Objectives Workshop Reference points provide management decisionmakers an objective tool to determine whether a fish stock size is becoming too small or fishing pressure is becoming too great WWF notes that the WCPFC has discussed and considered RPs since 2006 and that while the SC and TCC have made several recommendations to the WCPFC on appropriate RPs the WCPFC has failed to adopt formal explicit RPs Furthermore while stock assessments conducted by SPC use BMSY and FMSY as implicit LRPs and provide advice to the WCPFC these proxies do not represent limits consistent with the recommendations of the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement UNFSA and more refined RPs are justified based on the available scientific information1 The WCPFC must implement RPs and HCRs as a priority for the sustainable management of the fishery resources in the WCPO Existing science supports the implementation of welldefined and precautionary biologicallybased LRPs and WWF generally supports the previous recommendations of the SC Therefore WWF supports the recommendations of SC8 and SC9 that LRPs for bigeye tuna BET yellowfin tuna YFT and South Pacific albacore ALB be set at Level 2 with regard to the biomassbased LRP of 20SBrecentF0 with the application of a sufficiently precautionary value of X in the Level 2 fishing mortalitybased LRP of FxSPR2 Furthermore WWF suggests that the WCPFC should acknowledge that LRPs are predominantly scientific in nature and may be set completely independently of and without relationship to TRPs At the SC9 meeting in Pohnpei most Members Cooperating Nonmembers and Participating Territories CCMs reiterated a preference for establishing biomass Bbased LRPs While the assumptions uncertainties and substantial amounts of information associated with biomass B based LRPs make them a less attractive option to some stakeholders they constitute a critical tool to ensure that stock sustainability is maintained Fbased LRPs are important and useful but not as critical as a Bbased limit because a Bbased limit ensures a biological floor that the fishery cannot go Gregg Yan WWF POSITION DECEMBER Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF POSITION below Reference points that specify a minimum biomass level for the stock below which the fishery is curtailed or in the extreme case closed have the advantages that Biomass is more directly linked to recruitment than is the fishing mortality rate Minimum biomass levels provide a guide for management of stocks that are already depleted by setting a standard for rebuilding and During periods of adverse environmental conditions a minimum biomass level provides a seed stock for eventual recovery when conditions are more favourable In 2012 WCPFC9 requested the SC9 develop appropriate timewindows for analyzing and calculating unfished biomass levels WWF supports the recommendation of SC9 that the timewindow to be used in the LRP 20SBF0 t1t2 satisfies the following criteria have a length of 10 years be based on the years t1ylast10 to t2ylast1 where ylast is the last year used in the assessment and the approach used for calculating the unfished biomass levels be based on scaled estimates of recruitment according to the stock recruitment relationship WWF generally supports the implementation of any Management Strategy Evaluation MSE measures that serve to improve the understanding of the impacts of particular management measures Thus consistent with SC9 advice WWF endorses the recommendation that this timewindow be subject to periodic review to ensure this approach is appropriately representing future conditions for the individual stocks While WWF continues to hold that the establishment of Bbased limits are more important because they ensure a biological floor that the fishery cannot go below we nonetheless believe that Fbased LRPs also represent useful tools to control fishing capacity or in other words the rate at which the harvest influences the stock size WWF supports some CCMs recommendation of the matching approach to determining Fbased limit reference points that are equivalent to the spawning biomass limit reference points Consequently WWF supports the recommendation of SC9 that the identification of the appropriate values of X for each species in the LRP FXSPR0 be based on an iterative search to match the FXSPR0 with 20SBF0 t1t2 as described by SPC This methodology in part relies on the ability of managers to identify what level of acceptable risk should be applied to breaching a LRP WWF recommends that an acceptable precautionary risk level of exceeding a LRP is represented by a value of 10 or less Once this level of risk has been identified WWF supports the SC9 recommendation that the appropriate values of X for each species in the LRP FXSPR0 be calculated using updated assessments WWF acknowledges the complexity of establishing TRPs given the multiple factors that go into their consideration However while TRPs require additional consideration of socioeconomic considerations current understanding of the biological and socioeconomic conditions does not prevent the implementation of sufficiently precautionary interim TRP at this time WWF encourages the WCPFC to consider and recommend a precautionary interim TRP The interim TRP would serve as an advisory benchmark under which a more refined TRP could be established Most significantly all the necessary information to implement such a benchmark TRP currently exists Lastly WWF supports the SC9 recommendation that the WCPFC consider associated early warning or trigger reference points TrRP which would alert the WCPFC that a stock could be approaching a LRP and that appropriate management action may be required WWF continues to strongly urge the WCPFC and subsidiary bodies to formally endorse and adopt LRP TRP and TrRPs The adoption of explicitly determined LRP and TRP for at least the four key tuna species namely SKJ ALB YFT and BET must be considered an absolute priority for the sustainable management of these important resources in the WCPO WWF recommends that the WCPFC Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF

Limit Reference Points and limiting this to a risk level of 10 or less as a precautionary measure6 Tropical Tunas In December 2012 WCPFC9 adopted CMM 201201 in an attempt to address continuing conservation challenges involving bigeye tuna BET7 The WCPCA bigeye catch for 2012 161679 mt represents the highest since 2004 The high bigeye catch in 2012 coincides with the second highest number of associated sets albeit a 1520 reduction on the record high in 2011 Furthermore the number of purse seine vessels in the tropical fishery reached an alltime high 294 vessels and effort both in terms of days fishing and number of sets was the second highest Even the most optimistic interpretation of these results may be characterised by the word failure Therefore a significant reduction in fishing mortality on BET remains elusive and requires additional measures to reduce the fishing mortality on BET While WWF maintains that the policy choices made by WCPFC9 fail to achieve meaningful conservation of BET we believe that there could be substantial improvements to the understanding of the impact of Fish Aggregating Devices FADs if the SC recommends the aggressive pursuit of improved monitoring surveillance and general research involving FADs While there are ongoing efforts within the SPC and PNA to pursue greater understanding of FAD dynamics we believe that the WCPFC should impose measures in support of FAD research aided by monitoring and surveillance mechanisms which could for instance improve the understanding of the impacts on species composition resulting from FAD typesize Geographic location Drift patterns and prevailing currents Ocean depth and depth of FAD materials Proximity to benthic reliefhydrogeographic features While WWF supports precautionary measures to protect vulnerable stocks like BET WWF also believes that a better understanding of FAD dynamics would help inform the additional and alternative targeted measures that the FFA seeks to implement Lastly WWF strongly supports the efforts of the SPC to analyse the impacts of different levels of reductions in the various fishing sectors WWF encourages all CCMs to carefully review the information and analysis provided by the SPC particularly that contained in Tables 2 and 3 of MI WP018 as they engage in an open and transparent deliberative process to determine where reductions in BET catch must be made The WCPFC absolutely must make effective and enforceable reductions of the catch in all sectors to achieve a meaningful conservation impact for BET Most importantly whatever measures the WCPFC selects absolutely must be subject to strong monitoring control and surveillance measures WWF recommends that the WCPFC Establish and support further research and monitoring of FADs Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF POSITION Engage in an open and transparent deliberative process based on the best available scientific information to determine the level of reductions in BET catch necessary to achieve meaningful BET conservation Revise the current Tropical Tunas CMM to achieve substantial reductions in BET mortality Pacifc Bluefin Tuna This year the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC reported that the stock of North Pacific Bluefin is in extremely poor condition The ISC confirmed that overfishing is occurring the stock is heavily overfished and its spawning stock biomass has declined by as much as 96 WWF maintains strong concerns on rebuilding this ecologically sociologically and economically important fishery resource The WCPFC must recommend that fishing mortality on Pacific bluefin be urgently reduced especially on juveniles in order to reduce the risk of recruitment collapse and allow spawning stock to rebuild If sufficient management measures are not adopted fishing should not be allowed to continue on such a depleted stock WWF recommends that the WCPFC Adopt a longterm Pacific bluefin recovery plan candidate limit and target reference points and harvest control rules that are welldefined preagreed and contain mandatory actions for a determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points Remove all exemptions under the current CMM for Pacific Bluefin tuna through a revised CMM201206 Sharks Many shark species in the WCPO including blue sharks remain subject to high levels of fishing mortality that current stock assessment trends suggest could be unsustainable9 Sharks play a critical role in the WCPO marine ecosystem as apex predators and indicators of ecosystem health10 WWF is concerned with shark conservation and sustainability in the WCPFC region as a whole and considers responsible management trade and consumption where shark mortality occurs in all fishing activities not just in circumstances where tuna fishing is occurring Therefore WCPFC must also recognise the needs of coastal States in the WCPFC region to manage their shark populations WWF recommends the WCPFC impose additional measures proposed during SC9 to ensure that sharks generally are not being adversely impacted in the region but also ensuring that some key shark species are not being substantially depleted Therefore we encourage the WCPFC to recommend precautionary measures to reduce fishing mortality consistent with recommendations made at SC9 drawn from the discussion regarding a proposed integrated shark CMM11 By way of reference we endorse the recommendations contained in sections 41 and 42 of the paper presented by Dr Shelley Clarke at SC9 and TCC9 in addition to measures recommended below12 WWF recommends the WCPFC Develop endorse and adopt a Comprehensive Shark CMM that includes efforts to o Mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs o Implement the recommendations for Bycatch that were endorsed at Kobe III and adopt an annually updated report card system against these recommendations for all of the WCPFC fisheries Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF POSITION o Require

as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Silky Sharks At SC8 in Busan Korea the Scientific Services Provider offered strong scientific evidence that silky sharks are currently overfished and subject to overfishing14 Based on a previous SC recommendation the WCPFC subsequently executed efforts to rebuild spawning biomass of oceanic whitetip sharks by adopting CMM 201104 However SC8 recommended additional analysis for silky sharks due to concerns over data conflict and potential biases in the stock assessment despite basic fishery indicators indicating substantial declines in recent years An updated assessment of silky sharks presented to the SC9 strongly confirmed the previous conclusion that overfishing is occurring and the stock is overfished15 Thus the current science strongly suggests that additional mitigation measures to avoid capture and mortality of silky sharks is warranted16 The WCPFC must take supplementary measures to specifically address the continued adverse impacts on silky sharks in addition to general call for improvements in shark management overall With respect to silky sharks WWF recommends the WCPFC Impose additional mitigation measures and maintain existing measures in an effort to improve the status of the WCPO silky shark stock including o mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs o prohibit the retention transhipment storage onboard sale and landing of silky sharks in all fisheries managed by the WCPFC o mandate the prompt and careful release of any captured silky sharks and o require through data collected from observer programs and other means estimation of the number of releases of silky sharks including the status upon release dead or alive and reporting of this information to the WCPFC Encourage the development of reference points and management for nontarget species including silky sharks as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF POSITION Regional Observer Program Information collected as part of an appropriate observer programme is critically important to the proper management of a fishery Data collected by observers plays a central role in informing fisheries scientists on everything ranging from stock assessments to nontarget species impacts Furthermore observers play an indispensable role in monitoring and enforcing very important conservation and management measures in the WCPO Indeed observers represent the vanguard of fisheries management through the science and service that they provide Consequently observer coverage must be considered a top priority and greater support must be provided to the relevant authority to see that the capacity of the ROP is strengthened The WCPFC must ensure through appropriate guidance that national observer programmes administered under the ROP are fully resourced in terms of human and financial capital as well as governed under appropriate administrative and management structures Within that consideration the WCPFC should endorse an analysis that considers and presents not only a costbenefit analysis of the observer programme in the context of proper management but also different funding models that CCMs could consider for ensuring proper administration and management of the observer program at a national level In any event more attention must be given to the development and full funding of minimum standards that ensure a national programme can perform to ROP standards including such efforts as annual reviews of the national programs under preagreed performance standards Additionally WWF continues to maintain significant concerns regarding the independence of onboard observers from the perspective of data integrity The independence and the security of the observer must be paramount to ensure data integrity Therefore WWF recommends that any observer funding model considered must avoid even the perception of conflict of interest This means establishing a 3rd party payment system that insulates the observer from direct payment by the vessel owner or operator which constitutes an unequivocal financial conflict of interest Specifically WWF believes that a Prepayment Model that would require funding observer placement through an independent 3rd party agent like an escrow account could potentially provide the necessary insulation from undue influence by the vessel owner or operator while also ensuring that the observer is properly paid and transported to their home of record at the conclusion of their service Thus WWF recommends that the WCPFC research funding models that ensure that observer providers can provide timely and secure payments to observers without having those payments made directly to the observer by the vessel owner or operator WWF generally supports current efforts throughout the WCPO in pursuit of Electronic Monitoring EM Other fisheries around the world have demonstrated varying levels of success using EM in limited circumstances depending on the goal of the observation and data collection program Therefore each application of EM is contextual and must be subject to thorough analysis comprehensive testing and careful monitoring to ensure the technology and program is functioning as designed WWF would like to acknowledge the important role that EM could potentially play in ensuring observer coverage throughout the WCPFC CA possibly even at a reduced cost but noting that there will always be a need for human observers to perform certain analytical tasks that a camera sensor or computer simply cannot accomplish WWF recommends that the WCPFC establish a peer review process for the various EM programs in progress or currently planned for implementation in the WCPO Lastly WWF acknowledges and supports the establishment of the Regional Observer Programme Independent Working Group ROPIWG and the continued work toward improving the ROP including consideration of observer health safety and welfare as well as technical data collection issues With respect to the ROP WWF recommends the WCPFC Further implementation of a binding consistent and consolidated set of standards for the ROP Develop an analysis of the observer programme in the context of proper management including an analysis of different funding models Sample Paper Sample Paper Sample Paper WWF Statement to the WCPFC 10th Regular Session Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 WWF POSITION Review and consider for endorsement or adoption the recommendations of the Association for Professional Observers contained in the International Observer Bill of Rights and associated documents17 Catch Documentation Scheme WWF maintains that an efficient and comprehensive catch documentation scheme CDS is a necessary part of a wellmanaged fishery Good catch documentation is essential to proper fisheries management providing the data necessary for analyses as basic as stock assessments to the product traceability that seafood markets are increasingly demanding WWF supports the development and implementation of a comprehensive CDS and supports the establishment of the Catch Documentation Scheme Working Group CDSWG and their efforts toward improving catch documentation and traceability in the WCPFCmanaged fisheries WWF recommends that any CDS considered by the WCPFC must be fully comprehensive to be effective including documentation of all catches landings transfers and trade Other RFMOs provide relevant examples of CDS schemes that were not robust enough to provide adequate documentation For instance the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna CCSBT switched from a purely tradebased scheme to a more comprehensive CDS 
ecause the initial program allowed for substantial overharvest by one of its members resulting from the tradebased scheme not being inclusive of all catches landings and trade Thus any CDS considered by the WCPFC must include all catches landings transfers or trade as part of the framework for the schemes not just the tradebased information With respect to the development of a comprehensive CDS WWF recommends the WCPFC Consider the following elements of a robust CDS system including o A requirement for documentation to accompany all catch harvested landed transhipped traded domestically

WCPFC10-2013-OP05,1,WCPFC10 Tenth Regular Session nd December 6th December 2013 Cairns AUSTRALIA OCEAN FAD REPORT ON COASTAL TROLL FISHERIES ABOARD OCEAN JOY WCPFC102013OP05 December 2013
WCPFC10-2013-OP05,2,Ocean FAD Report on Coastal Albacore Troll Fishery aboard FV OCEAN JOY 2013
WCPFC10-2013-OP05,3,For the past 12 years IUU driftnet vessels have been targeting on North Pacific Albacore These are the same tuna stocks that are caught by US and Canadian West Coast artesian Albacore Troll and Pole fishers This fish proves it
WCPFC10-2013-OP05,4,Albacore tuna is a migratory species that travel from the coast of Japan to the US and Canadian west coast seasonally IUU driftnet fishing conducted in the north western Pacific Ocean stops this migratory pattern not only for the albacore but for all sea creatures such as dolphins turtles and whales Why is there is no protection
WCPFC10-2013-OP05,5,July 13 2013 FV Ocean Joy departed Monterey Bay setting out for the Albacore fishing grounds Aboard is Captain JohnBoy Harder and new observer and crewmember Kristy Faure who is taking photos and documenting our season July 24 2013 Our position is approximately 4438 North12555 West Around 80 miles west of Newport Oregon which just happens to be the new HQ of NOAA By this time we have observed that two out of ten fish brought aboard have marks or scratches made by driftnets
WCPFC10-2013-OP05,6,August 28th we returned to Westport for unloading and crew change We returned to the sea on September 1st and headed south again This time all the way to Eureka Northern CA We found driftnet scratched fish there too 4035 N x 12532 W on the 4th of September
WCPFC10-2013-OP05,7,On September 6th we headed north all the way into Canadian waters By September 15th we found ourselves off of Vancouver Island and caught this fish with gill net imbedded in its body Everywhere we fished we had a sign of IUU driftnet activity
WCPFC10-2013-OP05,8,In conclusion IUU driftnet fishing continues to target albacore tuna in competition with local west coast sustainable Troll Pole fisheries Enforcement agencies could stop this illegal fishing anytime but choose not to act
WCPFC10-2013-OP05,9,Recommendations to the WCPFC10 Required VMS on all fishing vessels in the WCPFC exempt area north of 20N west of 175E as agreed upon at NC8 starting on January 1st2014 Ban all transshipping for Long Line vessels If transshipping continues mandatory observer coverage on both LL vessels and carrier ships Any vessel caught fishing or transshipping out of compliance be put on IUU list with no exceptions Heavy fines for IUU vessel owners flag states
WCPFC10-2013-OP05,10,High Seas Driftnets were to be banned by the United Nations in 1993 Why they still thrive today can only be on account of greed

WCPFC10-2013-OP06,3,The International Game Fish Association IGFA is a nonprofit organization that represents recreational anglers throughout the world IGFA was established in 1939 has active members in over 100 countries is the governing body for international recreational fishing and provides rules for ethical angling practices Many of IGFAs members target the highly migratory species managed by WCPFC especially marlin sailfish and spearfish ie billfish which are primarily caught and released
WCPFC10-2013-OP06,4,IGFA has great concern about how highly migratory species are being managed on a global level for recreational anglers The lack of data and accurate reporting on billfish catch is of particular concern As an organization that is committed to the conservation of game fishes IGFA has deployed 81 popup satellite archival tags in marlin and sailfish around the world in the last two years 51 of which have been in waters under this organizations purview The information gained from this exercise is available to your scientific committee via our website at httpigmrigfaorg
WCPFC10-2013-OP06,5,The following are IGFAs recommendations for the 10th Regular Session of the WCPFC
WCPFC10-2013-OP06,6,Billfish Although primarily a commercial bycatch species billfish are highly sought after recreational species that are primarily caught and released We urge the WCPFC to manage all billfish at higher abundance levels than MSY for recreational anglers The WCNPO stock of striped marlin is overfished and experiencing overfishing Reducing fishing mortality would likely increase spawning stock biomass and may improve the chances of higher recruitment We recommend fishing at a constant catch of 2500 mt that would lead to potential increases in spawning biomass of 133 to 223 by 2017 Although not currently overfished or experiencing overfishing we recommend that fishing mortality not be increased for blue marlin so that the stock can rebound to levels in excess of MSY No formal stock assessments exist for sailfish and black marlin Better data collection is necessary for these species so that their true abundance can be accurately estimated IGFA further recommends implementing a prohibition on Pacific billfish entering into international trade Similar legislation has recently been passed at the request of IGFA in the United States that now bans importation of marlin sailfish and spearfish into the continental United States We also recommend all countries be required to report dead discards and use circle hooks in their longline fisheries
WCPFC10-2013-OP06,7,Tuna The latest stock assessment indicates that Pacific bluefin tuna have been reduced to only 36 of their virgin biomass necessitating the following actions
WCPFC10-2013-OP06,8,Adopt a rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin tuna that will return the population to 25SSBrecentF0 within the next 10 years Establish a quota that includes all sources of Pacific bluefin tuna mortality including artisanal fisheries and bycatch Establish allocation keys so that each member has a specific quota under which to manage its fishery Reduce the catch of juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna by adopting a minimum size limit that will prevent
WCPFC10-2013-OP06,9,The International Game Fish Association is a notforprofit organization committed to the conservation of game fish and the promotion of responsible ethical angling practices through science education rule making and record keeping Email HQigfaorg Website wwwigfaorg
WCPFC10-2013-OP06,10,overfishing of all age classes and allow more fish to reach maturity and contribute to the next generation Implement an effective monitoring program and enforcement process with 100 observer coverage If effective management measures for catch reductions are not adopted in 2013 direct commercial Pacific bluefin fisheries should be banned until these measures are put in place
WCPFC10-2013-OP06,11,Bigeye tuna is currently overfished IGFA recommends the following actions
WCPFC10-2013-OP06,12,Longline catch limits should be set at levels low enough to result in a real reduction in fishing mortality Eliminate the use of FADs in the purse seine bigeye fishery Establish fisheryspecific quotas for bigeye tuna
WCPFC10-2013-OP06,13,Sharks IGFA recommends that WPCFC prohibit the removal of shark fins at sea to improve the enforcement of the shark finning ban We recommend banning wire traces on all longlines
WCPFC10-2013-OP06,14,IUU IGFA recommends that WPCFC strengthen the controls against illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing
WCPFC10-2013-OP06,15,General Recreational angling is an established and important economic entity in developed countries and a growing sector in many developing nations As such we ask that WCPFC recognize both its relevance and that it may necessitate alternate management objectives than those used in commercial fisheries IGFA kindly offers its consultation to WCPFC on recreational fisheries issues
WCPFC10-2013-OP06,16,Managing fisheries on the basis of MSY is an excessively riskprone approach As such we suggest that WCPFC adopt a target objective below MSY to compensate for biological environmental and data uncertainties Many recreational fisheries are catch and release in nature where anglers prefer to catch more and bigger fish rather than to harvest fish Managing stocks on the level of MSY not only reduces the abundance of fish but also their average size Maintaining stocks at higher abundances also benefits recreational anglers that release their fish and contributes to the substantial economic value of these fisheries We feel this is especially true with bycatch species such as marlin and sailfish that have little commercial value but great economic value to recreational anglers
WCPFC10-2013-OP06,17,The prevalence and importance of artisanal fisheries within the WCPFCs purview must be taken into consideration Better catch data from these fisheries is necessary to evaluate their impact on HMS fisheries
WCPFC10-2013-OP08,1,COMMISSION Tenth Regular Sessionth December 6th December 2013 Cairns AUSTRALIA STATEMENT OF CITES SECRETARIAT WCPFC102013OP0805122013 1th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC Cairns Australia 26 December 2013 Statement by the CITES Secretariat On behalf of the SecretaryGeneral of CITES John Scanlon we would like to sincerely thank you Mr Chairman for giving us the floor and express our gratitude to the Government of Australia for hosting this 10th Regular Session of WCPFC in Cairns The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora CITES is a legally binding international agreement between 179 countries including many members cooperating nonmembers and participating territories to this Commission The interaction of CITES with regional fisheries management organizations such as WCPFC has taken on new significance with the CITES listing of several shark species that fall under the purview of the Commission At the 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES CoP16 in Bangkok in March 2013 and because they met specific trade and biological listing criteria Porbeagle shark Lamna nasus Oceanic whitetip shark Carcharhinus longimanus Scalloped hammerhead shark Sphyrna lewini Great hammerhead shark S mokarran and Smooth hammerhead shark S zygaena as well as all manta rays Manta spp were included in CITES Appendix II meaning that international trade is strictly regulated and controlled to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival but is not prohibited The entry into effect of these listings has been delayed by 18 months until 14 September to enable CITES Parties to resolve technical and administrative issues related to their implementation From 14 September 2014 onward any international trade in specimens of these species will need to be accompanied by CITES permits and certificates confirming that they have been harvested sustainably and legally and this trade will also need to be reported to the CITES Secretariat The collaboration between CITES authorities and fishery agencies at national and regional levels will be essential for the effective implementation of these requirements and this will need to get assistance where required National and regional fishery management agencies and organizations have the main responsibility for managing fishery resources including sharks and rays CITES as a global instrument for regulating international trade in listed wild species can complement fishery management to encourage fishery stakeholders managers and fishers alike to implement and follow sustainable and legal fishing practices for international commercial trade Good fishery management measures based on the best scientific information available play a major role in the implementation of CITES requirements for international trade in commerciallyexploited aquatic species To effectively implement the CITES CoP16 decisions for the 5 sharks and the manta rays the involvement of and support for a widerange of stakeholders will be needed The response to this challenge has been remarkable with a flurry of activities being put in place since March 2013 for which we are particularly grateful Just to name a few Australia and New Zealand Brazil China and Germany as well as several NGOs are planning regional capacity building workshops dealing with specific aspects of the CITES shark listings identification 2 materials are being developed targeted needs assessments are being made guidelines to determine that proposed trade levels are sustainable are being established and the European Union and the USA amongst others have pledged financial support for assisting these and other efforts The CITES Secretariat is also committed to assist CITES Parties especially developing countries in being able to comply with the CITES requirements by 14 September 2014 The European Union has generously provided 12 million Euro to the CITES Secretariat to enhance the implementation of the legally binding CITES regulatory measures for sharks We are closely cooperating with the FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department in this initiative Our joint actions are aimed at enhancing the efforts of regional fisheries management organizations and at developing countries that are key shark fishing nations which need to strengthen their scientific institutional or enforcement capacities This initiative also involves outreach and communication The Secretariat has just launched a dedicated webpage on sharks and CITES with comprehensive and up to date information on a broad range of range of issues such as the CITESFAO collaboration and access to capacity building tools The webpage is a work in progress and will be further developed over time We invite you to visit it through our Homepage at wwwcitesorg and will be happy to provide further assistance and help if and when required Finally Mr Chairman the CITES Secretariat would greatly appreciate if this Commission could consider at one of its future meetings a dedicated discussion on how WCPFC and CITES could collaborate on issues and species of common interest including the sharks just mentioned We would be very willing to work together with the WCPFC secretariat and the members of the Convention in this regard Thank you for your attention

WCPFC10-2013-OP09,5,Exploration and Development of the Fishery
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,6,Starting in the mid1980s the American Fishermens Research Foundation a c3 corporation funded by the harvester processor and supplier members of the Western Fishboat Owners Association joined with the US Governments Pacific Fisheries Development Foundation to explore and expand the troll fishery for South Pacific albacore1 The total budget for the first phase was 287800 the federal share 115000 and the AFRFs share 172800 The project was to send two to four albacore troll vessels 6080 feet in length with crews of 2 to 4 to the South Pacific to develop a US albacore fishery and to do albacore tagging The US vessels in cooperation with New Zealand were given permission by Dr Robin Allen then with the New Zealand Government to enter the New Zealand EEZ in the area near Chatham Island New Zealand thought obtaining data from the US cruises would be a good idea since
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,7,our knowledge of albacore distribution and commercial potential along the east coast is poor these vessels would provide valuable data for expanding NZ albacore fishing and an opportunity to see innovations used in the North Pacific high seas albacore trolling fishery2
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,8,During February and March of 1986 two troll vessels sometimes accompanied by NOAAs research vessel the Townsend Cromwell fished in waters between 38 and 41 S and 140 to 155 W and caught 100mt of albacore while tagging 702 albacore
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,9,A second phase of the 3 year project followed with the US supplying 360000 and AFRF supplying 180000 for a total of over a half a million dollars to send 6 US troll vessels to fish for albacore during December 1986 to April of Eventually 40 troll vessels went fishing in the area catching 4000 mt in the 1987 to 1988 season while tagging 1247 albacore
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,10,At that time most of the current members of the American Albacore Fishing Association were members of WFOA Memorandum of 4 Dec 1986 Talbot Murray to Dr Robin Allen and Tom Norris Page 3 of 6
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,11,A third phase was conducted in December 1988 to April 1989 at an additional cost of 129000 with the US government and AFRF again sharing the costs This part of the project was to send 40 albacore troll vessels to tag 2000 albacore in the South Pacific fishing area
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,12,The thrust of this effort was to develop a fishery which could deliver to the two canneries in American Samoa Canneries in California and Hawaii had been closed Also in 1988 there had been a large influx of Asian drift gillnet vessels taking albacore in the North and South Pacific A log book sheet attached to one of the reports from the 19881989 season had the entry that Because of gilnet sic damage we are tagging small fish to get the quality of fish you specified of the fish we are catching are gilnet sic marked 3
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,13,The US fleet was not alone in its efforts which resulted in the tagging of 783 albacore between 1986 and 1989 In cooperation with AFRF New Zealand tagged 1866 albacore and French Polynesia tagged 190 The New Zealand tagging occurred near shore on the west and east coast of the North Island The US tagging occurred between 170 and 140 W and 38to 41 S4
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,14,Historic Catch and Level of Effort
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,15,The US troll fleet for South Pacific albacore flourished from about 1987 through 2000 The fleet declined in the last several years primarily because of higher insurance and fuel costs and the reduction of cannery demand for troll caught fish in American Samoa until recently In addition some of the carrier vessels used by the fleet to transship to American Samoa have been taken out of service During that time the canneries in American Samoa came to depend on foreign longline fleets for their source of albacore As can be seen from the chart below this fishery developed by the US was once a 5000 mt fishery employing over 50 vessels

WCPFC10-2013-OP09,20,These figures come from the Pacific Fishery Management Councils September 2011 SAFE report and for whatever reason are slightly different from the figures reflected in WCPFCSC92013GNIP04 and WCPFCSC92013GNIP04 Figures on number of vessels and trips were not immediately available for 2011 and 2012 Page 5 of 6
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,21,and fresh frozen troll caught albacore all suggest that this US developed South Pacific albacore fishery can be very important to the US in the future
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,22,No Scientific Evidence That The Troll Fishery Has Impact On The Stock
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,23,Scientific papers from the SPC and the WCPFCSC have repeatedly testified to the health of the South Pacific albacore stock See WCPFC92012IP
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,24,AFRF Closing Statement From WCPFC9
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,25,It might be appropriate to repeat part of the AFRF Closing Statement in December of 2012
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,26,As we have repeatedly indicated during informal discussions at these WCPFC meetings the US albacore troll fleet is very concerned as is TE Vaka Moana and the FFA about the large increase in longline effort
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,27,Longline catches of South Pacific albacore have risen dramatically in recent years and we as others are disappointed that the Commission has not agreed upon conservation and management measures to protect this important resource
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,28,Nevertheless it is prudent to repeat as the most recent scientific studies before this Commission have proven there is no scientific evidence nor was there when 200503 was accepted by the Commission that the South Pacific albacore troll fishery has had or is having any adverse impact on the stocks Nor has the effort in that fishery increased The SPC the SC and the IATTC have all concluding that the South Pacific albacore stocks are above MSY With no scientific basis to limit the effect of the US troll fishery the Commission should not agree to amending CMM 200503 or its replacement CCM 20105 in any way that would inhibit the high seas US troll fleet
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,29,It should also be remembered that as long ago as 2005 and carried through to the current CCM on South Pacific albacore the Commission is required to annually review the measure based on Page 6 of 6
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,30,sound scientific advice7 We look forward to working with our South Pacific friend and neighbors in crafting a scientifically based and effectively enforced measure to be approved at WCPFC10
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,31,Current AFRF and AAFA Position
WCPFC10-2013-OP09,32,The position of the US South Pacific albacore troll harvesters remains firm There is no scientific or economic basis to close the high seas to the South Pacific albacore troll fishery This fishery occurs entirely outside of any of the Pacific Island Countries EEZs

WCPFC11-2014-OP01,4,ISSF POSITION STATEMENT Presented during the 11th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission in Apia Samoa 1 5 December 2014 For further information please visit httpwwwISSFOUNDATIONorg CMM 201301 bigeye and skipjack tuna The analyses presented at SC10 corroborate the fact that CMMs adopted by WCPFC to end the overfishing of bigeye have been ineffective Overfishing continues and the stock is now below the Limit Reference Point adopted by the Commission The purse seine fishery continues to increase with record catches in 2013 when the bigeye catch by this gear was clearly the highest ever In addition the longline fishery has a similar impact on the reproductive capacity of the stock as the purse seine fishery does Overall fishing mortality on the stock needs to be reduced by 36 in order to end overfishing CMM201301 is overly complex and has too many exemptions and optional clauses which render it ineffective and difficult to enforce The WCPFC could consider adding other incremental measures to the CMM such as extending the FAD closure period limiting the number of FAD sets made each year or the number of FADs that each vessel uses but this is what has been done since 2009 and it is clearly not effective ISSF urges the WCPFC to eliminate the exemptions in the CMM and to adopt management measures that are effective and easier to enforce such as a total fishery closure potentially with two closure periods or a reduction in fishing effort to meet the objective of ending the overfishing of the bigeye stock Regarding skipjack tuna the stock is within the range of the candidate Target Reference Points TRP being considered by WCPFC and SC10 recommended that fishing mortality on the stock not be allowed to increase from its current level ISSF urges WCPFC to limit fishing effort fishing days in the purse seine fishery to a lower level that will maintain skipjack within the range of candidate TRPs and significantly reduce the catch of bigeye Harvest Control Rules HCRs and Reference Points HCRs are a set of welldefined management actions to be taken in response to changes in stock status with respect to target and limit reference points ISSF endorses the application of the Precautionary Approach using clear target and limit reference points and HCRs as called for by the UN Fish Stocks Agreement and by some RFMO Conventions In 2012 the WCPFC adopted limit reference points for skipjack bigeye yellowfin and South Pacific albacore This was an important first step Now the WCPFC needs to adopt harvest strategies including target reference points and harvest control rules for these same stocks ISSF looks forward to substantial progress on adoption of target reference points and HCRs for skipjack at WCPFC11 through the adoption of the proposed work plan for the development and implementation of target reference points and HCRs Compliance and Data Gaps ISSF notes with concern the SC10 information about the lack of operational data for longline fleets in the high seas which affected the quality of the bigeye assessment reported at SC10 ISSF strongly urges all CCMs to meet their obligations regarding data submissions and provide these operational data to the SPC by the agreed deadlines and in the correct formats ISSF further urges the Commission to consider appropriate responses to promote compliance by those CCMs who have not yet provided operational catch and effort data While there were important strides in 2013 ISSF continues to be concerned with the lack of transparency in the WCPFC Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS In contrast to the other four tuna RFMOs observers are not allowed in the CMS working group meetings and the responses of members to identified noncompliance are not released publically Member reports on the implementation of WCPFC measures known as Part II reports are also confidential ISSF urges the Commission to endorse TCC10s recommendation to amend CMM 201302 to reform its CMS process so that accredited observers may attend the working group meetings and information on how CCMs respond to and plan to address the areas of identified non compliance be made public ISSF also supports the development of a scheme of responses to noncompliance by the Commission as soon as possible Fish Aggregating Device FAD Management Setting on FADs accounts for nearly 40 of global tuna catches and 50 of global skipjack catches FADs are one of the most important fishing methods for tropical tunas However there are huge gaps in all TRFMOs regarding the number of FADs being used and on details of fishing operations on individual FADs Observer programs can be used to collect much but not all of the information needed to appropriately monitor FADs as shown in WCPFCSC102014STIP09 The WCPFC has adopted Minimum Standard Data Fields for observers that contain much of this information However there are some types of information that an observer is unlikely or unable to collect such as FAD markings or details on the FAD design This is information that vessel captains can easily collect but observers cannot do so routinely ISSF urges the WCPFC to take two actions this year 1 ensure that the regional observer program routinely collects the FAD data in the WCPFC Minimum Standard Fields and 2 expand the information required from vessels to include data on FAD deployments designs equipment and identification marks ISSF strongly supports the SC10 and TCC10 recommendations for the creation of a Working Group on FAD management ISSF urges the Working Group to adopt Terms of Reference that address i FAD marking and identification and use of electronic signatures and ii FAD monitoring tracking and control Transparency in Access Joint Venture and Chartering Arrangements ISSF recognizes the importance of access and chartering or joint venture arrangements to the development aspirations of developing States in particular small island developing States It is also equally important for accurate stock assessments and effective compliance and enforcement that there is clarity regarding catch attribution and the responsible party for MCS regarding vessels under chartering or access arrangements ISSF urges the WCPFC to adopt measures to promote transparency in access agreements and chartering or joint venture arrangements that are similar to existing IOTC and ICCAT measures Sharks SC10 recommended that WCPFC11 consider a number of longline shark mitigation methods WCPFCSC10EBWP01 ISSF notes that shark lines are used in many fisheries and these catch mostly silky and oceanic whitetip sharks Since the retention of these species is prohibited ISSF urges WCPFC to prohibit the use of shark lines in order to improve compliance ISSF is encouraged that FFA USA and the EU are seeking the adoption of a comprehensive and robust shark conservation and management measures that includes the removal of the fintoweight ratio which was highlighted at TCC10 as being an area of noncompliance ISSF supports amending CMM 201007 to mandate that fins remain naturally attached for all sharks landed Moreover the CMM should include the implementation of a range of proven shark catch mitigation measures improved data collection and reporting and the development of stockspecific reference points Longlining and Transshipment ISSF notes with concern the low levels of observer coverage data indicates that coverage rates may be less than the required 5 and the failure of some CCMs to provide the required transshipment reports or advance notifications ISSF notes that electronic monitoring systems are being tested and developed which could potentially be used to address some of these problems ISSF urges WCPFC11 to impose and enforce as a precautionary measure measures to limit longliner capacity in the Convention Area ISSF also urges the Commission to task its scientific body to make recommendations to WCPFC12 regarding the levels of longline capacity consistent with sustainable exploitation and prudent management of target tuna stocks ISSF further urges the Commission to amend its transshipment measure CMM 06 in order to address these significant gaps in its effectiveness which affect traceability of the products and could result in IUU fishing Closed Vessel Registries and Management of Fleet Capacity Experts agree that there is overcapacity in the global tuna fleets Fishing fleet overcapacity increases pressure to weaken management measures and eventually leads to stock overexploitation ISSF continues to be concerned with the growth of fishing capacity in the WCPO region which has not been curtailed through the provisions adopted in CMM 201301 To underscore this importance of this issue in October ISSF clarified its Resolution to Limit the Growth in Fishing Capacity of the Global LargeScale Tropical Tuna Purse Seine Fleet Through this Resolution ISSF Participating Companies must refrain from transactions in skipjack bigeye and yellowfin tuna caught by large scale1 purse seine vessels that are not actively fishing for tuna or under contract for construction as of December 31 2012 or a replacement for an existing vessel ISSF urges the WCPFC to establish limited entry through closed vessel registries and to develop a common currency to measure fishing capacity such as cubic meters of well volume ISSF also supports the Kobe III call for creating mechanisms to transfer capacity to developing countries These steps should be taken now since scaling back purse seine fleet capacity will become even more difficult as new vessels are introduced Given the importance of a mechanism to transfer capacity to developing countries to any regional capacity management scheme ISSF hosted a Workshop in March 2014 to start a For the purpose of this resolution largescale purse seine vessels are those at least 335 m3 fish hold volume dialogue on this issue ISSF hopes this Workshop and dialog will contribute to progressing capacity management in the tuna RFMOs The workshop report can be accessed here

WCPFC11-2014-OP10,2,COMMISSION ELEVENTH REGULAR SESSION Faleata Sports Complex Apia SAMOA 5 December 2014 WWF WCPFC11 Position Statement 2014 WCPFC112014OP10 November 2014 Paper by WWF th Regular Session of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC Apia Samoa December 15 2014
WCPFC11-2014-OP10,3,The World Wide Fund for Nature WWF would like to again thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC for the opportunity to attend the 11th Regular Session as an observer and to address the critically important role that it plays in the proper management of the Western Central Pacific Ocean WCPO fisheries WWF once again calls on members of the WCPFC to address the issues and recommendations raised at SC10 TCC10 and WCPFC10 as well as observe the experience of other RFMOs in their own efforts to achieve and maintain improved measures for monitoring and surveillance WWF wishes to reiterate its position offered in Cairns in December 2013 WCPFC10 and taking into account the WCPFCrelated meetings held since the recommendations listed below as well as other documents submitted to the WCPFC for review as Observer Papers WWF remains supportive of the work of the WCPFC and subsidiary bodies in pursuing the implementation of Reference Points RP Harvest Control Rules HCR and Harvest Strategies HS Consistent with previous WWF position statements and recommendations WWF encourages the WCPFC11 to develop and implement the adoption of explicit Limit and Target Reference Points LRPTRP HCRs and HSs for all WCPO fishery stocks under WCPFC authority Therefore WWF welcomes the proposal by Australia for a CMM on establishing a harvest strategy for key tuna species in the WCPO We support the approach that the draft CMM will seek the Commissions agreement to formally develop a HS approach to fisheries for the major tuna stocks under the Commissions purview with a goal toward achieving individual harvest strategies for specific fisheries developed in accordance with this CMM that in turn set out the management actions necessary to achieve defined biological economic and social objectives for each fishery If WCPFC11 takes appropriate action on this CMM it will provide a sufficient framework for moving forward management in a methodical way to result in valid and effective LTRPs and HCRs WWF strongly commends the initiative of the PNA to establish and implement a TRP for the SKJ stock in PNA waters WWF also supports Japans development of an alternative CMM for an SKJ TRP Gregg Yan WWF WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 11th Regular Session Apia Samoa 15 December 2014 recently presented for review by the WCPFC Both proposals present valuable perspectives and strong commitments to sustainability and precaution We encourage a robust discussion about the proposed levels for the TRPs in the different proposals and upon compromising and selecting a candidate TRP at this meeting support the application of that TRP throughout the WCPO Lastly WWF notes the SC10 and TCC10 support for the analyses of these important management measures as well as their recommendation that WCPFC11 take the results of the papers presented at this meeting into consideration when considering the adoption of TRPs and HCRs for the key target species WWF recommends that the WCPFC Adopt and implement the proposed CMM on Establishing a Harvest Strategy for Key Tuna Species in the WCPO Adopt and Implement a CMM consistent with proposed recommendations on a TRP for Skipjack Tuna at a level of 050SSBF0t1t2 or higher Support the continued development and implementation of LRPs and TRPs as a priority for proper management of all stocks Support interim precautionary TRPs as a benchmark for further consideration by the WCPFC in 2014 and Support the continued development and implementation of HCRs that ensure the transparent and efficient management of stocks in relation to LRPs and TRPs Many shark species in the WCPO remain subject to high levels of fishing mortality that current stock assessment trends suggest could be unsustainable Sharks play a critical role in the WCPO marine ecosystem as apex predators and indicators of ecosystem health WWF is concerned with shark conservation and sustainability in the WCPFC region as a whole and considers responsible management trade and consumption where shark mortality occurs in all fishing activities not just in circumstances where tuna fishing is occurring Therefore WCPFC must also recognise the needs of coastal States in the WCPFC region to manage their shark populations WWF recommends the WCPFC adopt and implement measures proposed during 2013 to ensure that sharks stocks are not adversely impacted in the region while also ensuring that some key shark species are not being substantially depleted Therefore we encourage the WCPFC to adopt precautionary measures to reduce fishing mortality consistent with recommendations made previously by the SC and drawn from the discussion regarding a proposed integrated shark CMM By way of reference we again endorse the recommendations contained in sections 41 and 42 of the paper presented by Dr Shelley Clarke to the WCPFC in 2013 in addition to measures recommended below WWF recommends the WCPFC Adopt and implement a Comprehensive Shark CMM that includes efforts to o Mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs o Implement the recommendations for bycatch that were endorsed at Kobe III and adopt an annually updated report card system against these recommendations for all of the WCPFC fisheries o Require through data collected from observer programs and other means estimation of the number of captures and releases of all sharks and rays including the status upon release dead or alive and reporting of this information to the WCPFC o Require through observers programs recording what gear is used in longline activities including the use of wire traces and any multi monofilament traces in order to avoid biteoff by sharks WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 11th Regular Session Apia Samoa 15 December 2014 o Introduce a scheme to document the capture and trade of sharks whereby it allows for traceability through to the final market state and o Ensure the implementation requirements for CITES listed sharks are fully understood and planned for in preparation for CITES Parties and Non Parties trading with CITES Parties needing to make Nondetriment Sustainability and legal findings in order to issue export permits for trade in these species by September 2014 Where WCPFC members make nondetriment findings for shark species they should share with the WCPFC details of the basis of those findings Encourage the development of reference points and management for nontarget species including all shark species as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Encourage CCMs to report all shark catches from domestic fleets operating in territorial and archipelagic waters In December 2013 WCPFC10 adopted yet another measure CMM 201301 in an attempt to address continuing conservation challenges involving bigeye tuna BET The WCPCA bigeye catch for 2013 158662 mt was only slightly lower than in 2012 The provisional purse seine catch estimate for bigeye tuna for 2013 82151 mt was the highest on record The record high bigeye tuna catch in 2013 coincides with a continuation of high effort levels and elevated bigeye tuna catch rates for all set types The number of purse seine vessels in the tropical fishery remains at an alltime high 297 vessels and total effort in terms of fishing days estimated from logbook data and VMS data was also highest Fishing mortality is currently 157 times that which will support the maximum sustained yield As a result the BET stock is now at 16 of its historic biomass and is experiencing overfishing and overfished Once again even the most optimistic interpretation of these results may be characterised by the word failure While WWF maintains that the policy choices made repeatedly by the WCPFC fail to achieve meaningful conservation of BET we believe that there could be substantial improvements to the understanding of the impact of Fish Aggregating Devices FADs through the aggressive pursuit of improved monitoring surveillance and general research involving FADs followed by appropriately targeted limits or management measures While there are ongoing efforts within the SPC and PNA to pursue greater understanding of FAD dynamics we believe that the WCPFC should impose measures in support of FAD research aided by monitoring and surveillance mechanisms which could for instance improve the understanding of the impacts on species composition resulting from FAD typesize Geographic location Drift patterns and prevailing currents Ocean depth and depth of FAD materials Proximity to benthic reliefhydrogeographic features The WCPFC absolutely must make effective and enforceable reductions of the catch in all sectors to achieve a meaningful conservation impact for BET Most importantly whatever measures the WCPFC selects absolutely must be subject to strong monitoring control and surveillance measures WWF recommends that the WCPFC Establish and support further research and monitoring of FADs Engage in an open and transparent deliberative process based on the best available scientific information to determine the level of reductions in BET catch necessary to achieve meaningful BET conservation Revise the current Tropical Tunas CMM to achieve substantial reductions in BET mortality WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 11th Regular Session Apia Samoa 15 December 2014 Technical reports of both the ISC and the IATTC indicate that the North Pacific Bluefin tuna stock is in extremely poor condition The ISC confirmed that overfishing is occurring the stock is heavily overfished and its spawning stock biomass has declined by as much as 96 This is a clear indicator that the management measures taken both in the Western and Central Pacific and in the Eastern Pacific are proving insufficient to conserve the biological integrity of this stock The IATTC and WCPFC must assume their share of responsibility WWF maintains strong concerns regarding this stock with an aim of restoring and rebuilding this ecologically sociologically and economically important fishery resource The current science strongly indicates that there is only one reproductive cohort that is reaching the end of its life Additionally about 90 of the stock fished are young fish that have not yet reproduced Thus the continued reproductive success of the entire stock depends on the reproductive success of a single cohort leaving the stock in a critical situation that may seriously jeopardize recruitment If the WCPFC fails to adopt sufficient management measures the stock will be subject to potential collapse Should the WCPFC fail to adopt sufficient management measures that are consistent with scientific advice the fishery could ultimately be subject to more draconian management measures such as extended closed seasons and areas until such time that managers can prepare a rigorous and scientifically defensible recovery plan The WCPFC consistent with the best scientific information must adopt and implement measures that urgently reduce fishing mortality on Pacific bluefin tuna especially on juveniles in order to reduce the risk of recruitment collapse and allow spawning stock to rebuild If sufficient management measures cannot be agreed the WCPFC must recommend that fishing should not be allowed to continue on such a depleted stock WWF recommends that the WCPFC Adopt the CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURE TO ESTABLISH A MULTIANNUAL REBUILDING PLAN FOR PACIFIC BLUEFIN TUNA agreed by NC10 and recommend to WCPFC11 Adopt a longterm Pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan candidate limit and target reference points and harvest control rules that are welldefined preagreed and contain mandatory actions for a determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points in 2015

WCPFC11-2014-OP11,3,Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Eleventh Regular Session of the Commission Apia Samoa 1 5 December 2014
WCPFC11-2014-OP11,4,Summary Greenpeace welcomes the opportunity to attend the 11th meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC as an observer The outcome of the recent WCPFC Science Committee meeting in particular the poor state of bigeye and Pacific bluefin stocks is the predictable result of the failure of members of this Commission to uphold the mandate stipulated under Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention to apply the precautionary approach including through acting upon the best available scientific advice in adopting conservation and management measures CMMs for key tuna species1 The overfishing occurring on these critical tuna stocks is a direct result of the continued expansion of fishing fleets increasing fishing capacity and effort through the use of FADs in particular and increasing noncompliance Two of the Pacifics vital tuna stocks are now at dangerously low levels the Pacific bluefin tuna population is estimated to be at 43 and bigeye tuna at 16 of its original spawning biomass2 The Commission must prioritise efforts towards rebuilding these stocks While the other tuna species skipjack yellowfin and albacore are at somewhat higher biomass levels there are warning signs that all three of these stocks are also in trouble from observed localised depletion or range contraction of skipjack and yellowfin to widespread economic deterioration of domestic fisheries for South Pacific albacore The commission cant afford to be the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff and must develop precautionary targets and harvest control rules to restore all the fisheries in its mandate to full health and productivity Greenpeace therefore calls on the members of the WCPFC to urgently adopt the following measures Ensure full compliance with data provision requirements as a fundamental basis for the work of the Commission and agree on decreased fishing opportunities in 2015 for those parties failing to comply with these provisions Greenpeace welcomes the FFA proposal for a Conservation and Management Measure for the Provision of Operational Level Data by all CCMs and hopes that WCPFC parties will go further and act strongly on this fundamental issue Greenpeace urges China Japan Korea and Taiwan to remedy their noncompliance on this issue Adopt interim target reference points TRPs of 50 SBF0 for skipjack bigeye and yellowfin and 70 for albacore until final TRPs are agreed by the Commission no later than 2017 Greenpeace supports the FFA proposed replacement for the conservation and management measure on establishing a harvest strategy for key tuna species in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean

WCPFC11-2014-OP11,7,Violation of the convention nonprovision of operational level data Commission members agreed 10 years ago to cooperate including through the provision of necessary data as an obligation to being a party to the Convention To date four CCMs namely China Japan Korea and Taiwan continue to withhold data on the operations of their fleets in the high seas This is an unacceptable situation that undermines the work of the scientific community and the credibility of management advice made available to the Commission and thwarts efforts to combat IUU fishing In summary it makes a mockery of this Commission This is a serious breach in the obligations of CCMs as stipulated under article 5b article 5i of the Convention The first meeting of the Scientific Committee of the Commission in 2005 concluded that access to operational level data was absolutely necessary to interpret historical changes in the longline fishery and recommended data rules including standards for operational data that were adopted by WCPFC2 CCMs have now had nine years in which to address any domestic legal constraints to apply these measures and there is simply no plausible excuse for any CCM that has failed to do so The Commission must ensure full compliance with data provision requirements as a fundamental basis for its work and agree on decreased fishing opportunities in 2015 for those parties failing to comply with these provisions Article 20 of the Convention gives guidance to the Commission exercising its decisionmaking provisions in order to improve CCM compliance Article 10 Paragraph 3 e of the Convention requires the Commission to take into account data provision by CCMs in determining criteria for the allocation of TACs or TAEs The Commission should also look at the option of imposing mandatory regional observer coverage as a mitigating measure to gather the necessary operational data Greenpeace supports the adoption of the FFA proposal for a Conservation and Management Measure for the Provision of Operational Data Target Reference Points and Harvest Control Rules The Commission agreed to use a hierarchical 3level framework to define appropriate limit reference points LRPs for stocks based on the level of biological information available For skipjack albacore yellowfin and bigeye tunas and striped marlin the current agreed biomass limit reference point is 20 SBF0 based on recruitment conditions for the most recent 10 years of assessment excluding the final year of assessment when recruitment is poorly estimated The Commission has also since decided not to adopt an equivalent Fbased reference point as this was seen as redundant given the adoption of a biomassbased LRP The continued failure of current CMMs to address the issue of increasing capacity and declining stocks adds urgency to the need to adopt TRPs and harvest control rules These TRPs must ensure at a minimum a low risk of stocks dropping below the biomass LRPs The majority of CCMs at SC8 recommended that the low risk level for stocks dropping above these LRPs should be 10 for yellowfin and bigeye and 5 for albacore and skipjack However in some cases such as in considering the economic viability of the Pacific Island albacore fleets a higher TRP is indicated For example two papers presented at SC10 showed that for south Pacific albacore There is a 5 risk of LRP being breached if the goal is to maintain the stock at 59 SBF0 and 10 risk if the stock is maintained at 55 SBF0 Both these levels are below the current level 63 SBF0 where some south Pacific longline fleets are already struggling to make a living3 The biomass of albacore that will provide the MEY for albacore is estimated to be much higher that the level required to maintain the MEY4 For these reasons Greenpeace is urging the Commission to Adopt interim target reference points TRPs of 50 SBF0 for skipjack bigeye and yellowfin and 70 SBF0 for albacore until final TRPs are agreed by the Commission no later than 2017 Greenpeace supports the FFA proposed replacement for the conservation and management measure on establishing a harvest strategy for key tuna species in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean

WCPFC11-2014-OP11,9,The dire state of bigeye tuna indicated by the 2014 stock assessment now depleted to 16 SBF0 demands immediate and resolute action from CMMs to address the numerous weaknesses of tropical tuna measures adopted to date Both longline and purse seine fleets must share the responsibility for the demise of the bigeye stock and reduce their impacts on bigeye tuna in particular
WCPFC11-2014-OP11,10,For purse seine vessels data has clearly shown that the FAD ban period that has been progressively introduced since 2009 provides the only respite for bigeye tuna throughout the year Proposed rules such as extending the FAD ban period banning night setting and capping annual FAD use will go some way to limit FAD impacts However the dire state of bigeye tuna and the disproportionate impact of purse seine FAD sets on juvenile bigeye not to mention the bycatch of threatened species means that there is simply no justification for allowing the continued use of FADs in purse seine fisheries at all A yearround ban on FADs is long overdue and must be adopted as part of the revised CMM on tropical tunas
WCPFC11-2014-OP11,11,Longline fisheries stand the most to gain from reversing the decline of bigeye tuna and recovering stocks to a healthy level Longline fishing nations must fully cooperate in this recovery starting with providing operational level data from their fleets and agreeing to catch reductions Those CCMs that fail to comply with either data provision or catch limits should face serious penalties including the compounding catch limit deductions proposed by the FFA Transhipments at sea represent a fundamental loophole allowing IUU fleets to operate Existing prohibitions to transhipment at sea by purse seiners must be expanded to include all longline fleets Greenpeace also calls for the closure of the Pacific Commons high seas pockets to all fishing both longline and purse seine
WCPFC11-2014-OP11,12,South Pacific albacore Agreeing a comprehensive CMM for South Pacific albacore is of absolute urgency for the Commission Even with the stock at 63 BF0 range 3580 the fishery is becoming unprofitable particularly for local fleets of Small Island Developing States SIDs A TRP is urgently needed for albacore and must be set at well above the economically and biologically risky MSY level Greenpeace is therefore recommending that the Commission adopts an interim TRP for albacore of 70 SBF0
WCPFC11-2014-OP11,13,The existing CMM 201005 only limits the number of flagged fishing vessels actively fishing for South Pacific albacore in the Convention area south of 20S There are no limits on albacore catches on the high seas between the equator and 20S and major increases in efficiency and the number of set hooks means that the purpose of the limit on vessel capacity south of 20S is severely compromised
WCPFC11-2014-OP11,14,We also recognise the motivation by SIDs to develop their own fisheries for South Pacific albacore in line with their development aspiration stipulated under the Convention and in CMM 06
WCPFC11-2014-OP11,15,Greenpeace calls on CCMs to adopt a Conservation and Management Measure for South Pacific albacore which sets the basis for a reduction of fishing capacity in the fishery and puts catches in line with precautionary catch levels and to enable stock recovery to a TRP of 70 SBF0 Greenpeace believes such measure could build on the FFA proposal and must ensure that both fishing capacity and catches be brought down to sustainable levels Greenpeace recommends that decreased fishing opportunities are allocated in particular to CCMs that are not complying with data provision requirements
WCPFC11-2014-OP11,16,Sharks Recent studies from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community SPC have confirmed the common use of fishing practices that deliberately increase sharks catches This essentially involves the use of shark lines branch lines that are directly attached directly to the floats rather than the mainline with wire traces used to prevents sharks from biting free when hooked and bait that attracts sharks Two of the most commonly caught shark species oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks are targeted in this manner Recent assessments show that these species are in a very poor state with fishing rates well in excess of the FMSY and with stock declines to well below SBMSY5 6 7
WCPFC11-2014-OP11,17,In has been known for some time that Pacific blue sharks have been targeted by some longline fleets There is no assessment for South Pacific blue shark and while a recent assessment of the North Pacific stock suggests that the stock may be not be overfished the Science Committee expressed concerns that the catch data is poor and there is considerable uncertainty in the assessment8 Therefore this species should not be targeted until such time as data has improved and assessments show that the stocks are healthy
WCPFC11-2014-OP11,18,Countries can no longer use the excuse that sharks are unfortunate victims of bycatch and must put strong measures in place to prevent sharks from being targeted gear modifications that target sharks must be banned
WCPFC11-2014-OP11,19,While the greatest impact on silky and oceanic whitetip shark stocks is attributed to bycatch from the longline fishery the associated purse seine fishery also has a significant impact The fishing mortality on silky sharks from the associated purse seine fishery alone is above FMSY and these sets catch predominantly juveniles Furthermore recent research in the Indian Ocean showed that there are hidden impacts on silky sharks that have not been considered in stock assessments Silky sharks are entangled and killed in the netting and lines that typically hang below FADs in numbers that may be as much as 510 times higher than the known bycatch It is highly likely that significant mortality from FAD entanglement also occurs in the Pacific Ocean
WCPFC11-2014-OP11,20,Given the importance of sharks in the Pacific ecosystem and the continuing poor availability of data the WCPFC must agree a replacement CMM for sharks that focuses on reducing the catch of sharks Greenpeace urges the adoption of the following rules within a strengthened CMM
WCPFC11-2014-OP11,21,A ban on the use of sharks lines wire traces and shark bait on longlines A total ban on the use of FADs in association with purse seine fishing in order to help address bycatch of silky sharks and oceanic whitetip sharks The prompt and careful release of any captured silky sharks oceanic whitetip sharks and blue sharks A total prohibition of the retention transhipment storage onboard sale and landing of silky sharks oceanic whitetip sharks and blue sharks until such time that stock Rice J Harley S 2012 Stock assessment of oceanic whitetip sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean WCPFCSC82012SAWP06 httpswcpfcintnode3235 Rice J Harley S 2012 Stock assessment of silky sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean Eighth WCPFC SC82012SAWP07 httpswcpfcintnode3236 Rice J Harley S 2013 Updated Stock assessment of silky shark in the western and central Pacific Ocean WCPFCSC92013SAWP03 httpswcpfcintnode3685 WCPFC 2014 Summary Report Scientific Committee Tenth Regular Session 614 Aug 2013 Majuro Republic of the Marshall Islands httpswwwwcpfcintnode19472 assessments are of sufficient quality to demonstrate healthy stock levels BMSY or equivalent The urgent improvement to the quality and quantity of data recorded and reported for all shark catches including animal condition on release dead injured alive The further development of reference points best practice bycatch mitigation measures and management goals for all nontarget species especially sharks Strengthening the current shark finning measure from the 5 fintocarcass ratio requirement to a requirement to land all sharks with fins naturally attached This will enable better data collection and enforcement of prohibitions on the retention of atrisk species and is the approach recommended by the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks

WCPFC11-2014-OP12,3,Recommendations to the 11th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission5 December 2014 Apia Samoa A brief from Nov 2014 The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission is responsible for managing all highly migratory fish stocks including tuna and sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean Although it was established over a decade ago by a convention based on relatively modern principles of fisheries management the Commissions management of these stocks continues to be inadequate The worlds largest tuna fishery has been fished unsustainably in contradiction to strong scientific and management advice and fishing capacity continues to grow Today 50 more largescale purse seine vessels are fishing these waters than 10 years ago and two of the six commercial tuna stocks in the Convention Area are classified as overfished The Commission must take steps to ensure that the fisheries under its jurisdiction are managed responsibly and sustainably Ensuring healthy fisheries in this region requires strong conservation and management actions and strict compliance The Pew Charitable Trusts calls on all Commission Members Cooperating nonMembers and Participating Territories known collectively as CCMs to cooperate and compromise in order to End overfishing rebuild overfished populations of tuna and strengthen management to ensure ongoing sustainability Adopt conservation and management measures to protect sharks and other vulnerable species Strengthen measures to end illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing and ensure compliance by increasing the transparency of fishing operations and the accountability of CCMs Richard Hermann Turn around tuna management In 2013 several records were broken by the still growing western and central Pacific tuna fishery which last year accounted for 57 percent of the global tuna catch The haul of skipjack tuna was the largest on record 18 million metric tons and the purse seine catch of bigeye tuna reached an alltime high 82151 metric tons More than percent of individual bigeye were captured as small juveniles on fish aggregating devices FADs helping to diminish the future spawning potential of the population1 One of the factors driving these catch records is capacity creep New purse seine vessels are entering the fishery and the technology associated with drifting FADshumanmade floating objects that attract fishis evolving rapidly This leads to more tunaand non tuna species attracted to the FADsbeing caught in a fishing day and makes clear the need for management to adapt to and account for these changes With onethird of the commercially exploited tuna populations in these waters in need of rebuilding critical actions must be taken now to ensure the future of the fishery CCMs must implement target and limit reference points for all tuna populations adopt a robust rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin and effectively limit the catch of small bigeye in the FAD fishery Adopt and implement target and limit reference points To reverse concerning declines in some species and to prevent others from suffering similar fates the Commission should rapidly fulfill its obligation to develop and implement target and limit reference points for all tuna species An agreement on harvest control rules must be reached to ensure that limits are not exceeded and overall objectives of the fishery are achieved This year the Commissions Scientific Committee has recommended steps to avoid further increases in fishing mortality for skipjack and to maintain this stock near current levels The Parties to the Nauru Agreement and Tokelau are developing a target reference point for skipjack equivalent to twice the biomass that would produce maximum sustained yield Members of the Forum Fisheries Agency are proposing the adoption of a harvest strategy approach that would specify timelines for the adoption of reference points and harvest control rules for South Pacific albacore and skipjack and establish a process for doing so for other stocks This work is supported by civil society some industry members and the scientific community which have called on WCPFC to tighten purse seine controls and adopt target reference points and harvest control rules Given the broad support and increasing threats to the tuna populations WCPFC should adopt a target reference point for the skipjack fishery this year and agree on a process to implement reference points and harvest control rules for all tuna species Take concrete steps to rebuild Pacific bluefin or suspend the fishery The 2014 stock assessment update for Pacific bluefin tuna conducted by the International Scientific Committee ISC found that the population remains severely depleted at just 4 percent of its unfished biomass As part of the assessment the ISC analyzed the potential effects of seven catch scenarios Only one predicted significant population growth under current recruitment conditions which define the potential productivity of the population and therefore its ability to grow At its 2014 meeting the WCPFC Northern Committee recommended a measure that would implement shortterm catch cuts in line with the ISC analysis but the committee could agree only to a year rebuilding target of 8 percent of historic biomass As such the population will remain severely depleted at best for at least another decade WCPFC should call on the Northern Committee to revisit and strengthen the rebuilding target for Pacific bluefin tuna at its 2015 meeting and to cooperate with the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission on Pacificwide management measures that will rebuild the Pacific bluefin tuna population to at least 25 percent of its historic biomass within 10 years Rebuild the bigeye population and adopt FAD set limits The 2014 stock assessment determined that fisheries in the western and central Pacific have reduced the bigeye tuna population to 16 percent of its unfished biomass This level threatens the viability of the fishery and urgent action is needed to rebuild this population Clearly current management measures are not effective and a new approach to limiting bigeye catch is critical Temporary FAD closures aimed at reducing the mortality of small bigeye tuna in purse seine FAD sets have proved ineffective Even with longer FAD closuresfrom two months in to four months more recentlythe catch of bigeye by purse seine vessels has reached new highs Because more than 90 percent of individual bigeye caught on FADs are juveniles that have not had a chance to reproduce the future of the fishery is bleak To effectively limit the purse seine catch of bigeye the Scientific Committee recommended FAD set limits but they have not been adopted fully by the Commission This year WCPFC delegates can improve management of the purse seine fishery by adopting FAD set limits in line with the scientific advice that calls for a 36 percent reduction in fishing mortality from 200811 average levels A 2012 study showed that FAD fishing can be effectively tracked and monitored because the vast majority of the drifting devices have satellite beacons As a first step the WCPFC should work with CCMs that have built FAD monitoring systems in order to verify FAD sets across the Convention Area Ending bigeye overfishing is not a technological or scientific challenge The information and tools exist It is a matter of political will With more vessels fishing in the region and with continuing developments in FAD technology the WCPFC must act to protect the future of this billiondollar fishery WCPFC should amend CMM 201301 to further reduce bigeye tuna mortality across all fishing gears and in particular should replace ineffective FAD closures with FAD set limits in line with the scientific advice Stop the influx of fishing vessels and the rise in FAD use Purse seine capacity continues to increase A record 297 vessels fished in the western and central Pacific in Even more 305 vessels are expected to fish in 2014 In addition technological developments are leading to increases in the number of FADs used and their efficiency These factors are driving increases in catch across a range of target and nontarget species and current management measures cannot account for these efficiency gains This jeopardizes the future of western and central Pacific tuna fisheries and is an issue that the Commission can and should take action on this year As specified by CMM 201301 parties other than small island states agreed to submit to the 11th Regular Session of the WCPFC a scheme to reduce capacity to the level of 31 December 2012 These schemes should include reductions in the numbers of vessels in use and FADs deployed Strengthening conservation and management of sharks Every year about 100 million sharks are caught and killed in commercial fisheries an unsustainable number2 Whether this catch is unintended unwanted or highly sought after the impact on ocean ecosystems demands urgent action Until measures are in place to ensure that the targeted and incidental catch of sharks is sustainable their capture with fishing gear should be avoided and they should be released alive whenever possible Gear that increases the likelihood of shark catch such as wire leaders and shark lines should be prohibited and research should be undertaken to determine the best means of avoiding shark catch If WCPFC members are to continue to target sharks or retain shark bycatch the precautionary principle must be taken into account and management measures must ensure that all shark catches in the Convention Area are sustainable WCPFC fisheries must not contribute to the global overfishing of sharks that has led to severe declines wherever they are found A conservation and management measure for sharks A dedicated conservation and management measure CMM to reduce shark mortality is urgently needed to ensure that robust and enforceable measures are in place to protect sharks caught in fisheries covered by the convention In 2013 and 2014 the Scientific Committee highlighted continuing concerns over the effectiveness of and compliance with existing shark conservation and management measures Meeting reports noted the impact of continued use of wire leaders and shark lines to target sharks in longline fisheries the lack of observer coverage in those fisheries and the limited effectiveness of CMM 201007 in eliminating shark finning In 2013 the Ninth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee noted Given the current growing public concern over global shark overexploitation most CCMs consider that there is a need for the WCPFC to adopt more robust and enforceable measures for sharks to reduce mortality in both the longline and purseseine fisheries In line with this advice the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency tabled an important measure to reduce and control shark mortality at the 10th Regular Session of the WCPFC in 2013 CCMs could not reach a consensus on the proposal and it was not adopted WCPFC cannot delay taking action A new CMM must be adopted that ensures that shark catches are either mitigated through bans on wire leaders and shark lines or managed in line with precautionary scientific advice to ensure species sustainability Enforcing existing shark measures CMMs 201308 and 201104 prohibit the retention of oceanic whitetip and silky sharks These overfished species require drastic mortality reductions if they are to recover The measures mandate that all CCMs release any oceanic whitetip and silky sharks caught in the Convention Area as soon as possible after a shark is brought alongside a vessel and that it be done in a manner that results in as little harm to the shark as possible Pew strongly supports recent actions by the Republic of the Marshall Islands to effectively enforce CMM 201308 by prosecuting a vessel that retained silky sharks Pew encourages all CCMs to do the same WCPFC11 should analyze implementation of CMM 201308 and 201104 and ensure that all CCMs comply with their obligations under these measures for purse seine and longline fleets Blue sharks Blue sharks are caught in targeted fisheries and as bycatch in WCPFC fisheries Nearly 40000 metric tons have been caught annually over the last three years in the North Pacific alone Still no management measures are in place to control this catch and ensure sustainability The 10th Regular Session of the Scientific Committee in Karin Leonard assessed the status of the North Pacific blue shark stock and noted that there is significantsubstantial uncertainty associated with the level of current fishing mortality from the target fishery for blue shark and the ongoing sustainability of the stock WCPFC11 must ensure that precautionary sciencebased management measures are adopted for North Pacific blue sharks to ensure that both targeted fisheries and bycatch for this species are sustainable The status of blue sharks in the South Pacific remains unclear It should be a priority to ensure that the status of South Pacific blue sharks is fully understood so appropriate effective management can be put in place Data collection Efforts to assess shark stock status in the western and central Pacific make clear that data recording and reporting on the catch of shark species is limited and that this information gap significantly hampers development of comprehensive scientific advice The WCPFC should adopt a no data no fish measure for sharks similar to the measure put in place by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas This would prevent CCMs from retaining or landing any of the 14 key shark species identified by WCPFC if they had not submitted landing data on any catch of that species from the previous year Enhance CCMs transparency and accountability As in other parts of the world IUU fishing remains a threat in the WCPFC Convention Area The Commission has taken important steps to improve compliance with its management measures but the WCPFC cannot do its job effectively unless it requires complete transparency from all CCMs and imposes serious consequences for any lack of compliance with these requirements To further limit IUU fishing the Commission should Adopt minimum standards for port inspections Port State measures or PSMs are costeffective tools to monitor compliance with management arrangements and prevent illegal fish from entering the market WCPFC has repeatedly considered adoption of such measures and the WCPFC performance review has recommended their adoption3 Following steps taken at its 10th Regular Session the Commission should formally agree to the development of a regional scheme of PSMs by adopting minimum standards for port inspections and providing adequate support to developing States for their implementation Harmonize WCPFC vessel records and improve transparency WCPFC substantially enhanced the ability to identify fishing vessels in its waters by agreeing last year to mandate that all vessels weighing at least 100 gross tons or 100 gross registered tons have International Maritime Organization numbers Moreover the WCPFC secretariat has continued to improve its Record of Fishing Vessels by making it more informative and userfriendly To ensure greater transparency of fishing operations additional vessel information should be included in the Record The Commission should require that as of 1 January 2016 CCMs provide to the secretariat information on any enforcement action taken on vessels operating in the Convention Area as soon as the information becomes available This information should be published as part of the Record Enhance the effectiveness of the IUU vessel list Placing a vessel on WCPFCs IUU vessel list is a necessary step to highlight and deter unacceptable practices in the Convention Area The effectiveness of this list is diminished however because IUU vessels can be added only once a year As a result these vessels are able to operate unhindered until the Commission meets and agrees to list them At the same time the WCPFC permits the removal of vessels from its IUU vessel list intersessionally CCMs should establish a procedure that allows IUU vessels to be listed between sessions The IUU vessel list also should be updated continuouslywhenever a vessel changes its name flag or other characteristic Ban transshipment at sea Transshipment at sea continues to be an opportunity to avoid proper catch reporting and to launder illicitly caught fish Transshipment at sea should not be allowed to occur until it can be ensured that these operations do not contribute to IUU fishing This would require having a robust monitoring system that ensures full transparency mandating observers andor fisheries officers on board the offloading and receiving vessels and complete oversight by the Commission of all transshipment operations in the Convention Area WCPFC should ban all forms of transshipment at sea until it can be ensured that these operations do not contribute to IUU fishing Courtesy of Australian

WCPFC11-2014-OP14,4,The original version of the letter was circulated to CCMs as WCPFC Circular 201499 The original letter circulated as WCPFC Circular 201499 has been replaced with an revised letter that includes an update to the signatures November 19 2014 Dr Lara ManarangiTrott Interim Executive Director Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Kaselehlie Street PO Box 2356 Kolonia Pohnpei State 96941 Federated States of Micronesia Dear Dr ManarangiTrott This letter is submitted on behalf of the undersigned nongovernmental and industry organizations that participate and have a strong interest in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC processes and outcomes Collectively our organizations have thousands of staff working in offices and partner organizations in over a 100 countries and engage suppliers and provide advice to retailers buyers and food service sectors regarding improvements in tuna sustainability In addition the undersigned industry organizations represent a considerable number of purse seine longline and pole line vessels active in WCPO tuna fisheries We are writing to the Commission regarding the serious problem of nonprovision of operational catch and effort data by four Commission members China Japan Korea and Chinese Taipei The nonprovision of operational level data from these CCMs must be addressed by the Commission at its upcoming meeting in Apia Samoa as an urgent priority consistent with the standards set out in the Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission The Science Provider SPC has clearly enumerated the impact of operational level data gaps at recent meetings of the Scientific Committee and Technical and Compliance Committee These impacts include Inadequate breakdown of catcheffort by areas of national jurisdiction and the high seas or estimate catcheffort between EEZs and the high seas and therefore unable to provide scientific advice that effectively ameliorates the impact of fishing Inability to accurately attribute catches from flag States to charter States due to possible doublecounting Failure to provide a complete set of catch and effort data for the public domain because of adherence to the Commissions 3 vessel rule for public domain data Insufficient assessment of the effectiveness of aspects of conservation measures particularly spatial elements Preventing the use of finescale stock assessment models such as the SEAPODYM model that rely on operational level data as the fisherydependent data input Increased uncertainties in stock assessments due to inability to determine the effects of targeting shifts on catches and catch rates which affect the scientific advice in unknown ways Undermining the ability to identify historical trends in stock status that are not evident in aggregate data and that could be taken into account in the stock assessments for example obtaining a better understanding of declines in longline bigeye tuna CPUE which are not apparent without access to operational data Lack of integration between high seas VMS data with catch and effort data that is critical in verifying manual reporting information and operational data against VMS reports Ineffectual verification and reconciliation of transhipment reports between the volumes of catch reported as transhipped and reported catches in logbooks and Inability to determine the effectiveness of different mitigation methods on specific nontarget species
WCPFC11-2014-OP14,5,These four Commission members all have significant fleets operating in the WCPO but have never provided the required operational level data to WPCFC Moreover none of these CCMs have submitted plans to resolve the impediments preventing the provision of operational catch and effort data as requested by the Commission in 2010 Furthermore the failure to provide operational level data by some of these same four CCMs is not limited only to the WCPO A recent paper presented at the IOTC Working Party on Tropical Tunas held from 1519 November in Bali Indonesia httpwwwiotcorgdocumentsspatial considerationsbigeyeandyellowfincpuejapaneseandtaiwanchinalongline illustrates how insufficient operational level data undermines the development of standardized longline CPUE indices which are critically important inputs to stock assessments of bigeye and yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean This is an unacceptable situation and one that is not only undermining the effectiveness of WCPFC conservation and management measures its MCS tools the work of the scientists and transparency but is also providing an unfair advantage to those nations because their degree of compliance cannot be evaluated Moreover it continues to place an unfair conservation burden on other WCPFC members who are implementing the conservation measures in good faith consistent with international law
WCPFC11-2014-OP14,6,We note that an arrangement was drafted on the margins of SC10 between some of these CCMs and SPC to facilitate the availability of operational data for the Pacific wide bigeye stock assessment scheduled for 2015 See Attachment F of the SC10 Report While this arrangement may provide for some limited access to these needed data next year it should not be viewed as a substitute for these CCMs complying in full with the WCPFC data reporting requirements nor should it be seen as fulfilling these fishing nations outstanding reporting obligations
WCPFC11-2014-OP14,7,We urge the following actions to address this matter and to broadly deter CCM noncompliance with WCPFC obligations at its upcoming meeting in Apia That these members act immediately to remedy this noncompliance and act in a manner consistent with their binding obligations to the WCPFC Convention That the WCPFC take swift action such as triggering paragraph 7 of the WCPFC Data Rules for NonPublic Domain Data as well as urgently developing adopting and implementing a scheme for WCPFC responses to noncompliance as called for in the Compliance Monitoring Scheme measure paragraph 1iv of CMM 201302 including assessing appropriate penalties to effectively deter this type of repeated and serious non compliance That the Commission consider using its voting provisions as outlined in Article 20 of the Convention to address this persistent noncompliance in providing operational level data if a decision by the Commission is going to be blocked by those members

WCPFC11-2014-OP15,5,Recommendations to the 11th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission
WCPFC11-2014-OP15,6,The International Game Fish Association IGFA is a nonprofit organization that represents recreational anglers throughout the world IGFA was established in 1939 has active members in over 100 countries is the governing body for international recreational fishing and provides rules for ethical angling practices Many of IGFAs members target the highly migratory species managed by WCPFC especially marlin sailfish and spearfish ie billfish which are primarily caught and released
WCPFC11-2014-OP15,7,IGFA has great concern about how highly migratory species are being managed on a global level for recreational anglers The lack of data and accurate reporting on billfish catch is of particular concern As an organization that is committed to the conservation of game fishes IGFA has deployed 162 popup satellite archival tags in marlin around the world in the past three years many of which have been in waters under this organizations purview The information gained from this exercise is available to your scientific committee
WCPFC11-2014-OP15,8,Billfish Although primarily a commercial bycatch species billfish are highly sought after recreational species that are primarily caught and released We urge the WCPFC to set a target reference rate above BMSY for recreational anglers The WCNPO stock of striped marlin is overfished and experiencing overfishing Reducing fishing mortality would likely increase spawning stock biomass and may improve the chances of higher recruitment We recommend fishing at a constant catch of 2500 mt that would lead to potential increases in spawning biomass of 133 to 223 by 2017 Although not currently overfished or experiencing overfishing we recommend that fishing mortality not be increased for blue marlin so that the stock can rebound to levels in excess of BMSY No formal stock assessments exist for sailfish and black marlin Better data collection is necessary for these species so that their true abundance can be accurately estimated IGFA further recommends implementing a prohibition on Pacific billfish entering into international trade Similar legislation has recently been passed at the request of IGFA in the United States that now bans importation of marlin sailfish and spearfish into the continental United States We also recommend all countries be required to report dead discards and use circle hooks in their longline fisheries
WCPFC11-2014-OP15,9,Tuna The 2014 stock assessment update indicates that Pacific Bluefin tuna have been reduced to only 4 of their virgin biomass Yet at the 2014 meeting the WCPFC Northern Committee agreed to only a 10 year rebuilding target of less than 7 of historic biomass These actions are insufficient to address the status of Pacific bluefin tuna and will result in the stock remaining in a severely depleted condition for at least another decade The WCPFC should direct the Northern Committee to establish a target that has a reasonable likelihood of rebuilding the stock The WCPFC should also work closely with the Inter American Tropical Tuna Commission to enact Pacificwide management measures that would restore Pacific bluefin abundance to at least 25 of its historic biomass within 10 years
WCPFC11-2014-OP15,10,The International Game Fish Association is a notforprofit organization committed to the conservation of game fish and the promotion of responsible ethical angling practices through science education rule making and record keeping Email HQigfaorg Website wwwigfaorg
WCPFC11-2014-OP15,11,Page 2
WCPFC11-2014-OP15,12,According to the 2014 stock assessment the bigeye tuna stock has been depleted by 84 Excessive harvest of juvenile fish around FADs by purse seine gear continues to be problematic as temporary FAD closures have proved largely ineffective The IGFA urges the WPFC to enact FAD set limits to reduce juvenile bigeye harvest as well as to implement measures that will reduce bigeye mortality across all fishing gears in line with scientific advice Pacific skipjack represent the worlds largest tuna fishery yet no target reference points exist IGFA urges the WCPFC to adopt a target reference point for this fishery this year and also agree to implement target reference points and harvest control rules for all major tuna species
WCPFC11-2014-OP15,13,Sharks The IGFA urges the WCPFC to develop a dedicated conservation and management measure for sharks that bans wire traces on all longlines and utilizes precautionary scientific advice to manage them sustainably
WCPFC11-2014-OP15,14,IUU IGFA recommends that WPCFC strengthen the controls against illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing Specifically we urge the commission to establish a procedure that allows IUU vessels to be listed and removed throughout the year so that a comprehensive list of IUU vessels can be maintained Transhipment at sea facilitates IUU fishing and the IGFA recommends that the WCPFC ban all forms of transhipment at sea until it can be demonstrated that such operations are not contributing to IUU fishing
WCPFC11-2014-OP15,15,General Recreational angling is an established and important economic entity in developed countries and a growing one in many developing nations As such we wish that WCPFC recognize both its relevance and that it may necessitate alternate management objectives than those used in commercial fisheries IGFA kindly offers its consultation to WCPFC on recreational fisheries issues
WCPFC11-2014-OP15,16,Managing fisheries on the basis of MSY is an excessively riskprone approach As such we suggest that WCPFC adopt a target objective above BMSY to compensate for biological environmental and data uncertainties Many recreational fisheries are catch and release in nature where anglers prefer to catch more and bigger fish than to necessarily harvest fish In addition to its inherent uncertainty managing stocks on the level of MSY not only reduces the abundance of fish but also their average size Maintaining stocks at higher abundances benefits recreational anglers that release their fish and also contributes to the substantial economic value of these fisheries We feel this is especially true with bycatch species such as marlin and sailfish that have little commercial value but great economic value to recreational anglers
WCPFC11-2014-OP15,17,The prevalence and importance of artisanal fisheries within the WCPFCs purview must be taken into consideration Better catch data from these fisheries is necessary to evaluate their impact on HMS fisheries
WCPFC11-2014-OP17,1,ELEVENTH REGULAR SESSION Faleata Sports Complex Apia SAMOA 5 December 2014 SPREP Statement WCPFC112014OP17 December 201430 Prepared By SPREP PO Box 240 Apia Samoa E sprepspreporg T 685 21929 The Pacific environment sustaining our livelihoods and natural heritage in harmony with our cultures STATEMENT TO THE 11TH SESSION OF THE WESTERN CENTRAL PACIFIC FISHERIES COMMISSION BY THE SECRETARIAT FOR THE PACIFIC REGIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME SPREP Mr Chairman Honourable Ministers Distinguished Delegates On behalf of the DirectorGeneral of SPREP I should like to extend our thanks for the opportunity to address the meeting As you know SPREP is not a regular participant in the meetings of the WCPFC but as the only regional agency based here in Samoa and one that takes a great interest in the deliberations of the Commission we are delighted to be able to participate in this weeks discussions As the Pacific regional agency for the environment SPREP is recognized as the lead on 4 key areas biodiversity and ecosystems climate change waste management and pollution and environmental monitoring and governance in the Pacific Region We focus on strengthening partnerships and cooperation among Pacific Island countries territories on these areas Environmental management protection is SPREPs priority focus Sustainable management of marine habitats and resources is at the core of our mission Tuna are not the only migratory marine species to feature extensively in Pacific Island cultures and history Whales dolphins turtles and sharks are also iconic species and additionally they provide an increasingly economically valuable niche for Pacific Island countries in the growing ecotourism market SPREP is engaged in a number of projects to conserve and protect endangered and threatened species and to provide an economic benefit for those coastal communities involved as guardians for these emblematic species However the populations of many species of cetaceans turtles and sharks in the region are at historically low levels and many are critically endangered or endangered often through by catch from commercial fishing Migratory species are particularly vulnerable because their journeys between breeding grounds and feeding grounds often take them through the EEZs of various Pacific Island countries and international waters Efforts made to promote protection and conservation within EEZs can be nullified unless similar measures are taken on the high seas Sharks are highly valued in the Pacific Islands and this has been reflected in recent years by the declaration of shark sanctuaries in many countries such as Palau the Marshall Islands and Tokelau the introduction of bans on shark finning in the EEZs of many other countries and the leadership role taken by several countries in signing the Convention on Migratory Species MoU on migratory sharks SPREP is very concerned at the impacts of both targeted take and bycatch of sharks in the regions tuna fisheries and SPREP members which include all Pacific island countries and territories have requested that SPREP develop a Shark Action Plan It has become clear that many species of pelagic sharks have been overfished in recent years most notably silky sharks and oceanic whitetips SPREP has been working closely with several of its member countries to improve the protection afforded to a number of shark species in the region through the Convention on Migratory Species and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species We are hopeful that the Commission will this week agree to pass a new Conservation Management Measure that will effectively address the problem of shark bycatch and targeted catch in both longline and purseseine fisheries SPREP is also committed to working with the Commission other regional agencies and stakeholders to better understand the extent and significance of bycatch of turtles and cetaceans in both longline and purseseine fisheries and to the development of mitigation measures SPREP has recently become more actively engaged in the problem of marine debris and its impacts on marine megafauna and is currently sponsoring a research programme on the provenance and distribution of plastic and other debris in the Pacific Islands region and will be contributing to UNEPs Global Marine Litter Campaign In that regard SPREP is concerned about the possible impacts of drifting FADs on turtles and other migratory species and is anxious to learn more from this weeks meeting We also seek to work closely with all fishing fleets and Pacific Island states to improve the regions port facilities for the reception of damaged nets and other fishing gear and to encourage all vessels to retain their nondegradable waste on board for safe disposal on shore SPREP supports and promotes the establishment of Marine Protected Areas both large and small which present tremendous opportunities for Pacific Islands to improve the resilience and conservation of biodiversity in the face of increasing threats from climate change and overexploitation Although most Pacific Islands have small land masses they are in fact Large Ocean States with jurisdiction over nearly of the global ocean Many Pacific Island Governments such as Kiribati Cook Islands and New Caledonia have in recent years declared very large MPAs within their EEZs SPREP believes that well managed MPAs can play an important role in protecting pelagic fisheries from overexploitation while also protecting other important ecosystem services including carbon sequestration resilience for coral reefs and other marine biodiversity from the impacts of global warming coastal protection from storms and replenishment of local fisheries The issue of climate change is of enormous concern to all Pacific Island States Ocean acidification caused by rising levels of carbon dioxide in the ocean is a clear and growing threat to the regions pelagic tuna fisheries as well as coastal fisheries and coral reef structure throughout the region In association with the Governments of the USA and New Zealand SPREP convened a workshop on ocean acidification immediately prior to the recent SIDS conference here in Apia This workshop noted the adverse effects of increasing acidification on the survival of yellowfin tuna larvae SPREP will continue to be strongly engaged in developing a monitoring network for ocean acidification within the Pacific Islands region and welcomes the support of Pacific Island governments members of the Commission regional organisations and other stakeholders in this initiative Pacific Island nations are uniquely dependent on the Ocean and can rightly claim to be at the forefront of global efforts to improve sustainable management and conservation of marine resources SPREP is committed to a leadership role for Pacific communities in the preservation of their iconic marine fauna for future generations and looks forward to an increasing collaboration with the Commission and its members and other stakeholders to achieve this

WCPFC12-2015-OP02,5,WWF POSITIONth Regular Session of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC Bali Indonesia December 38 2015 Introduction The World Wide Fund for Nature WWF would like to again thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC for the opportunity to attend the 12th Regular Session as an observer and to address the critically important role that it plays in the proper management of the Western Central Pacific Ocean WCPO fisheries WWF once again calls on members of the WCPFC to address the issues and recommendations raised at SC11 TCC11 and WCPFC11 as well as observe the experience of other RFMOs in their own efforts to achieve and maintain improved measures for monitoring and surveillance WWF would like to note that this Position Statement is not comprehensive but that fact does not mean that WWF does not think that other issues not included herein are not important WWF wishes to reiterate its position offered in Apia Samoa in December 2014 WCPFC11 and taking into account the WCPFCrelated meetings held since the recommendations listed below as well as other documents submitted to the WCPFC for review as Observer Papers Reference Points Harvest Control Rules and Harvest Strategies WWF remains supportive of the work of the WCPFC and subsidiary bodies in pursuing the implementation of Reference Points RP Harvest Control Rules HCR and Harvest Strategies HS Consistent with previous WWF position statements and recommendations WWF encourages the WCPFC12 to develop and implement the adoption of explicit Target Reference Points TRPs HCRs and HSs for all WCPO fishery stocks under WCPFC authority Therefore WWF welcomes CMM 201406 to develop and implement a harvest strategy approach for key fisheries and stocks in the WCPO We support the approach that the CMM seeks the Commissions agreement to formally develop a HS approach to fisheries for the major tuna stocks under the Commissions purview with a goal toward achieving individual harvest strategies for specific fisheries developed in accordance with this CMM that in turn set out the management actions necessary to achieve defined biological economic and social objectives for each fishery If WCPFC12 takes appropriate action on this CMM and recommendations from the Harvest Strategy Workshop HSW it will provide a sufficient framework for moving forward management in a methodical way to Gregg Yan WWF POSITION DECEMBER Smart Fishing Initiative WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 12th Regular Session Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 result in valid and effective RPs and HCRs as well as a formalised Management Strategy Evaluation MSE process WWF strongly commends the initiative of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement PNA to establish and implement a TRP for the SKJ stock in PNA waters WWF also supports the Pacific Island Forum Fisheries Agencys FFA development of CMM for a TRP for South Pacific albacore SPA recently presented for review by the WCPFC Both proposals present welldefined scientificallybased and strong commitments to sustainability and precaution We strongly encourage the Commission to adopt these TRPs for implementation throughout the WCPO Lastly WWF notes the SC11 and TCC11 support for the analyses of these important management measures as well as their recommendation that WCPFC12 take the results of the papers presented at this meeting into consideration when considering the adoption of TRPs and HCRs for the key target species WWF recommends that the WCPFC Adopt and implement the proposed timelines and recommendations for fully implementing CMM 201406 Adopt and Implement a CMM consistent with proposed recommendations on a TRP for skipjack tuna at a level of 050SSBF0t1t2 Adopt and Implement a CMM consistent with proposed recommendations on a TRP for South Pacific albacore Tuna at a level of 045SSBF0 Support the continued development and implementation of LRPs and TRPs as a priority for proper management of all stocks Support interim precautionary TRPs as a benchmark for further consideration in all other stocks managed by the WCPFC in 2015 and Support the continued development and implementation of HCRs that ensure the transparent and efficient management of stocks in relation to LRPs and TRPs Sharks and Rays Many shark species in the WCPO remain subject to high levels of fishing mortality that current stock assessment trends suggest could be unsustainable1 Sharks play a critical role in the WCPO marine ecosystem as apex predators and indicators of ecosystem health2 WWF is concerned with shark conservation and sustainability in the WCPFC region as a whole and considers responsible management trade and consumption where shark mortality occurs in all fishing activities not just in circumstances where tuna fishing is occurring Therefore WCPFC must also recognise the needs of coastal States in the WCPFC region to manage their shark populations Although WWF supports the minor action taken by the WCPFC in CMM 201405 Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks3 WWF continues to support recommendations made previously by the SC and drawn from the discussion regarding a proposed comprehensive and integrated shark CMM4 By way of reference we again endorse the recommendations contained in sections 41 and 42 of the paper previously presented by Dr Shelley Clarke in addition to measures recommended below5 Furthermore WWF endorses the recent action taken by the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC to support best practices for safe handling and release manta rays genus Mobula and Manta aboard purse seiners Consistent with additional calls from CCMs during the SC11 meeting WWF encourages the WCPFC to pursue equivalent or consistent measures for mantas in the WCPFC Convention Area WWF recommends the WCPFC Develop endorse and recommend adoption of a Comprehensive Shark CMM that includes efforts to o Mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 12th Regular Session Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 o Implement the recommendations for bycatch that were endorsed at Kobe III and adopt an annually updated report card system against these recommendations for all of the WCPFC fisheries o Require through data collected from observer programs and other means estimation of the number of captures and releases of all sharks and rays including the status upon release dead or alive and reporting of this information to the WCPFC o Require through observer programs recording what gear is used in longline activities including the use of wire traces and any multi monofilament traces in order to avoid biteoff by sharks o Introduce a scheme to document the capture and trade of sharks whereby it allows for traceability through to the final market state and consider the recommendations included in the TRAFFIC report produced for the CITES Secretariat when developing such a scheme and o Ensure the implementation requirements for CITES listed sharks are undertaken by CITES Parties and NonParties trading with CITES Parties where they are required to make nondetriment and legal findings in order to issue export permits for trade in these species6 Where WCPFC members make nondetriment findings for shark species they should share with the WCPFC details of those findings so that the WCPFC Secretariat can provide information to the CITES Standing Committee working group on sharks before January 7 Develop endorse and recommend safe handling and release practices for manta rays genus Mobula and Manta aboard purse seiners Encourage the development of reference points and management for nontarget species including all shark and ray species as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Encourage CCMs to report all shark and ray catches from domestic fleets operating in territorial and archipelagic waters and Endorse recommendations made in EBWP03 EBIP05 EBWP06 and EBWP submitted for SC11 including introducing safe handling practices for whale sharks Rhincodon typus caught within WCPFC purse seine fisheries and Revise and amend the shark reporting processes to WCPFC to streamline shark related data and to close data gaps Sea Turtles WWF supports the recent intervention at TCC11 by the United States requesting renewed focus on sea turtle bycatch in the WCPO tuna fisheries WWF continues to believe that CMM 200803 for the Conservation and Management of Sea Turtles has not demonstrably reduced bycatch impacts on threatened and endangered sea turtles in the region The cumulative impact of increasing numbers of longline vessels in the WCPO on sea turtles remains problematic and there has been insufficient uptake of proven bycatch mitigation measures such as circle hook andor finfish bait All 6 species of sea turtles in the WCPO remain threatened or endangered With no evidence of CMM 200803 having slowed or reversed negative trends on threatened and endangered sea turtle populations the burden of proof remains on the WCPFC to demonstrate that sea turtle bycatch impacts in tuna operations are being minimized and to take stronger measures if they are not being minimized WWF believes that there exists a strong basis for revising CMM 200803 to 1 ensure more suitable requirements for the determination of optimal bycatch mitigation packages ie circle hooks andor other measures such as finfish bait for individual fisheries 2 reduce the ambiguity in language and 3 improve the definition of the desired outcomes of the CMM Moreover evidence suggests that the WCPFC and member states have not suitably monitored the CMM for effectiveness with some parts of the CMM distinguished as providing excessive room for creative compliance8 While CMM 200803 requires all longline vessels to carry turtle dehookers and line cutters WCPFC has provided no WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 12th Regular Session Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of this requirement and only a small fraction of member countries have conducted dedicated research on sea turtle mitigation techniques9 Indeed as recently as 2010 over three quarters of CCMs either did not report on compliance with CMM 200803 or did not meet all the CMM measures Furthermore only a small fraction of member countries have conducted dedicated research on sea turtle mitigation techniques and current observer coverage falls well below the recommended level for effectively determining optimal mitigation approaches ie 10 coverage over 3 years The precautionary principle requires that all CCMs must determine optimal bycatch mitigation strategies based on research and sound science Most importantly WWF believes that the WCPFC should reconsider CMM 200803 in light of new information available regarding fisheries impacts on sea turtles and the impacts of various mitigation measures on turtle bycatch10 Specifically recent studies in the Eastern Pacific Ocean as well as atsea trials by WWF in Vietnam and Papua New Guinea further confirm the positive impact of turtle bycatch mitigation using circle hooks thereby indicating a need for further consideration and adoption of circle hooks in the WCPO longline fisheries11 WWF recommends the WCPFC Consider and develop revisions of CMM 20083 aimed at o reducing the ambiguity in language strengthening key language and reducing the vagueness in desired outcomes of the CMM thereby enabling better monitoring of CMM effectiveness o introducing new binding measures for the use of circle hooks in all longline fleets exempted only if an equally effective solution for the mortality of sea turtles can be demonstrated o introducing stronger measures for conducting research on mitigation techniques and reporting on sea turtle impacts as a means of determining optimal mitigation packages for individual fleets and o setting an appropriate interim catch rate that would trigger moveon provisions Encourage member state involvement and participation in the research conducted under the analysis of sea turtle mitigation measure effectiveness in tuna longline fisheries described in EBWP05 presented at SC11 Tropical Tunas WWF maintains that the policy choices made repeatedly by the WCPFC fail to achieve meaningful conservation of BET WWF also believe that there could be substantial improvements to the understanding of the impact of Fish Aggregating Devices FADs through the aggressive pursuit of improved monitoring surveillance and general research involving FADs followed by appropriately targeted limits or management measures While there are ongoing efforts within the SPC and PNA to pursue greater understanding of FAD dynamics we believe that the WCPFC should impose measures in support of FAD research aided by monitoring and surveillance mechanisms which could for instance improve the understanding of the impacts on species composition resulting from FAD typesize Geographic location Drift patterns and prevailing currents Ocean depth and depth of FAD materials Proximity to benthic reliefhydrogeographic features The WCPFC absolutely must make effective and enforceable reductions of the catch in all sectors to achieve a meaningful conservation impact for BET Most importantly whatever measures the WCPFC selects absolutely must be subject to strong monitoring control and surveillance measures WWF recommends that the WCPFC Establish and support further research and monitoring of FADs WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 12th Regular Session Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 Engage in an open and transparent deliberative process based on the best available scientific information to determine the level of reductions in BET catch necessary to achieve meaningful BET conservation and Revise the current Tropical Tunas CMM to achieve substantial reductions in BET mortality Regional Observer Programme Information collected as part of an appropriate observer programme is critically important to the proper management of a fishery Data collected by observers plays a central role in informing fisheries scientists on everything ranging from stock assessments to nontarget species impacts Furthermore observers play an indispensable role in monitoring and enforcing very important CMMs in the WCPO Indeed observers represent the vanguard of fisheries management through the science and service that they provide Consequently observer coverage and the safety and security of those observers must be considered a top priority and greater support must be provided to the relevant authority to see that the capacity of the ROP is strengthened Observer Programme Management and Administration The WCPFC must ensure through appropriate guidance that national observer programmes administered under the ROP are fully resourced in terms of human and financial capital as well as governed under appropriate administrative and management structures Within that consideration the WCPFC must contemplate different funding models that CCMs may consider for ensuring proper administration and management of the observer program at a national level including those that incorporate sustainable financing through a valid and functional cost recovery system The WCPFC has given inadequate consideration to the necessary resourcing of one of the most critical parts of fisheries management in the region the national and regional observer programmes Urgent attention must be given to the development and full funding of minimum standards that ensure a national programme can perform to ROP standards including such efforts as continued annual reviews of the national programs under preagreed performance standards as well as continued regular training for all regional and national observer programme staff Observer Coverage on Longline Vessels WWF notes that observer coverage on longline vessels operating in the WCPO regardless of the metrics used to calculate it remains substantially less than 5 regionwide Moreover WWF wishes to point out that the 5 observer coverage value identified by the WCPFC represents an arbitrary benchmark that was never intended to represent an end goal but rather a minimum starting point toward appropriate observer coverage Even a consistently applied level of 5 coverage is statistically and practically useless for most management or monitoring control and surveillance MCS purposes Therefore WWF supports efforts to improve the observer coverage of all longline fisheries in the WCPO As such WWF supports calculating observer coverage according to the proposed hierarchy of four metrics for assessing observer coverage but notes that best practice would be to use number of hooks deployed as an appropriate metric If other metrics for calculating coverage are used terms must be very clearly defined in advance and each metric must be calculated in a way to be comparable to the other metrics WWF also notes that different levels of observer coverage may be required for management or compliance purposes depending on specific identified objectives and recommends that appropriate analyses be conducted to determine each of those levels respectively in the context of identified objectives Most importantly the WCPFC must demand that the ROP and national observer programmes receive full funding and support to ensure their continued operation and that the level of observer coverage on longline vessels be increased immediately to achieve management and compliance objectives WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 12th Regular Session Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 Transhipment Monitoring Transhipment remains one of the most prominent weaknesses in catch documentation and verification that leads to Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU catch in the WCPO WWF notes that the most simple efficient and effective solution to the challenges of transhipmentrelated IUU is to simply prohibit all atsea transhipment and require all fishing vessels to land their catch at the nearest available designated port in the WCPO following the conclusion of fishing activity However acknowledging that a prohibition on transhipment is unlikely at this point WWF supports an unequivocal 100 observer monitoring requirement for all transhipments WWF further encourages the Commission to consider the recommendations of the IWGROP to adopt the proposed amendments to CMM 200906 to establish additional reporting requirements for receiving vessels operating in the Convention Area12 WWF also supports the guidelines and suggested format for reporting to the Secretariat although WWF would also encourage the development of fully electronic templates13 Most importantly WWF strongly recommends that due to the prominent compliance monitoring role of transhipment observers that they receive twoway communication devices described in the following section as a matter of urgent priority WWF also recommends that transhipment requirements be buttressed by verification and validation of transhipment activities through the use of a vessel monitoring system VMS and supplemented by an operating automated identification system AIS If through investigation of suspected unreported transhipment activity indicated by VMS and corroborated by AIS it is determined that transhipment activity was conducted in violation of transhipment rules the offending vessel should be subject to sanctions up to and including listing on the IUU vessel blacklist Observer Safety and Security In the course of their official duties observers are vulnerable to assault obstruction resistance delay intimidation or interference which are all very clear violations under CMM 200701 Attachment K Annex 1 Paragraph 1i Thus observer providers and authorities have a discrete obligation to address alleged violations reported by observers quickly and effectively When national or regional observer programmes and other authorities fail to address these reported violations effectively and in a timely manner it signals to the observer that providers either do not care or are incapable of providing support for their welfare Moreover the failure of providers or the national authorities to act on a report has an additional effect of signalling to vessel captains and crew that they may conduct violations against observers without retribution Following recent tragedies involving observers both in the WCPFC and IATTC Convention areas the WCPFC must urgently address observer safety and security standards The WCPFC must immediately adopt standards that include the means for an observer to independently report or otherwise signal in real time any emergency including interference or assault Currently available technology could allow direct and independent communication between observers and observer providers Many of the devices also operate as a waterproof Personal Locator Beacons PLBs in cases of an accidental overboard situation Furthermore observer programmes must also urgently adopt an Emergency Action Plan EAP that designates procedures to ensure that observer emergencies can be quickly and effectively responded to by authorities The technology tools are effectively useless to the observer if there is nobody designated to respond on the other end WWF believes that every observer should be issued one of these devices and observer programmes must have a welldefined and effective EAP in place prior to any observer deployment Lastly the WCPFC must also implement a recordkeeping and reporting mechanism that requires any violations against observers to be forwarded to the WCPFC Secretariat Secretariat as soon as possible after the incident has occurred By informing the Secretariat the Secretariat may then alert and potentially coordinate with other observer programmes immediately such as in cases of man overboard situations that require search and recovery coordination The Secretariat could also offer assistance to the programme and the observer where possible as well as provide followup to ensure corrective actions have been taken on behalf of the observer More importantly the Secretariat could WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 12th Regular Session Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 maintain a record of vessels and crewmembers involved in violations against observers which could be made available to observer providers to better assess future placement of observers and avoid potential escalation of threats against observers WWF recommends the WCPFC Further implement of a binding consistent and consolidated set of standards for the ROP Develop an analysis of the observer programme in the context of proper management including an analysis of different sustainable funding models Endorse an analysis of levels of observer coverage required to achieve management or compliance purposes while ensuring that the metrics and methodologies used support development of appropriate comparative analyses Support or endorse the use of VMS and AIS to verify and validate 100 observer coverage on all transhipments as well as supporting strong penalties and sanctions for violations Mandate authorised observer programmes to provide observers before any boarding for a trip o An approved independent two way communication satellite device and o A waterproof personal lifesaving beacon Mandate authorised observer programmes to develop and implement an Emergency Action Plan EAP to accommodate any observer emergency including interference or assault and Mandate recordkeeping and reporting requirements that compel all CCMs to report all instances of violations against of observers as soon as possible to the WCPFC Secretariat Pacific Bluefin Tuna Technical reports of both the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC and the IATTC indicate that the Pacific Bluefin tuna stock is in extremely poor condition The ISC confirmed that overfishing is occurring the stock is heavily overfished and its spawning stock biomass has declined by as much as 9614 This is a clear indicator that the management measures taken both in the Western and Central Pacific and in the Eastern Pacific are proving insufficient to conserve the biological integrity of this stock The IATTC and WCPFC must assume their share of responsibility The last assessment confirms that the stock is highly depleted that fishing mortality exceeds all reasonable proxies for Fmsy The recovery of the stock may be further delayed if the current scenario of low recruitment continues which is heavily reliant on a major adult cohort in the population While the WCPFC adopted conservation measures calling for reductions in catch for Pacific bluefin tuna of 30 kg in size conservation of spawning stocks is also needed WWF maintains deep concerns regarding this stock with an aim of restoring and rebuilding this ecologically sociologically and economically important fishery resource The current science strongly indicates that there is only one reproductive cohort that is reaching the end of its life Additionally about 90 of the stock fished is comprised of young fish that have not yet reproduced Thus the continued reproductive success of the entire stock depends on the reproductive success of a single cohort leaving the stock in a critical situation that may seriously jeopardize recruitment WWF encourages close monitoring of fisheries and catch as well as completion of a revised stock assessment for Pacific bluefin in early 2016 WWF urges both IATTC and WCPFC to adopt a long term Pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan targeting 20SSBF0 and harvest control rules that are well defined preagreed and contain mandatory actions for a determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points The WCPFC consistent with the best scientific information must act to ensure that fishing mortality on Pacific bluefin tuna be urgently reduced especially on juveniles in order to reduce the risk of WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 12th Regular Session Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 recruitment collapse and allow spawning stock to rebuild If the WCPFC fails to adopt sufficient management measures at this meeting it may be forced to consider a prohibition on continued fishing of the stock in the near future WWF recommends that the WCPFC Adopt a longterm Pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan targeting at least 20SSB0 by and Implement a size limit for Pacific bluefin tuna of 30kg to conserve spawning stock in addition to the current temporary management measure

conductedinaresponsiblemannerThisdocumentisglobalinscopebutdoesnotintend to supersede any existing international regional national state provincial or local laworobserver programmerequirementswhichmaybemoreextensiveorrestrictive Recognising that fishing is considered to be the worlds most dangerous occupation withmorethan24000casualties peryearInternationalLabour Organisation1999and observers are deployed to a wide range of entities the intent of this document is to provide regulatory authorities and observer programmes with a set of international standardsforresponsiblepractices with aview toward minimisingthehealth andsafety risks to observers during their employment Theconcept ofthisdocument drawsfrom previous guidelines for the development of observer programmes van Helvoort 1986 Davies and Reynolds 2002 and was further developed by the Observer Safety Working group in 2006 at the 5th InternationalFisheries Observer ConferenceMcVea and Kennelly 2007 National Marine Fisheries Service 2007a bObserver programmes are encouraged to apply this CCROPHS to the maximum extent in order to advance health and safety training and increase health

WCPFC12-2015-OP07,7,In the WCPFC Convention Area IPNLF together with our partner Asosiasi Perikanan Pole Line Dan Handline Indonesia AP2HI is working to improve several aspects of the onebyone fisheries in Indonesia Some of the projects we are involved in include improvements in monitoring of catch effort and vulnerable species interactions supporting the development of a tuna harvest strategy and management plan improvements in compliance deployment of onboard observers and establishing a registry of vessels
WCPFC12-2015-OP07,8,Furthermore recent IPNLFsupported workshops have allowed greater outreach with Indonesian fisheries managers processors and fishers and have resulted in the improved understanding of the precautionary approach training on livebait handling and storage and protection of critical habitats Drawing on our network of international experts and working with AP2HIs 18 member companies and their fishers our goal is to improve the sustainability quality and profitability of onebyone tuna catches throughout Indonesia At this years Commission meeting IPNLF encourages members cooperating nonmembers and participating territories CCMs collectively to adopt a number of conservation and management measures CMMs that together will strengthen the framework for sustainable tuna fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean Specifically we urge progress in the following areas Establishment of reference points and harvest control rules for all major tuna species that aim to avoid adverse impacts on and ensure access to fisheries by subsistence smallscale and artisanal fishers Adoption of rebuilding plans for overfished tuna stocks Improved data acquisition and reporting of catches of target and bycatch species Improved data collection and regulation of fishing gears that negatively impact coastal communities including drifting fish aggregating devices dFADs Adoption of measures that will effectively reduce bycatch and protect endangered threatened or protected species including sharks seabirds cetaceans and turtles The proposals on a harvest strategy workplan and reference points for skipjack tuna and south Pacific albacore tuna are particularly important this year in the face of everincreasing fishing effort If adopted more sustainable management frameworks will benefit every CCM bring positive longterm returns to fishing communities and minimise the risk of future fisheries collapse

WCPFC12-2015-OP07,10,Measures should also be adopted to improve information on the ecosystem impacts of fisheries This includes the impacts of dFADs on fish populations and damage to coastal habitats such as coral reefs from abandoned and lost FADs Bycatch of sharks turtles cetaceans and seabirds are also key ecosystem issues which require continued attention from WCPFC CCMs to ensure measures are both effective and enforceable The Western and Central Pacific Ocean is home to the worlds largest tuna fishery and to the worlds largest poleandline fishery IPNLF would like to see management measures adopted that safeguard tuna stocks and ecosystems so that onebyone fisheries and the social benefits they provide to the communities that depend on them can flourish We will continue to work with our members to strive for the highest environmental and social standards which will reinforce the good work of the Commission We look forward to working with all delegations at the 2015 Regular Session in Bali and we are hopeful that the CCMs will find common ground in supporting management improvements Martin Purves Fishery Development Director Andrew Harvey Indonesia Country Director Adam Baske Advisor Policy and Advocacy

WCPFC12-2015-OP08,4,Paper by The PEW Charitable Trusts
WCPFC12-2015-OP08,5,Overview The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC has a mandate to manage all highly migratory fish stocks including tuna and sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean Despite strong scientific and management advice to the Commission the conservation and management measures CMMs now in place are inadequate to end or prevent overfishing of some stocks Although some progress has been made on the conservation and management of sharks much more is needed to guarantee that unsustainable shark fishing does not occur Ensuring healthy fisheries requires strong conservation and management actions and strict compliance The Pew Charitable Trusts urges all Commission Members Cooperating NonMembers and Participating Territories known collectively as CCMsto cooperate in order to Adopt timelines to develop and implement harvest strategies for tunas Rebuild the Pacific bluefin tuna population End bigeye tuna overfishing and effectively manage fish aggregating devices FADs Refine current management measures to reduce shark mortality in fisheries targeting other species Develop a comprehensive list of requirements for shark management plans Prohibit retention of mobulid rays and adopt live release guidance Enact measures to improve data collection for key shark species Adopt minimum standards for port inspections Enhance the effectiveness of the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels and the Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU Fishing Vessel List Ban transshipment at sea Strengthen the Commission compliance monitoring scheme and provide greater transparency Recommendations to the 12th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission8 December 2015 Bali Indonesia A brief from End overfishing rebuild overfished stocks and implement sustainable management of tunas Fishing pressure continues to increase in the Western and Central Pacific In 2014 the overall catch of tuna in WCPFC waters was the highest on record more than 28 million metric tons representing 60 per cent of the global tuna catch In addition the catch of skipjack and yellowfin reached alltime highs The overall catch by purse seine vessels was also the highest on record with a skipjack haul 6 percent bigger than the previous record in 2013 With Pacific bluefin and bigeye tunas both overfished it is clear that fishery management actions to date are insufficient Factors driving these increased catches include the longterm trend toward greater fishing capacity as well as greater technological capability and the more efficient use of drifting FADs humanmade objects that attract fish The use of FADs has led to more tuna being caught in a fishing day and CCMs have not sufficiently addressed the impact of these devices particularly on the catch of juvenile bigeye tuna CCMs have committed to ensuring the longterm conservation and sustainable use of tuna stocks In doing so they agreed to set reference points for tuna species apply the precautionary approach and take measures to prevent or eliminate overfishing among other actions Because they have not yet taken these actions stocks continue to experience overfishing or approach the limits of sustainability As a matter of urgency CCMs must cooperate and compromise on basic management immediately to end overfishing and ensure sustainable management of stocks in the Convention Area Adopt timelines to develop and implement harvest strategies for tunas Last year CCMs took a significant step forward by adopting measure CMM 201406 In that measure they committed to developing and implementing a sixpart harvest strategy approach for each of the key tuna fisheries or stocks to ensure that Commission objectives are met and prevent biological limits from being exceeded The measure requires the Commission to agree no later than this years annual meeting on a workplan that contains an indicative time frame for adoption of harvest strategies Earlier this year the Scientific Committee reviewed a draft workplan for four tuna speciesskipjack yellowfin bigeye and South Pacific albacoreand strongly supported its continued development As an element of the harvest strategy approach the Parties to the Nauru Agreement and the New Zealand territory of Tokelau have proposed a target reference point for skipjack equivalent to twice the biomass that would produce maximum sustainable yield The Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency FFA has proposed a target reference point for South Pacific albacore that is greater than maximum sustainable yield Pew strongly supports adoption of both of these target reference points to ensure the sustainability of these key stocks Given the increasing threats to the sustainability of tuna populations the WCPFC should adopt a harvest strategy workplan with timelines for reaching agreement on management objectives reference points and harvest control rules as quickly as possible but no later than 2018 As a first step the WCPFC should adopt the proposed skipjack and South Pacific albacore target reference points this year Rebuild the Pacific bluefin tuna population Urgent action is needed to reverse the declining stock status of Pacific bluefin The 2014 stock assessment update conducted by the International Scientific Committee confirmed that decades of overfishing have severely depleted the population to 4 percent of its unfished biomass In 2015 an analysis by Japans National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries concluded that even with full implementation of existing conservation measures the Pacific bluefin population will continue to decline through 2018 The analysis found that over the next decade there is a 1 in 3 chance that this population will drop to the lowest level ever recorded CMM 201406 requires the Northern Committee to develop and recommend a workplan and indicative time frames for a harvest strategy for Pacific bluefin by no later than the Committees 2015 meeting Despite that direction the parties did not reach agreement on either at the Northern Committee meeting recently held in Sapporo Japan That means they have not met the measures requirements which are a high priority due to the fragile state of the population At this point the Northern Committees lack of response could irreversibly jeopardize the Pacific bluefin recovery1 The full WCPFC must take a more proactive role in overseeing the Northern Committee and the management and conservation of Pacific bluefin tuna The WCPFC should directly task the Northern Committee with developing by the Committees 2016 meeting a workplan for Pacific bluefin that will return the population to a level capable of producing maximum sustainable yield by 2030 End bigeye tuna overfishing and effectively manage fish aggregating devices FADs Pacific bigeye tuna is overfished and overfishing has occurred for many years beginning before the Commission was established The status of the stock continues to worsen despite clear scientific advice to reduce bigeye mortality The 2014 assessment found that the stock had declined to 16 per cent of its unfished size and the Masa UshiodaSeaPicscom Skipjack tuna Scientific Committee recommended reducing overall fishing mortality by 36 per cent from 20082011 levels Even with updated scientific data that show the stocks continued decline the Commission last year failed to act to improve its status This year the WCPFC has new information that proves the urgent need to improve bigeye management a sensitivity analysis of the stock assessment reaffirming the dire status of bigeye and an increase of 5 per cent in the overall catch of bigeye in 2014 Given that catches of bigeye are not yet being reduced to the levels recommended by the Scientific Committee2 the WCPFC needs to strengthen the tropical tuna conservation measure CMM 201401 Currently the measure is not meeting its goal of ending overfishing by the end of 2017 by reducing catch in the FAD purse seine fishery and by major longline fleets Nearly all of the bigeye harvested by purse seiners are juvenile fish caught on FADs The goal of Commission ordered FAD closures was to reduce the number of FAD sets and by doing so to reduce bigeye mortality However although the WCPFC doubled the closure period from two months in 2009 to four months starting in more bigeye are being caught in the purse seine fishery than in earlier years 67367 metric tons in 2014 compared with 57906 in 2009 The number of FAD sets in 2014 was the thirdhighest on record well above a benchmark level previously recommended by the Scientific Committee Technical changes to improve implementation and compliance with the FAD closure will not be enough to generate real reductions in bigeye mortality to protect this billiondollar fishery Given the increasing fishing pressure on bigeye tuna and the poor status of the stock the WCPFC should immediately reduce bigeye mortality and replace ineffective FAD closure periods with measures that directly control the catch in the purse seine fishery such as FAD set limits or quotas The WCPFC should task the FAD Working Group established last year to provide advice on structuring and implementing such measures Strengthen conservation and management of sharks Every year about 100 million sharks an unsustainable number are caught and killed in commercial fisheries3 Regardless of whether this catch is highly sought after or unintended and unwanted managers must take immediate action to counter declining shark populations and mitigate the damage it causes to marine ecosystems Until measures are in place to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of sharks is sustainable their capture with fishing gear should be avoided and they should be released alive whenever possible Fishing gear that increases the likelihood of shark catch such as wire leaders and shark lines should be prohibited and research should be undertaken to determine the best means of avoiding shark catch If WCPFC Members are to continue to target sharks or to retain sharks caught as bycatch then management measures must be enacted that reflect the precautionary principle Such measures would ensure that all sharks in the Convention Area are sustainably caught and that WCPFC fisheries are not contributing to the global overfishing of sharks Refine current management measures in order to reduce shark mortality in fisheries targeting other species The Scientific Committee this year highlighted concerns about the effectiveness of and compliance with existing shark conservation management measures Although CMM 201405 is an important step in reducing shark mortality giving CCMs a choice to use either wire trace or shark lines does not do enough to reduce overall shark mortality at the rate needed to ensure that catches are sustainable Under current rules CCMs may simply ban the gear that is not commonly used by their fleets and the targeting of sharks can continue without effective management The recommendation by the Scientific Committee SC11 to ban both wire trace and shark lines would be a stronger and more robust approach to reducing the mortality of vulnerable shark species Prohibiting both gears in fisheries that do not target sharks would reduce bycatch of species such as oceanic whitetip and silky sharks which suffer mortality even though their retention is prohibited This year the WCPFC should adopt an updated CMM that prohibits the use of wire leaders and shark lines in fisheries targeting other species Develop a comprehensive list of requirements for shark management plans Under CMM 201405 CCMs must develop management plans for fisheries that target sharks as part of other WCPFC fisheries Although this measure is important to ensuring sustainable stocks it provides little guidance on what the plans should include To ensure that sharks are not overfished shark management plans should contain a comprehensive list of requirements not just a minimum set The WCPFC also must properly define a targeted fishery to ensure that all shark catch is properly managed The WCPFC should develop a clear definition of a targeted shark fishery a comprehensive list of requirements for all shark management plans and guidelines for how the management plans will be reviewed Prohibit retention of mobulid rays and adopt live release guidance The family Mobulidae which includes manta rays and mobula rays are extremely vulnerable to overfishing and are caught as bycatch in tuna purse seine fisheries Observer reports show that manta and mobula rays are often killed as bycatch in WCPFC purse seine fisheries 284 metric tons were recorded from 1994 to 20094 In 2015 the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission prohibited retention of mobulid rays and approved recommendations on how best to release these rays alive when they are caught incidentally The WCPFC should adopt a similar measure to ensure that these species are protected throughout the Pacific Because of the vulnerability of these rays the WCPFC should prohibit retention of all mobulid species and adopt live release guidance Enact measures to improve data collection for key shark species Getting accurate assessments of the status of shark stocks in the western and central Pacific remains difficult because of limited data recording and reporting on the catch of shark species Such information gaps inhibit development of comprehensive scientific advice The WCPFC should adopt a no data no fish measure for sharks similar to one put in place by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas Such a policy would improve data collection by prohibiting CCMs from retaining or landing any of 14 key shark species identified by the Commission if they have not submitted landing data on any catch of that species from the previous year Enhance CCMs transparency and accountability As in other parts of the world illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing remains a threat in the WCPFC Convention Area The Commission has taken important steps to improve compliance with its management measures but the WCPFC cannot do its job effectively unless it requires complete transparency from all CCMs and imposes serious consequences for any lack of compliance with these requirements Adopt minimum standards for port inspections Port State Measures PSMs are costeffective tools to monitor compliance with management arrangements and prevent illegally caught fish from entering the market In 2013 the WCPFC Performance Review recommended that a new CMM on port State measures be adopted and implemented within the Convention Area at the earliest opportunity The review acknowledged that the WCPFC is lagging behind other regional fisheries management organizations in adopting port State measures5 In 2013 and 2014 the Commission considered a proposal from FFA for a CMM on Port State Measures to Prevent Deter and Eliminate IUU fishing which provided minimum standards for port inspections with regard for the special requirements of Small Island Developing States and Participating Territories This proposal reflected a compromise among CCMs positions and offered a good basis for progress towards a regional scheme Unfortunately the proposal did not receive support from all CCMs Pew hopes that such a proposal can be reconsidered and adopted at the upcoming Commission meeting To help monitor compliance and prevent illegal fish from entering the market the WCPFC should adopt a CMM on Port State Measures Enhance the effectiveness of the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels and the IUU Vessel List On 1 January 2016 CMM 201310 requiring the mandatory use of International Maritime Organization IMO numbers for large WCPFC vessels enters into force CCMs must ensure their vessels timely compliance with this requirement In addition to increase the transparency of fishing operations relevant vessel information such as any administrative or judicial actions should be included in the Record of Fishing Vessels The WCPFC should require that CCMs provide to the Secretariat public information on any final administrative or judicial action taken in cases of noncompliance with fisheries regulations by their flagged vessels that are listed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels This requirement would apply to all flagged vessels that operate in the Convention Area in waters beyond their national jurisdiction Such public information should be provided as soon as possible and be published as part of the Record of Fishing Vessels Such pioneering transparency would showcase the efforts of CCMs and the WCPFC Secretariat to foster greater compliance To enhance the effectiveness of the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels the WCPFC should require by 1 January submission of actions taken in cases of noncompliance Placing vessels found to have fished illegally on the WCPFCs IUU vessel list highlights and helps deter unacceptable practices in the Convention Area Current rules however allow IUU vessels to be added to the list only once a year diminishing the effectiveness of the listing As a result IUU vessels operate unhindered until the Commission acts at its annual meeting to place new vessels on the list The WCPFC has already established a procedure that permits removing vessels from the IUU vessel list between meetings It should amend its procedures to allow vessels to be listed between sessions as well The WCPFC should establish a procedure that permits the listing of IUU vessels at times other than its annual meeting Ban transshipment at sea Transshipment at sea continues to provide opportunities for illegal fishers to avoid proper catch reporting and to launder illicitly caught fish The WCPFC should introduce a ban on all forms of transshipment at sea until it can be assured that transshipment operations do not contribute to IUU fishing This would require a robust monitoring system that ensures full transparency including observers andor fisheries officers on board both the offloading and receiving vessels and notification of all transshipment operations occurring at sea in the Convention Area The WCPFC should ban transshipment at sea until the Commission can be assured through proper and effective monitoring that transshipment operations cannot facilitate IUU fishing Strengthen the Commission compliance monitoring scheme and provide greater transparency Article 23 of the Convention obliges Members of the Commission to the greatest extent possible to take measures to ensure that their nationals and fishing vessels owned or controlled by their nationals comply with Convention provisions Likewise Article 246 requires Members to take the necessary measures to ensure that fishing vessels flying their flags comply with Convention provisions and CMMs The joint meeting of tuna regional fisheries management organizations in 2009 recommended that the organizations develop robust compliance review mechanisms so that the records of each Party could be examined in depth on an annual basis7 As a result the WCPFC established a Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS to ensure that CCMs comply with their obligations The CMS is designed to assess CCMs compliance and identify areas where technical assistance or capacity building may be needed to help boost compliance and identify aspects of conservation and management measures that may require refinement or amendment for effective implementation In establishing the compliance monitoring scheme CCMs said the process would be conducted in a responsible open transparent and nondiscriminatory manner so that the Commission could be made aware of all available information relevant to its work in identifying instances of noncompliance and holding parties accountable This year the WCPFC should again take steps to refine the CMS to increase its effectiveness in identifying and holding CCMs accountable for instances of noncompliance The scheme should be able to respond to non compliance with a range of options that take into account the reason for and degree of noncompliance It should include cooperative capacitybuilding initiatives and in cases of serious noncompliance allow for penalties and other actions that promote compliance and include methods to monitor and resolve outstanding instances of non compliance To help meet transparency requirements detailed in Article 21 of the Convention and Rule 15 of the Rules of Procedures it also should allow observer access to Compliance Monitoring Review discussions related to development of both Provisional and Final Compliance Monitoring Reports The WCPFC should consider making the CMS a permanent CMM and improve transparency by allowing observer access to Compliance Monitoring Review discussions related to development of Compliance Monitoring Reports Endnotes The current rebuilding target equates to just 69 percent of unfished levels The Northern Committee is attempting to restrict the scientific analyses conducted as part of the 2016 assessment In 2015 the Scientific Committee reiterated its advice from 2014 A 36 percent reduction in fishing mortality from the average levels for 2011 would be expected to return the fishing mortality rate to FMSY and allow the stock to rebuild above the limit reference point Boris Worm et al Global Catches Exploitation Rates and Rebuilding Options for Sharks Marine Policy 40 2013 194204 http

WCPFC12-2015-OP15,9,Yours sincerely
WCPFC12-2015-OP15,10,Guillermo Compen Director STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE IATTC Considering the need to respectfully express during the 12th regular session of the WCPFC some of the principal reasons behind the exhortation sent by the IATTC to this organization with the aim of seeking within the bounds of feasibility the unification of some management strategies for the tuna fisheries in the entire Pacific Ocean I would indicate the following The IATTC carries out extensive work in the field of scientific research on the assessment of the stocks of tunas and tunalike species in the eastern Pacific Ocean seeking constantly to propose to its Members a variety of management strategies and measures for the different tuna fisheries with the aim of maintaining catch levels within the range of maximum sustainable yields On the basis of this process the IATTC has determined that the best actions adopted to date for achieving the objective of sustainability in the fisheries for tropical tunas are the following a Strict control since 2002 of the carrying capacity of the purseseine fleet in the IATTC Convention Area by means of a Regional Vessel Register and the establishment of maximum limits to that capacity b A mechanism of total closure for the purseseine fleet for 62 days each year which has increased progressively since its initial duration of 30 days c A 30day closure in an area known as the corralito where the presence of juvenile bigeye tuna occurs with the greatest frequency These three measures together with the establishment of a permanent onboard observer program for all purseseine vessels with carrying capacities greater than 363 tonnes have helped us improve significantly the monitoring of compliance with resolutions and measures adopted by the IATTC as well as obtain the information necessary for the ongoing stock assessments carried out by the IATTC scientific staff With this wide experience and motivated by the worldwide concern regarding possible levels of overexploitation of some species of tunas such as bluefin bigeye and yellowfin in the entire Pacific Ocean we seek to increase the coordination between our two organizations This led to the IATTC at its last ordinary meeting held in July of this year in Guayaquil Ecuador deciding to send a respectful exhortation to the WCPFC to consider the following at its annual meeting in To strengthen cooperation with the IATTC in the scientific areas in order to improve their work dynamic jointly using similar assessment models for analyzing the status of all the shared stocks of tropical tunas in the Pacific Ocean as a whole To identify differences in characteristics and structure of purseseine operation and stock dynamics in the Central and Western Pacific and Eastern Pacific To develop management measures such as a total closure of catches for the purseseine fishery for skipjack bigeye and yellowfin tunas whereby the operation of the fleets is totally stopped in order to achieve greater efficiency of the measures for the sustainability of these species throughout the Pacific Ocean The number and timing of days of closure should be based on the best available science The WCPFC could consider making appropriate adjustments to other existing conservation and management measures if a total closure is adopted To work in the development of a coordinated rebuilding and management plan for the bluefin tuna stock The IATTC shall ask the WCPFC for a joint meeting with all interested parties after the stock assessment by the ISC is carried out in 2016 in order to adopt equivalent points of reference
WCPFC12-2015-OP15,11,In an scenario that is ever more complex due to the increase in capacity for catching tunas without a clear maximum limit which consequently generates an increase in fishing effort and greater pressure on the populations of these species we believe that it is necessary to analyze as a priority the adoption of measures such as total closures in the Pacific Ocean as a whole We value positively the work that has been carried out between our two regional organizations at the level of scientific exchange on assessment models but we consider that now is the time to take a fundamental step towards establishing joint management strategies for the tuna populations that we share avoiding through appropriate responsibility that the fisheries administered by the two organizations be considered to be below suitable limits of sustainability This statement is made in the framework of a strict and respectful strategic cooperation between the two organizations whose objectives are of equal range and impact in the Pacific Ocean Thank you very much to all of you for your kind attention

WCPFC12-2015-OP15,14,Considerando la necesidad de expresar respetuosamente durante la 12 sesin ordinaria de la WCPFC algunos de los principales motivos relacionados al exhorto enviado por la CIAT a esta organizacin con la finalidad de buscar en lo que sea factible la unificacin de algunas estrategias para el ordenamiento de las pesqueras de atunes en todo el Ocano Pacfico me permito indicar lo siguiente La CIAT realiza un extenso trabajo en el campo de la investigacin cientfica sobre la evaluacin de las poblaciones de atunes y especies afines en el Ocano Pacfico Oriental buscando constantemente proponer a sus Miembros una variedad de estrategias y medidas de ordenamiento respecto a las diferentes pesqueras de atunes con la finalidad de mantener los niveles de captura dentro de los rangos de los mximos rendimientos sostenibles
WCPFC12-2015-OP15,15,En base a este proceso la CIAT ha podido determinar que las mejores acciones adoptadas hasta los actuales momentos para lograr los objetivos de sostenibilidad en las pesqueras de atunes tropicales son las siguientes a Estricto control desde 2002 de la capacidad de acarreo de la flota de cerco en el rea de la Convencin de la CIAT mediante el Registro Regional de Buques y el establecimiento de lmites mximos de esa capacidad b Un mecanismo de veda total para la flota de cerco por 62 das cada ao la cual ha venido creciendo progresivamente desde su duracin inicial de 30 das c Una veda anual de 30 das en un rea denominada corralito donde ocurre con mayor frecuencia la presencia de atunes patudo juveniles Estas tres medidas junto al establecimiento de un programa permanente de observadores a bordo en todos los barcos cerqueros con capacidad de acarreo mayor a 363 toneladas nos han ayudado de forma significativa a mejorar el monitoreo del cumplimiento de las resoluciones y medidas adoptadas por la CIAT as como obtener la informacin necesaria para las evaluaciones que realiza seguidamente el personal cientfico de la CIAT Con esta amplia experiencia y motivados por la preocupacin mundial respecto a los posibles niveles de sobreexplotacin de algunas especies de atunes como el aleta azul patudo y aleta amarilla en todo el Ocano Pacfico buscamos aumentar la coordinacin entre nuestras dos organizaciones lo cual motiv que la CIAT en su ltima reunin ordinaria realizada en julio del presente ao en Guayaquil
WCPFC12-2015-OP15,16,Ecuador decidiera enviar un exhorto respetuoso a la WCPFC para que en su reunin anual del presente ao considere lo siguiente Fortalecer la cooperacin con la CIAT en el mbito cientfico para incrementar su dinmica de trabajo en conjunto usando modelos de evaluacin similares para analizar ntegramente el estado de todas las poblaciones compartidas de atunes tropicales del Ocano Pacfico Identificar diferencias en las caractersticas y estructura de la operacin de la flota atunera de cerco y las dinmicas de las poblaciones de atunes en el Ocano Pacfico Occidental Central y Oriental Desarrollar medidas de ordenacin como vedas totales en la pesca de cerco para las especies barrilete aleta amarilla y patudo en las que se paraliza totalmente la operacin de las flotas a fin de lograr una mayor eficiencia de las medidas para la sostenibilidad de estas especies a lo largo del Ocano Pacfico El nmero de das y las pocas de veda debern basarse en la mejor informacin cientfica disponible La WCPFC podra considerar realizar ajustes adecuados en otras medidas de manejo y conservacin existentes si una veda total fuese adoptada Trabajar en el desarrollo de una reconstruccin coordinada y un plan de gestin para la poblacin de aleta azul del Pacfico La CIAT deber solicitar a la WCPFC tener una reunin conjunta con las partes interesadas despus de la evaluacin de la poblacin por el ISC en el ao 2016 para adoptar puntos de referencia equivalentes
WCPFC12-2015-OP15,17,En un escenario cada vez ms complejo por los aumentos de las capacidades para capturas de atunes sin un claro lmite mximo lo que por consecuencia genera un aumento del esfuerzo pesquero y mayor presin sobre las poblaciones de estas especies creemos que se hace necesario analizar con prioridad la adopcin de medidas como vedas totales en conjunto en el Ocano Pacfico
WCPFC12-2015-OP15,18,Valoramos positivamente el trabajo que se viene ejecutando entre nuestras dos organizaciones regionales a nivel del intercambio cientfico sobre los modelos de evaluacin pero consideramos que es el momento de dar un paso fundamental hacia establecer estrategias conjuntas de ordenamiento en las poblaciones de atunes que son compartidas evitando con una acertada responsabilidad que las pesqueras administradas por las dos organizaciones sean consideradas por debajo de los lmites adecuados de sostenibilidad
WCPFC12-2015-OP15,19,Esta declaracin se realiza en el marco de una estricta y respetuosa cooperacin estratgica entre las dos organizaciones cuyos objetivos son de igual dimensin e impacto en el Ocano Pacfico
WCPFC12-2015-OP15,20,Muchas gracias a todos por su gentil atencin

WCPFC12-2015-OP16,2,Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Twelfth Regular Session of the Commission WCPFC12 Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015
WCPFC12-2015-OP16,3,Greenpeace welcomes the opportunity to attend the 12th meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC as an observer The outcome of the recent WCPFC Science Committee meeting in particular the overfishing occurring on the bigeye Pacific bluefin stocks and decline in southern albacore is the predictable result of the failure of members of this Commission to uphold the mandate stipulated under Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention to apply the precautionary approach including through acting upon the best available scientific advice in adopting conservation and management measures CMMs for key tuna species
WCPFC12-2015-OP16,4,The continued decline in these stocks is a result of continued expansion of fishing fleets increasing fishing capacity and effort through the use of FADs in particular and increasing noncompliance Two of the Pacifics vital tuna stocks are now at dangerously low levels the Pacific bluefin tuna population is estimated to be at 43 and bigeye tuna at 16 of its original spawning biomass The Commission must prioritise efforts towards rebuilding these stocks and putting in place all the necessary management frameworks and control mechanisms to safeguard them from further decline The Commission must develop precautionary targets and harvest control rules to restore all the fisheries to full health and productivity
WCPFC12-2015-OP16,5,Greenpeace therefore calls on the members of the WCPFC to urgently adopt the following measures Agree a new recovery plan for bigeye tuna that brings existing fishing capacity and effort into line with precautionary mortality limits to end overfishing and allow for the quickest possible recovery of the stock Greenpeace believes that in order to achieve such objectives a full ban on the use of FADs a reduction in longline effort and the closure of the high seas pockets to all tuna fishing is required Adopt a Conservation and Management Measure for South Pacific albacore that sets the basis for reducing capacity in the fishery and puts catches in line with precautionary mortality levels Greenpeace believes such measures must ensure that both fishing capacity and catches are brought down to biologically and economically sustainable levels Greenpeace recommends that in agreeing the necessary reduction in total catches in the albacore fishery priority should be given to reducing fishing opportunities available to CCMs that are not complying with data provision requirements Adopt a full ban on at sea transhipment Transshipment at sea is a tool that facilitates IUU fishing activity as has been documented by Greenpeace in the Pacific tuna fishing grounds from 2006 20151 ship expeditions Atsea transshipment is already banned for purse seine fleets and Pacific Island countries have made progress to shut down this sketchy practice in longline fleets Most recently the government of Nauru announced a ban on transshipment in its waters in September 2015 after the Greenpeace bust of Shuen De Ching No 8882 a Expedition reports available upon request from Greenpeace httpgrnpcorgShuenDeChingNo888sharkevidence For further information Lagi Toribau

WCPFC12-2015-OP16,9,Taiwanese longliner engaged in illegal fishing shark finning3 and transshipment on the high seas Transshipment and the use of motherships to resupply fishing vessels at sea also facilitates forced labour and human rights abuse at sea by allowing fishing vessels to stay at sea for months and even years making escape impossible for fishing crews It also exacerbates the extremely low level of observer coverage on longline vessels by making observer trips difficult to implement and allowing longline vessels to avoid port inspection from landing catches in port or transshipping in authorised transshipment ports where inspection is possible The impacts of transshipment at sea are clear and as a result tuna traders and consumers cannot be sure that their longline tuna is caught legally and without the use of forced labour The commission must live up to its obligation to adopt compatible measures for the high seas and follow Pacific Islands and Indonesias lead in EEZ transshipment bans by adopting a ban on transshipment at sea across the full convention area Adopt a moratorium on targeted fishing for Pacific bluefin tuna Given the dire state of the Pacific bluefin tuna population it is a matter of urgency that the Commission agrees to a moratorium on all targeted fishing for Pacific bluefin tuna until such time that a Pacificwide management plan is agreed and implemented and the stock has shown conclusive evidence of recovery to levels above an agreed biomass limit reference point Adopt interim target reference points TRPs of 50 SB for skipjack bigeye and yellowfin and 45 for albacore until final TRPs are agreed by the Commission by 2017 Strengthening the current shark finning measure CMM 201405 to prohibit both methods of shark targeting wire leaders and shark lines beneath buoys The use of shark lines is difficult to verify unless vessels are witnessed retrieving the lines from beneath buoys so vessels may be violating this measure without detection Strengthen CMM 201007 to require sharks be retained with their fins naturally attached This is international best practise as set out in the UN General Assembly resolution 62177 Enforcing the 5 ratio when fins may be stored detached and even transhipped separately from carcasses is extremely difficult as recently documented by Greenpeace on board the Shuen De Ching 888 vessel This loophole compromises other CMMs including those for oceanic whitetip and silky sharks In addition transhipment of sharks and fins separately is currently allowed under CMM 201007 which compounds the difficulty in enforcing the relevant shark measures This further reiterates the call by Greenpeace to ban all transhipment at sea of all species including sharks to close this loophole and support strong fisheries management good data reporting and science and enforcement of the rules Strengthen the Commissions response to noncompliance and IUU fishing by ensuring that transparency is restored to this process and compliance documents are made available Greenpeace recommends that the annual assessment of obligations is focused on priorities identified using a risk based approach For the 2015 assessment of compliance we suggest prioritising a Failure to provide operational level data b Repeated noncompliance c Violation of the FAD closure period d Exceeding catch and effort limits e Transhipment httpgrnpcorgShuenDeChingNo888sharkevidence

WCPFC13-2016-OP02,1,COMMISSION THIRTEENTH REGULAR SESSION Denarau Island Fiji 9 December 2016 PEW POSITION STATEMENT WCPFC132016OP02 November 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP02,2,Paper by The PEW Charitable Trusts A brief from Dec 2016 Recommendations to the 13th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission9 December 2016 Nadi Fiji Overview The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC has a mandate to sustainably manage and ensure longterm conservation of all highly migratory fish stocks including tunas and sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean However the Commissions handling of some migratory fish stocks currently falls short of that mandate and global expectations of best practices though the WCPFC Convention text incorporates relatively modern principles of fisheries management Despite strong scientific and management advice to the Commission the conservation and management measures CMMs now in place are inadequate to end or prevent overfishing of some key stocks Two of the six commercial tuna stocks managed by WCPFCPacific bluefin and bigeye tunacontinue to be fished unsustainably In addition while some progress has been made on the conservation and management of sharks much more is needed to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of sharks is sustainable Ensuring sustainable fisheries in the WCPFC Convention Area requires strong conservation and management actions and strict compliance with measures already adopted The Pew Charitable Trusts urges all Commission Members Cooperating NonMembers and Participating Territoriesknown collectively as CCMsto cooperate and compromise in order to Adopt elements of the harvest strategy approach that would specify measurable management objectives ensure that the risk of breaching limit reference points is no greater than 10 percent and rebuild Pacific bigeye to its limit reference point within six to eight years Immediately implement a twoyear moratorium on all commercial fishing for Pacific bluefin tuna Effectively manage fish aggregating devices FADs Adopt timely electronic reporting and electronic monitoring standards that meet existing requirements for scientific data provision and compliance Ban transshipment at sea until authorities can ensure that it is verifiable and legal Consider sciencebased catch limits and improve data collection for sharks Implement a complete ban of wire trace and shark lines Ensure that all targeted shark fisheries provide comprehensive management plans Prohibit retention of manta and mobula rays and adopt live release guidance for these species Task a small working group to develop a port State measures CMM that can be considered by the Commission in 2017 Establish a procedure that permits the addition of vessels found to be engaged in illegal unreported and unregulated fishing to the IUU vessel list between annual meetings Improve transparency in Commission processes by allowing observer access to compliance monitoring scheme discussions Recommendations Adopt harvest strategies to protect healthy stocks and rebuild overfished stocks and effectively manage fish aggregating devices Fisheries management in the western and central Pacific must take into consideration the importance of various stocks to the economies of the region and the wellbeing of the marine ecosystem In 2014 catches of tuna in the region totaled about 285 million metric tons with an estimated value of more than US2268 billion at the final point of sale That represents 57 percent of the global tuna catch1 The Commissions current approach to fisheries management is not adequate to preserve that value or the sustainability of the stocks Healthy stocks such as skipjackwhich in 2014 accounted for 68 percent of the catch in the region with a value of 23 billionshould be managed with a longterm view rather than to maximize shortterm gains Meanwhile depleted and overfished stocks of Pacific bluefin and bigeye tuna require urgent action beyond business as usual Ensure the adoption of welldesigned harvest strategies Members of the Commission face important decisions that will determine the degree to which harvest strategies designed in the western and central Pacific are suitably precautionary and promote the longterm sustainability of the stocks Adoption of CMM 201406 two years ago committed the Commission to developing and implementing a sixpart harvest strategy approach for each of the key tuna stocks Last year the Commission followed that decision by adopting a workplan that established timelines for decisionmaking Separately the WCPFC Chair has circulated a concept paper to adopt a bridging CMM for the transition from the tropical tuna measure that expires in 2017 to implementation of harvest strategies Harvest strategies are the next innovation in fisheries management If designed correctly they benefit both the fish and fishermen Reflecting the importance of these stocks the Commission should adhere to the timelines in the harvest strategy workplan to Record2 stockspecific management objectives that set measurable goals including Target reference points should be met with 80 percent or greater likelihood Biological objectives such as maintaining stocks at levels that promote sustainability should be given greater weight than other objectives Adopt acceptable levels of risk of breaching limit reference points that are no more than 10 percent3 and in the case of Pacific bigeye 5 percent to recognize the need to minimize the likelihood these stocks will fall into the danger zone Adopt a timeline to rebuild Pacific bigeye to its limit reference point in six to eight yearsa goal that is achievable given the biological characteristics of the stockas an interim step to rebuilding the stock to a target reference point set to be agreed upon in 2017 Adopt a precautionary target reference point for South Pacific albacore Endorse the concept of a bridging measure to manage the transition from the tropical tuna CMM that expires in 2017 to implementation of harvest strategies Specify a plan to agree on details to be included in the measure Immediately implement a 2year moratorium on all commercial fishing for Pacific bluefin tuna The latest stock assessment for Pacific bluefin tuna released in 2016 found that nearly a century of overfishing has depleted the population to just 26 percent of its historic unfished size Despite this 97 percent decline the CMM recommended by the Northern Committee would not end overfishing or implement key elements of a longterm harvest strategy for the species In fact an addition to the proposed measure would allow the catch of large bluefin to increase despite scientific projections showing that there is a less than 1 percent chance that the population will recover under current management measures The full WCPFC Commission and its members have the ultimate responsibility for fulfilling the Convention mandate to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield In light of the failure of the Northern Committee to recommend a CMM that would meet this mandate the Commission should Not accept the Northern Committee recommendations and return the matter to the Committee for consideration of appropriate management measures that would end overfishing fulfill the mandates of the Convention and CMM 201406 and rebuild the population to healthy levels Implement an initial twoyear moratorium on commercial fishing of Pacific bluefin that would be extended until the Commission Agrees on a recovery plan that will rebuild the population to 20SSBcurrent F0 within eight years two generations time as per best practice and then allows the stock to recover further to a target reference point of at least 40 SBcurrent F0 by 2030 Adopts limit reference points for Pacific bluefin of at least 20SBcurrent F0 and a related Flimit point Limit reference points should be defined as the points at which if breached the fishery will be suspended and scientific monitoring will be instituted until the population returns to the limits Adopts target reference points for Pacific bluefin of at least 40 SBcurrent F0 and a related Ftarget point to provide an appropriate buffer to avoid breaching the limit reference points Adopts harvest control rules that lead to a less than 5 percent chance of breaching the limit reference points and that have at least a 90 percent chance of achieving the target reference points The Pacific bluefin population will not recover under current measures and without additional help If the measures noted above are not in place by 2018 an international trade ban through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES listing should be pursued as the only remaining option to safeguard the species Effectively manage fish aggregating devices Developing measures to effectively manage FADs must be an urgent priority for the Commission and part of a balanced strategy to reduce fishing mortality among juvenile and adult bigeye Nearly all bigeye harvested by purse seine vessels are juvenile fish taken around FADs The impact can be seen in the mortality rate for juveniles which was twice that of adults in the 2014 assessment4 the most recent full assessment for the stock Bigeye mortality decreased in the purse seine fishery in 2015 but the conditions that brought that about were not linked to stock management Oceanographic conditions associated with a strong El Nino may have made bigeye less available in the eastern portion of the Convention Area5 In addition some key purse seine fleets did not fish as much as they had in recent years though they may return to higher levels of effort Still even with the unique circumstances of 2015 scientists estimated that the stock continued to experience overfishing and remained overfished at about 16 percent of its unfished spawning biomass That is below the WCPFC limit reference point of 20 percent of unfished spawning biomass The need to adopt measures to directly reduce and manage juvenile mortality remains urgent With the tropical tuna CMM expiring in 2017 the Commission this year should Review the progress of the FAD Working Group and request further development of management options to directly control the catch of bigeye in the purse seine fishery Those management options should specify clear steps and timelines and lead to a recommendation to the Commissions annual meeting in 2017 Adopt a FAD research plan to inform management decisions which includes analyses of bigeye hot spots and how vessel characteristics influence bigeye catches Agree on a plan to physically mark FADs with unique codes to improve data collection considering the recommendations in the consultants report on FAD marking and identification Adopt electronic reporting and electronic monitoring standards Tuna longline fisheries in the western and central Pacific are not effectively managed today in part because current mechanisms and policies do not ensure sufficient and timely submission of critical data In 2014 longline vessels caught fish with an end value of almost 4 billion in these waters6 Given the economic contributions of that sector of the fishery resource managers should be motivated to ensure its longterm sustainability by addressing gaps in the timely and accurate tracking of longline fishing catch and effort Promising new technologies can make required reporting and monitoring much faster and more effective Information on catches can be relayed in near realtime in more standardized formats using electronic reporting ER systems In addition the WCPFC can expand observer coverage requirements with limited additional onboard personnel by using proven electronic monitoring EM technology Technological advances coupled with the increasing costeffectiveness of ER and EM systems can help improve fisheries management and ensure high levels of compliance with conservation and management measures Near realtime electronic catch reporting improves accountability and accuracy benefiting authorities fishing boat owners and associated industries alike For these reasons and more many WCPFC member countries have already embraced these technologies as effective management tools for their domestic fisheries and more are likely to follow Pew calls on members of the WCPFC to Adopt electronic reporting and electronic monitoring standards that meet existing scientific data provision and compliance requirements to allow interested CCMs to commence reporting electronically in a manner aligned with WCPFC requirements Adopt guidelines on EM program components including steps to ensure that EM coverage equates to coverage under the Regional Observer Program Require 100 percent electronic reporting to improve timeliness and accuracy of catch reporting Adopt strategies and time frames for the design and implementation of electronic reporting and monitoring systems including training programs and how best to ensure longterm operational sustainability Require 100 percent observer coverage on longline vessels as now required on purse seine vessels by complementing onboard human observers with electronic monitoring for science and compliance Ban transshipment at sea until it can be ensured that it does not contribute to IUU activity Illegal unreported and misreported transshipment at sea particularly within the longline sector contributes significantly to IUU activity unless the movement of catch from vessel to vessel is adequately regulated and controlled Within the western and central Pacific Ocean region alone an estimated 142 million a year of tuna and tunalike product is involved in illegal atsea transshipment activities Pew has advocated for regional fishery management organizations RFMOs to ban all forms of atsea transshipment of fish until there is clear evidence that such operations are legal and verifiable and do not contribute to IUU fishing Verification remains difficult Although there is a 100 percent observer coverage requirement on carrier vessels the WCPFC Secretariat does not currently receive reports from carrier observers nor does it maintain a database for this information That means that no cross verification can be done of seafood product reportedly transshipped between vessels on the high seas Data and information on transshipment are collected and relayed to various entities but no single body including the WCPFC Secretariat maintains a full and complete picture of this activity from the point of catch to the point of offloading As such additional controls to ensure full and effective monitoring of transshipments at sea are needed Some RFMOs have banned transshipment at sea for some authorized vessels such as purse seiners or small scale longline vessels demonstrating that such bans are feasible and economically viable WCPFC member countries have championed similar provisions for the longline sector or called for complete transshipment bans but so far the Commission has not been able to implement the measures needed to fully control transshipment at sea Pew calls on members of the WCPFC to Ban transshipment at sea until it can be ensured that it is verifiable and legal Among other actions guidelines should be established to determine the impracticability for certain vessels to operate without being able to transship on the high seas As a first step establish formal observer reporting processes procedures and forms for observers on carrier vessels to ensure that every high seas transshipment reported via declarations can be cross validated by the Secretariat as to species quantity and location Strengthen conservation and management of sharks About 100 million sharks an unsustainable number are caught and killed in commercial fisheries each year7 Whether this catch is highly sought after or unintended and unwanted managers must take immediate action to stop the decline in shark populations and mitigate the damage that causes to marine ecosystems Until measures are in place to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of sharks is sustainable harvest of these animals should be avoided Those caught should be released alive whenever possible Fishing gear that increases the likelihood of shark catch such as wire leaders and shark lines should be prohibited and research should be done to determine the best means of avoiding shark catch If CCMs are to continue to target sharks or to catch sharks as bycatch then the Commission must enact management measures that reflect the precautionary principle In instances where limited population data for shark species result in uncertain stock assessment results managers must implement precautionary measures such as catch limits that can safeguard these vulnerable stocks The Commission also should require that fins be naturally attached when sharks are landed Adopting this global standard would allow for better enforcement of the WCPFC prohibition on shark finning Such measures would ensure that all sharks in the Convention Area are sustainably caught and that WCPFC fisheries are not contributing to the global overfishing of sharks Consider sciencebased catch limits and improve data collection for sharks Stock assessment analyses of shark species are often limited by inadequate datasets which make it more difficult to formulate comprehensive scientific advice For example a limited number of available data sets severely constrained the recent assessment of the South Pacific blue shark As a result at its 2016 meeting the Scientific Committee noted that no management advice could be provided for this stock In order to safeguard blue sharks until a more reliable assessment can be conducted the Commission must implement a precautionary cap of effort at current levels Additionally improvements to data recording and reporting on the catch of shark species will help ensure sustainable fishing of stocks Pew calls on the Commission to Consider capping the fishing effort for blue sharks at current levels Expand observer coverage for longline fleets operating in the Convention Area Consider the adoption of a no data no fish measure for sharks which would prohibit CCMs that do not submit landing data on key shark species from retaining shark catches Prohibit the use of wire trace and shark lines CMM 201308 and CMM 201104 prohibit retention of silky sharks and oceanic whitetip sharks in the Convention Area The Commission implemented these measures to drastically reduce fishing mortality of these highly vulnerable species However a separate measure CMM 201405 allows the choice of using either wire trace or shark lines which undermines these efforts Removing the choice of gear and imposing a ban of both gear types would reduce fishingrelated mortality by 24 percent for silky sharks and 37 percent for oceanic whitetip sharks8 Pew urges the Commission to Implement a complete ban on wire trace and shark lines to reduce catch of silky and oceanic whitetip sharks Ensure that all targeted shark fisheries provide comprehensive management plans Having clearly defined components in a shark management plan can safeguard highly vulnerable stocks and ensure an acceptable level of fishing mortality for all shark species caught Pew urges the Commission to Consider the components of a targeted shark fishery management plan recommended by the Scientific Committee in 2016 and propose a clear timeline for the review of submitted plans Prohibit retention of manta and mobula rays and adopt live release guidance The family Mobulidae which includes manta rays and mobula rays is extremely vulnerable to overfishing Observer reports show that manta and mobula rays are often killed as bycatch in WCPFC purse seine fisheries metric tons were recorded from 1994 to 20099 WCPFC13 should strongly consider the 2016 Scientific Committee advice and recommend that purse seine observer training programs emphasize species identification of Mobulid rays Pew urges the Commission to Consider banning the retention of manta and mobula rays and implement the Scientific Committees 2016 recommendation to adopt guidelines for safe release of such rays when caught incidentally in WCPFC fisheries Enhance CCM transparency and accountability Adopt minimum standards for port inspections Port State measures PSMs are costeffective tools to monitor compliance with management arrangements and prevent illegal fish from entering the market PSM proposals have been considered by the Commission for several years and also were recommended as part of the WCPFC Performance Review in 2013 Recent efforts to adopt a CMM on Port State Measures to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing have fallen short but the entry into force this year of the international Port States Measures Agreement should provide a strong basis for establishing a regional scheme within the WCPFC In addition the Commissions Technical and Compliance Committee this year discussed the paper produced by the Secretariat10 that summarizes measures adopted by other RFMOs The Commission must move toward adopting a formal port State measures CMM Pew urges the Commission to Adopt a port State measures CMM as soon as possible If there is no agreement at the annual meeting task a small working group to develop text on a port State measures CMM that can be considered by the Technical and Compliance Committee in 2017 and formally adopted by the Commission next year Enhance the effectiveness of the IUU vessel list Placing a vessel on WCPFCs IUU vessel list helps to highlight and ultimately deter unacceptable practices in the Convention Area However the effectiveness of this list is diminished because vessels found to be engaged in IUU fishing can only be added once a year As a result IUU vessels operate unhindered until the Commission meets and CCMs put them on the list The WCPFC permits vessels to be removed from the IUU vessel list between annual meetings In the same spirit the Commission should permit the listing of IUU vessels intersessionally Pew calls on members of the WCPFC to Establish a procedure that permits the addition of vessels found to be engaged in IUU fishing to the IUU vessel list between annual meetings Compliance monitoring scheme and transparency The Second Joint Meeting of Tuna RFMOs in 2009 recommended that organizations develop robust compliance review mechanisms so that the records of each member of the Commission could be examined on an annual basis As a result the WCPFC established a Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS to ensure that CCMs meet their obligations The CMS is designed to assess CCM compliance It also helps identify areas where technical assistance or capacity building may be needed and determine aspects of conservation and management measures that require refinement or amendment for effective implementation When establishing the Compliance Monitoring Scheme CCMs said the process would be conducted in a responsible open transparent and nondiscriminatory manner Such a process would ensure that the Commission was aware of information relevant to efforts to identify instances of noncompliance and hold parties accountable To help meet transparency requirements detailed in Article 21 of the Convention and Rule of the Rules of Procedures the Commission should allow observer access to Compliance Monitoring Review discussions related to development of both Provisional and Final Compliance Monitoring Reports Pew urges the Commission to Improve transparency by formally adopting a process that will allow observer access to all discussions about the

WCPFC13-2016-OP03,2,Paper by The World Wide Fund for Nature WWF th Regular Session of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC13 Nadi Fiji December 59 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP03,3,The World Wide Fund for Nature WWF would like to again thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC for the opportunity to attend the 13th Regular Session as an observer and to address the critically important role that it plays in the proper management of the Western Central Pacific Ocean WCPO fisheries WWF once again calls on members of the WCPFC to address the issues and recommendations raised at SC12 TCC12 and WCPFC12 as well as observe the experience of other RFMOs in their own efforts to achieve and maintain improved measures for monitoring and surveillance WWF would like to note that this Position Statement is not comprehensive but that fact does not mean that WWF does not think that other issues not included herein are not important WWF wishes to reiterate its position offered in Bali Indonesia in December 2015 WCPFC12 and taking into account the WCPFCrelated meetings held since the recommendations listed below as well as other documents submitted to the WCPFC for review as Observer Papers WWF remains supportive of the work of the WCPFC and subsidiary bodies in pursuing the implementation of a Harvest Strategy HS approach as agreed under CMM 201406 Conservation and Management Measures to develop and implement a harvest strategy approach for key fisheries and stocks in the WCPO1 and Supplementary Information on Workplan for the adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 201406 the Workplan2 Consistent with previous WWF position statements and recommendations WWF continues to encourage WCPFC13 to further endorse and support the adoption of explicit Limit and Target Reference Points LRPTRP HCRs and HSs for all Gregg Yan WWF
WCPFC13-2016-OP03,4,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 13th Regular Session Nadi Fiji 59 December 2016 fishery stocks under WCPFC authority To that end WWF strongly encourages WCPFC13 to meet or exceed the deadlines proposed for specific measures under the Workplan WWF commends the adoption of a conservative bioeconomic TRP for skipjack at WCPFC12 Consistent with the precedent demonstrated by setting a bioeconomic TRP for skipjack WWF encourages the adoption of a similar conservative bioeconomic TRP for South Pacific albacore in accordance with the recommendation and supporting analysis provided by the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency FFA WWF also strongly supports further consideration and development of a welldefined HCR for the PNA skipjack fishery that ensures absolute compatibility throughout the entirety of the WCPFC CA and avoids a disproportionate burden on the Small Island Developing States SIDS WWF notes the continuing strong support for these important management measures specifically the adoption of TRPs and HCRs for the key target species WWF recommends that the WCPFC Support and endorse further implementation of CMM 201406 on Establishing a Harvest Strategy for Key Tuna Species in the WCPO consistent with proposed timelines including o Record the Management Objectives for all stocks under the Workplan o Agree acceptable levels of risk for all stocks under the Workplan o Agree to timelines to rebuild the bigeye tuna BET stock to the LRP o Agree to a monitoring strategy to assess performance against reference points for SP Albacore SP ALB and skipjack SKJ o Endorse further HCR development and implementation for the SKJ PS fishery and o Endorse the FFA TRP proposal for the SP ALB LL fishery Support the continued development and implementation of LRPs and TRPs as a priority for proper management of all stocks including sharks and Support development and implementation of interim precautionary TRPs for BET and YFT Many shark species in the WCPO remain subject to high levels of fishing mortality that current stock assessment trends suggest could be unsustainable3 Sharks play a critical role in the WCPO marine ecosystem as apex predators and indicators of ecosystem health4 WWF is concerned with shark conservation and sustainability in the WCPFC region as a whole and considers responsible management trade and consumption where shark mortality occurs in all fishing activities not just in circumstances where tuna fishing is occurring Therefore WCPFC must also recognise the needs of coastal States in the WCPFC region to manage their shark populations Although WWF supports the previous minor action taken by the WCPFC in CMM 201405 Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks5 WWF continues to support recommendations made previously by the SC and drawn from the discussion regarding a proposed comprehensive and integrated shark CMM6 By way of reference we again endorse the recommendations contained in sections 41 and 42 of the paper previously presented by Dr Shelley Clarke in addition to measures recommended below7 Furthermore WWF endorses the recent action taken by the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC to support best practices for safe handling and release manta rays genus Mobula and Manta aboard purse seiners WWF encourages the WCPFC to pursue equivalent or consistent measures for mobula and manta rays in the WCPFC
WCPFC13-2016-OP03,5,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 13th Regular Session Nadi Fiji 59 December 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP03,6,Reports from the WCPFC Technical and Compliance Committee TCC12 indicated that finning is still rife within WCPO waters with many CCMs failing to comply with existing shark CMMs It is imperative that action is taken to end the wasteful practice of shark finning and associated lack of accounting of shark mortality that results In October this year silky sharks three species of thresher sharks and all nine species of mobula rays were included within Appendix II of CITES which places a greater emphasis on RFMOs to ensure catches are reported accurately to meet CITES reporting obligations WWF recommends the WCPFC Develop endorse and recommend adoption of a Comprehensive Shark CMM that includes efforts to o Mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs o Implement the recommendations for bycatch that were endorsed at Kobe III and adopt an annually updated report card system against these recommendations for all of the WCPFC fisheries o Require through data collected from observer programs and other means estimation of the number of captures and releases of all sharks and rays including the status upon release dead or alive and reporting of this information to the WCPFC o Review and amend CMM 201405 to prohibit vessels carrying wire trace and the use branch lines and o Require through observer programs recording what gear is used in longline activities including the use of wire traces and any multi monofilament traces in order to avoid biteoff by sharks Provide definitions for mobula and manta rays to be considered as a key shark species Encourage the development of reference points and management for nontarget species including all shark and ray species as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention CCMs fully support proposals to land sharks with fins naturally attached as the only way to ensure shark finning does not occur and Encourage CCMs to report all shark and ray catches from domestic fleets operating in territorial and archipelagic waters to assist CCMs to meet obligations for shark and ray species incorporated under CITES Appendix II Information collected as part of an appropriate observer programme is critically important to the proper management of a fishery Data collected by observers plays a central role in informing fisheries scientists on everything ranging from stock assessments to nontarget species impacts Furthermore observers play an indispensable role in monitoring and enforcing very important CMMs in the WCPO Indeed observers represent the vanguard of fisheries management through the science and service that they provide Consequently observer safety and security as well as appropriate observer coverage must be considered a top priority along with greater support for relevant authorities to see that the capacity of the ROP is strengthened
WCPFC13-2016-OP03,7,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 13th Regular Session Nadi Fiji 59 December 2016 WWF commends the WCPFCs swift and decisive action to lead the world in addressing issues with observer safety and security through the adoption of several key provisions at WCPFC12 WWF supports further efforts to ensure observer safety and security through the full and transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents One of the outstanding gaps in observer safety and security is represented by the lack of information available to address observer incidents through proper followup and documentation that will allow for identification of repeat offenders or potentially dangerous situations for future observers Thus WWF recommends establishing an immediate and transparent reporting procedure for observers to report instances of threats harrassment intimidation or assault that national programmes and the ROP could then use to determine future observer placement This procedure must include an annual publicly available consolidated detailed and fully transparent report of all infractions against observers WWF also welcomes the proposal on flag state responsibilities in the event of alleged observer safety concern offered by the United States which was discussed at length in the TCC12 in both working group and plenary sessions This proposal helps ensure that flag and coastal states fully understand their roles and responsibilities in the event of an observer safety and security concern WWF notes that observer coverage on longline vessels operating in the WCPO regardless of the metrics used to calculate it remains substantially less than 5 regionwide Moreover WWF wishes to emphasise that the 5 observer coverage value identified by the WCPFC represents an arbitrary benchmark that was never intended to represent an end goal but rather a minimum starting point toward appropriate observer coverage Even a consistently applied level of 5 coverage is statistically and practically useless for most management or monitoring control and surveillance MCS purposes Therefore WWF supports efforts to improve the observer coverage of all longline fisheries in the WCPO As such WWF supports calculating observer coverage according to the proposed hierarchy of four metrics for assessing observer coverage but notes that best practice would be to use number of hooks deployed as an appropriate metric If other metrics for calculating coverage are used terms must be very clearly defined in advance and each metric must be calculated in a way to be comparable to the other metrics WWF also notes that different levels of observer coverage may be required for management or compliance purposes depending on specific identified objectives and recommends that appropriate analyses be conducted to determine each of those levels respectively in the context of identified objectives Overall the level of observer coverage on longline vessels must be increased immediately and substantially greater than 5 to achieve any meaningful management and compliance objectives8 Transhipment remains one of the most prominent weaknesses in catch documentation and verification that leads to Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU catch in the WCPO WWF notes that the most simple efficient and effective solution to the challenges of transhipmentrelated IUU is to simply prohibit all atsea transhipment and require all fishing vessels to land their catch at the nearest available designated port in the WCPO following the conclusion of fishing activity However acknowledging that a prohibition on transhipment is politically unlikely at this point WWF supports an unequivocal 100 observer monitoring requirement for all transhipments in all WCPFC CA waters subject to strong sanctions for noncompliance WWF also recommends that transhipment requirements be buttressed by verification and validation of transhipment activities through redundant systems including a vessel monitoring system VMS supplemented by an operating automated identification system AIS If through investigation of suspected unreported transhipment activity indicated by VMS and corroborated by AIS it is determined that transhipment activity was conducted in violation of transhipment rules the offending

WCPFC13-2016-OP03,9,vessels should be subject to sanctions including license revocation and listing on the IUU vessel blacklist WWF recommends the WCPFC Endorse further observer safety and security measures including fully transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents and persons involved Endorse an analysis of levels of observer coverage required to achieve management or compliance purposes while ensuring that the metrics and methodologies used support development of appropriate comparative analyses that meet the needs of the Scientific Services Provider and any MCS objectives Adopt the proposal for flag state requirements for observer safety and security Support or endorse the use of VMS and AIS to verify and validate 100 observer coverage on all transhipments as well as supporting strong penalties and sanctions for violations and Notwithstanding deficiencies in observer coverage WWF views the issue of provision of historic and current operational data as critically important for the proper management of WCPFC stocks Thus WWF encourages the WCPFC to review the legal analysis presented at WCPFC12 on the Provision of Operational Data by Japan and Korea This analysis has since undergone peer review in a prominent legal journal and is available as WCPFC122015OP14 on the Commission website The conclusions of this analysis very clearly indicate that there is no domestic legal constraint for the provision of operational data for either Japan or Korea Therefore Japan and Korea are obligated to provide both historic and current operational data to the WCPFC consistent with several prior agreed CMMs dating back to 2005 WWF recommends the WCPFC Review the conclusions of WCPFC122015OP14 and Request the submission of all current and historic operational data by Japan and Korea Technical reports of all scientific and management bodies responsible for management of the Pacific bluefin tuna stock including the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC and the IATTC indicate that the Pacific Bluefin tuna stock remains in extremely poor condition The ISC confirmed that overfishing continues even though the stock is heavily overfished and its spawning stock biomass has declined to as low as 26 of its unfished level9 This is a clear indicator that the stock is no longer in the status to support industrial fisheries and the management measures taken both in the Western and Central Pacific and in the Eastern Pacific have proven insufficient to conserve the biological integrity of this stock in timely manner The IATTC and WCPFC must take immediate actions and assume their share of responsibility The latest assessment conducted by ISC confirms that the stock is highly depleted that fishing mortality exceeds all reasonable proxies for Fmsy Without the robust and precautionary longterm rebuilding target the recovery of the stock may be further delayed if the current scenario of low recruitment continues which is heavily reliant on a major adult cohort in the population While the WCPFC adopted conservation measures calling for reductions in catch for Pacific bluefin tuna of 30 kg in size the stock requires conservation of all size classes of Pacific bluefin tuna in particular the
WCPFC13-2016-OP03,10,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 13th Regular Session Nadi Fiji 59 December 2016 spawning stocks Thus WWF supports raising the minimum size restriction to 85kg based on the best available scientific information and consideration of the precautionary principle WWF maintains deep concerns regarding this stock with an aim of restoring and rebuilding this ecologically sociologically and economically important fishery resource The current science strongly indicates that there is only one reproductive cohort that is reaching the end of its life Thus the continued reproductive success of the entire stock depends on the reproductive success of a single cohort leaving the stock in a critical situation that may seriously jeopardize recruitment WWF encourages close monitoring of fisheries and catch as well as completion of a revised stock assessment for Pacific bluefin in 2016 WWF urges both IATTC and WCPFC to adopt a longterm Pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan targeting at least 20SSB0 and harvest control rules that are well defined preagreed and contain mandatory actions for a determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points The WCPFC consistent with the best scientific information and consistent with its charge under the Convention to manage this stock must recommend that fishing mortality on Pacific bluefin tuna be urgently and substantially reduced in both juveniles and adults in order to reduce the risk of recruitment collapse and allow spawning stock to rebuild If sufficient management measures cannot be agreed in 2016 the WCPFC must recommend a moratorium on all harvest of Pacific bluefin until such measures are agreed WWF recommends that the WCPFC Agree to a precautionary Limit and Target Reference Point for Pacific bluefin tuna Recommend a longterm Pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan targeting at least SSB0 by 2030 Expand the target size of juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna conservation measures from the current under 30kg requirement to under 85kg Establish a Catch Documentation Scheme CDS for the thorough monitoring of Pacific bluefin tuna and In the absence of agreement on management measures at WCPFC13 recommend a moratorium on all harvest of Pacific bluefin until such time as those measures are agreed WCPFC 2014 Summary Report of the Eleventh Regular Session of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Adopted version 29 July 2015 WCPFC Apia Samoa 15 December 2014 CMM 201406 Conservation and Management Measures to develop and implement a harvest strategy approach for key fisheries and stocks in the WCPO WCPFC 2015 Summary Report of the Twelfth Regular Session of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Adopted version 6 July 2016 WCPFC Bali Indonesia 38 December 2015 Attachment Y p271 Clarke Shelley C et al 2013 Population Trends in Pacific Oceanic Sharks and the Utility of Regulations on Shark Finning Conservation Biology Volume 27 Issue pages 197209 February See Stevenson C et al 2007 High apex predator biomass on remote Pacific islands Coral Reefs 26 4751 See also Friedlander AM and DeMartini EE 2002 Contrasts on density size and biomass of reef fishes between the northwestern and the main Hawaiian islands the effects of fishing down apex predators Marine Ecology Progress Series 230 253264 WCPFC 2014 Summary Report of the Eleventh Regular Session of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Adopted version 29 July 2015 WCPFC Apia Samoa 15 December 2014 Attachment S p262 Clarke Shelley C 2013 Towards an Integrated Shark Conservation and Management Measure for the Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPFCSC92013 EBWP08 WCPFCSC Pohnpei Federated States of Micronesia 614 August 2013 Id at 2427 See eg Elizabeth Babcock et al 2011 How Much Observer Coverage is Enough to Adequately Estimate Bycatch Retrievable at httpwwwawspewtrustsorgmedialegacyuploadedfileswwwpewtrustsorgreportsprotectingoceanlifeoceanabycatch110403pdfpdf Yukio Takeuchi et al 2014 Updated future projections of Pacific bluefin tuna with draft results to answer the requests from NC9ISC14PBFWG110re

WCPFC13-2016-OP06,4,Dear Delegates
WCPFC13-2016-OP06,5,This letter is submitted on behalf of the undersigned nongovernmental organizations and fishing industry organizations that participate in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC process or may seek to do so in the future
WCPFC13-2016-OP06,6,Collectively our organizations work in more than 100 countries and work with industry engage suppliers andor provide advice to retailers buyers and food service sectors regarding improvements in tuna sustainability In addition the undersigned organizations work with or represent many purse seine longline pole and line and handline vessels active in tuna fisheries and recognize that the sustainability of tuna stocks is integral to businesses as well as the health of the marine environment
WCPFC13-2016-OP06,7,We are writing to bring to your attention our views on the development of harvest strategies an issue we believe is fundamental to sustainable fisheries management and one that necessitates immediate action by the WCPFC
WCPFC13-2016-OP06,8,We recognize that the Commission has made some initial progress in recent years to establish basic sciencebased management measures to ensure the sustainability of the worlds largest tuna fishery in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean Specifically in 2015 the Commission committed itself to implement a sixpart harvest strategy approach for each of the key fisheries or stocks under its management including a work plan with clear timelines We support this action and encourage the Commission to apply the Precautionary Approach using clear target and limit reference points and harvest control rules as called for by the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement
WCPFC13-2016-OP06,9,As you prepare for the upcoming 13th Session of the Commission we urge your government to support the full and timely implementation of the Work Plan for harvest strategies including timelines to adopt appropriate biologicallybased target reference points harvest control rules and the other elements of the harvest strategy approach for skipjack bigeye yellowfin and south Pacific albacore tuna In particular we urge you to ensure the Commission takes the decisions necessary this year eg agree on acceptable levels of risk a rebuilding time frame for bigeye and management objectives for south Pacific albacore skipjack bigeye and yellowfin to allow management strategy evaluation and other work to proceed as scheduled in For northern albacore we recognize the ISCs efforts on MSErelated work and encourage continued progress on harvest strategy development consistent with the agreed 20172019 Work Plan including determination of a target reference point together with other elements of harvest strategies
WCPFC13-2016-OP06,10,In addition we request your support for proposals that would establish precautionary target reference points for south Pacific albacore and performance indicators to evaluate harvest control rules for south Pacific albacore and skipjack tuna Finally in order to optimize harvest control rules for all tuna stocks in the future we suggest that the Commission request regular updates from your scientific advisors regarding reference points and performance indicators and development of a monitoring strategy to assess performance against reference points
WCPFC13-2016-OP06,11,We urge the WCPFC to take these actions at its upcoming Commission Meeting in December in Fiji as a matter of priority

WCPFC13-2016-OP07,7,Over the last 20 years civil society has participated in growing numbers in meetings of international environmental organizations including fisheries commissions and their subsidiary bodies1 Known as observers2 nongovernmental organizations NGOs representing business interests environmental interests human rights and other interests are recognized as an integral part of the negotiating process3 Ten thousand individuals representing hundreds of non governmental intergovernmental and governmental bodies regularly attend meetings of the climate change regime4 and the Convention on Biological Diversity5 Smaller numbers of individuals attend meetings of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Professor of Law and Director International Environmental Law Project IELP Lewis Clark Law School SW Terwilliger Blvd Portland OR 97219 woldlclarkedu The author thanks Bubba Cook Erica Lyman and Erik Molenaer for their excellent comments Lewis Clark Law School 2016 Law Clerk IELP See Kal Raustiala States NGOs and International Environmental Institutions 41 INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY 719 722 1997 citing Elin Enge Runar I Malkenes NonGovernmental Organizations at UNCED Another Successful Failure in GREEN GLOBE YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION ON ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT 2535 eds H Bergesen and G Parmann 1993 Raustiala discusses the relative lack of NGO participation in multilateral environmental treaties before the 1970s but much greater and more expansive participation starting around 1985 Raustiala suggests that the increase in NGO participation over time is in part due to the increased complexity of new resource regimes which require more implementation and adjustment Id at See also Barbara Gemmill Abimbola BamideleIzu The Role of NGOs and Civil Society in Global Environmental Governance in GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE 77 78 eds Daniel C Esty Maria H Ivanova 2002 available at httpenvironmentyaleedupublicationseries782html stating that the 1990s witnessed a dramatic increase in the involvement of nongovernmental organizations NGOs in global governance The term observer is the phrase applied to any nonparty participant in an international meeting An observer may represent a State that is not party to the agreement an international organization or a nongovernmental organization representing any number of different interests Raustiala supra note 1 at 721 For example at UNFCCC COPs 1 through 15 over half of the almost 100000 participants were observers including NGOs UN delegates and IGOs Miguel Muoz Cabr Issuelinkages to Climate Change Measured through NGO Participation in the UNFCCC 11 GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS 10 1011 Tbl 1 2011 For the text of the CBD see Convention on Biological Diversity June 5 1992 1760 UNTS 79 31 ILM 818 1992 entered into force Dec 29 1993 available at httpswwwcbdint hereinafter CBD 2 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016

WCPFC13-2016-OP07,9,Greater and more expansive NGO participation in MEAs is consistent with Agenda 218 the so called blueprint for sustainable development Agenda 21 recognizes that NGOs possess well established and diverse experience expertise and capacity in fields which will be of particular importance to the implementation and review of environmentally sound and socially responsible sustainable development9 The CITES Parties have also specifically recognizeed the valuable contributions of observers10 Others report that due to their critical role in service delivery and implementation NGOs have long been recognized as partners of the UN system especially in environmental negotiations11 In the fisheries context the UN Fish Stocks Agreement requires States to provide for transparency in the decisionmaking process and other activities of subregional and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements RFMOs and specifically provides that representatives from intergovernmental organizations and NGOs shall be afforded the opportunity to take part in meetings of RFMOs12 Such procedures shall not be unduly restrictive in this respect Such intergovernmental organizations and nongovernmental organizations shall have timely access to the records and reports of such organizations and arrangements subject to the procedural rules on access to them
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,10,Despite the growing relevance and recognized value of observers in meetings of international organizations some members of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC13 have called for NGO observers to pay extremely high participation fees to attend See CITES Proposed Process to Review the Rules of Procedure of CITES Bodies SC66 Doc 52 2015 available at httpscitesorgcomsc66indexphp showing that more than 900 observers attended the last meeting of the Conference of the Parties For the text of CITES see Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna Mar 3 1973 27 UST 1087 993 UNTS 243 entered into force on July 1 1975 available at httpscitesorg hereinafter CITES CMS Admission of Observers UNEPCMSCOP11Doc8Rev1 2014 available at httpwwwcmsintenmeetingeleventhmeetingconferencepartiescms listing the observers that attended the most recent meeting of the Conference of the Parties in 2014 For the text of CMS see Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals June 23 1979 1651 UNTS 333 entered into force 1983 available at wwwcmsint hereinafter CMS United Nations Conference on Environment and Development Agenda 21 UN Doc ACONF1514 1992 UN Doc ACONF1514 1992 Agenda 21 is a nonbinding implemented action plan concerning sustainable development formed at the UN Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro Brazil in 1992 Id at 273 CITES Resolution Conf 138 RevCoP16 Participation of Observers at Meetings of the Conference of the Parties 2013 available at httpscitesorgengres131308R16php Gemmill BamideleIzu supra note 1 at 81 UN Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of this United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks Aug 4 1995 UNDOC AConf16437 art 122 entered into force Dec 11 2001 hereinafter Fish Stocks Agreement The WCPFC was established by the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean Sept 5 2000 2275 UNTS 43 entered into force June 19 available at httpswwwwcpfcintconventiontext entered into force June 19 2004 hereinafter WCPF Convention 3 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,11,WCPFC meetings14 and observers have been excluded from portions of WCPFC meetings In part due to these issues the WCPFC directed the Secretariat to undertake a review of observer participation at the Commission covering the following possible elements 1 the number of observers which have attended meetings 2 whether it is appropriate to limit numbers on observers delegations 3 whether it is appropriate for observers to pay an annual contribution towards the meeting costs 4 how to accommodate treating separately observers which support the effective participation in the Commission by Small Island Developing States 5 whether andor how to accommodate treating separately observers that are direct stakeholders such as harvest groups 6 transparency and 7 access to documents15 In addition the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and TunaLike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC16 which provides scientific and management advice to the WCPFC recently adopted restrictive rules for observer participation
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,12,To complement the Secretariats review and to determine whether the proposal for high fees for observer participation in the WCPFC the exclusion of observers from WCPFCrelated meetings and the ISCs restrictive observer participation rules are consistent with trends in international law this report reviews the rules for observer participation in 14 international organizations five MEAs six regional fisheries management organizations RMFOs and three International Science Organizations ISOs The five MEAs are

WCPFC13-2016-OP07,21,II The Value of Observer Participation
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,22,NGO observers provide many important benefits to States participating in international agreements even if States sometimes view NGOs as oppositional to State power or as diminishing State power27 As one scholar writes NGO participation does not come at the expense of state centrality rather it is to the advantage of states28 NGOs provide advantages to States because they do not necessarily only lobby State Parties to vote a particular way on an issue they perform a variety of valuable functions critical to the international policymaking process29 For example NGO observers help 1 address scientific economic and other uncertainties by researching and presenting relevant information to policy makers 2 organize workshops seminars and conferences to enhance knowledge intersessionally 3 share their expertise by participating on State delegations 4 participate in review and enforcement procedures 5 ensure transparency of the decisionmaking process 6 provide support to convention secretariats 7 and provide ontheground support on relevant issues outside the negotiations30 Regarding ontheground support Greenpeace in 2015 detected a vessel fishing within the WCPFC Convention Area that was not registered to fish in the area31
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,23,International policymaking and in particular international environmental policymaking is typically complex and often entails scientific economic and other uncertainties32 NGOs are in an ideal position to help address that uncertainty33 because they hire professionals to research the scientific economic social and technical aspects of specific issues their research may then be made available to States34 NGOs may also disseminate information at intersessional workshops seminars or conferences35 That research allows States to minimize their own research expenses while maximizing the amount of policy information they obtain36 This research may be particularly valuable to developing countries that lack the resources to conduct their own See Raustiala supra note 1 at 72526 Id at 720 Ecologic Participation of NonGovernmental Organisations in International Environmental Governance 40 2002 available at httpecologiceu605 See id at 4051 See also Gemmill BamideleIzu supra note 1 at 83 creating a similar list but adding representation of the voiceless as an additional role Forum Fisheries Agency Proposal for Management of Enclosed and SemiEnclosed High Seas Areas WCPFC122015DP05 Oct 21 2015 available at httpswwwwcpfcintsystemfilesWCPFC122015 DP0520FFA20proposal20for20management20of20enclosed20and20semi enclosed20high20seas20areas0pdf Id at 41 See Raustiala supra note 1 at 727 Raustiala further suggests that although NGOs have inherent bias in the information presented those biases are generally known to the governments involved and the governments can evaluate and use the data if appropriate Id See also Ecologic supra note 29 at 4042 Ecologic offers several examples of organizations including World Resources Institute World Watch Institute World Conservation Monitoring Centre and International Institute for Sustainable Development that are particularly active in providing information to Parties to assist in decisionmaking Id at 4142 Tobias Bhmelt Carola Betzold The Impact of Environmental Interest Groups in International Negotiations Do ENGOs Induce Stronger Environmental Commitments 13 INTL ENVTL AGREEMENTS POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS 127 132 2013 See Ecologic supra note 29 at 41 Raustiala supra note 1 at 727 6 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,24,research37 For example at the Basel Convention NGOs provided documentation on the ineffectiveness of the original prior informed consent procedure concerning the transboundary movement of hazardous waste38 Within CITES NGOs document illegal trade and killing of elephants to help Parties determine whether to allow international trade in elephant ivory39
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,25,National delegations also commonly tap NGO expertise by inviting NGO representatives to serve on their delegations They are often tasked with representing the interests of civil society even if they have limited ability while on a governmental delegation to lobby on behalf of their NGOs interests40 Alternatively NGO representatives may serve as advisers for specific issues Again those representatives have increased access but their ability to directly lobby for their NGOs position is limited For example member States of the Alliance of Small Island States AOSIS have asked a representative of the International Environmental Law Project to be on delegation to provide legal advice at climate change negotiations41 The United Kingdom has invited NGO representatives to participate on the delegations to annual meetings of the International Whaling Commission42
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,26,NGOs can also assist in review and enforcement procedures Although NGOs typically do not have a direct role in enforcement proceedings and their participation varies by agreement several agreements including the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats43 allow NGOs to initiate a compliance matter44 or participate as a member of the Id at 73132 See Ecologic supra note 29 at 41 Other examples include the Environmental Investigation Agency proving Parties to the Montreal Protocol information on the illegal trade of ozonedepleting substances or Greenpeace International providing information on the illegal trade of hazardous wastes Id at 4142 Not only environmental organizations provide information An industry association the Alternative Fluorocarbon Environmental Acceptability Study provides Parties to the Montreal Protocol with information on production of ozonedepleting substances Id at 42 CITES Resolution Conf 1010 Rev CoP16 Trade in Elephant Specimens available at httpscitesorgengres101010R16php stating that data and information on illegal trade in elephant ivory and other elephant specimens will be collected by TRAFFIC an NGO in collaboration with the CITES Secretariat See Ecologic supra note 29 at 4445 Personal Observation See IWC Delegates and Observers Attending the 63rd Annual Meeting IWC633 Draft 6 available at httpsiwcintprivatedownloadsaWwobcJ3SrKVUCBsZuab8g633V6pdf showing Vassili Papastavrou who worked for the International Fund for Animal Welfare at the time and Jennifer Lonsdale who works for the Environmental Investigation Agency as members of the United Kingdoms delegation Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats signed Sept 19 1979 entered into force Jan 6 1982 CETS No 104 available at httpconventionscoeintTreatyenTreatiesHtml104htm To help ensure that the Parties to the Bern Convention actually implement the Conventions obligations the Parties developed a casefile system which specifically allows NGOs to initiate complaints of violation of the convention Council of Europe Monitoring Set Up under the Bern Convention available at httpwwwcoeintenwebbern conventionmonitoring Bern Convention Monitoring Set Up under the Bern Convention available at httpwwwcoeintenwebbern conventionmonitoring stating that the casefile system dating back to 1984 is a unique monitoring tool based on complaints for possible breaches of the Convention that can be submitted by NGOs or even private citizens emphasis in original See also Agreement on the Conservation of AfricanEurasian Migratory Waterbirds AEWA Resolution 46 Establishment of an Implementation Review Process available at httpwwwunep aewaorgenactivitiesirp Although the resolution itself provides that the process is initiated when the Secretariat receives information the roster of claims clarifies that NGOs are allowed and have initiated compliance matters 7 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,27,compliance committee45 NGOs can be uniquely positioned to independently monitor and assess a States compliance with its treaty obligations46 For example NGOs have provided reports assessing State compliance with pledges made pursuant to various international agreements or have tracked wildlife trade in order to evaluate a regimes progress47 Scholars have identified monitoring by NGOs as a key factor in the effectiveness of an international agreement48
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,28,Transparency is fundamental to the democratic process and can help hold policy makers accountable for their decisions49 NGOs can directly assist during a negotiation by reporting on the daily events at a meeting This reporting not only allows transparency of the negotiations but can also help State delegates keep informed with daily developments50 Governments are not positioned to provide such reporting because their focus is on negotiating51 In a multiforum negotiation such as the climate change negotiations and CITES negotiations such reporting can provide governments with critical information In addition to providing such information at meetings NGOs also convey a simple and easily understood message regarding complex negotiations to the public52
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,29,NGOs also may provide important support for international secretariats In some cases that may be by serving as the secretariat such as when the International Union for Conservation of Nature served as the secretariat during early days of the Ramsar Convention53 Additionally NGOs can provide information such as background papers and other informational documents to a secretariat54 See AEWA Implementation Review Process IRP Onthespot Assessment Mission Sociable Lapwing Conservation in Syria Final Report 2010 available at httpwwwunep aewaorgsitesdefaultfilesbasicpagedocumentsfinalaewasyriairpreportpdf stating that the process began in August 2009 when the AEWA Secretariat received a completed Possible Case Information Sheet from BirdLife International an NGO The Basel Convention for example includes nonState actors on its compliance committee See Basel Convention Mechanism for Promoting Implementation and Compliance with the Obligations Under the Basel Convention para 3 As adopted by the sixth meeting of the Conference of the Parties decision VI12 and amended by the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties decision BC1011 stating that the compliance committee consists of 15 members nominated by the Parties as opposed to 15 Parties The implementation committee of the Agreement on International Dolphin Conservation and Protection also includes nonState actors including representatives from the Humane Society International and the fishing industry Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program May 1 1998 Annex 2 para 3 available at httpwwwiattcorgIDCPDocumentsENGhtm stating that the review panel shall include three representatives of nongovernmental environmental organizations with recognized experience in matters pertaining to this Agreement and with offices in the territory of a Party and three representatives from the tuna industry that operates under the jurisdiction of any of the Parties in the Agreement Area nongovernmental members Gemmill BamideleIzu supra note 1 at 9394 Raustiala supra note 1 at 72829 Ecologic supra note 29 at 47 Raustiala supra note 1 at 729 See Ecologic supra note 29 at 4648 See id See Raustiala supra note 1 at 730 A delegate at the 1972 Stockholm Environment Conference noted that the crew that put out ECO should attend all international conferences so well know what the hell is going on Id Id See Ecologic supra note 29 at 4647 Id at 48 Id 8 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,30,Finally NGOs may play an important role after negotiations are over55 Without domestic support an international treaty may collapse after negotiations are complete NGOs are often important domestic players involving them in international negotiations may help negotiators gauge domestic support during the negotiation and may also help after negotiations when States are trying to implement domestic policies56 For example NGO support for the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperationa side agreement to North American Free Trade Agreementhelped spur adoption of the free trade agreement57
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,31,NGOs provide meaningful support throughout the life of an MEA during its negotiation prior to meetings during meetings and after meetings This participation enhances the ability in both technocratic and political terms of states to regulate through the treaty process58
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,32,III A Summary of Practices in MEAs RFMOs and ISOs
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,33,This section summarizes the rules for observer participation across a range of MEAs RFMOs and ISOs As an overview it does not include all the details found in the various documents reviewed More detail can be found in the Annex
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,34,A Criteria for Admission of Observers
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,35,Each of the MEAs RFMOs and ISOs reviewed allows NGOs and other organizations to attend and participate as observers without voting rights in meetings of the relevant decisionmaking body59 To attend and participate NGOs must request permission from the relevant administrative body usually the secretariat and meet specified technical requirements60
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,36,The criteria for admission of observers are typically written broadly although limited by a requirement to be technically qualified in the area covered by the convention The CBD Montreal Protocol CITES CMS and others require NGOs to be qualified in fields relating to that MEA RFMO or ISO such as biodiversity conservation in the context of the CBD61 The IOTC requires organizations to have special competence in the field of activity of the See Raustiala supra note 1 at 731 Id Specifically Raustiala points to the failure of the Convention on the Regulatory of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities to be implemented domestically due to opposition from NGOs Id Id Id at 736 See eg CITES supra note 6 at arts XI67 Montreal Protocol supra note 17 at art 115 CCSBT supra note 18 at art 142 See eg CITES supra note 6 at art XI7 UNFCCC supra note 18 at art 76 See eg CBD supra note 5 at art 235 qualified in fields relating to conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity UNFCCC supra note 18 at art 76 qualified in matters covered by the Convention CITES supra note 6 at art XI7 technically qualified in protection conservation or management of wild fauna and flora Antigua Convention supra note 21 at art XV1 recognized experience in matters pertaining to the Commission and the tuna industry 9 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,37,Commission62 The WCPFC requires NGOs to be concerned with matters relevant to implementation of the WCPF Convention63
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,38,Regardless of the language used NGOs representing diverse interests including animal welfare organizations trade associations user groups and others have participated in meetings of these bodies With only one exception this broad inclusion and broad interpretation of the criteria for admission of observers spans MEAs RFMOs and ISOs Of the international organizations reviewed in this report only the CCSBT appears to limit observer participation based on qualifications in any significant way64
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,39,B Application Requirements and Deadlines for Obtaining Observer Status
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,40,Each of the MEAs RFMOs and ISOs reviewed in this paper has a specific process for an organization to apply for observer status Each requires an organization to submit specific information to the conventions administrative body for consideration such as a description of the organizations activities that demonstrate it is qualified in the field relating to the relevant MEA RFMO or ISO Each also requires an application to be submitted prior to the meeting these deadlines typically range from just prior to the meeting65 to 100 days One the CCSBT does not give a specific deadline but the application must be submitted in time to allow the Secretary to advise Members of the request 50 days before the meeting66 The UNFCCC is an outlier requiring NGOs to submit documentation more than one year prior to a meeting67 however once that documentation is submitted the accepted organization does not need to resubmit its documentation for subsequent meetings68 ICCAT IATTC IOTC and CCSBT also assess an application only once without requiring observers to reapply for admission69
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,41,Eleven of the MEAs RFMOs and ISOs reviewed allow Members to object to an organizations participation Most commonly CMS CITES IATTC ICCAT CBD Montreal Protocol and UNFCCC observers may participate unless onethird of the Parties or Members object to an organizations participation70 The IATTC and ICCAT consider applications as accepted unless IOTC Agreement supra note 20 at art VII WCPF Convention supra note 13 at art 21 CCSBT Attendance at Meetings by Observers available at httpwwwccsbtorgsiteobserversattendancephp CMS Rules of Procedure for Meetings of the Conference of the Parties UNEPCMSCOP11REPORT Annex II at Rule 23 CCSBT Rules of Procedure of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna Rules 35 available at httpswwwccsbtorgsitesccsbtorgfilesuserfilesfiledocsenglishbasicdocumentsrulesofprocedureofthec ommissionpdf UNFCCC Information Note Revised Deadlines for Applications from Organizations for Admission as Observers to the UNFCCC Process July 8 2013 available at httpsunfcccintfilespartiesandobserversnotificationsapplicationpdfinformationnoteonreviseddeadlinesf oradmissionpdf Personal Observation Email from Erik Molenaar Deputy Director Netherlands Institute for the Law of the Sea NILOS Utrecht University to Chris Wold July 29 2016 CITES supra note 6 at art XI7 CBD supra note 5 at art 235 CMS supra note 7 at art VII9 Montreal Protocol supra note 17 at art 115 UNFCCC supra note 18 at art 76 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,42,onethird of Contracting Parties object in writing at least 30 days before the meeting71 with the IATTC requiring objections to be for cause72 The WCPFC requires a majority of Members to object in writing73 Others however are more restrictive the CCSBT requires all Members to approve the NGOs participation74 while NAFO and the IOTC require a vote on the matter if one Member objects75
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,43,C Fees for Participation
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,44,Many MEAs RFMOs and ISOs have rules allowing the relevant administrative body to impose a standard participation fee on observer organizations but in practice few actually impose fees on observers In fact a recent CITES document76 shows that nine MEAs do not charge fees These include five MEAs reviewed in this paper CBD CMS the Montreal Protocol and the associated Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and UNFCCC The other MEAs that do not charge fees are the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat Ramsar Convention77 Only the International Whaling Commission and the International Tropical Timber Organization charge fees78 The CITES document is consistent with the findings of this report Of the MEAs reviewed only CITES charges a fee for each meeting of the Conference of the Parties the first observer for an organization must pay 600 with each additional observer paying 30079 Among the RFMOs ICCAT requires observers to pay a fee for each meeting 500 for up to two observers and an additional 350 US fee has to be paid for each additional person in the observer delegation80 It Antigua Convention supra note 22 at Annex 2 7 ICCAT Guidelines and Criteria for Granting Observer Status at ICCAT Meetings Misc 0512 4 2005 available at httpiccatintDocumentsRecscompendiopdf e200512epdf hereinafter ICCAT Guidelines Antigua Convention supra note 22 at Annex 7 WCPFC Commission01 Rules of Procedure Annex I Rule 364 2004 available at httpswwwwcpfcintdoccommission01rulesprocedure hereinafter WCPFC Rules of Procedure CCSBT Rules of Procedure supra note 66 at Rule 39 NAFO Rules of Procedure for Observers to NAFO Meetings General Council Fisheries Commission and Scientific Council at Rules 45 in Rules of Procedure Finance Regulations 2014 available at httpwwwnafointpublicationsframespublicationshtml IOTC Rules of Procedure Rule XIV5 2014 available at httpiotcorgdocumentsindianoceantunacommissionrulesprocedure2014 hereinafter IOTC Rules of Procedure CITES Financial Reports for 2014 and 2015 SC66 Doc 101 at 78 Tbl 3 2015 available at httpscitesorgcomsc66indexphp Id The IWC charges NGOs a fee of 580 British Pounds for the first observer and 285 British Pounds for each additional observer The ITTO has fees that range from zero to 300 Id CITES Resolution Conf 162 CoP16 Financing and the Costed Programme of Work for the Secretariat for the Triennium 20142016 2013 available at httpswwwcitesorgengres161602php CITES Notification No 020 1 Mar 16 2016 setting fees for CoP17 in September 2016 available at httpscitesorgsitesdefaultfilesnotifENotif2016020pdf Email from Driss Meski ICCAT Executive Secretary to Chris Wold May 20 2016 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,45,previously charged 2000 but reduced the fee to allow access to all relevant NGOs and thus enhancee transparency and inclusiveness81 The IATTC charges 500 for the first observer and 350 for each additional observer82 The IOTC allows the administrative body or the Commission itself to implement a fee for observer participation83 but it has never charged a fee84 Neither does the CCSBT85 PICES charged participants in its 2015 annual meeting between 50 and 275 Canadian depending on the persons status for example student invited speaker or nonspeaking participant86
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,46,The fees charged are intended to cover the additional costs arising from the observers participation For example the IOTC Rules of Procedure state that the Commission may decide to request a contribution towards the additional administrative costs arising from the attendance of observers at its Sessions87 The IATTC rules for registration include similar language88 CITES similarly provides that fees relate to the effective costs of participation of observers89

WCPFC13-2016-OP07,48,Each MEA RFMO and ISO allows observers to attend the plenary session of the convention90 Nine of them however have possible restrictions on that ability For example the CBD UNFCCC CCSBT CITES CMS CBD and IOTC allow the Members to close a session to observers through a vote91 Sometimes a simple majority is needed to close a session as in CITES meetings92 at other times a twothirds majority is needed to close a session as at CMS meetings93 These bodies sometimes do in fact close meetings claiming a need to ensure confidentiality avoid politicizing issues for example regarding compliance issues or conduct Id IATTC Registration for AIDCP and IATTC Meetings available at httpwwwiattcorgmeetingregistration0620 IOTC Rules of Procedure supra note 75 at Rule XIV6 Email from Dave Wilson Deputy Secretary Science Manager Indian Ocean Tuna Commission to Chris Wold May 20 2016 Email from Robert Kennedy Executive Secretary Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna to Chris Wold May 22 2016 PICES PICES 2015 Annual Meeting Registration Registration Fees available at httppicesintmeetingsannualPICES20152015registrationaspx IOTC Rules of Procedure supra note at Rule XIV6 IATTC Registration for AIDCP and IATTC Meetings supra note 82 at 6 stating that observers will be required to pay a fee for their participation at the meetings of the Organization which will contribute to the additional expenses generated by their participation CITES Resolution Conf 162 supra note 79 See eg See eg CBD Rules of Procedure for Meetings of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity see Annex to Decision I1 and Decision V20 at Rule 291 available at httpswwwcbdintdoclegalcbdrulesprocedurepdf hereinafter CBD Rules of Procedure IOTC Rules of Procedure supra note 75 at Rules IV1 XIV8 CITES Rules of Procedure for the Conference of the Parties as amended at the 16th meeting Bangkok 2013 at Rule 121 available at httpscitesorgsitesdefaultfilesengcopE16Rulespdf hereinafter CITES Rules of Procedure of Meetings of the Conference of the Parties UNFCCC Draft Rules of Procedure FCCCCP19962 at Rule 391 May 22 1996 available at httpunfcccintresourcedocscop202pdf hereinafter UNFCCC Rules of Procedure CITES Rules of Procedure of Meetings of the Conference of the Parties supra note 91 at Rule 121 CMS Rules of Procedure supra note 65 at Rules 22 23 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,49,sensitive discussions and hard bargaining for example regarding the budget94 The treaty and the applicable Rules of Procedure do not always identify when meetings can be closed although ICCAT rules limit closed meetings to extraordinary meetings held in executive sessions or meetings of Heads of Delegations95 Meetings of the WCPFC and its subsidiary bodies should be closed only in exceptional circumstances96 One comprehensive review of NGO participation in MEAs concluded that meetings should be closed to NGOs on a casebycase basis and that only very limited exceptions to the general rule of access to meetings on the basis of welldefined criteria eg consideration of confidential information might be justifiable97 ICES and PICES observers can attend with agreement of the Council
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,50,Whether or not observers can attend meetings other than plenary sessions is often less clear Several agreements do not specifically enable an observer to attend each meeting but more vaguely note that all proceedings are open to observers CITES and CMS allow observers to participate in committees98 but require the chair to invite observers to working group meetings99 While most working groups are open to observers sometimes the chair will limit the number of observers that may participate or omit observer participation completely if the issue is considered politically sensitive100 ICCAT allows observers to participate in working groups although the chair may limit their participation101 At the other end of the spectrum the UNFCCC rarely if ever allows observers to participate in working group meetings102 In fact the UNFCCC created a new kind of meetinginformalinformalsto exclude from meetings observers who would otherwise have the right to participate in the meeting103 IOTC meetings are open to observers unless the IOTC decides otherwise104 Further ICES has specific procedures for evaluating if observers can attend different sessions some of which require advanced notice of an observers desire to attend the specified meeting CBD allows observers to attend specific meetings
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,51,An observers ability to participate in other ways is not always specified Some MEAs RFMOs and ISOs make clear that observers may make oral statements and if permission is granted display posters and exhibits in specified areas Each treaty allows observers to address the plenary meeting Treaties sometimes specify limits on observer participation for example by allowing the Chair to call a speaker to order determine the order of speaking and limit the amount of time or number of times an observer can speak Finally IATTC ICCAT and ICES also vaguely note that observers may participate in other ways as appropriate without specifying Ecologic supra note 29 at 6 67 158 ICCAT Guidelines and Criteria for Granting Observer Status at ICCAT Meetings supra note 71 at 2 The IATTC similarly restricts closed sessions to meetings held in executive sessions or meetings of Heads of Delegations Antigua Convention supra note 22 at Annex 2 2 WCPFC Rules of Procedure supra note 73 at Rule 15 Id at 12 CITES Rules of Procedure of Meetings of the Conference of the Parties supra note 91 at Rule 121 CMS Rules of Procedure supra note 65 at Rule 122 CITES Rules of Procedure of Meetings of the Conference of the Parties supra note 91 at Rule 122 CMS Rules of Procedure supra note 65 at Rule 122 Personal Observation Email from Driss Meski supra note 80 Personal Observation Personal Observation IOTC Rules of Procedure supra note 75 at Rules VI1 XIV8 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,52,what those ways would be or when it is appropriate The WCPFC allows observers to participate and intervene at its meetings even though the Rules of Procedure state that NGO observers are only entitled to sit at meetings105
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,53,E Receipt of Meeting Documents by Observers
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,54,The rules of the MEAs RFMOs and ISOs reviewed do not always articulate whether observers may obtain relevant documents including 1 proposals draft resolutions and budget documents submitted prior to the meeting 2 insession revisions to proposals draft resolutions budget documents 3 summary records of the meeting and 4 informational documents However most if not all of the MEAs RFMOs and ISOs reviewed in this report make all documents available to observers at the same time they are made available to the parties or members106 The IATTC IOTC and NAFO have specific deadlines for making specific documents available to observers and members simultaneously107 That said RFMOs and fisheries scientific bodies sometimes protect confidential information from being disclosed to observers108 Also the IATTC and WCPFC sometimes restrict documents under active negotiation to members only109 The practice within a specific MEA RFMO or ISO often provides the culture of document distribution with the official website frequently being the most common way for a document to be distributed
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,55,F Distribution of Documents by Observers
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,56,The distribution of documents by observers is generally permissible although the types of documents that observers may distribute may be restricted or require approval through the relevant administrative body or the chair CITES for example expressly allows documents to be submitted without review by the Secretariat provided that the observers organization offering the documents is clearly identified110 IOTC limits the distribution of documents by observers to those documents invited by the IOTC111 NAFO limits the distribution of documents to only See WCPFC Rules of Procedure supra note 73 at Rule 365 Personal Observation regarding CMS UNFCCC CITES and WCPFC Email from Gilbert M Bankobeza Chief Legal Affairs and Compliance Ozone Secretariat to Chris Wold May 25 2016 regarding Montreal Protocol Email from Simone Lovera Executive Director Global Forest Coalition to Chris Wold June 24 2016 regarding IPBES See eg IATTC IATTC Rules of Procedure at Rule 14 2014 available at httpwwwiattcorgPDFFilesIATTCRulesofprocedureamendedOct2014pdf IOTC Rules of Procedure supra note 75 at Rule IV1 NAFO Rules of Procedure for the General Council Rule 2 in Rules of Procedure Finance Regulations 2014 available at httpwwwnafointpublicationsframespublicationshtml See eg IATTC Rules of Procedure supra note 109 at Rule 14 ICCAT Guidelines and Criteria for Granting Observer Status at ICCAT Meetings supra note 71 at 8 NAFO Rules of Procedure for Observers to NAFO Meetings supra note 75 at Rule 6a See Email from Rebecca Regnery Deputy Director of Wildlife Humane Society International to Chris Wold Sept 22 2015 noting that the IATTC has a password protected section of its website for some meeting documents Email from Alfred Cook Western Central Pacific Tuna Programme Manager World Wildlife Fund Smart Fishing Initiative to Chris Wold Oct 29 2015 1430 CITES Rules of Procedure of the Conference of the Parties supra note 91 at Rules 283 IOTC Rules of Procedure supra note 75 at Rule XIV8 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016

WCPFC13-2016-OP07,58,IV Conclusion
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,59,The rules for observer participation in the MEAs RFMOs and ISOs are generally consistent with the view that NGOs are an integral part of negotiations and partners in the process of negotiating text monitoring implementation and assessing compliance While the rules vary among the MEAs RFMOs and ISOs reviewed most allow expansive participation including the ability to attend most meetings speak in most meetings receive most if not all documents and distribute documents They also charge no fees for observer participation or an amount designed to pay for the added cost of their participation in a meeting
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,60,Against that background the suggestion of some WCPFC members that observers should pay a large fee to participate in WCPFC meetings is inconsistent with current practice While some MEAs RFMOs and ISOs charge a fee most do not and certainly no MEA RFMO or ISO charges anything close to 10000 In fact ICCAT rescinded its 2000 fee as inequitable and inconsistent with transparency
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,61,In addition the ISCs rules for observer participation are inconsistent with the rules reviewed for this paper they are far more restrictive than even the most restrictive rules for observer participation
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,62,ISC Protocol Rules ISC Observer Protocol June 2013 Summary Analysis Observers must apply at least 60 days in advance of the ISC meeting and a single member may veto an observer application without explanation Consistent While applications deadlines vary 60 days is within the timeframe of many of the MEAs RFMOs and ISOs reviewed in this report Inconsistent The authority of a single member to veto the participation of an observer is inconsistent of the MEAs RFMOs and ISOs reviewed here only the CCSBT has a similar rule NAFO Rules of Procedure for Observers to NAFO Meetings supra note 75 at Rule 6d WCPF Commission Rules of Procedure supra note 73 at Rules 36 Bankobeza supra note 106 CBD Guidelines for the Participation of Representatives of Observer Organizations at Meetings of the Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Subsidiary Bodies 14 17 Sept 16 available at httpswwwcbdintdocmeetingscopcop10othercop10guidelinesobserverenpdf UNFCCC Guidelines for the Participation of Representatives of NonGovernmental Organizations at D1 March 2003 available at httpsunfcccintfilespartiesandobserversngoapplicationpdfcocguidepdf Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,63,Observer participation is restricted to the Plenary session only Inconsistent Observers are generally allowed to participate in committees working groups and other subsidiary bodies Observers cannot submit documents to the Plenary or associated workshops Inconsistent Observers are typically able to distribute documents Observer documents will not be posted on the ISC meeting website Not clear Some MEAs RFMOs and ISOs post observer documents to the relevant website and others do not Observers are allotted a single limited period at the end of each day when they may ask technical questions about ISC assessments and procedures only presentations or expressions of positions by observers are not permitted Inconsistent Observers are typically allowed the right to speak on any matter provided they speak when called on by the Chair

WCPFC13-2016-OP07,69,The Convention on Biological Diversity CBD allows both governmental and non governmental that are qualified in fields relating to conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity to be admitted as an observer to a meeting of the Conference of the Parties after the organization informs the Secretariat of its desire to be represented and unless one third of Parties present objects116 Similarly the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafetyadopted by the CBD Partiesallows governmental or nongovernmental bodies qualified in matters covered by this Protocol to participate as observers at meetings of the Protocols Parties after informing the Secretariat of the desire to attend and unless at least onethird of the Parties present object117 Both the CBD and the Cartagena Protocol allow the United Nations its specialized agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency and any State not a party to be observers at meetings of the Conference of the Parties118
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,70,The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES allows any body or agency technically qualified in protection conservation or management of wild fauna and flora to attend meetings of the parties as observers119 To attend observers must follow certain procedures For example all observerswhether governmental or nongovernmentalmust inform the Secretariat of their desire to attend and in the case of national NGOs must obtain approval from the State in which they are located 120 The Parties also adopted a resolution that requires an NGO to be an organization in its own right with a legal persona and an international character remit and programme of activities121 If they follow these procedures observers have the right to attend the meeting unless onethird of the Parties present object122 However the Secretariat generally does not deny organizations observer CBD supra note 5 at art 235 Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity Jan 29 2000 2226 UNTS 208 entered into force Sept 11 2003 art 298 available at httpbchcbdintdatabaseattachmentid10694 CBD supra note 5 at art 235 Cartagena Protocol supra note 109 at art 298 Contracting Parties that have not ratified accepted or approved a protocol can also participate as an observer in a meeting of the Parties to that protocol CBD supra note 5 at art 322 The admission and participation of observers are subject to the Rules of Procedures Id at art 321 Similarly Parties to the Convention that are not Parties to the Protocol may participate as observers in the meetings of the Protocol as observers Cartagena Protocol supra note 109 at art 29 2 CITES supra note 6 at art XI7 Id CITES Resolution Conf 138 RevCoP16 supra note 10 CITES supra note 6 at art XI7 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016

WCPFC13-2016-OP07,72,Each of the CITES subsidiary bodiesthe Standing Committee Animals Committee and Plants Committeehas its own rules of procedure that allow governmental bodies and NGOs to participate in its meetings126 Technically the chair of the relevant committee invites the observers to participate127 but in practice the process is run by the secretariat Representatives of Parties who are not represented on the committees may also attend meetings as observers with the right to participate but not to vote128
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,73,Under these rules a wide variety of organizations have participated in CITES meetings These include representatives from organizations supporting on the one hand the pet industry zoos captive breeding operations the coral industry various fisheries associations and others supporting international trade in species They also include a variety of groups more resistant to international trade have been admitted as observers including those opposing sport hunting and other lethal uses of wildlife129
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,74,The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals CMS allows national and international agencies or bodieswhether governmental or nongovernmentalto participate in meetings of the parties provided that they are technically qualified in protection conservation and management of migratory species130 The text of the convention requires national NGOs to obtain approval of the State in which they are located131 although in practice that is not required132 If they follow these procedures observers have the right to participate in the meeting unless onethird of the Parties present object133 although no legitimate organization Personal Observation However on rare occasions NGOs are not approved by the appropriate national body ie US FWS in the United States Id Personal Observation On the very rare occasion Parties have revoked observer status it has been for cause where an organization for example bloodied the tusk of an elephant in the CITES meeting banner Id CITES supra note 6 at art XI6 See also CITES Rules of Procedure of the Conference of the Parties supra note 91 at Rule 21 CITES Rules of Procedure of the Standing Committee Rules 4 5 6 2012 available at httpscitesorgsitesdefaultfilesengcomscrulespdf CITES Rules of Procedure of Meetings of the Animals Committee Rules 5 6 7 2014 available at httpscitesorgsitesdefaultfilesengcomac28EAC2820Rev1pdf CITES Rules of Procedure of Meetings of the Plants Committee Rules 5 6 7 2014 available at httpscitesorgsitesdefaultfilesengcompcEPC21RoP2014pdf CITES Rules of Procedure of the Standing Committee supra note 126 at Rule 61 CITES Rules of Procedure of Meetings of the Animals Committee supra note 126 at Rule 7 CITES Rules of Procedure of Meetings of the Plants Committee supra note 126 at Rule 7 CITES Rules of Procedure of Meetings of the Plants Committee supra note 126 at Rule 4 CITES CITES Rules of Procedure of Meetings of the Animals Committee supra note 126 at Rule 4 CITES List of Participants Observers Fifteenth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties 2010 available at httpscitesorgsitesdefaultfilescommoncop15cop15participantsobserverspdf CMS supra note 7 at art VII9 CMS Rules of Procedure supra note 65 at Rule 22 Id Personal Observation CMS supra note 7 at art VII9 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016

WCPFC13-2016-OP07,76,In addition observers may attend meetings of the CMS Standing Committee and Scientific Council With respect to participation at a Standing Committee meeting an observer that has attended the meeting of the Conference of the Parties COP immediately preceding the Standing Committee meeting may attend at its own expense after providing notice to the Secretariat137 If a body or agency did not attend the previous meeting of the COP it may participate in a Standing Committee meeting if it submits a request to the secretariat at least 30 days before the meeting with information describing its technical qualifications the names of individuals who are authorized to attend the meeting and confirmation that the observer will meet its own expenses138 The chair of the Scientific Council also has discretion to invite organizations to participate in meetings of the Council139 As with CITES a wide range of groups have attended CMS meetings including those favoring wildlife protection and those favoring the use of wildlife for human benefit140
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,77,The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer Montreal Protocol specifies that organizations qualified in fields relating to the protection of the ozone layer may request and be admitted as observers unless onethird of the Parties present object141 The Montreal Protocol further requires the Secretariat to encourage nonParties to attend meetings of the Parties as observers142 Observers once invited by the President may participate without the right to vote in any meeting in matters of direct concern to the body or agency they See Email from Melanie Virtue Head Aquatic Species Team Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals to author Sept 9 2015 on file with author Similarly the Secretariat has denied observer status for individuals who apply but do not represent an organization Personal observation CMS Admission of Observers CoP11Doc8Rev1 2014 available at httpwwwcmsintsitesdefaultfilesdocumentCOP11Doc08AdmissionofObserverstoCOPERev201 0pdf CMS supra note 7 at art VII8 CMS 44th Meeting of the Standing Committee Rules of Procedure Rule 21 2015 available at httpwwwcmsintsitesdefaultfilesdocumentDoc3Rulesofprocedurepdf Id at Rule 22 CMS Rules of Procedure of the CMS Scientific Council UNEPCMS ScC17Inf2 at Rule 7 2011 available at httpwwwcmsintsitesdefaultfilesdocumentinf02rulesofproceduree0pdf To that effect the Parties recognized and invited specific organizations to participate in the Scientific Council CMS Institutional Arrangements Scientific Council Res 67 1999 available at httpwwwcmsintsitesdefaultfilesdocumentRes607E00pdf See CMS Provisional List of Participants CoP11 Inf 14 2014 showing registration of representatives of Federation of Associations for Hunting and Conservation of the EU and the International Fund for Animal Welfare Montreal Protocol supra note 17 at art 115 United Nations Environment Programme Ozone Secretariat Rules of Procedure for Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol at Rule 71 available at httpozoneuneporgenhandbookmontrealprotocolsubstancesdepleteozonelayer2158 Montreal Protocol supra note 17 at art 12 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016

WCPFC13-2016-OP07,79,The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC in language similar to the CBDs permits governmental and nongovernmental bodies that are qualified in matters covered by the Convention and that have informed the Secretariat of the desire to attend a meeting as an observer to be admitted unless onethird of the Parties present object146 The United Nations its specialized agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency and State members that are not Parties can also be admitted as observers147 The conventions Subsidiary Body for Implementation expressly encourages the participation of NGOs from developing countries and countries with economies in transition148 The number of groups attending UNFCCC meetings is very broad including academic research and business organizations as well as those seeking a total phrase out of fossil fuels and those representing the fossil fuel industry149 Some organizations appear to attend solely to perform public demonstrations opposing the use of fossil fuels150 Regional Fisheries Management Organizations

WCPFC13-2016-OP07,82,The InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC promotes transparency in its decisionmaking through among other things facilitating consultations with and the effective participation of nongovernmental organizations representatives of the fishing industry particularly the fishing fleet and other interested bodies and individuals159 To that end IGOs whose work is relevant to the implementation of this Convention and nonParties interested in conservation and sustainable use of the fish stocks may participate in meetings of the Commission160 In addition NGOsincluding environmental organizations with recognized experience in matters pertaining to the Commission and the tuna industry of any of the members of the Commission operating in the Convention Area particularly the tuna fishing fleetmay also participate in meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies as observers161 A small but diverse group of observers have participated in IATTC meetings including those from environmental organizations the seafood industry fishing associations aquaculture associations and research organizations162
WCPFC13-2016-OP07,83,The convention establishing the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ICCAT does not specifically include provisions for observer participation although it does specify that the Commission should cooperate with other international fisheries commissions and scientific organizations that might contribute to the work of the Commission163 It also allows the Commission to invite any appropriate international CCSBT Rules of Procedure supra note 66 at Rule 31b 2011 CCSBT Attendance at Meetings by Observers supra note 64 As of September 2015 5 intergovernmental organizations and 4 nongovernmental organizations had been granted longterm observer status with the CCSBT Id CCSBT Rules of Procedure supra note 66 at Rule 32 Id at Rule 31 Id at Rule 33 CCSBT Attendance at Meetings by Observers supra note 64 CCSBT Rules of Procedure supra note 66 at Rule 33 Id Antigua Convention supra note 22 at art XVI1 Id at art XVI2 Annex 2 1 Id at art XVI2 See eg IATTC MINUTES OF THE 87TH MEETING OF THE INTERAMERICAN TROPICAL TUNA COMMISSION RESUMED 8 2014 at httpwwwiattcorgMeetingsMeetings2014OCTPDFsIATTC872Minutespdf ICCAT Convention supra note 21 at art XI2 Transparency in International Agreements IELP Nov 10 2016

WCPFC13-2016-OP07,85,However the ICCAT members have addressed NGO participation through the Guidelines and Criteria for Granting Observer Status at ICCAT Meetings166 These Guidelines allow NGOs that support the objectives of ICCAT and with demonstrated interest in the species under the purview of ICCAT to be eligible to participate as observers in all meetings and subsidiary bodies except extraordinary meetings held in executive sessions or meetings of heads of delegations167 ICCAT considers applications as accepted unless onethird of Contracting Parties object in writing at least 30 days before the meeting or within 60 days of receipt of an application if that is more than 30 days before to the meeting168 Although not reflected in the ICCAT Observer Guidelines and Criteria once an NGO has had its application for observer status approved it does not need to apply again169 The Executive Secretary may limit the number of observers per NGO that may attend a meeting due to logistical constraints170 As with the IATTC a small but diverse range of observers attend ICCAT meetings171

WCPFC13-2016-OP08,4,Recommendations to the 13th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission
WCPFC13-2016-OP08,5,The International Game Fish Association IGFA is a nonprofit organization that represents recreational anglers throughout the world IGFA was established in 1939 has active members in over 100 countries is the governing body for international recreational fishing and provides rules for ethical angling practices Many of IGFAs members target the highly migratory species managed by WCPFC especially marlin sailfish and spearfish ie billfish which are primarily caught and released
WCPFC13-2016-OP08,6,IGFA has great concern about how highly migratory species are being managed on a global level for recreational anglers The lack of data and accurate reporting on billfish catch is of particular concern As an organization that is committed to the conservation of game fishes IGFA has deployed over 250 popup satellite archival tags in marlin around the world in the past three years many of which have been in waters under this organizations purview The information gained from this exercise is available to your scientific committee
WCPFC13-2016-OP08,7,Billfish Although primarily a commercial bycatch species billfish are highly sought after recreational species that are primarily caught and released We urge the WCPFC to set a target reference rate above BMSY for recreational anglers The WCNPO stock of striped marlin is overfished and experiencing overfishing Reducing fishing mortality would likely increase spawning stock biomass and may improve the chances of higher recruitment We recommend fishing at a constant catch of 2500 mt that would lead to potential increases in spawning biomass of 133 to 223 by 2017 No formal stock assessments exist for sailfish and black marlin Better data collection is necessary for these species so that their true abundance can be accurately estimated IGFA further recommends implementing a prohibition on Pacific billfish entering into international trade Similar legislation has recently been passed at the request of IGFA in the United States that now bans importation of marlin sailfish and spearfish into the continental United States We also recommend all countries be required to report dead discards and use circle hooks in their longline fisheries
WCPFC13-2016-OP08,8,Bluefin Tuna The 2016 stock assessment indicates that Pacific Bluefin tuna have been reduced to less than 3 of their virgin biomass Yet management measure recommended by the Northern Committee fail to end overfishing giving the stock less than a 1 chance or recovering under this management regime As such these actions are insufficient to address the status of Pacific bluefin tuna and will result in the stock remaining in a severely depleted condition for at least another decade The IGFA recommends a minimum of a one year moratorium on commercial harvest subject to extension until the Commission develops meaningful management measures that will immediately end overfishing and begin rebuilding the stock to a healthy level in reasonable amount of time IGFA recommends implementing target and limit reference points that increases spawning stock biomass to 20 of virgin biomass in eight years and to 40 of virgin biomass by 2030

WCPFC13-2016-OP08,11,FADs The increasing use of FADs in tuna purse seine fisheries has become a global issue IGFA urges the Commission to enact measures to reduce the harvest of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna FAD associated purse seine fisheries IGFA also recommends enhanced data collection on FAD fisheries including unique coding of individual FADs
WCPFC13-2016-OP08,12,IUU Transhipment at sea facilitates IUU fishing and the IGFA recommends that the WCPFC ban all forms of transhipment at sea until it can be demonstrated that such operations are not contributing to IUU fishing Sharks IGFA recommends the Commission adopt a complete prohibition of wire traces in longline fisheries to reduce the catch of imperilled shark species General Recreational angling is an established and important economic entity in developed countries and a growing one in many developing nations As such we wish that WCPFC recognize both its relevance and that it may necessitate alternate management objectives than those used in commercial fisheries IGFA kindly offers its consultation to WCPFC on recreational fisheries issues
WCPFC13-2016-OP08,13,Managing fisheries on the basis of MSY is an excessively riskprone approach As such we suggest that WCPFC adopt a target objective above BMSY to compensate for biological environmental and data uncertainties Many recreational fisheries are catch and release in nature where anglers prefer to catch more and bigger fish than to necessarily harvest fish In addition to its inherent uncertainty managing stocks on the level of MSY not only reduces the abundance of fish but also their average size Maintaining stocks at higher abundances benefits recreational anglers that release their fish and also contributes to the substantial economic value of these fisheries We feel this is especially true with bycatch species such as marlin and sailfish that have little commercial value but great economic value to recreational anglers

WCPFC13-2016-OP09,3,Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Thirteenth Regular Session of the Commission WCPFC13 Nadi Fiji 59 December 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP09,4,Greenpeace welcomes the opportunity to attend the 13th meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC as an observer In addition to this paper Greenpeace asks the Commission to note the statement and recommendations made to SC12 in Bali this year1 Building a skyscraper without foundations The Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPO and those who depend on its fish face a growing crisis The WCPFC is failing to deliver on its most basic objectives of ensuring fisheries for future generations In the worst examples key species have been fished down to critically low levels just 26 of the Pacific bluefin tuna 16 of bigeye tuna and 12 of North Pacific striped marlin populations remain There is little optimism for their recovery to healthy levels in a reasonable timeframe given the WCPFCs sustained track record of failing to agree adequate management plans and to ensure all Member and Cooperating Nonmembers States follow the rules Unfortunately it is clear from the positions adopted by many WCPFC Members that they show little interest in addressing these failures Getting back to basics Managing the variety of tuna billfish and shark fisheries taking place in such a vast ocean region as the WCPO is a complicated endeavour As a result WCPFC rules and the work carried out by the Commission are increasingly sophisticated and complex The amount of analysis carried out by the different supporting institutions in the region is massive This includes a heavy workload for scientists managers and administrative staff However in contrast to this increasing complexity and workload the basic elements required for successful management of fisheries in the region are absent Over the last few years fishing capacity and effort have continued to increase the analysis carried out by WCPFC Scientific SC and Technical and Compliance Committees TCC are plagued with references to data gaps as basic requirements for data provision and observer coverage are not met and there are clearly few if any deterrents for those who fail to comply with the rules Any progress being made fades in comparison with the consequences of these failures Basic elements of sound fisheries management include The availability of accurate and detailed data on the operations of fishing fleets The mechanisms to ensure that fishing capacity and effort are managed effectively including taking into account all factors which contribute to them Clear rules on biomass and fishing mortality limits and actions to be taken when these limits are exceeded Strict compliance with legal requirements both under the Convention and International Law Deterrent consequences for the lack of compliance with the above mentioned requirements Transparency in the work of the Commission allowing engagement of all stakeholders and civil society in particular A lack of data undermines all levels of management Year after year it is clear that key data to inform the work of the Commission is either not being collected or not being reported While improvements are being made progress is slow Data gaps have three main causes Data is not provided to the Commission despite existing obligations in that regard This includes operational catch and effort data2 transhipment practices3 observer coverage4 and data on shark catches5 Data is not provided or provided in an inconsistent manner due to unclear provisions This includes observer data6 or data on certain important species7 Poor clarity on provisions critical to data collection also affects observer coverage itself see below Data is not provided because it is not mandatory to do so even if such data are of critical importance to managing fisheries An example of this is the lack of complete information on the management of fishing capacity where accurate data are not required on most factors essential to assessing the efficiency of fishing vessels All of this has obvious implications on the management of fish stocks under the purview of the Commission and in its ability to evaluate the performance of agreed conservation and management measures for both target and bycatch species Undermining rules and data collection Independent observers on board fishing vessels collect vital data for science and detect non compliance for managers Conversely transhipment at sea undermines oversight of fisheries and facilitates human rights and labour violations in some of these fisheries The requirement for a minimum of 5 observer coverage on longliners has been in place since with a deadline of implementation on 20128 However even this low level is not being met9 and there are issues with the way such coverage is defined so that the levels reported by different fleets are inconsistent10 While observer coverage on purse seiners is 100 some reporting problems still need to be addressed11 Even if the required 5 level was met it is not considered high enough for the data collected to be statistically useful for assessing bycatch impacts scientists recommend a minimum of 20 coverage12 More concerning is that electronic monitoring may now be seen as a way to reach 5 coverage rather than a way to complement and enhance the current requirement to a much higher and more scientifically useful level13 Finally observer safety remains a problem in fisheries worldwide including at WCPFC Provisions agreed at WCPFC12 go some way to addressing concerns but without the means and tools for observers to increase their safety clarity on the responsibilities of flag States to deal with observer safety concerns and transparency in how incidents of bribery harassment and violence are reported and dealt with there remain considerable risks to observers and therefore the quality of data gathered by the observer programme Transhipment at sea continues to undermine the monitoring control and surveillance of fishing operations in the region14 Despite the requirement for observers aboard transport vessels to monitor transhipment reporting requirements for observer data for monitoring high seas transhipments have not been agreed and some data are being submitted on a voluntary basis and in a range of different formats15 Existing data from transhipments indicate a failure to comply with the prohibition of sharkfinning16 and while transhipment plays a role inadequate reporting provisions can mask sharkfinning practices17 Although it seems to have been the intention of the Commission to restrict high seas transhipment18 it allows exceptions and it is clear that particular members are determined to continue to make widespread use of this With almost half of the vessels in the region authorised to tranship in the high seas WCPFC should question to what extent an activity can be considered exceptional19 Transhipment also facilitates human rights and labour abuses by allowing vessels to remain at sea for long periods with little or no oversight or ability for crew to report concerns an issue that receives increasing public scrutiny but which WCPFC has not yet addressed Lack of transparency facilitates lack of compliance Strict deterrent consequences for the lack of compliance by Members and Cooperating Non Members and their vessels are required to ensure management measures are achieved Furthermore the availability of information on how compliance is monitored on noncompliance reporting and on the actions taken to deal with those responsible enables public evaluation and creates an added incentive for compliance due to a desire to avoid the adverse reputational and economic repercussions of breaking the rules The WCPFC suffers from substantial transparency problems that prevent meaningful participation of the public and observers non and intergovernmental organisations in its work with resulting inadequate incentives for compliance20 This recurring problem particularly with regard to closed sessions during TCC meetings has triggered a series of interventions and joint letters from NGOs in the recent past This goes against the transparency requirements detailed in the Convention21 and Rules of Procedures22 in addition to wellestablished best practice at RFMOs23 other Regional Fisheries Bodies and other international environmental agreements24 Fishing capacity must be reduced The everincreasing level of fishing capacity and effort25 in the region represents a fundamental failure to meet the Convention requirement to take measures to prevent or eliminate overfishing and excess fishing capacity and to ensure that levels of fishing effort do not exceed those commensurate with the sustainable use of fishery resources26 The increase in vessel numbers and other components of fishing capacity and effort in the region such as FADs and their role in increasing catch rates is a result of key decisions being left in the hands of private fishing companies Recent analysis on the purse seine sector demonstrates that overcapacity is substantial27 Without detailed information on fishing capacity and effort it is hard to ensure that fishing is kept within sustainable limits28 It is of great concern that after public commitments in 2009 by developed nations under the Kobe process29 to freeze their fishing capacity even though poorly defined as vessel numbers the WCPO fleet has continued to increase in terms of both number of vessels and vessel size30 with obvious implications in these fisheries31 In the WCPO 131 of the purse seiners and 428 of the longliners on the WCPFC Registered Vessel List were built after 200932 It is no less concerning that after such controversy over FADs many basic facts on their numbers and use remain unknown Appropriate data must be collected to measure and manage fishing capacity The purse seine industry has successfully opposed precautionary measures on FAD use with the excuse of the lack of information to determine suitable measures introducing instead socalled FAD Management Plans that should at a minimum provide the information required for informed management in the future The reality is that we still lack this data33 due both to the poor design of FAD management plans and to their requirements not being met34 The result overfishing and ecosystem impacts Pacific bluefin has been fished down to just 26 of its unfished population size35 and bigeye tuna to 1636 North Pacific striped marlin has been in a poor state for over 30 years now at just 12 with no action taken for recovery of the population37 Some other billfish populations are also significantly depleted South Pacific albacore continues to decline38 and the persistently low and declining average catch rates are likely to continue to undermine vessel profitability and may force some operators out of the fishery39 Again and in contravention to the precautionary approach enshrined in the WCPFC convention40 insufficient data is often cited as an excuse for further delaying the already slow process of agreeing harvest strategies for target species and often by members who are failing to meet their own data requirements However the continuing failure of the WCPFC to agree adequate measures without the preagreed goals and rules of harvest strategies means that further delaying this process is a continued threat to fish stocks41 Oceanic whitetip shark42 and silky shark43 populations have been devastated by both longliners and purse seiners and not enough data is available to assess other key shark species44 Meanwhile WCPFC parties continue to resist developing even the most basic Shark Management Plans Threatened albatrosses petrels and sea turtles continue to be killed as bestpractice bycatch mitigation measures are still not in place and again observer coverage and reporting requirements are not good enough to collect accurate data on these species WCPFC must address urgent data and compliance issues The following list encompasses priorities that must be addressed to ensure that further work by the SC and TCC and measures developed by WCPFC will not continue to be undermined Greenpeace calls on the Commission to Strengthen mandatory reporting requirements to ensure that fishing capacity and effort in all tuna billfish and shark fisheries are adequately measured and reported so as to allow for the best performance of the SC and a sound basis for Conservation and Management Measures Impose deterrent sanctions for cases of noncompliance to ensure that States comply with all their data reporting requirements such as No Data No Fishing measures of the type recently agreed at the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission IOTC45 Improve transparency and compliance by removing barriers to NGO and IGO observer access to the compliance monitoring processes and relevant documents and meetings Require a clearlydefined representative 20 observer coverage on longline fleets Where human onboard observers are not feasible for certain fleets or vessel sizes other alternatives such as electronic monitoring systems must be assessed and put in place subject to minimum technical requirements that ensure the reliability of the system These must not prevent the much needed increase in human observer coverage starting with ensuring that existing obligations are met Ensure the health and safety of all observers by developing robust safety and security measures and transparent reporting mechanisms for infractions and actions taken against any operators or crew members that harass intimidate harm or in any way prevent observers from performing their duties Improve and align vessel databases and the information fields they contain to ensure good data availability for capacity assessment Phase out all transhipment at sea In the interim all transhipment must have observers on board both the fishing and carrier vessels Any violation detected in transhipment must result in the loss of transhipment authorisation Consider FADs in context of capacity management and prioritise the collection of data on the number of FADs and the associated technology used and abandoned or lost by vessels in order to assess effort creep associated with FAD use and their impacts on juvenile tuna and shark populations Develop measures to improve the quality and quantity of data recorded and reported for all sharks caught including mobula and manta rays including details of the species gear types used and the condition of each animal on release dead injured alive This must include a requirement that all sharks are landed with their fins naturally attached Failure to report on shark catches should result in a ban on using sharkspecific gear and on retention of sharks Adopt the tiered approach to the development of shark management plans by all States as recommended by the paper presented at SC and TCC46

WCPFC13-2016-OP11,3,November 30 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP11,4,To Members Cooperating NonMembers and Participating Territories of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission
WCPFC13-2016-OP11,5,Dear Delegates
WCPFC13-2016-OP11,6,Our companies represent major US seafood buyers that source seafood products from a diverse international supply network including from the Western and Central Pacific Ocean a region for which your government serves as an important leader as a member of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Commission Our companies purchase a variety of tuna products from member countries and we recognize that the sustainability of tuna stocks is integral to our businesses as well as the health of the marine environment
WCPFC13-2016-OP11,7,We recognize that the Commission has made some initial progress in recent years to establish basic sciencebased management measures to ensure the sustainability of the worlds largest tuna fishery in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean Specifically in 2015 the Commission committed itself to develop and implement a sixpart harvest strategy approach for each of the key fisheries or stocks under its management including a work plan with clear timelines We support this initial action and encourage the Commission to apply the Precautionary Approach using clear target and limit reference points and harvest control rules as called for by the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement
WCPFC13-2016-OP11,8,As you prepare for the upcoming 13th Regular Session of the Commission we urge your government to support the full implementation of the work plan for harvest strategies including timelines to adopt appropriate biologicallybased target reference points harvest control rules and the other elements of the harvest strategy approach for skipjack bigeye yellowfin and south Pacific albacore tuna In particular we urge you to ensure that the Commission takes decisions necessary this year eg agree on acceptable levels of risk a rebuilding timeframe for bigeye tuna and management objectives for south Pacific albacore skipjack bigeye and yellowfin to allow management strategy evaluation and other work to proceed as scheduled in 2017 In addition we request your support for proposals that would establish precautionary target reference points for skipjack and south Pacific albacore In order to optimize harvest control rules for all tuna stocks in the future we suggest that the Commission request regular updates from your scientific advisors regarding reference points and performance indicators and consider a monitoring scheme
WCPFC13-2016-OP11,9,Finally we are very concerned with the severely depleted population of Pacific bluefin tuna including the lack of action to recover the population to sustainable levels and no progress in the development of harvest strategies Given the dire condition of the stock we urge all delegates to ensure that steps are taken in 2017 to establish a precautionary management framework and a rebuilding plan that will recover the population to levels that can achieve maximum sustainable yield in accordance with CMM 201406 and the Convention respectively
WCPFC13-2016-OP11,10,Thank you for your consideration of these requests

WCPFC13-2016-OP12,4,Mr Guillermo Morn IATTC Chair Ministerio de Agricultura Ganadera Acuacultura y Pesca y Calle 12 Manta Manabi Ecuador November 2016 Dear Ms MossChristian and Mr Morn Pacific bluefin tuna PBF have the unfortunate distinction of being the worlds most depleted tuna population in history and the species now faces a serious threat of extinctioni Decades of overfishing have decimated the stock pushing it down to just 26 of its unfished levelii Despite the clear scientific evidence that the species is in a dire situation both domestic and international fisheries managers are failing to protect Pacific bluefin tuna We the undersigned 58 scientists call for a moratorium on commercial Pacific bluefin fishing until the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC and InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC improve their management of the species by ending overfishing and adopting a basinwide rebuilding plan with a sciencebased precautionary rebuilding target and deadline We join a growing number of experts who have recognized the serious situation that PBF is in due to a lack of effective management In June 2016 an independent performance review of IATTC stated By any measure this stock is in serious troublePacific Bluefin has been fished to a very low level and needs urgent joint WCPFC and IATTC management actioniii Fourteen organizations recently submitted a petition to the US government to list the Pacific bluefin tuna as endangered under the Endangered Species Act citing its severely overfished state continuing overfishing and the very real risk of extinction The US government has determined that listing may be warranted and is now conducting a full status review of the species In Japan a group of artisanal fishermen who target PBF have voluntarily suspended fishing during the summer spawning seasoniv Unfortunately other governments have not followed these leads WCPFC took no additional action at its 2015 meeting and IATTC took no additional action at its 2016 meetings despite the known crisis facing PBT Until very recently there was no international management of this highly migratory stock whose migrations of thousands of miles take it through the waters of many fishing nations In 2014 WCPFC adopted a rebuilding target of the historical median biomass However because the stock had been overfished for almost the entire period they defined as historical the target equates to just 64 of the unfished levelv This is well below the commonly recommended rebuilding target of 2040 of unfished levels and is utterly inadequate to return the population to healthy levelsvi As part of this insufficient rebuilding plan WCPFC adopted a 50 reduction in the catch limits for small PBF however loopholes in the measure allowed several countries to increase their catchvii Furthermore neither Commission has adopted target or limit reference points The lack of effective management measures means that high levels of fishing continue to put pressure on the severely depleted population with fishing rates up to three times higher than sustainable levelsviii Nearly 98 of Pacificwide catch is composed of juveniles that have not yet reproduced a blatant case of growth overfishingix At the other end of the lifecycle adults are targeted by an industrial purse seine fleet when they are aggregated on the spawning grounds an illadvised practice that reduces reproductive success by disturbing spawning and selectively removing large spawning adults leading to reduced maximum yield and loss of genetic diversityx Adding to the management failures there continues to be a lack of transparency in the scientific process that is out of step with standard practices in international fisheries science The first publically available stock assessment report was not released by the overseeing scientific body the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and TunaLike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC until 2012 The ISC still does not allow independent observers to attend or participate in their stock assessment meetings and non government scientists must be invited in order to attend where their participation is severely limited Meeting reports can take six months or longer to be approved and released to the public often delaying needed action As scientists who are concerned about the dire state of the Pacific bluefin population we urge PBF fishing nations to immediately implement a moratorium on commercial PBF fishing until appropriate sciencebased management measures and a basinwide rebuilding plan with an appropriately precautionary target are in place We also call for full transparency in the scientific process including opening ISC working group meetings to observers and making meeting documents publicly available in a timely fashion Decisive action is now critical Sincerely Octavio AburtoOropeza PhD Associate Professor of Marine Biology Scripps Institution of Oceanography

WCPFC13-2016-OP13,6,We would like to take this opportunity to welcome the convening of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC in December and to wish success to this body in achieving the sustainable management of the fisheries within its jurisdiction
WCPFC13-2016-OP13,7,We note that there have been efforts in the past to promote measures that will facilitate sustainable management of tuna and that there is considerable interest in the creation and implementation of harvest strategies for tuna species We also note that the creation of such strategies is a complex undertaking involving the definition of objectives target and limit reference points and the acceptable risks of breaching them a monitoring strategy harvest control rules and other elements It is inevitable that such an undertaking will be time consuming and this delay allows unsustainable fishing to continue an undesirable situation which members of the WCPFC may consider frustrating
WCPFC13-2016-OP13,8,We also note that the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement1 requires regional fishery management organisations such as the WCPFC in the absence of appropriate data to implement precautionary measures to avoid the overfishing of target stocks the unacceptable depletion of bycatch species or damage to the wider ecosystem It is our Agreement for the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks Annex II Guidelines for the application of precautionary reference points in conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks understanding that member nations of the WCPFC are signatories to this agreement
WCPFC13-2016-OP13,9,We therefore wish to recommend a strategy that will meet the desire to create effective harvest strategies for tuna in a timely manner while also meeting the requirements of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement Specifically we would like to suggest that the WCPFC adopts a set of interim target and limit reference points for all target tuna stocks and key bycatch species where these are not currently in place These interim targets should be in place within the next 12 months
WCPFC13-2016-OP13,10,The value in this approach is that it provides management to the relevant fisheries but does not interfere with existing work plans to create speciesspecific reference points The development of all the required elements of the comprehensive harvest strategies would continue in parallel with the interim targets As each speciesspecific reference point was completed it would replace the interim target and limit reference points
WCPFC13-2016-OP13,11,We suggest that the selection of appropriate interim reference points be based on existing reference points for the same or similar species in either Regional Fishery Management Organisation RFMO or exclusive economic zone EEZ management regimes around the world We note that such interim reference points may need to be made somewhat more precautionary than speciesspecific reference points
WCPFC13-2016-OP13,12,This approach will offer considerable assistance to the ambitions of the WCPFC It allows for a faster introduction of appropriate management to these important fisheries through the use of interim reference points while simultaneously supporting the development of permanent strategies and enhancing the credibility of the WCPFC as an institution that can deliver significant results over a meaningful timescale
WCPFC13-2016-OP13,13,We respectfully ask that you consider this recommendation in the course of your deliberations in December
WCPFC13-2016-OP13,14,Yours sincerely

WCPFC13-2016-OP16,6,POSITION STATEMENT SHARK RAY CONSERVATION MEASURES th Regular Session of the WESTERN CENTRAL PACIFIC FISHERIES COMMISSION Denarau Island Fiji December 59 2016
WCPFC13-2016-OP16,7,Our organizations appreciate delegates consideration of our views on proposals currently before the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC with respect to the conservation of sharks and rays We focus on these species because of the low reproductive capacity that leaves most of them exceptionally vulnerable to overexploitation
WCPFC13-2016-OP16,8,EU PROPOSAL ON MOBULID RAYS Manta and devil rays family Mobulidae are the least fecund fish taken in tuna fisheries with females giving birth to as few as one pup every two to three years A particularly cautious approach is warranted with respect to both handling of individuals and management of fishing mortality With all mobulid rays now listed on Appendix I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species CMS and Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species CITES Parties intentions and obligations to safeguard these particularly vulnerable species are mounting Specifically CMS Parties are required to strictly protect mobulids while CITES Parties are obligated to restrict international manta ray trade to that which can be demonstrated to be the result of sustainable and legal fishing through nondetriment findings We strongly support the EUs proposal aimed at safe live release of manta and devil rays and urge Parties to agree accordingly to prohibit retention landing sale storage and transshipment as well as harmful practices gaffing lifting by gill slits or spiracles punching holes in wings mandate prompt and careful release according to safe handling guidelines ensure that numbers of discarded and released mobulids as well as their status are recorded and reported to the WCPFC and add mobulid rays as WCPFC key shark species for assessment etc EU PROPOSAL ON SHARK FINNING We applaud the EU for leadership toward prohibiting atsea shark fin removal the best practice for enforcing bans on shark finning slicing off a sharks fins and discarding the body at sea Such finsattached policies can ease enforcement improve speciesspecific catch data and prevent highgrading EU fishermen are using this method for frozen as well as fresh sharks Concerns about safety and storage can be addressed by partially cutting and folding fins against the body Because of its many practical advantages the finsattached method is being mandated in a growing number of countries and is gaining acceptance in international arenas the policy was adopted by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization in 2014 and 2016 respectively and supported by 80 of Parties to the International Commission for Conservation of Atlantic Tunas last month
WCPFC13-2016-OP16,9,We urge Parties to adopt a prohibition on the removal of shark fins onboard vessels as well as the retention transshipment and landing of shark fins that are not naturally attached to carcasses without exceptions

WCPFC13-2016-OP21,8,The World Tuna Purse Seine Organization WTPO members who are your partners in developing the tuna fishery so that this God given resource is utilized in an efficient and sustainable way would like to express their concern on the following issues Fishing Capacity Control
WCPFC13-2016-OP21,9,WTPO continue to support capacity control with no exemption in the convention area and in all oceans and the need to establish a capacity transfer arrangement in response to the aspirations of SIDS to develop their respective fishery Definition of Fish Aggregate DeviceFAD
WCPFC13-2016-OP21,10,WTPO requests the WCPFC to review the current definition of Fish Aggregate Device FAD and consider the adoption of the IATTC definition of Fish Aggregate Device FAD in order to prevent any misunderstanding to a legal fishing activity andor unnecessary arguments between fishing operator and observer on board
WCPFC13-2016-OP21,11,IATTC FAD Definition FishAggregating Device FAD means anchored drifting floating or submerged objects deployed andor tracked by vessels including through the use of radio andor satellite buoys for the purpose of aggregating target tuna species for purseseine fishing operations

WCPFC13-2016-OP21,13,While observers on board purse seine vessels have played significant roles in the management of the fishery there is a need to address issues on individual differences misbehaviors and misunderstanding of rules that can lead to misreporting and the need to act on every incident in a timely manner WTPO would like to propose the creation of a working group within the Commission and work with vessel operators in order to establish a mechanism of reporting and action on reports taking into consideration the welfare of the observer as well as the right of the fishermen and the authority of the licensing State as well as the responsibility of the Flag State

WCPFC14-2017-OP01,6,What are the issues
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,7,Effective management measures consistent with advice from the WCPFC Scientific Committee are needed to ensure bigeye yellowfin and skipjack tuna fishing mortality is maintained at sustainable levels Why are we concerned
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,8,While the 2017 WCPO bigeye stock assessment is more positive than in recent years active management needs to continue because there is still a good chance 16 that the stock is below the adopted Limit Reference Point LRP Further the Scientific Committee advised that the amount of uncertainty in the stock status results for the assessment is higher than for the previous assessment due to the inclusion of new information on bigeye growth and regional structures The 2017 yellowfin assessment indicates that the stock is not overfished or being overfished Regarding skipjack tuna there was no new stock assessment in 2017 The 2016 reference case assessment shows that the stock is around the interim Target Reference Point TRP adopted by WCPFC However without an effective means for limiting fishing capacity fishing effort could increase in the near future
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,9,Position Statement 201704 Published October 19 2017 WESTERN AND CENTRAL PACIFIC FISHERIES COMMISSION WCPFC MEETING DECEMBER 37 2017 Our Top Asks for WCPFC in 2017 Adopt effective and enforceable tuna conservation measures for all fleets to avoid an increase in fishing mortality of bigeye and yellowfin tuna Accelerate the development of harvest strategies for all key tuna species per the WCPFC Harvest Strategy Work Plan Increase the level of longline observer coverage to and finalize the development of the EMER standards for both longline and purse seine so that EM can be used to ultimately achieve 100 observer coverage in longline fisheries as well as the current requirement for the purse seine fishery Adopt sciencebased FAD management measures including the use of nonentangling FAD designs Reform the WCPFC compliance assessment process to allow accredited observer participation ISSF Position Statement 2017 Page 2 8
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,10,What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,11,Consistent with the advice of the Scientific Committee WCPFC should ensure the new tuna conservation measure 1 Ensures fishing mortality on the bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks does not increase from current levels to maintain current or increased spawning biomass until the Commission can agree on appropriate TRPs 2 Reduces fishing mortality in fisheries that take juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna 3 Adjusts fishing effort fishing days in the purse seine fishery to levels that will maintain skipjack around the TRP preferably through a Harvest Control Rule

WCPFC14-2017-OP01,13,M O N I T O R I N G M A N A G E M E N T
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,14,What are the issues
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,15,More data needs to be collected regarding the number of FADs being used and the details of fishing operations on individual FADs to better understand fishing capacity changes and likely impacts on WCPFCmanaged stocks That data should be used to develop sciencebased FAD management measures Also supply vessel activities related to drifting FADs increase the efficiency of the purse seiner by reducing the time needed by the purse seiner to search for or maintain FADs Greater data collection is needed regarding supply vessels as well as regulation and monitoring Further ISSF welcomed the creation of a WCPFC Working Group on FAD management options in 2014 and was pleased to participate in the 2015 and 2016 meetings Why are we concerned
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,16,In the WCPO FAD sets account for about 30 of tropical tuna catches Its time for a concerted global effort to better monitor and manage FAD usage in every ocean region Shark mortality and other FADfishing ecosystem impacts in the WCPO need to be reduced using nonentangling FAD designs and moving towards biodegradable FADs are critical steps What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,17,1 Adopt the Scientific Committee recommendations to add a new section of FAD Information in the ROP Minimum Standard Data Fields that will include inventories of the FAD buoys on board at the start and end of each trip and field for FAD Identification
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,18,2 Adopt the proposed text in the Rev5 of the Draft Bridging Measure for Tropical Tunas either as part of the tuna measure or as a standalone CMM that would require the design and deployment of nonentangling FADs as of 1 January 2019 and encourages further research on nonentangling and biodegradable materials
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,19,3Urgently adopt measures for the management of FADs in the WCPO such as sciencebased limits on FAD deployments andor FAD sets and require that FAD buoy tracking data be provided to the Scientific Committee with appropriate time lags to ensure confidentiality
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,20,4 With respect to supply and tender vessels i Ensure any FAD management measures fully cover supply and tender vessels ISSF Position Statement 2017 Page 3 8
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,21,ii Adopt the Scientific Committee recommendation that the FAD data fields be reported by supply and tender vessels in addition to fishing vessels iii Collect data on the number and use of supply vessels including identifying which particular purse seine vessels each support and the number of FADs being deployed and serviced by such vessels iv Identify on the Record of Fishing Vessels what activities supply vessels are engaged in whether they are working as bait boats servicing FADs or engaging in fishing v Ensure observer coverage requirements apply to supply vessels so data from these fishing activities are collected and reported
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,22,Harvest Strategies
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,23,What are the issues
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,24,Last year WCPFC adopted an initial set of performance indicators for tropical purse seine fisheries for the purpose of evaluating harvest control rules guidance on estimated levels of risk of breaching a limit reference point and an interim rebuilding time frame for bigeye tuna These actions pave the way for WCPFC to implement a comprehensive harvest strategy that fisheries can follow to ensure stocks are maintained at an optimal level Why are we concerned
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,25,Harvest Strategies which include target and limit reference points together with harvest control rules provide preagreed rules for managing fisheries resources and acting in response to stock status changes It is important to ensure that these pre agreed rules are robust because these rules and strategies help to rebuild stocks or avoid overfishing And they reduce the need for protracted negotiations and delays that can lead to further stock declines What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,26,ISSF urges the Commission to adhere to the updated 2015 harvest strategy work plan and take the decisions necessary this year eg a target reference point for yellowfin tuna and South Pacific albacore and development of harvest control rules for skipjack bigeye South Pacific albacore and yellowfin tuna to allow MSE and other work to proceed as scheduled in 2018

WCPFC14-2017-OP01,29,What are the issues In 2016 the Scientific Committee recommended that the Commission reconsider CMM 201007 that allows CCMs to exclude one mitigation technique either wire trace or sharklines because it has the potential to severely weaken effectiveness This year the Scientific Committee recommended further work on the Shark Research Plan and safe release guidelines for rays The Scientific Committee also noted that the WCPFC has not yet adopted guidelines for the safe release of silky and oceanic whitetip sharks ISSF Position Statement 2017 Page 4 8
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,30,Why are we concerned Shark lines are used in many fisheries and these catch mostly silky and oceanic whitetip sharks whose retention is prohibited in the WCPFC Additionally requiring sharks be landed with fins naturally attached is the best way to monitor compliance with finning bans given low observer coverage rates in some fisheries while collecting speciesspecific data on shark catches that is vital to the longterm conservation and management of shark populations
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,31,What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Adopt the SC12 recommendations on sharks to prohibit the use of shark lines in order to improve compliance
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,32,2 Adopt the SC13 recommended Shark Research Plan and future work plan and the safe release guidelines for rays 3 Adopt a CMM to require that sharks be landed with fins still naturally attached to improve compliance and species specific data collection

WCPFC14-2017-OP01,36,What are the issues Comprehensive observer coverage is a critical component of monitoring and management for sustainable tropical tuna fisheries For largescale purse seiners WCPFC implemented a 100 observer coverage requirement Yet the requirement for longline fisheries is only 5 The science committees for IATTC and ICCAT have recommended 20 longline observer coverage a level appropriate to provide reasonable estimates of total bycatch If human onboard observers are not possible for certain fleets or vessel sizes including longliners then guidelines for using electronic monitoring should be adopted ISSF is pleased that in 2016 the WCPFC adopted operational logsheet data standards for electronic reporting and made progress in developing electronic reporting observer data standards Why are we concerned Available data on observer coverage in longline fisheries indicates some fleets are not even meeting the 5 mandatory minimum requirement Observer data can be used for monitoring vessel compliance with management measures The paucity of data on longline catches and interactions with nontarget species prevents assessments hindering scientific input on effective conservation measures
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,37,What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Strengthen CCM compliance with the existing 5 observer coverage requirement by identifying and sanctioning non compliance through the Compliance Committee 2 Increase the level of longline observer coverage to 20 which has been recommended by the scientific committees of IATTC and ICCAT in order to provide reasonable estimates of bycatch and to improve overall monitoring of the fishery 3 Direct the WCPFC Electronic Reporting and Electronic Monitoring Working Group to convene in 2018 to finalize the development of the EMER standards for both longline and purse seine so that EM can be used to ultimately achieve 100 observer coverage in longline fisheries as well as the current requirement for the purse seine fishery ISSF Position Statement 2017 Page 5 8 4 Adopt the Scientific Committee recommendations on electronic reporting and monitoring T R A N S S H I P M E N T What are the issues Members do not provide required transshipment reports or advance notifications ISSF also recognizes that electronic monitoring systems and ereporting are being tested and developed which could potentially be used to address some of these problems Why are we concerned Transshipment at sea can pose a high IUU risk if monitoring control and surveillance MCS measures are insufficient What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do Amend its transshipment measure CMM 200906 in order to address these significant gaps in its effectiveness which affect traceability of the products and could result in IUU fishing P O R T S T A T E M E A S U R E S What are the issues Effective port State measures form an important component of a suite of MCS tools essential to combatting IUU fishing Why are we concerned Port State measures will be most effective if implemented on a regional basis by all those engaged in the fishery and consistent with the standards prescribed in the 2009 FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 For all Members that have not yet done so to ratify the 2009 FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing 2 Adopt a measure to give effect to it at a regional level T R A N S P A R E N C Y I N C A T C H O R E F F O R T L I M I T S What are the issues WCPFC has adopted catch or effort limits for bigeye yellowfin skipjack and albacore tunas However during a given year there is no transparent mechanism for Member reporting when the total andor allocated catch or effort limits are being approached and if Members are within the prescribed limits This mechanism would allow RFMO CCMs and markets to make necessary conservation decisions during a given year if quotas are being achieved more quickly than anticipated ISSF Position Statement 2017 Page 6 8
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,38,Why are we concerned A lack of monitoring how Members are approaching or possibly exceeding annual individual catch or effort limits for particular tuna stocks or a total allowable catch or total allowable effort for a specific tuna stocks prevents rapid and precautionary conservation management and purchasing decisions within a given year What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do Transparently report its inseason catch or effort status with respect to their Individual catch or effort limits andor annual TACs or TAEs where specified
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,39,Compliance
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,40,C O M P L I A N C E P R O C E S S E S
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,41,What are the issues In contrast to the other four tuna RFMOs the WCPFC Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS working group is closed to accredited observers Further the responses of Members to identified noncompliance are not released publicly Member reports on the implementation of WCPFC measures known as Part II reports also remain confidential Members must recognize that a strong compliance process improves fisheries management In addition the WCPFC does not yet have a scheme of responses to noncompliance
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,42,Why are we concerned The CMS working group reviews and assesses Members implementation of critical WCFPC conservation measures and determines if there has been noncompliance And the group considers if measures are unclear or if other factors are causing gaps in full implementation Transparency in this process through the participation of accredited observers is essential for this work to be considered fair and trustworthy If compliance discussions take place behind closed doors with no openness or checks on accountability the public and market can have little confidence in the sustainable management of the regions fisheries What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Reform its CMS process so that accredited observers may attend the working group meetings and information on CCMs plans to address the areas of identified noncompliance be made public 2 Develop a scheme of responses to noncompliance as soon as possible Capacity Management

WCPFC14-2017-OP01,45,Why are we concerned ISSF continues to be concerned with the global growth of fishing capacity in WCPFC Fishing fleet overcapacity increases pressure to weaken management measures and eventually it leads to stock overexploitation
WCPFC14-2017-OP01,46,What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Establish limited entry through closed vessel registries and develop a common currency to measure fishing capacity such as cubic meters of well volume 2 To impose and enforce as a precautionary measure measures to limit longliner capacity in the Convention Area and task the SC to make recommendations regarding the levels of longline capacity consistent with sustainable management of target tuna stocks 3 Support the Kobe III call for creating mechanisms to transfer capacity to developing countries

WCPFC14-2017-OP02,6,This letter is submitted on behalf of the undersigned companies nongovernmental organizations and fishing industry associations all of whom recognise that the sustainability of tuna stocks is integral to businesses and livelihoods as well as the health of the marine environment
WCPFC14-2017-OP02,7,Our companies represent major seafood buyers that source seafood products from a diverse international supply network Our nongovernmental organizations work in more than 100 countries and engage suppliers and provide advice to retailers buyers and food service sectors regarding improvements in tuna sustainability Our fishing industry associations represent a variety of gear types including purse seine longline troll pole and line and handline vessels active in tuna fisheries worldwide
WCPFC14-2017-OP02,8,Your government serves as an important leader as a member of one or more of the four regional fisheries management organizations RFMOs charged with managing the worlds tropical tuna fisheries throughout their range We are writing to bring to your attention our views on the development of harvest strategies and the need for strengthened monitoring control and surveillance tools such as 100 observer coverage for purse seine vessels in those RFMOs that do not yet require it and at sea transshipment activities and monitoring and management of fish aggregating devices FADs pressing issues that we believe are fundamental to sustainable fisheries management and those that necessitate immediate action by all tuna RFMOs
WCPFC14-2017-OP02,9,We recognize that certain tuna RFMOs have made some initial progress in recent years to develop harvest strategies including through the establishment of interim target and limit reference points management objectives rebuilding time frames for overfished stocks and conducting management strategy evaluations In addition we observe that some RFMOs such as the IATTC and WCPFC already have 100 observer coverage for large scale purse seine vessels All four tuna RFMOs require at least 5 observer coverage on longline and other types of vessels and some RFMOs are actively developing standards for electronic reporting and monitoring Finally we note that all tuna RFMOs collect some data on FADs and have had working groups consider data needs and management options
WCPFC14-2017-OP02,10,However we wish to underscore that while this initial progress is positive we urge accelerated action at this years RFMO meetings to
WCPFC14-2017-OP02,11,Develop precautionary harvest strategies including specific timelines to adopt target reference points harvest control rules and the other elements of a harvest strategy approach that ensures sustainable fisheries for all tuna stocks
WCPFC14-2017-OP02,12,Adopt a 100 observer coverage requirement for purse seine vessels where it is not already required and of at sea transshipment activities and require the use of the best available observer safety equipment communications and procedures
WCPFC14-2017-OP02,13,Increase compliance with the mandatory 5 longline observer coverage rates by identifying and sanctioning noncompliance and adopt a level of coverage that would reduce uncertainty and provide better estimates of bycatch such as a minimum of 20 which has been recommended by the scientific committees of IATTC and ICCAT
WCPFC14-2017-OP02,14,Adopt standards for electronic reporting and electronic monitoring for all major gear types to enable the implementation of this technology to support robust decision making Adopt effective measures for the use of nonentangling FAD designs as a precautionary measure to minimize the entanglement of sharks and other nontarget species and support research on biodegradable materials and the eventual transition to their use in FADs in order to mitigate marine debris and
WCPFC14-2017-OP02,15,Urgently develop sciencebased recommendations for the management of FADs including how to integrate FAD based information into stock assessments to reduce uncertainties
WCPFC14-2017-OP02,16,We request that your government as a member of one or more of the tuna RFMOs take active steps to ensure significant progress on these issues at each of the relevant RFMO meetings in as a matter of priority

WCPFC14-2017-OP03,8,WWF Position o Mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs o Implement the recommendations for bycatch that were endorsed at Kobe III and adopt an annually updated report card system against these recommendations for all of the WCPFC fisheries o Require through data collected from observer programs and other means estimation of the number of captures and releases of all sharks and rays including the status upon release dead or alive and reporting of this information to the WCPFC and o Require through observer programs recording what gear is used in longline activities including the use of wire traces and any multi monofilament traces in order to avoid biteoff by sharks Designate manta and mobula rays silky shark oceanic whitetip shark and whale shark as Species of Special Interest and reconciles observer data collection requirements for mobulid rays within the existing framework Adopt the riskbased method for shark stock assessment presented by the ABNJ Common Oceans project Consider a nonretention CMM for bigeye thresher shark Alopias Superciliosus within the WCPO Encourage the development of reference points and management for nontarget species including all shark and ray species as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention Encourage CCMs that are Parties to the CMS to develop conservation and management measures in line to meet international obligations and Encourage CCMs to report all shark and ray catches from domestic fleets operating in territorial and archipelagic waters Sea Turtles Sea turtles are some of the most endangered species interacting with tuna fisheries with six out of seven species of sea turtles considered threatened with extinction according to the IUCN Red List WWF is very encouraged that the WCPFC indicates renewed interest in addressing the effectiveness of CMM 200803 for the Conservation and Management of Sea Turtles In particular we acknowledge the outcomes of the first workshop on Joint Analysis of Sea Turtle Mitigation Effectiveness in Longline Fisheries held in Honolulu Hawaii USA from 1619 February 2016 and support the proposed sea turtle analysis initiative WWF also welcomes the assessment of the Common Oceans ABNJ Project for their assessment of effectiveness of current sea turtle mitigation measures in the WCPO It is clear there remains no new evidence that CMM 200803 has demonstrably reduced bycatch impacts on threatened and endangered sea turtles in the region with an estimation of only 1 of WCPO longline effort currently subject to mitigation and thus WWF maintains that this CMM must be revised immediately with interim measures We note with interest the commentary in the WCPFCSPC report following the Hawaii workshop that most of the evidence suggests that circle hooks particularly those which have large minimum widths and are large relative to mouth size of susceptible sea turtles can reduce hooking interactions or mortality or both Use of finfish bait rather than squid bait is also a promising mitigation technique
WCPFC14-2017-OP03,9,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 14th Regular Session Manila Philippines 17 December 2017 WCPFC14 Accordingly WWF proposes a revisionreplacement of CMM 200803 in order to 1 ensure requirements for the determination of optimal bycatch mitigation packages ie circle hooks andor other measures such as finfish bait are undertaken for individual fisheries 2 reduce the ambiguity in language and 3 improve the definition of the desired outcomes of the CMM Moreover evidence suggests that the WCPFC and member states have not suitably monitored the CMM for effectiveness with some parts of the CMM distinguished as providing excessive room for creative compliance6 The majority of CCMs either have not fully reported on compliance with CMM 200803 or have not met all the CMM measures Furthermore only a small fraction of member countries have conducted dedicated research on sea turtle mitigation techniques and current observer coverage falls well below the recommended level for effectively determining optimal mitigation approaches ie 10 coverage over 3 years WWF thus urges WCPFC to support the revisionreplacement of CMM 20083 to include stronger and clearer requirements for adoption of mitigation measures and their specifications We also note the lack of inclusion in the scientific data standards of any data related to sea turtle encounters despite the scope of CMM 20157 includes reportingwith respect to implementation of measures for nontarget species and given the major gaps in annual reporting against CMM 20083 We suggest that such information should be specifically included in assessment criteria and in data standards including where appropriate data on sea turtle encounters including data on hook rates type and other factors comparative to hook type and bait WWF recommends the WCPFC Endorse revising or replacing CMM 200803 as outlined in WWFs Position Statement to the 12th Regular Session of the Commission7 including interim measures that would require members to determine optimum bycatch mitigation via usetesting of alternative hooks andor bait and to report on these results as well as reducing the technical vagueness in desired outcomes of the CMM Encourage member state involvement and participation in the research conducted under the analysis of sea turtle mitigation measure effectiveness in tuna longline fisheries described previously in EBWP05 and further proposed in the Workshop on Joint Analysis of Sea Turtle Mitigation Effectiveness and Support the inclusion of sea turtle data in monitoring scheme assessment criteria and related data standards Regional Observer Programme Information collected as part of an appropriate observer programme is critically important to the proper management of a fishery Data collected by observers plays a central role in informing fisheries scientists on everything ranging from stock assessments to nontarget species impacts Furthermore observers play an indispensable role in monitoring and enforcing very important CMMs in the WCPO Indeed observers represent the vanguard of fisheries management through the science and service that they provide Consequently observer safety and security as well as appropriate observer coverage must be considered a top priority and greater support must be provided to the relevant authority to see that the capacity of the WCPFC Regional Observer Programme ROP is strengthened Observer Safety and Security WWF commends the WCPFCs swift and decisive action to address issues with observer safety and security through the adoption of the observer safety and security provisions during WCPFC12 and the

WCPFC14-2017-OP03,11,WWF Position flag and coastal state requirements at WCPFC13 However WWF continues to strongly believe that more needs to be done to fully address observer safety and security This need is underscored by two recent events Since WCPFC13 two observers have gone overboard at sea One observer James Numbaru will never come home Another observer was recovered after a search and rescue effort These incidents reinforce the need for further efforts to ensure observer safety and security through the full and transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents One of the outstanding gaps in observer safety and security is represented by the lack of information available to address observer incidents through proper followup and documentation A requirement for full reporting will allow for identification and understanding of potentially dangerous situations for future observers Until the WCPFC can fully understand the circumstances surrounding these incidents it cannot hope to properly address them The ROP Annual Report as it currently exists does not provide the necessary level of detail to properly address these issues Thus WWF recommends establishing a required comprehensive and transparent reporting procedure for observers and observer programmes to report instances of threats harrassment intimidation assault or death that national programmes and the ROP could then use to determine solutions to prevent future instances This procedure must include an annual publicly available consolidated detailed and fully transparent report of all infractions against observers Observer Coverage on Longline Vessels WWF notes that observer coverage on longline vessels operating in the WCPO regardless of the metrics used to calculate it remains substantially less than 5 regionwide Moreover WWF wishes to emphasise that the 5 observer coverage value identified by the WCPFC represents an arbitrary benchmark that was never intended to represent an end goal but rather a minimum starting point toward appropriate observer coverage Even a consistently applied level of 5 coverage is statistically and practically useless for most management or monitoring control and surveillance MCS purposes Therefore WWF supports efforts to improve the observer coverage of all longline fisheries in the WCPO As such WWF supports calculating observer coverage according to the proposed hierarchy of four metrics for assessing observer coverage but notes that best practice would be to use number of hooks deployed as an appropriate metric If other metrics for calculating coverage are used terms must be very clearly defined in advance and each metric must be calculated in a way to be comparable to the other metrics WWF also notes that different levels of observer coverage may be required for management or compliance purposes depending on specific identified objectives and recommends that appropriate analyses be conducted to determine each of those levels respectively in the context of identified objectives Most importantly the WCPFC must ensure that the ROP and national observer programmes receive full funding and support to ensure their continued operation and that the level of observer coverage on longline vessels be increased immediately to achieve management and compliance objectives Transhipment Monitoring Transhipment remains one of the most prominent weaknesses in catch documentation and verification that leads to Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU catch in the WCPO WWF notes that the most simple efficient and effective solution to the challenges of transhipmentrelated IUU is to simply prohibit all atsea transhipment and require all fishing vessels to land their catch at the nearest available designated port in the WCPO following the conclusion of fishing activity However acknowledging that a prohibition on transhipment is politically unlikely at this point WWF supports an unequivocal 100 observer monitoring requirement for all transhipments in all WCPFC CA waters subject to strong sanctions for nonreporting and noncompliance WWF also recommends that transhipment requirements be buttressed by verification and validation of transhipment activities through redundant systems including a vessel monitoring system VMS supplemented by an operating automated identification system AIS If through investigation of
WCPFC14-2017-OP03,12,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 14th Regular Session Manila Philippines 17 December 2017 WCPFC14 suspected unreported transhipment activity indicated by VMS and corroborated by AIS it is determined that transhipment activity was conducted in violation of transhipment rules the offending vessels should be subject to sanctions including license revocation and listing on the IUU vessel blacklist WWF recommends the WCPFC Endorse further observer safety and security measures including fully transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents and persons involved Endorse an analysis of levels of observer coverage required to achieve management or compliance purposes while ensuring that the metrics and methodologies used support development of appropriate comparative analyses that meet the needs of the Scientific Services Provider and any MCS objectives and Endorse the use of VMS and AIS to verify and validate 100 observer coverage on all transhipments as well as supporting strong penalties and sanctions for violations Pacific Bluefin Tuna Technical reports of all scientific and management bodies responsible for management of the Pacific bluefin tuna stock including the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike Species in the North Pacific Ocean ISC and the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC indicate that the Pacific Bluefin tuna stock remains in extremely poor condition The ISC confirmed that overfishing continues even though the stock is heavily overfished and its spawning stock biomass has declined to as low as 26 of its unfished level 8 This is a clear indicator that the stock is no longer in the status to support industrial fisheries and the management measures taken both in the Western and Central Pacific and in the Eastern Pacific have proven insufficient to conserve the biological integrity of this stock in timely manner The IATTC and WCPFC must take immediate actions and assume their share of responsibility The latest assessment conducted by ISC confirms that the stock is highly depleted and that fishing mortality exceeds all reasonable proxies for Fmsy Without the robust and precautionary longterm rebuilding target the recovery of the stock may be further delayed if the current scenario of low recruitment continues which is heavily reliant on a major adult cohort in the population Therefore WWF urges both IATTC and WCPFC to adopt a longterm Pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan targeting at least 20SSB0 and harvest control rules that are welldefined preagreed and contain mandatory actions for a determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points In September both the Joint Meeting between Northern Committee NC of the WCPFC and IATTC as well as 13th Annual Meeting of the Northern Committee NC13 agreed a rebuilding target to achieve at least 20SSB0 by no later than 2034 with at least 60 probability including a tentative harvest strategy with associated harvest controls rules WWF recognises this agreement as an important turning point for rebuilding the Pacific bluefin tuna stock While the long term rebuilding target was agreed WWF remains concerned about increasing the catch limit before achieving the initial rebuiding target which was adopted at WCPFC12 WWF urges the WCPFC to consider that such harvest controls rules be based both on the best available scientific evidence and on the precautionary principle Furthermore reports indicate that the member states that catch Pacific bluefin tuna exceeded their catch limits in both 2016 and 2017 WWF strongly recommends the WCPFC strengthen its

WCPFC14-2017-OP04,1,COMMISSION FOURTEENTH REGULAR SESSION Manila Philippines 7 December 2017 A BRIEF TO WCPFC14 WCPFC142017OP04 November 2017
WCPFC14-2017-OP04,2,Submission by The Pew Charitable Trusts
WCPFC14-2017-OP04,3,A brief from Nov 2017 Recommendations to the 14th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission7 December 2017 Manila Philippines Overview The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC has a mandate to sustainably manage and ensure longterm conservation of all highly migratory fish stocks including tunas and sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean However the Commissions handling of some stocks falls short of that mandate and global expectations of best practices despite a Convention that incorporates relatively modern principles of fisheries management The Conservation and Management Measures CMMs in place are inadequate to ensure that overfishing is ended or prevented Management of many stocks is reactive rather than proactive While some progress has been made on the conservation and management of sharks much more is needed to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of sharks is sustainable Masa UshiodaBlue Planet Archive Ensuring sustainable fisheries in the WCPFC Convention Area requires strong conservation and management actions strict compliance with measures already adopted and mechanisms that promote transparency and accountability The Pew Charitable Trusts urges all Commission members cooperating nonmembers and participating territoriesknown collectively as CCMsto cooperate and compromise in order to Agree on and adopt bridging measures for tropical tunas and south Pacific albacore that sustainably manage these tunas while transitioning to management by harvest strategies Adopt the rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin recommended by the Northern Committee and ensure compliance with measures Improve management of fish aggregating devices FADs Adopt electronic reporting and electronic monitoring standards for fishing vessels Prohibit retention of thresher sharks Prohibit retention of manta and mobula rays and adopt live release guidance for both Continue work to develop a comprehensive shark CMM Ban transshipment at sea until authorities can be certain that it does not contribute to illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing activity Improve the effectiveness and transparency of the compliance monitoring scheme Agree on and adopt a port State measures CMM to regulate minimum standards for port inspection of vessels believed to have engaged in IUU fishing or related activities in support of such fishing Urge eligible CCMs to implement the Flick the Switch measure adopted in 2012 which allows their national waters to be monitored by the Commissions Vessel Monitoring System VMS Amend Recommendation 201310 to require that all eligible fishing vessels obtain International Maritime Organization IMO numbers Establish a procedure that permits vessels found to be engaged in IUU fishing to be added to the IUU vessel list between annual meetings Recommendations Modernize management of tunas Fisheries management in the western and central Pacific must consider the importance of the stocks to the regions economies and the wellbeing of marine ecosystems by moving toward modern practices and developing more effective controls on purse seine and longline gears Tuna catches in these waters totaled an estimated 7 million metric tons in 2016the secondhighest amount on recordand represented 56 percent of the global catch1 Healthy stocks such as skipjackwhich accounted for 67 percent of the regions catchshould be managed with a longterm view Other stocks such as Pacific bluefin which is severely depleted and Pacific bigeye a stock of longstanding concern require urgent action that goes beyond business as usual Adopt bridging measures that sustainably manage the tropical tunas and south Pacific albacore while transitioning to the harvest strategy approach The Commission must move toward developing harvest strategies by agreeing on bridging measures for tropical tunas and south Pacific albacore The measures are supposed to serve as a bridge to implementation of harvest strategies as opposed to the ad hoc multiannual decisionmaking of years past that occurred largely in response to changes in stock status The 2017 stock assessment of bigeye which incorporated new growth data provides a more optimistic view of the stock than before It concludes that the stock is likely not experiencing overfishing and is at 032SBF0 with a 16 percent chance of being below the limit reference point The Commission should follow the advice of the Scientific Committee and not increase fishing mortality from current levels to maintain or increase the spawning biomass until members can agree on an appropriate target reference point for bigeye Wellcrafted harvest strategies offer considerable advantages to governments industry and the stocks They include clear objectives and harvest control rules HCRs that are tested for their performance in computer simulations Effective harvest strategies can ensure the sustainability and longterm profitability of resources vital to the wellbeing of the economies fishing industries and people of many nations They can offset natural variability scientific uncertainty and political influence while also allowing managers to act swiftly and efficiently without timeconsuming and costly negotiations To move toward this outcome the bridging measure for tropical tunas at a minimum must Incorporate decisions already made on harvest strategies including Limit reference points shall be 20 percent of the estimated average spawning biomass in the absence of fishing When developing HCRs in the future the Commission will determine the acceptability of HCRs in which the estimated risk of breaching limit reference points is between 0 and 20 percent Manage the skipjack purse seine fishery to achieve the interim target reference point of 50 percent of the estimated average spawning biomass of skipjack in the absence of fishing Manage bigeye to avoid increases in fishing mortality and increase the current spawning biomasswhich would decrease the probability that the stock is below the limit reference pointby Setting sciencebased longline catch limits that encompass all areas of the Convention Area where significant fishing is occurring Setting sciencebased FAD set limits in the purse seine fishery Link decisions on harvest strategies to the WCPFC harvest strategy workplan and prioritize agreement on a target reference point for bigeye given the concern for the stock and ensure timely development of a target reference point for yellowfin Support additional harvest strategy elements in the Commission workplan The Commission must build on last years progress to support efforts beyond the context of the bridging measures that are essential building blocks in developing harvest strategies for tunas Reflecting the importance of these stocks the Commission should adhere to the timelines in the workplan to Agree on a list of performance indicators even if only on an interim basis to model bigeye and yellowfin harvest control rules in the management strategy evaluation MSE Agree on actions necessary to conduct MSE as scheduled for skipjack to support MSE for all other tuna stocks with appropriate budgets and to ensure stakeholder outreach and capacity building to develop greater comfort with the harvest strategy approach Adopt a precautionary target reference point for south Pacific albacore Adopt the recommended rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin and ensure compliance with measures After years of stalemate the Northern Committee reached agreement on a recommended rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin at its meeting in August The plan aims to rebuild the population to at least 20 percent of its unfished levels by 2034 and includes commitments to develop reference points and harvest controls and to test them using MSE It also puts restrictions on how and when catch limits can be raised in the future ensuring that if the species is slow to recover management measures will be responsive to the state of the population This is a first step toward implementing a full harvest strategy for the severely depleted Pacific bluefin population which is at just 26 percent of its historic size but it is only the beginning of the needed efforts In the past two years both Japan and Korea have exceeded their catch limits for Pacific bluefin If the recovery plan is to reach its goals and return the species to healthy levels all members must commit to reducing future quotas to pay back these overages and to take all domestic actions needed to avoid exceeding these limits in the future In light of the outcomes of the Northern Committee meeting Pew recommends that the WCPFC Adopt the recommended rebuilding plan and CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna Note the recent catch limit overages and strongly urge all CCMs to implement the necessary domestic measures to prevent such overages in the future Direct all CCMs to comply with the reporting requirements in CMM 201604 Commit to continuing to include Pacific bluefin on the WCPFC annual meeting agenda so the Commission can monitor the Northern Committees progress in meeting rebuilding plan deadlines Effectively manage fish aggregating devices Bigeye tuna in the purse seine fishery are taken almost exclusively in sets on FADs while the use of FADs contributes to the catch of nontarget species such as some species of sharks and turtles as well as marine debris Improving FAD management should be an urgent priority The Commission neither limits the total allowable number of sets that can be made on FADs nor the number of FADs that can be deployed It also lacks basic data on how many FADs are deployed or their fates lost abandoned etc Given the significance of the FAD fishery the Commission should lead in FAD management It took a step forward when it created the FAD Working Group which held two meetings in 2016 but the group did not recommend FAD management options a key part of its terms of reference and did not meet in 2017 An independent Global FAD Science Symposium held in Santa Monica California in 2017 included experts familiar with the western and central Pacific Ocean They agreed on a series of best practices for managing FADs in a tropical tuna purse seine fishery2 The WCPFC Scientific Committee recommended that the Commission take into consideration the examples of best practices when developing a framework for management of FADs within the Convention Area Given the significance of FAD use the Commission should follow the scientific advice and take steps to improve the data collection and management of FADs including Agree to introduce a FAD buoy identification scheme as recommended by the Scientific Committee and the Technical and Compliance Committee and agree to develop a physical marking scheme for the raft components of FADs recognizing that FAD buoys are frequently swapped among rafts Adopt the changes recommended by the Scientific Committee to the data fields to be filled out by observers and vessel operators to ensure that data is collected from all vessels involved in FAD activities including support vessels That will allow the Commission to better understand the number of FADs deployed their fates and construction methods Agree to establish a clear process to improve FAD management noting the best practices agreed to during the independent FAD Science Symposium related to Agreeing to management objectives for FAD use Shifting some fishing effort to free school fishing through market such as certification schemes policy such as FAD set limits or other incentives which would have a positive impact for juvenile tunas and certain nontarget species Establishing a cap on the number of FADs to avoid cherrypicking and reduce marine pollution including beaching or grounding of FADs Using nonentangling FADs which result in little to no risk of entangling sharks and turtles without decreasing catches of tunas Adopt electronic reporting and electronic monitoring standards Commission policies currently do not require sufficient and timely submission of critical fishing data or mandate that their accuracy is confirmed which contributes to ineffective management of the tuna longline fisheries in the Convention Area In 2014 fish caught by longliners in the western and central Pacific had an end value of almost US4 billion3 Given the economic importance of that sector of the fishery the Commission should act to safeguard its longterm sustainability by instituting regulations to address data gaps so that timely and accurate tracking of longline fishing catch and effort can be ensured Promising new technologies can make required reporting and monitoring faster more accurate and more reliable Electronic reporting ER systems allow information on catches to be relayed in near realtime in a standardized format In addition proven electronic monitoring EM technology can be used to expand observer coverage requirementswithout additional onboard personnel Technological advances coupled with the increasing costeffectiveness of ER and EM systems can help improve fisheries management and ensure high levels of compliance with conservation and management measures Near realtime electronic catch reporting improves accountability and accuracy which benefits authorities vessel owners and scientists Many WCPFC member countries have already embraced these technologies as effective management tools for their domestic fisheries Pew calls on members of the WCPFC to Adopt the pending electronic observer reporting and transshipment declaration and notification standards and direct the ER and EM Working Group to oversee development of necessary EM standards Require 100 percent electronic reporting to improve timeliness and accuracy of catch reporting Require CMMs to report the level of observer coverage achieved for their carrier vessels as mandated by CMM 200906 Commit to requiring 100 percent observer coverage on longline vessels as now required on purse seine vessels by complementing onboard human observers with electronic monitoring once standards have been adopted Strengthen conservation and management of sharks An unsustainable number of sharksan estimated 63 million to 273 millionare caught and killed in commercial fisheries each year4 Whether this catch is highly sought after or unintended and unwanted managers must take immediate action to stop the decline in shark populations and mitigate the damage it causes to marine ecosystems Until measures are in place to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of sharks is sustainable harvest of these animals should be avoided Those caught should be released alive whenever possible Fishing gear that increases the likelihood of shark catch such as wire leaders and shark lines should be prohibited and research should be done to determine the best means of avoiding shark catch If CCMs are to continue to target sharks or to catch sharks as bycatch then the Commission must enact management measures that reflect the precautionary principle In instances where limited population data for shark species results in uncertain stock assessments managers must implement precautionary measures such as prohibitions or catch limits that can safeguard these vulnerable stocks The Commission should also require that fins be naturally attached when sharks are landed Adopting this global standard would allow for better enforcement of the WCPFC prohibition on shark finning Based on the advice of the WCPFC Scientific Committee Pew calls on the Commission to Prohibit the retention of thresher sharks Thresher sharks are among the most vulnerable of all shark families5 but have been subject to no management action in WCPFC fisheries A Pacificwide assessment presented at this years Scientific Committee meeting shows that fishing mortality is likely to be above sustainable levels particularly for bigeye threshers All three species of thresher shark were listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES in October 2016 meaning that all international trade or import of catch from international waters must be sustainable as of 4 October 2017 Management action is urgently needed both to implement that listing and to respond to the new WCPFC scientific advice Pew urges the Commission to Ban the retention of all thresher sharks while prioritizing data collection on ongoing bycatch levels and post release survival to inform future management strategies including sustainable catch limits Prohibit retention of manta and mobula rays and adopt live release guidance The family Mobulidae which includes manta rays and mobula rays is extremely vulnerable to overfishing Observer reports show that manta and mobula rays are often killed as bycatch in WCPFC purse seine fisheries 284 metric tons were recorded from 1994 to 20096 At its recent meeting the Scientific Committee adopted safe handling guidelines for these species that will facilitate live release Furthermore the Technical and Compliance Committee TCC recommended that the Commission adopt these safe release guidelines for manta rays and mobulids Pew urges the Commission to Ban the retention of manta and mobula rays and implement the Scientific Committees 2017 guidelines for safe release of such rays when caught incidentally in WCPFC fisheries Continue work to develop a comprehensive shark CMM At its 2016 meeting the Commission initiated work to develop an overarching shark CMM to help the WCPFC better manage both targeted shark fisheries and incidental bycatch This year the Scientific Council started work on development of this measure although additional effort is needed over the next year to refine it Pew applauds this initiative and encourages the WCPFC to continue efforts to develop a comprehensive shark CMM that would prioritize the following Banning wire leaders and shark lines in fisheries that are not declared as targeted shark fisheries to reduce the mortality of prohibited species Ensuring that all targeted shark fisheries are subject to management plans that limit mortality to sustainable levelsespecially for heavily exploited blue and mako sharks Expanding observer coverage for longline fleets operating in the Convention Area Adopting a no data no fish measure for sharks which would prohibit CCMs that do not submit landing data on key shark species from retaining shark catches Continue efforts to stop illegal fishing Ban transshipment at sea until authorities can be certain it does not contribute to IUU activity A lack of effective regulations and monitoring means that illegal unreported and misreported transshipment of catch at sea particularly within the longline sector contributes significantly to IUU activity in the Commission area Within the western and central Pacific alone an estimated 142 million a year of tuna and tunalike product is involved in illegal atsea transshipment activities7 The current WCPFC transshipment measure CMM 200906 includes several exemptions and loopholes that increase opportunities for IUU transshipment For example activities in archipelagic waters are exempted from reporting requirements meaning that transshipments that occur in hundreds of thousands of square kilometres within the Convention Area go unreported In addition activities in a countrys exclusive economic zone are governed by national legislation which can be weaker than WCFPC reporting requirements Finally despite the intention of CMM 200906 to strictly limit transshipment at sea more than 52 percent of nonpurse seine vessels currently on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels were allowed to transship on the high seas in 2016 up from 49 percent the previous year At the same time the WCPFC Convention says Commission members must encourage their fishing vessels to conduct transshipment in port to support efforts to ensure accurate reporting of catches8 However over the past six years both the number of transshipping events at sea and the number of fishing vessels involved in transshipping at sea have increased making these activities the norm rather than the exception In addition verification of reported transshipment activity remains difficult Although all carrier vessels are required to have 100 percent observer coverage the WCPFC Secretariat does not currently receive reports from these observers nor does it maintain a database for this information That means that observer reports of transshipments on the high seas cannot be compared or crossverified with information provided directly from the vessel The Secretariat also cannot audit these activities because vessels are not required to provide transshipping notifications and declarations to the Secretariat when transshipping occurs in port within EEZs or in archipelagic waters As such no single body including the Secretariat maintains a full and complete picture of this activity within the entire Convention Area from the point of catch to the point of offloading Additional controls are needed to ensure that transshipment activities are legal and verifiable Pew calls on members of the WCPFC to Ban transshipment at sea until authorities can be certain it does not contribute to IUU activity Direct the TCC to review the draft guidelines prepared by the Secretariat for determination of circumstances when it is impracticable for certain vessels to transship in port or in waters under national jurisdiction as required in CMM 200906 Establish formal observer reporting processes procedures submission requirements and standardized forms for observers on carrier vessels to ensure that every highseas transshipment reported via declarations can be cross validated by the Secretariat as to species quantity and location Improve transshipment reporting protocols to create a full and complete picture of this activity as it occurs regardless of location by requiring transshipment reports and declarations to be provided to the Secretariat wherever and whenever the activity takes place in the Convention Area Improve the effectiveness and transparency of the compliance monitoring scheme The Second Joint Meeting of Tuna RFMOs in 2009 recommended that the regional fisheries management organizations develop robust compliance review mechanisms so that the records of each member of the Commission could be examined on an annual basis As a result the WCPFC established a trial Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS to ensure that CCMs meet their obligations The CMS is designed to assess CCM compliance It also helps to identify areas where technical assistance or capacity building may be needed and determine aspects of CMMs that require refinement or amendment for effective implementation That CMS measure however continues to operate on a shortterm trial basis CCMs must make significant investments of time to assess CMM compliance each year and review and renew the measure itself Because the CMS is a critical component of the WCPFC compliance process CCMs should make it permanent and remove the need for an annual review In addition the CMS does not include tangible penalties for non compliance with Commission obligations and has been implemented in a manner that prohibits observers from being present for CMS reviews and discussions In advance of the report of an independent CMS audit to be released in 2018 the Commission should agree to the following principles to improve the CMS in ways that fully and transparently support its conservation and management objectives The CMS should be a permanent measure to ensure greater predictability and certainty That would allow the TCC to devote more time to reviewing issues of compliance rather than the CMS itself Penalties should be set for noncompliance to establish a more effective and efficient scheme with the proper level of deterrence Observers should be permitted in CMS discussions in accordance with the WCPFC Conventions language on transparency and the practices of other tuna RFMOs Such a step would be a recognition that transparency is critical to accountability and a fundamental principle of good practice in public resource management Enhance CCM transparency and accountability Adopt minimum standards for port inspections Port State measures PSMs are costeffective tools to monitor compliance with management arrangements and prevent illegal fish from entering the market PSM proposals have been considered by the Commission for several years and were recommended as part of the WCPFC Performance Review in 2013 Recent efforts to adopt a CMM on Port State Measures to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing have fallen short but circumstances have changed in recent years The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Port States Measures Agreement entered into force in 2016 with a number of WCPFC members now party to the agreement creating a strong basis to establish a regional scheme within the WCPFC Pew urges the Commission to Adopt a port State measures CMM as soon as possible to regulate minimum standards for port inspection of vessels believed to have engaged in IUU fishing or related activities in support of such fishing If there is no agreement at the annual meeting task a small working group to develop text on a port State measures CMM for consideration by the TCC in 2018 with formal adoption by the Commission next year Urge eligible CCMs to implement the WCPFC9 Flick the Switch measure Since its adoption in 2012 the WCPFC9 Flick the Switch measure has received wide support from member countries that belong to the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency FFA9 Implementing the measure meant that CCMs with coastal State waters in the Convention Area could have their own national waters monitored by the Commissions VMS However not all coastal State CCMs have flicked the switch Bringing in the remaining costal State CCMs including the remaining five FFA member countries10 would maximize the usefulness of the Commissions VMS as a tool to eliminate illegal fishing It would give authorities in all coastal State CMM countries the ability to monitor nonlicensed vessels on the WCPFC authorized vessel list if they operated in their national waters This type of effective monitoring would help close a major loophole for IUU fishing Pew urges the Commission to Encourage all coastal state CCMs especially the FFA members to adopt the WCPFC9 measure Flick the Switch to maximize the use of VMS and improve the transparency of fishing operations in the Convention Area Amend Recommendation 201310 to require that all eligible fishing vessels obtain IMO numbers Recommendation 201310 entered into force 1 January 2016 and required that all vessels of 100 gross tons gross registered tons or more obtain an IMO number Member states have made great progress in providing IMO numbers for most active eligible vessels although gaps remain Member states are encouraged to ensure that none of their vessels that are required to have IMO numbers are fishing without this identification IMO numbers should be clearly marked in all vessel records In August 2016 the IMO amended its guidance on eligibility criteria for IMO numbers Fishing vessels of non steel hull construction of 100 GT and above and all motorized inboard fishing vessels of less than 100 GT down to 12 metres in length overall that are authorized to operate outside waters under national jurisdiction are now eligible This means that more than 200011 additional vessels listed on the WCPFC record of vessels can now obtain an IMO number Accordingly the Secretariat is encouraged to amend Recommendation 201310 to include all eligible fishing vessels Pew urges the Commission to Amend Recommendation 201310 to require that all eligible fishing vessels obtain IMO numbers Enhance the effectiveness of the IUU vessel list Placing a vessel on WCPFCs IUU vessel list helps to highlight and ultimately deter unacceptable practices in the Convention Area However the lists effectiveness is diminished because vessels found to be engaged in IUU fishing can be added only once a year As a result these vessels operate unhindered until the Commission meets and CCMs put them on the list The WCPFC permits vessels to be removed from the IUU vessel list between annual meetings In the same spirit the Commission should permit the listing of IUU vessels intersessionally Pew calls on members of the WCPFC to Establish a procedure that permits the addition of vessels found to be engaged in IUU fishing to the IUU vessel list between annual meetings Endnotes Peter Williams et al Overview of Tuna Fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean Including Economic Conditions2016 paper

WCPFC14-2017-OP09,3,Greenpeace priorities at the 14th Regular Session of the Commission Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Greenpeace priorities at the 14th Regular Session Manila Philippines 27 December 2017 Fifty six percent of the world tuna catch is taken in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPO Fisheries under the purview of the WCPFC are of immense social and economic importance and its parties must make sure that agreed conservation and management measures maintain all exploited and associated fish populations at abundant levels While current stock assessments indicate a varying degree of probabilities that the main tuna species exploited by this Commission are not currently overfished or suffering overfishing there are strong reasons to be cautious including important uncertainties in the stock assessments or lack of clarity about whether recent improvements on some stocks have been due to environmental conditions management measures or other factors1 Of concern is that bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks have been declining for about 60 and 50 years respectively2 South Pacific albacore may continue to decline under current conditions the poor status of Pacific bluefin tuna population represents a major failure for this Commission several shark species are threatened and for most shark populations the Commission continues to fail to gather the information needed to ensure their conservation The dominant industrial fishing gears continue to gain space while smallerscale operations continue to decline3 Below we outline a nonexhaustive list of priority measures that Greenpeace believes can bring about progress to management of WCPO tuna fisheries if adopted at this 14th Session They refer to 1 data collection 2 management of fishing capacity including FADs 3 conservation of fish stocks 4 Monitoring Control and Surveilance MCS including transshipments and 5 Harvest control rules and target and limit reference points Data collection Timely collection of comprehensive data across WCPO tuna fisheries underpins the work of the Commission Data must be statistically significant for assessing the range of issues and impacts relevant to these fisheries Independent observers onboard fishing vessels collect vital data for science and compliance but their safety continues to be a concern Progress must be made on electronic monitoring but needs to be tested and seen as a way to increase observer coverage not to meet minimum thresholds This 14
WCPFC14-2017-OP09,4,th Session of the WCPFC must agree on measures that
WCPFC14-2017-OP09,5,strengthen mandatory reporting requirements to ensure that all data needed to manage fishing capacity and effort are effectively collected for all tuna billfish and shark fisheries so as to allow for the best performance of the Scientific Committee and a sound basis for Conservation and Management Measures See paragraph 51 of the Report from the 13th Regular Session of the WCPFC Scientific Committee Available at httpswwwwcpfcintmeetingssc13 See paragraphs 52 and 72 of the Report from the 13th Regular Session of the WCPFC Scientific Committee The 2016 pole and line catch 199457 mt was the lowest annual catch since the late1960s The 2016 South Pacific troll albacore catch 2097 mt was the lowest catch since 2009 See paragraphs 13 and 22 of the Report from the 13th Regular Session of the WCPFC Scientific Committee Page 1 of 4 Greenpeace priorities at the 14th Regular Session of the Commission require a clearlydefined representative 20 observer coverage on longline fleets Where human onboard observers are not feasible for certain fleets or vessel sizes other alternatives such as electronic monitoring systems must be assessed and put in place subject to minimum technical requirements that ensure the reliability of the system ensure the health and safety of all observers4 by developing robust safety and security measures and transparent reporting mechanisms for infractions and actions taken against any operators or crew members that harassment intimidation harm or in any way prevent observers from performing their duties ensure that failure to comply with data provision obligations has deterrent consequences in the form of sanctions penalties or loss of access to fisheries Management of fishing capacity including FADs The everincreasing level of fishing capacity and effort in the region5 represents a fundamental failure to meet the obligation under the Convention to take measures to prevent or eliminate overfishing and excess fishing capacity Recent analysis on the purse seine sector demonstrates that overcapacity is substantial6 dFAD numbers and improved dFADs technology play a key role in that regard Despite years of increased proliferation it is very concerning that basic numbers about FADs use remain unknown This 14
WCPFC14-2017-OP09,6,th Session of the WCPFC must agree on measures that
WCPFC14-2017-OP09,7,make it mandatory for any vessel using dFADs to provide access to the raw data from the dFAD buoys by the WCPFC Scientific Committee including historical information subject to adequate confidentiality requirements but ensuring transparency and sharing of information at the appropriate level prohibit the use of supply and tender vessels taking into account their role in increasing dFAD efficiency and that dFAD effort in the fishery is already too high address the impacts of dFADs by agreeing together with the FAD ban season adopted through the bridging tropical tuna measures on a significant and precautionary reduction in the number of dFADs buoys and sets allowed These FAD management options should be such that they ensure with high probability that bigeye tuna mortality does not increase from current levels make the use of biodegradable and nonentangling FAD designs mandatory with clear definitions based on data available to the scientific committee ensure an assessment of the capacity of longline fisheries is conducted within the shortest time possible including assessing the role of transshipments in increasing effective capacity and effort and adopt measures to eliminate overcapacity where it exists Conservation of target and nontarget fish stocks While current stock assessments indicate a varying degree of probabilities that the main tuna and billfish species exploited by this Commission are not currently overfished or suffering overfishing there are strong reasons to be cautious including important uncertainties in the stock In 2016 there were 20 reports of intimidation harassment or interference of observers See paragraph of the Report of the 13th Regular Session of the WCPFC Technical and Compliance Committee The majority of candidate effort creep indicators have increased over the recent period when examined both within and outside PNA EEZs The number of sets made per day has gradually increased over time reflecting an increase in effective effort within fishing day limits See Pilling G Tidd A the PNA Office Norris W Hampton J 2016 Updating indicators of effort creep in the WCPO purse seine fishery WCPFCSC132017MIWP04 Tidd A Pilling G 2016 Preliminary capacity utilization of the WCPO purse seine fleet using Data Envelopment Analysis WCPFCSC122016MIIP03 Page 2 of 4 Greenpeace priorities at the 14th Regular Session of the Commission assessments The aspirations of the Commission must go beyond not increasing fishing mortality from current levels to rebuilding populations to abundant levels Urgent action is required on fisheries targeting the highly depleted Pacific bluefin tuna and North Pacific striped marlin as well as to ensure the recovery of shark populations While north Pacific blue sharks appear to have recovered from a period of overfishing oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks populations have been devastated by both longliners and purse seiners We do not have enough data to adequately assess other shark species but a new approach for assessing fishery impacts on data poor shark species has highlighted that current fishing pressure on bigeye thresher is unsustainable7 Despite these issues WCPFC parties continue to resist developing even the most basic Shark Management Plans This 14
WCPFC14-2017-OP09,8,th Session of the WCPFC must agree on
WCPFC14-2017-OP09,9,measures that result in a precautionary decrease of fishing mortality on bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks particularly juveniles adopt the rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin recommended by the Northern Committee NC as a minimum action and call on the NC to continue to review it and increase its ambition Given the status of the stock it should be a priority that any catches in excess of the quotas be paid back by those States responsible continue work to develop a comprehensive shark CMM so as to ensure that all targeted shark fisheries are subject to management plans that limit mortality to sustainable levels including measures to improve the quality and quantity of data recorded and reported for all sharks caught details of the gear types used and the condition of each animal on release dead injured alive and a requirement that all sharks are landed with their fins naturally attached prohibit retention of thresher sharks and manta and mobula rays banning both wire leaders and shark lines in fisheries that are not declared as targeted shark fisheries to reduce the mortality of prohibited species ensure that any failure to provide data on sharks results in a prohibition to retain shark catches Monitoring control and surveillance including transshipments The current measure requiring a 5 observer level for longline fleets has been in force for a decade so it is about time that the failure by many fleets to meet this threshold results in consequences There should be strict deterrent consequences for the lack of compliance by Members and Cooperating NonMembers and their vessels to ensure management objectives are met Transshipments at sea continue to provide an easy access point for illegal fishing vessels to unload their illegal catches into the supply chain away from coast guards and port authorities This can make it impossible to track a shipment of fish back to the vessel that caught it and to detect fraud In the worst situations transshipment enables slavery at sea as crews can be kept at sea for months or even years at a time without getting back to a port making it difficult if not impossible to report on or to escape from physical abuse poor working conditions violence and even murder on board fishing vessels Finally NGOs have consistently pointed out to the lack of transparency in the work of the WCPFC Technical and Compliance Committee which is counterproductive to the objectives of the Commission and fails to acknowledge the contribution that civil society has made on this matter over the years This 14
WCPFC14-2017-OP09,10,th Session of the WCPFC must agree on measures that
WCPFC14-2017-OP09,11,See paragraphs 388413 of the Report from the 13th Regular Session of the WCPFC Scientific Committee Page 3 of 4 Greenpeace priorities at the 14th Regular Session of the Commission Phase out all transshipment at sea In the interim all transshipment must have observers on board both the fishing and carrier vessels and provisions on realtime reporting must be put in place Any violation detected in transshipment must result in the loss of transshipment authorization require a clearlydefined representative 20 observer coverage on longline fleets adopt Port State Measures provisions equivalent to those of the 2009 FAO Agreement on Port State Measures Agreement PSMA and invite all WCPFC parties to ratify and implement the FAO PSMA impose penalties for cases of noncompliance to ensure that States comply with all their data reporting requirements such as the No Data No Fishing measures agreed at other tuna commissions improve transparency and facilitate compliance work by removing barriers to NGO and IGO observer access to the compliance monitoring processes and relevant meetings Implementation of applicable international law target and limit reference points Greenpeace would like to recall that the adoption of stock specific target and limit reference points and management strategies is a requirement under international law namely under article 6 of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement which has been in force now for over 15 years This 14
WCPFC14-2017-OP09,12,th Session
WCPFC14-2017-OP09,13,of the WCPFC must agree on measures that ensure that work on establishing further target and limit reference points and harvest strategies for all tuna and shark stocks in the WCPO continues and is well resourced and funded consistent with proposed timelines ensure finalization of a harvest control rule in the skipjack purse seine fishery and the urgent implementation of interim precautionary target reference points for North and South Pacific albacore bigeye and yellowfin tunas For further information please contact Vince Cinches Oceans and political campaigner Greenpeace South East Asia vincecinches

WCPFC14-2017-OP10,4,Recommendations to the 14th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission
WCPFC14-2017-OP10,5,The International Game Fish Association IGFA is a nonprofit organization that represents recreational anglers throughout the world IGFA was established in 1939 has active members in over 100 countries and provides rules for ethical angling practices Many of IGFAs members target the highly migratory species managed by WCPFC especially marlin sailfish and spearfish ie billfish which are primarily caught and released
WCPFC14-2017-OP10,6,IGFA has great concern about how highly migratory species are being managed on a global level for recreational anglers The lack of data and accurate reporting on billfish catch is of particular concern As an organization that is committed to the conservation of game fishes IGFA has deployed over 300 popup satellite archival tags in marlin around the world in the past six years many of which have been in waters under this organizations purview The information gained from this exercise is available to your scientific committee
WCPFC14-2017-OP10,7,Billfish Although primarily a commercial bycatch species billfish are highly sought after recreational species that are primarily caught and released We urge the WCPFC to set a target reference rate above BMSY for recreational anglers The WCNPO stock of striped marlin is overfished and experiencing overfishing Spawning stock biomass is estimated to be only 39 of SSBMSY Reducing fishing mortality would likely increase spawning stock biomass and may improve the chances of higher recruitment As such IGFA recommends fishing at a constant catch of 2500 mt to allow the stock to rebuild No formal stock assessments exist for sailfish and black marlin Better data collection is necessary for these species so that their true abundance can be accurately estimated IGFA further recommends implementing a prohibition on Pacific billfish entering into international trade Similar legislation has recently been passed at the request of IGFA in the United States that now bans importation of marlin sailfish and spearfish into the continental United States We also recommend all countries be required to report dead discards and use circle hooks in their longline fisheries
WCPFC14-2017-OP10,8,Bluefin Tuna The 2016 stock assessment indicates that Pacific Bluefin tuna have been reduced to less than 3 of their virgin biomass Last August the Northern Committee developed a rebuilding plan with a goal of restoring the population to at least 20 of virgin biomass by 2034 and also committed to developing reference points and harvest control rules The IGFA commends this first step towards implementing a full harvest strategy and recommends that the WCPFC Adopt the recommended rebuilding plan and conservation and management measures for Pacific bluefin tuna Note that both Japan and Korea have exceeded their catch limits over the last two years and urge these countries to implemement domestic measures to prevent future overages Include Pacific bluefin tuna on the WCPFCs annual meeting agenda to monitor rebuilding plan progress
WCPFC14-2017-OP10,9,The International Game Fish Association is a notforprofit organization committed to the conservation of game fish and the promotion of responsible ethical angling practices through science education rule making record keeping and recognition of outstanding accomplishments in the field of angling Email HQigfaorg Website wwwigfaorg

WCPFC14-2017-OP10,11,FADs The increasing use of FADs in tuna purse seine fisheries has become a global issue IGFA urges the Commission to enact measures to reduce the harvest of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna FAD associated purse seine fisheries IGFA further recommends Developing a FAD identification scheme as recommended byt the Scientific Committee and the Technical and Compliance Committee Establish a cap on the number of FADs Enforce the use of nontangling FADs to reduce shark and turtle entanglement IUU Transhipment at sea facilitates IUU fishing and the IGFA recommends that the WCPFC ban all forms of transhipment at sea until it can be demonstrated that such operations are not contributing to IUU fishing
WCPFC14-2017-OP10,12,Recreational Fishing Recreational angling is an established and important economic entity in developed countries and a growing one in many developing nations As such we wish that WCPFC recognize both its relevance and that it may necessitate alternate management objectives than those used in commercial fisheries IGFA kindly offers its consultation to WCPFC on recreational fisheries issues

the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Manila Philippines 27 December 2017 The International Pole Line Foundation IPNLF is an international charity working to develop and demonstrate the value of onebyone tuna fisheries Its role is twofold to promote the benefits of onebyone tuna fisheries and to develop these fisheries to support and improve their viability and sustainability We work across science policy and the seafood sector to improve the wellbeing of coastal communities who are committed to environmentally and socially responsible tuna fishing methods such as pole andline troll and handline The Western and Central Pacific has strong historical linkages to such fisheries and many continue to play important roles in Indonesia Japan New Zealand the Solomon Islands Tahiti the Philippines among others An important part of our work involves connecting people and organisations that want to support the sustainable development of onebyone fisheries Our membership which currently stands at 50 includes a broad range of fishery associations and businesses involved in the onebyone tuna supply chain Our member onebyone tuna fisheries active in the WCPFC Convention Area include fishers from Indonesia New Zealand and the United States In Indonesia IPNLF together with our partner Asosiasi Periknan Pole Line Dan Handline Indonesia AP2HI and the Government of Indonesia work to improve several aspects of the onebyone fisheries Drawing on our network of international experts and working with AP2HIs 27 member companies and their fishers our goal is to improve the

years Commission meeting IPNLF encourages members cooperating nonmembers and participating territories CCMs collectively to adopt a number of conservation and management measures CMMs that together will strengthen the framework for sustainable tuna fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean Specifically we urge progress in the following areas Continue progress on the adoption of harvest strategies for all major stocks in line with the proposed timeline that aim to avoid adverse impacts on the stocks while also recognizing the social and economic dependence of coastal communities that rely on the fisheries Adopt an enforceable and effective bridging measure for the management of tropical tunas that recognizes the important social and economic contributions of onebyone tuna fisheries to coastal communities throughout the Convention Area Improve the monitoring and regulation of purse seine supply vessels and other undermanaged fishing gears that contribute to overall fishing effort including the impacts associated with drifting fish aggregating devices dFADs Reduce marine pollution including of plastics and drifting FADs which damage coastal habitats by adhering to marine debris reporting requirements recovering dFADs at sea and requiring fully biodegradable materials in dFAD construction Adopt measures that will effectively reduce bycatch and protect endangered threatened or protected species including sharks seabirds cetaceans and turtles Improve observer safety and increase longline observer coverage including via electronic monitoring to better estimate bycatch and improve monitoring of the fishery Increase the transparency of the WCPFC compliance process by allowing accredited observers to participate in the process International Pole Line Foundation London Street Reading RG1 4QW United states Registered charity no 1145586 infoipnlforg wwwipnlforg The proposals on tropical tunas and south Pacific albacore tuna are particularly important this year in the face of increasing fishing effort and stock status projections Progress in these areas is needed as more sustainable management frameworks will benefit every CCM bring positive

WCPFC14-2017-OP13,4,World Tuna Purse seine Organization
WCPFC14-2017-OP13,5,WTPO Statement for WCPFC 14 The World Tuna Purse Seine Organization WTPO reiterate its adherence to the further development of the tuna fishery by having better efficient and sustainable solutions in the management of the tuna resources in all oceans
WCPFC14-2017-OP13,6,WTPO continues to follow promote and support a no exemption on fishing capacity control in all areas
WCPFC14-2017-OP13,7,WTPO again requests the WCPFC to continue its review of the current WCPFC definition of Fish Aggregate Device FAD We believe that the current WCPFC FAD definition is not comprehensive thus resulting in confusion and misunderstanding between the observers on board and the fishing vessel operators
WCPFC14-2017-OP13,8,WTPO strongly recommends to adopt the IATTC definition of FishAggregating Device FAD which means anchored drifting floating or submerged objects deployed andor tracked by vessels including through the use of radio andor satellite buoys for the purpose of aggregating target tuna species for purseseine fishing operations httpswwwiattcorgPDFFiles2ResolutionsC1601FADsAmendmentC1503pd
WCPFC14-2017-OP13,9,WTPO also support the current FFAPNA Observer Program and look forward to strengthen their credibility through continuous improvement in the implementation of observer regulations and updating of new knowledge related to the said program including the selection of qualified and competent FFAPNA observers to make acceptable fair and accurate reports while carrying out their tasks In addition the WTPO supports the establishment of a mechanism for observer providers to give feedback in a timely manner
WCPFC14-2017-OP13,10,WTPO also proposes the creation of a WCPFC working group to work with vessel operators with the objective of establishing new and improved systems and mechanisms that addresses all stakeholder concerns
WCPFC14-2017-OP13,11,WTPO wishes to pursue the issues of transparency of the Vessel Day Scheme VDS such as standard definition and interpretation claims rejection and calling for a more firm commitment from the PNA to provide timely solutions to the Non Fishing Days NFD claims
WCPFC14-2017-OP13,12,WTPO recognizes that the IFIMS system is considered as an efficient tool to be used by all stakeholders including all PNA members to effectively manage the Vessel Day Scheme VDS as the regional standard
WCPFC14-2017-OP13,13,Lastly the WTPO is committed to the conservation and sustainable use of tuna resources and encourages WCPFC 14 to adopt scientifically based management measures successfully implemented in other RFMOs

WCPFC14-2017-OP14,7,This letter is submitted and supported by Greenpeace on behalf of Indonesian and Philippine canneries and Thailand brands
WCPFC14-2017-OP14,8,South East Asia Cannery Intervention to WCPFC141 Tuna is the most economically valuable fish in the world as well as an important predator species in marine ecosystems The tuna industry provides thousands of jobs in the catching processing and trading sector worldwide Globally commercial tuna is worth about USD 42 billion per year2 The Western and Central Pacific Ocean is the worlds largest tuna fishery yielding of the worlds total catch in 2016 The Western Central Pacific Ocean is a very important resource for canneries in Southeast Asia as it produced 2717850 MT valued at 53 billion in 20163 Processors in Thailand Philippines and Indonesia are key in efforts to achieve sustainability traceability and equity In July 2017 Greenpeace and Thai Union has reached an agreement4 on four issues of concern human rights transshipment longline and FADs Under this agreement Thai Union has made significant and far reaching commitments that aim to support current best practices in fisheries reduce illegal and unethical practices from global supply chains and bring more responsibly caught tuna to key markets This package of reforms position the company well to help build the necessary momentum towards a more sustainable socially responsible and transparent industry By the end of 2018 an independent thirdparty will review progress todate on the commitments made in the agreement Greenpeace supports the initiatives detailed in the agreement and will closely follow its progress and implementation Processors in Southeast Asia shall be contributing towards the example set by Thai Union We shall implement reforms to address human rights transshipment longline and FADs with clear milestones by 2020 We shall continue to undertake open and transparent dialogue with key stakeholders5

WCPFC14-2017-OP14,10,Recommendations
WCPFC14-2017-OP14,11,Human Rights We are deeply concerned about issues of human rights abuses on board distant water fishing vessels which employ citizens in the region We believe that the WCPFC is an important platform to address human rights As such the WCPFC should consider issuing an official policy statement on human rights and make appropriate steps to prevent such abuses
WCPFC14-2017-OP14,12,Longliners We strongly support proposals on better monitoring control and surveillance of longliners7 These measures should consider
WCPFC14-2017-OP14,13,a A ban on transshipment on the high seas b Observer coverage representational across all fleets and regions and a roadmap to implement 100 fully tested electronic and human observer monitoring c Fully automated VMS on every vessel no manual reporting allowed
WCPFC14-2017-OP14,14,Fish Aggregating Devices We strongly support proposals which limits the numbers of FAD sets and the number of FADs released with corresponding strong measures for reporting and transparency in FAD use Such measures should have
WCPFC14-2017-OP14,15,a An interim limit on FAD numbers released per vessel that reduces current use b A reduction in the number of FAD sets c Mandatory reporting and transparency on FAD all aspects of FAD use d A transition period to shift towards the use of biodegradable and non entangling FAD designs
WCPFC14-2017-OP14,16,As of November 29 2017 httpswwwwcpfcint While the Tropical Tuna Measure doesnt specifically address human rights issues banning transshipment and having strong MCS in place on longliners will go a long way to addressing many of the problems Low Impact Fishers Handline Pole Line We are concerned of the adverse effects of fishing in the high seas to handliners and pole and liners Tunas are shared resource Conservation and Management Measures should facilitate equitable access to the resources such that there is reasonable opportunity not only for longliners purse seiners but also for low impact fishers like handliners and pole and line We strongly recommend the participation of handliners and pole and line in the decision making processes at national level and the WCPFC Their views should be taken into account in the crafting of Conservation and Management Measures Finally the Commission should set the lead in upholding the principles of inclusivity responsibility transparency and accountability in the decision making process

WCPFC15-2018-OP02,4,Our Top Asks for WCPFC in 2018 Adopt an unambiguous effective and enforceable tuna conservation measure for all fleets that avoids increasing fishing mortality for bigeye and yellowfin Accelerate the development of harvest strategies for all key tuna species per the WCPFC Harvest Strategy Work Plan Increase the level of longline human observer coverage to 20 and finalize the development of the EMER standards for both longline and purse seine so that EM can be used to ultimately achieve observer coverage in longline fisheries consistent with the requirements for the purse seine fishery Adopt sciencebased FAD management measures including the mandatory use of non entangling FAD designs FAD marking and tracking and a specific timeframe for a transition to biodegradable FADs Undertake a thorough review of the transshipment CMM a matter of priority in 2019 to address the significant gaps in its effectiveness Reform the WCPFC compliance assessment process to ensure an effective assessment of CCMs implementation of their obligation and that provides for accredited observer participation ISSF Position Statement 2018 Page 2 10
WCPFC15-2018-OP02,5,While all stocks are classified as healthy it is important to ensure that measures clearly articulate the prescribed management measures including how and when they apply It is also essential that WCPFC measures apply to all sources of mortality and are enforceable including through the Compliance Assessment Scheme What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do Consistent with the advice of the Scientific Committee 1 Ensure the new tuna conservation and management measure i implements bigeye and yellowfin tuna management arrangements that limit fishing mortality to the current levels thereby maintaining or increasing spawning biomass until the Commission can agree on appropriate TRPs ii reduces fishing mortality in fisheries that take juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna iii adjusts fishing effort fishing days in the purse seine fishery to levels that will maintain skipjack around the TRP preferably through a Harvest Control Rule and iv removes any ambiguity and clearly articulates the obligations that CCMs are required to meet 2 Approve funding for research to i clarify the cause of the difference of bigeye tuna growth between EPO and WCPO and ii refine the tagging dataset in the WCPO to assist validating age estimates of bigeye in the WCPO Fish Aggregating Devices FADs M O N I T O R I N G M A N A G E M E N T What are the issues More data needs to be collected regarding the number of FADs being used and the details of fishing operations on individual FADs to better understand fishing capacity changes and likely impacts on WCPFCmanaged stocks That data should be used to develop sciencebased FAD management measures In preliminary analyses tracking data from FAD buoys has proven highly valuable for estimating the number of active FADs and to determine FAD fate in recent years an estimated 25 of the FADs drifted out of main fishing areas and a minimum of 5 were beached1 Also supply vessel activities related to drifting FADs increase the efficiency of the purse seiner by reducing the time needed by the purse seiner to search for or maintain FADs Noting this preliminary research outcome greater data collection is required particularly from supply vessels coupled with improved regulation and monitoring Further ISSF welcomed the creation of a WCPFC Working Group on FAD management options in 2014 and is pleased to regularly participate in its meetings We appreciate the progress made under the leadership of the FAD Management Options Working Group Chair and look forward to further progressing these issues in the region Why are we concerned The WCPFC where FAD sets account for about 30 of tropical tuna catches has yet to adopt binding regulations for the use of nonentangling or lower entangling FAD designs Given the high risk of ecosystem impacts from FADs including beaching marine debris cryptic mortality of sharks and turtles it is essential to require the use of lower entangling FAD designs and WCPFC SC14 2018MIWP09 ISSF Position Statement 2018 Page 3 10
WCPFC15-2018-OP02,6,start moving towards requiring fully nonentangling FAD designs and biodegradable FADs It is also important to consider effective FAD marking and monitoring through proven FAD tracking mechanisms What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Adopt the Scientific Committee recommendations to add a new section of FAD Information in the ROP Minimum Standard Data Fields that will include inventories of the FAD buoys on board at the start and end of each trip and field for FAD Identification 2 Strengthen conservation and management of FADs either through 200902 or 201701 to i require the mandatory use of lower entangling FAD designs and include a specific timeframe for a transition to nonentangling FAD designs and biodegradable FADs noting that further research into biodegradable materials is required ii adopt sciencebased limits on FAD deployments andor FAD sets and require that complete FAD buoy tracking data eg removal of any geofencing be provided to the Scientific Committee with appropriate time lags to ensure confidentiality if applicable and iii Ensure measures are also applicable to supply and tender vessels a ensure any FAD management measures including data collection and reporting also apply to supply and tender vessels together with fishing vessels b collect data on the number and use of supply vessels including identifying which particular purse seine vessels each support and the number of FADs being deployed and serviced by such vessels c identify on the Record of Fishing Vessels what activities supply vessels are engaged in whether they are working as bait boats servicing FADs or engaging in fishing and d ensure observer coverage requirements apply to supply vessels so data from these fishing activities are collected and reported Harvest Strategies What are the issues WCPFC needs to further accelerate the development of speciesspecific harvest strategies because although progress has been made the timeframes in the original agreed Work Plan have lapsed This years Scientific Committee recognized the need for a dedicated ScienceManagement Dialogue process as there is in other tuna RFMOs and recommended that the WCPFC 15 implement such a process in the appropriate format to expedite progress consistent with the agreed Harvest Strategy Work Plan We applaud the Secretariats work in developing the Harvest Strategy pages on the WCPFC website which brings together all of the relevant Commission work into a single location Why are we concerned Harvest Strategies which include target and limit reference points together with harvest control rules provide preagreed rules for managing fisheries resources and acting in response to stock status changes It is important to ensure that these pre agreed rules are robust because these rules and strategies help to rebuild stocks or avoid overfishing They reduce the need for protracted negotiations and delays that can lead to further stock declines ISSF Position Statement 2018 Page 4 10
WCPFC15-2018-OP02,7,What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do ISSF urges the Commission to 1 Agree to the establishment of a ScienceManagement Dialogue including adopting the Terms of Reference proposed by the Scientific Committee to expedite this work 2 Expedite the progress of harvest strategy work plan and take the action necessary this year eg a target reference point for yellowfin tuna and south Pacific albacore to allow MSE and other work to proceed as scheduled in 2019 Bycatch and Sharks S H A R K S R A Y S S E A T U R T L E S S E A B I R D S What are the issues At WCPFC 14 the Commission agreed to an intersessional working group to develop a comprehensive shark management measure that would combine the existing measures and introduce other scientifically proven mitigation measures We are pleased at the progress made throughout 2018 but we note key issues such as requiring sharks to be landed with their fins naturally attached remain under discussion The Scientific Committee also adopted the Safe Release Guidelines for Sharks and Rays This years Scientific Committee also considered research related to seabird and turtle bycatch best practices These species are highly vulnerable to the impact of fishing as they have long lives and low reproductive rates The Scientific Committee noted that the hook shielding devices are considered to be an effective mitigation measure and for it to be included in the conservation and management measure along with the extension of the measure to cover all waters south of 25 degrees South For turtles following a thorough review of all available data and literature the Scientific Committee noted that the current measure only applies to 1 of longline effort in the WCPO and that expanding the measure to require the use of mitigation measures in all longline fisheries would significantly reduce the impact on turtle populations Why are we concerned WCPFC as one of the most recent RFMO treaties has a clear mandate to manage shark fisheries together with mitigating the impact of tuna fisheries on shark populations To date there are no management arrangement for shark fisheries and the conservation and management measures for minimise shark bycatch do not reflect the scientific advice nor are they best practice In fact all of the WCPFC conservation and management measures for bycatch mitigation fall short of the scientific advice turtle mitigation measures only apply to a small proportion of the longline fishery and seabird mitigation measures need to be extended to 20 degrees South up from the 30 degrees South consistent with all other RFMOs WCPFC needs to adopt scientifically proven bycatch mitigation measures for all species For sharks there must be a requirement to land sharks with fins naturally attached For turtles circle hooks need to be used in all longline fisheries not just the shallow set fisheries as in the existing measure which account for less than 1 of the longline effort For seabirds the measure must apply to all longline fisheries south of 25 degrees South and the hook shielding devices should be included as a possible mitigation method ISSF Position Statement 2018 Page 5 10
WCPFC15-2018-OP02,8,What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Adopt a comprehensive CMM for sharks as recommended by SC14 which includes i mandatory use of all scientifically proven shark mitigation measures by longline fishing vessels ii a requirement that sharks be landed with fins still naturally attached to enable effective monitoring of the measure and speciesspecific data collection and iii a requirement that when an observer or electronic monitoring is in use for nonretention andor unwanted sharks to be hauled alongside the vessel before being cut free in order to facilitate species identification 2 Adopt the SC14 recommended Shark Research Plan and future work plan and the safe release guidelines for sharks and rays as endorsed by the Technical and Compliance Committee 3 Amend CMM 200803 on turtle mitigation to have it apply to all longline fisheries and improve the minimum data observer data requirements for turtles 4 Amend CMM 201706 on seabird mitigation to include hook shielding devices on the list of possible mitigation measures and expand the application of the measure to all longline fisheries operating in areas south of 25 degrees South Monitoring Control and Surveillance O B S E R V E R C O V E R A G E A N D E L E C T R O N I C M O N I T O R I N G What are the issues Comprehensive observer coverage is a critical component of monitoring and management of fisheries For largescale purse seiners WCPFC implemented a 100 observer coverage requirement 20 degrees north and south of the equator Yet the requirement for longline fisheries is only a minimum of 5 The science committees for IATTC and ICCAT have recommended 20 longline observer coverage a level appropriate to provide reasonable estimates of bycatch for most species for rare events even higher coverage rates may be necessary Recognising that electronic monitoring is not a replacement for onboard human observers this technology can be used where placement of human observers is not possible for example for certain fleets or vessel sizes including longliners Guidelines for using electronic monitoring including review rates by dry observers should be adopted ISSF is pleased to see continued progress on the electronic reporting standards during the intersessional period Why are we concerned Compliance data on observer coverage rates in longline fisheries shows some fleets continue to fail to meet the required minimum 5 observer coverage that was adopted in 2007 11 years ago Observer data is used for monitoring vessel compliance with management measures and is essential for independent verification of catch effort and interactions with associated species eg whale sharks The paucity of data from longline fisheries hinders scientific assessment and recommendations regarding effective conservation and management measures In addition WCPFC needs to agree to amendments to the minimum data fields for the Regional Observer Program and address ongoing concerns about the timeliness of observer reports being provided to relevant CCMs Furthermore WPCFC needs to address conduct issues to ensure a safe working environment so observers can continue to provide rigorous independent data to the Commission ISSF Position Statement 2018 Page 6 10 What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Strengthen CCM compliance with the existing minimum 5 observer coverage requirement particularly for fleets operating on the high seas by identifying and sanctioning noncompliance through the WCPFC Compliance Monitoring Scheme 2 Increase the level of longline human observer coverage to a minimum of 20 a level recommended by the scientific committees of IATTC and ICCAT to provide reasonable estimates of bycatch and to improve overall monitoring of the fishery 3 Direct the WCPFC Electronic Reporting and Electronic Monitoring Working Group to convene in 2019 to finalize the development of the electronic monitoring and reporting standards for both longline and purse seine to enable electronic systems to be used to achieve 100 observer coverage in longline fisheries and support additional data collection in purse seine fisheries and 4 Adopt amendments to the minimum data fields and ensure the submission of timely observer reports T R A N S S H I P M E N T What are the issues The annual report presented to this years Technical and Compliance Committee TCC14 meeting demonstrates continued noncompliance by the ten CCMs that authorise their vessels primarily longline vessels to undertake atsea transshipment including on the high seas CCMs are failing to meet the reporting deadlines for the required reports contained in CMM 2009 including the advanced notifications and transshipment event reports Furthermore despite CCM selfassessment of compliance with their obligation to have 100 observer coverage of all transshipments the observer reports have largely not been submitted to the Secretariat as required ISSF recognizes that electronic monitoring systems and ereporting are being tested and developed and that the Commission will also be developing Electronic Reporting Standards for Transshipment which could potentially be used to address some of these concerns We also note the progress of the Transshipment Analysis Tool that is helping to match reported transshipment with VMS records Why are we concerned Under the WCPF Convention atsea transshipment was supposed to be the exception not the rule However the ten CCMs that authorise atsea transshipment are in actual practice applying the exception to authorize 3997 vessels and failing to fully comply with WCPFC transshipment rules As high sea transshipment has been linked to IUU fishing activities labor abuses and other illicit activities ISSF remains very concerned at the ongoing noncompliance with the provisions of CMM 200906 What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do Undertake a thorough review of the transshipment measure CMM 200906 as recommended by TCC14 as a matter of priority in 2019 to address these significant gaps in its effectiveness which affect traceability of the products and could result in IUU fishing 1 Adopt amendments to CMM 200906 that include i Implementing real time or near realtime reporting for all components of transshipments particularly with the advent of electronic reporting systems ii Requiring that transshipment be reporting throughout the Convention area including atsea transshipment conducted inside EEZs iii Extending the transshipment management arrangements to bunkering vessels ISSF Position Statement 2018 Page 7 10 iv Automatically including any transshipment breaches on the draft IUU vessel list and v Replacing the clauses regarding the impracticability test and unfettered flag State authorization with clear criteria and a process for the Commission to review issued flag State authorizations against those criteria to ensure compliance 2 Adopt the EReporting Standards for Transshipment declarations and transshipment notices T R A N S P A R E N C Y I N C A T C H O R E F F O R T L I M I T S What are the issues WCPFC has adopted catch or effort limits for bigeye yellowfin skipjack and albacore tunas However during a given year there is no transparent mechanism for Member reporting when the total andor allocated catch or effort limits are being approached and if Members are within the prescribed limits This mechanism would allow RFMO CCMs and markets to make necessary conservation decisions during a given year if quotas are being achieved more quickly than anticipated Such a mechanism will also strengthen compliance monitoring and will be important for the implementation of future harvest strategies through catch or effort controls In addition scientifically designed projections useful for predicting when an overall limit could be achieved may be able to be developed by using historical patterns informed by inseason data Why are we concerned A lack of monitoring how Members are approaching or possibly exceeding annual individual catch or effort limits for particular tuna stocks or a total allowable catch or total allowable effort for a specific tuna stocks prevents rapid and precautionary conservation management and purchasing decisions within a given year It also undermines rapid detection of non compliance with catch or effort controls What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Require CCMs to report their inseason catch or effort status with respect to their Individual catch or effort limits andor annual TACs or TAEs where specified and 2 If an inseason reporting requirement is adopted request the Scientific Committee to develop quality assurance mechanisms for verification of inseason reports including through the use of electronic reporting technologies to minimize the risk of misreporting Compliance C O M P L I A N C E P R O C E S S E S What are the issues A strong compliance process improves fisheries management but in contrast to the other four tuna RFMOs the WCPFC Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS working group is closed to accredited observers The WCPFC has also not adopted a scheme of responses to noncompliance Further Members reports of the implementation of WCPFC measures known as Part II reports remain confidential and the responses of Members to identified noncompliance are not released publicly ISSF Position Statement 2018 Page 8 10 ISSF read with interest the 2018 Report of the Independent Panel Review of the Commissions Compliance Monitoring Scheme and was pleased to participate in the Intersessional Working Group on the CMS this year that was tasked with the development of a revised CMS CMM The leadership of the IWG Chair supported by the Secretariat has made progress on the new scheme but there are many issues that remain We call on all members to recall the significant progress on key issues such as the provision of operational level data that was only made possible by shining a light on some members non compliance through the CMS We will continue to work to provide creative input to address the remaining issues with the aim of implementing a strong equitable and effective CMS that seeks to improve the overall compliance by CCMs with their obligations Why are we concerned The CMS working group comprised of CCMs reviews and assesses Members implementation of critical WCFPC conservation measures and determines if there has been a compliance breach This group considers if measures are unclear or if other factors are causing gaps in full implementation by CCMs CCMs assessing their own compliance behind closed doors is not consistent with best practice Transparency in this process through the participation of accredited observers is essential for this work to be considered robust fair and trustworthy If compliance discussions take place behind closed doors with no openness or checks on accountability the public and the market may question the sustainability and effectiveness of the regions fisheries management What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Adopt a durable compliance monitoring measure and reform its CMS process so that accredited observers may attend the working group meetings and information on CCMs plans to address the areas of identified noncompliance be made public 2 Review the elements of the Part II report and make public all elements that can be ie only limit the information which is truly nonpublic such as VMS data to provide clear information on how CCMs have given effect to the adopted conservation and management measures and 3 Develop a scheme of responses for example increased observer coverage port sampling or limits on the use of specific gears when a CCM has been assessed as being noncompliant as soon as possible Capacity Management V E S S E L R E G I S T R I E S F L E E T C A P A C I T Y What are the issues Experts agree that there is overcapacity too many vessels in the global tuna fleets Why are we concerned ISSF continues to be concerned with the global growth of fishing capacity in WCPFC Fishing fleet overcapacity increases pressure to weaken management measures and eventually it leads to stock overexploitation What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Establish limited entry through closed vessel registries and develop a common currency to measure fishing capacity such as cubic meters of well volume ISSF Position Statement 2018 Page 9 10 2 To impose and enforce as a precautionary measure measures to limit longliner capacity in the Convention Area and task the SC to make recommendations regarding the levels of longline capacity consistent with sustainable management of target tuna stocks and 3 Support the Kobe III call for creating mechanisms to transfer capacity to developing countries ISSF Position Statement 2018 Page 10 10 Did you know ISSF is leading research on biodegradable FADs in collaboration with fleets operating in the EPO coastal nations and other stakeholders ISSF develops resources for the vessel community including skippers guidebooks on bycatchmitigation techniques and as well as reports on electronic monitoring and vessel monitoring systems ISSF offers guidelines for implementing nonentangling FADs ISSF Global Priorities for Tuna RFMOs Implementation of rigorous harvest strategies including harvest control rules and reference points Effective management of fleet capacity including developing mechanisms that support developing coastal state engagement in the fishery Sciencebased FAD management nonentangling FAD designs Increased member compliance with all adopted measures adopted and greater transparency

WCPFC15-2018-OP04,2,COMMISSION FIFTEENTH REGULAR SESSION Honolulu Hawaii USA 14 December 2018 POSITION STATEMENT TO WCPFC15 WCPFC152018OP04 November 2018
WCPFC15-2018-OP04,3,Pew Charitable Trusts Pew
WCPFC15-2018-OP04,4,WCPFC Must Commit to Science Based Management LongTerm Sustainabilityth annual meeting 1014 December 2018 Honolulu Hawaii US A brief from Nov 2018 Overview The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC is responsible for the effective longterm conservation management of highly migratory fish stocks including tunas and sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean The Pew Charitable Trusts calls on members cooperating members and nonmembers to take the following critical actions at the 15th annual meeting of the Commission from 914 December 2018 in Honolulu Hawaii US1 Agree on steps to further develop harvest strategies Although some progress has been made in developing elements of harvest strategies for different tuna species the WCPFC must continue to follow its workplan The next step would be to agree on a precautionary target reference point TRP for South Pacific albacore even if only on an interim basis In addition the Commission should clarify management objectives for bigeye and yellowfin as it prepares to adopt TRPs for those stocks next year In doing so members must specify that the acceptable risk of breaching the limit reference point LRP should be 5 percent or less in keeping with the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement Steve TrainoffGetty Images Finally the WCPFC should create a harvest strategy development working group as recommended by the Scientific Committee SC to improve the dialogue among scientists and managers on the elements of harvest strategies2 The working group should be empowered to hold informal sessions to facilitate open dialogue and capacity building as well as formal sessions to make recommendations directly to the Commission Reduce the impacts of fish aggregating devices FADs The WCPFC should seize an opportunity to improve the management of FADs in Pacific waters The Commission should adopt the minimum guidelines on nonentangling FADs developed by the FAD Working Groupbut require that they be followed3 That would bring the WCPFC to the standard set by other tuna regional fisheries management organizations RFMOs In addition the WCPFC should reduce the limit on the number of FADs that vessels can have in the water at one time work to reduce plastic in FADs and task the working group with recommending strategies for better control and retrieval of FADs These steps would align with the advice of the SC Research presented to the committee this year found that at least 26 percent of deployed FADs could be considered lost while at least 5 percent wash up on shores or reefs4 In addition ocean areas with greater densities of FADs may experience reduced catch per unit of effort for tunas indicating potential fragmentation of schools5 Fish aggregating devices and the material to make them are seen on board a purse seine vessel The Pew Charitable Trusts Ensure that bigeye tuna are managed for longterm sustainability The tropical tuna bridging measure Conservation and Management Measure CMM 201701 specifies that the spawning biomass of bigeye tuna be maintained at or above the average of the ratio between current biomass levels and the levels that would exist in the absence of fishing for adult fish SBSBF0 for 201215 pending agreement on a future TRP for the stock6 This year the WCPFC will reexamine key provisions of that measure including the length of the FAD closure and the longline catch limit scheme for bigeye The Commission must maintain that spawning biomass ensure a very low probability of breaching the LRP and minimize the probability that overfishing could occur Further in the purse seine fishery the WCPFC should replace the FAD closure period with sciencebased limits on FAD sets which would provide greater control over juvenile and smallbigeye mortality Adopt an effective and transparent compliance monitoring scheme CMS Achieving sustainable fisheries requires a robust compliance scheme With the existing CMS set to expire in the WCPFC must adopt a new one to ensure that it can assess Commission members compliance with WCPFC obligations The CMS should support Commission objectives fully and transparently To that end Pew urges that the new scheme require that flag States provide information on allegations of noncompliance with Commission measures the actions taken by States in response and the final disposition The system should include a protocol for the Technical and Compliance Committee TCC to review investigations and responses Pew also urges that observers be permitted in compliance discussions among member States as allowed by the WCPFC Convention In addition the Commission should commit to developing agreeing on and implementing penalties for serious andor persistent noncompliance Reform transshipment at sea Transshipment at sea continues to provide opportunities for misreporting and laundering illegal unreported and unregulated IUU catch Pew calls for a ban on transshipment at sea in the Convention area until best practices are implemented to increase transparency and ensure a strong legal and verifiable seafood supply chain This year the TCC recommended that the Commission review the existing transshipment measure CMM 2009 as a priority item in 20197 Pew urges the Commission to establish an intersessional working group to guide this effort before next years TCC meeting The revised measure should include the following best practices Put in place consistent nearrealtime transshipment reporting requirements for all vessels and areas within the Convention area including all transfers of catch that occur in port or within national exclusive economic zones Require that transshipment authorizations and declarations be sent to all relevant authorities including the secretariat and that carrier vessels notify the secretariat of their intent to transship WCPFCmanaged species when entering the Convention area Require all vessels involved in transshipment activities to carry observers who provide independent observer reports directly to the secretariat In addition WCPFC should Develop strict guidelines to limit the number of vessels that can transship under the impracticable exemption Establish or strengthen formal transshipping datasharing agreements with neighboring RFMOs and the companies that provide onboard observers to their vessels Increase longline observer coverage and electronic monitoring EM Technological advances coupled with more costeffective EM systems can help improve fisheries management and ensure high levels of compliance with CMMs Many WCPFC member States have embraced these technologies as effective management tools for their domestic fisheries Pew calls on Commission members to support the work of the ERandEM Working Group in developing EM standards The Commission also should commit to requiring 100 percent observer coverage on longline vesselsas now required on purse seine vesselsby complementing onboard human observers with EM once standards have been adopted The Pew Charitable Trusts Tuna caught by purse seine vessels being transshipped in Pohnpei Micronesia IMO numbers make vessels easier to positively identify The unique sevendigit number issued to each vessel preceded by the letters IMO stays with a vessel until it is scrapped regardless of ownership country of registration or name The Pew Charitable Trusts Extend the International Maritime Organization IMO number requirement Member States have made great progress in providing IMO numbers for most active eligible vessels although gaps remain Member States should ensure that no vessels required to have IMO numbers are fishing without them IMO numbers should be clearly included in all vessel records In addition Pew urges the Commission to extend the requirement for IMO numbers to include motorized inboard fishing vessels of less than 100 gross tonnes down to those at least 12 meters in length overall The requirement should apply to all vessels authorized to fish in the Convention area beyond national jurisdiction in accordance with the recommendation made by the th regular session of the TCC Enhance the IUU fishing vessel list Today those found to be engaged in IUU fishing can be added to the IUU vessel list only once a year That means these vessels can operate unhindered until the Commission meets and action is taken to list them The WCPFC permits vessels to be removed from the IUU vessel list between annual meetings and should also permit adding to the list intersessionally Implement port State measures At its last meeting the WCPFC boosted efforts to fight IUU fishing with the adoption of minimum standards for port State measures PSMs a costeffective approach to preventing illegally caught fish from entering the market Implementation of CMM 201702 which spelled out those processes and procedures is now key8 In the runup to the Commission meeting every port CCM should designate a port or ports for inspection by port authorities of vessels suspected of engaging in IUU fishing or fishingrelated activities and identify the national contact point for PSMs Pew encourages the Commission through the 12th Finance and Administration Committee to define the funding mechanism to support small island developing States and participating territories in applying PSMs and to ensure that capacity assistance is streamlined with other initiatives within the region and globally Strengthen conservation and management of sharks The WCPFC must make reducing shark mortality an urgent priority Until measures are in place to ensure that both targeted and incidental catch of sharks is sustainable harvest of these species should be avoided Management measures such as prohibitions or catch limits should reflect the precautionary principle especially when limited population data results in uncertain stock assessments Fishing gear that increases the likelihood of shark catch such as wire leaders and shark lines should be prohibited The Commission also should require that fins be naturally attached when sharks are landed A Pacificwide assessment for the bigeye thresher shark shows that management action is needed for this vulnerable species Prohibiting retention of these sharks also would help member States meet their requirements for the Appendix II listing on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Pew welcomes the work undertaken to develop an overarching shark CMM to help the WCPFC better manage both targeted shark fisheries and incidental catch and hopes that it can be concluded this year Conclusion Although the WCPFC has made some progress towards sciencebased management of some tuna fisheries and in the fight against IUU fishing more needs to be done to ensure the health of the tunas and sharks under its purview By implementing these recommendations the Commission and would take important steps towards sustainably managed Pacific fisheries

WCPFC15-2018-OP05,6,Dear Delegates
WCPFC15-2018-OP05,7,This letter is submitted on behalf of the undersigned companies nongovernmental organizations and fishing industry associations all of whom recognize that the sustainability of tuna stocks is integral to businesses and livelihoods as well as to the health of the marine environment
WCPFC15-2018-OP05,8,The companies represent major seafood buyers that source seafood products from a diverse international supply network
WCPFC15-2018-OP05,9,The nongovernmental organizations work in more than 100 countries and engage suppliers and provide advice to retailers buyers and food service companies regarding improvements in tuna sustainability
WCPFC15-2018-OP05,10,The fishing industry associations represent a variety of gear types including purse seine longline troll pole and line and handline vessels active in tuna fisheries worldwide
WCPFC15-2018-OP05,11,Your government serves as an important leader in tuna stock sustainability as a member of one or more of the four regional fisheries management organizations RFMOs charged with managing the worlds tropical tuna fisheries We are writing to bring to your attention our collective views on several issues crucial to the longterm sustainability of tuna stocks
WCPFC15-2018-OP05,12,The development and implementation of comprehensive precautionary harvest strategies
WCPFC15-2018-OP05,13,Effective monitoring and management of fish aggregating devices FADs
WCPFC15-2018-OP05,14,Strengthened monitoring control and surveillance tools including increased observer coverage in purse seine and longline fisheries and of atsea transshipment activity through human observers andor electronic monitoring
WCPFC15-2018-OP05,15,Greater focus on implementation of bycatch mitigation actions broadly with an emphasis on longline fisheries
WCPFC15-2018-OP05,16,We recognize that certain tuna RFMOs have made progress on several of these issues and we applaud those actions
WCPFC15-2018-OP05,17,However we wish to underscore that while the progress todate is positive accelerated actions must be taken at this years RFMO meetings to
WCPFC15-2018-OP05,18,Develop and implement comprehensive precautionary harvest strategies with specific timelines for all tuna stocks including the adoption and implementation of target and limit reference points harvest control rules monitoring strategies operational objectives performance indicators and management strategy evaluation Adopt a 100 observer coverage requirement for purse seine vessels where it is not already required and require the use of the bestavailable observer safety equipment communications and procedures Increase compliance with mandatory minimum 5 longline observer coverage rates by identifying and sanctioning noncompliance and adopt and implement a 100 observer coverage requirement human andor electronic within five years for longline fisheries Adopt and implement a 100 observer coverage requirement for atsea transshipment activities as well as other measures that ensure transshipment activity is transparent and well managed and that all required data is fully collected and sent to the appropriate bodies in a timely manner Develop and implement sciencebased recommendations for the effective management of FADs and integrate FADbased information into stock assessments to reduce uncertainties Adopt effective measures for the use of nonentangling FAD designs as a precautionary measure to minimize the entanglement of sharks and other nontarget species and support research on biodegradable materials and transition to their use to mitigate marine debris More effectively implement and ensure compliance with existing RFMO bycatch requirements and take additional mitigation action such as improving monitoring at sea collecting and sharing operationallevel speciesspecific data and adopting stronger compliance measures including consequences for noncompliance for all gear types
WCPFC15-2018-OP05,19,Collectively we believe these measures will positively impact the longterm sustainability of tuna stocks and the overall health of the marine ecosystem
WCPFC15-2018-OP05,20,We request that your government as a member of one or more of the tuna RFMOs take active steps to ensure significant progress on these issues at each of the relevant RFMO meetings in 2018 as a matter of priority

WCPFC15-2018-OP06,9,Recommendations to the 15th Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission
WCPFC15-2018-OP06,10,The International Game Fish Association IGFA is a nonprofit organization that represents recreational anglers throughout the world IGFA was established in 1939 has active members in over 150 countries and provides rules for ethical angling practices Many of IGFAs members target the highly migratory species managed by WCPFC especially marlin sailfish and spearfish ie billfish which are primarily caught and released
WCPFC15-2018-OP06,11,IGFA has great concern about how highly migratory species are being managed on a global level for recreational anglers The lack of data and accurate reporting on billfish catch is of particular concern As an organization that is committed to the conservation of game fishes IGFA has deployed over 350 popup satellite archival tags in marlin around the world in the past seven years many of which have been in the area under this organizations purview The information gained from this exercise is available to your scientific committee
WCPFC15-2018-OP06,12,Billfish
WCPFC15-2018-OP06,13,Striped Marlin The IGFAs primary concern for the 15th Regular Session of the Commission is the status of striped marlin According to the last stock assessment 2015 the WCNPO stock has experienced a longterm decline in population biomass and the stock is currently overfished and experiencing overfishing Spawning stock biomass is estimated at 1094 t or just 39 of SSBMSY Fishing mortality on the stock is exceptionally high and the stock has been experiencing overfishing since 1977 with the exception of two years Current fishing mortality is 49 above that necessary to achieve FMSY Still with the stock both overfished and experiencing overfishing no target or limit reference points have been established by the WCPFC As such a robust rebuilding plan for this stock is necessary
WCPFC15-2018-OP06,14,The Scientific Committee has noted that in order for the stock to rebuild the catch needs to be reduced to less than 2850 t Due to the severely depleted nature of the stock the IGFA recommends that catches be limited to no more than 2500 t to give the stock a reasonable chance of rebuilding and to take into account uncertainties with catch reporting In addition the IGFA supports the Northern Committees recommendation that additional reduction scenarios should be explored if the probability of reaching the rebuilding target is not at least 60 The IGFA also strongly supports the Northern Committees recommendation to make developing a rebuilding plan for striped marlin a priority for the WCPFC
WCPFC15-2018-OP06,15,Black Marlin and Sailfish No formal stock assessments exist for sailfish and black marlin Better data collection is necessary for these species so that their true abundance can be accurately estimated
WCPFC15-2018-OP06,16,General Recommendations Although primarily a commercial bycatch species billfish are highly sought after recreational species that are primarily caught and released Recreational fisheries for billfish also yield significant economic benefits at the regional level As such the IGFA recommends that all countries be required to report dead discards and use circle hooks in their longline fisheries to reduce fishing mortality and improve the survival of released fish

WCPFC15-2018-OP07,6,Introduction The World Wide Fund for Nature WWF would like to again thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC for the opportunity to attend the 15th Regular Session as an observer and to address the critically important role that it plays in the proper management of the Western Central Pacific Ocean WCPO fisheries WWF once again calls on members of the WCPFC to address the issues and recommendations raised at SC14 NC14 TCC14 and WCPFC14 as well as observe the experience of other RFMOs in their own efforts to achieve and maintain improved measures for monitoring and surveillance WWF would like to note that this Position Statement is not comprehensive but that fact does not mean that WWF does not think that other issues not included herein are not important WWF wishes to reiterate its position offered in Manila Philippines in December 2017 WCPFC14 and taking into account the WCPFCrelated meetings held since the recommendations listed below as well as other documents submitted to the WCPFC for review as Observer Papers Reference Points Harvest Control Rules and Harvest Strategies WWF remains supportive of the work of the WCPFC and subsidiary bodies in pursuing the implementation of a Harvest Strategy HS approach as agreed under CMM 201406 and Supplementary Information on Workplan workplan for the adoption of Harvest Strategies Consistent with previous WWF position statements and recommendations WWF continues to encourage WCPFC14 to further endorse and support the adoption of explicit Limit and Target Reference Points LRPTRP Harvest Control Rules HCRs and HSs for all WCPO fishery stocks under WCPFC authority Gregg Yan WWF
WCPFC15-2018-OP07,7,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 15th Regular Session Honolulu Hawaii United States 914 December 2018 WCPFC15 This year the WCPFC should clarify and confirm management objectives for bigeye BET and yellowfin YFT as it prepares to adopt TRPs for those stocks next year In doing so members must also specify that the acceptable risk of breaching the limit reference point LRP should be 5 per cent or less in keeping with the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement WWF also urges WCPFC15 to adopt riskbased methods for assessing nontarget shark species with a view to adopting and implementing reference points for associated species WWF again notes the importance of and strong support for these important management measures specifically the adoption of TRPs and HCRs for the key target species particularly from industry participants with Marine Stewardship Council MSC certification and many end markets Therefore WWF encourages WCPFC15 to maintain momentum on implementation of HS elements and where necessary take steps to recover timelines under the workplan WWF recommends that the WCPFC Support and endorse further implementation of CMM 201406 on Establishing a Harvest Strategy for Key Tuna Species in the WCPO consistent with proposed timelines Confirm that the acceptable risk of breaching an LRP is 5 per cent or less Establish a TRP for the South Pacific albacore SP ALB longline LL fishery Endorse further HCR development and implementation for the skipjack SKJ purse seine PS fishery Support further development of interim precautionary TRPs for BET and YFT and Support the continued development and implementation of LRPs and TRPs as a priority for proper management of all stocks including sharks Sharks and Rays Many shark species in the WCPO remain subject to high levels of fishing mortality that current stock assessment trends suggest could be unsustainable1 Sharks play a critical role in the WCPO marine ecosystem as apex predators and indicators of ecosystem health2 WWF is concerned with shark conservation and sustainability in the WCPFC region as a whole and considers responsible management trade and consumption where shark mortality occurs in all fishing activities not just in circumstances where tuna fishing is occurring Therefore WCPFC must also recognise the needs of coastal States in the WCPFC region to manage their shark populations The assessment for bigeye thresher shark indicates that management action is necessary for this vulnerable species Given the poor stock status and equivalent position to oceanic whitetip and silky sharks a retention prohibition of these sharks would be consistent with prior WCPFC action while also assisting member States in meeting their requirements under Appendix II of CITES Although WWF supports the continued efforts toward the development of a Comprehensive Shark CMM we believe that specific components should be maintained or strengthened to ensure that the measure is ultimately effective WWF again commends the previous efforts and recommendations made by the ABNJ Common Oceans project in support of a proposed comprehensive and integrated shark CMM3 WWF recommends the WCPFC Adopt a Comprehensive Shark CMM that includes a new framework incorporating existing CMMs but also providing for national contributions toward commonly agreed goals for shark stocks including

WCPFC15-2018-OP07,10,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 15th Regular Session Honolulu Hawaii United States 914 December 2018 WCPFC15 3 improve the definition of the desired outcomes of the CMM Moreover evidence suggests that the WCPFC and member states have not suitably monitored the CMM for effectiveness with some parts of the CMM distinguished as providing excessive room for creative compliance4 The majority of CCMs either have not fully reported on compliance with CMM 200803 or have not met all the CMM measures Furthermore only a small fraction of member countries have conducted dedicated research on sea turtle mitigation techniques and current observer coverage falls well below the recommended level for effectively determining optimal mitigation approaches ie 10 coverage over 3 years Thus WWF again urges WCPFC to support the revision or replacement of CMM 200803 to include stronger and clearer requirements for adoption of mitigation measures and their specifications We also note the lack of inclusion in the scientific data standards of any data related to sea turtle encounters despite the scope of CMM 20157 includes reportingwith respect to implementation of measures for nontarget species and given the major gaps in annual reporting against CMM 2008 We suggest that such information should be specifically included in assessment criteria and in data standards including where appropriate data on sea turtle encounters including data on hook rates type and other factors comparative to hook type and bait WWF recommends the WCPFC Endorse revising or replacing CMM 200803 to include interim measures that would require members to determine optimum bycatch mitigation via usetesting of alternative hooks andor bait and to report on these results as well as reducing the technical vagueness in desired outcomes of the CMM Encourage member state involvement and participation in the research conducted under the analysis of sea turtle mitigation measure effectiveness in tuna longline fisheries and Support the inclusion of sea turtle data in monitoring scheme assessment criteria and related data standards Regional Observer Programme Information collected as part of an appropriate observer programme is critically important to the proper management of a fishery Data collected by observers plays a central role in informing fisheries scientists on everything ranging from stock assessments to nontarget species impacts Furthermore observers play an indispensable role in monitoring and enforcing very important CMMs in the WCPO Indeed observers represent the vanguard of fisheries management through the science and service that they provide Consequently observer safety and security as well as appropriate observer coverage must be considered a top priority and greater support must be provided to the relevant authority to see that the capacity of the WCPFC Regional Observer Programme ROP is strengthened Observer Safety and Security WWF commends the WCPFCs previous actions to address issues with observer safety and security through the adoption of the observer safety and security provisions as well as the flag and coastal state requirements However WWF continues to strongly believe that more needs to be done to fully address observer safety and security Specifically WWF maintains that there is a need for a full and transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents One of the outstanding gaps in observer safety and security is represented by the lack of information available to address observer incidents through proper followup and documentation A requirement for full and transparent reporting will allow for identification and understanding of potentially dangerous situations for future observers Until the
WCPFC15-2018-OP07,11,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 15th Regular Session Honolulu Hawaii United States 914 December 2018
WCPFC15-2018-OP07,12,WWF Position WCPFC can fully understand the circumstances surrounding these incidents it cannot hope to properly address them The ROP Annual Report as it currently exists does not provide the necessary level of detail to properly address these issues Thus WWF recommends establishing a required comprehensive and transparent reporting procedure for observers and observer programmes to report instances of threats harrassment intimidation assault or death that national programmes and the ROP could then use to determine solutions to prevent future instances This procedure must include an annual publicly available consolidated detailed and fully transparent report of all infractions against observers Observer Coverage on Longline Vessels WWF notes that observer coverage on longline vessels operating in the WCPO regardless of the metrics used to calculate it remains substantially less than 5 regionwide Moreover WWF wishes to emphasise that the 5 observer coverage value identified by the WCPFC represents an arbitrary benchmark that was never intended to represent an end goal but rather a minimum starting point toward appropriate observer coverage Even a consistently applied level of 5 coverage is statistically and practically useless for most management or monitoring control and surveillance MCS purposes Moreover after more than 10 years of the enactment of the requirement many CCMs still have not achieved the required 5 coverage Therefore WWF strongly supports efforts to improve the observer coverage of all longline fisheries in the WCPO Under the WCPFC Convention CCMs are obliged to use the best available scientific evidence5 However the WCPFC cannot develop the best available science if the underlying data is poor leading to the problem of garbage in garbage out As such while WWF supports calculating observer coverage according to the proposed hierarchy of four metrics for assessing observer coverage we note that best practice as defined by the scientific services provider would be to use number of hooks deployed which would also lead to the production of the best available science WWF also notes that different levels of observer coverage may be required for management or compliance purposes depending on specific identified objectives and recommends that appropriate analyses be conducted to determine each of those levels respectively in the context of identified objectives However peerreviewed research that constitutes the best available science indicates a minimum of 20 observer coverage is necessary to secure an appropriate level of statistical significance for stock assessment purposes6 As evidenced by some CCMs ability to achieve it 20 coverage is not only the best available science but is also a reasonable and achievable minimum level to aim for WWF also believes that Electronic Monitoring EM is an important tool to help CCMs meet their observer coverage obligations WWF appreciates and even shares some concerns with some CCMs regarding the equivalency of data collected by EM versus human observers and that those differences could further complicate how we assess the level of observer coverage However existing scientific assessment suggests that EM can currently produce many of the important ROP data fields for longline fisheries and that those fields that EM falls short on may be dealt with over time Thus where information collected by EM is potentially equivalent EM should be considered in the ROP coverage metrics with the understanding that analyses should be conducted to help standardise the approach WWF recommends the WCPFC Endorse further observer safety and security measures including fully transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents and persons involved and Endorse an analysis of levels of observer coverage required to achieve management or compliance purposes while ensuring that the metrics and methodologies used support development of appropriate comparative analyses that meet the needs of the Scientific Services Provider and any MCS objectives
WCPFC15-2018-OP07,13,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 15th Regular Session Honolulu Hawaii United States 914 December 2018 WCPFC15 Transhipment Monitoring Transhipment remains one of the most prominent weaknesses in catch documentation and verification that leads to Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU catch in the WCPO WWF notes that the most simple efficient and effective solution to the challenges of transhipmentrelated IUU is to simply prohibit all atsea transhipment and require all fishing vessels to either tranship or land their catch at the nearest available designated port in the WCPO following the conclusion of fishing activity However acknowledging that a prohibition on transhipment is politically unlikely at this time WWF supports the review and revision of CMM 200906 to address deficiencies in the current measure There are currently ten countries that permit their flag vessels to conduct atsea transhipment While atsea transhipment is permissible if a member country states that it is impractical to conduct transhipment in port ambiguity in CMM 200906 particularly requirements around proving impracticability have resulted in an increasing number of vessels conducting atsea transhipment on the high seas of western and central Pacific Ocean While it was intended to be an exception to in port delivery atsea transhipment has become the rule observer coverage of atsea transhipment on carrier vessels represents a critical monitoring feature of the atsea transhipment regulations in the WCPO Yet some CCMs are consistently non compliant with these regulations For instance the WCPFC Secretariat received only one carrier observer report for the 2045 high seas transhipments reported in the Convention area in 2016 and Along with failing to provide observer reports to WCPFC these CCMs are also not providing basic reporting requirements such as advance notification of the intention to tranship nor transhipment events themselves WWF also recommends that the WCPFC adopt realtime or near realtime electronic reporting requirements for transhipment notification These requirements should be buttressed by electronic verification and validation tools such as redundant AIS or VMS transponders and EM If through investigation suspected unreported transhipment activity is detected and corroborated by these additional tools and authorities determine that the transhipment activity was conducted in violation of transhipment rules the offending vessels should be subject to strong sanctions including listing on the draft IUU vessel blacklist The Technical and Compliance Committee TCC14 identified the review of the CMM 200906 transhipment requirements as a priority Therefore we strongly recommend the WCPFC undertake a thorough review of CMM 200906 in 2019 and adopt substantive improvements as recommended by TCC14 WWF recommends the WCPFC Implement real time or near realtime reporting requirements for all components of transhipments including electronic verification and validation tools Review and revise CMM 200906 including replacing the impracticability test and unfettered flag State authorization with clear criteria and a process for the WCPFC to review issued flag State authorizations against those criteria to ensure compliance and Consider automatically including any vessel that breaches transhipment regulations on the draft IUU vessel list Pacific Bluefin Tuna Technical reports of all scientific and management bodies responsible for management of the Pacific bluefin tuna stock including the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike Species in
WCPFC15-2018-OP07,14,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 15th Regular Session Honolulu Hawaii United States 914 December 2018
WCPFC15-2018-OP07,15,WWF Position the North Pacific Ocean ISC and the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC indicate that the Pacific Bluefin PBF tuna stock remains in extremely poor condition The ISC and Scientific Committee SC14 both note that the stock is both overfished relative to the potential biomassbased reference points evaluated SSBMED and 20SSBF0 as well as subject to overfishing relative to most of potential fishing intensitybased reference points evaluated7 Furthermore even though the spawning stock biomass is only at 33 of its unfished level some CCMs were unable to reduce pressure on the stock as recommended in 2017 leading to a catch increase of 11 from 2016 to 2017 SC14 notes that projections of spawning stock biomass are strongly influenced by the inclusion of a singular anomalous and relatively high but uncertain recruitment in 2016 Due to this strong uncertainty in stock projections the majority of CCMs recommended a precautionary approach to the management of Pacific Bluefin tuna especially in relation to the timing of increasing catch levels until the rebuilding of the stock to higher biomass levels is achieved Without the robust and precautionary longterm rebuilding target the recovery of the stock may be further delayed if the current scenario of low recruitment continues which is heavily reliant on a significantly uncertain recruitment cohort Furthermore reports indicate that the member states that catch Pacific bluefin tuna exceeded their catch limits in both 2016 and 2017 As demonstrated by this continued increase in catch despite calls for reductions some CCMs have proven incapable of acting responsibly to conserve the Pacific bluefin tuna resource Thus WWF strongly recommends the WCPFC strengthen its monitoring control and surveillance MCS and to establish a catch documentation scheme CDS by 2020 in accordance with the adopted workplan established at WCPFC14 as well as to improve member state compliance with the management measures including firm and tangible sanctions for noncompliance WWF reiterates its strong disappointment for the reservation made by Japan at NC14 As the most dominant fishing country of the PBF stock WWF strongly urges Japan to withdraw their reservation and demonstrate their strong commitment to lead the robust rebuilding plan of the PBF stock Therefore WWF continues to urge the WCPFC to adopt a longterm Pacific bluefin tuna recovery plan targeting at least 20SSB0 and harvest control rules that are welldefined preagreed and contain mandatory actions for a determined course of management action in response to changes in indicators of stock status with respect to reference points through an ongoing MSE process WWF recommends that the WCPFC Recommend to not increase the catch limit for both juvenile and adult fish until achieving the rebuilding target Establish a Catch Documentation Scheme CDS for the thorough monitoring of Pacific bluefin tuna by 2020 and Ensure compliance of management measure for Pacific bluefin tuna by member states

WCPFC15-2018-OP09,10,Continue progress of harvest strategies for all major tuna stocks to avoid adverse impacts on the stocks while also recognizing the social and economic dependence of coastal communities on the fisheries To this end we encourage the adoption of an interim target reference point for south Pacific albacore and the establishment of a ScienceManagement Dialogue Strengthen the management of tropical tunas in line with the advice from the Scientific Committee SC to avoid overfishing in the future and ensure the continued opportunities for onebyone fisheries eg pole and line handline and troll coastal fisheries and communities in line with the UN Fish Stock Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals Improve the monitoring and regulation of fish aggregating devices FADs and purse seine supply vessels to better understand the impacts on fishing efficiency and inform future management This should include establishing comprehensive systems to accurately quantify numbers of FADs and active buoys establishing widescale collection of individual FAD deployment tracking and sethistory data and ensuring access to FAD data for scientists and managers Reduce marine pollution including plastics and FADs which wash ashore and damage coastal habitats by requiring fully biodegradable materials in drifting FAD construction Also ensure that FAD owners recover drifting FADs while at sea prior to beaching events and use available information to inform mitigation initiatives Adopt measures that will effectively reduce bycatch and protect endangered threatened or protected species including sharks seabirds cetaceans and sea turtles A comprehensive shark measure as recommended by the SC should be adopted this year Additionally requiring nonentangling FADs will greatly reduce impacts of ghost fishing on sharks and sea turtles Improve Monitoring Control and Surveillance in relation to longline fishing activities to reduce illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing through enhanced observer coverage including through electronic monitoring systems and strengthening atsea transhipment measures
WCPFC15-2018-OP09,11,There are several proposals on the table for this years Regular Session which will advance these key issues and we hope common ground can be found Progress across all of these areas is needed as more sustainable management frameworks will benefit every CCM bring positive longterm returns to fishing communities and minimise the risk of future fisheries collapse We look forward to working with delegates as well as with our Members to strive for the highest standards of sustainability and equity in fisheries management to reinforce the good work of the Commission

WCPFC15-2018-OP16,2,Submitted by Ocean Friends Against Driftnets
WCPFC15-2018-OP16,3,WCPFC152018OP16 December 2018
WCPFC15-2018-OP16,4,ODAD Report on the Pacific Albacore Troll Fishery in the WCPFA 2018 By Captain John Harder FV OCEAN JOY The South Pacific Albacore Troll Fishery has been on the decline for the past 12 years and the North Pacific Albacore inside the Convention area is practically nonexistent for 15 years The South Pacific Albacore Troll fleet consisted of around 12 vessels this year Less than 400 tons were caught by the jig fleet The area of fish found was not healthy enough to support the amount of vessels fishing The fleet struggled to make expanses There are only 6 vessels starting the 2019 South Pacific Albacore season as of now Most all are owed by one company otherwise there would be less Albacore Troll vessels tried fishing in the North Pacific Convention Area only to fail in their efforts to find any productive area What they did find was wads of driftnet debris from 31N x 170E 38 N x 176179E This happened to be in the same area that was reported last year by authorities to have had no driftnet activity
WCPFC15-2018-OP16,5,The 3 vessels left the area emptyhanded and returned to the west coast where there was productive catches reported By mid Sepember reports of driftnet scratched fish were beeing sighted off the coast of Washington Oregon Canada
WCPFC15-2018-OP16,6,The West Coast Albacore Troll season was not much better than the preveous 2017 season which was one of the worst seasons ever Average season on the coast would have been less than 50 tons per vessel A normal season for a North Pacific Albacore Troller would be around 100 tons Each vessel would normaly catch around 1 ton per day In Conclusion Albacore Stocks are well below MSY for the Sustainable Pacific Albacore Troll Fishery to opperate due to IUU driftnet fishing and or overfishing by longline fishing vessels
WCPFC15-2018-OP16,7,OFAD Pacific Albacore Trollers beeing primary stakeholders as fishers request to the WCPFC15 the following provisions Ban all driftnets for highly migratory species or any other speciesincluding squid as it infringes on our benefits and violates our freedom of the sea in international law Organize a Pacific Albacore Trollers Fund made by the commission to pay a reward of 50000000 for information leeding to a conviction of any IUU driftnet vessels All transhipments of Albacore coming from the Northwestern quadrant be under suspision of IUU fishing 100 observers on all carrior or freezer ships efective emedeately All observer organizations must make sure that obervers are educated in detecting tuna caught using the method of driftnets Make sure there is a space in the reports made to verrify if fish caught was by driftnets or not20 observer coverage on all longline vessels over 100 ton gross weight efective emedeatly To be 100 observer coverage on longline vessels within 2 years Heavy fines for any vessels caught such as 1 million USD and seize the load We ask that any vessel that is not otherized to transship and otherwize dose pay a heavy fine seize the load We ask the commission to consider any transshipping that was unotherized or not observed to be deemed IUU fish confinscated with a million USD fine That all transhipments must be submitted to the secritariate with a cargo manafest prior to the transhipment date That transshipping be redused by 50 efective emedeatly and be eliminated by the next 2 years We ask that the commission reduse the Albacore Longline effort by 20 in both north and south pacific efective emedeatly OFAD Albacore Trollers in the Convention area request that the commission make a motion to Ban the use of pair trawlling for highly migratory species especialy Albacore tuna as the Pacific Ocean has a Troll fishery and therefor would be again infringing on our bennifits and rights to freedom of the sea We also ask for total transparency of the TCC relating to the taking of Albacore in the Pacific whethere it be compliant or non compliant as we are fishers and are efected dirrectly We should be allowed freedom of information to all that pertains to us fisherpersons Distingwished members of the WCPFC The Pacific Albacore Troll Fishery is a frail and fragile fishery that relies on healthy albacore stocks far greater than the scope of science or best avalabel science without the consideration of the fishery itself Science can not explain why a spacific species of tuna such as the Albacore can be harvested by trolling and be productive like no other Nor can science explain the changing of the nature of the species after it has been targetted by driftnets Tuna that have been introduced to driftnets tend to stop feeding on the surface and therfore uncatchable by trolling It only takes 12 years of driftnet fishing to deminish a whole fleet of trolling vessels This has been proven before in the 1980s and is apon us now Driftnets have been harvesting Albacore in the WCPFA for the past 15 years Albacore trollers have stopped beeing productive for the same amount of time Our livelyhoods depend on this commission to enforce the law with 0 tollerance We ask that high sanctions and or tarrifs be put on the countries that are repeat offenders using IUU driftnets OFAD Pacific Albacore Trollers would like to request that the commission make a rulling that forbids any pole and line vessel Example Japanies pole boats to come within 4 miles of a Albacore troll vessel durring fishing or daylight hrs It happens to be a fact that once the tuna start taking to the bait they will not feed on the jigs This also infringes on our bennifits and takes away from our freedom of the sea Let the bait boats find their own fish and we jig boats will do the same We would also request that the commission form a Pacific Albacore Trollers Fund for a collection of funds to aid our fishery in funding 3 observer vessels to resurch west of the dateline durring inseason the fishing season This would help enforcment to cover such a large ocean and give much needed scientific data as to the movment and harvesting of the Albacore tuna We have eager fishermen axious to enter the fishery but have little to no resourses to take a risk on loosing the season For example 130000000 USD per vessel per season would sufice That would be around 90000000 USD per year for 3 chartered vessels This would be a great benefit to all by having extra set of eyes and ears to help curb IUU fishing and give our sustainable fishery a boost back into production As it is now We have the most sustainable tuna fishery in the world deemed by MSC that once thrived in the WCPFA dead as a doornail or dieing on the vine South Pacific Please WCPFC we are in dire need of your help We are made up of many nations We have fishermen captains crew from USA Canada New Zealand Cook Islands American Western Samoa Viet Nam China Fiji Tahiti Phillapines and south American too We are not governed by one nation but at the mercie of all nations As it is not to the benafit of one but for the benafit to all Please protect us Enforce the law of the sea Thank you for your consideration and action regarding this matter Sincerely OFAD Pacific Albacore Trollers Captain John Harder infoOceanfadorg

WCPFC15-2018-OP20,5,Observer Statement North Pacific Fisheries Commission NPFC By DaeYeon Moon Executive Secretary
WCPFC15-2018-OP20,6,Good morning Ms Rhea MossChristian Chair of WCPFC Mr Feleti Teo Executive Director distinguished delegates observers and ladies and gentlemen
WCPFC15-2018-OP20,7,On behalf of the North Pacific Fisheries Commission I would like to extend our sincere appreciation to members of WCPFC and the Executive Director for inviting the North Pacific Fisheries Commission to attend the 15th Regular Session of WCPFC as an observer
WCPFC15-2018-OP20,8,As some participants may recall I used to be a regular member to the Scientific Committee meetings and sometimes to the Commission meeting of WCPFC as part of Korean delegation since the beginning of the negotiation period back in 1994 and until 2008 So I am very happy to come back and it is a great pleasure to be here with my old friends and colleagues
WCPFC15-2018-OP20,9,Since this is the first time for the NPFC to attend the WCPFC meeting please allow me to present a brief introduction of our organization to the participants The North Pacific Fisheries Commission was established by the Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fisheries Resources in the North Pacific Ocean which entered into force on 19 July 2015
WCPFC15-2018-OP20,10,The Convention objective is to ensure the longterm conservation and sustainable use of the fisheries resources in the Convention Area CA while protecting the marine ecosystems of the North Pacific Ocean in which these resources occur Currently we have the following Members Canada China Japan Korea Russia Chinese Taipei USA and Vanuatu Our mandated fisheries resources include all marine species caught by fishing vessels within the CA in accordance with Article 1 paragraph h of our Convention which by the way excludes the species already covered by preexisting international fisheries management instruments
WCPFC15-2018-OP20,11,Although we are only in our fourth year we have the basic conservation and management measures to commence our management exercise namely Vessel Registration IUU vessel listing transshipment procedures procedures to address vessels without nationality measures for the management of bottom fisheries and protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems limitation on fishing effort for Pacific saury and chub mackerel and high seas boarding and inspection procedures
WCPFC15-2018-OP20,12,In addition we have established a data management system developing a regional VMS begun stock assessments of our priority species developed a NPFC IUU vessel list for 2017 and 2018 are preparing to launch HSBI in early next year and are progressing on the implementation of various compliance tools
WCPFC15-2018-OP20,13,Cooperation with relevant international organizations is part of our mandate according to our Convention and promoted by our Members We are already establishing formal linkages of cooperation with NPAFC and PICES and following on from the direction of our Members we are working with FAO UN and other organizations including civil society to enhance our science and compliance capabilities
WCPFC15-2018-OP20,14,We know that WCPFC with its 20 years of exemplary management experience can greatly assist NPFC in its development and we look forward to more formal discussions for cooperation that will be mutually beneficial for both Commissions to deter and eliminate IUU fishing in our overlapping convention areas
WCPFC15-2018-OP20,15,As you are well aware IUU fishing has become one of the key issues for RFMOs to address and NPFC Members were very concerned at what they perceived as a high level of IUU fishing in the NPFC Convention area and took an aggressive stance on this matter by endorsing the first IUU fishing vessel list in 2017 In this regard we look forward to taking advantage of the vast experience of WCPFC as we build our compliance system and to establishing such linkages in the very near future
WCPFC15-2018-OP20,16,Taking this opportunity I wish to express our sincere thanks to Executive Director for accepting one of our Staff to the WCPFC Secretariat for shortterm training to learn its advanced operation system I would like to thank him for providing the services of Sam Taufao your ICT Manager to assist us in establishing our data management system and compliance scheme
WCPFC15-2018-OP20,17,I would like to invite representatives of the WCPFC to participate in our 5th Annual Meetings of the Commission which will take place in Japan during 1118 July 2019 During the meetings our Members will discuss cooperation with other organizations consequently we look forward to a representative from the WCPFC to assist us to facilitate such future cooperation
WCPFC15-2018-OP20,18,Finally I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the USA for hosting this meeting at a beautiful city of Honolulu as well as for the great hospitality Thank you very much

WCPFC15-2018-OP21,3,PROPOSAL FOR DEFINING SPECIESSPECIFIC MANAGEMENT MEASURES FOR COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT MIGRATORY LARGE PELAGIC FISH STOCKS IN THE WESTERN AND CENTRAL PACIFIC OCEAN
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,4,To The Attending Representatives of Commission Member States Cooperating NonMember States Participating Territories and Observers to the Fifteenth Regular Session of the Commission for Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPFC15
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,5,From List of Signatories Appendix 1
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,6,December 3 2018
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,7,Dear representatives to the WCPFC15
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,8,The undersigned representatives of seafood industry businesses involved with large pelagic fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean want to highlight the need to reinforce the recognized excellent work that the commission is already doing by suggesting the adoption of further conservation measures related to species other than tuna that are also highly migratory and of great commercial value and importance such as swordfish Xiphias gladius and mahi mahi Coryphaena hippurus Proposal regarding Swordfish
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,9,In August 2018 WCPFC released a new Stock Assessment for Swordfish Xiphias gladius in the Western and Central North Pacific Ocean through 2016 WCPFCSC14 SAWP07 Rev 1 11 August 2018 In the section titled Abstract on page 1 of this document it is stated that Overall the base case model indicated that the WCNPO swordfish stock is not likely overfished and is not likely experiencing overfishing relative to MSYbased or 20 of unfished biomassbased reference points This is undoubtedly very good news
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,10,It is also noted on page 2 and 3 of this document under Status of Stock that the Western and Central North Pacific Ocean WCNPO swordfish population biomass age1 and older averaged roughly 98000 mt between 19741978 the first 5 years of the assessment time frame and has declined only 20 to about 72000 mt in 2016 which reveals an modest exploitation rate
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,11,In the outcomes document the Scientific Working Group has suggested some biological reference points and the agenda for the WCPFC15 put on the table a discussion about a harvest strategy for this species We congratulate the Commission for this as globally recognized good management practices strongly recommend having target and limit reference points and harvest control rules This is also important for getting a practical approach to ecosystembased management
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,12,With swordfish under the scope of the WCPFC and having an accepted stock assessment for this stock we respectfully propose to discuss how to advance further to have the aforementioned tools in place and operative as soon as possible
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,13,Such measures will also greatly contribute to what has been established in Paragraph 7 of WCPFC CMM 20093 Recognizing the need for both InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATCC and WCPFC to adopt conservation and management measures to provide for the sustainable management of swordfish stocks across the Pacific Ocean
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,14,Proposal regarding Mahi Mahi
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,15,Currently WCPFC does not require mahi mahi mahi catch data from Member States Cooperating Nonmember States or Participating Territories and has not provided any species or stockspecific management measures for this species
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,16,However WCPFC Resolution 2005 03 notes the importance of many nontarget fish species such as mahi mahi rainbow runner and wahoo for sustainable livelihoods in many communities in the Convention Area
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,17,Further in the introduction section to WCPFCSC22006EB WP1 Ecological Risk Assessment for species caught in WCPO tuna fisheries Inherent risk as determined by ProductivitySusceptibility Analysis it is stated that There is a general acceptance that highly migratory species UNCLOS Annex 1 are the primary group of species that the WCPO Convention and Commission have been designed to manage Mahi is one of these species and was included in the PSA in WCPFCSC22006EB WP1 where it was assessed as having a moderate to moderately high ecological risk
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,18,While mahi is an important bycatch species for the industrial tuna fisheries in the area of the convention it is an undervalued species for many small scale fisheries in South East Asia
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,19,With all of this in mind the undersigned ask the Commission to i make binding the catch reporting for mahi from Members and Cooperating Nonmembers with immediate effect and ii task the Scientific Committee to plan stock assessment work for this species with the goal of completion within the next three years and iii to define minimum management measures based on the PSA results of WCPFCSC22006EB WP1 while waiting for the results of the future stock assessment
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,20,Improving the management of this species will help protect these fisheries against potential overexploitation in the future It will also help provide the benefits of well managed and internationally recognized sustainable swordfish and mahi fisheries to fishing communities throughout the WCNPO especially those depending on small scale fisheries
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,21,These measures are also an increasing requirement of the markets where these products are sold so adopting them aside from the benefits to conservation will also help maintain the value chain and the great number of livelihoods depending on them For small scale mahi fisheries reaching the best sustainable standards for management can be a powerful tool to gain new markets and therefore to improve the incomes of thousands of fishers their families and their communities
WCPFC15-2018-OP21,22,Sincerely

WCPFC15-2018-OP22,5,WTPO Statement WCPFC 15
WCPFC15-2018-OP22,6,The World Tuna Purse seine Organization WTPO extends its sincere appreciation to the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC for the opportunity given to attend the 15th Regular Session as an observer representing the purse seine vessel owner members and cooperating nonmembers including vessel owners which are SIDS flagged and SIDS based vessels We are bound to cooperate and support the management measures in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPO fisheries management authority
WCPFC15-2018-OP22,7,WTPO reinforces its position statements made in the WCPFC13 in Fiji and WCPFC14 in Manila for the commission to consider and adopt a more specific comprehensive and enforceable FAD definition
WCPFC15-2018-OP22,8,WTPO believes that it is time to consider the adoption of a new FAD definition based on measures such as buoys with active electronic instrument for tracking the nonentangling and less entangling types of FADs the continuing learning of observer on board and vessel operator in resolving arguments and misunderstanding and recent scientific research and recommended use of biodegradable and environment friendly FADs
WCPFC15-2018-OP22,9,The recommended definition as follows
WCPFC15-2018-OP22,10,FishAggregating Device FAD means anchored drifting floating or submerged objects deployed andor tracked by vessels including through the use of radio andor satellite buoys for the purpose of aggregating target tuna species for purseseine fishing operations
WCPFC15-2018-OP22,11,This will result in improved management and understanding with other RFMOs in all oceans of the world
WCPFC15-2018-OP22,12,While we understand the scientific basis to classify a FAD or nonFAD set the current arrangement has caused uncertainties in predetermining a set which can lead to a legal issue and penalty The proposed definition should clearly indicate the intent preceding the set

WCPFC16-2019-OP01,3,Submitted by International Seafood Sustainability Foundation ISSF issfoundationorg Page 1 6 Tuna Conservation What are the issues Effective management measures consistent with advice from the WCPFC Scientific Committee are needed to maintain bigeye yellowfin and skipjack tuna fishing mortality and biomass at sustainable levels Why are we concerned While all target tuna stocks except bluefin remain classified as healthy WCPO CMMs must articulate how and when prescribed management measures apply WCPFC measures should apply to all sources of mortality and be enforceable The 2019 skipjack stock assessment indicates that although the stock remains healthy spawning biomass is at a historical low while fishing mortality on both adults and juveniles continues to increase SC15 noted that the spawning biomass trajectory shows a longterm decline with the stock below the interim Target Reference Point TRP for the last decade SC15 highlighted the need for management to ensure that the stock fluctuates around the TRP What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do Adopt a harvest control rule for skipjack that will ensure that the stock fluctuates around the Target Reference Point Position Statement 201904 Published October 24 2019 WESTERN AND CENTRAL PACIFIC FISHERIES COMMISSION WCPFC MEETING DECEMBER 511 2019
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,4,Our Top Asks for WCPFC in 2019 Adopt a harvest control rule for skipjack that will ensure that the stock fluctuates around the Target Reference Point Require 100 observer coverage for longline vessels and all vessels engaged in atsea transshipment within five years Adopt sciencebased measures for FAD limits FAD marking and tracking and a timeframe for fully nonentangling FADs and biodegradable materials Complete the review of the transshipment CMM and adopt amendments to address significant gaps in its effectiveness Require sharks be landed with fins attached prohibit intentional setting on mobulid rays and adopt a rebuilding plan for oceanic whitetip sharks Adopt audit points and accelerate reforms to the CMS including to provide for observer participation ISSF Position Statement 2019 Page 2 6
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,5,Fish Aggregating Devices FADs
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,6,What are the issues In the WCPFC FAD sets account for about 30 of tropical tuna catches Comprehensive fleet data on FAD deployments and usage are required to effectively manage the tropical tuna purse seine fishery Currently deployed FADs should be lower entangling and be moving towards fully nonentangling using biodegradable materials to mitigate ecosystem impacts
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,7,Why are we concerned Tracking data analyses from FAD buoys is valuable for estimating active FADs and determining FAD fates Recent studies estimate that over 30000 FADs are deployed each year in the WCPO of which about half drift out of main fishing areas and end up beached in PNA waters1 Given the high risk of FAD ecosystem impacts including beaching marine debris and cryptic shark and turtle mortality it is essential to collect and report FAD data including the number of FADs being deployed and FAD position data and trajectories to develop sciencebased management measures Effective FAD marking mechanisms also are critical
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,8,What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do WCPFC needs to develop a comprehensive FAD management program that achieves the following 1 Add a new FAD Information section and FAD identification field in the ROP Minimum Standard Data Fields for inventories of FAD buoys on board at the start and end of each trip and adopt requirements for improved reporting on FADs by vessel operators such as those developed by the PNA 2 Set a timeframe to transition to FADs without nets and with biodegradable materials 3 Require fleets to remove previously deployed highly entangling FADs from the water 4 Design FADrecovery mechanisms and incentives such as increasing purse seiners FAD retrieval and
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,9,storing capacity and removing a percentage of FADs from the water relative to the number deployed 5 Adopt sciencebased limits on FAD deployments andor FAD sets 6 Require complete FAD position data and acoustic records from echosounder buoys 7 Adopt supplyandtender vessel measures including identifying purse seine vessels supported data collection on FADs being deployed and serviced identifying on the Record of Fishing Vessels which activities they are engaged in and applying observer requirements
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,10,8 Develop a FAD marking scheme based on the FAO Guidelines on the Marking of Fishing Gear for all new FAD

WCPFC16-2019-OP01,12,Harvest Strategies
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,13,What are the issues Harvest Strategies which include target and limit reference points together with harvest control rules provide preagreed rules for managing fisheries resources and acting on stock status changes
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,14,WCPFC SC15 2019MIWP12 Escalle et al Nature httpsdoiorg101038s41598019503640 ISSF Position Statement 2019 Page 3 6
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,15,Why are we concerned The timeframes in the original agreed Harvest Strategy Work Plan have lapsed WCPFC needs to urgently develop species specific harvest strategies The 2019 assessment of skipjack indicates that biomass has been below the target level TRP for a decade and this needs to be addressed by management through a Harvest Control Rule The Scientific Committee has reiterated the need for a dedicated ScienceManagement Dialogue process to support harvest strategy development Also all MSCcertified WCPFC fisheries must meet the Commissions harvest strategy development timeframes in the amended Harvest Strategy Work Plan in 2017 or risk losing their certification
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,16,What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Develop harvest control rules for south Pacific albacore and skipjack and agree on a target reference point for yellowfin and bigeye tunas as in the Harvest Strategy Work Plan 2 Establish a ScienceManagement Dialogue by adopting the Terms of Reference proposed by the Scientific Committee
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,17,Bycatch and Sharks
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,18,What are the issues Strong management measures and bycatchmitigation actions are necessary to maximize vulnerable species postrelease survival in both purse seine and longline fisheries Sciencebased conservation and management measures to limit fishing mortality on sharks and rays and data collection and reporting requirements are also essential Why are we concerned The WCPFC has not adopted rigorous management arrangements for shark fisheries or mobulid rays and the CMMs for minimizing shark bycatch do not reflect scientific advice or best practices SC15 concluded that the oceanic whitetip shark stock was overfished and subject to overfishing with the greatest impact from bycatch in longline fisheries Clearly the retention prohibition in CMM 201104 has been insufficient to end overfishing of this vulnerable stock Proven bycatch mitigation methods such as removing wire traces are not mandatory in all longline fisheries SC15 also noted that an evaluation of the 5 fins to carcass ratio is not currently possible due to insufficient or inconclusive information and there is still no mechanism for generating the data necessary to review the ratio What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Adopt a comprehensive CMM for sharks which includes i Mandatory use of scientifically proven shark mitigation measures by longline fishing vessels together with high observer
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,19,coverage needed to assess compliance For oceanic whitetip sharks explore additional ways to reduce catches
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,20,eg via closed hot spots ii Requiring sharks be landed with fins still naturally attached iii Requiring that sharks to which noretention prohibitions apply and unwanted sharks be hauled alongside the vessel before being cut free to facilitate species identification iv A prohibition on the intentional setting on and retention of mobulid rays 2 Amend and expand CMM 201803 on seabirds to apply to all longline fisheries south of 25 South 3 Develop harvest strategies and recovery plans for all overfished shark species

WCPFC16-2019-OP01,24,What are the issues Comprehensive observer coverage is critical to effective fisheries management compliance monitoring and independent verification of catch effort and species interactions eg sharks sea turtles and whale sharks
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,25,Why are we concerned Many CCMs do not meet the minimum 5 observer coverage requirement for longline vessels adopted in 2007 12 years ago The paucity of longline fishery data hinders both scientific assessment and management recommendations Although there is a 100 observer coverage requirement for purse seine vessels between 20N and 20S information presented at SC15 revealed the actual coverage is about 85
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,26,What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,27,1 Require 100 observer coverage human andor electronic for longline vessels and all vessels engaged in atsea
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,28,transshipment within five years 2 Adopt best practice emonitoring and ereporting standards including for logbooks for longline and purse seine vessels

WCPFC16-2019-OP01,31,Why are we concerned
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,32,Reports presented at TCC15 show the number of reported high seas transshipment events has increased by 155 between and 2018 This includes an increase of 29 between 2017 and 2018 The Secretariat also reported that CCMs are not
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,33,meeting their reporting obligations WCPFC must address the deficiencies and loopholes in CMM 200906 to ensure complete
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,34,data collection and timely reporting and to combat IUU fishing ISSF analyzed the transshipment management
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,35,arrangements in multiple RFMOs and recommends best practice amendments to the WCPFC CMM
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,36,What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do 1 Ensure the review of the effectiveness of CMM 200906 is completed and amendments to the transshipment presented to the Commission in 2020 2 Adopt best practice amendments to CMM 200906 to i Require real time or as close to near realtime reporting for all transshipment activity ii Require CCMs to report on atsea transshipment conducted inside EEZs iii Extend the transshipment management arrangements to bunkering vessels iv Automatically include in the draft IUU vessel list any vessels that breach the transshipment CMM v Adopt clear criteria for flag State authorization of atsea transshipment and a process for the Commission to review issued authorizations against those criteria
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,37,ISSF Position Statement 2019 Page 5 6 Compliance
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,38,What are the issues A strong compliance process improves fisheries management by holding members accountable for their implementation of agreed measures The WCPFC has a work plan for strengthening the Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS including the development of audit points a riskbased framework and a scheme of responses to noncompliance
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,39,Why are we concerned CCMs assessing their own compliance behind closed doors with little to no transparency is not consistent with best practice The WCPFC is the only tuna RFMO that has a compliance assessment process that is closed to accredited observers The WCPFC needs to accelerate the completion of the outstanding items in the work plan in CMM 201807 including enabling accredited observers to participate in the CMS process and developing of a scheme of responses to noncompliance ISSF analysed the compliance assessment processes in multiple RFMOs and recommends best practices for the continued refinement of WCPFC CMS
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,40,What is ISSF asking WCPFC to do
WCPFC16-2019-OP01,41,1 Adopt the audit points for the initially identified obligations in 2019 and finalize audit points for the remaining obligations in 2020 2 Progress as a matter of urgency the remaining items identified in the CMM 201807 work plan through the Intersessional CMS Working Group including allowing accredited observers to attend CMS working group meetings 3 Disclose CCMs plans to address identified areas of noncompliance

WCPFC16-2019-OP05,5,Introduction The World Wide Fund for Nature WWF would like to again thank the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC for the opportunity to attend the 15th Regular Session as an observer and to address the critically important role that it plays in the proper management of the Western Central Pacific Ocean WCPO fisheries WWF once again calls on members of the WCPFC to address the issues and recommendations raised at SC15 NC15 TCC15 and WCPFC15 as well as observe the experience of other RFMOs in their own efforts to achieve and maintain improved measures for monitoring and surveillance WWF would like to note that this Position Statement is not comprehensive but that fact does not mean that WWF does not believe that other issues are not important WWF wishes to reiterate its position offered in Honolulu Hawaii in December 2018 WCPFC15 and taking into account the WCPFCrelated meetings held since the recommendations listed below as well as other documents submitted to the WCPFC for review as Observer Papers Reference Points Harvest Control Rules and Harvest Strategies WWF remains supportive of the work of the WCPFC and subsidiary bodies in pursuing the implementation of a Harvest Strategy HS approach as agreed under CMM 201406 and Supplementary Information on Workplan workplan for the adoption of Harvest Strategies Consistent with previous WWF position statements and recommendations WWF continues to encourage WCPFC16 to further endorse and support the adoption of explicit Limit and Target Reference Points LRPTRP Harvest Control Rules HCRs and HSs for all WCPO fishery stocks Gregg Yan WWF
WCPFC16-2019-OP05,6,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 16th Regular Session Port Moresby Papua New Guinea 511 December 2019 WCPFC16 under WCPFC authority WWF further notes that the original agreed timelines have lapsed and there is now an urgent need to establish species specific harvest strategies consistent with the workplan WWF requests the WCPFC observe the importance of and strong support for these important management measures specifically the adoption of TRPs and HCRs for the key target species particularly from industry participants with Marine Stewardship Council MSC certification and many end markets Therefore WWF encourages WCPFC16 to maintain momentum on implementation of HS elements and where necessary take steps to recover timelines under the workplan WWF recommends that the WCPFC Support and endorse further implementation of CMM 201406 on Establishing a Harvest Strategy for Key Tuna Species in the WCPO consistent with proposed timelines Establish precautionary TRPs for bigeye BET and yellowfin YFT Adopt an HCR for the skipjack SKJ purse seine PS fishery and the South Pacific albacore SP ALB longline LL fishery that fluctuates around the established respective TRPs and Endorse the continued development and implementation of LRPs and TRPs for proper management of all stocks including sharks as a priority Sharks and Rays Sharks and Rays continue to make up a large percentage of annual bycatch1 with many shark species in the WCPO remaining subject to high levels of fishing mortality that current stock assessment trends suggest is unsustainable2 Furthermore WWF is increasingly concerned with shark conservation and sustainability in the WCPFC region as a whole and considers responsible management trade and consumption where shark mortality occurs in all fishing activities not just in circumstances where tuna fishing is occurring Therefore WCPFC must also recognise the needs of coastal States in the WCPFC region to manage their shark populations WWF is extremely disappointed by the failure of the Intersessional Working Group to develop agreed recommendations for a Comprehensive Shark CMM in 2018 Greater urgency toward shark conservation is required in the face of declining shark populations as evidenced by both the shortfin and longfin mako sharks being upgraded to Endangered globally in March this year and the perilous state of the oceanic whitetip shark in the WCPO SC15 concluded that the oceanic whitetip shark stock remains overfished and subject to overfishing and faces possible extinction despite the prohibition on retention reflecting poorly on WCPFCs current approaches to preventing the overfishing of sharks Therefore WWF urges WCPFC16 to prioritize finalizing a Comprehensive Shark CMM that ensures key shark and ray species including those prioritized by the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species CITES are effectively managed3 WWF continues to support recommendations within the proposed CMM to include methods to eliminate finning and incorporate language to encourage CCMs to land sharks with their fins naturally attached to their bodies as well as supporting recommendations4 Equally urgent is the need to introduce additional management measures as part of a recovery plan for the oceanic whitetip shark which include addressing catch data quality issues that have arisen due to the prohibition on retention While WWF supports the action of the WCPFC to adopt the Best Handling Practices For The Safe Release Of Sharks Other Than Whale Sharks And MantasMobulids we further recommend that additional requirements and procedures are necessary for nonretained shark species including provisions to ensure species ID and removal of trailing gear WWF also again asks the WCPFC16 to consider a prohibition to setting on or retention of manta rays genus Mobula and Manta and

WCPFC16-2019-OP05,8,WWF Position support associated best practices for safe handling and release aboard purse seiners consistent with previous action by the IATTC WWF recommends the WCPFC Adopt a Comprehensive Shark CMM that includes a new framework incorporating existing CMMs but also providing for national contributions toward commonly agreed goals for shark stocks including o Mandate bycatch best practices consistent with those found in the Compendium of Best Practice of Conservation and Management Measures CMMs for the of Species Bycatch in Tuna RFMOs o Establish Fins Naturally Attached FNA as the most effective means to address shark finning in the WCPO consistent with the best available science o Implement the recommendations for bycatch that were endorsed at Kobe III and adopt an annually updated report card system against these recommendations for all of the WCPFC fisheries o Require through data collected from observer programs and other means estimation of the number of captures and releases of all sharks and rays including the status upon release dead or alive and reporting of this information to the WCPFC o Amends CMM 201405 to prohibit vessels carrying wire trace and the use of wire trace branch lines o Require through observer programs recording what gear is used in longline activities including the use of wire traces and any multi monofilament traces in order to avoid biteoff by sharks and o Enact recovery plans for the most depleted species Take steps to introduce a recovery plan for the oceanic whitetip shark in the near term Adopt the Draft Guidelines for Best Handling Practices for the Safe Release of Mantas and Mobulids Adopt a retention prohibition for bigeye thresher shark as the previous assessment indicates that management action is necessary for this vulnerable species Encourage the development of harvest strategies including associated reference points and control rules for all shark and ray species as envisaged under Articles 5 and 10 of the WCPF Convention and Encourage CCMs to develop NPOAs with measures to report all shark and ray catches from domestic fleets operating in territorial and archipelagic waters to assist CCMs to meet obligations for shark and ray species incorporated under CITES Appendix II including making any nondetriment finding publicly available Regional Observer Programme It is unquestionable that information collected as part of a successful observer programme is critically important to the proper conservation and management of a fishery Data collected by observers plays a central role in informing fisheries scientists and managers on everything ranging from stock assessments to nontarget species impacts5 Furthermore observers play an indispensable role in
WCPFC16-2019-OP05,9,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 16th Regular Session Port Moresby Papua New Guinea 511 December 2019 WCPFC16 monitoring and documenting compliance with very important CMMs in the WCPO6 Therefore the WCPFC must consider securing appropriate observer coverage a top priority All CCMs agreed to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPF Convention text and other Commission obligations to ensure the best scientific information or evidence available is used in WCPFC decisions7 By its plain reading this obligation not only requires CCMs to actively seek out and use the best available scientific evidence but also compels CCMs to ensure that measures taken result in the generation of the best available scientific evidence8 Any other interpretation would be absurd Therefore the WCPFC is obligated under the WCPF Convention to put data collection processes in place that secure the production and use of the best available scientific evidence in the WCPFC decision making process Observer Safety and Security WWF again commends the WCPFCs previous actions to address issues with observer safety and security through the adoption of the observer safety and security provisions as well as the flag and coastal state requirements However WWF continues to strongly believe that more needs to be done to fully address observer safety and security WWF remains concerned with reports that some CCMs are still not meeting their obligations to provide observers with the required safety and security equipment It has been more than two years since CCMs agreed CMM 201703 Conservation and Management Measure for the Protection of WCPFC Regional Observer Programme Observers so the requirements must be met posthaste Additionally WWF maintains that there is a need for a full and transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents One of the outstanding gaps in observer safety and security is represented by the lack of information available to address observer incidents through proper followup and documentation A requirement for full and transparent reporting will allow for identification and understanding of potentially dangerous situations for future observers across all RFMOs Until the WCPFC can fully understand the circumstances surrounding these incidents it cannot hope to properly address them The ROP Annual Report as it currently exists does not provide the necessary level of detail to properly address these issues Thus WWF recommends establishing a required comprehensive and transparent reporting procedure for observers and observer programmes to report instances of threats harassment intimidation assault or death that national programmes and the ROP could then use to determine solutions to prevent future instances and share that information with other RFMOs This procedure must include an annual publicly available consolidated detailed and fully transparent report of all infractions against observers Calculation of Observer Coverage Metric Over 12 years ago the WCPFC established CMM 200701 which specified that fisheries observer coverage is to be 5 of effort in each nonpurse seine fishery under the jurisdiction of the Commission and shall be achieved no later than 30 June 20129 Specifically low observer coverage in the longline fishery was identified as a significant conservation risk As indicated by the discussion at that time as well as discussion among CCMs at WCPFC forums since the arbitrary benchmark established at 5 was considered a starting point for a stepwise progression toward appropriate observer coverage Not only has achieving the principal objective of CMM 200701 proven difficult but even measuring how it is achieved remains unsettled At the moment CCMs self report their longline observer coverage under four separate metrics including10 Days at Sea days observer is at sea compared to number of days fleet is at sea Number of Trips number of observer trips compared to trips by the fleet Days Fished observed fishing days compared to fleets fishing days and

WCPFC16-2019-OP05,11,WWF Position Number of Hooks number of hooks observed compared to fleet hooks used Because these metrics are each calculated differently and subject to different biases it places an undue burden on the scientific service provider to standardise data in such a way as to properly assess coverage First it forces the scientific service provider and ultimately the WCPFC to compare apples with oranges in a way that frustrates efficient analysis and ultimately timely and proper management Second by using a metric that is more susceptible measurement error bias and estimation error it leads to greater uncertainty and the problem of garbage in garbage out that leads to management failures Moreover because of the biases of the different metrics it creates inequity among CCMs that places more of the conservation burden on those using a more accurate and precise metric that is less susceptible to bias and manipulation The best available scientific information suggests that number of hooks represents the best method for achieving multiple objectives including effectively calculating effort and accurately assessing rare events like seabird interactions11 Furthermore three CCMs are currently assessing their observer coverage based on number of hooks hence it is practically feasible Consequently WWF recommends that the WCPFC confirm number of hooks as the best practice metric for all CCMs calculating observer coverage on longline vessels and mandate a 5year time frame to shift to use of this metric If other metrics for calculating coverage are used in the transition toward number of hooks the WCPFC should clearly define terms in advance and CCMs must calculate and report each metric in a way that is comparable to and consistent with number of hooks Level of Observer Coverage Recent efforts by the scientific service provider to standardise observer coverage data indicate that regionwide observer coverage could be at or slightly above 512 However the best available scientific evidence indicates that even a consistently applied level of 5 coverage is statistically and practically useless to effectively achieve most management13 or compliance objectives14 Low observer coverage exacerbates bias as a result of fishers altering their fishing practices eg discarding practices handling and release practices effort and gear when an observer is present which is a phenomenon known as the observer effect15 The higher the observer coverage rate the lower the bias from an observer effect is as the larger the proportion of fishing effort that is observed the more accurately the monitoring data characterize or represent the fishery Notwithstanding the observer effect at just 5 current observer coverage is neither producing the quality nor quantity of data necessary to adequately manage fisheries under WCPFC authority At present a lack of sufficient data that is typically generated through adequate observer coverage represents the single largest obstacle to establishing appropriate management measures Uncertainty is continually cited in the WCPFC process as a reason for inaction while the improved certainty offered by better observer coverage is consistently rejected In fact at the recent 15th Meeting of the Scientific Committee SC15 one member stated that they could not accept any requirement for observer coverage greater than 5 WWF concedes that different minimum levels of observer coverage may be appropriate for different management or compliance purposes depending on specific identified objectives However data collected under less than 100 coverage may be biased and misrepresent the fishery overall resulting in potential management failures Alternatively 100 observer coverage through human or electronic observers would result in no bias from an observer effect Thus along with a consortium of other NGOs and with the support of prominent market partners we have determined that because of conservation and compliance problems such as illegal fishing misreported or unreported catch and bycatch of endangered threatened and protected species that only an observer coverage rate of no less than 100 through human or electronic observers is acceptable16 By continuing to fail to secure a scientifically or statistically valid level of observer coverage on longline vessels the WCPFC fails to meet the charge of the WCPF Convention to generate and use the best available scientific information Therefore the WCPFC must take action to improve observer coverage across all longline vessels operating in the WCPFC Convention Area
WCPFC16-2019-OP05,12,WWF Position Statement to the WCPFC 16th Regular Session Port Moresby Papua New Guinea 511 December 2019 WCPFC16 WWF recommends the WCPFC Ensure the requirements of CMM 201703 have been met Endorse further observer safety and security measures including fully transparent documentation and catalogue of observer incidents and entities involved Endorse the calculation of observer coverage on the basis of number of hooks as best practice and mandate a transition to calculation of observer coverage based on number of hooks by 2025 and Establish a plan to increase observer coverage by human observers or electronic monitoring across all longline vessels operating in the WCPFC Convention Area on an annual basis to achieve 100 coverage by 2025 Transhipment Monitoring Transhipment remains one of the most prominent weaknesses in catch documentation and verification that leads to Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU catch in the WCPO WWF notes that the most simple efficient and effective solution to the challenges of transhipmentrelated IUU is to simply prohibit all atsea transhipment and require all fishing vessels to either tranship or land their catch at the nearest available designated port in the WCPO following the conclusion of fishing activity However acknowledging that a prohibition on transhipment is politically unlikely at this time WWF supports the establishment of the Transhipment Intersessional Working Group and associated review and revision of CMM 200906 to address deficiencies in the current measure Some CCMs remain consistently noncompliant with CMM 200906 Reports presented at TCC15 indicate that the number of reported high seas transhipment events increased 155 between 2014 and with an increase of 29 between 2017 and 2018 These CCMs also continue to fail to meet their reporting obligations Therefore given the high risk of transhipment to facilitate IUU fishing and the ongoing noncompliance associated with the practice the WCPFC must urgently address the deficiencies in CMM 200906 WWF recommends the WCPFC Implement real time or near realtime reporting requirements for all components of transhipments including electronic verification and validation tools Review and revise CMM 200906 including replacing the impracticability test and unfettered flag State authorization with clear criteria and a process for the WCPFC to review issued flag State authorizations against those criteria to ensure compliance Include bunkering vessels in transhipment management arrangements and Consider automatically including any vessel that breaches transhipment regulations on the draft IUU vessel list

WCPFC16-2019-OP08,1,COMMISSION SIXTEENTH REGULAR SESSION Port Moresby Papua New Guinea 11 December 2019 ACAP STATEMENT ON REDUCING SEABIRD BYCATCH IN PELAGIC LONGLINE FISHERIES WCPFC162019OP08 November 2019
WCPFC16-2019-OP08,2,Submitted by Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels1
WCPFC16-2019-OP08,3,Abstract
WCPFC16-2019-OP08,4,The incidental mortality of seabirds in pelagic longline fisheries continues to be a serious global concern especially for threatened albatrosses and petrels The need for international cooperation in addressing this concern was a major reason for establishing the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels ACAP httpsacapaq ACAP presented a background paper WCPFCSC152019EBIP03 to the meeting of the Fifteenth WCPFC Scientific Committee in August 2019 in which we provided an update on ACAPs advice on mitigation of seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries The paper summarised updated ACAP advice on mitigation and identified new areas of focus to address the continuing conservation crisis facing albatrosses and petrels and the need for urgent and increased efforts to counter this crisis This paper reiterates for the WCPFC Commission the main points made in that paper including ACAPs continuing emphasis on exploring with our colleagues in Regional Fisheries Management Organizations and others ways to work together more effectively to reduce bycatch of albatrosses and petrels in fishing operations and improve the conservation status of these threatened seabirds

WCPFC16-2019-OP08,6,Introduction and background The incidental mortality of seabirds in pelagic longline fisheries continues to be a serious global concern especially for threatened albatrosses and petrels The need for international cooperation in addressing this concern was a major reason for establishing the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels ACAP There have been significant efforts internationally to develop mitigation measures to avoid or minimise the risk of incidental catch of seabirds in longline fisheries Although most mitigation measures are broadly applicable the application and specifications of some will vary with local methods and gear configurations ACAP routinely reviews the scientific literature dealing with seabird bycatch mitigation in pelagic longline fisheries ACAP recognises that factors such as safety practicality and the characteristics of the fishery should also be taken into account when considering the efficacy of seabird bycatch mitigation measures and consequently in the development of advice and guidelines on best practice The most recent review was conducted in May 2019 at the Ninth Meeting of the ACAP Seabird Bycatch Working Group with the recommendations of the review adopted by the Eleventh Meeting of its Advisory Committee Paper WCPFCSC152019EBIP03 provided details of ACAPs updated advice
WCPFC16-2019-OP08,7,The main outcomes of the 2019 ACAP meetings In the first two weeks of May 2019 ACAP held in Florianpolis Brazil the 11th meeting of its Advisory Committee preceded by meetings of its Working Groups on Seabird Bycatch and on Population and Conservation Status These meetings discussed priorities for ACAPs work programme including its engagement with RFMOs a key element of ACAPs work The reports from these the meetings are available on the ACAP website th meeting of ACAPs Advisory Committee AC11 Ninth meeting of ACAPs Seabird Bycatch Working Group SBWG9 Fifth meeting of ACAPs Population and Conservation Status Working Group PaCSWG5
WCPFC16-2019-OP08,8,ACAPs advice for reducing the impact of pelagic longline fisheries on seabirds was reviewed and updated at the 2019 meetings The updates were relatively minor and the current version of ACAPs advice is available on the ACAP website
WCPFC16-2019-OP08,9,ACAP has developed and adopted new advice on improving safety when hauling branchlines during pelagic fishing operations which can be downloaded from the ACAP website Also available on the ACAP website are guidelines for removing fishing hooks from bycaught birds Additional information on safe handling and release guidelines for seabirds is provided in WCPFCSC152019EBWP10 As noted in EBWP10 intersessional work is underway to develop safe handling and release guidelines for birds entangled in nets This will be relevant to capture of live birds in purse seine nets ACAP continues to update the ACAPBirdLife bycatch mitigation fact sheets and an updated Seabird Bycatch Identification Guide will also be available soon
WCPFC16-2019-OP08,10,The 2019 ACAP meetings highlighted the urgency of addressing the conservation crisis that continues to be faced by albatrosses and petrels with fisheries bycatch remaining a primary threat ACAPs efforts to counter this crisis will involve a change of focus in some cases and taking advantage of ongoing innovations in for example technology Some of these efforts will be relevant to ACAPs interaction with RFMOs such as the WCPFC since the only way to tackle the crisis is by working together
WCPFC16-2019-OP08,11,Some of the particular concerns and points of discussion by ACAP Parties in relation to seabird bycatch and its mitigation include the following Disappointment that despite all the research and attention devoted to the development of best practice bycatch mitigation measures these have not been used sufficiently extensively to stop the decline in the numbers of many albatross and petrel species The meeting considered it sufficiently important to spend considerable time discussing why there had been insufficient uptake of best practice or even implementation of required bycatch mitigation measures The discussion acknowledged that many RFMOs and national authorities have put in place at least some measures to reduce seabird bycatch but that compliance and enforcement were often inadequate ACAP is now giving a greater focus to working with others to identify ways of strengthening compliance with conservation measures adopted Compliance with required seabird bycatch mitigation measures is an area that needs much greater attention ACAP is keen to assist where it can to contribute ideas on how to improve monitoring and compliance including through the development of innovative methods We are encouraged by the fact that within jurisdictions where enforcement has occurred reductions in seabird bycatch were demonstrated sometimes dramatically so and without the perceived detrimental consequences arising This is a clear indication that the crisis can be successfully addressed
WCPFC16-2019-OP08,12,One of our immediate objectives is to communicate urgently the message that albatrosses and petrels are in a dire conservation state and that urgent action is required to improve their status We also want to give greater emphasis to success stories to convey the message that through cooperation and sharing our experience we can work together to solve the conservation crisis
WCPFC16-2019-OP08,13,The WCPFC has recognised the need to reduce seabird bycatch and recently adopted WCPFC Conservation and Management Measure to mitigate the impact of fishing for highly migratory fish stocks on seabirds CMM 201803 Arguably the single most important action to reduce bycatch is to increase compliance in the proper use of existing seabird bycatch regulations such as WCPFC CMM 201803
WCPFC16-2019-OP08,14,World Albatross Day to be celebrated for the first time on 19 June 2020 will be one opportunity to highlight the efforts being made and the immediacy of making sure they succeed

WCPFC16-2019-OP09,2,COMMISSION SIXTEENTH REGULAR SESSION Port Moresby Papua New Guinea 11 December 2019 A CHECKLIST FOR FISHERIES MANAGEMENT IN THE WESTERN AND CENTRAL PACIFIC WCPFC162019OP09 November 2019
WCPFC16-2019-OP09,3,Submitted by The Pew Charitable Trusts A Checklist for Fisheries Management in the Western and Central Pacific Managers must conserve tunas and sharks reform transshipment and end illegal fishing Nov 2019 Brief Overview The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission WCPFC is responsible for the longterm conservation and management of highly migratory fish stocks including tunas and sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean The Pew Charitable Trusts calls on the Commission to fulfil this responsibility by taking the following actions at its 16th annual meeting from 511 December in Port Moresby Papua New Guinea Ken JonesGetty Advance the creation of harvest strategies to support sustainable fisheries WCPFC has made considerable progress in developing harvest strategies for tunas in accordance with conservation and management measure CMM 201406 and its harvest strategy workplan At this meeting the Commission should q Adopt terms of reference for creating a Harvest Strategy Development Working Group to facilitate interaction between scientists managers and other parties q Dedicate adequate funding to advance the management strategy evaluation MSE processes for skipjack South Pacific albacore yellowfin and bigeye tunas q Provide feedback on the initial results of the skipjack MSE including candidate harvest control rules q Adopt interim target reference points TRPs for bigeye and yellowfin tunas at their current levels of biomass until the necessary data and analyses are available to factor in socioeconomic objectives Setting TRPs at current biomass levels would achieve the objectives of CMM 201801 to prevent biomass decline q Require at least a 70 per cent chance of meeting these interim TRPs to ensure that the populations achieve them more often than not q Adopt a CMM to reduce fishing mortality of South Pacific albacore to make progress towards achieving the TRP q Adopt the Northern Committees NC15 recommendation to develop a harvest strategy for north Pacific swordfish but recommend using an MSE to assess the performance of potential harvest strategies Reject catch increases for Pacific bluefin tuna and support progress on a precautionary harvest strategy Pacific bluefin tuna remains severely depleted and urgent action is required to end overfishing and develop a precautionary longterm harvest strategy that uses an MSE At its 2019 meeting NC15 took a step forward by recommending terms of reference for the MSE process and candidate harvest strategy elements for testing in the MSE Unfortunately NC15 also proposed additional exemptions to the current management measure that loosen restrictions on quota transfers and carryforwards effectively increasing the catch allowed in 2020 and threatening to delay rebuilding of the stock This is too risky because there is only a 3 per cent chance that the rebuilding plan will be successful if recruitment is assumed to stay low Effective management is based on setting sustainable quotas that consider uncertainty surrounding current and future conditions The Commission should q Reject NC15s recommendation to add exemptions to the management measure which would increase catches of Pacific bluefin q Recommend that NC15 include in the terms of reference a workplan to complete the MSE in 2024 and implement a precautionary harvest strategy in 2025 It should include testing the rebuilding strategy q Recommend that NC15 amend the proposed harvest strategy elements to include more precautionary reference points for evaluation including FSPR50 as a target and 30SSBF0 as a threshold reference point which would provide a greater buffer from the limit reference point Adopt measures that support the recovery of oceanic whitetip sharks CMM 201104 banned the retention of oceanic whitetip sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean Fishing mortality of this species has been reduced but it is still too highestimated at twice its maximum sustainable yield Spawning biomass has been reduced to just 4 per cent of unfished biomass The 2019 stock assessment concluded that there is a substantial risk that oceanic whitetip sharks will become extinct if the level of fishing mortality continues The Scientific Committee SC15 this year recommended more efforts to mitigate catch and improve safe handling and release practices Prohibiting the use of wire leaders and shark lines would cut fishingrelated mortality2 Better safehandling techniques such as cutting the trailing gear as close to the hook as possible and keeping the shark in the water alongside the vessel are also needed to further reduce mortality Furthermore SC15 urged that observer coverage on longline vessels be increased to improve data collection for longline fisheries The WCPFC should q Adopt more measures to reduce oceanic whitetip shark mortality such as prohibiting wire leaders and shark lines and improving safehandling techniques q Increase observer coverage to improve data collection Strengthen protections on vulnerable manta and mobula rays Caught as bycatch by longline and purse seine vessels in the western and central Pacific Ocean six species of manta and mobula rays are vulnerable to overfishing and the Commission has added them to the list of key shark species for assessment To reduce mortality and encourage live release the Commission has adopted guidelines for best handling practices for mobulids By listing these species on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and Appendix I and II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals the global community has expressed its concern for their status regulating the trade and take respectively The Commission should q Prohibit the retention of manta and mobula rays caught in the Convention area and require that vessels follow the WCPFCs safe handling guidelines to facilitate live release wildestanimalGetty Strengthen port State measures to fight illegal unreported and unregulated IUU fishing Port control and inspection measures are a costeffective way to prevent IUU catch from entering the market A recent study supported by The Pew Charitable Trusts found that 10 WCPFC States fall in the top quarter of those most at risk of having illegally caught fish pass through their ports3 While the WCPFC adopted a set of voluntary port State minimum standards CMM 201702 in 2017 they must be strengthened to meet internationally recognized standards and best practices adopted by other regional fisheries management organizations RFMOs CMM 201702 encourages Commission members cooperating members and nonmembers CCMs to designate ports for inspection of foreign vessels and establishes inspection and informationsharing procedures However only five of almost 40 port CCMs have designated ports and contact points and the WCPFC has received no reports of resulting port inspections This year the Technical and Compliance Committee TCC15 reviewed a proposal by Canada to revise the measure to require prior notification from vessels wishing to use ports allow for denial of entry into port or use of port with denials to be reported to the WCPFC Secretariat require inspections of vessels previously denied access to port and specify a format for reporting port inspections These provisions would bring the WCPFC one step closer to the standard in the UN Food and Agriculture Organizations Port State Measures Agreement other RFMOs stricter port State measures and the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency Regional Port State Measures Framework The WCPFC should q Urge port States to designate ports for inspection of foreign vessels to improve implementation of the port State measures adopted by the WCPFC q Adopt improved minimum standards for port State measures in line with Canadas proposal to the TCC15 Encourage States to obtain IMO numbers for vessels to improve oversight of fishing International Maritime Organization vessel identification numbers IMO numbers are another essential tool in the fight against IUU fishing because they improve monitoring control and surveillance of fishing operations In 2018 the Commission adopted CMM 201806 which requires IMO numbers for all motorized inboard fishing vessels from less than 100 gross registered tons GRT down to 12 meters long that are authorized to fish in the Convention area beyond flag States areas of national jurisdiction The requirement takes effect 1 April 2020 so flag States should use the next few months to ensure that they will be in compliance The Commission should q Reiterate that flag States must obtain IMO numbers for all eligible vessels authorized to operate within the Convention area and submit this information to the WCPFC Improve transshipment regulations to ensure legal and verifiable seafood supply chains Transshipment at sea in the western and central Pacific Ocean continues to provide opportunities for unscrupulous operators to avoid proper catch reporting and launder IUU catch A Pew report found that transshipment management in WCPFC is compromised by a lack of reporting noncompliance with reporting requirements and nonstandardized reporting responses by CCMs in their Annual Report Part I submissions The number of reported high seas transshipment events rose more than 155 per cent between 2014 552 events and 2018 1409 eventsthe highest number reported in the Convention area with a 29 per cent increase between 2017 and 20184 The regulatory framework requires significant strengthening standardization and harmonization regardless of whether current reporting requirements are being met The WCPFC should q Ensure that the intersessional working group has enough resources and support to carry out the analysis identified in section 5a of its terms of reference and encourage all CCMs to fully participate in its work Adam BaskeThe Pew Charitable Trusts Adopt minimum standards for electronic monitoring and move towards 100 per cent observer coverage CMMs do not require sufficient and timely submission or verification of critical fishing data which contributes to ineffective management of the tuna longline fisheries in the Convention area Electronic monitoring EM technology has been proved to be a costeffective option to expand observer coverage without placing additional personnel onboard Last year the Commission agreed to prioritize EM in areas in which independent data collection and verification is low Subsequently Project 93 reviewed how EM could address data gaps within the Commission In an initial assessment it found that the biggest data gaps exist where observer coverage is low particularly in longline fisheries and suggested that electronic monitoring can significantly improve compliance and data verification for these vessels EM is particularly valuable for target species caught under catch limits without 100 per cent observer coverage The Commission should q Prioritize the development and adoption of the necessary standards and infrastructure needed to successfully implement electronic reporting and monitoring q Require 100 per cent observer coverage for all longline operations through a mix of human observers and electronic systems Strengthen the compliance monitoring scheme CMS to improve its effectiveness A robust CMS can help the Commission fulfil its obligations under the WCPFC Convention and is essential to achieving sustainable fisheries WCPFCs CMS allows States to identify areas in which they need help to improve compliance But it lacks penalties to deter noncompliance and does not permit civil society observers to attend meetings during which compliance reports are reviewed A strengthened CMS would help the Commission verify that flag States are meeting their obligations level the playing field for the fishing industry and ensure that conservation measures are not undermined Last year the WCPFC adopted a new CMS that includes a list of outstanding tasks The Commission should make progress on those tasks to ensure that it fully and transparently supports the WCPFCs objectives It should q Mandate that flag States provide the information that would allow the WCPFC to verify that they are fulfilling their obligations and resolve allegations of noncompliance q Create penalties for serious or persistent noncompliance q Permit observer organizations to be present at compliance discussions in accordance with the WCPFC Conventions language on transparency Article 21 Endnotes Regarding reference points FSPR50 is the fishing mortality rate that would allow the stock to attain 50 per cent of the maximum spawning potential in the absence of fishing while 30SSBF0 refers to 30 percent of the spawning biomass expected had there been an absence of fishing S Harley et al Monte Carlo Simulation Modelling of Possible Measures to

WCPFC16-2019-OP11,21,Continue progress of harvest strategies for all major tuna stocks to ensure
WCPFC16-2019-OP11,22,sustainability while also recognizing the social and economic dependence of coastal
WCPFC16-2019-OP11,23,communities on fisheries harvesting shared tuna stocks To this end we expressly
WCPFC16-2019-OP11,24,encourage the adoption of harvest strategies with equitable reference points and
WCPFC16-2019-OP11,25,control rules for all target tuna stocks Strengthen the management of tropical tunas in line with advice from the
WCPFC16-2019-OP11,26,Scientific Committee SC to avoid overfishing and secure continued opportunities for
WCPFC16-2019-OP11,27,onebyone fisheries eg pole and line handline and troll coastal fisheries and

WCPFC16-2019-OP12,5,Observer Statement North Pacific Fisheries Commission NPFC By DaeYeon Moon Executive Secretary
WCPFC16-2019-OP12,6,Good morning Ms Riley Kim Chair of WCPFC Mr Feleti Teo Executive Director distinguished delegates observers and ladies and gentlemen
WCPFC16-2019-OP12,7,On behalf of the North Pacific Fisheries Commission I would like to extend our sincere appreciation to members of WCPFC and the Executive Director for inviting the North Pacific Fisheries Commission to attend the 16th Regular Session of WCPFC as an observer
WCPFC16-2019-OP12,8,As stated through an observer statement at the annual meeting of WCPFC held in Hawaii cooperation with relevant international organizations is one of our mandates in accordance with our Convention and accordingly we as a relatively young RFMO have made linkages with a number of organizations since commencement in 2015 including formal cooperation arrangements with NPAFC and PICES with a view to exchanging information and collaborating in matters of common interest
WCPFC16-2019-OP12,9,Continuing from last year I would like to stress the importance of cooperation between WCPFC and NPFC which share responsibilities for the management of fisheries resources in a large part of the North Pacific Ocean NPFC has set a priority for cooperation with organizations having overlapping jurisdiction with that of NPFC hence the development of a formal tie with WCPFC has been supported by the NPFC Commission To move this initiative forward the Secretariats of both organizations have continued communication and agreed that an MOU arrangement would facilitate cooperation between the two organizations
WCPFC16-2019-OP12,10,The areas of collaboration could be broad encompassing compliance science as well as operational aspects with the first of these as one of the areas of mutual concern that we believe should be addressed urgently We recognize the considerable experience that WCPFC has in monitoring vessel activity on the high seas and in some of its Members EEZs As RFMOs with overlapping Convention Areas we both share the global concern with respect to stopping the IUU fishing in our respective areas and as such we realize the benefits of cooperation on compliance issues Such collaboration provides us with an excellent opportunity to demonstrate to other RFMOs the benefits of sharing information on activities of vessels of interest to either or both RFMOs NPFC Members have stated their intent to take an aggressive stance to address the high levels of IUU fishing in the global oceans and therefore wish to initially focus on links with our neighboring RFMOs with overlapping jurisdictions We know we can learn a considerable amount from your experience and wish to create formal links for sharing of information and possibly joint operations in the overlapping areas As an example NPFC notes that several fish carrier vessels are cross authorized to operate in both the NPFC and WCPFC Convention Areas thus providing an excellent opportunity to jointly monitor transshipments this being one of the major gaps in fisheries compliance today When successful this would be an excellent example of cooperative efforts and success in deterring and eliminating IUU fishing in the Northern Central and Western Pacific Ocean
WCPFC16-2019-OP12,11,We also can benefit from scientific cooperation with WCPFC having many years of experience of using diverse scientific methods to address not only target species but also nontarget associated and dependent species Potential areas of scientific cooperation include collecting sharing and analyzing data of common interest to both Commissions exchange of data and information and collaboration on research relating to stocks and ecosystems of the North Pacific Methods and best practices of data collection and setting up observer programs is another promising area for cooperation between the organizations Since both RFMOs are sharing the North Pacific as the common Convention Area to a large extent the exchange of scientific information gathered by each side and sharing of information on fishing activities could minimize duplication in efforts and costs to cover such a wide area as the North Pacific
WCPFC16-2019-OP12,12,Taking this opportunity I would like to express our sincere thanks to Mr Teo and his team of the WCPFC Secretariat for their efforts and contribution to the progress in this initiative which we have made so far and look forward to continued discussions for a formal MOU between NPFC and WCPFC within the next year To facilitate this process I would like to invite representatives of the WCPFC to participate in our 6th Annual Meetings of the Commission which will take place in Japan during 1522 June 2020
WCPFC16-2019-OP12,13,Finally let me thank the government of Papua New Guinea for hosting this meeting at the beautiful city of Port Moresby as well as for the great hospitality and I wish you every success in this important meeting
WCPFC16-2019-OP12,14,Thank you very much

WCPFC16-2019-OP16,2,Submitted by WWF
WCPFC16-2019-OP16,3,Background
WCPFC16-2019-OP16,4,The decisions made by the 16th Regular Session of the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPFC16 will not only influence the future of tuna and other highly migratory fish stocks and associated species in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean WCPO but will directly shape the future of people and communities working in and derive their livelihood from the fishery The outcomes of the WCPFC16 deliberations must continue progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in particular SDG 14 Conserve and sustainably use the oceans seas and marine resources and its specific targets including but not limited to marine pollution regulating harvesting ending overfishing Illegal Unreported and Unregulated fishing IUU and destructive fishing practices implementing sciencebased management plans prohibiting certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing eliminating subsidies that contribute to IUU fishing and increasing the economic benefits to Small Island Developing States SIDS and Least Developed Countries LDCs from the sustainable use of marine resources In addition the WCPFC16 must also progress the goals of the Pacific Regional Roadmap for Sustainable Pacific Fisheries including improving overall sustainability for the four key tuna species safeguarding food security value employment opportunities and safety of those working in the fishery and associated industries A resilient and sustainable tuna fishery also contributes to safeguarding and enhancing the resilience of the Pacific Islands region to the impacts of climate change JOINT STATEMENT DECEMBER JOINT CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS CSO STATEMENT TO THE 16TH REGULAR SESSION OF THE COMMISSION FOR THE CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH STOCKS IN THE WESTERN AND CENTRAL PACIFIC OCEAN WCPFC
WCPFC16-2019-OP16,5,JOINT CSO STATEMENT TO WCPFC16 WWF submits this joint position statement on behalf of the undersigned CSOs that participate in the WCPFC consultation process or may seek to participate in future The legitimacy and importance of public participation in multilateral environmental agreements including fisheries is broadly recognised as international best practice and mandated for in a range of international instruments and agreements In relation to fisheries this participation has been codified in the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement UNFSA Representatives of Pacificbased CSOs were consulted on upcoming issues at WCPFC16 CSOs representatives included the Pacific Islands Association of NonGovernment Organisation PIANGO Pacific Dialogue Limited PDL Pacific Island Tuna Industry Association PITIA Pacific Network on Globalisation PANG and World Wide Fund for Nature WWF The safety and basic human rights of fishing crew marine pollution transparency and accountability of the Commission were highlighted as concerns by the CSO representatives without losing sight of the importance of the sustainability of the WCPOs tuna resource The sustainability and economic viability of this fishery is of particular importance for those Pacific Small Island Developing States PSIDS members of the Commission that depend on the fishery for their livelihoods and economic opportunities
WCPFC16-2019-OP16,6,ISSUES RECOMMENDATIONS CSO representatives agreed that some of their concerns raised at previous sessions of the Commission have not been sufficiently addressed As such the following issues have been identified as of primary importance to be considered by WCPFC16 We note with concern that the adoption of harvest strategy work plans for the key species has continuously been delayed which may impact PSIDS that have invested in ecolabelling certification We support and reiterate calls from fisheries industry participants with ecolabelling certification sustainable conscious actors and consumers along the tuna supply chain to support harvest strategy development and adoption We believe this step should be taken while these stocks are in a

WCPFC16-2019-OP16,8,JOINT CSO STATEMENT TO WCPFC16 generally healthy biological state The lack of effective management in the WCPO and in particular the high seas is threatening the long term sustainability of key tuna stocks Recommendation Urgently establish Harvest Strategies for all tuna species since the agreed timeframe according to the Harvest Strategy workplan CMM201406 has lapsed In particular establish target reference points TRPs for Yellowfin and Bigeye tunas that will accomplish objectives to ensure the longterm sustainability productivity and social benefits of the fishery Limited WCPFC Observer participation and the need for greater transparency in all related Commission meetings including all related sessions to ensure accountability and openness in the management of our tuna resource We acknowledge the work that has been taken to develop guidelines for participation of Observers in closed meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies which consider the compliance monitoring report but note the lack of agreement over its adoption Recommendation Improve transparency of the WCPFC proceedings to ensure consistency with Article 21 of the WCPF Convention The Commission should consider the following a Allow WCPFC Observers access to all sessions of the WCPFC including matters relating to Compliance and urge members to adopt the draft guidelines allowing for the participation of Observers in closed meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies which consider the compliance monitoring report b Review participation fees for WCPFC Observers Fees should be set at a level to encourage participation of CSOs from WCPFC SIDS members
WCPFC16-2019-OP16,9,JOINT CSO STATEMENT TO WCPFC16 The need for greater observer coverage in the longline fishery to ensure the accuracy and adequacy of data enhances the Commissions ability to effectively manage the tuna fishery sustainably Limited observer coverage limits the ability to monitor compliance with conservation and management measures Recommendation Increase the number of fisheries observers onboard longline fishing vessels operating within the Commissions jurisdiction to ensure improved catch data reporting and compliance with regulations Furthermore CCMs must continue to facilitate the uptake of Electronic Monitoring Systems EMS along with standards that are consistent and compatible in use and practice particularly on the high seas to complement the work of fisheries observers as a means to ensure full observer coverage on all longline fishing vessels is achieved Controlling high seas catch effort capacity and associated activities in particular atsea transhipments Recommendation We recommend prohibiting atsea transhipments particularly on the high seas given the challenges of effectively monitoring transhipments on the high seas and recommend that transhipments take place in port CCMs must also take the necessary steps to implement CMM 201702 Conservation and Management Measure on Minimum Standards for Port State Measures in order to strengthen efforts to combat IUU fishing We encourage CCMs to conduct more port inspections particularly on vessels suspected of being involved in IUU fishing activities

WCPFC16-2019-OP16,11,JOINT CSO STATEMENT TO WCPFC16 The use of FADs and the impacts to coastal communities and smallscale fisheries and fishers is not fully known Recommendation We recommend that impacts of FADs to coastal communities and small scale fisheries and fishers must be taken into consideration in deliberations on FAD management We acknowledge the adoption of the Resolution 201801 on Labour Standards for Crew on Fishing Vessels however we note that the Resolution is nonbinding We also note that certain markets are moving towards ensuring that social accountability standards in fisheries supply chains are met Ecolabelling certification entities are now requiring social accountability standards to complement environmental standards in response to market demands The safe working conditions and wellbeing of fishing crew and of fisheries observers is paramount Recommendation Implement binding measures that ensures safe and decent working conditions of fishing crew on fishing vessels operating in the Convention Area in line with FFAs Harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions on Human Rights and Labour Conditions for Crew that will come into effect on January 1st 2020 IMOs Cape Town Agreement on Fishing Vessels Safety and ILOs Work in Fishing Convention 2007 C188 Although CMM 201703 Conservation and Management Measure for the protection of WCPFC Regional Observer Programme Observers has been adopted the challenge lies in its implementation The mandatory documentation and reporting of incidences concerning observer safety and wellbeing is nonexistent which undermines the Commissions ability to effectively address the issue
WCPFC16-2019-OP16,12,JOINT CSO STATEMENT TO WCPFC16 Recommendation Improve requirements and avenues for reporting of incidents involving crew and observer safety and wellbeing to ensure accountability transparency and to inform future management of this issue Impacts on the wider oceanic environment of marine pollution from fishing vessels in particular discarded and abandoned fishing gear disposal of plastic waste and oil pollution into the ocean The current measure in place does not effectively address compulsory compliance by CCMs Recommendation CCMs should take the necessary steps to implement CMM 201704 Conservation and Management Measure on Marine Pollution in particular prohibiting the discharging of any plastics and we call for further action to prohibit the deliberate abandonment of fishing gear currently not covered under CMM 201704
WCPFC16-2019-OP16,13,Although mindful that trade matters are not the mandate of the Commission we call on World Trade Organization WTO Members of the WCPFC to ensure that any outcome on fisheries subsidies negotiations deliver on adequate and effective special and differential treatment as per SDG 146 This is in recognition of the need for disproportionate burden upon those WTO members whose subsidised fleets have historically overfished waters and as such must undertake the highest level of commitments Disciplining subsidies for largescale vessels fishing outside of the subsidising nations jurisdiction will mean that those most responsible for overcapacity will be targeted first The sovereignty of all coastal nations especially small island developing states as currently enshrined in UNCLOS must not be weakened by proposed WTO disciplines Any outcome within the WTO must not undermine the processes competencies or jurisdiction of national authorities and RFMOs such as the WCPFC when it comes to making determinations regarding IUU fishing or assessing stock levels

WCPFC16-2019-OP16,15,JOINT CSO STATEMENT TO WCPFC16 The special requirements of developing countries as enshrined in legally and non legally binding international fisheries agreements including UNFSA must be reflected in any outcome Further the provision of adequate technical and financial assistance for the implementation of any commitments must be conditioned upon the level of disciplines undertaken by WTO members Any agreed disciplines should not create disguised restrictions to trade for developing countries
WCPFC16-2019-OP16,16,Conclusion We wish to emphasize that the concern about the sustainability of the fishery and the safety and security of fishing crew and observers is shared by the undersigned in solidarity We are hopeful that the outcomes of the WCPFC16 will take these recommendations into consideration The following organisations hereby endorse this joint statement

WCPFC16-2019-OP17,9,The International Game Fish Association IGFA is a nonprofit organization that represents recreational anglers throughout the world IGFA was established in 1939 has active members in over 100 countries and provides rules for ethical angling practices Many of the IGFAs members target the highly migratory species managed by WCPFC especially marlin sailfish and spearfish ie billfish which are primarily caught and released
WCPFC16-2019-OP17,10,IGFA has great concern about how highly migratory species are being managed on a global level for recreational anglers The lack of data and accurate reporting on billfish catch is of particular concern As an organization that is committed to the conservation of game fishes IGFA has deployed over 400 popup satellite archival tags in marlin around the world in the past eight years many of which have been in the area under this organizations purview The information gained from this exercise is available to your scientific committee
WCPFC16-2019-OP17,11,Billfish
WCPFC16-2019-OP17,12,North Pacific Striped Marlin The IGFAs primary concern for the 16th Regular Session of the Commission continues to be the status of striped marlin According to the last stock assessment 2019 the WCNPO stock has experienced a long term decline in population biomass and the stock is currently overfished and experiencing overfishing The spawning stock biomass is estimated at just 981 t and the biomass of age 1 and older fish is 6000 t Taken collectively the current spawning stock biomass is 76 below that necessary to achieve MSY and fishing mortality is 7 higher than that would achieve MSY As such the stock continues to be both overfished and experiencing overfishing and no reference points have been established by the WCPFC Additionally there is concern regarding the low shortterm recruitment that the stock experienced between 2016
WCPFC16-2019-OP17,13,Because of the severely depleted nature of the stock and uncertainty regarding if it will continue experiencing low recruitment the IGFA recommends that the WCPFC reduce total catch to no more than 1359 t in order to achieve a 60 probability of attaining a spawning stock biomass of 3610 t by
WCPFC16-2019-OP17,14,Southwest Pacific Striped Marlin The most current information for southwest Pacific striped marlin indicates that the stock is overfished and very close to experiencing overfishing This stocks spawning biomass has been depleted to less than 20 of its unfished condition even though recent catches are roughly half of the MSY for the stock
WCPFC16-2019-OP17,15,The IGFA recommends that the WCPFC heed the recommendations of SC15 and enact measures reduce the overall catch of the stock including the expansion of the geographical scope of CMM04 to cover the distribution range of the stock
WCPFC16-2019-OP17,16,General Recommendations Although primarily a commercial bycatch species billfish are highly soughtafter recreational species that are primarily caught and released Recreational fisheries for billfish also yield significant economic benefits at the regional level As such the IGFA recommends that all countries be required to report dead discards and use circle hooks in their longline fisheries to reduce fishing mortality and improve the survival of released fish

WCPFC16-2019-OP18,3,December 2019 ATTN Heads of Delegation to IOTC IATTC ICCAT and WCPFC Dear Delegates Building on the Global Advocacy Appeal submitted to tuna RFMOs in 2018 this letter is submitted on behalf of the undersigned companies nongovernmental organizations and fishing industry associations all of whom recognize that the sustainability of tuna stocks is integral to businesses and livelihoods as well as to the health of the marine environment Your government serves as an important leader in tuna stock sustainability as a member of one or more of the four regional fisheries management organizations RFMOs charged with managing the worlds tropical tuna fisheries We are writing to bring to your attention our collective views on several issues crucial to the longterm sustainability of tuna stocks The development and implementation of comprehensive precautionary harvest strategies Effective monitoring and management of fish aggregating devices FADs Strengthened monitoring control and surveillance tools including increased observer coverage in purse seine and longline fisheries and of atsea transshipment activity through human observers andor electronic monitoring Greater focus on implementation of bycatch mitigation actions with an emphasis on longline fisheries We recognize that some tuna RFMOs have made progress on several of these issues and we applaud those actions However we wish to underscore that while the progress todate is positive accelerated actions must be taken at this years RFMO meetings to Develop and implement comprehensive precautionary harvest strategies with specific timelines for all tuna stocks including the adoption and implementation of target and limit reference points harvest control rules monitoring strategies operational objectives performance indicators management strategy evaluation and appropriate tools to achieve exploitation levels Increase compliance with mandatory minimum 5 longline observer coverage rates by identifying and sanctioning noncompliance Adopt and implement a 100 observer coverage requirement human andor electronic within five years for longline and purse seine fisheries where not already required Adopt and implement a 100 observer coverage requirement human andor electronic for atsea transshipment activities as well as other measures as defined in the Best Practices for WellManaged AtSea Transshipment document developed through the NGO Tuna Forum that ensure transshipment activity is transparent and wellmanaged and that all required data is fully collected and sent to the appropriate bodies in a timely manner Require the use of the bestavailable observer safety equipment communications and procedures on fishing and transshipment vessels Develop and implement sciencebased recommendations for the effective management of FADs as defined in the Best Practices for WellManaged FAD Fisheries document developed through the NGO Tuna Forum and integrate FADbased information into stock assessments to reduce uncertainties Implement adopted measures for the use of nonentangling FAD designs as a precautionary measure to minimize the entanglement of sharks and other nontarget species and transition to the use of biodegradable materials to mitigate marine debris More effectively implement and ensure compliance with existing RFMO bycatch requirements and take additional mitigation action such as improving monitoring at sea collecting and sharing operationallevel speciesspecific data and adopting stronger compliance measures including consequences for noncompliance for all gear types We believe these measures will positively impact the longterm sustainability of tuna stocks and the overall health of the marine ecosystem The companies that have signed this letter represent major seafood buyers that source seafood products from a diverse international supply network The nongovernmental organizations work in more than 100 countries and engage suppliers and provide advice to retailers buyers and food service companies regarding improvements in tuna sustainability The fishing industry associations represent a variety of gear types including purse seine longline troll pole and line and handline vessels active in tuna fisheries worldwide Collectively we request that your government as a member of one or more of the tuna RFMOs take active steps to ensure significant progress on these issues at each of the relevant RFMO meetings in as a matter of priority Sincerely Gavin van Der Burgh CEO Hugo Byrnes VP of Product
