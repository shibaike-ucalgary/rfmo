"text6206","WCPFC8",296,"dr hampton noted that historically purse seine effort within the high seas pockets represented 14 of managed purse seine effort but that based on logsheet observer and vms data high seas pocket effort has been eliminated however it is likely that much of this effort has been transferred to other areas rather than completely removed from the fishery an exception to this is the catch reduction by the philippines which is likely to be directly attributable to the high seas pocket closures although it is thus not likely that high seas pocket effort was eliminated from the fishery it is worthwhile considering whether total effort would have been even higher if the high seas pockets had remained open","WCPFC8","bycatch"
