WCPFC10,20,The Chair reminded WCPFC10 that decisions regarding applications for CNM status (WCPFC10-2013/08) are to be handled in two distinct steps:  a decision on whether to grant this status and a decision on the participatory rights to be awarded to each CNM.
WCPFC10,21,"The Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC) Chair, Rhea Moss-Christian, summarized the status of the CNM applications.  TCC9 reviewed applications from Belize, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Ecuador, El Salvador, Indonesia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam, and considered that all should be considered by WCPFC10 subject to receipt of the further financial and technical information requested from each applicant.  Some of the applicants provided information on their financial contributions to the Commission but receipt of the full contribution was only confirmed for Belize, Ecuador, El Salvador, Panama and Vietnam.  A contribution from Thailand was received but was slightly short of the full amount requested.  Responses received from Belize, Thailand and Vietnam were made available for CCM review on the Commission’s secure website."
WCPFC10,22,"After some discussion WCPFC10 agreed to conduct discussions on both the decision regarding CNM status and the granting of participatory rights within a small working group (SWG-CNM).  Framework documents for the SWG-CNM were CMM 2009-11 and Secretariat paper WCPFC10-2013/08.  The SWG-CNM proposed draft decision points or report language where possible, with the working group noting that final decisions were to be made by the wider Commission meeting.  Information reviewed included i) TCC9’s recommendations and requests regarding individual CNM applications; ii) information provided by applicants subsequent to TCC9; and iii) information provided during the course of the WCPFC10 SWG-CNM meeting."
WCPFC10,23,"TCC9 recommended that the Commission consider all CNM applications subject to the additional information requested being provided to, and accepted by, the Commission.  The SWG-CNM reiterated that any information requested by TCC should be provided in advance of the regular session of WCPFC, to allow due consideration of this material by CCMs.  Building on a recommendation from TCC9, the SWG-CNM confirmed the need for a CNM application template to be developed, based on CMM 2009-11, that clearly outlines the requirements for CNM applicants.  This was a key discussion point from the SWG-CNM.  A template was considered necessary to assist with clarity in relation to the application process.  Also, some CNMs noted the view that parts of the application process did not directly relate to their participation in the WCPFC.  Some members of the SWG-CNM also raised concerns about consistent application of CMM 2009-11 requirements such as financial contribution.    Granting of CNM Status for 2014"
WCPFC10,24,The SWG-CNM did not consider TCC9’s recommendations in relation to Indonesia given the recent deposit of its instrument of ratification.      6 Belize

WCPFC10,30,No information was received from DPRK that was considered by the SWG-CNM. Information was received by the Secretariat on 3 December 2013 advising that a member of the DPRK delegation is intending to visit WCPFC offices early in 2014 and indicating that a financial contribution for 2012-2014 would then be paid.  The SWG-CNM invited the Commission to consider the DPRK application in light of this.      7
WCPFC10,31,FFA members noted that the DPRK did not provide the requested information nor its assessed contribution for 2013.  These CCMs stated that if the assessed contribution for 2013 is not received it should be accrued and added to the 2014 assessed contribution and any further applications from the DPRK should not be considered unless the full accrued payment is received.
WCPFC10,32,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to the DPRK.    Ecuador

WCPFC10,34,Ecuador was a participant in the SWG-CNM and advised that a formal letter of response had been sent to the Secretariat prior to WCPFC10.  This letter was presented to the SWG-CNM and outlined Ecuador’s position that the information requested from TCC9 was largely included in Ecuador’s original CNM application (to TCC9) or on the vessel register.
WCPFC10,35,"Upon review, the SWG-CNM was satisfied with the information provided by Ecuador and invited the Commission to renew its CNM status for 2014."
WCPFC10,36,FFA members thanked Ecuador for the information provided and for its financial contribution and supported renewal of its CNM status for 2014.
WCPFC10,37,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to Ecuador.    El Salvador

WCPFC10,40,"Upon review, the SWG-CNM was satisfied with the information provided by El Salvador and invited the Commission to renew its CNM status for 2014."
WCPFC10,41,FFA members thanked El Salvador for the information provided and for its financial contribution and supported renewal of its CNM status for 2014.
WCPFC10,42,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to El Salvador.    Mexico
WCPFC10,43,TCC9 requested the Secretariat ask Mexico to provide the following in advance of WCPFC10:    i. explicit commitment to accept high seas boarding and inspections in accordance with the Commission’s procedures on high seas boarding and inspection;  ii. information on names of historical fishing vessels; iii. commitment to provide financial contribution; iv. AR Part II report; v. information on any research programmes conducted in the Convention Area; vi. information on compliance with the provisions of the Convention and the CMMs adopted by the Commission and the fisheries laws and regulations of coastal States in the Convention Area; vii. information on responding to any IUU activities by vessels flying its flag that have been brought to its attention; and viii. information on responses to alleged violations of CMMs adopted by the Commission and any IUU activities of vessels flying its flag.
WCPFC10,44,"Mexico was a participant in the SWG-CNM and advised that it had provided information as part of its original CNM application which addressed some of the TCC9 requests.  Mexico stated it does not have any vessels in the WCPO area and that it continues to have a domestic legal constraint to accepting high seas boarding and inspection, and issues attributing budget for financial contribution, given lack of fishing presence.  Mexico also made a substantial statement to the SWG-CNM outlining their relationship to the WCPFC."
WCPFC10,45,"Upon consideration, and noting the general requirements that apply to all CNMs, the SWG-CNM was satisfied with the explanation and information provided by Mexico and invited the Commission to renew its CNM status for 2014."
WCPFC10,46,FFA members noted that Mexico did not provide its assessed contribution for 2013.  These CCMs stated that if the assessed contribution for 2013 is not received it should be accrued and added to the 2014 assessed contribution and any further applications from Mexico should not be considered unless the full accrued payment is received.  FFA members also questioned why Mexico had made previous commitments to accepting WCPFC high seas boarding and inspection procedures but now maintains that it has domestic legal constraints which prevent this.
WCPFC10,47,"Mexico explained that because it does not fish in the WCPF Convention Area its domestic legal constraints prevent it from obtaining funds to pay its assessed financial contribution.  Furthermore, Mexico considered that because it has no vessels operating in the WCPF Convention Area (including the overlap area) there should be no need for it to agree high seas boarding and inspection procedures, and in fact due to domestic legal interpretations   9 regarding the high seas it would be difficult to do so.  Nevertheless Mexico stated that it remains fully committed to conservation and management of WCPFC fish stocks, particularly Pacific bluefin tuna."
WCPFC10,48,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to Mexico.    Panama
WCPFC10,49,"TCC9 requested the Secretariat ask Panama to provide the following in advance of WCPFC10:  i. commitment to have fishing vessels and nationals comply with provisions of the Convention and CMMs adopted by the Commission; ii. full data on its historical fisheries in the Convention Area, including nominal catches, number/type of vessels, name of fishing vessels, fishing effort and fishing areas; iii. details of current fishing presence in the Convention Area, including the number of its vessels and their characteristics; iv. information on any research programmes conducted in the Convention Area; and v. information on what measures taken to ensure compliance by its vessels with the Commission’s CMMs."
WCPFC10,50,Information was provided by Panama in advance of WCPFC10 which addressed some of the TCC requirements.  Information was also provided during WCPFC10.  The SWG-CNM noted some difficulty linking the information provided by Panama to the specific TCC requests.
WCPFC10,51,"Noting these comments, the SWG-CNM invited the Commission to renew CNM status for Panama in 2014."
WCPFC10,52,FFA members stated their general satisfaction with the application and supported renewal of Panama’s CNM status for 2014.
WCPFC10,53,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to Panama.    Thailand

WCPFC10,55,The SWG-CNM was satisfied with the information provided by Thailand and invited the Commission to renew its CNM status for 2014.      10
WCPFC10,56,"FFA members stated their general satisfaction with the application and supported renewal of Thailand’s CNM status for 2014.  However, the shortfall in payment of Thailand’s assessed contribution for 2013 should be accrued and added to its 2014 assessed contribution."
WCPFC10,57,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to Thailand.    Vietnam
WCPFC10,58,TCC9 requested the Secretariat ask Vietnam to provide the following in advance of WCPFC10:    i. information on any research programmes conducted in the Convention Area; ii. information on record of compliance with the provisions of the Convention and CMMs of the Commission and the fisheries laws and regulations of coastal States in the Convention Area;  iii. information on responding to any IUU activities by vessels flying its flag; iv. information on what  measures taken to ensure compliance by its vessels with the Commission’s CMMs; v. information on responses to alleged violations of CMMs and any IUU activities of vessels flying its flag.
WCPFC10,59,The SWG-CNM was satisfied with the information provided by Vietnam and invited the Commission to renew CNM status for 2014.
WCPFC10,60,"FFA members stated their general satisfaction with the application and supported renewal of Vietnam’s CNM status for 2014.  However, the small transaction shortfall in payment of the assessed contribution for 2013 should be accrued and added to its 2014 assessed contribution."
WCPFC10,61,"One CCM, while supporting the renewal of Vietnam’s CNM status for 2014, called for Vietnam to take responsibility for overseeing shipbuilding activities, such as those underway for 10 large purse seiners, in order to avoid contributing to overcapacity in the region."
WCPFC10,62,Vietnam thanked CCMs for their support of its CNM application.
WCPFC10,63,One CCM stated that as a CNM Vietnam should assist with implementing WCPFC CMMs including those with provisions regarding capacity and fishing effort. The CCM also requested Vietnam to convey to the home government Commission’s concerns for purse seine overcapacity issue in the WCPO. Vietnam agreed with this request.
WCPFC10,64,WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status for 2014 to Vietnam.
WCPFC10,65,"FFA members made a general statement regarding their concern that CNM applicants are not being held to the requirements of CMM 2009-11, in particular that their applications continue to be accepted even if the assessed financial contributions are not paid.  These CCMs indicated that a stricter approach would be adopted when considering future applications from all CNMs.  FFA members also reiterated the request of the SWG-CNM   11 that a template be developed to clearly specify the type of information that should accompany submission of CNM applications.    Participatory Rights"
WCPFC10,66,"The SWG-CNM then considered the issue of participatory rights.  Where a decision to renew status was proposed, the SWG-CNM assessed associated participatory rights with existing rights treated as the starting point for discussion subject to comment from SWG-CNM participants."
WCPFC10,67,"In accordance with the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following limits apply to the participatory rights of Cooperating Non-Members (CNMs) for fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area.  In addition, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under their national jurisdiction or other CCM’s national jurisdiction, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements.  Such CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPF Convention and the WCPFC CMMs.  In addition, CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (RFV).  CCMs shall ensure that CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention.  Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will be conditional on full compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, and all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention.  CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the TCC."
WCPFC10,68,The CNMs identified below provide assurances that they will comply with all requests from Commission Members for information and documentation to investigate cases of possible illegal fishing.
WCPFC10,69,"With respect to the Compliance Monitoring Scheme, the Commission will consider how the Compliance Monitoring Reports of CNMs relate to the consideration of granting CNM status or determining participatory rights during the process of developing responses to non-compliance."
WCPFC10,70,The Commission advised CNMs to ensure that they meet the deadline for submission of applications for CNM status and meet all the obligations contained in CMM 2009-11.  The Commission noted that failure to meet the above requirements could prejudice the future granting or renewal of CNM status.    WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area
WCPFC10,71,"In accordance with the decision of WCPFC9 regarding the management of the overlap area south of 4˚S and between 130˚W and 150˚W, vessels flagged to Belize, Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico will be governed by the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area. Accordingly, the participatory rights for Belize, Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico below apply to the WCPFC Convention Area excluding the overlap area."
WCPFC10,72,"In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the   12 RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for their fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area."
WCPFC10,73,"For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with international and domestic laws, vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area.    Belize"
WCPFC10,74,"WCPFC10 granted Belize the following participatory rights:    i. Belize’s fishing activities in the Convention Area are limited to a longline bigeye catch of 803.25 mt and a longline yellowfin catch of 707 mt. ii. Belize’s fishing activities are further limited to the following: a. Under CMM 2010-05 (or subsequent revision) in accordance with paragraph 1, Belize is limited to historical catch level for 2004 of two unique longliners in the Convention Area south of 20˚S; b. Under CMM 2005-03 Belize is limited to the 2005 level of five unique longliners in the Convention Area north of the equator; and c. Under CMM 2006-04, Belize is limited to two unique longliners in the Convention area south of 15˚S."
WCPFC10,75,The Chair of the SWG-CNM explained that Belize’s limit for longline catch of yellowfin tuna (707 mt) is based on 2001-2004 average catch levels and is consistent with WCPFC10’s discussions of the tropical tuna CMM.    Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
WCPFC10,76,WCPFC10 agreed that the DPRK has no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area.    Ecuador
WCPFC10,77,WCPFC10 agreed that the participatory rights of Ecuador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only.  Ecuador has no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area.    El Salvador
WCPFC10,78,WCPFC10 agreed that the participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only.  The total level of effort by purse seine vessels of El Salvador on the high seas shall not exceed 29 days in the Convention Area.    Mexico
WCPFC10,79,"WCPFC10 agreed that Mexico has participated in the work of the Northern Committee (NC) at NC8 and NC9 and, noting the need for cooperation with the work of the NC particularly in regard to Pacific Bluefin tuna, encouraged Mexico to   13 continue to participate in the NC.  Mexican participation in the WCPO tuna fisheries may not begin until all requested information and commitments have been provided to the WCPFC Secretariat in accordance with the Commission requirements.  The participatory rights of Mexico for fishing in the WCPFC Convention Area are limited to purse seine fishing only.  Mexico has no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area.    Panama"
WCPFC10,80,WCPFC10 agreed that the participatory rights of Panama in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.    Thailand
WCPFC10,81,WCPFC10 noted the need for cooperation between Thailand and the Commission and the commitment from Thailand to provide data from canneries located in Thailand to assist in the work of the Commission.  WCPFC10 agreed to grant CNM status to Thailand for 2014 on the understanding that Thailand will cooperate fully with the Commission in the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data.  The Commission notes the provision of data from Thai canneries and encourages Thailand to continue to cooperate with the Commission to improve the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data.  The participatory rights of Thailand in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.    Vietnam
WCPFC10,82,"WCPFC10 noted the need for continued cooperation between Vietnam and the Commission to achieve compatibility of fisheries management and conservation, as well as on the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data, for which Vietnam would require assistance.  The Commission noted the significant improvements in the collection and provision of data from Vietnam fisheries through the GEF WPEA project, administered by the WCPFC, and encouraged Vietnam to continue to cooperate with the Commission to improve the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data.  The participatory rights of Vietnam in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.    AGENDA  ITEM  3  -  EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CCM REPORTS 3.1 Report of the Executive Director on the Work on the Commission"
WCPFC10,83,"The Executive Director presented his report on the work of the Commission for 2013 (WCPFC10-2013/09).  Highlights included the delivery of all services within budget, the recruitment of ‘Ana Taholo as Assistant Compliance Manager, and maintenance of Commission buildings and establishment of housing for the Executive Director and two members of staff.  Ongoing issues were noted to include:  i) power supply instabilities on the island and ii) the unreliability of United Airlines service which is adding time and expense to staff travel plans.     14 3.2 Statements by CCMs"
WCPFC10,84,The Chair invited WCPFC10 participants to make brief opening statements.
WCPFC10,85,"Tuvalu stated that its fisheries resources are critical to its survival as it has few other natural resources with which to support its people.  Tuvalu is highly dependent on FAD fishing and existing restrictions on FAD fishing (e.g. in the form of the three month FAD closure) cause it to incur a direct economic loss calculated at 1.5 million USD per month.  In this sense Tuvalu feels that additional FAD closures would lead to it bearing an unfair and disproportionate burden for tropical tuna conservation which primarily benefits other, more economically well-off CCMs."
WCPFC10,86,"Samoa noted that it has established an effort limit of 150 days for purse seine fishing in its EEZ under CMM 2012-01, para. 14 (WCPFC10-2013/DP-22).  Samoa noted that it may establish or adjust other limits in the interest of domestic food security, income and employment while maintaining tuna stocks at healthy levels."
WCPFC10,87,"Niue informed WCPFC10 that through a process of full consultation it had set catch limits for South Pacific albacore, yellowfin and bigeye tunas for the longline fishery, and skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tunas for the purse seine fishery under CMM 2012-01, para. 14 (WCPFC10-2013/DP-25).  Niue considers this a milestone in the management of their fisheries."
WCPFC10,88,New Caledonia stated that its priority is to establish a strong framework for the management of South Pacific albacore but that it also wishes to see the Commission’s compliance capabilities strengthened in general.  New Caledonia informed WCPFC10 that it has banned shark fishing and finning and is currently engaged in a review of working conditions for fishermen under the International Labour Organization’s Work in Fishing Convention of 2007.
WCPFC10,89,"Tonga highlighted the importance of ensuring that the Commission’s CMMs result in benefits accruing to small island developing States (SIDS) including the development of their domestic fleets and economies.  While Tonga confirmed that it will continue to fulfil its responsibilities for fisheries management, for example through its recent participation in monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) activities and completion of a National Plan of Action (NPOA)-Sharks, it noted that such activities can strain the capacity of SIDS."
WCPFC10,90,"Greenpeace, the Pew Charitable Trusts, WWF and the International Game Fish Association stated their concern that the WCPFC is not taking appropriate action on issues ranging from the overfishing of bigeye tuna, overcapacity in the South Pacific albacore fishery, lack of management and overfishing for some shark species, high seas transhipment and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.  These observers urged participants in WCPFC10 to avoid stalemates and seek common ground beyond national positions."
WCPFC10,91,The Philippines reaffirmed its commitment to long-term sustainable fisheries as demonstrated by its record of implementing the Commission’s CMMs and cooperating with other CCMs.
WCPFC10,92,"The International Game Fish Association noted that recreational fishing activities are increasing around the world and urged WCPFC10 to i) manage all billfishes to levels   15 above their maximum sustainable yield (MSY) to allow recreational fishing, ii) establish a rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin tuna, and iii) take management action to conserve sharks."
WCPFC10,93,One CCM stated that observers should not be permitted to make opening statements across the floor but should submit such statements in writing.
WCPFC10,94,The Chair noted advice from the WCPFC Legal Advisor regarding the order in which CCMs and observers are offered the floor for opening statements.    3.3 Special Requirements of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and CCM Reports on the Implementation of Article 30 of the Convention
WCPFC10,95,FFA members called for the full recognition of the special requirements of SIDS.  When developed CCMs report on their implementation of Article 30 of the Convention they were requested to i) operationalize Article 30 in all Commission decision-making; ii) target assistance in areas identified in WCPFC10-2013/DP-02; iii) avoid transferring a disproportionate burden as described in WCPFC10-2013/DP-01; and iv) develop criteria to evaluate new proposals in terms of their potential negative impacts on SIDS.  CCMs were asked to integrate these considerations into all the work of the Commission.
WCPFC10,96,"FFA members also noted that when considering the impact of Commission measures on SIDS, the focus should be on three key areas:  i) support increased commercialism of SIDS fisheries; ii) enhance SIDS capacity for conservation and management; and iii) recognise the importance of and implement rights-based management."
WCPFC10,97,"Referring specifically to WCPFC10-2013/DP-02, FFA members identified assistance needs in six key areas:  i) revise CMM 2012-01 to avoid any disproportionate burden; ii) protect and increase SIDS participation in the South Pacific albacore fishery; iii) increase SIDS capacity in the areas of compliance, data analysis/science and bioeconomic analysis, and implementation of the Information Management System (IMS); iv) increase budgets for SIDS participation in meetings, particularly Chairs and Vice-Chairs of subsidiary bodies; v) develop E-reporting, national observer programmes and port sampling for transhipment operations; and vi) rationalise Commission workloads, prioritisation of issues and streamlining agendas."
WCPFC10,98,"FFA members explained that effective participation in meetings of the Commission goes beyond travel funding and requires capacity building for data management, science and compliance.  While those CCMs that have contributed to the Special Requirements Fund and the Japan Trust Fund are appreciated, all CCMs were invited to contribute in these or other ways."
WCPFC10,99,"FFA members also noted two specific priorities for the development of the CMR process.  These include i) observer debriefing and data management, and ii) capacity building for national plans of action, license conditions, VMS obligations and mitigation measures."
WCPFC10,100,"FFA members introduced a proposal for a new CMM containing the principles previously expressed in Resolution 2008-01 (WCPFC10-2013/DP-36 (rev 1)).  The proposed CMM contains sections on capacity development of personnel, technology transfer, fisheries conservation and management, MCS, and support for SIDS’ domestic fishing industries.  The proposal would also require that developed CCMs report against the new CMM in Annual Reports-Part 2.  CCMs were encouraged to support this binding measure in order to   16 avoid a situation in which SIDS are overwhelmed by the rising obligations of the Commission."
WCPFC10,101,"With specific reference to avoiding transfer of a disproportionate burden to SIDS, FFA members noted that two papers (WCPFC10-2013/DP-01 and WCPFC10-2013/DP-33) lay out suggestions for assessing the flows of costs and benefits to SIDS arising from management actions.  These members noted that thus far the onus has been on SIDS to make these assessments themselves and this constitutes a disproportionate burden in and of itself.  Specific criteria to be applied when WCPFC considers a new proposal were presented in WCPFC10-2013/DP-02.  FFA members tabled a proposed CMM requiring these criteria be applied to any WCPFC conservation and management proposal in the form of explanatory note attached to the proposal (WCPFC10-2013/DP-35)."
WCPFC10,102,FFA members expressed a desire to open a two-way dialogue with developed CCMs on these important issues.
WCPFC10,103,One CCM supported the position of FFA members and noted that operationalizing Article 30 requires more than the provision of development assistance.  This CCM considered that recognizing the special requirements of SIDS requires respecting and strengthening coastal States’ rights through more tangible approaches.
WCPFC10,104,"Some CCMs stated that while they acknowledge and respect the intentions contained in the proposals the range of issues covered exceeds the authority of their delegations to comment upon.  Nevertheless, these CCMs expressed a desire to further clarify and consider the contents of the proposals."
WCPFC10,105,WCPFC10 continued discussion of these issues under Agenda Items 11.1.11 and 11.1.12.   3.3.1 CCM Reports on the Implementation of Article 30 of the Convention
WCPFC10,106,"The EU stated that it has allocated $45 million US for the DevFish2, SciCoFish and ACP2 projects, implemented by FFA and SPC, to promote tuna sustainable management and ensure economic benefits (WCPFC10-2013/DP-37).  These projects are inter alia assisting with training of observers, stock assessment and tuna tagging.  In addition to these projects the EU stated its intention to continue supporting relevant new initiatives.    AGENDA  ITEM  4  -  CMM 2013/01 TROPICAL TUNA MEASURE 4.1 Development of a CMM on Tropical Tunas"
WCPFC10,107,The Secretariat tabled a summary of reporting received by WCPFC in accordance with CMM 2012-01 (WCPFC10-2013-10 (rev 6)).
WCPFC10,108,The Chair noted that the pre-WCPFC10 Heads of Delegation (HOD) meeting on the tropical tuna CMM spent considerable time discussing issues and decided it was appropriate to continue the discussions in an informal small group format.
WCPFC10,109,"Japan made a presentation on the struggles of Japan’s small to mid-scale longline fisheries over the past 30 years (WCPFC10-2013/DP-29a).  In overview, there has been a rapid   17 decline in catch, catch value and the number of vessels, and the fishing grounds have shrunk considerably.  Decreasing catches of bigeye and yellowfin have been replaced by albacore, sharks or swordfish, but these catches too are declining.  In one case study, the continued existence of the traditional fishing community is being threatened whereas in another case study the community is suffering from both changes in the fishery and the effects of the tsunami.  Believing that this scenario is not unique to its communities, Japan urged CCMs to take action to halt the expansion of the purse seine fleet and reverse the trends in the bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks.  Particular concern was expressed about information suggesting that Sapmer, a French company based in Singapore, is planning to build ten purse seiners in Vietnam which will fish in the Convention Area to supply the Japanese market."
WCPFC10,110,France stated that it had no information on the activities of this company.
WCPFC10,111,"FFA members expressed their support for the draft tropical tuna CMM prepared by PNA members, Tokelau, Japan and the Philippines (WCPFC10-2013/DP-13 (rev 1)) noting that the priorities for FFA members are to halt overfishing of bigeye tuna, strengthen management for yellowfin and skipjack tuna stocks, and avoid further transfer of effort to the South Pacific albacore stock.  Based on the scientific advice, FFA members called for better FAD management, clearer limits on purse seine fishing, and a reduction in fishing mortality from longline fishing.  FFA members clarified that a reduction of up to 33% in the use of FADs was supported on the basis of scientific advice that this, along with reductions in longline catches, would halt the overfishing of bigeye tuna.  However, the proposed longline bigeye catch limits are considered insufficient to guarantee the desired results, and any further reduction in FAD sets will place a disproportionate burden on SIDS.  FFA members referred to proposed text within the joint draft, and delegation papers that explain this text, which suggest ways of avoiding this disproportionate burden.  In particular, FFA members called for limits on high seas purse seine effort, a high seas FAD closure, a high seas longline closure, a transfer payment fund, and development of zone-based rights throughout both longline and purse seine fisheries."
WCPFC10,112,"With regard to the high seas purse seine effort levels, FFA members stated that these should be based on 2010 levels.  FFA members would prefer that these limits are allocated but in the short term if this is not possible the high seas fishery should be closed when the 2010 limits are reached.  Reverting to baseline levels in CMM 2008-01 is not supported because it is considered i) incompatible with the scientific advice, ii) contrary to the requirement to implement compatible measures in EEZs and the high seas, and iii) would lead to increases in high seas and overall effort."
WCPFC10,113,"PNA members explained that they have made strenuous efforts to propose a practical and effective draft of the tropical tuna measure, noting that FAD closures, high seas pocket closures, 100% observer coverage and full retention of catch were first implemented under the PNA Third Implementing Arrangement.  The importance of avoiding a disproportionate burden was stressed along with the need to properly manage fisheries resources for the sake of PNA members’ economies and communities.  CCMs were encouraged to support the PNA’s joint proposal with Tokelau, Japan and the Philippines or to develop constructive, alternative proposals."
WCPFC10,114,"Japan reminded WCPFC10 that much work was expended on their joint proposal with the PNA, Tokelau and the Philippines and encouraged CCMs to support it.  Japan expressed its   18 agreement with the FFA recommendation to set a baseline for high seas purse seine effort based on 2010 levels."
WCPFC10,115,The USA explained that its proposal (WCPFC10-2013/DP-04) is designed to be fair and follow the scientific advice.  In recognition of the need to constrain fishing capacity the USA has previously made proposals to freeze the capacity of developed CCMs and ensure that transfer of capacity leading to an overall increase does not occur.
WCPFC10,116,"Chinese Taipei noted that it has both purse seine and longline fisheries in the WCPF Convention Area and would like to see a fair balance of measures for both.  However, since the longline fishery has already achieved its reductions, a concomitant reduction in purse seine fisheries appears to be necessary."
WCPFC10,117,"The EU stated that actions to halt overfishing of bigeye tuna are critical and should be taken by all gear types across the region in line with the scientific advice.  The EU considered that the large number of options under discussion made it difficult to consider all the implications, and therefore the number of options should be marrowed.  Clear effort limits for the high seas and review of the measure next year once new bigeye and yellowfin tuna stock assessments are available were supported."
WCPFC10,118,"China expressed support for two outcomes from the Tokyo workshop held in August 2013:  a 40% reduction in fishing mortality on bigeye tuna relative to the 2001-2004 level should be achieved by 2017, and the number of longline and purse seine vessels should be frozen."
WCPFC10,119,"Canada, noting its concerns for the stocks despite not fishing them, concurred with the EU that the measure should be linked to the scientific advice, and should limit the number of options in order to be both practical and enforceable."
WCPFC10,120,Korea thanked Japan for its presentation and comments on the longline fishery but noted that the purse seine fishery is also suffering adverse effects from overcapacity and therefore a freeze on fishing capacity is needed.
WCPFC10,121,Kiribati considered that any changes to fishing rights on the high seas could significantly affect fisheries inside adjacent EEZs.  Therefore it was suggested that domestic fishing vessels be exempted from any effort restrictions on the high seas adjacent to their EEZs.
WCPFC10,122,WCPFC10 agreed to conduct further discussions in an informal small group chaired by Matt Hooper of New Zealand.
WCPFC10,123,"After some discussion of the format and procedures for the informal small group discussions, it was agreed that the observer organizations (i.e. as defined under the WCPFC Rules of Procedure Rule 36 (f)) could be represented by a single participant in the informal small group but this representative would not participate in the discussions, and the content of the discussions would remain confidential until it is reported to the plenary."
WCPFC10,124,"After the first meeting of the informal small group, the Chair of the group reported that a number of sections of the Chair’s draft (WCPFC10-2013/11) had been discussed.  These included:  i) FAD set management (i.e. additional closure months or a fixed number of FAD sets allotted to each CCM); ii) managing purse seine effort on the high seas (i.e. how to set limits and whether to manage under Olympic or allocation rules); iii) prospects for further cuts in longline bigeye tuna catches (i.e. the need to avoid a disproportion burden   19 on purse seine fisheries and how to set baselines); iv) the need for stronger limits on yellowfin tuna catches, and v) longline limits for the high seas and during the FAD closure period.  The Chair of the group requested another session be convened to discuss capacity management issues and to produce a new draft of the tropical tuna CMM.  In response to comments from observer delegations, the Chair of the group suggested that the number of observer representatives allowed to participate in the group be expanded from one to no more than three."
WCPFC10,125,Some CCMs supported the suggestion of the Chair of the informal small group to expand the number of observers to no more than three.
WCPFC10,126,"WWF, on behalf of Pew Charitable Trusts and Greenpeace, presented WCPFC10-2013/OP-07 requesting the Commission to urgently and clearly resolve issues related to observer participation.  Given the Convention’s requirement for transparency, and the number and diversity of observer organizations attending WCPFC10, it was considered that limiting the number of observer participants in the informal small group or constraining their ability to intervene constituted unduly restrictive procedures according to the Convention text.  Although these observers appreciated the Commission’s agreement to slightly increase observer participation, and acknowledged the need for a secure forum for discussion of the draft CMM, they considered the limits on observer participation rendered the informal small group functionally closed.  The Commission was urged to avoid further exclusion of observers from Commission operations and decision-making processes."
WCPFC10,127,"After holding another informal small group session, the Chair of the group reported back to the plenary that work on a revised draft CMM was continuing.  Remaining issues were expected to centre on gaps in high seas purse seine effort limits, bigeye tuna catch reductions for the longline fisheries, and disproportionate burdens."
WCPFC10,128,"A third informal small group session was held to discuss the revised draft CMM.  The Chair of the group reported that the discussions indicated several areas of real progress including specific proposals for implementing a FAD closure.  However, a number of contentious issues remained, particularly associated with disproportionate burdens.  Further revisions to the draft were undertaken."
WCPFC10,129,"After a fourth session, the Chair of the informal small group tabled a draft CMM for discussion by the plenary (WCPFC10-2013/32 (rev5)).  The Chair of the group characterized the proposal as providing operational guidelines for the fishery in 2014 but leaving larger issues such as those associated with disproportionate burdens for future resolution.  Key issues in the draft were highlighted as follows:  i. clarification of catch attribution in the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area; ii. a three-month FAD closure for all purse seine vessels; iii. a requirement for WCPFC11 to adopt arrangements to avoid transferring a disproportionate burden to SIDS as a prerequisite to the commencement of some other components such as those in subparagraph v below;  iv. for 2014, a FAD closure of one additional month (fourth month) or a limit on FAD sets against a baseline of 2010-2012 (specified in an attachment); v. for 2015-2016, a FAD closure of two additional months (fourth and fifth months) or a limit on FAD sets against a baseline of 2010-2012 (specified in an attachment);   20 vi. for 2017, a prohibition on high seas FAD sets with an exemption for Kiribati flagged vessels in its adjacent high seas, and those CCMs that can demonstrate a reduction of bigeye tuna catches to 55% of 2010-2012 levels;  vii. high seas purse seine effort limits for non-SIDS in 2014 (specified in an attachment); viii. requirements for FAD management plans and further consideration of FAD information collection by the WCPFC Scientific Committee (SC); ix. longline catch limits for 2014-2017 for bigeye tuna catches by China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Chinese Taipei and the USA which are over 2000 tonnes (specified in an attachment);  x. no increase in longline catches of yellowfin tuna;  xi. CCMs to consider spatial management approaches;  xii. Non-SIDS, with exceptions for Indonesia and China, to cap the number of purse seine vessels larger than 24 m with freezing capacity in the tropical purse seine fishery at the current level;  xiii. Non-SIDS, with an exception for Indonesia, to cap the number of longline vessels targeting bigeye tuna at the current level; and xiv. Mechanisms for the transfer of capacity to SIDS to be developed."
WCPFC10,130,The Chair thanked participants in the informal small group and its Chair for their efforts in producing the draft measure.
WCPFC10,131,FFA members stated that they reluctantly supported the draft measure produced by the informal small group.  These CCMs considered that the opportunity to better manage the purse seine fishery was only partially taken up and other opportunities for major breakthroughs were missed due to narrow economic interests.  FFA members emphasized their determination to work toward an improved tropical tuna CMM next year.
WCPFC10,132,"PNA members expressed their disappointment that their joint draft with Tokelau, Japan and Philippines was not supported.  In their view, the joint draft would have reduced overfishing of bigeye tuna without placing a disproportionate burden on SIDS whereas the informal small group’s proposal fails to reduce overfishing in a balanced way.  These CCMs considered that their joint draft was opposed by those seeking unfettered access to the high seas, including those conducting IUU fishing activities."
WCPFC10,133,"Japan appreciated the efforts of the informal small group, its Chair and the Secretariat staff who assisted it.  While regretting that its joint efforts with PNA and FFA members did not result in the kind of measure it had hoped for, Japan reconfirmed its commitment to working with these CCMs for a more effective measure next year."
WCPFC10,134,"The Philippines echoed the views of Japan and requested that text regarding the high seas pocket (Footnote #4) from a previous draft, which appeared to have been inadvertently deleted from the draft measure, be restored."
WCPFC10,135,"Papua New Guinea also expressed its disappointment and stated that it is taking appropriate management measures in its own waters.  CCMs were requested to note a revised version of the PNA, Tokelau, Japan and Philippines joint proposal as a benchmark of what could have been achieved (Attachment C).      21"
WCPFC10,136,"WCPFC10 adopted the draft CMM produced by the informal small group, with the restoration of the footnote text requested by the Philippines, as a new CMM for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tunas (Attachment D:  CMM 2013-01)."
WCPFC10,137,"Greenpeace, WWF, the Pew Charitable Trusts, and the International Game Fish Association stated that self-interested views had resulted in a measure that failed to impose any additional FAD-based fishing mortality reductions, included no management of FADs or the purse seine fishery beyond 2014, and contained inadequate capacity management provisions.  These observers concluded that the drafting process was ineffective and urged CCMs to begin work on a new measure immediately in order to achieve a better outcome at WCPFC11.   4.2 Consideration of CCM proposals related to 2013-01 4.2.1 USA FAD information collection and analysis"
WCPFC10,138,"The USA presented a draft CMM on collection and analysis of data on FADs (WCPFC10-2013/DP-05) stating that the IATTC had recently adopted a similar proposal.  It was noted that an earlier version of this proposal was tabled at WCPFC9 and has evolved through discussions before and during TCC9.  Several issues were highlighted as requiring further discussion including marking of FADs and designation of the responsible party for the data collection.  The proposal included i) a definition of a FAD that is consistent with those used in CMM 2008-01 and 2009-02, ii) a requirement for a Vessel FAD Data Reporting Log to be developed in 2014, and iii) initial provisions for non-entangling FADs.  While the USA did not conduct a formal analysis of the potential impact of the measure on SIDS (as called for in WCPFC-2013/DP-02 and WCPFC-2013/DP-35) specific comments on these issues were considered when preparing the text."
WCPFC10,139,Several CCMs suggested a need to discuss specific technical comments in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,140,"FFA members stated that they do not support the proposal because it is impractical in terms of FAD marking, premature in that electronic tracking is not ready for implementation, and duplicative in the sense of voluminous data reporting.  These CCMs also called for a formal analysis against the Article 30 criteria to assess whether the measure represents a disproportionate burden.  They considered that some components of the measure could be incorporated as attachments to the tropical tuna CMM."
WCPFC10,141,Later in the meeting the USA noted that some of the technical comments raised earlier had been addressed and that some components of the proposal had been incorporated into the draft CMM on tropical tunas.       22 AGENDA  ITEM  5  -  COMMISSION REVIEW 5.1 Progress on the review of the Commission – TCC9 Recommendation (para. 391)
WCPFC10,142,"The Executive Director presented a paper containing the recommendations from the WCPFC Performance Review sorted by the subsidiary body to which each recommendation relates and an annotation showing current progress in addressing each issue (WCPFC10-2013/14).  The Executive Director considered that the top three priority items that remain to be addressed are transparency (Recommendation 7.1.1), ensuring that CMMs are legally sound (Recommendation 3.4.7, see WCPFC10-2013/29), and transhipment (Recommendation 6.3.4).  It was noted that many of the performance review recommendations have already been addressed and completed.  The Executive Director suggested that all recommendations which have been addressed and completed be removed from the matrix and that the revised matrix be considered at WCPFC11."
WCPFC10,143,"FFA members agreed with the Executive Director’s suggestion on the proviso that the further streamlining of recommendations give due attention to Article 30 of the Convention, the special requirements of SIDS, and the need to avoid placing disproportionate burden on SIDS."
WCPFC10,144,"WCPFC10 agreed that the Secretariat would revise the matrix contained in WCPFC10-2013/14 to remove all recommendations which have been addressed and completed, and present the revised matrix to WCPFC11.    AGENDA  ITEM  6  -  REPORT OF THE MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES WORKSHOP 6.1 Report on Progress from MOW2"
WCPFC10,145,"Dr Ian Cartwright (Thalassa Consulting) presented the report of the Second Management Options Workshop (MOW2) held 28-29 November 2013.  MOW1 was held before WCPFC9 and was mainly concerned with awareness raising and consideration of a wide range of objectives.  Following MOW1 a ‘Strawman’ (i.e. a candidate list of management objectives, performance indicators, and target reference points (TRPs)) for the tropical longline fishery, the tropical purse seine fishery, the southern longline fishery, the Pacific bluefin tuna fishery and the North Pacific albacore fishery was completed and provided to SC9, NC9 and TCC9 for comment.  Further suggestions for amendments were made following the presentation at MOW 2 and during breakout groups and these were reflected in a final ‘Strawman’ document (WCPFC10-2013/15b).  In that workshop a series of plenary workshop presentations showing examples of the application of target reference points, harvest control rules (HCRs) and trade-offs were provided, followed by break-out groups.  The last day of the workshop drew together comments from the break-out groups via plenary discussions.  A report of MOW2 was provided (WCPFC10-2013/15a), including a recommendation for an interim spawning biomass target reference point for skipjack."
WCPFC10,146,"One CCM requested Dr Cartwright to reflect its suggestion, which was made and accepted at MOW 2 on “Strawman” exactly. Dr Cartwright accepted this.    23"
WCPFC10,147,WCPFC10 accepted the MOW2 (WCPFC10-2013/15a) and “Strawman” (WCPFC10-2013/15a) reports (Attachment E).
WCPFC10,148,"With reference to the recommendation to set a TRP for skipjack tuna at 0.5 unfished spawning biomas, some CCMs considered that as the proposal had only emerged in the last few days there hadn’t been sufficient time to consider it fully in terms of costs and benefits to all fisheries."
WCPFC10,149,One CCM asked for and received confirmation from the Scientific Services Provider (SPC) that the proposed TRP for skipjack is twice as high as the estimated BMSY (which is 0.27unfished spawning biomas).
WCPFC10,150,"One CCM suggested that a range of candidate TRPs including 0.4unfished spawning biomas, 0.5unfished spawning biomas, and 0.6unfished spawning biomas might be endorsed for further consideration.  After consulting with other CCMs in the margins of WCPFC10, and taking input from SPC that it would not be possible to complete further analyses in time for consideration by SC10, this CCM provided draft text on development of a TRP for skipjack for WCPFC10’s consideration."
WCPFC10,151,"WCPFC10 agreed that the Scientific Services Provider provide the following to MOW3 with progress reported to SC10 in 2014 with a view to informing the Commission’s consideration and adoption of a TRP and HCR at WCPFC 11:    i. Evaluate WCPO skipjack stock status against candidate target reference points of 40%, 50% and 60% of unfished spawning stock size. ii. Apply stock-wide harvest control rules such as those present in MOW2-WP/03 and examine robustness relative to the new assessment and major sources of uncertainty. iii. Include performance indicators relating to fish sizes, impacts on yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna, and examine the acceptable magnitude of changes in fishing effort.   6.2 Future Work Plan and Funding"
WCPFC10,152,"Dr Ian Cartwright provided a proposal for continuing the MOW process.  The proposal was based on formal and informal elements, incorporating annual workshops and input into the development of elements of a WCPFC management framework."
WCPFC10,153,"The Chair invited WCPFC10 to consider whether the work of the MOW Independent Expert Panel should be continued.  An initial cost estimate suggested that $350,000 would be required for a two-year extension of the work programme."
WCPFC10,154,PNA members suggested that they could adopt the skipjack TRP as proposed.  Therefore further analysis is not required and should not be included in the Commission’s budget.
WCPFC10,155,"Some CCMs queried why the estimated costs had risen from $100,000 (presented to the FAC) to $350,000, whether more detailed costings would be provided, and whether there might be other funding mechanisms available."
WCPFC10,156,"The Executive Director clarified that the difference in costs arose because the initial estimate had been based on just one additional workshop whereas the new proposal reflects   24 a two-year work programme involving one workshop each year, continued input from the expert panel, and additional scientific and economic analyses to be performed by SPC.  He acknowledged, based on discussions in the FAC, that there are concerns about the amount of funding requested and suggested that external funding sources could be sought.  He also noted that the PNA will be developing a TRP for skipjack tuna in parallel with this work."
WCPFC10,157,Some CCMs indicated their general support for the management options work but were concerned about the proposed costs and considered it necessary to analyse the results produced thus far before proceeding with additional work.
WCPFC10,158,Some CCMs agreed with the need to carefully consider the output thus far but urged the Commission not to lose momentum in the development of its fisheries management framework.
WCPFC10,159,"One CCM noted that work on limit reference points (LRPs), TRPs and HCR is proceding under the Northern Committee."
WCPFC10,160,Some CCMs supported authorization of funding for the two annual workshops and suggested that external funding be sought to support the continued input of the expert panel and the analyses by SPC.
WCPFC10,161,One CCM supported authorizing funding for one additional workshop only.
WCPFC10,162,"In response to a question regarding whether there would be any value in holding a workshop without any input material from the expert panel and the SPC analyses, the Executive Director considered that at a minimum an additional workshop would provide the opportunity for CCMs to discuss the outputs produced by MOW1 and MOW2."
WCPFC10,163,ISSF and WWF stated their support for continued work on management options and offered to assist in securing the funding necessary for the full package of work proposed.
WCPFC10,164,"WCPFC agreed to hold an additional workshop on management options (MOW3) in 2014 and to task the Executive Director with exploring external sources of funding for a second workshop in 2015, further input from the expert panel and supporting analyses by the Scientific Services Provider.    AGENDA  ITEM  7  -  REPORT OF THE E-MONITORING AND E-REPORTING STUDY 7.1 Report from the Study"
WCPFC10,165,"Dr Ian Knuckey (Fishwell Consulting) presented the results of the E-reporting and E-monitoring study (WCPFC10-2013/16).  The objectives of the project were to:  i) develop a common understanding and language of E-reporting and E-monitoring; ii) document and evaluate existing and future E-reporting and E-monitoring technologies; and  iii) propose potential scenarios for implementation of E-reporting and E-monitoring in the WCPO tuna fisheries.  E-reporting is defined as an “open system” relying on manual inputs and transmission whereas E-monitoring is defined as a “closed system” in which video or sensor data is collected and transmitted automatically.  A global review revealed an   25 abundance of E-reporting products are available that would suit WCPO tuna fisheries. There were fewer examples of E-monitoring products and limited levels of adoption in global fisheries.  The main stakeholder issues on potential implementation of E-reporting and E-monitoring technologies were presented including employment, research, compliance, efficiency and occupational health and safety.  Overall, it was concluded that improved timeliness and quality of data, together with increased efficiencies offered by E-reporting and E-monitoring technologies would provide more certainty in research and stock assessments, more targeted and certain MCS activities, and better management decisions.  Ultimately, these would lead to improved fishery sustainability.  The study produced five strategic recommendations:    i. Implement both E-reporting and E-monitoring programs without delay;  ii. Develop standards, specifications, and certification procedures for both E-reporting and E-monitoring; iii. Implement E-reporting in a phased approach determined by technical feasibility, and practical considerations and constraints; iv. Recognise E-monitoring as a legitimate, appropriate and acceptable monitoring tool; and v. Implement separate but parallel processes to move E-reporting and E-monitoring technologies forward."
WCPFC10,166,"Peter Williams (SPC) presented an update on SPC E-reporting trials conducted since August 2013.  There were two systems being trialled:  an electronic logbook (eTUNALOG; open-source and available for download on the SPC website) and an electronic data entry system for observers while onboard purse seine vessels (eTUBS).  The eTUNALOG system is configured to transmit logbook data in parallel to the fishing company and the national fisheries authority as an email attachment.  This system has been trialled with 13 purse seine vessels from the Solomon Islands, New Zealand, FSM, RMI and the USA.  The eTUBS system involves observers entering onboard data directly into a laptop; the data are not transmitted from the laptop but downloaded for auditing and import into the main observer databases on return to port.  This system has been trialled on seven purse seine trips.  Results thus far have been excellent with positive feedback received from the trial participants.  It is recognized, however, than an E-reporting coordinator is fundamental for time-intensive training, data auditing and debriefing activities."
WCPFC10,167,Ludwig Kumoru (PNG) updated WCPFC10 on PNG’s progress with electronic fisheries management systems.  Bilateral partners will begin using an electronic version of the logsheet forms in January 2014.  Observers and port samplers will begin using android operating system tablets and smartphones for E-logging by mid-2014.  The catch documentation scheme is also using E-forms including forms for transhipment.  E-monitoring of vessels is not yet implemented.   7.2 Consideration of Future Work
WCPFC10,168,"One CCM considered the consultant’s study was well done and supported progress toward E-reporting and E-monitoring systems.  However, this CCM cautioned that adequate account should be taken of developing standards in international fora (e.g. UN/CEFACT) to avoid WCPFC standards being incompatible or duplicative."
WCPFC10,169,"Some CCMs expressed support for some of the study’s recommendations regarding E-reporting and E-monitoring for centralized data management activities within the   26 Commission, but did not agree that Commission-level standards and certifications would necessarily pre-empt the development or implementation of national systems."
WCPFC10,170,"FFA members indicated that a more thorough review of the study’s recommendations regarding standards and certification procedures would be required before these could be endorsed.  Primary concerns are that any new standards and certifications be compatible with the national and regional information management systems already under development, and that any new systems learn from these existing systems.  These CCMs suggested that the Secretariat should develop draft specifications for review in parallel with a full analysis of costs and benefits to SIDS with regard to Article 30 in early 2014.  Further discussions could be held in March 2014 in conjunction with the MCS Working Group meeting in Honiara."
WCPFC10,171,"The Executive Director clarified that the objectives were not to impose systems on CCMs domestically, but rather to speed and improve the quality of data flowing to the Commission.  It was also noted that the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ) project will initiate E-monitoring trials in Fiji and Ghana.  Funding received from Australia is intended to be used to consider issues related to the impacts of electronic systems on employment in SIDS."
WCPFC10,172,Some CCMs considered that if further discussion of E-reporting and E-monitoring topics is to be held in conjunction with the MCS Working Group meeting in Honiara the range of participants in that working group may need to be broadened.
WCPFC10,173,WCPFC10 agreed that further discussions on E-reporting and E-monitoring should be held at a workshop in early 2014 at a venue to be determined by the Secretariat and the result should be reported to TCC10.     AGENDA  ITEM  8  -  SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE (SC) 8.1 Report of the Ninth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee
WCPFC10,174,"The SC Chair, Ludwig Kumoru (PNG), presented the report of SC9 (WCPFC10-2013/17) using a summary format (WCPFC10-2013/17a) to highlight results in the areas of stock status and assessment, data and statistics, management issues, ecosystems and bycatch, and other issues.   8.1.1 Stock Status of Key Tuna Species"
WCPFC10,175,"Dr John Hampton (SPC) summarized the status of key tuna and non-tuna stocks in the WCPO.  According to Kobe plots based on past years’ stock assessments and existing reference points, three of the four main tropical tuna stocks are in the green quadrant, i.e. they are not overfished and overfishing is not occurring.  However, all three are expected to track toward higher exploitation and lower biomass levels over time.  Stock status plots may also shift as new stock assessments are completed in the coming year and as new reference points develop.  The uncertainty is relatively higher for the South Pacific albacore fishery due to the nature of the fishery and the data available.  Bigeye tuna are currently assessed as overfishing occurring but not being overfished; managing the stock to   27 reduce fishing mortality on this stock is one of the key tasks for WCPFC10.  In undertaking stock assessments in 2014 SPC will incorporate recommendations from the recent bigeye tuna stock assessment peer review in bigeye, as well as in yellowfin and skipjack, assessments."
WCPFC10,176,"The purse seine fishery in 2012 was a record high in terms of both catch (1.8 million mt) and effort.  Although most of the catch is comprised of skipjack, the yellowfin catch continues to increase.  The number of vessels in the fishery also continues to trend upwards with 2013 registering the largest number of vessels ever.  As the number of FAD sets has been stable since the mid-2000s, recent effort increases have been driven by free school sets.  Management measures requiring FAD closures do not appear to have reduced the annual number of FAD sets but have contained growth in FAD sets in the face of purse seine effort that has continued to increase despite management measures designed to control it.  Purse seine effort within PNA countries’ EEZs has been stable whereas purse seine effort on the high seas has increased slightly since 2011."
WCPFC10,177,"Longline catch has been stable over the past 10-15 years but species composition has shifted toward a larger portion of the catch comprised of South Pacific albacore in the southern hemisphere.  In the northern hemisphere longline catches of bigeye, yellowfin and northern albacore have been reasonably stable over time.  Longline effort in the tropical areas has been stable for some time but appears to show a decline in 2013.  In the southern part of the fishing grounds effort, in terms of number of days fished, continues to increase."
WCPFC10,178,"In 2012 the skipjack catch increased 9% over 2011, driven mainly by an increase in the purse seine fishery.  Although there is no evidence of persistent declines in catch per unit effort, periods of unusually low CPUE occurred in mid-2011 and possibly in the first half of 2013.  For bigeye tuna, longline fishery bigeye catches have declined steadily since the 1990s to record lows whereas overall the catch composition has shifted towards the purse seine fishery with the increased use of FADs.  Yellowfin catches were high in 2012, due to the purse seine fishery and Indonesia’s fleets, but catch per unit effort is slowly declining with time.  South Pacific albacore catches increased 24% in 2011 and was 22% higher than the five-year average.  Albacore is a declining component of the troll fishery.  Catch per unit effort by longline has declined over the last 20 years and is now ~20kg per 100 hooks, below the level of economic viability for some fleets."
WCPFC10,179,Several non-tuna species have also been assessed.  South Pacific swordfish are not likely to be overfished but there is some possibility that overfishing is occurring.  For striped marlin overfishing is not likely to be occurring but there is some possibility that the stock is overfished.  Recent shark stock assessments have indicated that the oceanic whitetip shark stock is heavily depleted and the silky shark stock is overfished and overfishing is occurring.
WCPFC10,180,The SC Chair noted six recommendations from SC9 regarding stock status and assessment:    i. Maintain the North Pacific albacore stock status and management advice from SC8 (SC9 report paras. 179-180); ii. Note majority and minority views on the stock status and management advice for Pacific bluefin tuna (SC9 report paras 194-196); iii. Maintain the North Pacific swordfish stock status and management advice from SC6 (SC9 report paras. 204-205);   28 iv. Review a revised assessment for North Pacific blue shark at SC10 and adopt a precautionary approach to management in the interim (SC9 report paras. 259-262);  v. Maintain the North Pacific striped marlin stock status and management advice from SC8 (SC9 report paras. 296-297); and  vi. Note the finding that the North Pacific blue marlin stock is not currently overfished but it is nearly fully exploited and thus the fishing mortality rate should not be increased (SC9 report paras. 308-309).
WCPFC10,181,WCPFC10 accepted the six stock status and assessment recommendations of SC9.    Data and Statistics Theme
WCPFC10,182,"The SC Chair noted seven recommendations from SC9 regarding data and statistics:    i. TCC9 to consider how to fill gaps in operational data (SC9 report para. 77a); ii. TCC9 to consider alternatives to operational data (SC9 report para. 77b); iii. WCPFC10 to note the implications arising from a lack of operational data (SC9 report para. 77c); iv. The Secretariat to contact CCMs who do not submit operational data or numbers of vessels for each spatial unit (SC9 report para. 77d); v. Other gear catches of tropical tuna excluding fisheries with <2000 mt to be forwarded to TCC9 (SC9 report para. 77e);  vi. Stock assessments for SC10 should use catch and effort data through 2012 but projections should use data through 2013 (SC9 report paras. 77f); and  vii. The Scientific Services Provider should continue work on species composition in the purse seine fishery (SC9 report, para. 90)."
WCPFC10,183,WCPFC10 accepted the seven data and statistics recommendations of SC9.    Management Issues Theme
WCPFC10,184,"The SC Chair noted seven recommendations from SC9 regarding management issues:  i. Guidelines for the time window to be used in the LRP 20%SBF=0, t1-t2 (SC9 report, paras. 357-359);  ii. Identification of the appropriate values of X for each species in the LRP FX%SPR0 be based on an iterative search to “match” FX%SPR0 with 20%SBF=0,t1-t2 as described in the working paper (SC9-MI-WP-03), and once the level of acceptable risk that should be applied to breaching an LRP has been identified by WCPFC10, the appropriate values of X for each species in the LRP FX%SPR0 be calculated using the updated assessments to be presented to SC10 (SC9 report, paras. 360-361);  iii. LRPs should be used in future stock assessment summaries (SC9 report, para. 362); iv. Early warning or trigger reference points should be identified (SC9 report, para. 363); v. Guidelines for using a hierarchical approach to describe uncertainty (SC9 report, para. 385); vi. SC10 to consider how to assign plausibility weights to models (SC9 report, para. 386); and vii. Note SC9’s conclusions regarding the draft tropical tuna CMM (SC9 report, para. 408).      29"
WCPFC10,185,"In response to a question from the Chair on time window, SPC explained that since productivity and recruitment vary over time, it is necessary to use an average value that best represents current and near future conditions.  This was the basis for the SC9 guidelines in the SC9 report at paras. 357-359."
WCPFC10,186,"The Commission endorsed SC’s recommendation for a 10 year time window in relation to the LRP 20%SBF=0, t1-t2."
WCPFC10,187,"In response to a question from the Chair on the level of risk, SPC clarified that SC9 recommended acceptable levels of risk associated with breaching LRPs at 5 or 10% for example because best practice requires that there should be a high probability that LRPs not be breached.  If the acceptable risk level is identified then scientists can work backwards to develop management strategies that meet these risk criteria.  This was the basis for the SC9 guidelines in the SC9 report at para. 361."
WCPFC10,188,"Some CCMs considered that a wider range of risks should be considered and that because the acceptable level of risk may be different for different fisheries and stocks, it would not be appropriate to set a single risk level in advance that is applied to all situations."
WCPFC10,189,Some CCMs supported the SC9 recommendation in SC9 report paras. 360-361 and requested that a 5% risk level be applied in stock assessments to be conducted for SC10.
WCPFC10,190," Some CCMs noted that the methodology proposed by SC9 to develop fishing mortality (F) based limit reference points (SC9 report paras. 357-359) is based on deriving these directly from biomass-based LRPs.  The F-based LRPs are thus not independent and may not provide an appropriate basis for developing management measures to control fishing mortality.  These CCMs encouraged the SC and science services provider to examine the expected outcomes of various management scenarios relative to reference points, providing a wider range of risk levels than the 5% and 10% levels used In SC9-MI-WP-03.  It was considered that as a biomass-based LRP has now been adopted, the Commission should focus on developing appropriate biomass-based TRPs or fishing mortality-based TRPs for yellowfin, bigeye, skipjack and south Pacific albacore."
WCPFC10,191,Japan noted that Pacific bluefin tuna are in urgent need of a stock recovery and NC 9 agreed to develop at NC10 a rebuilding programme . Japan also stated that this will involve development of a LRP by the ISC which will be presented to the Northern Committee.
WCPFC10,192,"WCPFC10 decided to refer the LRP issues of acceptable level of risk to SC, for further clarification of the implications of accepting various alternative proposals.  SC was requested to provide its recommendations to WCPFC11 in sufficient detail and in a format easily understood by managers.            30 Ecosystem and Bycatch Theme"
WCPFC10,193,"The SC Chair noted twelve recommendations from SC9 regarding ecosystem and bycatch:    i. Support the Bycatch Mitigation Information System (SC9 report, para. 419a);  ii. Support ongoing development of SEAPODYM (SC9 report, para. 419b); iii. CCMs to provide fine-scale data for use in SEAPODYM (SC9 report, para. 419c); iv. Consider an external review of SEAPODYM (SC9 report para. 419d);  v. Develop reference points for key shark species (SC9 report para. 465a); vi. Develop safe release guidelines for sharks (SC9 report para. 465b); vii. Implement logsheets showing retained and discarded sharks (SC9 report para. 465c); viii. Develop an integrated and comprehensive shark CMM (SC9 report para. 465d); ix. Consider measures to reduce mortality on overfished sharks (SC9 report para. 465e);  x. Investigate the vessel length-based exclusion from seabird mitigation measures in the North Pacific (SC9 report para. 489a); xi. Forward the ACAP seabird identification guide to observer programmes (SC9 report para. 489b); and xii. Undertake a pilot project on E-monitoring in a WCPFC longline fishery (SC9 report para. 489c)."
WCPFC10,194,WCPFC10 accepted the twelve ecosystem and bycatch recommendations of SC9.     Other Issues
WCPFC10,195,The SC Chair noted that the GEF West Pacific East Asia (WPEA) Project Phase 1 was completed in March 2013 and that the development of WPEA Phase 2 is now underway.
WCPFC10,196,Dr John Hampton (SPC) informed WCPFC10 that the Pacific Tuna Tagging Project (PTTP) recently completed a successful cruise in PNG and bigeye tuna tagging is set to continue for several more years through funding received from New Zealand.  CCMs were requested to help facilitate tag returns.  A report on the PTTP was presented to SC9 (see RP-PTTP-01 and RP-PTTP-02).
WCPFC10,197,"The SC Chair noted that SC9 had recognized a request from SIDS to cooperate in four specific areas:  research and technology transfer, human resources capacity building, best practice initiatives, and data collection and monitoring and evaluation (SC9 report, para. 509)."
WCPFC10,198,WCPFC10 noted these issues from the SC9 report.     8.2 Future Work Programme and Budget for 2014-2016
WCPFC10,199,"The SC Chair noted the SC work programme and budget for 2014-2016 highlighting that stock assessments for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tunas and North Pacific blue shark, as well as an analysis of potential mitigation options for silky and oceanic whitetip sharks, will be conducted under the Scientific Services Provider’s current service agreement."
WCPFC10,200,The SC Chair noted that the SC had reviewed and responded to recommendations arising from the Commission’s Independent Performance Review.     31
WCPFC10,201,"The SC Chair requested nominations for an SC Vice-Chair and announced that the next meeting of the SC would be held in Majuro, RMI."
WCPFC10,202,FSM queried whether there is a formal agreement that the SC will be held in Pohnpei every other year.
WCPFC10,203,The Secretariat responded that this is a general understanding rather than a formal arrangement.
WCPFC10,204,The Chair noted that the Secretariat would discuss this issue further with FSM.    8.3 Adoption of the SC9 Summary Report
WCPFC10,205,WCPFC10 thanked the SC Chair for his efforts and adopted the SC9 Summary Report.    AGENDA  ITEM  9  -  NORTHERN COMMITTEE 9.1 Report of the Ninth Regular Session of the Northern Committee
WCPFC10,206,"The Chair of the Northern Committee (NC), Masanori Miyahara (Japan), presented the report of NC9 (WCPFC10-2013/18).  The meeting focused on the status of the Pacific bluefin tuna stock which was assessed as being heavily overfished and experiencing low recruitment for 2011-2012.  This situation suggests i) there is considerable risk of the spawning stock biomass falling below its historic low level, and ii) current management is likely to be less effective than expected.  A draft CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna was prepared (WCPFC10-2013/27) which specifies the current F as the average 2002-2004 level, calls for a 15% reduction in F for 2014 only, deletes the exemption for artisanal and Korean fleets, and requires monitoring of recruitment and development of an emergency response if recruitment is extremely low.  Korea took a reservation on the removal of its exemption.  In the coming year, the NC will develop a rebuilding programme for Pacific bluefin tuna.  NC9 discussed reference points for North Pacific albacore but did not reach agreement despite a useful paper contributed by the USA.  Also, NC9 requested that WCPFC10 task the SC with considering whether North Pacific blue shark should be designated as a northern stock.  NC9 will hold its next meeting in September in Japan."
WCPFC10,207,"Korea explained that it catches Pacific bluefin tuna as bycatch in its jack mackerel fishery, one of the most important fisheries in Korea.  While the CMM will affect this fishery, in acknowledgement of the severely depleted state of the resource, and as a responsible fishing nation, Korea agreed to withdraw its reservation.  Korea will gather more data on its bycatch of juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna in order to support better management of the stock."
WCPFC10,208,Japan expressed its appreciation to Korea for withdrawing the reservation on the Korea fishery exemption.      32
WCPFC10,209,The USA committed to carrying out further work on reference points for North Pacific albacore.
WCPFC10,210,"Pew Charitable Trusts, WWF and Greenpeace noted that the latest ISC stock assessment estimates the Pacific bluefin tuna stock has been reduced to 3.6% of its unfished levels and recommends that fishing mortality be reduced.  However, under the draft CMM overall catch would be allowed to increase thereby offering inadequate protection to this severely depleted species.  These observers consider that this approach is not precautionary.  They called for a rebuilding plan to be tabled at WCPFC11 including provisions within the plan for the suspension of fishing if rebuilding is unsuccessful."
WCPFC10,211,Mexico stated that it has taken management measures in the Eastern Pacific to protect the stock but it considers that fishing nations in the Western Pacific need to do more to achieve equitable measures since most of the fishing mortality on juveniles takes place in the Western Pacific.
WCPFC10,212,Japan considered that Mexico’s fishery is catching mainly juvenile Pacific bluefin and therefore their continued participation in ISC and the NC is strongly encouraged.
WCPFC10,213,WCPFC10 adopted a revised CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna (replacing CMM 2012-06) (Attachment F: CMM 2013-09).
WCPFC10,214,"Japan stated that the relevant provisions of UNCLOS, UNFSA and Article 4 of the WCPF Convention make it very clear that the Convention applies only to the high seas and EEZs in the Convention Area but does not apply to territorial seas, archipelagic waters and internal waters, unless otherwise specified such as measures for inspection at port.  Japan stressed that its view on the area of the application on the Convention does not mean that Japan would allow the Pacific bluefin tuna fisheries in its territorial seas and internal waters to be operated without regard to the new Pacific bluefin tuna measure.  Rather, Japan assured WCPFC10 that it would fulfil its responsibility as a major Pacific bluefin tuna fishing nation by conserving and managing this stock in its territorial seas and internal waters in a way that is compatible with the newly adopted CMM."
WCPFC10,215,"The USA noted its request for two revisions to the analyses to be conducted in 2014 in support of the Pacific bluefin rebuilding plan (WCPFC10-2013/DP-31).  It requested that the ISC i) consider two additional management scenarios, and ii) revise the definitions of juvenile and adult fisheries in the analysis to align with those used in previous analyses."
WCPFC10,216,WCPFC10 agreed that the United States’ requests on PBT above be forwarded to ISC for incorporation into the analyses.
WCPFC10,217,WCPFC10 adopted the report of NC9 and asked the SC to evaluate whether North Pacific blue shark would qualify as a northern stock.      33 AGENDA  ITEM  10  -  TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE 10.1 Report of the Ninth Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee
WCPFC10,218,"The TCC Chair, Rhea Moss-Christian presented the report of TCC9 (WCPFC10-2013/WP-19).  The following nine recommendations by TCC9 for the consideration of WCPFC10 were highlighted:    i. Extend the manual reporting requirements under the VMS SSPs for one year (TCC9 Report, para. 136); ii. Exempt vessels in good standing on the FFA Vessel Register from requirements to submit a VTAF (TCC9 Report, para. 137); iii. Agree guidelines for timely submission of ROP data (TCC9 Report, para. 160); iv. Include HSBI elements in the CMR process (TCC9 Report, para. 236); v. Task the Secretariat with preparing a report on transhipment activities (TCC9 Report, para. 267); vi. Task the Scientific Services Provider with providing specific information on South Pacific Swordfish to SC10 (TCC9 Report, para.344);  vii. Agree the definition of a purse seine day in transit (TCC9 Report, para. 387);  viii. Clarify that for CMM 2005-03, the reporting responsibility lies with the flag State (TCC9 Report, para. 116); and ix. Clarify that CCMs identify in their 2014 Annual Report Part 2 which metric they used to calculate the percentage of longline observer coverage for 2013 (TCC9 Report, para. 117)."
WCPFC10,219,One CCM queried and received confirmation of their understanding that the flag State reporting responsibility for CMM 2005-03 (North Pacific albacore) refers to the catch and effort reporting responsibilities in paras. 3 and 4 of that CMM.
WCPFC10,220,WCPFC10 adopted TCC9 recommendations i-vi and viii-ix above.
WCPFC10,221,"One CCM queried why the definition of a purse seine day in transit was limited to the area between 10oN and 10oS (TCC9 report, para. 387 and recommendation vii above)."
WCPFC10,222,SPC explained that since the vast majority of purse seine fishing operations take place between 10oN and 10oS it is appropriate to assume that purse seine vessels outside this area are in transit.
WCPFC10,223,"Some CCMs sought further clarification of the wording of the definition of a purse seine day in transit as recommended by TCC9, and as a result the wording of the definition was amended."
WCPFC10,224,"WCPFC10 adopted revised wording for the definition of purse seine effort to be reported on logbooks and the requirements in the “Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission” and are consistent with the PNA VDS System and observer reporting:    “The current definition for a purse seine day in transit (‘a day in transit’) should only cover the following cases:    Transiting from port to the tropical WCPFC area (10°N - 10°S); or   34  Transiting back to port; or  Transiting from one fishing zone to another in the Convention Area. Where vessels are transiting as described above, the conditions of transit are that the gear is stowed, with the boom lowered and tied down, and the net covered.”** Footnote: **Subject to any further clarification.”  10.1.1 Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures –Report on Compliance Monitoring Scheme Provisional CMS and Executive Summary"
WCPFC10,225,"The TCC Chair described how TCC9 prepared the Provisional CMR (WCPFC10-2013/20).  The recommendations of TCC9 concerning the development of the Provisional CMR are contained in the TCC9 Summary Report (paras. 81-89).  WCPFC10 was reminded that two recommendations from TCC9 regarding the clarification of compliance obligations arising from CMMs were agreed after consideration by WCPFC10 of the TCC9 Summary Report (see Agenda Item 10.1, recommendations viii and ix).  Given that any additional information submitted by CCMs since TCC9 had not yet been reviewed, the TCC Chair suggested that any necessary updates to the Provisional CMR be considered by a small working group (SWG-CMS)."
WCPFC10,226,"FFA members stated that information submitted since TCC9 should be taken into account before the 2012 CMR is adopted.  These CCMs considered that the CMS is a work in progress and that while it is evolving in a positive way, further enhancements are required."
WCPFC10,227,Two CCMs requested that information they submitted after TCC9 be considered.
WCPFC10,228,One of these CCMs considered that the CMS should aim for greater transparency and asked that the process be open to observers.
WCPFC10,229,"Reporting back from the SWG-CMS, the TCC Chair noted that 16 CCMs provided information additional to that considered in the development of the Provisional CMR.  This information was considered and text from the Provisional CMR was amended and adapted as necessary for the Final CMR.  Draft text for the Executive Summary of the Final CMR was considered by WCPFC10 and within this text wording regarding CCM obligations to provide operational data was adjusted by consensus.  The SWG-CMS recommended that the table of CCMs by obligation and the compliance matrix from the Provisional CMR be included in the Final CMR, noting that this will mean these tables become public information."
WCPFC10,230,"In response to a CCM’s query, it was confirmed that the two tables have been updated based on the work of the SWG-CMS at WCPFC10."
WCPFC10,231,"The SWG-CMS recommended to WCPFC10 to consider a template developed by the Secretariat proposed for use in preparing the 2014 draft Compliance Monitoring Report (WCPFC10-2013/20, Annex II)."
WCPFC10,232,WCPFC10 adopted the Final Compliance Monitoring Report for 2012 containing the adjusted wording of the Executive Summary and two tables from the Provisional CMR (Attachment G).     35
WCPFC10,233,"WCPFC10 adopted a template for preparation of the 2014 draft Compliance Monitoring Report (Attachment H: WCPFC10-2013/20, Annex II)."
WCPFC10,234,"FFA members articulated their support for the evolving CMS process but requested further delineation between the roles of the Secretariat, the TCC and CCMs.  Specifically, there are some components of the CMS that are factual and can be assessed by the Secretariat.  In contrast, some components of the CMS require value judgements and should be assessed by the TCC.  FFA members asked that the Secretariat and the TCC Chair work intersessionally to refine the process for development of the draft CMRs.  Finally, with regard to WCPFC10-2013/20, FFA members considered it the responsibility of TCC, rather than the Secretariat, to decide which paragraphs of the selected CMMs should be included in the draft CMR."
WCPFC10,235,"FFA members stated that in developing the CMS it is important to maintain a long-term, strategic vision of where the CMS should be in ten years’ time including processes to promote greater independence, verification and external review."
WCPFC10,236,"FFA members considered that in developing responses to non-compliance two principles should be maintained.  First, responses should be graduated so that capacity building rather than penalties can be prioritized as responses for SIDS.  Second, the magnitude, and number or duration, of the non-compliances should be taken into account so that inadvertent occurrences can be separated from intentional ones."
WCPFC10,237,"FFA members recognized non-CCMs’ concerns about the closed nature of the CMS process but noted the need to maintain the security of CMS information given past instances of misuse.  It was suggested that the information should remain as non-public domain data under the Commission data rules, but that arrangements such as confidentiality agreements could be developed to allow observer participation. non-public data rules and confidentiality agreements could be developed to allow observer participation and increase transparency."
WCPFC10,238,Some CCMs supported the FFA members’ call for greater transparency and observer participation in the CMS process.
WCPFC10,239,Some CCMs appreciated and emphasized the importance of the Secretariat’s role in the CMS process.  These CCMs stated that the Secretariat provides an essential filtering function which avoids swamping the TCC with more information than it can effectively process.
WCPFC10,240,"The Executive Director stated that the Secretariat is endeavouring to be flexible and respond to the changing demands of the CMS year by year.  However, he noted that the current situation is characterized by differing expectations of the work required over a very short timeframe and a lack of clear direction from the Commission places strain on the relationship between the Secretariat and the TCC Chair."
WCPFC10,241,The Chair noted that there is a continuing lack of clarity about the appropriate roles for the Secretariat and the TCC with regard to the CMS and encouraged CCMs to discuss these issues in the margins of WCPFC10.      36 10.1.2 Adoption of the IUU List for 2014
WCPFC10,242,"The TCC Chair referred WCPFC10 to a paper which summarizes the situation with regard to the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2014 (WCPFC10-2013/21).  TCC9 received no requests for removal of any of the vessels currently on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List, nor did it receive any nominations for vessels to be added to the list.  Therefore TCC9 recommended to the Commission that the WCPFC IUU Vessel List remain unchanged."
WCPFC10,243,FFA members requested that TCC consider additional ways of working with flag States to seek resolution with those vessels which have remained on the IUU Vessel List for many years.
WCPFC10,244,"FFA members also noted that the WCPFC IUU Vessel List does not reflect all the incidents of IUU fishing which have occurred in the Convention Area.  These CCMs encouraged other CCMs and the Commission as a whole to take a more rigorous approach to analysing these incidents, and the vessels and persons involved, and to develop profiles of behaviour.  It was noted that FFA has begun such work and will discuss it at TCC10."
WCPFC10,245,"WCPFC10 agreed to maintain the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2013 comprising three vessels, the Neptune, the Fu Lien No. 1 and the Yu Fong 168, as the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2014.  (Attachment I)  10.2 Regional Observer Programme-Technical Advisory Group (ROP-TAG) Report"
WCPFC10,246,"Philip Lens, Chair of the ROP-TAG, presented the ROP-TAG’s report for 2013 (WCPFC10-2013/22).  From a total of 19 recommendations from the ROP-TAG, TCC9 endorsed nine recommendations.  The first of these was that notification requirements for fish carriers should be discussed at TCC10 (TCC9 Report para. 177).  WCPFC10 was invited to consider the remaining eight recommendations:    i. Task the Secretariat with developing guidelines for observer credentials (TCC9 Report para. 182); ii. Task the Secretariat with developing a paper on minimum standards to prevent misconduct of observers (TCC9 Report para. 184); iii. Notification of the Secretariat by national observer programmes of the roster of trained observers as soon as practical (TCC9 Report para. 198);  iv. Notification of the Secretariat by national observer programmes of the active observer list every three months (TCC9 Report para. 199); v. Notification of the Secretariat by national observer programmes of any observers removed from the active observer list due to misconduct (TCC9 Report, para. 200); vi. Request CCMs to provide responses on how best to deal with corruption issues for discussion at TCC10 (TCC9 Report, para. 204); vii. Task the Secretariat with preparing an observer handbook of CMMs (TCC9 Report, para. 206); and viii. Reconstitute the Intersessional Working Group-Regional Observer Programme (IWG-ROP) to address ROP implementation issues (TCC9 Report, para. 207)."
WCPFC10,247,"One CCM noted that misconduct in the ROP can originate either from the observers or from the vessel captains and crew, and both aspects of the problem should be examined.  Penalties should be established which discourage misconduct from either party.     37"
WCPFC10,248,"With regard to the IWG-ROP, FFA members stated their cautious support for its re-establishment.  These CCMs stated that many of the ROP issues appear to have reached a stalemate and the burden of holding additional meetings on these issues should be minimized through opportunities to co-host meetings of the IWG-ROP with other meetings, and by providing funding to support SIDS participation."
WCPFC10,249,"The Chair reminded WCPFC10 that TCC9 had also recommended that if the IWG-ROP is re-constituted, it should consider issues associated with observer coverage targets for longline fleets (TCC9 Report, para. 225)."
WCPFC10,250,"WCPFC10 agreed to reconstitute the IWG-ROP and to task it with considering, inter alia, observer coverage targets for longline fleets.   10.3 Intersessional Working Group-Catch Documentation Scheme Report"
WCPFC10,251,"The Executive Director presented a report on the work of the IWG-CDS on behalf of its Chair Alois Kinol (WCPFC10-2013/23).  The first meeting was held shortly after the close of TCC9.  One of the key outcomes was for CCMs to provide background documents and information on their implementation of current CDS-related initiatives.  Papua New Guinea has provided $30,000 US to support a consultant to prepare a paper on these existing schemes and how they might relate to the Commission’s CDS.  The Secretariat is currently working with the Chair of the IWG-CDS to develop terms of reference for the paper.  This paper will form the basis for the next meeting of the IWG-ROP which is likely to be held immediately prior to TCC10."
WCPFC10,252,"FFA members considered that the deadline of end November 2013 for providing information on current CDS-related initiatives was unrealistic and suggested that the deadline be extended to the end of March 2014.  This will allow FFA members to provide more information on their developing regional standards.  These CCMs supported the proposed paper, thanked Papua New Guinea for funding it, and looked forward to discussing it at the proposed pre-TCC10 meeting."
WCPFC10,253,WCPFC10 noted the progress of the IWG-CDS and endorsed its plan to produce an analysis of existing CDS-related initiatives for discussion prior to TCC10.    10.4 Future Work Plan and Budget for 2014-2016
WCPFC10,254,The TCC Chair presented the TCC Work Plan and Budget for 2014-2016 (WCPFC-TCC9-2013/22).
WCPFC10,255,"Some CCMs requested further clarification of the $10,000 US to be used to support a consultancy study on the improvement of purse seine catch composition data."
WCPFC10,256,"The FAC report (WCPFC10-2013/25, para. 23) later clarified that this amount is to be used to undertake a study to identify compliance issues with vessels reporting purse seine species composition in logbooks."
WCPFC10,257,WCPFC10 adopted the TCC Work Plan and Budget for 2014-2016 as proposed by TCC9.     38  10.5 Legal Framework for CMMs
WCPFC10,258,The Secretariat tabled a paper describing the background to this issue and suggestions for a way forward in WCPFC10-2013/29.
WCPFC10,259,This issue was not discussed at WCPFC10.    10.6 Adoption of the TCC9 Report
WCPFC10,260,WCPFC10 adopted the TCC9 Summary Report.    AGENDA  ITEM  11  -  CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES 11.1 Consideration of New CMMs and Other Conservation Requirements 11.1.1 Compliance Monitoring Scheme
WCPFC10,261,"The USA presented a draft CMM on extension of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (WCPFC10-2013/DP-06).  Comments on the draft CMM were received from CCMs and incorporated.  Key changes were highlighted in the areas of i) the process for producing the Provisional Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR), ii) the categories of compliance (and acknowledging the reasons why non-compliances may occur), iii) the role of the Secretariat, and iv) the process for evaluating the Provisional CMR and producing a Final CMR.  The USA considered that the three years of CMS trials have resulted in useful experience and it is now time to convert the scheme from a one-year to a permanent basis.  In addition, the draft CMM contains a provision to establish an Intersessional Working Group (IWG-CMS) to begin developing responses to non-compliance."
WCPFC10,262,"Some CCMs supported the proposal in general but wished to suggest minor, technical amendments."
WCPFC10,263,FFA members also expressed interest in discussing the details of the proposal.  These CCMs stated that the CMS should be authorized for one year rather than be made permanent.
WCPFC10,264,The Chair suggested that the USA continue to consult on this proposal in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,265,"After further consultation the USA tabled WCPFC10-2013/DP-06 (rev 1).  Amendments included expanding the scope of the CMS to encompass reporting for seabird and other non-target species, authorizations to fish and the RFV.  The new draft proposal removed the provision allowing CCMs to submit additional information against the Provisional CMR up to 30 days prior to the Commission meeting.  In accordance with input from CCMs, the measure was proposed to run for one year only.  An additional compliance   39 status of “priority non-compliant” was added which would trigger additional compliance review actions."
WCPFC10,266,One CCM requested that language be added to para. 13 to make explicit that the CMR should take into account the confidentiality of the information.
WCPFC10,267,Two CCMs requested that the paragraph allowing CCMs to submit additional information against the Provisional CMR (i.e. after TCC) be retained (para. 18).
WCPFC10,268,The USA noted that allowing CCMs to submit additional information after TCC requires that a SWG be convened at the Commission meeting to review the information and if necessary revise the Provisional CMR.
WCPFC10,269,WCPFC10 adopted a new CMM for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (WCPFC-2013/DP-06 (rev ); Attachment J: CMM 2013-02).
WCPFC10,270,"WCPFC10 established in Intersessional Working Group (IWG), chaired by the USA and meeting electronically or in the margins of other meetings, to develop responses to non-compliance.    11.1.2 RFV SSPs Proposal"
WCPFC10,271,"The USA presented a draft CMM (WCPFC10-2013/DP-07) on Standards, Specifications and Procedures for the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (RFV).  The aim of the measure is to improve the reliability and cost effectiveness of the RFV.  TCC9 discussed the draft measure and agreed amendments regarding data submission procedures and standardization of fields.  Although the current draft specifies that vessel photos to be submitted for the RFV must be no older than five years, consensus could not be reached at TCC9 regarding this issue."
WCPFC10,272,FFA members noted that their comments on the draft CMM had been taken into account and that they support the proposal.
WCPFC10,273,The Chair suggested that the USA continue to consult on this proposal in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,274,"The USA tabled a revised draft (WCPFC-2013/DP-07(rev1)) noting that only one comment was received.  One CCM wished to insert language stating “periodically recommend improvements to these SSPs, including, where appropriate, standards and codes that are consistent with those used in other international fora, such as the FAO and UN/CEFACT” as an additional responsibility of the WCPFC Secretariat (as para. 15 of the RFV SSPs)."
WCPFC10,275,"WCPFC10 adopted a new CMM concerning Standards, Specifications and Procedures for the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (Attachment K: CMM 2013-03).      40 11.1.3 Unique Vessel Identifiers"
WCPFC10,276,"The USA introduced a draft CMM (WCPFC10-2013/DP-08) on implementing a unique vessel identifier (UVI).  The draft proposal, which was discussed at TCC9, would require all vessels >100 GT to obtain a UVI, require flag States to submit these UVIs for inclusion in the WCPFC RFV, and task the Commission with continuing to explore ways of assigning UVIs to all vessels on the RFV.  Based on discussions at TCC9 the exemption for non-steel hulled vessels was removed.  Other suggestions to narrow the scope of the measure to apply to vessels that fish only on the high seas were not incorporated because this would limit the application to only a subset of vessels on the RFV and undermine the value of the UVI scheme."
WCPFC10,277,Some CCMs supported the draft measure as a useful means of tracking fishing vessels that might move between tuna RFMOs.
WCPFC10,278,"Some CCMs, including FFA members, stated they are not comfortable with applying the scheme to vessels which fish solely within the waters of their own flag State.  For this reason, these CCMs wished to engage in further discussion of the draft proposal."
WCPFC10,279,Some CCMs asked that the proposal incorporate a grace period to allow time for flag States to secure UVIs for their fishing vessels.
WCPFC10,280,The Chair suggested that the USA continue to consult on this proposal in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,281,"After further consultation the USA tabled a revised proposal for discussion (WCPFC10-2013/DP-08 (rev1)).  The USA explained that in response to CCM comments the implementation date for the UVI requirements was postponed from 1 January 2015 to 1 January 2016, which is consistent with the recently adopted ICCAT measure.  In addition, the proposal contains a revised definition of the scope of the requirement which states that it applies to fishing vessels that are “authorized to be used for fishing in the Convention Area beyond the flag CCM’s area of national jurisdiction”.  The four decision points in the proposal include instructions for revising CMM 2009-01 on the WCPFC’s RFV and Authorization to Fish. CMM 2009/01 as it would be revised under the proposal is also available (WCPFC10-2013-DP08 rev1 Part2)"
WCPFC10,282,WCPFC10 adopted new requirements for a unique vessel identifier for inclusion in the CMM for the Record of Fishing Vessels and Authorisation to Fish (Attachment L:  CMM 2013-04)  11.1.4 Catch Reporting
WCPFC10,283,"FFA members introduced a draft CMM requiring vessel operators to maintain daily catch records (WCPFC10-2013/DP-09).  Daily catch logs are required in FFA members’ EEZs but this proposal aims to create an explicit requirement for such records to be kept for high seas fishing activities as well.  This is expected to improve the quality of data available for stock assessments.  Under the proposal the use of regional logsheets for recordkeeping is encouraged but not compulsory.  This proposal was assessed against the criteria for evaluating the potential impacts on SIDS (WCPFC10-2013/DP-02) but it was found that   41 since a daily catch reporting requirement is already in place in EEZs, this measure would not introduce any additional burden to SIDS."
WCPFC10,284,Some CCMs suggested that further discussion of the proposed measure was required.
WCPFC10,285,Some CCMs stressed the urgent need to put catch reporting requirements in place to help fill gaps in knowledge that lead to uncertainties in stock assessments and hinder precautionary management.
WCPFC10,286,The Chair suggested that FFA continue to consult on this proposal in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,287,FFA members reported that the proposal had been revised several times in response to CCMs’ comments and tabled it for adoption (WCPFC-2013/DP-09 (rev 4)).
WCPFC10,288,WCPFC10 adopted a new CMM on daily catch and effort reporting (Attachment M: CMM 2013-05).    11.1.5 Eastern High Seas Pocket (EHSP)
WCPFC10,289,"The Cook Islands introduced a proposal to replace CMM 2010-02 which designates as a special management area the EHSP formed by the EEZs of the Cook Islands, Kiribati and French Polynesia (WCPFC10-2013/DP-10).  The proposal would close the ESHP to fishing, ban transhipment, implement six-hour VMS entry and exit procedures, and mandate special monitoring procedures for the Secretariat.  The draft CMM is considered necessary based on recent experience with misreporting of catches and transhipment infringements in the area, and is supported by the Forum Fisheries Committee Ministerial Meeting."
WCPFC10,290,Some CCMs did not support the proposal on the basis that there may be other potential solutions to the problems encountered in the EHSP.
WCPFC10,291,Some CCMs expressed concern about jurisdictional issues posed by closing areas of the high seas.
WCPFC10,292,One CCM supported the proposal in general and welcomed its ban on high seas transhipment.
WCPFC10,293,"FFA members considered that other solutions short of a full closure of the pocket have been trialed in the past and proved to be unsuccessful.  Therefore, a simpler and more effective solution such as closing the pocket is needed."
WCPFC10,294,"One CCM suggested that since all pockets adjacent to EEZs could be havens for IUU fishing, it could agree to closing the EHSP if all such pockets were closed to fishing."
WCPFC10,295,The Chair suggested that the Cook Islands continue discussions of this proposal in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,296,The Cook Islands subsequently offered to replace the originally intended ban on fishing in the EHSP with a ban on transhipment in the EHSP.     42
WCPFC10,297,Some CCMs welcomed and supported the transhipment ban.
WCPFC10,298,"Some CCMs considered that more information on what activities take place in the EHSP should be compiled.  Acknowledging the burden created on CCMs located in close proximity to the EHSP, some of these CCMs suggested that additional measures such as controls on transshipment and enhanced monitoring (e.g. VMS verification as a condition of EHSP entry) could be discussed."
WCPFC10,299,French Polynesia noted that although one-third of the French Navy’s efforts are devoted to MCS activities in the French Polynesia EEZ this level of effort is still insufficient to alleviate concerns about the EHSP.  French Polynesia considered that WCPFC action is needed to improve the situation.
WCPFC10,300,"FFA members expressed several concerns about the EHSP including i) lack of compliance with CMMs regarding VMS, sharks and EHSP reporting requirements; ii) detrimental effects on SIDS from the lack of transhipment in port; and iii) uncontrolled fishing for South Pacific albacore.  These CCMs noted that having to deal with the MCS problems created by the EHSP represents a burden on SIDS, and considered that the best solution would be to close the EHSP."
WCPFC10,301,"Greenpeace, WWF and the Pew Charitable Trusts stressed the serious nature of the situation in the EHSP and urged WCPFC10 to close the EHSP to both fishing and transhipment."
WCPFC10,302,"Based on further consultation the Cook Islands revised the proposal for WCPFC10’s consideration (WCPFC10-2013/DP-10 (rev 1)).  In recognition of the contentious nature of the transhipment ban, the Cook Islands noted that while this was still the preferred option in the proposal, a one-year phasing out of transhipment or other alternatives could be considered.  A number of other catch and effort reporting, VMS, HSBI, non-compliance responses and Secretariat reporting components were included in this revised proposal."
WCPFC10,303,"The Cook Islands subsequently withdrew the proposal due to a lack of support from some CCMs.  However, it considered there is strong support for the phasing out of EHSP transhipment over time.  The Secretariat was asked to continue diligently monitoring the situation.  Noting the mandate from the Forum Leaders, the Cook Islands stated it will continue to work toward effective controls in the EHSP and invited CCMs to cooperate with it in this endeavor."
WCPFC10,304,France and French Polynesia expressed their gratitude to the Cook Islands for championing the proposal.  These CCMs consider that the WCPFC must strengthen its MCS tools and systems in order to improve control of activities in the EHSP and reduce the burden placed on surrounding EEZs.    11.1.6 Port State Measures
WCPFC10,305,"FFA members introduced a proposal for port State measures (WCPFC10-2013/DP-11).  This proposal is designed to fill a gap in the Commission’s ability to identify and pursue IUU vessels to non-CCM ports or ports outside of the Convention area.  The proposal introduces the concept of “vessels of interest”, promotes greater cooperation amongst   43 CCMs, builds upon subregional MCS arrangements, and would avoid placing a disproportionate burden on SIDS."
WCPFC10,306,The EU noted that it had submitted a similar proposal (WCPFC10-2013/DP-15) but it was willing to consider the FFA proposal as the basis for the WCPFC port State measure.
WCPFC10,307,The Chair instructed CCMs to discuss the proposal in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,308,FFA members reported that the proposal had gone through three revisions (WCPFC10-2013/DP-11 (rev 3)) but there was still no consensus on its adoption.  These CCMs stated their intention to use the revised proposal as the basis for discussion of a port state measure at TCC10 and WCPFC11.
WCPFC10,309,Some CCMs expressed their disappointment that WCPFC10 could not adopt a port state measure but looked forward to further discussions next year.
WCPFC10,310,"One CCM stated that delicate domestic discussions are underway concerning port state issues and thus while it is not in position to agree port state measures this year, it hopes to participate in a more constructive discussion next year.    11.1.7 Sharks"
WCPFC10,311,"The EU presented its proposal on a no-retention measure for silky sharks (WCPFC10-2013/DP-17).  While the EU stated its support for the FFA proposal for a revised shark CMM, it considered that a specific measure is necessary to conserve and manage silky sharks given the findings of SC9 that the stock is overfished and overfishing is occurring."
WCPFC10,312,One CCM stated it could support the draft CMM if the prohibition on sale of silky sharks was removed.
WCPFC10,313,"FFA members generally supported the proposal but noted that sharks that are dead when brought to the vessel will be discarded and therefore wasted.  Furthermore, the measure does not assist in reducing the number of silky sharks brought to the vessel in the first place and therefore other mitigation measures are required."
WCPFC10,314,The Chair requested that the EU continue discussions on the silky shark CMM in the margins of WCPFC10.
WCPFC10,315,The EU subsequently tabled a revised proposal with the prohibition on sale of silky sharks removed (WCPFC10-2013/DP-17 (rev 1)).
WCPFC10,316,"Some CCMs stated that they reluctantly supported the proposed measure because they considered the scientific support for such a measure to be not absolutely clear. These CCMs requested that the text be re-worded to apply only to silky sharks caught in the WCPF Convention Area because the species is allowed to be taken in the IATTC Convention Area.  Furthermore, these CCMs requested text be added to the effect that the measure would be amended on the basis of the most recent stock assessment advice."
WCPFC10,317,"Some CCMs, while supporting the proposal, considered that a delayed implementation date of 1 July 2014 would be preferred.     44"
WCPFC10,318,One CCM asked whether there would be any provision in the measure to provide implementation assistance to national observer programmes.
WCPFC10,319,"WCPFC10 adopted a new CMM on no-retention of silky sharks which included amendments to i) restrict the scope to silky sharks caught in the WCPF Convention Area, ii) amend the measure based on the latest stock assessment results, and iii) delay implementation of the proposal until 1 July 2014 (Attachment N: CMM 2013-08)."
WCPFC10,320,The EU presented its proposal to require that all sharks be landed with their fins naturally attached (WCPFC10-2013/DP-16).  The EU noted that this proposal is consistent with its domestic policy but may need to be modified to read “fins naturally attached to the whole carcass” in order to prevent the skinning of sharks onboard.  The EU expressed a willingness to find common ground between this proposal and the FFA’s proposal for shark fins to be naturally attached.
WCPFC10,321,One CCM supported the EU’s proposal on the basis that it has both scientific and conservation benefits.
WCPFC10,322,The EU subsequently stated that it had tabled a revision to its proposal (WCPFC10-2013/DP-16 (rev 1)) but considered that support for the proposal was lacking given discussions underway concerning the requirement to land sharks with their fins attached under the FFA shark proposal.  The EU reaffirmed its commitment to seeing a fins-attached requirement established in all tuna RFMOs.
WCPFC10,323,"FFA members presented a proposal for a revised shark CMM (WCPFC10-2013/DP-12).  The objective of the proposal was to strengthen shark conservation and incorporate information presented at SC9 by requiring catch and discard reporting by species, requiring that fins remain naturally attached until landing, banning wire leaders and shark lines, and requiring management plans and limits on shark catches in shark-targeted fisheries."
WCPFC10,324,Some CCMs expressed qualified support for the proposal but wished to engage in further discussion of details.
WCPFC10,325,One CCM opposed the proposal on the basis that it would have adverse impacts on crew safety.
WCPFC10,326,The Chair asked that interested CCMs discuss the draft CMM in a small working group which Palau offered to lead.
WCPFC10,327,"Palau subsequently tabled a revised draft measure (WCPFC10-2013/DP-12 (rev 9)) but stated that consensus on a comprehensive measure could not be reached.  The revised text removed the provisions for which there was no consensus and called for i) an integrated and comprehensive shark CMM to be developed in 2014, and ii) for fisheries that target sharks to develop management plans."
WCPFC10,328,"One CCM raised a number of issues with the proposed text including questions about the preambular wording, the definition of ‘viscera’, the ability to develop appropriate mitigation measures in the specified timeframe without any specific proposals, and the requirement to apply a purse seine shark handling handbook which are not developed.    45 Given the number of outstanding concerns, this CCM stated that it could not support the current draft proposal."
WCPFC10,329,Some CCM’s pointed out that it was not clear how the revised proposal tracked the existing shark CMM (CMM 2010-07).
WCPFC10,330,Palau withdrew the proposal pending further consideration next year.  It suggested that the SC investigate shark bycatch mitigation methods in 2014 and that WCPFC11 develop an integrated and comprehensive shark CMM.  Palau invited the Commission to adopt this as a recommendation by consensus.
WCPFC10,331,"While many CCM’s supported Palau’s proposal, there was not consensus to adopt it as a Commission recommendation.    11.1.8 Proposal on Fisheries Access Agreements"
WCPFC10,332,"The EU presented a proposal on fisheries and access agreements information (WCPFC10-2013/DP-14).  Noting that this proposal was also tabled at WCPFC9, the EU considered that making fishing agreements public is extremely important for transparency in the region."
WCPFC10,333,One CCM supported the proposal on the grounds that it would increase transparency.
WCPFC10,334,One CCM expressed concerns about how the required information could be submitted to the Secretariat in cases of short-term or spur of the moment fishing agreements.
WCPFC10,335,FFA members stated that they do not support the proposal because some of the information is commercially sensitive and cannot be released.
WCPFC10,336,There was no further discussion of this proposal at WCPFC10.    11.1.9 Pacific Bluefin Tuna (PBF)
WCPFC10,337,A draft CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna (WCPFC10-2013/27) was discussed under Agenda Item 9 (Northern Committee).    11.1.10 South Pacific Albacore
WCPFC10,338,"New Zealand, on behalf of some FFA members, presented a draft of a revised CMM for South Pacific albacore (WCPFC10-2013/DP-34).  Management of this fishery is considered critical to SIDS’ domestic longline industries and it was noted with concern that catches have doubled in the last decade despite the adoption of CMMs in 2005 and 2010 designed to limit entry.  The proposed CMM includes provisions to deter the continuing influx of vessels to albacore fishing grounds south of the equator, limits on catches in the high seas and overlap areas to 2006-2010 levels, and zone-based catch limits for CCMs which prevent growth in some fisheries but allow for it in others.      46"
WCPFC10,339,Some CCMs expressed concerns about the limits on the number of fishing vessels being defined relative to the equator rather than 20oS as in the previous measures.  One CCM also questioned the basis for limiting catches to 2006-2010 levels and suggested that catch limits should be based on a new stock assessment.
WCPFC10,340,"Several CCMs including FFA members and Participating Territories, some of whom are economically dependent on South Pacific albacore, supported the proposal."
WCPFC10,341,FFA members called for the information paper on South Pacific albacore (WCPCFC10-2013/IP-02) to be updated each year.
WCPFC10,342,Some CCMs considered that the northern boundary for the CMM should be 10oS rather than the equator.
WCPFC10,343,Some CCMs suggested that in order to avoid restricting troll fisheries the CMM should explicitly define to which gear types and fleets any high seas vessel and catch limits would apply.
WCPFC10,344,"Based on consultations held during WCPFC10, New Zealand tabled a revised proposal (WCPFC10-2013/DP-34 (rev 3))."
WCPFC10,345,"China stated that although it could not support the revised draft CMM for South Pacific albacore, as of September 2013 the Fisheries Administration of China has implemented a cap of 400 China-flagged vessels authorized to target South Pacific albacore.  China expressed a willingness to work toward a revised CMM for South Pacific albacore at WCPFC11 and will continue to work with SIDS to assist in developing their domestic longline fisheries.  China requested that a new stock assessment for South Pacific albacore be conducted as soon as possible."
WCPFC10,346,"New Zealand expressed its disappointment that WCPFC10 could not adopt a new CMM for South Pacific albacore, particularly as some SIDS have already taken actions such as lowering their catch levels to ensure the viability of the stock.  While China’s cap on the number of vessels was welcomed, New Zealand noted that this would not remedy existing over-capacity in the fishery."
WCPFC10,347,"FFA members stated that South Pacific albacore is a mainstay for many of their domestic longline fisheries but it does not receive the attention it deserves within the WCPFC.  In discussions at WCPFC10 good progress was made toward reducing the increasing trends in catch and effort, but this progress was halted when high seas and overlap area catch limits were not supported.  China’s transparency regarding its cap of 400 vessels is appreciated, and China’s need to develop its own shipbuilding and fishing industries, and provide food security for its own people, is recognized.  Nevertheless, SIDS cannot compete with heavily subsidized fleets from China and if the current situation continues catch rates will decline below the point of economic viability for SIDS’s fleets.  FFA members consider that the Commission’s inaction with regard to South Pacific albacore represents a significant disproportionate burden on SIDS and is in direct conflict with Article 30 of the Convention.  These CCMs look forward to cooperating with China on South Pacific albacore issues in 2014 and to support for a new South Pacific albacore CMM at WCPFC11.      47"
WCPFC10,348,One CCM acknowledged the initial step taken by China to control capacity but expressed disappointment that no new or interim CMM could be agreed by WCPFC10.  This CCM considered that there is an urgent need to strengthen the management of the South Pacific albacore fishery and expressed its commitment to develop a new CMM for WCPFC11.
WCPFC10,349,The Cook Islands echoed the position of FFA members and noted the importance of controlling South Pacific albacore catch and effort on the high seas in order to reduce the potential for encroachment into the Cook Islands EEZ.    11.1.11 FFA Draft CMM on Criteria for Consideration of CMM Proposals
WCPFC10,350,The Chair noted that FFA members tabled a proposed CMM requiring that the impact of conservation and management proposals on SIDS be assessed and the results be attached in the form of explanatory note to the draft proposal (WCPFC10-2013/DP-35) (also see Agenda Item 3.3).
WCPFC10,351,"RMI, on behalf of FFA members, led consultations with CCMs on this proposal at WCPFC10 and tabled a revised draft for discussion (WCPFC10-2013/DP-35 (rev 3)).  RMI explained that the draft CMM was designed to incorporate Article 30 of the Convention into the decision-making process of the Commission."
WCPFC10,352,Japan referred to its presentation on its small fishing communities and stated its desire to reflect those issues in the CMM.  It proposed to replace references to “SIDS” with references to “CCMs” or to add references to “small fishing communities of non-SIDS”.
WCPFC10,353,FFA members responded that to do so would be inconsistent with Article 30 of the Convention as it specifically refers to SIDS.
WCPFC10,354,One CCM questioned how the assessment of the impact of conservation and management proposals on SIDS should be carried out.
WCPFC10,355,"One CCM considered that it, like many other CCMs, take on burdens as a result of cooperating with the Commission in responsible fisheries management.  Therefore, the question is not whether burdens are being incurred but rather whether they are appropriately apportioned among CCMs.  This CCM shared FFA’s concern for robust and profitable fishing industries in Pacific island countries and asked that the draft CMM use terminology inclusive of Participating Territories as they share many of the same characteristics as SIDS."
WCPFC10,356,One CCM noted that the first option should be to seek to avoid placing a disproportionate burden on SIDS.
WCPFC10,357,FFA members stated their view that the references in the WCPF Convention to SIDS include Participating Territories.  They also reminded CCMs that the requirements contained in the draft CMM already exist in the Convention and are simply being formulated as a checklist to be used in an assessment of impacts and mitigation options.
WCPFC10,358,"After further discussions in the margins of WCPFC10, FFA members tabled a revised draft CMM (WCPFC10-2013/DP-35 (rev 4)).  This draft contained wording which would   48 require new proposals to consider which CCMs the proposal would impact and in which ways."
WCPFC10,359,Japan stated that it could accept the revised draft if the Commission in parallel adopted a statement that similar consideration would be given to small fishing communities in non-SIDS.
WCPFC10,360,WCPFC10 adopted a new CMM on criteria for consideration of the impact of conservation and management proposals on SIDS and Participating Territories (Attachment O:  CMM 2013-06).
WCPFC10,361,WCPFC10 agreed that similar consideration shall be given to small fishing communities of non-SIDS CCMs.    11.1.12 FFA Draft CMM on Special Requirements of SIDS and Territories
WCPFC10,362,The Chair noted that FFA members tabled a proposed CMM requiring the Commission to give full consideration to the special requirements of SIDS (WCPFC10-2013/DP-36) (also see Agenda Item 3.3).
WCPFC10,363,"RMI, on behalf of FFA members, led consultations with CCMs on this proposal at WCPFC10 and tabled a revised draft (WCPFC10-2013/DP-36 (rev 3)).  The aim of the proposal is to operationalize Article 30 of the WCPF Convention by turning principles into actions.  It was noted that the revised proposal had removed contentious text and represented a significant compromise."
WCPFC10,364,"FFA members urged WCPFC10 to endorse the proposal as an international benchmark in recognizing the aspirations of SIDS.  In addition to operationalizing the requirements of Article 30 of the WCPF Convention, these CCMs considered that the proposed measure also reflects the intent of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement and the Barbados Programme of Action, and would support the goals of genuine and enduring partnerships under the upcoming UN Conference on SIDS in Samoa.  FFA members stated that the measure was necessary to give greater attention to supporting local and small-scale fleets by striking a balance in the benefits of the fishery to developed and developing States."
WCPFC10,365,"Some CCMs expressed support for the draft CMM stating that it is useful in identifying priorities for cooperation and assistance in capacity building, technology transfer, fisheries management, MCS and domestic industry development.  Some of these CCMs noted that they already provide significant support to SIDS in these areas."
WCPFC10,366,"Some CCMs, while supporting the general concept, expressed concerns about the extent to which the measure created obligations for assistance.  These CCMs considered that such obligations could lead to non-compliances if, for example, economic conditions lead to changing budgets or national initiatives do not align with the priorities in the measure."
WCPFC10,367,"The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), on behalf of Guam and American Samoa, articulated its support for the draft measure and noted that as Participating Territories they also have aspirations for development.      49"
WCPFC10,368,RMI agreed to conduct further consultations and returned with a revised draft CMM (WCPFC-2013/DP-36 (rev 4)).  The concerns of some CCMs about the creation of obligations were addressed by including language stating that developed CCMs will endeavour to cooperate.  Other concerns about trade issues were addressed by specifying that trade barriers that are not consistent with international laws and regulations should be eliminated.
WCPFC10,369,WCPFC10 adopted a new CMM operationalizing the special requirements of SIDS and territories (Attachment P:  CMM 2013-07).    11.2 Report by PNA Members on the Vessel Day Scheme
WCPFC10,370,The Chair recalled that PNA members informed WCPFC8 that they would no longer be presenting reports on the Vessel Day Scheme to the Commission.  Future Commission meeting agendas will take note of this.    AGENDA  ITEM  12  -  AD HOC TASK GROUP-DATA (AHTG-Data) 12.1 New Chairperson
WCPFC10,371,The Chair called for nominations for a Chair of the AHTG-Data but none were forthcoming.    12.2 Work Plan for 2014 and 2015
WCPFC10,372,The Chair noted that the work of this subsidiary body would not progress without a chair to lead it.    AGENDA  ITEM  13  -  REPORT OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE (FAC) 13.1 Budget Approval for 2014 and Indicative Budgets for 2015 and 2016
WCPFC10,373,"The report of the seventh meeting of the FAC, including a proposed Commission budget for 2014 in the amount of $7,320,178 US, was tabled for WCPFC10’s approval (WCPFC10-2013/25)."
WCPFC10,374,"One CCM noted, and the Secretariat confirmed, that the second line in Note 6 should be deleted (i.e. “inclusion for 2014/15 subject to WCPFC10 decision”)."
WCPFC10,375,WCPFC10 adopted the summary report and recommendations of FAC7 (WCPFC10-2013/25).  (Attachment Q)    50 AGENDA  ITEM  14  -  ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS 14.1 Future Structure of the Commission’s Meeting
WCPFC10,376,The Chair invited WCPFC10 to consider the Secretariat’s previous paper on Commission meeting arrangements (WCPFC9-2012/21).
WCPFC10,377,This item was not discussed at WCPFC10.   14.2 Strategic Plan
WCPFC10,378,The Executive Director introduced an updated version of the Commission’s Strategic Plan (WCPFC10-2013/24).  This document was first tabled for the Commission’s consideration at WCPFC6 as part of the report of the FAC.  At WCPFC9 it was recommended to move this item from the FAC to the Commission’s agenda.  The Secretariat has updated the document to reflect the work plans developed at SC9 and TCC9.
WCPFC10,379,FFA members considered that the plan functions as more of a short-term business plan than as a forward-looking vision of the Commission’s aspirations on stock status and the flows of benefits from the fisheries.  These CCMs acknowledged that strategic goals will take time to develop but stated that the strategic plan can be a focal point for this type of constructive debate.
WCPFC10,380,The Executive Director remarked that a strategic plan as called for by FFA members involves policy development and should be led by CCMs rather than by the Secretariat.
WCPFC10,381,FFA members requested that the Secretariat consider this matter intersessionally and report back to WCPFC11.    14.3 Election of Officers
WCPFC10,382,The Chair reminded WCPFC10 that TCC9 recommended Rhea Moss-Christian (FSM) to continue as Chair of the TCC.
WCPFC10,383,Several CCMs spoke in appreciation of the excellent work of Ms Moss-Christian as TCC Chair.
WCPFC10,384,WCPFC10 accepted the nomination of TCC9 and confirmed Rhea Moss-Christian as Chair of the TCC.
WCPFC10,385,Philip Lens (PNG) was nominated to chair the IWG-ROP.
WCPFC10,386,WCPFC10 confirmed Philip Lens as Chair of the IWG-ROP.
WCPFC10,387,"The Chair noted that the Chair of the FAC, Moses Amos (Vanuatu) is taking up a new position and cannot continue in his role as chair.  Mr Amos was thanked for his efforts on behalf of the FAC."
WCPFC10,388,Dr Paul Callaghan (USA) was nominated to chair the FAC.   51
WCPFC10,389,WCPFC10 confirmed Dr Paul Callaghan as Chair of the FAC.
WCPFC10,390,"The Chair reminded WCPFC10 that the positions of SC Vice-Chair, FAC Vice-Chair and AHTG-Data Chair are vacant and requested that CCMs consider nominations intersessionally.    14.4 Future Meetings"
WCPFC10,391,"The Chair announced that WCPFC11 will be held in Apia, Samoa and WCPFC12 will be held in Bali, Indonesia."
WCPFC10,392,"Samoa expressed its appreciation to Indonesia for allowing Samoa to host WCPFC11.  As Samoa will be the venue for the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States on 1-4 September 2014, hosting WCPFC11 will take advantage of the facilities being constructed for this conference before they are dismantled in December 2014.  Samoa promised a warm welcome to all WCPFC11 participants."
WCPFC10,393,"The Executive Director announced the dates of WCPFC meetings in 2014 as follows:  o SC10 to be held in Majuro, RMI from 6-14 August o TCC10 to be held in Pohnpei, FSM from 25-30 September o WCPFC11 to be held in Apia, Samoa from 1-5 December"
WCPFC10,394,Japan noted that dates for NC10 will be set later but confirmed that the meeting is typically held in the first week of September in Japan.
WCPFC10,395,"Japan asked that the Commission consider a randomized, rather than alphabetical, seating arrangement for future meetings.    AGENDA  ITEM  15  -  OTHER MATTERS  15.1 Issues Raised by Participants"
WCPFC10,396,"The CITES Secretariat noted that five shark species (porbeagle, oceanic whitetip, and scalloped, smooth and great hammerhead sharks), as well as both manta ray species were listed on CITES Appendix II at the last Conference of the Parties to CITES in March 2013.  These listings, which will take effect on 14 September 2014, do not prohibit international trade but require strict regulation and control to avoid utilization incompatible with these species’ survival.  After the listings take effect international trade in these species will require CITES permits and certificates confirming they were harvested legally and sustainably.  Acknowledging that national and regional fishery management agencies and organizations have the main responsibility for managing fishery resources, the CITES Secretariat considered that CITES can complement this by encouraging legal and sustainable fishing practices.  The CITES Secretariat is committed to assisting CITES parties with implementation and has received 1.2 million Euros from the EU to support joint actions with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.  These actions   52 will be targeted toward regional fisheries management organizations and developing countries to strengthen scientific, institutional or enforcement capacities.  The CITES Secretariat offered to collaborate with the WCPFC through a dedicated discussion of issues and species of common interest at a future session of the Commission."
WCPFC10,397,The Chair welcomed the suggestion from the CITES Secretariat and noted that the WCPFC Secretariat would consult with the CITES Secretariat on these issues.
WCPFC10,398,"A representative of the University of the South Pacific announced that under its revised strategic plan the university will offer new undergraduate and postgraduate programmes designed to support the tuna industry.  The programmes will focus on capacity building and research and development, and will work with Council of Regional Organizations of the Pacific (CROP) agencies.    15.2 Contract Term for the Executive Director"
WCPFC10,399,"The Chair noted that a Heads of Delegation meeting was convened in the margins of WCPFC10 to discuss the contract arrangements for the Executive Director.  The incumbent Executive Director’s initial four-year term commenced on 26th September 2010 and will therefore expire on 25 September 2014, which is during the 2014 intersessional period."
WCPFC10,400,"WCPFC10 noted the following outcomes of the Heads of Delegation meeting:    i. The Commission is happy with the Executive Director’s performance and is prepared to reappoint him to a further term of four years; ii. The Chair of the Commission is empowered to inform the Executive Director of this position and request that should he decide not to complete the four year term, that the Executive Director give the Commission adequate notice so as to allow for the necessary arrangements of recruitment and appointment of a replacement Executive Director; iii. The current Commission Rules and Procedures are not adequate regarding procedures for the re-appointment of the Executive Director and related matters.  Work should be undertaken during 2014, with a view to bringing a proposal to WCPFC11 that will include:   a. reviewing existing regulations to see where there might be clarity needed with respect to the relationship between the Executive Director and the Chair; b. developing a process for the performance evaluation of the Executive Director; and  c. outlining a process for the contract negotiation for the Executive Director."
WCPFC10,401,"The Chair informed WCPFC10 that he had conveyed the four-year reappointment offer to the Executive Director, and noted that the Executive Director indicated that he would consider it and inform the Chair of his decision as soon as possible.  The Chair stated that he would inform CCMs of the Executive Director’s decision once it is received.      53 AGENDA  ITEM  16  -  SUMMARY REPORT"
WCPFC10,402,"A summary report was prepared by the rapporteur and the Secretariat, and circulated to CCMs for comment.  AGENDA  ITEM  17  -  CLOSE OF MEETING"
WCPFC10,403,"The Chair expressed the Commission’s sincere appreciation to Dr Martin Tsamenyi who will step down as WCPFC Legal Advisor after WCPFC10.  As a symbol of their heartfelt thanks, the Chair and the Secretariat presented Dr Tsamenyi with an Akubra hat."
WCPFC10,404,"Fiji recognized Dr Tsamenyi’s unparalleled contributions to capacity building in the region, as demonstrated by his long history of participation in the formation and operation of the WCPFC, his services to regional universities, and his authorship of key national fisheries legislation, most recently in Fiji."
WCPFC10,405,The Cook Islands called for a moment of silence in remembrance of Navy Epati and Colin Brown who passed away in 2013.  Both men will be sorely missed not only for their significant contributions to the work of the Commission but also for their unique and likeable characters.
WCPFC10,406,Indonesia stated that it intended to prioritize the protection of fish workers and their rights and to improve working conditions on WCPFC authorized vessels by developing a CMM for discussion at WCPFC11.
WCPFC10,407,"FFA members expressed their satisfaction with the two new CMMs regarding the rights of SIDS and thanked the Chair for his leadership.  FFA members wished to clarify that they consider the use of the term SIDS to include WCPFC Participating Territories.  However, FFA members stated their grave concern regarding a growing trend, evidenced by the agreement language proposed by Japan in relation to its coastal communities and the insertion of Indonesia in the SIDS exemptions from the capacity measure, to equating these countries’ social and economic challenges to those of SIDS.  The special legal status of SIDS under the WCPF Convention and many other international legal instruments must be respected, and not undermined by placing other groups at the same level."
WCPFC10,408,"The Chair thanked the Secretariat for their excellent support of the meeting and closed WCPFC10 at 18:20 on Friday, 6 December 2013."
WCPFC11,1,"The Eleventh Regular Session of the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC11) took place from 1-5 December 2014 at Apia, Samoa."
WCPFC11,2,"The following Members, and Participating Territories  attended WCPFC11: American Samoa, Australia, Canada, the People’s Republic of China, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), the Cook Islands, the European Union (EU), the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Fiji, France, French Polynesia, Guam, Indonesia, Japan, Kiribati, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, , Papua New Guinea (PNG), the Philippines, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Chinese Taipei, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, the United States of America (USA), and Vanuatu."
WCPFC11,3,"The following non-party countries attended WCPFC11 as Cooperating Non-Members (CNMs): Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam. Liberia participated at WCPFC11 as an observer."
WCPFC11,4,"Observers from the following governmental and inter-governmental organizations attended WCPFC11: Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIF), the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA), the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), the Secretariat for the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), the United Nations Environment Programme, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).  4"
WCPFC11,5,"Observers from the following non-governmental organizations attended WCPFC11: American Albacore Fishing Foundation, American Fisheries Research Foundation, American Tunaboat Association, Birdlife International, Conservation International, Earth Island Institute, Environment Hawaii, Greenpeace, International Environmental Law Project,, International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF), the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), Organization for the Promotion of Responsible Tuna Fisheries (OPRT), Pacific Islands Tuna Industry Association (PITIA), the Pew Charitable Trusts, Tautai O-Samoa Longline & Fishing Association, the United States-Japan Research Institute, and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)."
WCPFC11,6, A list of all participants is attached as Attachment A.  1.1 Welcoming Addresses
WCPFC11,7,"Faalavaau M. Perina Jacqueline Sila, government of Samoa, welcomed the Prime Minister of Samoa and Ministers of the government of Samoa, the WCPFC Chair, Dr Charles Karnella, the Interim-Executive Director, Dr Lara Manarangi-Trott, and delegations."
WCPFC11,8,A benediction was offered by Reverend Afamasaga Mautofu Fuimaono.
WCPFC11,9,"On behalf of the government and people of Samoa, the Prime Minister of Samoa, the Honourable Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi, gave a warm welcome to attendees of this year’s annual session of the WCPFC (see Attachment B). He noted that the meeting of WCPFC11 was opportune, after the success of the 3rd UN International Conference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in Samoa in September, which saw more than 130 countries and 100 organizations in attendance at the purpose-built and refurbished Faleata Sports Complex. The Prime Minister noted the importance Samoans place on sustainable management and strategic utilisation of their limited resources, and emphasized that fisheries were a main economic development opportunity available to SIDS. The Prime Minister urged participants to work together in the spirit of genuine and durable partnerships to ensure Pacific fish stocks remain healthy for current and future generations, including agreeing a strengthened measure for South Pacific albacore, a key target stock for Pacific islanders. The Prime Minister commented that compliance with CMMs and timely reporting remained important issues and noted that IUU fishing continues to threaten and undermine fisheries conservation efforts. Hard decisions needed to be made to ensure the long term conservation and systematic use of highly migratory fish stocks in the region, and to avoid mistakes made elsewhere in overexploiting fish stocks. The Prime Minister of Samoa emphasized that Samoa wished to make available its facilities in the future and wished delegates well in their deliberations."
WCPFC11,10,"The Chair thanked the Prime Minster of Samoa for his words of wisdom. He acknowledged the attendance at WCPFC11 of ministers and dignitaries, including The Hon. Prime Minister of Samoa Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi, the Hon. Ulu o Tokelau Kuresa Nasau, the Hon. Deputy Prime Minister of Samoa Fonotoe Nuafesili Pierre Lauofo, Ministers of the Cabinet, Government of Samoa, the Hon. Elisala Pita, Minister for Works and Natural Resources, Tuvalu, the Hon.

Luwalhati Antonino, Chair of Mindanao Development Authority, Philippines, His Excellency Shane Jones, Ambassador for Pacific Economic Development, New Zealand. 5  The Chair also acknowledged Interim-Executive Director of the WCPFC, Dr Lara Manarangi-Trott, FFA Director General, James Movick and PNA Chief Executive Officer, Dr Transform Aqorau, WCPFC Secretariat staff, Reverend Afamasaga Mautofu Fuimaono, police, security and volunteers. The Chair remarked on the hospitality shown by Samoa and the excellent facilities. He noted that the Commission would this week continue the process of helping ensure that highly migratory marine fish species are properly managed so they will be available for participants’ descendants and their descendants, and that the Commission has to come together and work as partners and make accommodations on each side."
WCPFC11,11,The Chair opened the meeting at 10 AM on 1 December 2014. 1.2 Adoption of agenda
WCPFC11,12,"The Chair advised that three suggested changes to the agenda were discussed at the Heads of Delegation meeting on 30 November: moving the Northern Committee (NC) deliberations (8.1) to Tuesday morning, to allow the NC Chair to meet his travel obligations; the Cook Islands withdrawing its proposal on EHSP (WCPFC11-2014-DP18) which removed Agenda item 10.10 from the agenda; and a report on the Kobe process added to the agenda at"
WCPFC11,14,"The Interim- Executive Director and Compliance Manager, Dr Lara Manarangi-Trott, identified the Secretariat staff in attendance at WCPFC11: Finance and Administration Manager Aaron Nighswander; Science Manager Dr SungKwon Soh; Assistant Compliance Manager 'Ana Taholo; Regional Observer Programme (ROP) Coordinator Karl Staisch; Information, Communication and Technology Manager Sam Taufao; Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) Manager Albert Carlot; Assistant Science Manager Anthony Beeching, GEF ABNJ Tuna Project Technical Coordinator-Sharks and Bycatch Dr Shelley Clarke, project management consultant Kerry Smith, Administrative Officer Lucille Martinez, Executive Assistant Arlene Takesy. In addition to Secretariat staff, participants included staff from SPC-OFP Dr John Hampton, Dr Shelton Harley, Dr Graeme Pilling and Dr Robert Scott, Third Management Objectives Workshop Facilitator Ian Cartwright, Rapporteur Dr Jane Broweleit, the five shortlisted interview candidates for the Executive Director position –Peter Flewelling, Feleti P. Teo, Dr Sachiko Tsuji and Dr David Wilson along with Dr SungKwon Soh - and the many Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Fisheries and Faleata Sports Complex staff helping the Secretariat with the meeting arrangements."
WCPFC11,15,"It was noted that David Angyal, WCPFC Legal Advisor, had taken ill on the journey to Samoa and was in hospital in Honolulu. He would not be in attendance at WCPFC11 and wishes for his speedy recovery were offered."
WCPFC11,16,"The Interim-Executive Director noted logistical and administrative arrangements in place to support the meeting, including proposed times for a PNA, SPC, ISSF side meeting and a GEF ABNJ Sharks and Bycatch Consultation Committee Meeting, along with an evening function on 1 December 2014 at the invitation of the Prime Minister of Samoa. Interviews 6  to select the new WCPFC Executive Director were scheduled for the afternoon of 2 December 2014, the second day of the meeting. Heads of delegations of Members and Participating Territories only would participate in those interviews."
WCPFC11,17,"The Chair reminded member delegations to ensure the Secretariat received their credentials, to enable them to participate in negotiations. The Secretariat advised on facilities and processes for booking side rooms, power, printing and computer facilities and document management, and update arrangements for the public website and in-house meeting server.  1.3.1  Small working groups"
WCPFC11,18,"The Chair informed WCPFC11 of his intention to continue the process used at recent meetings to introduce proposals early in the meeting to be worked on in small groups in the margins of the meeting. Issues related to the tropical tuna measure, including those within the measure which were scheduled to be addressed this year, as well as proposals for amendments to the measure, would be worked on as a single item in a small working group so as to not take up extensive amounts of time at the cost of time in plenary. Other small working groups would advance consideration of CNM applications, the Compliance Monitoring Review process, and responses to non-compliance.   AGENDA  ITEM  2  -  MEMBERSHIP AND OTHER APPLICATIONS 2.1 Status of the Convention"
WCPFC11,19,"After thanking the government and people of Samoa for their hosting of WCPFC11, and the WCPFC Secretariat for their hard work preparing the meeting, the depository of the Convention, New Zealand, advised WCPFC11 that since its last report to the tenth regular session of the Commission in December 2013, New Zealand has not received notification of any instruments of ratification or accession to the Convention (WCPFC11-2014-06). 2.2 Applications for Observer status"
WCPFC11,20,"The Chair noted that an application for observer status from Liberia was discussed at the Heads of Delegation meeting on 30 November, without objection."
WCPFC11,21,WCPFC11 agreed to approve the application for observer status from Liberia for this meeting. 2.3 Applications for Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) status 2.3.1 TCC10 advice and recommendations and updates from Secretariat
WCPFC11,22,"The TCC Chair, Rhea Moss-Christian noted that TCC had considered eight CNM applications for Cooperating Non-Member status for 2015, from Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Senegal, Thailand and Vietnam (WCPFC11-2014-08). A ninth application, from Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), was received after the conclusion of TCC10. Ecuador, El Salvador and Vietnam attended TCC10. Belize had 7  advised WCPFC that they do not wish to be considered for Cooperating Non-Member renewal in 2015."
WCPFC11,23,"TCC10 recommended that all eight applications be forwarded to WCPFC11 and that WCPFC11 take into consideration the Compliance Status of all CNM applicants in making its decision on the CNM applications and participatory rights (para 26(iv)). Some Members, CNMs and Participating Territories (CCMs) at TCC10 recommended that WCPFC11 agree that, in addition to this year’s financial contribution, CNMs should be required to make any past financial contributions that remain outstanding (para 26(vi)). A third recommendation is that if conditional grants of cooperating non-member status are given, that there be a clear process for how the final determination will be made (para 26(vii)). TCC10 noted that three CNM applicants (Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico) have expressed an interest in becoming full members and recommends that WCPFC11 consider whether to invite them to become Members (para 26(viii))."
WCPFC11,24,"Of the eight applications for CNM status for 2015 (Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Senegal, Thailand and Vietnam), gaps were noted for Mexico, Panama, Senegal, Thailand and Vietnam, as follows:  Mexico: TCC10 noted there was no commitment made to a financial contribution, high seas boarding and inspection; Mexico does not have vessels operating in the area; SPC reports data gaps.   Panama: submitted its Annual Reports 1 and 2 during TCC, so were not adequately assessed; were encouraged to submit earlier in future years; SPC receives some transshipment data, but reports that there may be gaps.  Senegal: made no commitment to provide a financial contribution.  Thailand: submits some transshipment data, but there may be gaps.  Vietnam: is continuing to improve its data submission, but there may be gaps."
WCPFC11,25,"DPRK’s application was not considered by TCC10. Since TCC10, data and information from Liberia, Senegal and DPRK has been received. DPRK provided some fishery-specific data. Additional information was made available to CCMs through the secure section of the WCPFC website."
WCPFC11,26,"Japan stated that the over capacity problem in the purse seine fishery is one of the biggest problems for this Commission and CNMs should also seriously consider this. At WCPFC10, Japan had advised of the possible construction of 10 large purse seine vessels in Vietnam and requested Vietnam to oversee the ship building activities in its country. Japan also reminded the Commission that Vietnam had promised to convey the Commission’s concerns on overcapacity issue to its home government and report back and asked Vietnam to update the Commission on the situation in its country."
WCPFC11,27,"One CCM acknowledged Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico’s requests for membership, thanked them for their interest and highlighted that in the upcoming consideration of participatory rights, WCPFC shouldn’t allow excess capacity into the region."
WCPFC11,28,"FFA members noted that two applications were submitted late. They stated that complete applications, in the template provided by the Secretariat, should be submitted on time. FFA members also supported TCC10's recommendation that compliance status should be taken into account in consideration of the granting of CNM status and participatory rights, and that CNMs should submit Annual Reports on time. FFA members noted that each year gaps have been noted in meeting the CNM criteria, yet CNM status is granted. Where 8  information is not provided, the application is incomplete and FFA members cannot agree to grant those applicants CNM status, though they are open to a 'conditional acceptance', provided the process for allowing CNM status intersessionally is clear, such as: (i) identifying the information/requirement gap; (ii) information/requirement is to be met or provided to the Executive Director by a certain date; (iii) the Executive Director advises CCMs and forwards the advice/information as appropriate; (iv) unless an objection is received by a certain date, conditional acceptance is lifted and CNM status is allowed; and (v) the Executive Director confirms this to all CCMs. FFA added that in setting dates under the process outlined above, the Commission should be flexible, depending on the magnitude and nature of the outstanding information."
WCPFC11,29,"FFA members noted that a number of CNMs have not paid their assessed contributions, including for 2011-2014. FFA members stated that CNMs are to pay a contribution to the Commission which is 50% of the amount that would be payable if the CNM was a member, as agreed at WCPFC7. In 2014, the assessed contributions for five of the eight CNMs were less than the assessed contribution of any of the SIDS; those for the other three CNMs were still far less than those for several SIDS. Such contributions are to be used to reduce the assessed contributions in the year following receipt. FFA members expressed concern that some CNMs are failing to provide their assessed contributions and requested that CNM applicants with outstanding financial contributions make these payments at the earliest opportunity. If the contributions are not made at this meeting, FFA members stated they will not accept these CNM applications, though they would allow a conditional acceptance provided contributions are made by a certain date."
WCPFC11,30,"The Chair queried the concept of conditional approval and asked how it would work, if a statement would be rendered along the lines of “the Commission approves CNM status for X country pending receipt of the following…”"
WCPFC11,31,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA, recalled that last year a conditional acceptance status was provisional for Mexico and DPRK. A process where a status was offered provisionally, pending outstanding contributions being paid, would be acceptable."
WCPFC11,32,"The EU sought further clarification from FFA members, stating that CNMs have to demonstrate their compliance status but contributions are not mandatory, so it should not be a formal requirement for granting or denying status. 2.3.2 Granting of CNM status for 2015 Ecuador"
WCPFC11,33,WCPFC11 agreed to approve the application for renewal of CNM status in 2015 for Ecuador.  El Salvador
WCPFC11,34,WCPFC11 agreed to approve the application for renewal of CNM status in 2015 for El Salvador.  Liberia
WCPFC11,35,WCPFC11 agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2015 for Liberia.  9
WCPFC11,36,"FFA members requested a clarification on the process, noting that it had raised the issue of non-payment of contributions, and that those who have not paid their contributions should not become CNMs. They also restated concerns about bringing excess capacity into the region."
WCPFC11,37,"The Chair suggested that for this to take effect, FFA members would need to vote ‘no’ for that particular CCM, unless it is agreed to grant conditional approval as FFA members had suggested. The Chair proposed that this and other issues be resolved in a small working group. The Chair noted that WCPFC11 had agreed to grant CNM status to the first three applicants considered and had not closed the discussion on Mexico’s application. If the group wanted to discuss the possibility of status provisional to certain conditions, the group could see how that works. In response to a clarification sought by a CCM about CNM status being met without the contribution being made, the Chair reminded participants that the decision to grant or not grant is the Commission’s and, although WCPFC has a procedure, this issue has come up two years in a row. Adopting a formal procedure may be necessary."
WCPFC11,38,"The EU made the point that the contributions are voluntary, not a formal obligation."
WCPFC11,39,"One CCM noted that the CMM reads: “shall include with its request an explicit commitment to make financial contribution… in accordance with section 18(2) of the Convention,” which has subsequently been qualified to a 50% contribution. This CCM stated that it wasn’t unreasonable to have such a condition in place."
WCPFC11,40,"The Chair requested that a small group form to look at these issues, and reminded WCPFC11 that if there were issues with the three CNMs which had been approved, the group would need to formally undo those statuses."
WCPFC11,41,The TCC Chair offered further information on the CNM applicant countries:  Ecuador: has paid 2013 and 2014  El Salvador: has paid for 2014  Liberia: made a commitment to provide a contribution  Mexico: did not include an explicit commitment; did not pay in 2013  Panama: has paid 2013 and 2014  Senegal: did not include an explicit contribution; did not pay 2013 or 2014  Thailand: paid for 2014; partial payment in 2013  Vietnam: has paid for 2014  DPRK: included explicit commitment to make a contribution but has not paid for 2014
WCPFC11,42,"In response to a question from one CCM about whether Senegal was a CNM this year, the TCC Chair confirmed that Senegal was not a CNM this year; its application is for 2015. Senegal was a CNM for 2013 (and its contribution was then not paid)."
WCPFC11,43,One CCM queried whether an applicant could be accepted as a CNM but the second step in the two-step process could be to effectively not grant any participatory rights.
WCPFC11,44,The TCC Chair noted that the process is to accept CNM status then determine participatory rights and confirmed that the financial contribution had not been discussed before to this extent in relation to the acceptance of their status. 10  Mexico
WCPFC11,45,"Since Ecuador and El Salvador made contributions for 2014, the Chair advised WCPFC11 that it may not need to revisit either of those cases. The Chair suspended discussion on Mexico’s application and continued to work through the list of CNM applicant countries. Panama"
WCPFC11,46,"In response to a question about the process being undertaken, the Chair noted that the group was suspending decisions on applicants which have not made a voluntary contribution and the small working group will advise WCPFC11 how best to deal with their applications. He reminded delegations that the procedure is not explicit, but that Panama has paid."
WCPFC11,47,WCPFC11 agreed to approve the application for renewal of CNM status in 2015 for Panama. Thailand
WCPFC11,48,"The Chair noted that Thailand has paid for 2014, but not in full for 2013."
WCPFC11,49,WCPFC11 agreed to approve the application for renewal of CNM status in 2015 for Thailand. Vietnam
WCPFC11,50,"Japan reiterated its request that the Commission be updated by Vietnam on its shipbuilding, explaining that it wished for this update before granting Vietnam CNM status."
WCPFC11,51,Vietnam confirmed that it could provide information by the end of this week.
WCPFC11,52,The Chair suspended discussion on Vietnam’s CNM status.
WCPFC11,53,"The Chair noted that several countries had raised concerns and a small working group would discuss and recommend to the Commission the nature of the participatory rights of the several countries that had been granted CNM status. The issues with the other countries do not fall neatly within the Commission’s procedures, including the notion of conditional acceptance. The small working group could discuss how to treat the CNM status for those countries with contributions outstanding and report back with a general recommendation on whether or not to grant CNM status. If affirmative, the small working group would then discuss participatory rights and also perhaps improvements to the process."
WCPFC11,54,"One CCM noted there was a clear need to consider these issues as a whole, further noting there was some confusion about how to proceed."
WCPFC11,55,New Zealand accepted the role of Chair of the small working group looking at CNM participatory rights and related matters.
WCPFC11,56,"The Chair recalled that one CCM had raised the issue of Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico and whether the Commission should issue invitations to these countries to become members.  11"
WCPFC11,57,"The EU noted that it is better in general when CNMs become full members. This CCM views CNM status as a ‘transition’ status of sorts, on the way to having full rights, commitments and obligations. This CCM stressed that each application should be examined on its own merit."
WCPFC11,58,"Some CCMs noted that these countries are also members of IATTC and since that organisation shares fish stocks and an overlap area with WCPFC, it would be a positive development if they became members."
WCPFC11,59,"Several CCMs noted the problem of overcapacity, which WCPFC should consider when thinking about new members, and WCPFC may not be in a position to accept new members."
WCPFC11,60,The Chair noted the lack of consensus on the issue and sought agreement that the Secretariat should develop a procedure for the next meeting around accepting new members. One CCM supported the suggestion.
WCPFC11,61,"One CCM requested clarification about this tasking of the Secretariat, noting that the Convention is clear: once there is consensus, non-members can be invited to become members. This CCM stated that this process worked quite well."
WCPFC11,62,"One CCM noted that while it too was concerned about capacity, it was an assumption that these countries would bring purse seiners into the region, or even capacity, and the group should not pass up an opportunity to engage these countries on management and improving sustainability. Having them within the Commission brings more engagement and there should be a dialogue about why they want to be members of the Commission."
WCPFC11,63,One CCM suggested that establishing pre-conditions could be a solution; committing to a capacity reduction to become a full member.
WCPFC11,64,The EU stated that these countries’ motivations must be examined on their merit and they should be invited to explain what they see as their contribution to WCPFC.
WCPFC11,65,One CCM noted that the issue was one of RFMOs harmonizing management in the region.
WCPFC11,66,The Chair suspended discussion on this issue to accommodate discussions in the margins through the small working group established to prepare draft decisions points for consideration by WCPFC11 relevant to any reviews of Cooperating Non-Member participatory limits.
WCPFC11,67,"After consultations, on 5 December Mr Shannon Tau (New Zealand) presented the CNM SWG report (WCPFC11-2014-28).  Cooperating Non-Members - Report by Small Working Group"
WCPFC11,68,"At the Chair’s direction a small working group was established to consider the applications of CNMs and, where a decision to renew status was proposed, to assess associated participatory rights. Further, the group was directed to consider the concept of conditional acceptance raised in plenary and the process of progression of CNM applications generally. 12"
WCPFC11,69,Framework documents for the working group were CMM 2009-11 and Secretariat paper WCPFC11-2014-08. The group also referred to TCC10’s recommendations in the CNM section of the TCC10 Summary Report and the further recommendations highlighted by the TCC Chair during plenary session. These recommendations are set out below for reference.
WCPFC11,70,"A decision on CNM status had already been made with regard to several of the applicants before the SWG commenced. Those applicants were Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Panama, and Thailand. It was decided that where a decision to grant CNM status had already been made this would not be readdressed. TCC’s recommendations would still be considered though where, for example, information gaps had been identified and this was considered relevant for the subsequent granting of participatory rights."
WCPFC11,71,"This left the DPRK, Mexico, Senegal, and Vietnam for the group to consider in relation to granting CNM status as issues were raised regarding these applications during plenary session."
WCPFC11,72,"The small working group reviewed:  TCC10’s recommendations and requests regarding individual CNM applications;  Where necessary, information provided by applicants subsequent to TCC10;  Information provided during the course of the working group meeting."
WCPFC11,73,"The group noted with appreciation the attendance and participation of Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama and Vietnam in the SWG’s discussions and encouraged other CNM applicants to attend in the future."
WCPFC11,74,The group did not consider the issue of some CNM applicants indicating they would like to become full Members of the Commission. Relevant TCC Recommendations
WCPFC11,75,"TCC10 provided the following decisions and recommendations to WCPFC11: i. TCC10 has reviewed the following CNM applications and is forwarding them to WCPFC11 for consideration: Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Senegal, Thailand and Vietnam. ii. TCC10 thanked the Secretariat for the development of the CNM application template which assisted the process greatly. iii. TCC10 notes with appreciation the attendance and participation of Ecuador, El Salvador, Thailand and Vietnam at this year’s meeting and encourages other CNM applicants to attend TCC meetings in the future. iv. TCC10 recommends that WCPFC11 take into consideration the Compliance Status of all CNM applicants in making its decision on the CNM applications and participatory rights. Furthermore, TCC10 recommends that CNM applicants provide any information requested during the CMS process 30 days in advance of WCPFC11. v. Some CCMs noted their strong reservations in forwarding the applications of Panama, Mexico and Senegal to WCPFC11 for consideration due to the failure to submit a complete and timely Annual Report or failure to make a commitment to make a financial contribution. vi. Some CCMs recommended that WCPFC11 agree that, in addition to this year’s financial contribution, CNMs should be required to make any past financial contributions that remain outstanding. 13  vii. TCC10 recommends to WCPFC11 that if conditional grants of cooperating non-member status are given, that there be a clear process for how the final determination will be made. viii. TCC10 notes that three CNM applicants (Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico) have expressed an interest in becoming full members and recommends that WCPFC11 consider whether to invite them to become members. ix. TCC10 notes the following gaps in the applications for individual applicants and encourages applicants to rectify them if possible by WCPFC11: a. Mexico – TCC10 notes that Mexico has not provided a commitment to make a financial contribution. TCC10 further notes that Mexico has not agreed to accept High Seas Boardings and Inspections, however, Mexico currently has no vessels operating in the Convention Area. In addition, SPC noted that there may be some remaining data gaps in Mexico’s historical data. b. Panama – TCC10 noted that Panama submitted its Annual Report Part I and II during TCC and consequently it was not able to be assessed, and strongly encourages it to submit its Annual Reports on time in future years. SPC notes that it is receiving some transshipment data from Panama, but believes there remain some gaps in these data. c. Senegal – TCC10 notes that Senegal has not provided a commitment to make a financial contribution. d. Thailand - SPC notes that it is receiving some transshipment data from Thailand, but believes there remain some gaps in these data. e. Vietnam – SPC notes with appreciation the continuing improvement in data submission by Vietnam, but notes there remain some gaps in logbook data."
WCPFC11,76,Further recommendations identified by the TCC Chair are referred to below. According Cooperating Non-Member Status
WCPFC11,77,"As above, status for Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Panama, and Thailand was decided in plenary."
WCPFC11,78,"Discussion was held around the nature of the payment commitment set out in para 2(g) of CNM 2009-11. The group did not form a view on whether the requirement was mandatory and it was observed that while the Commission has to have regard to the requirements set out in the measure, non-compliance with these requirements by a CNM was not necessarily conclusive for the Commission determination which retained a discretion in this regard."
WCPFC11,79,Members of the group held different views on whether the requirement was to simply provide a commitment or to actually pay pursuant to this commitment.
WCPFC11,80,"In relation to process generally, there was discussion that an incomplete application did not necessarily lead to a recommendation of the SWG that a CNM application not be accepted and also required an assessment as to whether the reason for, or nature of, incompleteness warranted such a recommendation."
WCPFC11,81,"The group discussed paragraph 8 of CMM 2009-11 which states that, “The Commission shall accord CNM status on an annual basis. It may renew the CNM status subject to a review of the CNM’s compliance with the Convention’s objectives and requirements.”"
WCPFC11,82,The concept of conditional acceptance was also discussed by the group. 14
WCPFC11,83,"The group noted TCC’s recommendation to WCPFC11 that if conditional grants of cooperating non-member status are given, that there be a clear process for how the final determination will be made (this report para 75(vii))."
WCPFC11,84,The concept as relayed in plenary was presented to the group and is summarised below.
WCPFC11,85,"Members of the group were open to the concept of ‘conditional acceptance’ provided that the process for allowing CNM status intersessionally is clear, such as: (i) clearly identifying the information/requirement gap;  (ii) that information or requirement is to be met or provided to the ED by a certain date; (iii) the ED advises all CCMs, and forwards the advice/information as appropriate; (iv) unless an objection is received within a certain date of receipt of the ED’s letter, conditional acceptance is lifted and CNM status is allowed; and (v) the ED confirms this to all CCMs."
WCPFC11,86,This approach was endorsed by the group noting that the clarity of obligation was important for this process to work effectively and that conditional acceptance should be avoided where possible through the applicant fulfilling all relevant obligations in advance of the Commission. DPRK
WCPFC11,87,The small working group noted that DPRK’s application was received after TCC and therefore was not able to be assessed by TCC. The application was also not in the template form provided by the Secretariat and no representative from DPRK was in attendance at the SWG. The group recommended that the Commission not accept the DPRK application in light of these factors.
WCPFC11,88,WCPFC11 did not accept the application for renewal of CNM status in 2015 from Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Mexico
WCPFC11,89,The group considered Mexico’s application incomplete in that it didn’t provide an explicit commitment to make a financial contribution or to accept high seas boarding and inspection but noted this was not necessarily conclusive.
WCPFC11,90,Mexico was a participant in the small working group. Mexico advised that they continue to have national legislation which does not allow high seas boarding and inspection or the attribution of budget for financial contribution where Mexico is not a full member of the Commission.
WCPFC11,91,The issue of whether commitment or actual payment was necessary was discussed in relation to Mexico’s application. An aspect of discussion was whether imposing a condition of payment in Mexico’s national law circumstance was appropriate. An indication was provided by Mexico that payment of any kind was unlikely but that it would investigate the possibility of a voluntary payment.
WCPFC11,92,"Mexico noted that it did not allow high seas boarding and inspection for any of its vessels worldwide but stated that were it to have a vessel presence in the WCPFC it would need to 15  address this issue. On this basis Mexico stated that until this issue was resolved it would not seek to have a vessel presence in the Convention area. The SWG recommended that the Commission ask Mexico to investigate the possibility of a voluntary payment. Noting Mexico’s national laws position and its lack of vessel presence for 2015, this would not be a condition on Mexico’s CNM status but a request to be met if at all possible."
WCPFC11,93,"Taking the above into account, the group provided a recommendation for granting of CNM status to Mexico which was accepted by the Commission."
WCPFC11,94,Japan reminded the Commission that at TCC10 some CCMs made the point that CNMs must pay a contribution to the Commission commensurate with the benefits they receive from the fishery and should share the costs of managing and conserving it (para 23 of the TCC10 report).
WCPFC11,95,"WCPFC11 agreed to approve the application for renewal of CNM status in 2015 from Mexico, on the understanding that the Secretariat will write a letter to Mexico advising that Mexico’s non-payment of any financial contribution generated extensive discussion at WCPFC11. Some CCMs noted their strong concern at the unfairness for SIDS CCMs and other CNMs due to this non-payment and those CCMs did not consider the lack of presence of any Mexico vessels to justify non-payment. Those CCMs also noted that if this concern is not addressed before Mexico’s next application for CNM status any such application would not be supported by those CCMs."
WCPFC11,96,New Zealand offered to draft this letter for the Secretariat. Senegal
WCPFC11,97,The group considered Senegal’s application incomplete in that it didn’t provide an explicit commitment to make a financial contribution but noted this was not necessarily conclusive.
WCPFC11,98,The group recommended that the Commission grant Senegal CNM status conditional upon payment of financial contribution of its 2015 assessed amount by 90 days after 15 January 2015. It was noted that Senegal are requesting a small longline fishing presence as per previous years.
WCPFC11,99,"The EU made a point of clarification, noting that CCMs had not come to agreement whether a financial contribution was a condition. The EU recalled that some CCMs did not take that view, while the report wording implies there was a conclusion. For Mexico, it was one of the elements taken into consideration, and for Senegal it is mentioned."
WCPFC11,100,"The CNM SWG Chair confirmed the group did not form a final view, and clarified that the CNM status was not premised on whether or not a financial contribution was mandatory. Delegates were referred to para 8 of the CMM, which provides for the Commission to accord CNM status on an annual basis and may renew the CNM status subject to a review of the CNM’s compliance with the Convention’s objectives and requirements. This gave the Commission a broad mandate in this regard. The CNM SWG Chair noted that Senegal is seeking a fishing presence and to receive a benefit from the fishery. In response to a query from the EU as to the decision-making process, the CNM SWG Chair noted that the contribution wasn’t the only basis for the decision. 16"
WCPFC11,101,"One CCM asked about the contribution amount assigned to Senegal, and noted that it shared the EU’s concern about disparate treatment. This CCM urged the SWG to ensure a fair, consistent approach when looking at this issue in the future."
WCPFC11,102,"The CNM SWG Chair advised that the contribution amount for Senegal would be assessed by the Secretariat for 2015 and would presumably be similar to the amounts assessed in 2013 of USD13,537, in 2012 of USD11,568 and 2011 of USD13,686."
WCPFC11,103,"Canada acknowledged the difficulty for some CNM applicants to provide a financial contribution, though noting that Senegal will receive financial benefits from the fishery. This CCM observed that the measure is clear on providing a commitment to make a financial contribution, as opposed to making that financial contribution and cautioned that making approval conditional appears to make the financial contribution mandatory. This view was supported by some other CCMs."
WCPFC11,104,"The Chair suggested the Commission consider modifying the measure next year or the year after, to have greater clarity around whether the contribution was ‘voluntary’ or ‘required’."
WCPFC11,105,"Tuvalu stated that it, like most other FFA countries, manages to make a contribution even though many FFA members don’t have any flagged vessels. This CCM stated that until the contributions are paid, the applicants should not be granted CNM status."
WCPFC11,106,"The EU expressed the view that if contributions are mandatory, that condition should be clarified somewhere, in the CMM or by adopting an interpretive rule, otherwise it could be arbitrary. The EU suggested this could be done next year."
WCPFC11,107,The Chair suggested including the issue on the agenda for WCPFC12.
WCPFC11,108,"The CNM SWG Chair noted that Senegal’s participation in the fishery was not the only factor the group considered, and advised that the initial position from some members was to not support the CNM status. However, as a compromise, they could support it this year."
WCPFC11,109,One CCM took the view that CNMs should pay a contribution to the Commission compensatory with the benefit received from the fishery.
WCPFC11,110,"RMI stated for the record that if the issue is to be reviewed, it would like it reviewed in the light of implications on SIDS relating to both financial and fishing opportunities."
WCPFC11,111,"WCPFC11 agreed to approve the application for renewal of CNM status in 2015 for Senegal, on the condition that it pays its assessed contribution for 2015 by 90 days after 15 January 2015. Vietnam"
WCPFC11,112,The issue around capacity was resolved with Japan and the small working group recommended Vietnam be granted CNM status. Vietnam will present to the Commission the result of the investigation on the capacity issue raised by Japan.
WCPFC11,113,"Vietnam informed the Commission that six vessels were completed between 2010 and 2013 and a further one vessel last month. All vessels are currently operating in the Indian Ocean. One further vessel is being constructed, scheduled for 2015 delivery. It is not clear 17  yet where the vessel will be operating. There are no other contracts for the construction of further large-scale tuna fishing vessels in Vietnam. Vietnam noted that a report had been requested at future Commission meetings on the construction of large-scale tuna fishing vessels in Vietnam, and Vietnam will be happy to do this. Vietnam took the view that this should not be part of the procedure for the granting CNM status."
WCPFC11,114,"Japan acknowledged Vietnam’s report, and expressed appreciation for Vietnam’s commitment to reporting to WCPFC on further constructions in the future. Noting that the new vessel was ordered by a French company, Japan asked EU to take action to guide the company that its new vessel shall operate in the Convention Area without increasing total capacity of purse seine in the area.  2.3.3 Participatory rights"
WCPFC11,115,"The group noted TCC’s recommendation that that WCPFC11 take into consideration the Compliance Status of all CNM applicants in making its decision on the CNM applications and participatory rights (TCC10 summary report para 26(iv)) and the point that was made that participatory rights of CNMs need to be considered against the recognition of wider participation rights of SIDS members in the Commission. It was observed that capacity management of purse seiners needs to be considered, recalling the Commission’s concerns on capacity."
WCPFC11,116,"In accordance with the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following limits apply to the participatory rights of Cooperating Non-Members (CNMs) for fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area. In addition, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under their national jurisdiction or other CCMs national jurisdiction, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements. Such CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPF Convention and the WCPFC conservation and management measures. In addition, CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV). CCMs shall ensure that CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention. Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will be conditional on full compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, and all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention. CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the TCC."
WCPFC11,117,The CNMs identified below provide assurances that they will comply with all requests from Commission Members for information and documentation to investigate cases of possible illegal fishing.
WCPFC11,118,The Commission advised CNMs to ensure that they meet the deadline for submission of applications for CNM status and meet all the obligations contained in CMM 2009-11. The Commission noted that failure to meet the above requirements could prejudice the future granting or renewal of CNM status.
WCPFC11,119,The Commission noted TCC’s recommendation that WCPFC11 take into consideration the Compliance Status of all CNM applicants in making its decision on the CNM applications and participatory rights (TCC10 summary report para 26(iv)) and the point made at the 18  SWG that participatory rights of CNMs need to be considered against the wider participation rights of SIDS members. WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area
WCPFC11,120,"In accordance with the decision of WCPFC9 regarding the management of the overlap area south of 4˚S and between 130˚W and 150˚W, vessels flagged to Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico will be governed by the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area. Accordingly, the participatory rights for, Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico below apply to the WCPFC Convention Area excluding the overlap area."
WCPFC11,121,"In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area."
WCPFC11,122,"For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with international and domestic laws, vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area. Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)"
WCPFC11,123,"As the group did not consider DPRK’s application should be accepted by the Commission, participatory rights were not considered or recommended. Ecuador"
WCPFC11,124,The SWG noted Ecuador’s non-compliant status from TCC10 and encouraged Ecuador to aim for full compliance in 2015.
WCPFC11,125,The group noted WCPFC11’s approval of the application for renewal of CNM status by Ecuador and provided a recommendation for participatory rights which was accepted by the Commission.
WCPFC11,126,"WCPFC11 agreed that Ecuador’s participatory rights for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2013-01 or its replacement measure.  El Salvador"
WCPFC11,127,The SWG noted El Salvador’s non-compliant status from TCC10 and encouraged El Salvador to aim for full compliance in 2015.
WCPFC11,128,The group noted WCPFC11’s approval of the application for renewal of CNM status by El Salvador and provided a recommendation for participatory rights which was accepted by the Commission. 19
WCPFC11,129,Japan stated its view that Ecuador and El Salvador shall not increase the number of purse seine vessels with its flag operating in the Convention Area above the level of 31 December 2012.
WCPFC11,130,WCPFC11 agreed that the participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. The total level of effort by purse seine vessels of El Salvador on the high seas shall not exceed 29 days in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2013-01 or its replacement measure.  Liberia
WCPFC11,131,The group noted WCPFC11’s approval of the application for CNM status by Liberia and provided a recommendation for participatory rights which was accepted by the Commission.
WCPFC11,132,"WCPFC11 agreed that the participatory rights of Liberia are limited to reefer vessels to engage in transshipment activities, and bunker and supply vessels to support fishing vessels in the Convention area. Mexico"
WCPFC11,133,The SWG noted Mexico’s compliant status from TCC10.
WCPFC11,134,"The SWG recommended that the Commission ask SPC to further identify the remaining gaps in historical data identified at TCC10 and request that Mexico provide this to the Secretariat, if possible."
WCPFC11,135,The group recommended that WCPFC11 approve the application for renewal of CNM status by Mexico and provided a recommendation for participatory rights which was accepted by the Commission.
WCPFC11,136,"WCPFC11 noted that Mexico has participated in the work of the Northern Committee (NC) at NC 8, 9 and 10 and, noting the need for cooperation with the work of the NC particularly in regard to Pacific bluefin tuna, encouraged Mexico to continue to participate in the NC. Mexico does not intend to have a vessel presence in 2015. Any future introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2013-01 or its replacement measure. Panama"
WCPFC11,137,The SWG noted Panama’s non-compliant status from TCC10 and encouraged Panama to aim for full compliance in 2015.
WCPFC11,138,"The group noted that Panama submitted its Annual Report Part 1 and 2 during TCC and consequently it was not able to be assessed, and that TCC10 strongly encouraged it to submit its Annual Reports on time in future years. SPC notes that it is receiving some transshipment data from Panama, but believes there remain some gaps in these data."
WCPFC11,139,"The group asked the Commission to strongly encourage Panama to provide its reports as above and recommended that the Commission request that SPC/Secretariat further identify 20  the transhipment data gap and request that this information be provided by Panama to the Secretariat, if possible."
WCPFC11,140,The group noted WCPFC11’s approval of the application for renewal of CNM status by Panama and provided a recommendation for participatory rights which was accepted by the Commission.
WCPFC11,141,WCPFC11 agreed that the participatory rights of Panama in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels. Senegal
WCPFC11,142,The SWG noted Senegal’s non-compliant status from TCC9 and encouraged Senegal to aim for full compliance in 2015.
WCPFC11,143,The group noted WCPFC11’s conditional approval for renewal of CNM status by Senegal and provided a recommendation for participatory rights which was accepted by the Commission.
WCPFC11,144,WCPFC11 agreed that the participatory rights of Senegal be limited to one Senegalese longline vessel to be authorised to fish in the Convention area. Any introduction of fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2013-01 or its replacement measure.  Thailand
WCPFC11,145,The SWG noted Thailand’s non-compliant status from TCC10 and encouraged Thailand to aim for full compliance in 2015.
WCPFC11,146,"The SWG recommended that the Commission ask SPC to further identify the missing transhipment data identified at TCC10 and request that these data are provided by Thailand to the Secretariat, if possible."
WCPFC11,147,The group noted WCPFC11’s approval of the application for renewal of CNM status by Thailand and provided a recommendation for participatory rights which was accepted by the Commission.
WCPFC11,148,WCPFC11 noted the need for cooperation between Thailand and the Commission and the commitment from Thailand to provide data from canneries located in Thailand to assist in the work of the Commission. WCPFC11 agreed to grant CNM status to Thailand for 2015 on the understanding that Thailand will cooperate fully with the Commission in the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data. The Commission notes the provision of data from Thai canneries and encourages Thailand to continue to cooperate with the Commission to improve the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data. The participatory rights of Thailand in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only. Vietnam
WCPFC11,149,The SWG noted Vietnam’s non-compliant status from TCC10 and encouraged Vietnam to aim for full compliance in 2015.  21
WCPFC11,150,"The SWG recommended that the Commission ask SPC to further identify the missing logbook data identified at TCC10 and request that these data are provided by Vietnam to the Secretariat, if possible. Vietnam noted that its fishing activities only occurred in its own waters outside the Convention area but that it was prepared in the interests of the Commission to make the data available, if possible."
WCPFC11,151,The group recommended that WCPFC11 approve the application for renewal of CNM status by Vietnam and provided a recommendation for participatory rights which was accepted by the Commission.
WCPFC11,152,"WCPFC11 noted the need for continued cooperation between Vietnam and the Commission to achieve compatibility of fisheries management and conservation, as well as on the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data, for which Vietnam would require assistance. WCPFC11 agreed to approve the application for renewal of CNM status in 2015 from Vietnam. The Commission notes the significant improvements in the collection and provision of data from Vietnam fisheries through the GEF WPEA project, administered by the WCPFC and encourages Vietnam to continue to cooperate with the Commission to improve the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data. The participatory rights of Vietnam in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only. General Process"
WCPFC11,153,"The group recommended that a more directive and particularised letter from the Secretariat be provided to a CNM applicant after TCC where an incomplete application had been identified. For example, that the nature of any data gap be set out more clearly. Also, there was a suggestion that TCC be more directive in relation to consequences of failure to provide such information. For example, that TCC would recommend an application be viewed less positively by the Commission if the required information were not to be provided."
WCPFC11,154,WCPFC11 accepted the recommendation from the CNM SWG that a more directive and particularised letter from the Secretariat be provided to a CNM applicant after TCC where an incomplete application had been identified.  AGENDA  ITEM  3  -  EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CCM REPORTS 3.1 Report of the Executive Director on the work on the Commission
WCPFC11,155,"Dr Lara Manarangi-Trott, Interim-Executive Director of the WCPFC Secretariat, presented a report on the work of the Commission for 2014 (WCPFC11-2014-09), offering apologies that the report wasn’t provided in the minimum required time under the rules of procedure. Several key outcomes for the Secretariat in 2014 were reported, including the financial accounts being responsibly managed, the Secretariat working actively in the local community to promote the Commission and its work, a number of community programs and initiatives, which were well received, and Secretariat staff volunteering their personal time to assist with preparation for the Micronesian Games. SPC conducted a number of new stock assessments, activities under the WPEA project have continued through 2014 with inception workshops for that project, the buildings and surrounds are in good 22  condition and well maintained, and on 25 October the Commission signed an execution agreement with the FAO for a package of work designed to mitigate adverse impacts of bycatch in global tuna fisheries, which will continue through to early 2019. Dr Shelley Clarke has been appointed the GEF ABNJ Tuna Project Coordinator – Sharks and Bycatch. The work will facilitate collaborative work between IATTC, WCPFC and FAO in the areas of sharks and bycatch. Compliance and information management activities by the Secretariat continued, with significant work building and supporting the Commission’s CMS, including a full online system this year, generating a draft compliance report and following the compliance process all the way through TCC and the annual meeting. Implementation of RFV SSPs and the creation and delivery of a publicly available and fully searchable RFV. The Commission has continued to have interactions with organizations in the region and beyond and, as in other years, prepared for and held SC, NC, TCC meetings and a number of workshops. The Interim-Executive Director drew attention to two staffing matters that the Secretariat is required in accordance with the staff regulations to inform the Commission:  the re-appointment of the WCPFC Science Manager, Dr Sung-Kwon Soh, who regained the position through an open recruitment process, and the Observer Programme Coordinator being advertised this year but the outgoing Executive Director pausing recruitment for that position until a new Executive Director was appointed. The Secretariat paper details various contracts and consultancies, as well as intersessional activities."
WCPFC11,156,"On behalf of the Commission Secretariat, the Interim-Executive Director acknowledged the excellent work outgoing Executive Director Professor Glenn Hurry did in support of the Commission. On behalf of the Secretariat she offered him the very best in his next ventures. The Chair observed that the Commission was lucky to have him."
WCPFC11,157,"FSM expressed sincere appreciation to the outgoing Executive Director for his excellent leadership and for working closely with the people and government of FSM to improve understanding of the work the Commission does for the region. FSM gave special mention to the Secretariat’s support for the Micronesian Games, and for the continued support and assistance provided to FSM with entry of their observer data at the Secretariat.  3.2 Statements of CCMs"
WCPFC11,158,The Chair invited WCPFC11 participants to make brief opening statements.
WCPFC11,159,"His Excellency Shane Jones, New Zealand Ambassador for Pacific Economic Development, conveyed three key messages to the Commission:  the significance of fisheries resources in the Pacific region, especially to SIDS;  the imperative of an effective and functioning Commission to achieve regional conservation outcomes and the need for the Commission to be a global leader in this regard; and  key priorities for this meeting were the need for high quality and regular data to ensure well informed stock assessments and the effective management of the fishery. New Zealand places a high priority on the management and development of fisheries resources and high quality and timely data. This CCM noted their industry’s presence in the fishery, which needs national stocks to remain viable. New Zealand recalled that delegations enjoyed discussions in Samoa on economic development of SIDS and the need for partnerships; fisheries are almost the sole resource of some Pacific Island nations. New Zealand reminded delegates that it is essential to confront harmful subsidies in other 23  international fora, noting that New Zealand has stripped subsidies from industry. This region has some of the ocean’s healthiest stocks, but the Commission needs to deliver benefits to resource owners and certainty to industry. New Zealand confirmed its key priorities for the Commission meeting included the operational data proposal, the harvest strategies proposal outlining the need for harvest control rules and target reference points, and the proposal for better management of South Pacific albacore. New Zealand noted that the Tokelau Arrangement is important initiative which can be built on year after year, and expressed the hope that all other CCMs will embrace the spirit of this agreement and commit to the South Pacific albacore measure proposed at this Commission meeting."
WCPFC11,160,"Hon Lenatai Victor Faafoi Tamapua, Associate Minister, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, noted that Samoa takes its obligations very seriously, as reflected in its CMR. Samoa is experiencing a decline, especially in South Pacific albacore, due to a ramp up in longline effort in the Convention area and a lack of robust controls. The fishery is in jeopardy and Samoa called for urgent help. Samoa updated the Commission that it had declared limits for purse seine fishing and sought the support of the Commission and members to fulfill this aspiration. This CCM expressed its commitment for South Pacific albacore limits and FFA members’ CMM for South Pacific albacore. This fishery needs a management and implementation framework. Samoa asked that CCMs not see this as a threat, and explained that the importance of the resource is not just about money, it is a lifeline."
WCPFC11,161,"Hon. Elisala Pita, Minister for Works and Natural Resources, Tuvalu drew the Commission’s attention to the critical importance of the decisions made at this meeting to small, fishery-dependent states. Tuvalu is small and extremely remote, with almost nothing but fishery resources, revenues from which finance schools, hospitals, and outer island communities. CMM 2013-01’s fourth month of FAD closure is implemented by Tuvalu but this closure has greatly reduced the profitability and attractiveness of fishing in the waters of Tuvalu, and has compromised Tuvalu’s revenues. At the same time, other coastal states did not impose the closure in their waters, distant water longliners did not deliver bigeye catch reductions, and bigeye high seas catches have increased. This CCM explained that it was hard for Tuvaluans to understand why they should subsidise other fishing fleets. The capacity provisions of CMM 2013-01 are also problematic as Tuvalu struggles to develop its own domestic purse seine fleet and utilise its fishery resources. Along with other members of FFA and PNA, Tuvalu will fulfil its fishery management responsibilities, but also intends to pursue its rights within the Commission."
WCPFC11,162,"As a WCPFC Participating Territory, American Samoa explained that it has a substantial interest in the conservation and management of the region’s highly migratory fish stocks. Pago Pago is the home port of a domestic albacore longline fishery that fishes primarily in the American Samoa EEZ, the home port for US purse seine vessels fishing in the region and the home of two of the largest canneries in the Pacific, employing nearly half of the territory’s workforce. Like many other Pacific Islands countries, American Samoa’s economy is dependent on tuna fishing and processing. This CCM noted that Pacific island nations have long enjoyed an intimate relationship with the sea. As modern technology brought advances in fishing and commercial exploitation, the ocean has suffered. Like other Pacific Island states, American Samoa has development aspirations and noted the importance of recognizing the special requirements of SIDS and Territories within Commission decisions. American Samoa stated that the most important issues for them at this meeting include:  24   continuation of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme;  adopting a comprehensive South Pacific albacore measure;   eliminating loopholes for the non-provision of operational data; and  establishing a fair and objective process to define and measure disproportionate conservation burden on SIDS and Participating Territories.  American Samoa looks forward to working with other CCMs on these issues during this meeting."
WCPFC11,163,"Indonesia noted its significant improvements in national policy for sustainable use of fisheries resources, including taking a number of regulatory actions in this regard such as a moratorium on the issuance of fishing permits for all vessels greater than 100 GT. At the Bali Tuna Conference, Indonesia made a commitment to permanently close for four months each year a suspected tuna spawning ground within its archipelagic waters to purse seine and gillnet fishing. The closure of the Banda Sea area will begin in mid-December 2014. Indonesia believes that protecting this area from fishing activities will contribute to the health of tuna resources in the WCPO. Indonesia will seek clarification at this meeting on how it can materialize Article 30 of the Convention and para 49 of CMM 2013-01. Indonesia stated that, as a developing country, it seeks to develop its purse-seine fisheries in the high seas of the WCPO, and construct new purse seine vessels without a prior written recommendation from this Commission."
WCPFC11,164,"Hon. Luwalhati Antonino, Chair of Mindanao Development Authority, Philippines gave a statement of support for the Commission."
WCPFC11,165,"Hon. Billy Talagi, Minister of Natural Resources, Niue noted that his country’s interests in the Commission remain: stocks being managed sustainably, managing impacts of commercial fishing to avoid adversely affecting food security, realizing the economic development opportunities from highly migratory stocks and not diminishing or losing them, and the Southern Albacore longline fishery. This CCM stated that the wellbeing and interests of SIDS can’t be excluded or ignored in an effort to maintain or enhance commercial interests in the fishery, or considered collateral damage. Niue’s interests in the tuna fisheries, relative to most Commission members, are almost insignificant but they are significant to Niue’s economy and people and could be catered for quite easily in the Commission, and without delay. Niue thanked Professor Glenn Hurry for his contribution to the running of the Commission, and wished him well in his endeavours."
WCPFC11,166,"Papua New Guinea would like to see effective and appropriate mechanisms developed to encourage members to comply with their obligations under the Commission. This CCM took the view that the Commission should focus on the effective management of the high seas, while recognising the sovereignty and sovereign rights of coastal states to develop their fisheries. SIDS should be given every opportunity to develop their fisheries through strategic investments in value addition by downstream processing their catch as it creates jobs and generates much needed revenue for their people. PNG is committed to the transformation of benefits derived from the harvest of tuna fisheries resources to coastal, inshore and inland fisheries developments to address food security and poverty alleviation in SIDS with limited capacity."
WCPFC11,167,"Tokelau highlighted the critical part fisheries play in SIDS’ social and economic wellbeing. Fisheries are a main source of economic security and a vital part of Tokelau’s culture and heritage and the region’s health and food security. Tokelau valued its membership in the 25  Commission and other organizations and is prepared to do its fair share to conserve and manage the marine environment and looked forward to the Commission addressing its obligations to ensure conservation and management measures do not place a disproportionate burden on SIDS and Territories. Tokelau expressed concerns about the conservation of sharks, reminding the Commission that it declared its EEZ a shark sanctuary five years ago, and the southern albacore fishery. Tokelau highlighted the Tokelau Arrangement to improve the management of the albacore fishery and looked forward to a successful conclusion on this matter at this meeting. This CCM is also focused on a proposal with PNA to strengthen the tropical tuna measure and ensuring any new measure is fair and does not place a disproportionate burden on Tokelauans."
WCPFC11,168,"Australia noted the overriding purpose of the Commission is ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable management of the highly migratory fish stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean and members share an interest in meeting this objective, now and into the future. For the Pacific Island members, within whose waters a significant proportion of the fisheries lie, the offshore fisheries sector delivers up to 70% of national income and represents one of a limited number of development opportunities. In Australia’s view the disproportionate burden on SIDS will only increase if fish stocks continue to be overfished. The evidence before the Commission increasingly suggests the need to take more purposeful and effective action. Australia’s priority is the adoption of a new CMM that provides a framework for the development of harvest strategies for key fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, a mechanism that will bring together existing work, set the direction for the Commission’s next endeavours, and provide the path to fair, effective harvest strategies for the region’s fisheries."
WCPFC11,169,"Japan observed that it has two faces in the region as a distant water fishing nation whose fleet mainly operates in the tropical zone, and as a coastal state with artisanal fishing around its coastal area. As a distant water fishing nation, Japan has fully cooperated in introduction of meaningful and effective tropical tuna measures. On the other hand, as a coastal state Japan is suffering from disagreement between scientific advice and the reality in its coastal areas. For example, the science advice shows stock status of skipjack tuna in the Convention Area is healthy with a biomass twice as high as one that will support MSY, but Japan is suffering from poor skipjack migration to its coastal areas. Japan stated that its difficulty is the same as for many island members. Japan would like to cooperate to reach a compromise in the discussion of both the CMM on tropical tunas and TRP of skipjack. Finally Japan stressed its tremendous commitment to Pacific bluefin tuna resource management."
WCPFC11,170,"The Cook Islands highlighted the great importance it places on its marine heritage and ocean treasures, and also recognises the sovereign burden that comes with stewardship over its large EEZ area. At this session, the Cook Islands will be paying special attention to the conservation and management of the southern albacore longline fishery and, noting its recent signing of the Tokelau Arrangement, intends to seek a proportionate response from the distant water nations which fish in the waters of the Cook Islands. This CCM highlighted the importance of stronger management measures of the adjoining Eastern High Seas Pocket.   26  AGENDA  ITEM  4  -  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES 4.1 CCM reports on the implementation of Article 30"
WCPFC11,171,The Chair noted that this was a standing agenda item and that a paper summarizing CCM Annual Report Part 2 reporting under CMM 2013-07 paragraph 19 is accessible to CCMs on the secure side of the website (WCPFC11-2014-10).
WCPFC11,172,"Chinese Taipei reported on its implementation of Article 30 and CMM 2013-07, to provide assistance to SIDS including for MCS, technology transfer, observer training, and support for the fisheries sector. This CCM has assigned scholarships, conducted technical training and provided technology and technical staff for many years and encourages investment in SIDS’ fisheries sectors. A total of USD2 million in a special fund over 5 years for fisheries-dependent SIDS now exists – the Chinese Taipei Trust Fund. This fund has been set up to finance SIDS’ implementation of conservation and management. Chinese Taipei is assisting SIDS with technological capability to advance their participation in MCS activities. Chinese Taipei and island CCMs have developed close relations over the years and is confident the Trust Fund will make a meaningful contribution to SIDS."
WCPFC11,173,"The EU referred delegates to WCPFC11-2014-DP19, which summarizes its support to the region on fisheries-related issues. The main source of support is €18 million provided under the European Development Fund, with work delivered under two main projects, DEVFISH2 and SCICOFISH. DEVFISH2 funding of €8.2 million has been extended to March 2016, with an increase of over €500,000. It has supported several activities including addressing, among others, capacity building for competent authorities, for establishing the legal and organizational frameworks, sanitary/food safety issues related to certification of seafood for export, support to industry, E-Monitoring observer trials in longline fisheries, IUU catch certificate training, and support for combating IUU, including National Plans of Action in a number of Pacific Island nations. Scientific support is provided under SCICOFISH, which in 2014 provided €8.6 million and has been extended to September 2015 with a budget increase of €9.2 million. SCICOFISH has provided support for capacity building activities, including observer training courses in Pacific islands countries, Marine Stewardship Council certifications, trainers and debriefers, development of fisheries databases in a number of countries and web-based logsheet systems, and support to regional stock assessments including for silky sharks."
WCPFC11,174,"Nauru acknowledged and welcomed the initiative by Chinese Taipei in introducing the Trust Fund, and looked forward to its full implementation and Pacific Island nations’ full utilization."
WCPFC11,175,"Japan noted that since 2008 it has supported SIDS’ capacity building for fisheries statistics, stock assessments and monitoring through the Japan Trust Fund. This amounted to USD400,000 in 2014. Japan also supported SIDS through an FFA Promotion Fund, dispatching fisheries experts from Overseas Fisheries Cooperative Foundation and JICA and receiving trainees from developing states. Japan conducted a joint enforcement operation in one SIDS members’ EEZ in October and plans to expand such operations. Project activities, including construction of infrastructures, have been funded totaling approximately 450 million Yen over the last 5 years. Japan plans to continue cooperating with SIDS members into the future.  27"
WCPFC11,176,"FFA members noted that the outcome document of the SIDS conference, the Samoa Pathway 2014, underlined that SIDS remain a special case for sustainable development, with their unique characteristics and vulnerabilities, and highlighted the need for genuine partnerships with developed nations to achieve development. The WCPF Convention recognises the Commission’s duty to give full recognition to the special requirements of SIDS in relation to conservation and management of fish stocks and the development of fisheries for such stocks, and recognises that they are the members most seriously affected by Commission decisions. FFA members noted that this is the backdrop for two significant CMMs adopted by the Commission last year, CMM 2013-06 on the criteria for consideration of conservation and management proposals and CMM 2013-07 on the special requirements of SIDS. Both seek to operationalise Article 30 of the Convention. Specific to CMM 2013-06, FFA members noted that consideration has been given to questions which seek to assess the impacts on SIDS and ensures SIDS’ needs are mainstreamed into the WCPFC’s decision-making process. CMM 2013-07 lays down a framework for transferring the provisions in Article 30 and Resolution 2008-01 into legally binding obligations and compels members of the Commission to take action. FFA members were keen to find a way the assistance can be targeted to specific SIDS' needs. These CCMs suggested a way forward: (i) SIDS continue to articulate their special requirements in a delegation paper (based on the approach used in WCPFC11-2014-DP20); (ii) such delegation papers can be put before the SC and TCC meetings and any updates included before it is then put before the Commission meeting;  (iii) such delegation papers could be used as a checklist at each meeting to assess what specific needs have been met; and (iv) the list could be updated by FFA Members, as required, when such needs have been met or as more specific needs are set out arising from new Commission obligations."
WCPFC11,177,"The delegation paper would be treated as a living document. FFA members welcomed input from non-FFA participating territories in the further development of this paper, and referred the Commission to WCPFC11-2014-DP20."
WCPFC11,178,"FFA members thanked CCMs who reported on their assistance to SIDS. Under para 19 of CMM 2013-07, CCMs are required to provide information in their Annual Report Part 2 on implementation of this measure. Referring to WCPFC-TCC10-2014-10, FFA members noted that out of the 11 received from developed CCMs, only 5 (which included two FFA members) provided detailed responses. This reporting is required of all developed CCMs to enable an assessment of whether assistance is being provided as required by the measure and Article 30. FFA members suggested the Secretariat be tasked to put together a reporting template for CMM 2013-07 para 19 in the Annual Report Part 2 which is based on the categories in CMM 2013-07, to facilitate analysis of the types of assistance provided and highlight gaps. FFA members also drew participants’ attention to WCPFC11-2014-DP23, which proposes a new approach to how SIDS will be assessed in the CMS."
WCPFC11,179,"Korea noted that it will continue to cooperate with SIDS to develop capacity building to support fisheries conservation and management. This CCM hoped to finance the WCPFC’s tag and release program by providing 100 million Korean Won, equivalent to around USD100,000, every year over the next 5 years. It would be delivered in December 2014. The Korean government will make efforts to provide more financial assistance to the WCPFC. 28"
WCPFC11,180,"Australia advised that in 2013-14, it contributed approximately AUD12 million in development assistance to help Pacific Island countries manage their fisheries, and reported that Australia had provided an update on its implementation of CMM 2013-07 in its Annual Report Part 2. The Australian aid program is expanding its assistance to the Pacific fisheries sector, in recognition of the development aspirations of Pacific Island countries and the importance of fisheries to economic growth and food security in the region. In 2013-14, Australian aid included capacity development of SIDS nationals, enhancing the participation of SIDS in monitoring, control and surveillance activities and providing support for the domestic fisheries sector of certain SIDS. This funding and aid is largely delivered through regional organizations which provide services to members based on member-identified priorities: SPC Aquaculture and Marine Ecosystems Division – approximately AUD4 million per annum, and FFA – AUD5.1 million per annum. In addition, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority provided capacity and technical assistance for port State measures and legal and administrative arrangements to PNG and Kiribati, and Australian Fisheries Management Authority officers regularly take part in regional operations, providing assistance to SIDS’ patrol boat boarding parties and joint operation coordination centres."
WCPFC11,181,"New Zealand noted that Article 30 is a critical feature of the Convention text, facilitating active participation by developing states to meet fisheries management objectives. This CCM stated that any measures agreed should not cause disproportionate burden. New Zealand has committed to provide NZD82 million to support Pacific island fisheries management development and compliance during 2012 to 2017/18. This includes support to specific countries for in-country institutional strengthening, regional and national information services, vocational training, regional observer program, SPC data management and stock assessments for Pacific island countries, FFA fisheries management development and compliance advice and services."
WCPFC11,182,The Chair asked for views on adopting the recommended process that FFA outlined in WCPFC11-2014-DP20_rev1.
WCPFC11,183,"The Cook Islands urged members to consider the FFA paper, and noted its checklist is an example of a living document."
WCPFC11,184,Several CCMs commented that more time was needed. One CCM noted that it was not clear if an obligation is placed on a CCM by the checklist.
WCPFC11,185,"The EU asked for clarification about the legal status of the paper, querying whether it was something like an aide memoire or more like a performance review. This CCM queried whether there were legal consequences as it was not a CMM."
WCPFC11,186,Japan reminded the Commission that Asian nations need more time to digest the paper because of its language problem.
WCPFC11,187,"FFA members thanked all who spoke, and explained that the paper was premised on the question which is put to SIDS: “what do you require assistance on?” The table in the paper addresses this. FFA members asked that time that is given in this meeting to progress an outcome on this, noting that it was an FFA proposal which supported CMM 2013-07 and did not pre-empt the CMR process.  29"
WCPFC11,188,Canada queried how it related to the CMR process and what linkages there were with another proposal which would be discussed later in the meeting.
WCPFC11,189,The Chair suspended the discussion on this issue to give delegations time to digest the information in hardcopy.
WCPFC11,190,"After some consultations during the meeting, FFA members tabled a revised working paper (WCPFC11-2014-DP20_rev2)."
WCPFC11,191,"The EU asked for clarification on the paper’s status, as it was not a CMM but a supporting paper, and commented that the paper would be more useful if it was country-specific, identifying specific needs, as not all SIDS need the same kind of assistance. The EU noted that it has specific internal procedures and rules for regional development aid  and suggested language such as ‘tool to better target assistance’ or ‘guide’ were preferable. While the checklist can be transmitted to counterparts in other services of the European Commission, they would use it as a guide, and not as a compulsory document. The EU explained that development aid is organised regionally, and is discussed extensively with interested countries and with regional bodies."
WCPFC11,192,Japan supported the EU and remarked that it was not comfortable with the name of “check list”. Japan commented that the paper should be a list developed by SIDS. Japan also commented that the paper should be used as something for reference in the internal procedures for regional assistance.
WCPFC11,193,"FFA members explained that even though it is not in the form of a CMM, the paper is meant to implement a Commission obligation. These CCMs appreciated the assistance rendered to SIDS but noted the paper intends to provide targeted assistance, specifically for the obligations to SIDS under the Convention."
WCPFC11,194,"The Vice Chair noted para 2(iv) of WCPFC11-2014-DP20_rev2 provides that it be treated as a living document. The Vice Chair noted that there was general agreement for the checklist existing, but that CCMs had expressed a preference not to be limited to the checklist; this would respect their own internal processes for using other things in addition to the checklist. The Vice Chair suggested that when CCMs go through their internal processes, this can be at the forefront of their considerations."
WCPFC11,195,"One CCM noted that this could be a useful tool, and did not see it as intended to limit assistance or raise an expectation from any one developing CCM that all these types of assistance will be required. The checklist helps identify needs so developed CCMs can target assistance toward that list."
WCPFC11,196,"FFA members stated their great appreciation for the reports of assistance provided by some developed CCMs. In addition, FFA members proposed an approach that would allow such reports to be more targeted to specific SIDS needs in tuna fisheries, through the following: a. SIDS continue to articulate their special requirements and set this out in a Delegation Paper (similar to WCPFC11-2014-DP20_rev2); b. such DP/checklist can be placed before the SC and TCC meetings and any updates included before it is placed before the Commission meeting; 30  c. the FFA-SIDS DP could be used as a checklist at each meeting to assess what specific needs have been met;  d. the list could be updated by FFA Members, as required, where such needs are met or as more specific needs are set out arising from the annual ever-increasing Commission obligations. Hence, the DP is to be treated as a living document."
WCPFC11,197,"WCPFC11 noted the checklist in WCPFC11-2014-DP20_rev2 provided by FFA members, setting out an evaluation of SIDS special requirements and the respective status of assistance, and agreed to take into consideration the checklist as a guide to assist developed CCMs to assess the status of assistance to SIDS. (Attachment D)"
WCPFC11,198,"WCPFC11 tasked the WCPFC Secretariat to put together a reporting template for paragraph 19 of CMM 2013-07, which incorporates the various categories in that measure. It was noted that this will facilitate the analysis of the types of assistance provided by developed CCMs to implement CMM 2013-07 as a whole, and highlight any gaps in such assistance."
WCPFC11,199,"On the latter decision, the Interim-Executive Director remarked that the Secretariat was happy to have this tasking and would gladly receive input before the Annual Report Part 2 online system needs to be finalised for 2014 reporting. 4.2 Review of Implementation of CMM 2013-07"
WCPFC11,200,There was no further discussion on CMM 2013-07. 4.3 Report from the Chair on Implementation of CMM 2013-06 and Disproportionate Burden Workshop
WCPFC11,201,"The Chair reported on discussions during the 27 November 2014 Disproportionate Burden Workshop held just prior to WCPFC11, and advised that a final summary report from the workshop would subsequently be posted once comments were received (WCPFC11-2014-11). That report highlights a series of items that the workshop agreed, explaining that it took some time to agree those points and they would not be reopened. The group indicated that proponents should give the issue serious consideration, consulting with SIDS prior to full development of proposals so they will understand from the SIDS’ point of view what burdens are likely to be placed on them. The workshop came to the view that the ultimate decision on whether a disproportionate burden stems from a decision taken by the Commission is on the Commission, not on an individual CCM, and the Commission should maintain some flexibility in how it deals with or mitigates an identified disproportionate burden. It was strongly encouraged that the proposals are provided at least one month ahead of the Commission meeting or earlier. It was agreed that for the immediate future the primary way the Commission would be deal with disproportionate burden in CMMs would be through CMM 2013-06."
WCPFC11,202,"PNA and Tokelau made a statement about the special requirements of developing states, especially SIDS. Most of the catch is taken in and around the waters of SIDS and many SIDS are dependent on these resources for their sustainable development. These special requirements include the obligation on the Commission to avoid transferring a disproportionate burden from its measures. PNA and Tokelau stated that they supported the workshop as an opportunity to make progress and to improve the Commission’s 31  effectiveness in conserving and managing stocks, especially tropical tuna, where these factors are centrally important. These CCMs were encouraged by the paper presented by FFA on the concept of disproportionate burden and appreciated some of the analysis and ideas from the Honolulu workshop. However the Disproportionate Burden Workshop was an opportunity lost and did not address what these CCMs consider has been a systematic effort to sideline disproportionate burden and say it should not be taken into account until it is identified and measured through a complex bureaucratic process. Similarly, the importance of CMM 2013-06 as an instrument for addressing the impacts on SIDS and avoiding or removing disproportionate burden was undermined. As a result, the Commission now heads into an important discussion on arrangements to remove the disproportionate burden of conservation action transferred onto SIDS by CMM 2013-01 without any apparent progress on the form or content of those arrangements. The eight points in the report provide the basis for going forward. CCMs need to keep talking to each other on the basis of those points, especially through the application of CMMs 2013-06 and 2013-07, so it forms part of the mainstream of discussions on measures rather than a subject dealt with separately through workshops or working group processes."
WCPFC11,203,"Palau noted that it could not participate in the Disproportionate Burden Workshop but on reading the draft report it appears that disproportionate burden does not exist until it is proven that it exists. Palau reported it is already feeling the impacts of climate change, and the rhetoric on that very important issue sounds very similar. Palau does not want to see a situation where fish stocks are running out and small countries have to retreat from the central Pacific."
WCPFC11,204,"One CCM was pleased that the workshop report recognised those CCMs which used the checklist for their proposed measures, and commented that if a proponent wishes for a measure to be passed, SIDS should be consulted so mechanisms can be discussed."
WCPFC11,205,WCPFC11 accepted the report of the Implementation of CMM 2013-06 and Disproportionate Burden Workshop. (WCPFC11-2014-11_rev1)  AGENDA  ITEM  5  -  REPORT OF THE MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES WORKSHOP  5.1 Report on Progress from MOW3
WCPFC11,206,"Ian Cartwright briefly presented WCPFC11-2014-12_Rev1, the summary report of the Third Management Objectives Workshop (MOW3), which was held on 28 November 2014, in Apia, Samoa prior to WCPFC11. The first MOW, in Manila in 2012, considered management objectives, indicators and reference points, and was primarily a capacity building exercise. The expert panel drafted for the second MOW (MOW2) a ‘strawman’ document which included a candidate list of management objectives, performance indicators, and target reference points for each major fishery. WCPFC10 had agreed to hold an additional workshop (MOW3) in 2014 with further input from the expert panel and supporting analyses by the Scientific Services Provider and tasked the Executive Director with exploring external sources of funding for another workshop in 2015."
WCPFC11,207,"Mr Cartwright made some observations on the MOW process:  32   it is a useful opportunity to discuss technical issues in an informal setting, allowing for an open exchange on key matters of interest;  work is directed by the Commission, though most of the work is done by FFA and SPC, on which MOW can piggyback;  it is relatively cost-effective as it operates alongside Commission meetings but is still expensive;  it is an informal process which has grown from its original purpose and should perhaps be renamed a “Management Strategies Workshop’;  it is now too large for detailed technical discussions on important fisheries management issues, and there may be a need for small intersessional group work; and  there is no clear place in Commission structure in which to feed through advice/recommendations of this nature."
WCPFC11,208,"The objective for MOW3 was to discuss and report to WCPFC11 on management issues including: the establishment and development of a management framework based on a harvest strategy approach, determining risk levels, a TRP for skipjack and associated multispecies impacts and a process for developing a TRP for South Pacific albacore."
WCPFC11,209,"If the harvest strategy CMM is adopted, a one or two day workshop before a meeting is probably insufficient to progress some of the issues involved, with some delegations considering that a small technical advisory group might be a good approach. It would need to be funded at an appropriate level."
WCPFC11,210,Mr Cartwright suggested three areas of future work:   Technical scientific support through the Scientific Services Provider   External experts to support the scientific process  WCPFC level stakeholder meetings to consider and direct the work.
WCPFC11,211,"One CCM commented that it had wanted SPC to undertake the work on reference points and harvest control rules, and remarked on the conclusion on page 8 of the report supporting the establishment of a technical working group. This CCM did not agree with it being recorded as an agreed outcome and PNA members did not support the proliferation of such bodies, believing the work should be integrated into the work of SC and TCC."
WCPFC11,212,Several CCMs supported the ongoing work of the MOW.
WCPFC11,213,"FFA members noted that although it has taken almost a decade for the Commission to get to the point of discussing management principles, general agreement is emerging on establishing a structured process to achieve shared management objectives for key stocks. Although the workshop was created to exchange views not make recommendations on particular proposals, FFA members were encouraged to hear the views expressed about the basic concept of the FFA Harvest Strategy CMM proposal. Comparing the current state of stocks to when the Commission was first established, developing measures to try and fix problems after they emerge is a system which is not working well. FFA members supported establishing a basic framework to help the Commission develop management rules in a structured, forward-thinking way, while allowing for existing reference point decisions and agreed objectives to be carried forward."
WCPFC11,214,"Japan was generally supportive of the idea of the precautionary approach, noting that Article 6.1 (a) of the Convention tasked the Commission to determine stock-specific 33  reference points and Article 6.3 to develop harvest control rules. Japan expressed its view that WCPFC should concentrate efforts to develop  harvest strategies that are stock-specific in order to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of stocks in the Convention Area, pointing that development of a harvest strategy approach for fisheries in short period is practically impossible due to mixture of many fisheries in the area. It is with this understanding that Japan and Indonesia had jointly submitted comments on the FFA harvest strategy CMM. Regarding a TRP for skipjack, although the majority of CCMs think 50% of the estimated recent average spawning biomass in the absence of fishing would be appropriate, for Japan and some island members,it is not enough for recovery of this stock to the level before local depletion was observed. Japan also stated that the MSY approach is not perfect for the stocks like skipjack which are caught mostly in the tropical area but which exist almost across the entire WCPO. Finally, Japan supported 60% of the estimated recent average spawning biomass in the absence of fishing as a TRP for skipjack."
WCPFC11,215,"The Chair reminded delegates that the current discussion was focused on the MOW process and its utility to the Commission, rather than a specific reference point."
WCPFC11,216,The EU supported the MOW process and expressed the view that the Commission was at the start of a much longer process which would guide the work of the Commission in years to come. The MOW provides a stable and objective framework by which the Commission can adopt CMMs. The EU could provide funding for this essential work.
WCPFC11,217,"Canada noted that this third session was much more focused on proposals, which moves the Commission in the right direction to a clearer focus on management objectives around tropical tuna stocks as well as South Pacific albacore. This CCM noted that within the NC there has been some tangible progress for some northern stocks, which should be continued, and suggested there be some congruity between the two processes. This CCM had been uncertain about the progress being made through the MOW process but was now more supportive given the more concrete results coming out of it. A lot will hinge on budgetary implications. It was noted that there could be contributions from the NGO community and others."
WCPFC11,218,"One CCM took the view that it should be a bit more formal, and remarked favourably on the suggestion of a management strategy approach. This CCM saw the MOW process as an investment and it was timely to be looking at a fisheries management role."
WCPFC11,219,"Referencing one CCM’s comment on the meeting’s record, Mr Cartwright noted that the record was still draft and nothing was locked in. The Report of MOW3 was finalised, and the latest draft was WCPFC11-2014-12 Rev2 (dated 3 December 2014)."
WCPFC11,220,WCPFC11 accepted the Report of MOW3 (WCPFC11-2014-12 Rev2). 5.2 Future work plan and funding
WCPFC11,221,"The Chair noted that a number of comments around the table supported the MOW process as a concept, and there was also a view that the kinds of activities happening in the MOW could be integrated into the SC and TCC."
WCPFC11,222,"In response to a query, the Interim-Executive Director advised that a MOW Workplan and budget was in preparation. It would take into account the comments which had been expressed and would be circulated and discussed at the FAC. The Interim-Executive 34  Director commented that it was always a pleasure having Mr Cartwright facilitate the MOW and his expertise was greatly appreciated by the Commission."
WCPFC11,223,"The Chair commented that with an increased focus on compliance issues in TCC, issues were coming to the Commission un-vetted. The Chair suggested that many of the proposals were considered by the Commission to be very complicated and technical, and it might serve WCPFC well if there were a body that could review those issues and report to the Commission."
WCPFC11,224,"One CCM agreed that there was a need to vet proposals, or conduct technical work, so by the time an issue is brought to the Commission, key technical discussions are able to have taken place. This CCM was loathe to create additional bodies as the Commission has limited resources, but agreed that it was a discussion the Commission must have."
WCPFC11,225,One CCM commented that some or all of these issues can be put through SC or TCC.
WCPFC11,226,The Chair confirmed that the FAC would review a draft work plan to progress WCPFC’s consideration of a management framework as proposed by MOW3 (WCPFC11-2014-12b).
WCPFC11,227,"WCPFC11, taking into account offers of supplementary funding through CCM voluntary contributions and those from external sources, was able to allocate sufficient funding in the approved 2015 budget, which should together allow for the proposed 2015 activities in the MOW3 workplan to progress the consideration of a management framework in 2015 (see WCPFC11-2014-12b) to be fully funded during 2015.    AGENDA  ITEM  6  -  CMM 2013-01 TROPICAL TUNA MEASURE 6.1 Chair’s presentation on Tropical Tuna Measure CMM 2013-01"
WCPFC11,228,"Referring the Commission to WCPFC11-2014-13, the Chair noted a number of issues in CMM 2013-01 that required the Commission’s attention at this meeting, including an issue in the measure relating to the duration of FAD closures, and capacity management. Recalling the proposal from PNA members + Tokelau to amend certain provisions of CMM 2013-01, and Japan’s comments on that proposal, the Chair advised that discussions at Heads of Delegation suggested that considering the issues together and working them through in a small working group would be appropriate. The Chair advised that the group would need a Chair. The Chair sought views on how to progress the work on CMM 2013-01 during WCPFC11."
WCPFC11,229,"Referring to their paper, WCPFC11-2014-DP08, FFA members shared the view of others that CMM 2013-01 needs to be strengthened at WCPFC11 and reminded delegates that bigeye status has declined to a point where it is both overfished and subject to overfishing, and that the science shows that the CMM has the potential to come close to recovering the stock if fully implemented. FFA members’ priorities for WCPFC11’s deliberations on the tropical tuna CMM are as follows:  Improvements to purse seine measures, including the FAD closure, effort limits, particularly in the high seas, management to reduce effort creep and address disproportionate burden. 35   A greater contribution to bigeye conservation and management by the longline sector, including compliance improvements, stronger effort management and an explicit limit for longline yellowfin catches.  Provision of operational data."
WCPFC11,230,"FFA members stated that the Commission has to find ways of improving the effectiveness of the primary management tools in CMM 2013-01, but not in ways that perpetuate the disproportionate burden on SIDS for conservation and management of tropical tunas. FFA estimates that the FAD closures have cost the purse seine fishery up to $390 million since 2009, significantly eroding the profitability of this fishery from which many SIDS secure critical revenue. These CCMs strongly expressed the view that the Commission must not allow amendments to the tropical tuna CMM that further increase the cost borne by SIDS, and the draft PNA members + Tokelau CMM provides a comprehensive starting point."
WCPFC11,231,Several CCMs supported the establishment of a small working group to work on these issues in detail.
WCPFC11,232,"Japan expressed strong concern about the decreasing trend of bigeye and skipjack stocks explained in the SC10 report. Japan reminded WCPFC11 that the number of FAD sets in 2013 still exceeded the level of 2010, although SC10 reaffirmed SC8 recommendation to reduce the number of FAD sets to below 2010 levels. Japan stated that the measure for tropical tunas is less effective than anticipated and the Commission needs to establish additional measures that consider the recommendation by SC10 seriously. Regarding the provision of operational data, Japan stated that it will provide the data under the cooperative analysis for Pacific-wide bigeye stock assessment although it has domestic legal constraints. Japan further noted the concerns of Japanese fishermen about the reduced migration of skipjack to its coastal area."
WCPFC11,233,Some CCMs expressed the view that the tropical tuna measure is too young to properly assess its impact.
WCPFC11,234,"The USA expressed the view that the Commission should focus on addressing the outstanding elements of CMM 2013-01, not reopen or revise the measure more generally, and noted the sorts of projections that the Commission must rely on to design its conservation and management measures: a.   The Scientific Services Provider’s evaluation of the expected effectiveness of the measure tells us that CMM 2013-01 has promise to get close to the Commission’s objectives, if not meet them.  b.   The evaluation of CMM 2013-01 that was conducted by the Scientific Services Provider (WCPFC11-2014-15) concludes that if future recruitment remains on average consistent with recent (2002-2011) levels, the CMM will reduce the risk of the spawning biomass falling below the limit reference point (LRP) to 4% relative to the status quo (2012) risk of 32%, and will reduce the median level of fishing mortality to approximately the MSY level. This CCM noted that as the fisheries are monitored in the coming years, these projections will change, and the Commission can respond accordingly.  There is a measure in place, and there has not been enough time to see its impact, and while references have been made to failures to comply with CMM 2013-01, the lack of compliance doesn’t seem to have been raised in the CMR process. The best course is to allow the existing measure to continue on, and focus on three issues that require resolution 36  this year: whether or not there is a disproportionate burden on SIDS created by this measure, b) the issue of capacity provided in para 54(c) and c) limits on yellowfin tuna catch."
WCPFC11,235,"The EU noted that there was no indication in the science that the measure is not achieving the desired results, as it is too early to assess results due to the lack of recent data. The EU expressed the view that rather than reopening the measure the Commission should focus on compliance and monitoring, removing existing loopholes in the measure, eliminate exceptions and look at any possible disproportionate burden, but the latter should be seen within a wider framework."
WCPFC11,236,"One CCM noted that the small working group should not be convened simultaneously with plenary. On the issue of operational data, this CCM noted that some members, including this one, have domestic constraints which limit its provision. But under a cooperative arrangement with SPC, which was agreed 2 months ago, some data can be provided. This CCM sought clarification about the additional month FAD closure and questioned whether additional longline closure was needed."
WCPFC11,237,"One CCM recalled that it took years of negotiations to adopt CMM 2013-01 and noted that the current approach to reduce fishing mortality in the existing measure is practical, hence it preferred to limit any significant change to the measure. This CCM noted that it currently cannot supply operational data due to domestic legal constraints, but it had sent its scientists carrying all the operational data to the office of SPC in February this year, these efforts have been acknowledged by SPC in many documents. Besides, an agreement to make available all the operational data for the pan-Pacific bigeye tuna stock assessment of 2015 has been reached between some CCMs and SPC, this CCM will continue to make operational level data available to SPC in accordance with the agreement for stock assessment. This CCM also stressed the issue of provision of operational level data shall be separated from discussion of this measure."
WCPFC11,238,"Referring to their proposal, WCPFC11-2014-DP11, three priority starting points for PNA members in reviewing CMM 2013-01 are: a) para 15, which commits the Commission to ensuring the CMM does not result in transferring a disproportionate burden of conservation action onto SIDS. These CCMs expressed the view that the existing CMM transfers a substantial disproportionate burden onto SIDS and arrangements were required to remove this burden, as agreed last year; b) para 56, in which it was agreed that the tropical tuna CMM would be reviewed this year. From information provided to SC and the TCC, key elements of the CMM are not having the intended effect of reducing fishing mortality on bigeye; previous longline bigeye catch limits have failed to reduce catches; purse seine bigeye catches are rising while the number of FAD sets is falling; and c) operational data – tropical tuna fisheries cannot be effectively managed while the major longline fleets conceal the high seas operations of their vessels, refuse to carry independent observers or enter ports where offloads can be monitored. PNA and Tokelau noted they have submitted proposed revisions to the CMM addressing these factors, to improve the prospects for the CMM."
WCPFC11,239,The Chair noted the differing views. 37  6.1.1 Updated scientific advice (SPC-OFP)
WCPFC11,240,"Dr John Hampton (SPC-OFP) presented an update of key fishery data relevant to CMM 2013-01 as well as WCPFC11-2014-15, a quantitative evaluation of the potential impact of the CMM on the stock status of bigeye tuna. Regarding recent fishery trends:  Purse seine effort has increased steadily and the level estimated for 2013 was a record high. 2014 effort, as indicated by VMS to 31 October, is tracking at the 2013 level.  The number of purse seine associated sets in recent years has remained at a high level near to the 2004 level. Catches of bigeye tuna have increased substantially, in part because of higher effort in the eastern part of the western and central Pacific where bigeye catch per unit effort (CPUE) is higher. Effort in the eastern area is higher in 2014 compared to recent years, and therefore high bigeye catches should be expected for 2014.  Purse seine FAD closures since 2009 have decreased the number of associated sets during the closure months to low levels, although not to zero because of legitimate sets on FADs in archipelagic waters and in the WCPFC/IATTC overlap area. As a result, the principal effect has been to dramatically reduce purse seine catches of bigeye tuna during the closure months. Some decreases in skipjack and yellowfin catches have also been observed during the FAD closures. By contrast, very high catches of all species are often observed in the months immediately following the FAD closures.  Longline catches of bigeye tuna peaked in 2004 and dropped in 2005. Since that time longline catches have remained at roughly the same level (noting that the preliminary estimate for 2013 is likely to be an under-estimate at this stage). In the core area of the tropical longline fishery, bigeye CPUE has declined since 2014 and fishing effort has increased."
WCPFC11,241,"CMM 2013-01 was evaluated using a suite of models chosen by SC10 running in projection mode. Future recruitment was sampled either from the long-term time series or from the most recent 10 year period of the assessment. More emphasis was given to the latter recruitment scenario, as per the recommendation of SC6. The results of the evaluation can be summarised as follows, noting that the below comments refer to the recent recruitment scenario:  Both the purse seine and longline fisheries are subject to measures, but with various exemptions or exclusions. The general approach was to assume that all measures scheduled to be in place by 2017 would be continued into the future, and that those parts of the fisheries that are not subject to measures would continue to operate at 2012 levels. Under these assumptions, purse seine effort with associated sets is estimated to reduce to 78% of the 2012 level, with effort using unassociated sets increasing by the same amount. Longline catch is estimated to decrease to 87% of the 2012 level under the assumptions noted above. All other fisheries were assumed to continue at 2012 levels.  The multi-model projections indicated that continuation of the status quo (2012) would result in a 32% risk of the bigeye spawning biomass remaining below the limit reference point of 20% of the recent average unfished level. Also, fishing mortality is estimated to remain above the MSY level with high probability.  The application of the CMM, as assumed, is estimated to reduce the risk of the spawning biomass remaining below the limit reference point of 20% of the recent average unfished level to 4%, and increase the median value of spawning biomass depletion from 24% to 38  30% of the recent average unfished level. Also, the median fishing mortality is estimated to reduce to approximately the MSY level."
WCPFC11,242,Some CCMs noted exemptions and exceptions undermined the CMM’s effectiveness.
WCPFC11,243,"The EU noted that a lot of fishing is taking place during FAD closures, and archipelagic waters are excluded from the measure, and that it is possible for a CCM that has adopted a national FAD management plan not apply the tropical tuna measure. The EU stated that the measure is applied in a patchy way that is difficult to monitor."
WCPFC11,244,"PNA members noted WCPFC Yearbook data showing a 40% increase in the catch of bigeye by purse seine vessels fishing on the high seas in 2013 compared to 2012. Because high seas effort was allowed to increase from 2014 under CMM 2013-01, FAD closures in the high seas is an issue that needs to be taken up by the Commission."
WCPFC11,245,"Noting that FAD sets are increasing even though there is a FAD closure, Japan stated that FADs should be controlled to a set number. Japan requested SPC provide longline data broken-down into a country by country basis, recalling data showing a longline effort increase. Japan noted that a breakdown figure on a country by country basis, by effort, by year for 10 years would be beneficial for the Commission to understand which CCM increased its longline effort. SPC agreed that it can do that and further clarified that it could do that during the meeting."
WCPFC11,246,"One CCM sought clarification about the longline catch, observing that it has been stable since 2007 but still well below the 2001 baseline average. Dr Hampton confirmed that it had declined dramatically since about 2005."
WCPFC11,247,"PNA members noted that the presentation shows that the CMM can be effective at removing overfishing of bigeye, but depends on the effectiveness of the FAD closure and the longline catch limits. These CCMs expressed the view that implementation of core measures have been a failure. Catches are at the same level as before agreed cuts and were the same as in CMM 2008-01. There was no reason to believe CMM 2013-01 would be any more effective, especially in light of a lack of operational data. Additionally, this CCM noted problems with the effectiveness of the FAD closure, and referred delegates to WCPFC11-2014-DP12."
WCPFC11,248,"PNA members expressed surprise that the longline reduction appears to amount to 12% at best; these CCMs recalled that it was agreed to reduce by 30% by 2017. PNA members noted an assumption in the data relating to one longline fleet, and observed that this is not the only fleet that seems to put more effort into getting around the bigeye catch limits than applying them, but this fleet, unlike some others, provides reliable data on their catches."
WCPFC11,249,The Chair thanked Dr Hampton for the presentation and suspended discussion on CMM 2013-01. 6.3 Strategy for progress through WCPFC11
WCPFC11,250,"Upon resumption of the discussion, the Chair queried the best way forward given the time pressures on the Commission’s discussions on the tropical tuna measure."
WCPFC11,251,One CCM viewed CCMs talking and identifying common ground as useful. 39
WCPFC11,252,"Some CCMs noted that the SWG should not meet concurrently with the heads of delegation meeting which would select the new Executive Director, as they were small delegations."
WCPFC11,253,"The Chair proposed scheduling time to discuss the tropical tuna measure and reminded CCMs that if the Commission couldn’t achieve everything then it should try and achieve as much as it could, and look for commonalities. The Chair noted that the Commission was faced with several outstanding matters in CMM 2013-01, including the capacity issue and establishing catch levels for yellowfin tuna, and needed to attend to those things. He reminded delegates that catch limits on yellowfin were agreed last year so there was no reason that issue could not be progressed at WCPFC11. The Chair further noted that WCPFC had been deferring significant activity on capacity; capacity issues were not something either SIDS or distant water fishing nations could resolve by themselves and durable partnerships were needed to address the tropical tuna issue."
WCPFC11,254,"After a number of meetings of the tropical tuna SWG, on 4 December Japan sought the Chair’s guidance on how to approach the measure, noting its importance and the short time available to resolve outstanding issues. Japan expressed the view that it was the responsibility of the Chair to instruct the group."
WCPFC11,255,"The Chair confirmed that the Chair can guide the group but not instruct it, and noted that no delegates had indicated that common understanding had been reached. The Chair advised that the SWG was to look at the disproportionate burden, capacity and yellowfin aspects of CMM 2013-01 at a minimum. 6.1.2 Outstanding issues and requirements for 2014 Additional FAD Management Options"
WCPFC11,256,"The Interim-Executive Director noted that in response to the tasking in paragraph 38 of CMM 2013-01, the former Executive Director had sent out Circular 2014/60, which was also tabled at SC10 and TCC10. The Secretariat had developed draft terms of reference for a FAD Management Options Working Group (Attachment 1 of WCPFC11-2014-13) and directed delegates to WCPFC11-2014-13, which lists outstanding issues and requirements under CMM 2013-01. The Interim-Executive Director directed delegates to refer to page 3 of WCPFC11-2014-13, noting that both SC10 and TCC10 had supported the establishment of the working group, and both committees had discussed possible elements which would be included in the objectives of a working group. The SC and TCC recommendations were considered by the Secretariat in developing the draft terms of reference (provided in WCPFC11-2014-13 Attachment 1). There remains some discussion to be had at WCPFC11 about how such a working group would conduct its business, and also the need for a Chair."
WCPFC11,257,"The Chair suspended discussions and asked the Commission to consider the draft document, which he proposed returning to later in the week during discussions on CMM 2013-01."
WCPFC11,258,"In advance of the finalisation of the budget on 5 December, the EU expressed a preference to come to agreement for a working group on FAD Management Options and to adopt the terms of reference (WCPFC11-2014-13_Att 1). The EU recalled strong interest to advance this work and reminded delegates of SPC papers and discussion at SC10 on the issue which 40  highlighted the need for more info on FADs and their monitoring and tracking. The EU thought the working group’s work could be mostly conducted electronically."
WCPFC11,259,The Interim-Executive Director reminded the Commission that the Secretariat was asked to prepare a draft TOR in response to the interest by TCC and SC in having a working group established. The Secretariat had not received any formal comments on the TOR during WCPFC11.
WCPFC11,260,"PNA members informed the Commission they had been working with Pew, trialling electronic FAD tracking and monitoring. The initial trial showed it is feasible, and PNA members are working towards a trial period across all foreign fleets in 2016. These CCMs supported the proposed working group as a good forum for coordination and to continue to improve FAD management. They agreed with the scope of the TOR set out in the paper’s Attachment 1 but asked that “FAD pricing” be added to the list of options in para (d) of the TOR."
WCPFC11,261,"PNA members asked for clarification about whether the FAD Management Options working group will be subsidiary body of the Commission, meaning the group would be open to all CCMs, that all observers to the Commission would have observer status, and that the working group may consult with any other organisation, including industry organisations. Otherwise industry would participate as members of national delegations. These CCMs noted that if a meeting took place, funding would need to be budgeted for SIDS."
WCPFC11,262," The Commission discussed whether there was a difference between a subsidiary body and a working group, and examples of the CDS, E-reporting and observers working groups were mentioned. It was noted that “in principle” agreement to establish a working group as a priority would assist with FAC budget discussions."
WCPFC11,263,"The Interim-Executive Director commented that past practice indicates that for a meeting of a working group there has to be a certain amount of money allocated in the approved budget that provides for the travel, DSA and other costs for developing members and participating territories to attend. There were indications from SC or TCC of the types of material the group would consider but there has been no discussion or advice from these bodies about how the working group should work, and it would be important for the Commission to clarify this so that the FAC can consider an appropriate budgetary allocation. The Interim-Executive Director added that electronic working groups haven’t worked particularly well, based on past experience."
WCPFC11,264,"Tuvalu noted that FAD management is important to PNA members, and they want an opportunity to participate actively in the working group."
WCPFC11,265,"The EU suggested that the group could start work as a virtual group and meet back to back with the SC and TCC, or independently of those meetings. This CCM noted that for the CDS working group the Commission only allocated USD20,000 but the EmandEr working group, because it was a standalone group, was allocated USD100,000 or USD120,000. The EU commented that there was a lot of coordinating work to be done and suggested that the working group have either a Co-Chair or Vice-Chair."
WCPFC11,266,"PNG hoped to be able to provide a Chair or a lead person to get it started, noting that it is currently working closely with PNAO and NGOs on this work.  41"
WCPFC11,267,"Pew Charitable Trusts informed the Commission that Pew had been supporting FAD tracking trials and noted that it was pleased to see this working group potentially coming into being, and hoped to work constructively in the group and support its efforts."
WCPFC11,268,There was no discussion on the Consultancy proposed in Circular 2014/60.
WCPFC11,269,"WCPFC11 agreed to establish a WCPFC FAD Management Options Working Group, and that USD100,000 should be allocated in the budget for 2015. WCPFC11 agreed to the TOR, including amendments (Attachment E). WCPFC11 elected Brian Kumasi (PNG) as Chair and Ray Clarke (USA) as Vice-Chair of the FAD Management Options Working Group. 6.1.3 Reporting on CMM 2013-01 (Secretariat)"
WCPFC11,270,"The WCPFC Secretariat tabled WCPFC11-2014-14_rev1, summarizing CCM reporting under CMM 2013-01, for review by the Commission. 6.2 Consideration of CCM proposals related to CMM 2013-01 6.2.1 PNA + Tokelau proposal to refine CMM 2013-01 Tropical Tuna CMM"
WCPFC11,271,"PNA members + Tokelau introduced a proposal to refine CMM 2013-01 (WCPFC11-2014-DP11) which included four major elements:  para 44 – operational data, which needed to be provided in full and openly, for stock assessments, analysis of management options, and for monitoring compliance.  addressing the failure of tropical longline management – proposed provisions for a high seas closure period, a ban on transhipment of frozen bigeye at sea to address high seas IUU fishing by longliners, a limit on manual reporting in the event of a VMS breakdown, independent observers, and further reductions in bigeye catches.  purse seine measures – including banning pre-dawn sets in FAD closure periods, bans on FAD deployment by tender vessels, reduction of high seas purse seine effort, bringing forward the high seas FAD closure, and limiting the number of FADs deployed by a vessel. These additional purse seine measures in PNA EEZs is conditional upon operational level catch data being provided and appropriate measures being adopted for high seas longlining.   improving the effectiveness of the CMM in ways that also reduce the disproportionate burden on SIDS of the existing measures – this includes addressing capacity provisions to obstruct SIDS’ domestic development."
WCPFC11,272,"PNA members and Tokelau thanked the Chair for chairing the tropical tuna SWG. These CCMs noted that WCPFC11-2014-DP11 included proposals to address the failure of the longline bigeye catch limits and excessive levels of longline effort, address the disproportionate burden on SIDS from the tropical tuna measure, and provide for operational data provision. These CCMs were pleased with progress made on operational data but expressed disappointment that no progress was made on any other aspects of CMM 2013-01."
WCPFC11,273,"PNA members reminded participants that, last year, the Commission agreed to adopt arrangements at this session to remove the disproportionate burden on SIDS from the 42  tropical tuna measure. PNA members and Tokelau’s proposals on this were not adopted either, with no alternatives proposed. The result is that the Commission is non-compliant with one of the central elements of its Convention, and CMM 2013-01 will continue to transfer a disproportionate burden of conservation action onto SIDS."
WCPFC11,274,"PNA members stated their commitment to effective tropical tuna management. These CCMs will continue to improve the effectiveness of the vessel day scheme and increase the price of vessel days to strengthen capacity management, and develop FAD tracking, FAD registration and FAD charging. 6.2.2 Strengthening CMM 2013-01 for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack (FFA)"
WCPFC11,275,"Discussions of paper WCPFC11-2014-DP08 are covered under Agenda 6.1. 6.2.3 Japan’s comments on PNA members and Tokelau proposal for CMM for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna in the WCPO"
WCPFC11,276,Discussions of paper WCPFC11-2014-DP15 are covered under Agenda 6.1. 6.2.4 Proposal by Japan on the Joint Reduction Plan of Purse Seine Fishing Capacity in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) Convention Area
WCPFC11,277,"Japan introduced its proposal for a joint reduction plan for purse seine fishing capacity in the WCPO (WCPFC11-2014-DP16). As stipulated in para 54 of CMM 2013-01, WCPFC10 agreed that CCMs other than SIDS shall jointly develop a scheme to jointly reduce the capacity of purse seine vessels larger than 24m with freezing capacity operating between 20˚N and 20˚S (LSPSVs), to the level of 31 December 2012 and submit it to WCPFC11. The proposal was made as a basis for discussion among non-SIDS CCMs to establish the agreeable reduction scheme. The proposed scheme included two implementation steps: a) CCMs which increased the number of LSPSVs flying its own flag from that of 31 December 2012 shall reduce the equivalent number of LSPSVs flying its own flag; and b) further reductions necessary shall be shared on a pro-rata basis of the number of LSPSVs flagged to each concerned CCMs of 31 December 2012 in order to share burden among those CCMs equally. Japan expressed its hope that there would be constructive discussion and rational deliberations on this important issue. Finally, Japan stated that the decision had already been made at WCPFC10 and requested the Chair not to mix up discussion on implementation of decisions with discussion on revisions to CMM 2013-01."
WCPFC11,278,"Several CCMs commented that Japan’s proposal was a good start but, referencing paras 2 and 3 of Resolution 2008-01, in which developed CCMs are to make concerted efforts and consider innovative options to reduce and or restructure their fleet so as to accommodate aspirations of SIDS and Territories to develop their own fisheries, asked Japan for clarification about how the proposal assists SIDS to develop their fisheries."
WCPFC11,279,"Japan clarified its proposal focuses on para 54 of CMM 2013-01, implementation of agreement at WCPFC10 to develop a scheme of capacity reduction. Japan stressed that no other CCMs concerned proposed the capacity reduction scheme"
WCPFC11,280,"USA noted that there were two paragraphs in CMM 2013-01 that deal with capacity plans – para 54, which requires non-SIDS CCMs to develop a joint proposal on capacity with 43  reductions back to 2012 levels for LSPSVs, and para 53 which relates to a capacity plan for the Commission, and asked Japan to clarify if the proposal responds to both paras. Japan clarified that the proposal related to para 54."
WCPFC11,281,"In plenary on 5 December, Japan noted that its vessel reduction scheme proposal did not come to a conclusion at this meeting, and Japan is still concerned about the continued expansion of purse seiners and excessive FAD utilisation by them. Japan wished to continue discussing this issue. 6.2.5 Others papers and proposals relevant to CMM 2013-01 Philippines proposal to use refrigerated vessels"
WCPFC11,282,"The Philippines presented WCPFC11-2014-DP22, a report on Philippine-flagged vessels operating in High Seas Pocket 1, and informed the Commission of its intention to allow its vessels operating on the high seas to use refrigerated carrier vessels instead of traditional ice chilled vessels to transport their catch to port. This CCM assured the Commission that the level of effort will be the same, that this change will not result into addition of effort, nor will it be used for the purpose other than transporting the lawful catch of the 36 vessels."
WCPFC11,283,One CCM expressed some concerns about the proposal as presented and commented that the exemption the Philippines had been granted was related to traditional activities. This CCM was concerned there may be the potential for the practice to grow into other areas.
WCPFC11,284,The Chair asked the Philippines to consult with other CCMs.
WCPFC11,285,USA shared the concerns and asked to be engaged in the Philippines’ consultations.
WCPFC11,286,"Based on those consultations, the Philippines reported back to plenary later in WCPFC11. This CCM had consulted with FSM, Palau, USA and Chinese Taipei. It was able to provide more information and talk about their concerns. The Philippines explained that the proposal is linked to the effort to go from a volume-based production to a value-based production, to avoid waste of valuable resources. It is linked to the ongoing capacity management program of the Philippines, wherein it is now implementing a moratorium on the construction of new vessels; this will continue even if the fleet’s capacity reduces and the catch of the remaining vessels will be kept at the same level. The Philippines committed to submit to TCC similar analysis that was provided to WCPFC11, reflecting the difference in volume caught versus wasted. This CCM expressed the view that it has a duty to prevent waste, and noted that about 6000mt of tuna is currently being wasted by the use of ice chilled carrier vessels. While a change can be made to a regulation, in order to minimise the possibility of confusion later on, this CCM proposed an amendment to Annex C of CMM 2013-01, deleting the word “ice chilled” next to the Philippines’ fishing vessels."
WCPFC11,287,The Vice-Chair asked whether CCMs wanted to amend CMM 2013-01 to take into account this request. One CCM suggested the Commission hold off on a decision and pass it to TCC to assess the proposal against the measure and provide a recommendation for the Commission. The Vice-Chair noted there was no consensus.
WCPFC11,288,"The Philippines reiterated that there remained the problem of waste, possibly 6000mt, and stressed that there would be no extra effort, that it was just a matter of preserving the quality of the fish. This CCM commented that it might be worth risking a TCC non-44  compliance report if the Philippines fleet continues to lose 6000mt of tuna, and requested the proposal be kindly considered."
WCPFC11,289,The Vice-Chair commented that the meeting did not have a lot of time left and referred the issue to TCC11.
WCPFC11,290,The Philippines made a commitment to provide information to the Commission on the progress of this issue. This CCM noted that it was proposing to allow its vessels to change from ice chilled to refrigerated carriers this year and is weighing the options. The Philippines hoped CCMs would take account of the purpose for the change. Views from Indonesia
WCPFC11,291,"Indonesia expressed its concern regarding the implementation of Article 30 of the Convention in relation to interpreting the agreed text under paras 49, 51 and 52 of CMM 2013-01 and expressed the view that Indonesia should not require any prior recommendation from the Secretariat and/or WCPFC members for the construction or purchase of longline vessels and/or purse seine vessels. Addressing provision of operational level data"
WCPFC11,292,"On 5 December, Japan announced that Japan, Indonesia, Chinese Taipei, China, Philippines, Korea and FFA members had drafted an arrangement on data provision (WCPFC11-2014-DP25_rev1) that would alter para 44quinquies, regarding operational data provision, in the PNA + Tokelau proposal (WCPFC11-2014-DP11). It would also include two footnotes. Japan explained that if the changes were agreed by the Commission it could be incorporated into the existing tropical tuna measure (CMM 2013-01)."
WCPFC11,293,"One CCM thanked the proponents for working hard for an agreement on this thorny issue. This CCM needed to review the proposal and raised initial queries about: which countries it applied to; what the timeframe for data submission was; whether historical operational data would be provided for south of 20˚N, and this differs from data provision  in 1 degree square data for the area north of 20˚N; Indonesia’s timeframe and whether there was a sunset; whether the CPUE indices would be stratified by 1 degree square per month rather than annually; whether it applied to all species or just tropical tuna."
WCPFC11,294,"Japan responded that the provisions would relate to all fishing subject to CMM 2013-01; the current draft is for future provision of operational level data – historical data is another issue, for consultation with FFA members and the Commission and bearing in mind the US’s arrangements with SPC; and Indonesia’s domestic law prohibits providing operational data at this stage. Japan noted that this was the maximum concession possible from Indonesia."
WCPFC11,295,"In response to Japan’s query about the proposal’s adoption, the Chair noted that one CCM had requested more time to consider the proposed text and the tropical tuna SWG had met three times without significant progress, although the issue was still open. In response to a query from the Philippines about the operational data proposal, which was part and parcel of the tropical tuna amendments, the Chair noted that the proposal will be incorporated into a revised CMM 2013-01 if adopted, and noted that the proposal is proposed to replace a paragraph in the PNA+Tokelau CMM proposal (WCPFC11-2014-DP11). The Chair wonder whether, if the Commission does not make progress on the PNA proposal 45  (WCPFC11-2014-DP11) after more consultations, a place should be found to insert it into the existing measure, or a decision to hold it in abeyance until WCPFC12. The Chair asked if delegations were comfortable with finding a place in CMM 2013-01 where the proposal could be included."
WCPFC11,296,"Japan responded that it was comfortable either way, but noted that it was necessary to adopt it this year. Japan suggested separating it from the PNA proposal and focusing on the data provision issue. Japan noted it was waiting for comments from USA, which was ready to address in the margins of the meeting."
WCPFC11,297,"After more discussions at WCPFC11, Japan advised that it could provide a revised version of the agreement, after consultations with the USA (WCPFC11-2014-DP25_rev2)."
WCPFC11,298,The Chair reiterated his question to CCMs as to whether the Commission agreed to put the paragraphs WCPFC11-2014-DP26_rev2 into the existing CMM.
WCPFC11,299,"Japan responded to an earlier question about a) the proposal’s application – it was limited to the 6 Asian CCMs, noting that other members already provide operational data; and b) the exemption of Indonesia – Indonesia has agreed to a 10 year time frame; the agreement shall not apply until Indonesia changes its national laws and in any event until no later than 2025."
WCPFC11,300,"The EU sought to understand the added value of the new proposal and the relationship between it and the current scientific data provisions, which already refer to the provision of operational level catch and effort data. This CCM cautioned that there may need to be amendments to ensure consistency between the two measures. The EU observed that there was a 3 year grace period, but noted that the tropical tuna measure is only in place until 2017 so these CCMs appear to have no obligation to provide data for the whole period of duration for the measure. So its added value is questionable."
WCPFC11,301,"Dr Hampton from SPC asked whether there is any commitment in this proposal to making this data available historically for stock assessment purposes. Depending on the interpretation of the para on data handling, the data provided would be useful immediately for the Commission rather than 10 or 15 years down the track after the data has been provided cumulatively."
WCPFC11,302,"Japan noted that there are legal constraints in provision of operational data according to the current scientific data rules. The main Asian distant water fishing members have domestic rules which prohibit the provision of operational data to the Commission, which is why there is an exemption clause in the rules. These domestic rules are not just regulated by the fishery authority but also by other authorities, therefore it is very hard to change the situation. However, these CCMs have sought to accommodate the concerns of the SIDS not only for the purpose of stock management but also for the purpose of cooperation to SIDS under Article 30 of the Convention. Japan explained that these CCMs’ had made a commitment to start to provide the operational data to the Commission and asked that the proposal be considered in good faith. In relation to historical data, this proposal only stipulates future provision of data. However, these CCMs understood the importance of historical data and consider very positively the provision of historical data. Japan understood that one CCM recently began providing operational data, together with some degree of historical data. 46"
WCPFC11,303,"Korea said it was happy to join the agreement to supply operational data, noting that it was harder for some other CCMs."
WCPFC11,304,"EU noted that its question about the footnote was not answered. By the time the grace period ends, the measure ends. The EU also asked why the proponents want these provisions to sit within the tropical tuna measure and not the data provision measure, which doesn’t expire in 2017 and is a permanent obligation. It would be preferable to amend the data provision measure instead."
WCPFC11,305,Japan noted that that the proposed arrangement has the footnote for some Asian distant water fishing members which have real practical difficulties in providing operational level data from 2015. Japan explained that the proposed arrangement is the result of discussions among many members and asked CCMs to respect the Asian distant water fishing members’ positive intention towards the data provision.
WCPFC11,306,"One CCM thanked the CCMs which put the measure together. This CCM explained that this was a small step – a number of stocks are not covered and it does not provide all the data other countries are providing. This CCM hoped the data could be made more robust, and in a rapid fashion, and sought clarification on whether the 1x1 would be provided on a monthly basis, and if so this was a clarification that might be useful in the text."
WCPFC11,307,"Japan confirmed it was monthly and provided in accordance with the data rules. Original language is annual, but the intention is for 1x1 data monthly."
WCPFC11,308,"FFA members thanked Japan for its leadership and for noting the concerns of others. This was a big compromise for FFA members too and they considered this a starting point, not the end point. The scientists are being provided with the data necessary for them to do their work. WCPFC11-2014-DP06 attempted to change the rules but it was clear it would not receive consensus agreement; as the alternative, this was a good start."
WCPFC11,309,Japan assured CCMs there was no intention to seek a loophole.
WCPFC11,310,"The EU commented that it would not oppose adoption if others are satisfied, but noted a preference for the FFA proposal (WCPFC11-2014-DP06). This CCM expressed disappointment with the lack of a certain delegation to abide by obligations which have existed for many years and hoped work continues in the future for full provision of operational data."
WCPFC11,311,"WCPFC11 agreed that the four paragraphs and two footnotes in WCPFC11-2014-DP26_rev2 as they were amended on-screen would be included in a revision of CMM 2013-01. The agreed paragraphs would be inserted after paragraph 55 and within a new section III titled ‘Data Provision Requirements’ (Attachment F, CMM 2014-01 Conservation and Management Measure for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack in the WCPO). Addressing outstanding matters in CMM 2013-01"
WCPFC11,312,"The Chair returned discussions in plenary on 5 December to CMM 2013-01. Referring participants to para 25 of CMM 2013-01 on high seas purse seine effort limits, the Chair noted that the Commission was required to review these limits at its meeting in 2014 and agree on high seas purse effort limits to apply after 2014. The Chair suggested that the 47  mentions of 2014 in this para should be amended to 2015 so the limits remain effective, noting that everything will stay the same except the year."
WCPFC11,313,"WCPFC11 agreed to replace references to “2014” with “2015” in paragraphs 25, 28, 29 and 43. (Attachment F, CMM 2014-01 Conservation and Management Measure for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack in the WCPO)."
WCPFC11,314,Indonesia reiterated its proposal to add Indonesia to para 55 of CMM 2013-01:  “55. Nothing in this measure shall restrict the ability of SIDS to construct or purchase vessels from other CCMs for their domestic fleets.”
WCPFC11,315,"Japan statedthat there remain some very significant issues to be solved and the Commission needs to work intersessionally, noting the serious status of the most important fishing resources in the region. Japan sought to clarify its understanding that paragraphs 14, 15 and 16 in CMM 2013-01 will continue to 2015 with respect to the management and use of FADs."
WCPFC11,316,"A number of CCMs viewed positively the progress made on operational level data provision, though one CCM noted that it was about the only positive thing the meeting achieved."
WCPFC11,317,"PNA members noted that their efforts tried to add value, but perhaps all that was added is more disproportionate burden. PNA members brought a number of issues to the Commission again, but these proposals were not taken up. These CCMs stated that aside from a small amount of closure on operational data, this meeting has seen a rejection of PNA’s efforts and of the SIDS’ interests in the sustainability of the tuna fisheries and their future."
WCPFC11,318,"Some CCMs expressed concern about bigeye tuna, with one CCM disappointed that FAD sets on the high seas were not banned as such FAD sets impinge on the biological status of bigeye tuna stocks."
WCPFC11,319,"The EU made three points: a) some of these issues were not discussed – they were not necessarily rejected; b) a point which is made every year is about the impact of fishing on FADs in the high seas, but catches of bigeye tuna in the high seas are very limited compared to the catches in the EEZ, so even a total ban on FAD fishing in the High Seas will not bring the expected positive impact on the rebuilding of the stock; c) regarding the idea to not apply a fourth month FAD closure but impose a fee on the use of FADs, which according to the proponents would have a conservation impact comparable or better than an actual closure, this delegation could not go along with that because there was no scientific evidence; so this CCM could not support the proposal because of conservation concerns."
WCPFC11,320,"USA noted that some issues were raised for that delegation and Participating Territories, and reminded participants that in thinking of the measures the Commission has to think about, the Participating Territory American Samoa is quite dependent on the high seas. This CCM reiterated that the Participating Territories must be borne in mind as well."
WCPFC11,321,Japan stated it was the fault of all CCMs that little progress was made at WCPFC11. Japan reminded the Commission how much effort was allocated to discussions about 48  conservation and management of the tropical tunas – last year the discussions on revision of tropical tunas measure had begun the day before the meeting and finished on the last day spending most of the time while this year CCMs allocated themselves perhaps one or two days for discussions.
WCPFC11,322,"Kiribati reiterated its position on the proposal to move forward on FAD closures on the high seas and management of high seas effort, and reminded CCMs of the special case of Kiribati when looking at this issue."
WCPFC11,323,"Resuming the discussions on CMM 2013-01 after 3:25pm on 5 December, the Vice-Chair observed the mixture of disappointment and mild satisfaction of participants with CMM 2013-01 discussions, and noted that it was unfortunate that the Commission had not resolved a number of issues. However, she suggested that this discussion should simply be an ongoing one. CCMs will have to meet between this meeting and the next meeting and hopefully find some middle ground and bring proposals forward that are well considered. The Vice-Chair noted that this was really the Commission’s main task."
WCPFC11,324,"FSM asked for clarity around what the tropical tuna measure would look like for 2015, noting that there were some agreed amendments."
WCPFC11,325,"At the request of the Vice-Chair the Interim-Executive Director reconfirmed that the amendments that had been agreed to CMM 2013-01 so far, were:  Edits to four paragraphs (paras 25, 28, 29 and 43) to replace references to 2014 with a reference to 2015;  and  To include a new section in CMM 2013-01 based on the discussion of the four paragraphs in WCPFC11-2014-DP25_rev2; the new section would be added after paragraph 55."
WCPFC11,326,"CCMs noted other provisions in CMM 2013-01, noting that these also needed to be further discussed and possibly amended. These included: a. Noting that the last sentence in para 56 could be simply changed to 2015; b. If amendments were required to paras 40 and 41 on longline catch allocations; c. If amendments or decisions had been been made to paragraphs 26, 15 and 50; and d. Whether para 15 can be amended to specify that the FAD closure should be based on UTC time."
WCPFC11,327,"The Interim-Executive Director responded that whilst there have been proposals tabled at WCPFC11 on these matters, which were discussed in the CMM 2013-01 working group, it was not the Secretariat’s understanding that any changes to the above paragraphs had yet been agreed at WCPFC11. For example,  in the SWG there was some support for including a reference to confirm that the FAD closure periods should be UTC time, but as the working group did not come back to plenary with agreed text, at this stage the Secretariat did not understand that any other changes had yet been agreed."
WCPFC11,328,Some CCMs stated their understanding that the arrangements related to disproportionate burden in paragraph 15 of CMM 2014-01 had not been agreed at WCPFC11.  Consequently the fifth month FAD closure and alternative FAD set limits in paragraph 17 would not apply until such time as these arrangements are agreed by the Commission.   49
WCPFC11,329,The Vice-Chair remarked that these issues were not being reopened but the discussion was to ensure there is a common understanding about what applies in 2015.  AGENDA  ITEM  7  -  REPORT OF THE TENTH SESSION  OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE 7.1 Report of the tenth regular session of the Scientific Committee (SC10)
WCPFC11,330,"The SC Chair, Mr Ludwig Kumoru (PNG), highlighted key issues from the Executive Summary of the SC10 report (WCPFC11-2014-16b_rev 1) for the attention of the Commission. SC10 was held in Majuro, Republic of Marshall Islands from 6 – 14 August 2014. The SC Chair explained that recommendations to SC or recommendations relating to the work of the Scientific Services Provider, SPC, would not be presented unless they carried financial implications.  Data and statistics theme"
WCPFC11,331,"Regarding the inclusion of a reference to Section 6 of “Scientific Data to be provided to the Commission” in any revision of CMM 2012-05 (paragraph 82.b, SC10 Summary Report), the WCPFC Chair noted that there is currently no proposal to modify this measure, but proposed that when the measure is next re-opened, this recommendation be taken into account."
WCPFC11,332,"Regarding feedback from industry on purse seine catch sampling (paragraph 100.b, SC10 Summary Report), the WCPFC Chair urged CCMs and those industry groups present to contact the Secretariat to obtain information about the spill sampling approach, and to provide feedback to Secretariat on the implications and constraints to moving to such an approach."
WCPFC11,333,"Regarding the submission of ROP-defined observer data (paragraph 120.b, SC10 Summary Report), the Commission was informed that this year’s CMR process took this matter into account."
WCPFC11,334,The Commission noted the support of SC10 for e-reporting and e-monitoring in paragraph 139 of the SC10 Summary Report. Stock Assessment Theme
WCPFC11,335,"Dr Shelton Harley (SPC-OFP) briefly presented the results of seven stock assessments conducted in 2014 by SPC and ISC, and highlighted the current status and management advice as follows.  Bigeye tuna"
WCPFC11,336,Stock status is detailed in paragraphs 186-192 of the SC10 Summary Report. The spawning biomass of WCPO bigeye tuna breached the biomass LRP in 2012. SC10 advised that the stock was overfished and rebuilding would require a reduction in fishing mortality. 50
WCPFC11,337,"Management advice is found in paras 193-200 of the SC10 Summary Report. SC10 recommended that:   fishing mortality on WCPO bigeye tuna be reduced. A 36% reduction in fishing mortality from the average levels for 2008–2011 would be expected to return the fishing mortality rate to FMSY. This reduction of at least 36% should also allow the stock to rebuild above the LRP over a period of time. This recommended level of reduction in fishing mortality could also be stated as a minimum 33% reduction from the 2004 level of fishing mortality, or a minimum 26% reduction from the average 2001–2004 level of fishing mortality.  all operational data, including high seas data, should be made available for future stock assessments.   the Commission consider the results of updated projections at WCPFC11, including an evaluation of the potential impacts of CMM 2013-01, to determine whether the CMM will achieve its objectives and allow the bigeye tuna stock to rebuild above the LRP. Yellowfin tuna"
WCPFC11,338,Stock status is found in paragraphs 244-251 of the SC10 Summary Report. SC10 concluded that yellowfin spawning biomass is above the biomass-based LRP that WCPFC adopted of 0.2SBF=0 and overall fishing mortality appears to be below FMSY. It is highly likely that the stock is not experiencing overfishing and is not in an overfished state.
WCPFC11,339,"Management advice is found in paras 252-257 of the SC10 Summary Report. SC10 recommended that the catch of WCPO yellowfin tuna should not be increased from 2012 levels, which exceeded MSY, and measures should be implemented to maintain current spawning biomass levels until the Commission can agree on an appropriate target reference point. Skipjack tuna"
WCPFC11,340,"Stock status is found in paragraphs 303-318 of the SC10 Summary Report. Recent catches are slightly above MSY. The assessment continues to show that the stock is currently only moderately exploited (Fcurrent/FMSY = 0.61) and fishing mortality levels are sustainable. However, the continuing increase in fishing mortality and decline in stock size are recognized."
WCPFC11,341,"Management advice is found in paragraphs 314-318 of the SC10 Summary Report. SC10 recommended that:  further research on range contraction of skipjack tuna be conducted in the framework of Project 67.  the Commission take action to avoid further increases in fishing mortality and to keep the skipjack tuna stock around the current levels, with tighter purse seine control rules and advocates for the adoption of TRPs and harvest control rules.  the Commission consider the results of updated projections at WCPFC11, including the evaluation of the potential impacts of CMM 2013-01 in order to determine whether the CMM will achieve its objectives, including impacts of the skipjack tuna fishery on bigeye and yellowfin tunas.  51  South Pacific albacore tuna"
WCPFC11,342,"No stock assessment was undertaken in 2014. SC10 recommended that longline fishing mortality and longline catches be reduced to avoid further decline in the vulnerable biomass and possibly exceeding the biomass LRP, and so that economically viable catch rates can be maintained.  North Pacific albacore tuna"
WCPFC11,343,"In paragraph 362 of the SC10 Summary Report, SC10 noted that ISC provided conclusions that the North Pacific albacore stock is healthy and that current productivity is sufficient to sustain recent exploitation. There were no specific recommendations to the Commission on this stock.  Pacific bluefin tuna"
WCPFC11,344,"In paragraph 380 of the SC10 Summary Report, SC10 noted that the current (2012) Pacific bluefin biomass level is near historically low levels and experiencing high exploitation rates above all biological reference points except for Floss. There were no specific recommendations to the Commission on this stock. Western and Central North Pacific swordfish"
WCPFC11,345,"Paragraph 390 of the SC10 Summary Report reported that an assessment was undertaken for Western and Central North Pacific Ocean (WCNPO) swordfish. Based on the assessment update, the WCNPO stock is not currently overfished and is not experiencing overfishing. The WCNPO stock is not fully exploited. Blue shark in the North Pacific"
WCPFC11,346,"Advice for blue shark in the North Pacific was complex and two different methods were used to assess the stock. In paragraph 462 of the SC10 Summary Report, the North Pacific blue shark stock is likely not experiencing overfishing and likely not to be in an overfished condition. However, in paragraph 464, SC10 noted that there is substantial uncertainty in the model results and the Commission should be cautious in interpreting the results."
WCPFC11,347,"In paragraph 467 and 468 of the SC10 Summary Report, SC10 recommended that:  all targeted shark fisheries be required to submit management plans with robust catch limits to the Commission by WCPFC12; and  the catch and fishing effort on blue shark be carefully monitored, and 5% longline observer coverage and biological and ecological research continued."
WCPFC11,348,There was no discussion in relation to these recommendations. Other recently assessed stocks
WCPFC11,349,"The Commission received reports on other recently assessed stocks as follows:   52  a) Southwest Pacific swordfish (2013) The South Pacific swordfish assessment was highly sensitive to growth assumptions. Two different growth models, one from Australia (GA) and the other from Hawaii (GH), were included in alternative model runs. SC could not make a definitive statement about which of these two assumptions was more reliable. Assessment runs using the GA growth data indicated that overfishing was occurring but that the stock was not in an overfished state. Assessment runs using the GH growth data indicate that no overfishing is occurring and that the stock is not in an overfished state. b) Southwest Pacific striped marlin (2012)  The stock is fully exploited, is not experiencing overfishing, but may be overfished. c) North Pacific striped marlin (2012)  The stock is overfished and experiencing overfishing. d) Silky shark (2013) Overfishing is occurring. It is highly likely that the stock is in an overfished state.  e) Oceanic whitetip shark (2012) Overfishing is occurring and the stock is in an overfished state.  f) Pacific blue marlin (2013) The stock is not currently overfished and is not experiencing overfishing. However, the stock is nearly fully exploited."
WCPFC11,350,The Commission received a brief summary of stock status split into two groups:  a) Stabilize / Maintain / No increase:   Skipjack tuna  Yellowfin tuna  Southwest Pacific swordfish  Pacific Blue marlin b) Rebuild stock / Reduce catch:  Bigeye tuna  Pacific bluefin tuna  South Pacific albacore tuna  Southwest Pacific striped marlin  North Pacific striped marlin  Silky shark  Oceanic whitetip shark
WCPFC11,351,The Chair noted the number of species in the ‘rebuild’ column. 53
WCPFC11,352,"Korea expressed appreciation to SPC and member states that participated in the stock assessments for major tropical tuna species in the WCPO. It noted that the stock assessment for bigeye tuna shows that stock status is below the LRP and there is a growing need for conservation of the stock. Korea asked whether the Scientific Services Provider could further analyse the impact of the purse seine and longline fishery on bigeye tuna stock. In response, SPC pointed out that Figure BET4 in the SC10 Summary Report may best answer the question at this stage. This is an analysis of impact by region and by gear on the spawning biomass of bigeye tuna."
WCPFC11,353,"Japan expressed particular concern that current spawning stock biomass of bigeye has breached the LRP and the provisional catch taken by the purse seine fishery in 2013 was the highest on record. Japan noted that the number of FAD sets in 2013 still exceeded 2010 levels, even though SC10 reaffirmed the recommendation of SC8 that the Commission consider a reduction of the total number of FAD sets to the level no greater than those in the fishery in 2010. Japan also expressed its concerns on the continuing increase in fishing mortality and decline in stock size of skipjack tuna and reiterated that the high catches in the equatorial area is causing local depletion of skipjack tuna, thus. Japan is expecting quite a low catch of this species based on recent years catches in its coastal area. Japan reminded the Commission that NC10 sent its strong concerns to the Commission regarding the plight of tropical tuna stocks, not only because those species are being caught in northern areas but also the status of these stocks could impact management of other species through target shifts. Japan also reminded the Commission that NC10 requested the Commission to instruct SC11 to prioritize the work on determination of the designation of North Pacific blue shark as a northern stock."
WCPFC11,354,"China commented that the stock assessment for South Pacific albacore took place 3 years ago; all the management advice and recommendations are based on old stock assessments. It asked what follow-on activities were planned for South Pacific albacore in future years, noting that a good grounding is needed to develop appropriate management measures. China observed that the South Pacific albacore proposal being deliberated at WCPFC11 would set catch limits for this species, but WCPFC doesn’t have MSY or a stock status for the species."
WCPFC11,355,The Chair confirmed that the Scientific Services Provider will be working on a South Pacific albacore stock assessment in 2015. SC11 will receive and discuss the results of that assessment.
WCPFC11,356,"With reference to the figure of estimates of reduction in spawning potential of bigeye due to fishing (Figure BET4), Japan asked how to interpret 100% on the x-axis (impact) in the figure. SPC confirmed that the closer to 100% on that axis, the higher the proportion of spawning population has been removed due to fishing. 100% would mean no spawning biomass is left. SPC pointed out that for the total region it is just over 80%, which is where the estimate of stock status is obtained. In response to a follow-up question from Japan, SPC confirmed that the figure of estimates of reduction in spawning potential of skipjack tuna due to fishing (Figure SKJ4) shows that 80% of the spawning population of skipjack tuna in Region 4 and 5 has been removed due to fishing. In response to Korea’s query about whether Figure BET4 could include separation of impacts by vessel size category (small, medium and large scale vessels), SPC explained that the different fisheries are only separated into longline and purse seine, irrespective of size. However, ‘other’ refers to smaller scale fisheries which operate in the west of the region. 54  Management issues theme"
WCPFC11,357,"In 2013, the Commission tasked SC to undertake further work to inform a decision on risk. SC10 recommended that WCPFC11 identify the level of acceptable risk that should be applied to breaching an LRP for the key target species. SC10 noted that the UN Fish Stocks Agreement states that the risk of exceeding LRPs should be very low."
WCPFC11,358,The WCPFC Chair invited members to consider sending this recommendation to a small working group or deferring it until 2015.
WCPFC11,359,"FFA members stated, as they did at WCPFC10, that deciding a level of acceptable risk around breaching LRPs is a management issue and WCPFC cannot keep passing it back to SC. These CCMs noted that the Commission asked SC10 to clarify the implications of accepting alternative levels of risk, and SC10 has provided that guidance, which has been further considered by MOW3, and the Commission should make this decision."
WCPFC11,360,"SC10 reviewed work on shark LRPs and made two recommendations: a) That the Commission support the tiered, species-specific approach that is similar to that adopted for target species but noted that more work would be required to specify the values of the LRPs for key shark species, and to ensure consistency with article 10.1(c) of the Convention; b) That the Commission support the proposal to hold an expert working group to compile and review life history data for use in LRPs for sharks."
WCPFC11,361,"The WCPFC Chair noted that there is a USD 25,000 proposed workshop budget in the Commission budget."
WCPFC11,362,"The following recommendation in paragraph 565 of the SC10 Summary Report relates to papers that were presented at both SC10 and MOW3 to inform consideration of target reference points: 565.  Noting the request from the Commission for the scientific services provider to provide the third meeting of the Management Objectives Workshop (MOW3) with further analyses required to inform the Commission’s consideration and adoption of a TRPs and harvest control rules (HCR) at WCPFC 11, SC10 reviewed working paper SC10-MI-WP-09. SC10 also reviewed three working papers (SC10-MI-WP-02, SC10-MI-WP-03 and SC10-MI-WP-04) which had previously been presented to MOW2 together with a new analysis of the possibility of range contraction in the WCPO provided in working paper SC10-MI-WP-06. SC10 supported these analyses and recommends that WCPFC11 take the results of these papers into consideration when considering the adoption of any TRPs and HCRs for the key target species."
WCPFC11,363,The WCPFC Chair noted that this was discussed in the MOW and when the Commission considers the CMM proposals it should be aware of the advice provided in MOW3.
WCPFC11,364,"The SC Chair noted information in section 5.3 of CMM 2013-01, MOW3 papers, and the SPC presentation at WCPFC11 which should be used to inform consideration of the tropical tuna measure. 55  Ecosystem and bycatch mitigation theme"
WCPFC11,365,"Regarding an external review of the spatial ecosystem and population dynamics model (SEAPODYM) project in paragraph 598, the Commission endorsed this recommendation."
WCPFC11,366,"Regarding SC10 recommendations on shark mitigations in paragraph 625 a - d, the Commission responded as follows: a) SC10 recommends the Commission consider the analysis of longline shark mitigation methods (e.g. hook type, leader material, non-deployment of shallow hooks, and a prohibition on shark lines) presented in EB-WP-01, as well as additional modeling of combinations of these measures and post-release mortality if available, in order to inform WCPFC11’s further consideration of revising shark CMMs to incorporate shark mitigation requirements that reduce catch rates and at-vessel mortality."
WCPFC11,367,"The WCPFC Chair suggested that the work recommended in subparagraph a) should be considered when working on the shark proposals before the Commission. b) SC10 recommends the Commission task TCC with identifying barriers to implementing the mitigation methods raised in SC10-EB-WP-05 (e.g. costs, operational issues and safety), along with any considerations raised by WCPFC11, and develop solutions, where appropriate."
WCPFC11,368,"WCPFC11 agreed to add identifying barriers to implementing the mitigation methods raised in SC10-EB-WP-05 along with any considerations raised by WCPFC11, and develop solutions where appropriate, to TCC’s agenda. c) SC10 recommends the Commission note that SC will not be able to review the specification of the ratio of fin weight to shark weight as described in para 8 of CCM 2010-07 because of the lack of reliable data and of appropriate species- and fleet-specific methodology. d) SC10 recommends the Commission request that for CCMs that apply fin-to-carcass weight ratios, these CCMs report to the Commission the details of the methods used to estimate the ratio of shark fin-to-carcass weight and CCMs should encourage its purse seine and longline observers to collect data related to shark fin-to-carcass ratios. This information should be included in Part 2 of the Annual Reports to WCPFC."
WCPFC11,369,"The SC Chair noted in respect of recommendations in c) and d) in paragraph 625 of the SC10 Summary Report, that SC did not have sufficient information to review fin weight to shark weight ratios."
WCPFC11,370,"The EU highlighted SC’s view that it is impossible to monitor the fins to carcass ratio because of a lack of reliable data, and stated that this methodology does not work and the Commission should no longer use this way of monitoring whether finning is occurring or not."
WCPFC11,371,Japan noted the importance of data collection on shark fin ratios and expressed its intention to review the specification of the ratio based on the data in the future SC meeting.  56
WCPFC11,372,The Commission noted SC10’s priorities for shark research and that there were budgetary implications associated for a) and b) below: a) Monte Carlo simulation of mitigation options (see SC10-EB-WP-01 for details). b) Expert panel work on the identification of appropriate life history parameters for use in developing shark LRPs.  c) Desktop examination of fin-to-carcass ratios (building on work underway by New Zealand).
WCPFC11,373,SC10 identified several seabird research areas in paragraphs 661 and 662. The WCPFC Chair suggested that these research priorities could be discussed during the deliberations at WCPFC11 to modify the seabird measure. Other issues
WCPFC11,374,The Commission noted that SC10 and the Scientific Services Provider agreed that the 2015 service agreement will include the following: a. Pacific-wide bigeye stock assessment b. South Pacific albacore stock assessment c. Indicator analyses for key shark species d. Development of Shark Research Plan e. Update of stock assessment for WCPO bigeye incorporating 2013 data in projection mode.
WCPFC11,375,"Japan reminded the Commission of the NC10 request which had been adopted by the Commission regarding “the Commission to instruct SC11 to prioritize the work on determination of the designation of North Pacific blue shark as a northern stock, including a prompt establishment of criteria and process for the designation of northern stocks (paragraph 82, NC10 Summary Report).”"
WCPFC11,376,"The Interim-Executive Director advised that while the paragraph was adopted, it appears that the WCPFC does not currently hold the data necessary for this assessment to be undertaken. There is a problem with how this paragraph will be implemented. Japan responded that the NC also requested that the ISC to provide relevant information for the SC’s consideration of this issue at SC11 (paragraph 82, NC10 Summary Report)."
WCPFC11,377,"The WCPFC Chair encouraged CCMs which hold data on blue shark to pass that data to the Commission. SC11 will receive a report from ISC, noting WCPFC11 adopted para 82 of the NC10 report."
WCPFC11,378,"The Secretariat briefly introduced a proposal submitted by SC Chair and SC theme conveners to hire two additional rapporteurs for Scientific Committee meetings in order to free up the Convenors to concentrate on the scientific work of the Committee and leading their sessions, rather than drafting their theme reports. The proposal was costed at USD 40,000 to hire two additional professional support rapporteurs, including expenses. 57"
WCPFC11,379,"FFA members supported the approach as long as there are no additional costs associated. This could be achieved through greater use of Secretariat staff to provide support in the development of the SC report. These CCMs encouraged the SC to review its current structure and operations. Although restructured a few years ago, there is a need to develop mechanisms to ensure that the scientific advice being provided to the Commission is not politicised. Efficiency gains could be made by streamlining the meeting to focus on its core work and activities tasked by the Commission, to reduce the meeting length."
WCPFC11,380,"Several CCMs suggested that Secretariat staff can help, along with participating scientists as other RFMOs do, and that the proposal had significant budget implications."
WCPFC11,381,"Regarding the election of SC officers in paragraph 720, the WCPFC Chair reminded delegations that the Chair and Vice-Chair positions for SC are open and that there has not been an SC Vice-Chair for several years. FFA has recommended that the current Chair, Ludwig Kumoru (PNG), be re-elected to that position."
WCPFC11,382,The Chair confirmed that the next two SC meetings were proposed to be held in Pohnpei (2015) and Indonesia (2016). 7.2 Future work programme and budget for 2015-2017
WCPFC11,383,"The SC Chair noted that the following items in the SC budget are changes, and highlighted:  Project 35: an increase of USD 50,000 to begin analysing bigeye samples collected.  Project 57: workshop for developing limit reference points for sharks.  Project 74: proposed Pacific-wide stock assessment; extra costs relating to collaboration with IATTC and model developments.  Shark mitigation: work identified as high priority to help quantify potential impact of mitigation.  Project 67: examining data from skipjack fisheries outside the main tropical area."
WCPFC11,384,The WCPFC Chair noted that this will be considered at FAC.
WCPFC11,385,WCPFC11 accepted the Summary Report of the Tenth Regular Annual Session of the Scientific Committee.   58  AGENDA  ITEM  8  -  REPORT OF THE TENTH SESSION OF THE NORTHERN COMMITTEE 8.1 Report of the Tenth Regular Session of the Northern Committee (NC)
WCPFC11,386,"Mr Masanori Miyahara (Japan), NC Chair, summarized the outcomes of NC10 (WCPFC11-2014-17), which was held in Fukuoka, Japan, from 1-4 September 2014. Seven NC CCMs and eight observer CCMs participated. North Pacific bluefin"
WCPFC11,387,"After considering the latest ISC Pacific bluefin tuna stock assessment, NC10 adopted a draft CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna and submitted it to the Commission for adoption. The NC Chair noted that advice on Pacific bluefin tuna was very clear – there was only one way to ensure the recovery of this stock, a 50% reduction in Pacific bluefin tuna catch, sized less than 30kg from the 2002-2004 average levelsNC agreed to initial goal of rebuilding the SSB to the historical median within 10 years from 2015 with at least 60% probability. NC also agreed to consider and develop, at its meetings in 2015 and 2016, reference points and harvest control rules for the long-term management of Pacific bluefin tuna.  North Pacific albacore"
WCPFC11,388,"The NC Chair reported ISC’s latest stock assessment for North Pacific albacore, which showed the stock is healthy and current productivity is sufficient to sustain the recent level of exploitation, assuming average historical recruitment continues. NC10 adopted a decision regarding the precautionary management framework for North Pacific albacore. North Pacific swordfish"
WCPFC11,389,"The NC Chair reported ISC’s latest stock assessment for North Pacific swordfish, which showed that the stock is not subject to overfishing, nor overfished. As a result, discussion on a management framework was deferred until the North Pacific albacore work is completed and endorsed by the Commission. Other issues"
WCPFC11,390,"The NC Chair also noted the following issues considered by NC10:  Tropical tuna species: NC10 again expressed strong concern regarding tropical tuna stocks, not only because those species are being caught in the Northern area but also because the status of those species could impact management of other species through target shift.  Sharks: NC10 agreed to request the Commission to instruct SC to prioritize the work on determination of the designation of North Pacific blue shark as a northern stock, including a prompt establishment of criteria and process for the designation of northern stock. NC10 requested ISC to provide relevant information for SC’s consideration.  North Pacific Striped Marlin: No discussion.  Seabirds: NC10 agreed to encourage NC members to provide necessary information to evaluate the effect of the exemption of seabird mitigation measure for small scale vessels.  Sea turtles: No discussion.   Regional Observer Programme: NC members were requested to review the implementation of the ROP in the NC area and report to NC11. 59   Vessel Monitoring System: No discussion."
WCPFC11,391,"The NC Chair reported on other matters and noted the following:  NC will continue to review the current management framework for North Pacific albacore through 2015-2016, then consider the results of the new stock assessment in 2017, at which time the NC will overhaul the current management measures.   If the Commission adopts the draft CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna, NC proposes in 2015 to review CCM reports on domestic management and trade. In 2016 there will be a new stock assessment. NC may need to consider emergency measures in the event the stock assessment shows a recruitment drop. NC may also consider a CDS for Pacific bluefin.  Masanori Miyahara (Japan) and Mike Tosatto (USA) were nominated as Chair and Vice-Chair candidates, respectively, through NC12.   Japan offered to host NC11 in early September 2015 at a place to be confirmed.  Upon verification of Fiji’s catch reports by SC11, Fiji will become a new member of NC."
WCPFC11,392,The NC Chair submitted Attachment C of the NC10 report draft Conservation and Management Measure to establish a multi-annual rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin tuna for the Commission’s consideration and adoption (WCPFC11-2014-18).
WCPFC11,393,Several CCMs supported the draft CMM being formally adopted by WCPFC11.
WCPFC11,394,"Chinese Taipei stated that Pacific bluefin is an important species to this CCM and the Commission, and expressed concern about the species’ stock status, noting that the stock biomass is close to historic low levels. This CCM reiterated the ISC advice that the decline of spawning stock biomass is mostly impacted by the taking of too many juveniles. Adoption of the draft CMM was necessary to reduce juvenile catch to 2002-2004 levels."
WCPFC11,395,"Canada offered views on two NC stocks: a) Pacific bluefin – the existing measure is only in place for 2014 and with the stock status less than 4% of its unfished biomass, a comprehensive measure was needed. The draft CMM includes short term measures, particularly reducing fishing mortality of juveniles and, over the longer term, the development of a stock rebuilding programme, and should work well with the IATTC measure; b) North Pacific albacore – the 2014 ISC stock assessment shows the stock in quite a healthy state, making it an opportune time to begin discussions on management frameworks. Progress was made at NC to agree to an LRP, an overall management objective, and some decision rules if the LRP is breached. An LRP of 20% of the spawning stock biomass was agreed. This CCM was pleased with progress towards a management strategy evaluation, noting synergies between NC management objectives work and the MOW."
WCPFC11,396,"Japan noted that the draft measure for Pacific bluefin was adopted at NC considering the stock status, which is currently at its historically lowest level. Japan reminded the Commission that IATTC was requested to introduce a compatible measure in the eastern Pacific Ocean and it has adopted measures for 2015-2016, introducing a 40% reduction of the commercial catch in October 2014. To facilitate a rapid recovery of the stock, Japan urged the Commission to adopt the draft measure recommended by NC. Japan reported to the Commission that in March 2014, the government of Japan decided to reduce its catches of Pacific bluefin tuna less than 30 kg to 50% of the 2002-2004 annual average level from 2015 and held consultations at more than 50 sites across Japan with its fishermen to explain to them the importance of the managementJapan also reported that it is developing a timely monitoring system.  60"
WCPFC11,397,"FFA members expressed appreciation for the focus on future management to rebuild the stock to desirable levels, and noted the strong link between the Pacific bluefin rebuilding plan and the harvest strategies FFA have proposed for all major stocks. FFA members also supported the recommended management arrangement for North Pacific albacore, and were pleased to see the recommendation of a spawning stock biomass LRP, which is consistent with the Commission’s decisions on skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye and South Pacific albacore. These CCMs noted that SC has raised concerns about aspects of the stock assessment for North Pacific albacore and looked forward to continued improvement to allow the management strategy evaluation approach anticipated by the NC. 8.1.1 Recommendations and advice"
WCPFC11,398,WCPFC11 adopted CMM 2014-04: Conservation and Management Measure to establish a multi-annual rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin tuna (Attachment G).
WCPFC11,399,"In response to NC10s request, WCPFC11 agreed to task SC11 to prioritise work on determining the designation of North Pacific blue shark as a northern stock, including establishing a criteria and process for the designation of northern stocks. WCPFC11 noted that the NC has requested the ISC to provide relevant information for the SC’s consideration of this issue at SC11."
WCPFC11,400,"Mexico noted that it expects that countries involved in the fishery will take the necessary steps to ensure the CMM is effective. However, Mexico expressed its concern that the measures are not sufficient and voiced concerns along the following lines: a) ISC advice on juvenile catch warned NC that reductions should be effected not only on Pacific bluefin tunas weighing less than 30 kg, but across the range of juvenile sizes; therefore the CMM adopted does not take account of the scientific advice. Mexico expressed the hope that WCPFC considers this management advice next year, and noted that reducing catch for juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna allows fleets catching bigger tunas to increase their catches, so the benefit to the stock will be lower than expected; c) adult Pacific bluefin also urgently requires protection; d) protecting the spawning stock biomass, estimated to be below 5%, is urgently required, since it is doubtful that such low levels will produce high recruitments."
WCPFC11,401,"The EU expressed disappointment at the lack of ambition of the WCPFC Pacific bluefin measure and, while not opposing its adoption, noting delegations were not given a chance to change it, considered that the Commission could have done better than rebuilding the stock to its historical median spawning biomass within 10 years with a 60% probability. As the Pacific bluefin stock has been heavily depleted for many years, the measure is not expected to have a sufficient impact on the rebuilding of the stock. WCPFC should have aimed at rebuilding the stock to a higher percentage of the unfished biomass. This CCM noted that member countries of ICCAT jointly agreed to significant catch reductions on bluefin tuna; they decided collectively to take an ambitious approach that is bearing tangible results. The EU expressed the view that WCPFC is not on the same track. 8.2 Future work programme for Northern Committee"
WCPFC11,402,There was no specific discussion on this item.
WCPFC11,403,WCPFC11 accepted the Summary Report of the Tenth Regular Annual Session of the Northern Committee.  61   AGENDA  ITEM  9  -  REPORT OF THE TENTH TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE 9.1 Report of the Tenth Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC10)
WCPFC11,404,"Ms Rhea Moss-Christian (FSM), TCC Chair, summarized the outcomes of TCC10, held 25-30 September 2014 in Pohnpei, FSM.  9.1.1 Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures - Report on Compliance Monitoring Scheme"
WCPFC11,405,"The TCC Chair noted that Agenda item 9.1.1 also relates to the Provisional Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR) which TCC10 adopted and has forwarded to the Commission for adoption. During WCPFC11 reviews of compliance scores for individual CCMs as contained in the Provisional CMR, taking into account any new information submitted by CCMs 30 days before WCPFC11, would be done through a small working group led by the TCC Vice-Chair."
WCPFC11,406,"The TCC Chair advised that in addition to the Provisional Compliance Report, there were two groups of recommendations from TCC10 related to the Compliance Monitoring Scheme which should be considered by the Commission: those which were substantive and those which were process or administration-related. She also noted that there were some ROP-related CMR recommendations made by TCC10, but noted that TCC10 has recommended these matters be forwarded to the IWG-ROP for further discussion and resolution, rather than being tabled for discussion at this Commission regular session.  Substantive Recommendations arising from the Compliance Monitoring Scheme process"
WCPFC11,407,"The TCC Chair advised that this group of recommendations related to matters where there was some difficulty at TCC, due to differing interpretations among CCMs. While compliance scores were made in 2014 by TCC, and are reflected in the Provisional Compliance Monitoring Report recommended by TCC10, difficulties had been noted in the Executive Summary and in the TCC10 summary report. TCC10 is seeking guidance and decisions on interpretation of these obligations to assist them in future compliance reviews.  i. TCC10 recommends that WCPFC11 discuss the difference in interpretation of paragraph 3 of Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission, as a priority concern with a view to resolving this as soon as possible (para 55)."
WCPFC11,408,The TCC Chair noted that the issue of operational and aggregated data provision has been an issue for TCC in conducting its compliance assessments for at least two years.
WCPFC11,409,"In response to a query from the Chair about whether this issue would be covered by the measure being brought forward by the FFA, RMI confirmed this was likely and discussion could take place under negotiations of the measure, and then brought back to the group."
WCPFC11,410,"Japan stated that it fully recognizes the importance of operational data in terms of science, thus has established a cooperative arrangement with SPC through which its operational data is used for stock assessments. Japan also stated that compliance in provision of 62  operational data should be discussed based on the related paragraph in the data provision rule. Japan reminded the Commission that the related paragraph in the data provision rule (Section 3) stipulates CCMs which cannot provide operational data due to domestic legal constraints shall provide aggregated data and concluded that non-provision of operational data itself does not constitute non-compliance as long as aggregated data are provided.  ii. TCC10 recommends that WCPFC11 should discuss the interpretation of paragraph 10 of CMM 2012-01 with respect to the obligations and how those obligations should be assessed for compliance (para 64(iii))."
WCPFC11,411,"The TCC Chair noted that in relation to para 10 of CMM 2012-01 (FAD closures), there were questions around what constitutes compliance and how it should be assessed."
WCPFC11,412,"In response to a query from the Chair, the TCC Vice-Chair, Alexa Cole (USA), advised that this issue related to cases when a CCM’s vessel was found to be in violation of the measure, and at what point the CCM becomes compliant. The TCC Vice-Chair advised that she was clarifying this in the proposed CMM for Compliance Monitoring Scheme she was drafting, which makes it clear that in investigating or prosecuting and taking the necessary steps as a flag state, they would be compliant."
WCPFC11,413,The EU stated that it had a different view of how this measure should be interpreted and would discuss this with other members in the small working group.
WCPFC11,414,"Japan requested that the Commission should also discuss how to implement the definition of a FAD practically during the FAD closure period. Japan stated that para 3 of CMM 2009-02 provides that the FAD can be an object of any size and extreme implementation of the definition led to several members being alleged to be non-compliant with the FAD closure requirement at TCC10. Japan stressed that it was not challenging the FAD definition itself but wanted to open up a discussion about its practical implementation in the Commission. In response to a question, Japan responded that rigorous application of the FAD definition to purse seine fishing will stop its operation in the FAD closure period because if even the smallest object is observed, which is impossible to spot during the set, after the set the vessel could be alleged to contravene FAD closure requirement."
WCPFC11,415,PNA members noted that the third PNA Implementing Arrangement and its implementation in their national waters should also be a consideration in these matters. iii. TCC10 recommends that WCPFC11 should discuss the interpretation of paragraph 48 of CMM 2013-01 with respect to the obligation to provide the necessary catch and effort data and how these obligations should be assessed at TCC11 for compliance (para 64(iv)).
WCPFC11,416,"The Interim-Executive Director advised that para 48 is one of three paras in CMM 2013-01 that relate to ‘other commercial fisheries for skipjack, bigeye and yellowfin’ (gears and fisheries, other than purse seine and longline fisheries). She observed that the challenge TCC and the Secretariat faces in this section is that the limits that are placed on ‘other commercial fisheries’ in CMM 2013-01 are: level of fishing effort or capacity or vessel numbers, however, in general the information that is made available has been catch data. Under the requirements of CMM 2013-01, CCMs subject to those limits should be providing catch and effort data.  63"
WCPFC11,417,"Referring to para 3 and in relation to para 48, FFA members supported the view that all catches of tropical tuna, whether target or bycatch, and regardless of the fishing method, should be reported. FFA members sought the Commission’s endorsement of this."
WCPFC11,418,"One CCM stated that based on its own reading of the text it relates to the targeting of tropical tuna, and bycatch data was not required. Japan supported this and observed that assessments of compliance should be based on requirements as clearly written. It was observed that this data was of scientific importance."
WCPFC11,419,"SPC offered advice to assist discussions about what species might be provided in these data. It was important to consider bycatch species even when analyzing tropical tuna data, as differential targeting was taken into account. Without the species catches in the data it is difficult to do that. The Chair observed that if the Commission wants SPC to provide the best stock assessments, CCMs as a group had to give them the best data possible."
WCPFC11,420,"One CCM recognized the importance of data for scientific work but concurred that this was about compliance. According to the context of the measure, it was made very clear in para 47 and 48 that the focus was on commercial tuna fishing. Those data from tuna fisheries should be provided to the Commission. This CCM stated that it has provided as much bycatch data to SPC and the Commission as is available. iv. TCC10 recommends that WCPFC11 provide advice to CCMs on interpretation of paragraph 8 of CMM 2009-03 (para 64(v))."
WCPFC11,421,"The TCC Chair noted that this recommendation relates to issues of interpretation around whether the reporting requirement applies to target fisheries, bycatch fisheries or both, and has been a repeat issue for TCC. The TCC Vice-Chair supplemented that this stems from the provisional CMR and relates to whether the requirement is for CCMs to report all swordfish catches (targeted catches and bycatch) by their vessels in the applicable area, or if CCMs only report catches of their vessels targeting swordfish."
WCPFC11,422,The Chair noted that para 8 of the measure states: “CCMs shall report to the Commission the total number of vessels that fished for swordfish and the total catch of swordfish”.
WCPFC11,423,"One CCM stated that in their view the measure’s purpose is to regulate the targeted fishing for swordfish, and only catches of vessels targeting swordfish should be reported."
WCPFC11,424,"Some other CCMs stated the opposite view, and noted that para 8 talks about both “the number of vessels that fish for swordfish” (referring to the number of vessels targeting swordfish) with the second part requiring that CCMs report “the total catch of swordfish.” The latter part is not limited to just the vessels, and so the total catch of swordfish should be comprised of both target and bycatch fisheries. These CCMs confirmed their understanding that CCMs whose vessels have caught swordfish in the area south of 20˚S and who have provided a report of total catches by their vessels, both targeted or bycatches, should be assessed as compliant with the reporting obligation in CMM 2009-03 para 8."
WCPFC11,425,"The CCM that had initially expressed a contrary view, confirmed that it can go along with this interpretation, and acknowledged that the second sentence creates an obligation for CCMs to report both targeted and bycatch catches of swordfish."
WCPFC11,426,The Interim-Executive Director and Compliance Manager asked the Commission to note that this is a reporting obligation for CCMs to provide certain information in their Part 1 64  Annual Reports and asked the Commission to confirm that the information in para 8 of CMM 2009-03 should be included by CCMs in that report next year. It was broadly understood among CCMs that they would do so.
WCPFC11,427,"The Chair closed discussion on this series of recommendations, noting that there was now a common understanding of the reporting obligation as contained in CMM 2009-03 paragraph 8."
WCPFC11,428,The Chair asked the small working group led by the TCC Vice-Chair to come back to plenary with recommendations on ways forward for the first three matters discussed here (CMM 2012-01 paragraph 10; CMM 2012-01 paragraph 30 and Scientific Data to be Provided paragraph 3).  Process-Related or Administrative Recommendations for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme process.
WCPFC11,429,The TCC Chair noted that these recommendations were for the Commission to agree on maintaining certain processes that TCC has adopted in compiling the provisional CMR.
WCPFC11,430,"Taking into consideration the CMS process-related recommendations from TCC10, WCPFC11 agreed the following: i. WCPFC11 noted that TCC10, as with TCC9, found conducting the review on an obligation by obligation basis both useful and informative. WCPFC11 agreed that improvements to this process should continue to be made, taking into account the recommendations of the 2014 Final CMR report (para 56).  ii. WCPFC11 noted there were difficulties experienced at TCC in the interpretation of some CMMs, WCPFC11 agreed that all new CMMs should be drafted with clear criteria as to the nature of the obligation and how compliance with that obligation will be assessed (para 57). iii. WCPFC11 agreed that CCMs will confirm if they have nothing to report on obligations when completing Annual Reports to make it clear to the Secretariat that this obligation has been considered (para 59).  iv. Noting that a number of CNMs have high levels of non-compliance, WCPFC11 agreed to consider the compliance status of CNMs in the granting of CNM status and their participatory rights for 2015 (para 60).  v. Noting that TCC10 advised that CCMs consider that exceeding catch and effort limits and non-provision of Annual Reports are priority issues for the Commission to consider in the CMR, WCPFC11 agreed that in future reviews, non-compliance with these obligations should be assessed as “priority non-compliant” (para 61). vi. WCPFC11 agreed that in future reviews where there are technological constraints in implementing a measure, an assessment of “non-compliant” is appropriate (para 62).  vii. WCPFC11 agreed to prioritize the obligations that will be assessed (para 63)."
WCPFC11,431,"Noting that the Commission had agreed to prioritize the obligations that will be assessed by CMR, the TCC Chair advised that the Commission should also discuss priorities for TCC11. 65"
WCPFC11,432,"USA noted that in the draft CMM on the CMS, proposed language is that each year the Commission may add or subtract measures from para 3,  giving the Commission the opportunity but not the obligation to choose."
WCPFC11,433,"The Chair suggested that instead of undertaking the exercise of prioritizing what CMM obligations will be assessed next year, the Commission could deal with them in the draft measure and if the measure is then adopted the Commission could do this next year. During WCPFC11, a list of obligations to be assessed was finalised and agreed. WCPFC11 also considered a number of other CMS process-related recommendations, see Agenda item 10.9.1 and 10.9.2."
WCPFC11,434,"The TCC Chair stressed the need to make changes to the CMS. Noting that TCC has trialed different processes and also had some substantial outcomes, there is frustration about whether these processes are getting the Commission closer to a scheme which would be more helpful to its work and realize the objectives of the scheme. The TCC Chair thanked New Zealand and RMI for leading the CMS small working group, noting that issues of interpretation also took up a lot of time. The TCC Chair made the observation that TCC couldn’t repeat the volume of this year’s work next year, a volume which has doubled if not tripled. The Secretariat has successfully put a system in place to collate the large volume of information and help the committee get through it. Notwithstanding that, the process took too long. The TCC Chair urged the Commission to take up these issues, which will assist the TCC’s work in future years."
WCPFC11,435,"The WCPFC Chair noted that he was impressed with the amount of work completed. He observed that if so much time and energy is going to be committed, the Commission needs to make sure it is deriving significant benefit from the process. Provisional CMR and Executive Summary"
WCPFC11,436,"The TCC Vice-Chair, Alexa Cole (USA), presented the Provisional CMR and Executive Summary, reporting that the CMS-SWG working group had met in two sessions to assess the extra information which had been provided by CCMs after TCC10. Finalisation of the CMR was pending decisions on the outstanding substantive recommendations from TCC10 related to matters of interpretation of certain CMMs and decisions, which had not yet come back to plenary, including the operational data CMM. Resolution of those issues may require compliance status changes."
WCPFC11,437,"After consultations during WCPFC11, the TCC Vice-Chair reported that a draft of the final Compliance Monitoring Report (final CMR) was completed and the SWG-CMS was working to update the matrix and associated tables to reflect the outcomes, and an executive summary."
WCPFC11,438,"Referring to the final CMR and noting paragraph 3, New Zealand congratulated Niue, Tokelau, Nauru and Tonga for achieving ‘compliant’ status, making the point that these are some of WCPFC’s smallest members."
WCPFC11,439,"Noting the large number of non-compliant countries in the Final CMR, Japan requested the TCC Vice-Chair to explain to the Commission how the SWG-CMS approached the review of non-compliance statuses for CCMs who were not able to attend the SWG.  66"
WCPFC11,440,"The Chair observed that the CMR process can help the Commission find out if it has adopted measures that are practically impossible to comply with, or if there are certain parts of them that are practically impossible, but could be fixed."
WCPFC11,441,"On 5 December, the TCC Vice-Chair introduced section B of WCPFC11-2014-31, which considered the three outstanding substantive recommendations from TCC10 related to matters of interpretation of certain CMMs and decisions. This document contained draft recommendation text for the Commission to consider, including with suggestions of how TCC11 might approach these matters during 2015.  a. CMM 2012-01, Tropical Tuna measure, Para 10 – FADs:  There were questions as to if and when a CCM would be considered compliant if there were allegations of violations by its vessels. The SWG did not have time to fully address this, but there is proposed language in the draft CMM on the Compliance Monitoring Scheme on this language that seemed to have general support. The SWG recommended that “when there are alleged violations by a CCM’s vessels, the CCM will be deemed compliant, for the purposes of the Compliance Monitoring Report, when any alleged violations have been fully investigated and/or resolved [as much as practically possible] by charging or other appropriate resolution.”"
WCPFC11,442,"The CMS SWG Chair confirmed that the SWG’s recommendation intends to reflect how TCC addressed it this year, which was that CCMs were non-complaint until they had fully investigated the matter, which included receiving the observer report. This year, all CCMs that had investigations pending were deemed non-compliant, and this reflects the proposed language in Annex 1 of the revised measure. The CMS SWG Chair noted that the SWG seemed to reach agreement that members would be deemed compliant once they have completed that investigation, including receiving the observer report, and taken action."
WCPFC11,443,"There was a lively discussion about the considerations that should occur before a CCM is assessed by TCC as compliant or non-compliant. Some CCMs noted their view that a compliant rating can be given where a CCM says it has made best efforts to investigate with the limited information available. EU noted its disagreement with this interpretation, with the CCM still considering it an infraction, viewing as a separate issue the CCM taking steps. One CCM expressed the view that other rules are needed to decide whether alleged violations have been fully investigated."
WCPFC11,444,"One CCM noted that its recollection of the SWG’s discussion was that it was based on TCC: where there was an ongoing investigation, the status would be assessed non-compliant. This issue was resolved, and any wording would have to be to the satisfaction of the TCC."
WCPFC11,445,"One CCM supported Japan’s proposal, referring to Convention Articles 20 and 25(2) and noting that within two months the investigation should be finished but charging would take longer. This CCM expressed the view that this needs to be practical. If, in the beginning of September, a CCM receives some evidence, with TCC starting at the end of September there wouldn’t be time to finish the investigation, let alone charge, so in that particular year that country would be non-compliant. The Commission should avoid such a situation."
WCPFC11,446,"The Chair noted that there are some parts of the new measure on which it is going to be difficult to reach resolution. He suggested that the group could consider reaching an 67  agreement that we weren’t able to resolve these issues at this meeting and task the TCC Chair, Vice-Chair and Secretariat to improve the process in 2015."
WCPFC11,447,"The TCC Vice-Chair noted the pending compliance assessments, so the group only has the choices of “compliant”, “non-compliant”, or “not assessed” and cautioned that without a resolution, TCC will be bogged down next year. The TCC Vice-Chair urged a decision to be taken at least for the year going forward, in order to adopt the report at WCPFC11. The Chair asked the Commission to consider a decision that could assist the TCC during 2015, pending a longer-term resolution."
WCPFC11,448,"Several CCMs could not support this approach regardless of what had happened at TCC: One CCM stated that compliant or non-compliant is not clear, and judging from the legal process, in its case it was not non-compliant. Japan did not support it and stated that alleged non-compliance is equal to compliance under its legal system. Japan said the consequence of accepting this approach would be that at the next annual meeting the Commission will take action against it. Another noted that it was very important to receive complete reports from relevant coastal states."
WCPFC11,449,"One CCM clarified an earlier intervention, with the delegate explaining that he was not speaking to overall compliance scores but about TCC’s approach, which was to assess all of these obligations at that time. The working group’s conclusion was based on the factual approach that TCC took on this issue. Mindful of the time and the press of other business, one CCM suggested a temporary solution to assess the CCMs implicated here as ‘not able to be assessed’ and drop the recommendation for now and seek a compromise."
WCPFC11,450,"The Chair repeated his suggestion that the Commission agree that it could not agree and ask the TCC Chair, Vice-Chair and Secretariat to work on the issue in consultation with CCMs for a way forward. Some CCMs disagreed and stated that they were seeking a change in score from non-compliant to compliant."
WCPFC11,451,"Another CCM preferred to resolve the issue at this meeting and stated that fishing on FADs during closures is one of the main implementation issues in CMM 2013-01 and there is danger in a CCM not being assessed because the group cannot agree on an interpretation. In this CCM’s view it was fair to continue in the way decided at TCC10. If a CCM has not taken action where it would have been appropriate, it would be fair to consider the member non-compliant. This CCM expressed concern that the work of TCC could be endangered."
WCPFC11,452,"WCPFC11 agreed to not agree on those specific obligations, but continued to finalise the Final CMR report. b. CMM 2012-01, Tropical Tuna measure, Para 30: TCC10 recommended that WCPFC11 discuss the interpretation of paragraph 48 of CMM 2013-01 with respect to the obligation to provide the necessary catch and effort data and how these obligations should be assessed at TCC11 for compliance. c. Scientific data, paragraph 3: TCC10 recommended that WCPFC11 should discuss the different in interpretation of this paragraph as a priority matter  The SWG did not have a recommendation – this needs further discussion."
WCPFC11,453,The TCC Vice-Chair noted that the SWG could not agree on recommendations for b) and c) and explained that there was no final assessment or agreed language for these. 68
WCPFC11,454,"The TCC Vice-Chair noted that the next SWG recommendation was agreed language at CMS-SWG at TCC, and across the floor at TCC10, and so should be non-controversial.  The provisional Compliance Monitoring Report also included several agreed decisions from TCC10 on interpretation of measures that CCMs agreed would govern our future assessments: a. CMM 2007-01: Att K, Annex C, para 04, Regional Observer Programme   -TCC agreed that it will assess presence and absence of data b. CMM 2009-06 Para 11: Annex 2, Transshipment reporting -TCC agreed that when preparing Part 1 Annual Reports, CCMs will provide all required fields to the Secretariat for assessment. CCMs are non-compliant until satisfactory information is received. c. CMM 2009-06 Para 35a(iv), Transshipment -TCC agreed that it would continue to assess this obligation as it did at TCC10. d. CMM 2005-03 Para 2: North Pacific Albacore -TCC agreed that it would continue to assess this obligation as it did at TCC10]. e. CMM 2011-03 Para 5, Cetaceans -TCC agreed to include Para 2b in this assessment to ensure the reports in paragraph 5 reflect what is required in paragraph 2b. SWG recommendation:  WCPFC11 agrees that that the decisions of TCC10 in its Appendix 1 of preliminary Compliance Monitoring Report, detailed above, will apply to future compliance assessments on the obligations as specified"
WCPFC11,455,"A few CCMs noted that they objected to some of these TCC10 recommendations. Japan pointed out that these decisions were made for TCC11 assessment, thus could not support SWG recommendation that these decision will apply to future compliance assessment. The Chair noted that the CMS SWG Chair had advised that some agreements were reached this year at TCC10 and if the Commission does not agree the same issues will arise next year."
WCPFC11,456,"Other CCMs expressed surprise at hearing these views now, recalling the agreements and proposed ways forward at the CMS SWG. One delegation invited other delegations to have a constructive attitude to these negotiations and noted it was a big task to move forward and streamline the TCC, and not repeat discussions. Another CCM observed that there was a difference between reserving a compliance score and unravelling TCC’s work. This CCM recognized that a very large body of work went into this years’ CMR and expressed the view that the intervention had effectively rendered that work redundant."
WCPFC11,457,"In response, one CCM asked for clarification about not being able to overturn a TCC recommendation, asking if the Commission just endorses subsidiary body recommendation’s then in this CCM’s view we should not talk about these issues at all. The Commission has a right to overturn TCC decisions, although it should do that only when there is a demonstrated good cause for doing so, for the overall benefit of what the Commission is trying to accomplish. Another CCM noted that it was not here to undermine anything, but must protect itself, and suggested that TCC discuss it again next year."
WCPFC11,458,Australia noted that the CMS process was an important aspect of the work of the Commission and encouraged members to retain the integrity of the CMS process. 69
WCPFC11,459,The Chair observed that there was no consensus on this proposed recommendation from TCC10. Adoption of Final CMR covering 2013 activities
WCPFC11,460,"In response to a request for confirmation that the status for CCMs who cannot attend the SWG stays non-compliant, even though they have submitted more information, TCC Vice-Chair noted that as agreed at TCC10, and as had been mentioned in the executive summary, the SWG did not review the statuses for CCMs which did not attend the SWG meeting. The statuses of CCMs that were not in attendance did not change."
WCPFC11,461,The concerned CCM explained that its delegation has a limited number of English speakers. The proceedings move fast and the language barrier appears to be disregarded.
WCPFC11,462,"One CCM observed that the first discussion of this issue was being made across the floor. This CCM noted that if there was a concern, there were opportunities for it to be raised, and the SWG could have addressed it at the time."
WCPFC11,463,"One CCM noted that its delegation, too, has very few people who speak English. This CCM concentrated on the tropical tuna SWG and no member of its delegation could go to the SWG on compliance. While it tried to get the information subsequently, no one had informed them of the result. This CCM noted that it may still be assessed non-compliant."
WCPFC11,464,"Speaking as FFC Chair, Tokelau noted that the majority of FFA members are non-English speaking and they often find it hard to manage the Commission business. These members consider the language barrier and the small size of their delegations a disproportionate burden, but considered it was unfair to open up the TCC recommendations on these grounds."
WCPFC11,465,"The Chair asked CCMs to ensure they are communicating with each other well before TCC, to make sure concerns are known so the Commission can address them."
WCPFC11,466,"Noting that the draft recommendations in section B of WCPFC11-2014-31 were not agreed, WCPFC11 directed the TCC Vice-Chair and Secretariat to update the Final Compliance Monitoring Report, including the matrix and table of compliance statuses to reflect that CMM 2012-01 paragraph 10; CMM 2012-01 paragraph 30 and Scientific Data to be Provided paragraph 3 were “not assessed” in this year’s CMR."
WCPFC11,467,"WCPFC11 agreed to adopt the Final Compliance Monitoring Report for 2013 comprised of an Executive Summary, a matrix and a table of compliance statuses (Attachment H)."
WCPFC11,468,WCPFC11 agreed to ask TCC to address some CCM’s concerns regarding the CMS process.  9.1.2 Adoption of the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2015
WCPFC11,469,TCC10 recommended to the Commission that the existing WCPFC IUU Vessel List remain unchanged (para 18). 70
WCPFC11,470,"FFA members supported TCC10’s recommendation, noting that these vessels have been listed for 4-5 years and requesting that all CCMs cooperate so WCPFC can follow their activities and track any name, flag or ownership changes. For vessels not flagged to a CCM, FFA members requested CCMs use diplomatic channels to seek updates and action from the flag States of listed vessels. These CCMs requested that when the WCPFC Secretariat advises other organizations of the WCPFC IUU Vessel List, it seeks their cooperation to stay alert for the listed vessels through registration processes and networks."
WCPFC11,471,WCPFC11 adopted an unchanged WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2015. (Attachment I) 9.1.3 Recommendations and advice  Data provision and gaps
WCPFC11,472,"Dr John Hampton (SPC-OFP) presented WCPFC11-2014-19b, in which a proposed tiered scoring system for evaluating compliance with the provision of scientific data to the Commission was outlined. TCC10 had requested SPC develop such a system, to reflect the magnitude of implications of data gaps and report back to WCPFC11 (para 256). There are two aspects of data provision that should be considered: (i) the completeness of the data fields provided; and (ii) the level of coverage achieved by the data provision. Minimum standards for both data fields and coverage are specified in Scientific Data to be provided to the Commission and the WCPFC Regional Observer Programme Minimum Data Standards. There are three categories of compliance that are commonly observed for provision of scientific data: (i) that the data are not provided at all; (ii) that data are provided but are incomplete either because not all data fields have been provided or that minimum coverage levels have not been met; and (iii) that complete data have been provided at or above the minimum level of coverage. For category (ii), it was recommended that a compliance score be computed based on a multiplication of the percentage of the data fields provided and the percentage of the minimum coverage level achieved. It was not felt appropriate to give greater importance to some data fields over others – they are all required and important, and it was recommended that they be treated equally in the compliance scoring system."
WCPFC11,473,Several CCMs thanked SPC for developing the scoring system and expressed support for the recommendations in the paper.
WCPFC11,474,"Japan expressed general support for the idea of a scoring system noting that there are many data gaps to be addressed. On the other hand, Japan stated that the proposed application of this scoring system should be applied to compliance issues. In this point, Japan reminded the Commission that Section 3 of the Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission stipulates that if there are domestic legal constraints, aggregated data shall be provided until such constraints are overcome, and thus CCMs should be regarded as being in full compliance on the requirement if required aggregated data was provided."
WCPFC11,475,"The Chair suggested that before the requirements to which this will apply are determined, the Commission needed to work through the FFA-proposed CMM on provision of catch and effort data and confirmed that the system as described in the paper would only apply to the data fields that are required to be provided to the Commission. 71"
WCPFC11,476,"EU suggested the Commission tries and integrates it into the revised CMS, and noted that new ideas on how to further refine the scoring system may be presented in the future and should be able to be taken into account. The EU considered the system a work in progress."
WCPFC11,477,Other CCMs stated a preference that the proposal should be run through SC11 before TCC11.
WCPFC11,478,"WCPFC11 adopted the tier scoring system for evaluating compliance with the provision of scientific data to the Commission, on the understanding that TCC will keep looking at the process of refining the CMR. The tiered scoring system would be sent to the SC for its consideration. (Attachment J) VMS"
WCPFC11,479,WCPFC11 accepted the recommendation from TCC10 (para 102) and extended the VMS manual position reporting requirements (the WCPFC9 agreed amendments to the VMS SSPs Section 5) until 1 March 2017. (Attachment K) ROP
WCPFC11,480,"The TCC Chair referred the Commission to WCPFC11-2014-IP03, particularly the tables at the front of the paper, and noted that there were a number of TCC recommendations under this agenda item.   IMO number as minimum data standard observer is to collect:"
WCPFC11,481,WCPFC11 agreed that the data field International Maritime Organisation (IMO) number or Lloyd’s Register number required as per CMM 2013-04 is added to the list of minimum standard data fields an observer is asked to collect from vessels that are more than 100 GT or GRT (para 114). Guidelines for ROP Identification Cards:
WCPFC11,482,WCPFC11 adopted as guidelines the following list of information for ROP Identification Cards (para 119):  Suggested minimum required information on the front of each card: 1) Name of the observer 2) Name of the observer provider 3) Nationality of the observer 4) Unique identifying number for the observer 5) Passport style photo of the observer Information that could be placed on either the front or back of the card: 6) Issue date and Expiry date  7) WCPFC logo to indicate observer is ROP observer 8) Logo of Programme and or Country Flag Optional information that could be included on the back of the card: 9) Signature of Observer; 10) Status of observer Qualifications.     72  Measuring and Monitoring ROP longline coverage:
WCPFC11,483,"WCPFC11 approved the guidelines for ROP longline coverage by fleet/fishery described in Attachment L Table 1, noting that it should be open to review and adjustments at future TCC meetings."
WCPFC11,484,"WCPFC11 agreed that CCMs shall: a. Decide on the observer coverage metric and then compile the observer coverage using this metric for their fleet activity in 2013 (as required in Attachment L Tables 2 and 3) and submit this information to the WCPFC Secretariat before 28 February 2015. A sample report format is provided as guidance to assist CCMs with reporting (Attachment L Table 4) b. (for subsequent years) Compile and include this information in their respective Annual Report Part 1 to be submitted from 2015 onwards, noting that revisions can be provided at the annual TCC meeting."
WCPFC11,485,"WCPFC11 tasked the WCPFC Science/Data service provider with compiling estimates of total activity of each fleet for the nominated metric (outlined by the SC10 ISG7) to be included in the template (Attachment L Table 3)  a. For 2013 activities, this information should be combined in the template (Attachment L Table 3) with the observer coverage provided by the CCMs (deadline 28th February 2015) and made available by 30th March 2015. b. For subsequent years, this information should be combined in the template (Attachment L Table 3) with the observer coverage provided by the CCMs (in their Part 1 reports) and made available for SC and TCC"
WCPFC11,486,WCPFC11 tasked the WCPFC Secretariat (with assistance from the Science/Data service provider) with compiling the information reported by CCMs on longline observer coverage and reporting the information included in Attachment L Tables 2 and 3 in papers tabled for future SC and TCC meetings. Guideline timeframes to submit ROP data for high seas transshipment monitoring:
WCPFC11,487,"WCPFC11 agreed that ROP providers which place observers on fish carrier vessels that transship on the high seas are strongly encouraged to send the completed data forms, workbooks, reports and journals of the observer to the Commission Secretariat where possible within 120 days of the disembarkation of the observer from the carrier (para 156). CMM Booklet (ROP specific) to be prepared by Secretariat:"
WCPFC11,488,"WCPFC11 agreed to task the Secretariat to produce a ROP observer-specific CMM booklet commencing in 2015, to be updated on a yearly basis. Based on requests from ROP authorized observer programmes, the Secretariat should arrange for the printing and distribution of the ROP focused Observer CMM booklet. An electronic version of the observer-specific CMM booklet and a booklet containing a complete set of current CMMs should also be made available on the WCPFC public website for download (para 164).  73  Matters to be forwarded to IWG-ROP:"
WCPFC11,489,"WCPFC11 agreed that the following matters identified by TCC10 should be forwarded to the IWG-ROP:  i. Discuss the suggested mechanisms to Prevent and Deter Alcohol-Related Misconduct of Observers (para 149) (Attachment M). ii. Further discuss and provide direction on the following proposed transshipment notification rules for all fish carriers (para 157):   a) 24 hrs prior to entry of the vessel into the WCPFC Convention area must inform the Commission Secretariat on their intentions to either tranship at sea, tranship in a designated port, or tranship both in port and on the high seas; b) 24 hrs prior to departing a port in the WCPFC Convention area must inform the Commission Secretariat on their intentions to tranship at sea or tranship in a designated port or tranship both in port and on the high seas;  c) on completion of their transhipping activities at sea or in port in the WCPFC Convention Area must inform the WCPFC Secretariat within 24hrs of their destination port; and d) intending to tranship at sea on entry into the Convention area, or departing from a port in the Convention area, will notify to the Commission Secretariat the name of the ROP certified observer onboard. Note that the above proposed transshipment notification reporting to the Commission Secretariat is not intended to negate any current zone or port entry or exit procedures.   iii. Discuss and provide guidance to WCPFC12 on the definition of the responsibilities of the flag states in respect of obligation CMM 2007-01 Attachment K Annex C paragraph 4 (para 64(ii)). iv. The matter of interpretation of CMM 2007-01 paragraph 9 to the IWG-ROP (para 64(vi))."
WCPFC11,490,"TCC10 had recommended that the IWG-ROP should “encourage discussion to develop processes to facilitate the provision of data, including observer reports, from the observer providers and placement information from Flag States to the Commission (para 64(i)).”"
WCPFC11,491,"In relation to this TCC10 recommendation, FFA members noted that they have submitted a proposal to deal with the provision of data, including observer reports, from the observer providers and placement information from Flag States to the Commission in a definitive manner and referred delegates to WCPFC11-2014-DP07."
WCPFC11,492,"The Chair suspended discussion on this TCC10 recommendation pending the results of the consideration of the proposed amendment to CMM 2007-01 under agenda 10.7. The Chair noted in the event that the proposed CMM is not adopted, the TCC10 recommendation (para 64(i)) could also be forwarded to the IWG-ROP for discussion.  74"
WCPFC11,493,"Noting that WCPFC11-2014-DP07 was not agreed, WCPFC11 agreed that the IWG-ROP should also encourage discussion to develop processes to facilitate the provision of data, including observer reports, from the observer providers and placement information from Flag States to the Commission (para 64(i)). Transshipment"
WCPFC11,494,The TCC Chair noted there were no substantive recommendations to WCFPC11 from TCC10 related to transshipment. Two TCC10 recommendations set out in para 190 and 191 were noted.  HSBI
WCPFC11,495,The TCC Chair noted there were no substantive recommendations for WCFPC11 from TCC10 relating to the HSBI scheme. One TCC10 recommendation set out in para 200 was noted.
WCPFC11,496,"Japan made a general comment about HSBI Firstly, Japan reported that there have been some cases where boarding and inspection activities were conducted without notification although paragraph 20(d) of CMM 2006-08 calls for the inspecting side to give prior notification to flag States. Secondly, Japan explained that in some cases its vessels have been repored with no active VMS and its investigation identified that the cause was non-provision of VTAF information to the VMS providers by the Secretariat. Japan requested the Secretariat to ensure this information will be provided to the VMS provider."
WCPFC11,497,"The Interim-Executive Director responded that the Secretariat has recognised the issue and explained that over the last 12 months the Secretariat has undertaken a significant amount of work to align the VMS database with the RFV, and had a thorough review of the vessel tracking database. The Secretariat will be contacting some CCMs in the coming year to resolve gaps and improvements can be expected in 2015."
WCPFC11,498,The Chair expressed the hope that the appropriate HSBI notifications are being made and asked CCMs to be mindful of the requirement.
WCPFC11,499,FFA members supported the TCC10 recommendation in paragraph 200 of TCC10 report for the Secretariat continuing to work on mechanisms to ensure updated contact details for authorities of fishing vessels as well as authorities of inspection vessels. RFV
WCPFC11,500,"WCPFC11 accepted the TCC10 recommendation (para 217), and agreed that information reported by flag CCMs as part of Record of Fishing Vessels updates, related to charter notifications and high seas transshipment authorizations should be treated as public domain data. EHSP"
WCPFC11,501,"WCPFC11 accepted the TCC10 recommendations (paras 228 and 234), and agreed: i) to the development of clearer and consistent specifications to address the issues relating to the reporting of data in this and similar CMMs;  75  ii) to task the Secretariat to work with interested CCMs on some joint initiatives that CCMs might use on a voluntary basis, with a view to streamlining the WCPFC data entry processes for EHSP-SMA reporting; and  iii) to amend CMM 2010-02 paragraph 2 to add vessel name to reporting requirements.1  Swordfish"
WCPFC11,502,TCC10 recommended to WCPFC11 that the Secretariat be tasked to complete two outstanding tasks in the TCC9 recommendations and to present additional information to SC11. (para 303).
WCPFC11,503,"The EU asked to revisit wording relating to the words “identify mitigation measures to help address and avoid overfishing”, opining that this implied overfishing in the western Pacific is occurring, when SC has confirmed that overfishing is not occurring. The EU noted that overfishing might be happening in the eastern Pacific Ocean but not in the WCPO, where the stock is healthy."
WCPFC11,504,"Japan asked SPC for its scientific view on whether swordfish in the Pacific Ocean is a single stock, and expressed concern that the EU’s intervention might weaken the recommendation if it was a single stock, which would not be good for the Commission."
WCPFC11,505,"Dr Harley (SPC-OFP) noted that the SC could not come to a conclusion on the status of the swordfish stock but provided a recommendation related to fishing mortality (that there should be no increase). In response to a question, SPC also clarified there is one stock which covers the eastern Pacific Ocean and another in the western and central area; there is mixing in the central area. The current understanding is that there are three stocks in the Pacific."
WCPFC11,506,"The Chair stated that the amended wording did not weaken the measure but clarifies that there is no overfishing occurring and the hope to avoid it in the future. The EU confirmed that the suggested wording was not intended to weaken the recommendation language; “may it occur” was preferred for the sake of preciseness.                                                         1 Secretariat note: At WCPFC11 the Commission did not specify the exact amendment that should be made to the EHSP entry and exit report format as prescribed in paragraph 2 of CMM 2010-02.  In the absence of clear direction from the Commission, and in response to two comments received on the draft WCPFC11 summary report, the Secretariat provides the following guidance to CCMs to consider in their implementation of the WCPFC11 decision:    Flag CCMs should instruct their vessels to include the “Vessel name” (exactly as it is written in the Record of Fishing Vessels), at the end of specified reporting format prescribed in paragraph 2 of CMM 2010-02:   VID/Entry/Exit: Date/Time1; Lat/Long1; YFT/BET/ALB/SKJ/SWO/SHK/OTH/TOT(kgs) /TRANSHIPMENT (Y/N) /VESSEL NAME2   1 Of anticipated point of entry or exit. 2 Exactly as it written in the Record of Fishing Vessels. 76"
WCPFC11,507,"WCPFC11 tasked the Secretariat to complete two outstanding tasks in the TCC9 recommendations and to present additional information to SC11. These were: (i) distribution of swordfish catches between EEZs and high seas, to the extent possible, and (ii) identify mitigation measures to help address and avoid overfishing, may it occur.  9.2 E-monitoring and E-reporting initiatives"
WCPFC11,508,"The E-Monitoring and E-Reporting Workshop (EmandErW) was held in Honiara, Solomon Islands, from 31 March-1 April 2014, chaired by Ray Clarke (USA). TCC10 subsequently received the EmandErW Chair’s Report of the workshop, updates from CCMs and a paper from the Secretariat on proposed next steps for the development of draft electronic standards."
WCPFC11,509,"The Interim-Executive Director noted that the Secretariat had prepared for consideration by CCMs a draft TOR for an EmandEr working group (WCPFC11-2014-20). During the meeting a revised TOR was circulated (WCPFC11-2014-20_rev1), which took into account comments received from CCMs during WCPFC11. The proposal to establish an ErandEm working group had come about as a recommendation from TCC and SC that, recognising that a number of CCMs are already using or are soon to commence using E-reporting systems as part of their fisheries monitoring and information management systems, and if the Commission failed to agree on standards for electronic data the Secretariat may be left behind. Agreeing a TOR would be a step in developing the electronic reporting standards which will take into account the current and developing fisheries monitoring and information management systems in use by members, and provide a basis for the Secretariat’s preparations to be ready to receive electronic forms of fisheries data and reporting."
WCPFC11,510,Several CCMs supported the establishment of a working group and the draft TOR.
WCPFC11,511,"Australia nominated Kerry Smith (Australia) to progress the group’s work, which several CCMs supported, noting her excellent work in the previous year."
WCPFC11,512,It was particularly important for the EU that WCPFC does not reinvent the wheel. This CCM noted there is a lot of work going on in other RFMOs and internationally and whatever systems WCPFC considers they need to be able to talk to one another.
WCPFC11,513,"One CCM commented that to reduce trial and error it would be beneficial to seek views from experts, including port coordinators, as they will collect and monitor certain information in major Convention area ports. This could be closely related to E-reporting. This CCM proposed the insertion of ‘port coordinators’ in para 5."
WCPFC11,514,"Japan queried whether port coordinators should be added to para 5 as the port coordinator proposal was still under discussion, and asked to keep it blank until the proposal is adopted. The Chair noted that port coordinators were already in place in the region and the Commission should take advantage of their expertise, to which Japan agreed."
WCPFC11,515,"WCPFC11 agreed to form an ErandEm working group, with terms of reference set out in Attachment N. WCPFC11 elected Kerry Smith (Australia) to be Chair of the ErandEm working group. 77"
WCPFC11,516,"The Interim-Executive Director noted that Kerry Smith was very well suited to progressing this important piece of work. The Secretariat noted that there is a budgetary implication to the proposal, and that there was currently a line item in the draft budget for the work. 9.3 CDS-IWG Report"
WCPFC11,517,"WCPFC9 established the Catch Documentation Scheme Intersessional Working Group (CDS-IWG), and appointed Mr Alois Kinol (PNG) as Chair. A Workplan for the CDS-IWG was approved at WCPFC10. The CDS-IWG met on 24 September 2014 and the CDS-IWG Chair reported to TCC10 (WCPFC11-2014-IP05). TCC10 endorsed the CDS-IWG Workplan for 2015 and recommended it to the Commission (para 280)."
WCPFC11,518,"FFA members thanked the IWG Chair for the IWG meeting reports and noted the range of views held by CCMs, which meant high level discussions took place but not the detail of a CDS framework. Despite this, these CCMs took the view that the discussions at the second IWG meeting moved the Commission further than any previous attempt. FFA members have commenced preparations for the next IWG meeting and referred CCMs to the FFA paper submitted prior to the second IWG meeting (WCPFC-2014-CDSIWG-DP01). These CCMs supported the proposed Workplan and expressed the view that this process would deliver a framework for the development of specific systems which could meet the national and sub-regional requirements of CCMs and the regional objectives of a CDS."
WCPFC11,519,"The Interim-Executive Director noted that this recommendation has budgetary implications, and the Secretariat included the costs of a CDS-IWG workshop in the budget proposal for 2015 that is being considered by FAC."
WCPFC11,520,"WCPFC11 accepted this recommendation of TCC10, and approved the CDS-IWG Workplan for 2015. (Attachment O)  9.4 Port Coordinators Proposal"
WCPFC11,521,"A joint discussion paper between FSM-NORMA/WCPFC was circulated to CCMs (Circular 2014/36) and discussed at TCC10. TCC10 requested that the Secretariat and FSM further develop the paper, taking into account the discussion at TCC10, and bring a draft proposal with TOR to WCPFC11 for further consideration."
WCPFC11,522,"The Interim-Executive Director referred delegates to a revised joint proposal between the Secretariat and FSM-NORMA which was revised following discussions at TCC10 (WCPFC11-2014-WP21). In response to a request from some CCMs during TCC10, a table has been included on the front page of the proposal which contains available information about the volume of transshipment activities that occurs in the five ports which are proposed for funding; this is based on information available in Annual Reports Part 1 and which were confirmed by the relevant CCMs. The proposal is for a port coordinator to be funded by the Commission in five fisheries administrations: FSM, Kiribati, RMI, Solomon Islands and PNG. It is proposed that each administration could claim up to USD15,000 over 2 years and a one-off overhead and equipment costs of up to USD5000. The proposal takes into account concerns raised by a number of CCMs during TCC10 including that ports are areas of sovereignty, and that it was important to allow flexibility in how individual agencies take into account their existing staff and needs. The paper provides a broad list of potential duties for each Port Coordinator and Heads of fisheries agencies are provided flexibility to direct those duties to areas of greatest need. While 78  funding would come from the Commission, the port coordinator positions, as national staff, would be accountable within the usual lines of reporting within their national fisheries agency."
WCPFC11,523,"FSM noted that SPC was included in the consultation process to ensure it was as comprehensive as possible, and explained that some CCMs have been undertaking data collection in their ports and making information on transshipments available to SPC. WCPFC and SPC have advised that the entirety of this information is not always useful. FSM explained that the proposal addresses maintaining activities in ports and expanding to meet the needs of WCPFC, and while these CCMs can collect and make the information available, but it has to be paid for. FSM explained that some have had to scale back port monitoring activities as they were not funded. FSM noted that a 2 year trial is proposed."
WCPFC11,524,The Chair noted that this is a start and the Commission can keep improving the programme.
WCPFC11,525,One CCM asked what the linkage is with the FFA port State measures proposal in WCPFC11-2014-DP04 and whether the data that was collected by port coordinators under the programme would be provided to the Commission.
WCPFC11,526,"The Interim-Executive Director responded to confirm that the proposal is for the port coordinators to be national staff of the relevant Fisheries Agency or Department. The proposal recognizes that a number of Pacific island countries already submit data collected from port monitoring activities to SPC, and this data underpins scientific work for the Commission; the proposal is intended to provide assistance to Pacific Island countries by supporting fisheries data collection procedures that they currently undertake in their ports."
WCPFC11,527,"FSM confirmed there is no current linkage between this proposal and the port State measures proposal – port coordinators are the starting point for capacity building activities, with the Commission playing a role to support SIDS. There are a significant number of transshipments. National agencies would collect the data and get it to SPC and make it available to WCPFC through the data rules."
WCPFC11,528,"Many CCMs supported the proposal, with one asking that the discussion be deferred until the port State measures CMM was discussed. Several CCMs supported the trial period."
WCPFC11,529,"FFA members explained that the Commission needs to meaningfully address the capacity needs of SIDS and support this approach. During discussions in subsidiary meetings, the assistance of coastal states is often requested to monitor foreign fleets, in particular transhipment and unloading activities. However, resourcing is not forthcoming. FFA members supported a 2 year trial period."
WCPFC11,530,"While supporting the measure, the EU attention to the issue of data exchange with SPC and coordination between observer programs. This CCM saw the proposal as distinct from port State measures, with different objectives, noting it would improve understanding about transshipments in ports."
WCPFC11,531,"Japan generally supported the concept of WCPFC Port Coordinator considering the importance of monitoring and data collection of transshipment activities as the Commission activities, noting that capacity building in these areas are the main objective of the Japan Trust Fund. Considering the positions character was as Commission 79  coordinators, Japan proposed that its duties should be decided by the Commission in consultation with relevant port States. Japan also proposed that the information collected should be shared with all Commission members and requested SPC, as a scientific provider, to prepare a progress report each year for SC and TCC. As for the future after the 2 year trial, Japan stated that priority should be placed on possible expansion of monitoring ports considering the WCPFC’s limited budget and its maximum utilisation."
WCPFC11,532,"One CCM supported the proposal as it seeks to address the capacity needs of SIDS, but requested that non-SIDS CCMs consider funding for this work, to avoid adding costs when SIDS are trying to address capacity issues. Other CCMs supported deferring discussion of the port State measures proposal until after the port coordinators trial period."
WCPFC11,533,"Some CCMs stated there was not a link between this proposal and the port State measures proposal, or any need to suspend while discussion on the latter is pending. However, one CCM added there were very good elements in the port State measures proposal, especially the Annex which provides comprehensive guidelines about how port inspections might take place. These should be formally adopted by the Commission."
WCPFC11,534,"The Chair noted that the port coordinators project focuses on collecting fisheries data. The port State measures proposal has many more issues associated with it than simply data collection. The Chair reminded CCMs that WCPFC has acknowledged many times the need to get as much accurate data as possible, to help the scientists give the best advice."
WCPFC11,535,"Some CCMs disagreed, commenting that there should be strong linkages between the two proposals. Discussions on this proposal were suspended pending the port State measures discussions."
WCPFC11,536,"On Friday 5 December, the Chair revisited the port coordinator proposal, noting that although discussion had been suspended there was a placeholder in FAC for it. One CCM reiterated its view that the port coordinator proposal has linkages with the port State measures proposal, and as the port State measures proposal had been withdrawn this CCM could not agree with the port coordinator proposal."
WCPFC11,537,"The Chair noted that FFA had not withdrawn the proposal, and stressed that port coordinators would collect fisheries data, not compliance or other kinds of data."
WCPFC11,538,"FSM confirmed that the port State measures proposal was not withdrawn by FFA, it simply was not adopted and reiterated that the port coordinator proposal is about data collection. FSM commented that SIDS continue to carry the burden of providing data, and considered the proposal would go a long way to assisting SIDS not only in meeting their obligations but in facilitating the flow of data for stock assessments. These SIDS want to continue these activities but there were costs to them, as well as group benefits. FSM saw no linkage between data collection by the port coordinators and port State measures."
WCPFC11,539,One CCM noted that it had listened carefully and could now support the proposal.
WCPFC11,540,The EU stated that it did not see the linkage with port State measures. This proposal was not about performing inspections; port coordinators would improve data collection. This CCM regretted that the Commission could not reach agreement on this proposal just because one delegation believes there is a linkage. 80
WCPFC11,541,"Japan took the view that the proposal was a comprehensive and appropriate scheme, considering the importance of monitoring and data collection of transshipment activities, and agreed with the concept that the Commission should work closely in consultation with coastal states. Japan stated their view that SPC should provide progress reports of activities to SC and TCC in order to facilitate information sharing of the activities among all CCMs."
WCPFC11,542,"WCPFC11 agreed: a. To establish a trial WCPFC port coordinators programme based on the proposed terms of reference (Attachment P). The programme will be implemented on a trial basis for two (2) years in 5 ports in the WCPO. The positions would be funded from the WCPFC Annual Budget during 2015 and 2016 (based on local salary rates), but the positions would operate as an integral part of the National Fisheries Agency/Department with reporting through the appropriate line manager in the National Fisheries Agency/Department.  b. That the five ports which would be eligible to receive funding would be Pohnpei, (FSM), Majuro (RMI); Tarawa or Christmas Island (Kiribati); Rabual (PNG) and Honiara in the Solomon Islands (SI). Each WCPFC Member would be able to submit an invoice to WCPFC Secretariat for payment towards their Port Coordinator, which is up to USD15,000 per year over a two year period plus $5,000 one off equipment and establishment cost.  c. Relevant Members, SPC-OFP and WCPFC Secretariat will jointly report to SC and TCC (in 2015 and 2016), on the implementation of the trial WCPFC port coordinators programme.  d. If after two years the evaluation proves that the program has been successful the Commission can then take an informed decision to extend the program to other ports in the WCPO, where appropriate. 9.5 Proposal to refine CMM 2013-03 – RFV SSPs Proposal (Secretariat)"
WCPFC11,543,"The Interim-Executive Director briefly introduced WCPFC11-2014-22 and WCPFC11-2014-22_supplA, noting that WCPFC11-2014-22 Attachment 1 is a proposal to revise the CMM 2013-03 on Standards, Specifications and Procedures for the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (the RFV SSPs CMM). The Secretariat had provided some suggestions for changes in a proposal to TCC10 based on a 4-5 month review of implementation challenges CCMs had faced when submitting excel spreadsheet-based data for RFV updates. Some key points of the current proposal, which takes on board comments from TCC10 include:  updating references to current CMMs;  providing a mechanism for CCMs to submit an IMO or LR number for their vessels where it is available. Currently only countries using the online system are able to submit these numbers, the proposed amendment will ensure that those CCMs submitting updates via an excel document can also add an IMO or LR number, where available;  clarifying the use of data action codes;  edits to the ‘vessel type’ list;  using abbreviations or codes for long phrases to reduce errors in submissions of RFV updates from CCMs, particularly in submissions via an excel document; 81   a process for using abbreviations in place of full text names for vessels Port of Registry. The proposal is for the Secretariat to maintain a living list of port codes; any time a CCM wants to include a new port code this can be added to the list within 2 days;   in response to a concern raised at TCC10, a 6 month delay in implementation is proposed, with the amended RFV SSPs applying from June 2015."
WCPFC11,544,Japan confirmed its support for the proposal on the condition that there is a 6 month delay for implementation following the adoption of the amendments. Japan expressed thanks to the Secretariat for taking their concern into account in the revised proposal.
WCPFC11,545,The Interim-Executive Director noted two matters the Secretariat had not been able to take up in this proposal and referred delegates to page 3 of WCPFC11-2014-22: a) One CCM had requested a two letter country code change; and b) there was a proposal to include a deadline for CCMs to provide minimum data fields for all vessels that were on the RFV prior to June 2014.
WCPFC11,546,"Several CCMs supported the proposal (WCPFC11-2014-22 Attachment 1), with some thanking the Secretariat for reflecting their comments during the development process."
WCPFC11,547,"FFA members commented that the amendments will further improve the quality of vessel records in the WCPFC RFV database. These CCMs continued to support the compulsory inclusion of the IMO number, which had been part of the original proposal, and offered to work with other CCMs to finalise the remaining data requirements."
WCPFC11,548,"In reference to one of the two matters noted to not have been taken up in the proposal, a CCM supported the Commission making sure all CCMs have completed the minimum fields for their vessels on the RFV. They acknowledged that this may be a compliance issue that can be taken up through future reviews of implementation of the RFV SSPs. Having a fully accurate RFV is an important issue for this CCM."
WCPFC11,549,"In response to queries from CCMs, the Interim-Executive Director confirmed that:  the proposed modifications in the RFV SSPs related to the IMO number were to duly reflect CMM 2013-04 in the RFV SSPs.   If CCMs prefer, that the IMO number could be displayed on the public website version of the RFV more prominently. The placement of the IMO number towards the end of the RFV SSPs specifications for excel documents is for technical/database reasons.  The proposed abbreviations are mostly based on international codes, existing codes have been used where they are available, but where they are not available the approach has been a little more arbitrary."
WCPFC11,550,WCPFC11 agreed to the proposed changes contained in Attachment 1 to WCPFC11-2014-22 and agreed to adopt CMM 2014-03: Conservation and Management Measure for Record of Fishing Vessels Standards Specifications and Procedures (RFV-SSPs). (Attachment Q). 9.6 Responses to Non-Compliance – IWG Report
WCPFC11,551,"WCPFC10 established an IWG to develop responses to non-compliance (CMM 2013-02, para 24). Advising that there was no paper available for the meeting, the IWG-Responses 82  to Non-Compliance Chair, Alexa Cole (USA), noted that it became clear from discussions at TCC10 that CCMs were thinking about responses to non-compliance and were working towards building that into the existing process as the draft revised CMS CMM. The IWG Chair noted that Annex 1 was significantly revised to more clearly outline steps for corrective action. Language in Annex 1 would allow for sanctions and if that language is adopted as part of the new CMS CMM, over the next year this would provide the IWG with a basis to put together a process for applying sanctions and ensuring that the relevant CCM had sufficient opportunity to respond before corrective actions might be applied."
WCPFC11,552,Japan commented that in the discussion over responses to non-compliance the Commission should take prioritization of non-compliance and consistency with Article 25 of the Convention into consideration.
WCPFC11,553,The IWG-Responses to Non-Compliance Chair agreed that both are considerations that should be part of the process as any possible sanctions for non-compliance are developed. 9.7 TCC Workplan 2015
WCPFC11,554,TCC10 recommended that the Commission maintain the existing 2015 TCC Work Plan and the Secretariat’s normal practice of preparing draft budget for 2015 and indicative budgets for 2016-2017 will continue (para 398).
WCPFC11,555,"The Interim-Executive Director noted that the 2015 TCC Workplan (WCPFC11-2014-FAC8-14) and priorities had been discussed during the FAC meeting, and some CCMs had signalled a preference to discuss it further."
WCPFC11,556,WCPFC11 accepted the Summary Report of the Tenth Regular Annual Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee.  AGENDA  ITEM  10  -  CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURE PROPOSALS
WCPFC11,557,"In addition to proposals to refine the tropical tuna measure CMM 2013-01 for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna in the WCPO (which were considered under Agenda item 6), a number of proposals for new CMMs or to refine existing CMMs were considered by the Commission. 10.1 Proposal to refine CMM 2012-07 – Seabirds (USA)"
WCPFC11,558,"USA introduced proposed revisions to CMM 2012-07 to mitigate impacts of fishing for highly migratory fish stocks on seabirds (WCPFC11-2014-DP01), noting that since the current CMM has been in place, vessels less than 24 metres in length have been exempt from employing seabird mitigation methods when fishing in the Convention Area north of 23°N. The Commission was supposed to consider the exemption last year and, this year, the SC and TCC have not provided evaluations. The USA's proposed revisions to the measure phases out the exemption, to be removed by 1 January 2017. The proposal includes a process for a CCM to nominate appropriate alternative mitigation measures, including identifying alternative minimum technical specifications for small longline vessels or areas within which seabird mitigation is not needed by small longline vessels 83  because of an absence of seabirds, and for the Commission to act on CCMs' requests based on the recommendations of the SC and TCC."
WCPFC11,559,"Japan stated that it could not support the proposal at this meeting, noting that it is continuing to research seabird mitigation measures for small scale fishing vessels in the North Pacific. Japan reminded the Commission it has reported that a) a single tori line pole with unweighted branch lines is effective in the Northern hemisphere; and b) the current specification of the tori line in CMM 2012-07 is not appropriate for small vessels in the North Pacific ocean."
WCPFC11,560,"Several CCMs supported the proposal, with FFA members noting there is no evidence to suggest any difference in seabird interaction rates between smaller vessels and larger ones. These CCMs viewed the proposal as a responsible way to reduce the impact of the tuna fishery on birds. The proposal allowed flag States and vessel operators time to investigate which mitigation measures work best for them and to learn how to use them. These CCMs supported a phased-in approach applying mitigation measures to any new fleet."
WCPFC11,561,The Chair noted that the USA should keep working on the proposal.
WCPFC11,562,"After consultations during WCPFC11, USA advised on 5 December that there had been no progress on the seabird proposal. This CCM requested that the Commission close discussion on the measure, but keep working intersessionally on this important issue. 10.2 Proposal to refine CMM 2011-02 – Commission VMS (USA)"
WCPFC11,563,"USA described its proposal (WCPFC11-2014-DP02) to revise CMM 2011-02 for the Commission VMS as housekeeping for the Commission, to reflect WCPFC9’s endorsement of the NC8 commitment to implement VMS in the northwest quadrant of the Convention Area."
WCPFC11,564,"After consultations during WCPFC11, a revised version of the proposal was circulated (WCPFC11-2014-DP02_rev1). The USA noted that the only change being proposed (aside from the removal of duplicated para 8) was to add a footnote against para 3 (“3. With respect to the area north of 20°N and west of 175°E, the system will be activated at a date to be determined by the Commission1”) which reads: “Activated on 31 December 2013.”"
WCPFC11,565,"WCPFC11 agreed to adopt CMM 2014-02 Conservation and Management Measure for Commission VMS, which replaces CMM 2011-02. (Attachment R)  10.3 Proposals to refine CMM 2010-07 – Sharks"
WCPFC11,566,"FFA members introduced (WCPFC11-2014-DP03_rev1), advising that they are working towards more comprehensive measures for sharks taken in their waters, through increasingly stringent Harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions for access and through National Plans of Action. These CCMs noted that for these measures to be fully effective they need to be complemented by compatible measures on the high seas. FFA members have proposed comprehensive shark measures at previous Commission meetings and have taken comments by other CCMs into account in the proposal submitted to WCPFC11. This proposal has more flexibility than previous versions, including:  CCMs can choose between two main mitigation measures: banning the use of wire traces by their vessels or banning the use of shark lines and using circle hooks with increased observer coverage.  84   All vessels to land sharks with all fins, including the tail fin, attached to the shark, but some domestic vessels fishing in their EEZ which are subject to additional, stringent MCS regimes can continue to land sharks with fins removed."
WCPFC11,567,"EU noted its own proposal (WCPFC11-2014-DP17) provided for fins naturally attached, and considered the FFA and EU measures could be combined; the delegation would work with FFA. The EU observed that there were some weaknesses in the FFA proposal, including exceptions to fins naturally attached. The EU saw its approach as more ambitious in this respect, and noted that the fin to carcass ratio is impossible to monitor and ineffective. The EU didn’t want to run the risk of this methodology continuing, and called for more dialogue, if not an SWG to look at the shark measure."
WCPFC11,568,"FFA members noted that they are fishing nations as well, and longlining is an important part of the economies of many of their members, perhaps more important, proportionally, than most non-SIDS CCMs present. The proposed measure does not intend to cripple fisheries but to secure a long-term viable future. These CCMs noted that Commission members have witnessed the growing trend towards trade restrictions and species retention bans, both of which reduce the profitability of longliners but do not change their behaviour. Since these measures do not contribute to reducing shark mortality, growth in such measures continues."
WCPFC11,569,"On 4 December, Palau reported that FFA CCMs has consulted on the draft sharks CMM and concerns centred around the finning provisions. A revised version of the proposal had been posted for consideration."
WCPFC11,570,"Based on further consultations, Palau on behalf of FFA CCMs tabled a revised measure (WCPFC11-2014-DP03_rev3) and reported that the proposal had progressed significantly. The rev2 document did not receive full support from some CCMs, however agreement was reached, in rev3, on a measure that limited the mitigation measures to just a) and b) of the original proposed list:  1. CCMs shall ensure that their vessels comply with at least one of the following options: a. do not use or carry wire trace as branch lines or leaders; or b. do not use branch lines running directly off the longline floats or drop lines, known as shark lines."
WCPFC11,571,"Palau noted that the CMM provides for the Commission to review the implementation and effectiveness of the measure’s management arrangements, including data requirements, after 2 years and consider the application of additional measures for the shark management in the Convention area, as appropriate. The CMM does not replace any other CMM. Palau noted that it is simple in approach but a step in the right direction for these endangered species."
WCPFC11,572,"EU thanked FFA members for their efforts and supported the measure, noting that the proposal was not its preferred option as this CCM favoured fins naturally attached with no exceptions; this CCM recognised that this will have a huge impact particularly on vulnerable species. EU expressed disappointment with countries that continue to oppose significant progress in the protection of shark species and reminded the Commission that there is a lot of work being done at the international level and adopting rev2 would have brought forward significant progress. It was regretful that it had to be watered down to meet the needs of a few delegations. The EU commented that the Commission cannot think it operates in isolation and wondered if the new Executive Director could approach other organizations that are carrying out this kind of work and report back to the Commission.  85"
WCPFC11,573,Some CCMs were able to go along with the proposal if edits were made to paragraph 2. Japan which had proposed to change “avoid catch of highly depleted species” to “release highly depleted release” stated that longline fishers cannot avoid bycatch of those species practically.
WCPFC11,574,Some CCMs commented that the measure did not go far enough.
WCPFC11,575,"One CCM recalled the obligation under the Convention to manage the WCPO fisheries in a way that takes account of ecosystem effects and bycatch. This CCM opined that this was a small step forward, and could not accept the edit proposed, as “avoid catch of” is an important element of the measure."
WCPFC11,576,"The EU remarked that a CCM had said at TCC that its fishers did not catch a single oceanic whitetip shark, and thought this might be an opportune time for CCMs to inform the Commission about techniques to achieve this. The EU saw ‘avoid’ as important, noting that there is already an obligation to release silky and oceanic whitetip sharks."
WCPFC11,577,The Vice-Chair closed discussions on the proposals recognising that agreement had been reached based on amendments to WCPFC11-2014- DP03 rev3 which had been made on screen.
WCPFC11,578,"WCPFC11 agreed to adopt CMM 2014-05: Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks (Attachment S), and noted that this CMM is not intended to replace or prejudice any other Shark CMMs. 10.4 Port State Measures (FFA)"
WCPFC11,579,"FFA members proposed a CMM on port State measures, outlined in WCPFC11-2014-DP04. Revisions had been made to the proposal since its initial consideration at WCPFC10 and further discussion at TCC10, based on input from other CCMs. FFA members emphasized that their proposal was a good starting point on which to build further port State-based MCS activities. The proposal maintains the inspection-request mechanism, removes the vessel of interest component, the requirement to inspect high risk fishing vessels, and includes guidelines for inspection procedures, port inspector training and an inspection report. It addresses the special requirements of SIDS."
WCPFC11,580,"The EU expressed its support for the proposal, noting that it is stronger this year, and incorporates comments provided by delegations."
WCPFC11,581,Some CCMs could not go along with the proposal at this time.
WCPFC11,582,The Chair noted there was no consensus to adopt the measure.
WCPFC11,583,"FFA members expressed their disappointment as in these CCMs’ view the measure is much needed. They stressed that it is not the FAO Port State Measures Agreement, with which some CCMs had confused the proposal. FFA members advised the Commission of their commitment to continuing the development of port State measures, and will consider implementing this proposal through their internal processes. 10.5 Proposal to refine CMM 2010-05 – South Pacific Albacore (FFA)"
WCPFC11,584,"FFA members presented a proposal for a more comprehensive CMM for South Pacific albacore tuna, to replace CMM 2010-05 (WCPFC11-2014-DP05). FFA members’ proposal covers the entire WCPO range of the stock, promotes cooperation with IATTC, and would limit catch rather than effort in part of this area. It defines a total catch limit for the stock, set at the latest assessed MSY level – around 100,000t – an interim limit which would be 86  replaced by a TRP when one is agreed by WCPFC, and proposes that the total stock limit be divided into four different sub-limits. There are no flag limits for EEZs, with zone limits instead, so fishing nations are not limited by their flag state allocations, which only apply on the high seas. Access arrangements are still possible."
WCPFC11,585,"American Samoa acknowledged the presence of US Congresswoman Aumua Amata Coleman. This CCM described how highly dependent on South Pacific albacore it is. Catches in the WCPO have risen dramatically in recent years, while the local fleet has declined. The Pago Pago-based longline fleet which principally fishes around American Samoa is now effectively unviable. This CCM urged the Commission to agree to limit high seas and EEZ catches of this species. American Samoa announced an intention to establish a catch limit in its EEZ and wanted to nominate the American Samoa albacore fishery as a performance indicator for high seas South Pacific albacore."
WCPFC11,586,"On 4 December, FFA members advised that they had met as a group and discussed comments received. Later on 4 December, New Zealand reported that it had received comments on the draft and would soon be in a position to provide a revised version."
WCPFC11,587,"On 5 December, New Zealand noted that South Pacific albacore was one of FFA’s top priorities this year. FFA members have engaged with countries with a strong interest. A range of opinions were offered but few specifics, with the exception of the USA’s written comments."
WCPFC11,588,"USA strongly supported many aspects of the proposed shift in the CMM from effort based to catch based measures, and noted that limiting catches of South Pacific albacore in-zone and on the high seas is a necessary change. The USA would like to see more support for the shift to catch limits, and actual controls of catch limits that are in place."
WCPFC11,589,"Several CCMs supported the proposal, noting general concern with the management of these stocks."
WCPFC11,590,"A few other CCMs could not support the proposal, with concerns including: a) no new stock assessment has been carried out on South Pacific albacore, so it was premature to consider establishing a catch limit; b) if FFA member countries want to establish a catch limit transfer, it should be applied to all the WCPFC stocks, not just South Pacific albacore; c) establishing separate high seas and waters under national jurisdiction catch limits is not suitable for tropical tuna species; d) para 1 of the measure was deleted and that had included catch and effort limits; e) longline fishing effort and capacity should not be transferred to other parts of the Convention area; f) there was no evident justification for changing the 2001-2004 baseline; g) the kind of transfers envisaged among PNA members should be applied to all members."
WCPFC11,591,"Sympathising with FFA members’ concerns on recent expansion in catch of this species, Japan requested that effort limit provided in paragraph 1 of the current measure should be maintained. Japan also stated that CCMs shall not transfer longline fishing effort and capacity to areas within the Convention Area north of the equator in order not to undermine the effectiveness of the measure."
WCPFC11,592,EU had submitted its concerns to FFA and was fairly certain it could support the measure.
WCPFC11,593,One CCM considered that only targeted fishing for South Pacific albacore between 10 and 15˚S should be subject to management and should not apply to CCMs which do not actively fish for South Pacific albacore between 10 and 20˚S. This CCM noted that the tables do not contain exact data as high seas catch is not submitted. 87
WCPFC11,594,"Samoa commented that although the Tokelau Arrangement has only just come into effect, the Harvest Strategy for the South Pacific Albacore Fishery and associated rules have been in place for two years. The high seas are subject only to CMM 2010-05, which simply limits the number of vessels actively fishing for South Pacific albacore south of 20°S above 2005 or 2000-2004 levels, and requires CCMs to report their albacore catch and bycatch south of 20°S. The high seas between the equator and 20°S are subject to no limits."
WCPFC11,595,"One CCM commented that it would be useful to get SPC’s opinion but noted the SC’s consensus that longline fishing mortality and catch of South Pacific albacore should be reduced to avoid further declines and possibly exceeding the LRP, and maintaining economically viable catch rates. These CCMs stated that nothing is gained by waiting for the next stock assessment, except perhaps the need to adopt more stringent limits."
WCPFC11,596,"The Cook Islands commented that coastal states are moving towards zone-based management and seek some high seas compatibility, observing that there is a tremendous amount of albacore being caught in the high seas pocket next to the Cook Islands EEZ. This CCM stated that there is insufficient scientific data to set an Olympic TAC or MSY."
WCPFC11,597,"The Chair suggested sending the proposal back to FFA CCMs to work these issues through. However, New Zealand commented that it may not happen this year."
WCPFC11,598,The Cook Islands suggested re-engaging with CCMs in the margins.
WCPFC11,599,"After more consultations held on the last day of WCPFC11, New Zealand, on behalf of FFA CCMs, reported there was no further progress."
WCPFC11,600,"Niue’s Minister of Natural Resources, Hon. Billy Talagi, expressed disappointment on behalf of FFA and commented that the Commission’s process left him wondering how the region’s fish stocks will be managed sustainably and how Niue can ever develop its fisheries. The Honourable Minister lamented that his country’s fishermen will now see no hope in their waters and the people of Niue are prevented from participating in their own fishery because of those developing their fisheries just outside the waters of Niue. The Honourable Minister observed that it looked as though it will be left to SIDS to take the necessary management action in their area of influence, Pacific Island nations’ EEZs."
WCPFC11,601,The Vice-Chair closed discussion on this proposal. 10.6 Provision of operational level catch and effort data (FFA)
WCPFC11,602,"RMI presented the FFA proposal for a CMM on operational data (WCPFC11-2014-DP06), which requires operational data to be provided in accordance with the standards set out in the data rules, revises the data rules to remove the reference to domestic legal constraints, noting that the exemption was provided to CCMs some ten years ago, and requires the Commission to take into account provision of data in any allocation as set out in Article 10 of the Convention. FFA expects that the CMM will also provide a basis for the Executive Director to implement the existing requirement that a CCM’s access to non-public domain WCPFC data is removed for CCMs that fail to comply with WCPFC data provision rules. It was noted that SIDS are providing operational level catch and effort data, even those with the smallest administrations."
WCPFC11,603,The Chair noted that an agreement would be welcome so the Commission can begin to get all the information it should be getting to assist science and management in the WCPO.
WCPFC11,604,Indonesia stated that it had some concerns and was directed by the Chair to make RMI aware of those concerns. 88
WCPFC11,605,Some CCMs expressed support for the measure.
WCPFC11,606,"One CCM asked whether the proposal clarifies that if a country has provided aggregated data it still has an obligation to provide operational data. RMI responded that the proposal aims for the provision of operational level data, with the provision of aggregated data not sufficient."
WCPFC11,607,"During WCPFC11, FFA members and the six Asian countries worked together on an agreement relating to operational data, which was considered in the amendments that were agreed to CMM 2013-01 Conservation and Management Measure on Bigeye, Yellowfin and Skipjack in the WCPO. See Agenda item 6.2.1."
WCPFC11,608,There was otherwise no further discussion on the proposed CMM on operational data (WCPFC11-2014-DP06). 10.7 Proposal to refine CMM 2007-01 – Regional Observer Programme (FFA)
WCPFC11,609,"FFA members introduced a proposal (WCPFC11-2014-DP07) for amendments to the CMM for the Regional Observer Programme (CMM 2007-01) and asked that the Commission agree to its recommendation to remove the provision that would see observer reports provided to vessel masters, for the following reasons: a. it directly compromises the safety and impartiality of the observer; b. it has created confusion amongst flag States on how they can gain access to ROP data; c. it is contrary to the Commission’s rules and procedures for the protection, access to, and dissemination of data; and d. it is impractical."
WCPFC11,610,FFA members stated that observer safety concerns override the reasons for the paragraph’s inclusion in the CMM; concerns that are based on observers’ compliance role and documented cases of intimidation. These CCMs feel that this issue has created confusion around flag states accessing observer data to demonstrate their vessels’ compliance. This confusion also arises in some CCMs’ understanding of reporting requirements.
WCPFC11,611,"FFA members reported on 4 December that no CCMs had expressed concerns, and asked that the proposal be tabled for adoption by WCPFC11."
WCPFC11,612,"Japan commented that the independence of the observer is important but it was more important that observers and fishermen promote mutual understanding on their activities on the vessel. Japan stated that it was essential for them to have regular conversations with each other in order to promote mutual understanding. Japan believed the proposal would make the situation of observers on board worse by reducing communication although its aim is to protect them, therefore could not support the proposal."
WCPFC11,613,"Some CCMs expressed the view that a careful balance was needed on observer issues, and if the Commission is going to look at the ROP, it should take the time to review the whole programme, not parts of it."
WCPFC11,614,"One CCM commented that the proposal points to the importance of better working relationships between observer providers and flag States and expressed the view that the relationship between the FFA and USA was a good model. This CCM could not support the proposal to delete para 1 of Attachment K, Annex B of CMM 2007-01, believing that respecting the contents of observer reports and preventing errors in the report are two different issues. This CCM commented that during on board inspections in port, an inspector shows the report to the vessel master for signature, which cross-checks important facts. If the observer report has compliance-related information, para 1 verifies the fact 89  between the observer and vessel master. This CCM suggested that if the current provision compromises observer safety, perhaps the vessel master could have the opportunity to read the observer report once the vessel has returned to port and the observer has disembarked."
WCPFC11,615,"One CCM reminded CCMs that the Commission has been having this discussion for a few years. The proposal aims to simply remove the impracticality and confusion around this provision – observers are compliance officers and are on board to report. It is not appropriate for them to even have a conversation about matters they have to report on. It is also impractical, as observers are subsequently debriefed through a rigorous process."
WCPFC11,616,"Japan expressed the view that the provision should be improved, not simply deleted."
WCPFC11,617,The Vice-Chair commented that this was an ongoing issue and CCMs should find some middle ground before the Commission discusses it again. 10.8 Management Objectives process-related proposals 10.8.1 Harvest Strategy Proposal (FFA)
WCPFC11,618,"FFA members introduced (WCPFC11-2014-DP09 rev_1), which establishes a formal framework for the development of harvest strategy approaches for the WCPO’s key fisheries. A resource of such importance to many coastal states, especially SIDS, demands a formal management structure to ensure it is properly managed. The proposal notes the work the Commission and some members have already done on elements of harvest strategies. The proposal asks the Commission to commit to a formal management framework and outlines the key elements needed for this framework to operate. FFA members expressed their gratitude for comments received and asked for some time in which a small working group could meet to progress the proposal."
WCPFC11,619,The Chair noted the request for an SWG.
WCPFC11,620,"After consultations during WCPFC11, on 4 December Australia reported that the working group had met and a revised draft would be circulated for further comments, preferably in writing. After further consultations, Australia advised that WCPFC11-2014-DP09_rev4 was available and hoped to get a sense as to the Commission’s position in plenary."
WCPFC11,621,Several CCMs supported the initiative.
WCPFC11,622,"EU noted that it was one of the CCMs which had provided comments, which had been taken into account, and noted that this work was of extreme importance and money was allocated in the budget to bring it forward."
WCPFC11,623,"Canada commented that it moves the Commission in the right direction in providing clear parameters, both in terms of harvest strategies and implementation of Article 6, which calls for the application of the precautionary approach."
WCPFC11,624,"One CCM needed more time to consider the revised proposal, but in general had no difficulty going along with the proposal."
WCPFC11,625,Japan confirmed it can support the proposal.
WCPFC11,626,"The Chair commented that the comments around the table were encouraging, and asked the group to review the draft measure and get back to Australia."
WCPFC11,627,"After further consultations during WCPFC11, Australia tabled a revised proposal (rev5), explaining that there had been a formatting issue with rev4 but rev5 was the same in substance. On behalf of FFA CCMs, Australia sought support to adopt it.  90"
WCPFC11,628,WCPFC11 agreed to adopt CMM 2014-06: Conservation and Management Measure to develop and implement a harvest strategy approach for key fisheries and stocks in the WCPO (Attachment T).  10.8.2 Skipjack target reference point (PNA+ Tokelau)
WCPFC11,629,"PNA members and Tokelau presented WCPFC11-2014-DP12, a draft CMM to establish a TRP for skipjack, which is a further step for the WCPFC in implementing the precautionary approach through the application of reference points and a response to SC advice that the Commission take action to avoid further increases in fishing mortality, keep the skipjack stock around the current levels, and adopt a TRP and harvest control rules. The measure proposes that the Commission adopt a skipjack TRP of 50% of the spawning biomass without fishing, aiming to cap at around 50% the depletion of the adult skipjack stock by fishing, which is broadly consistent with maintaining fishing effort at the 2012 level, aiming to maintain economic conditions at their current levels with similar skipjack catch rates and catch size distribution to that seen now. In the short term, these CCMs hope to see the TRP used as a basis for scientific advice on skipjack and work on comprehensive purse seine effort levels. The TRP is a necessary component of a harvest strategy."
WCPFC11,630,"The Chair encouraged delegates to work with PNA and Tokelau to get the proposal ready for adoption, reminding the Commission that Japan has proposed a different TRP and the preference is to reconcile them and not have two different proposals."
WCPFC11,631,"After consultations held during WCPFC11, Tuvalu advised the Commission on 5 December that consensus was not reached on the PNA + Tokelau proposal, with CCMs close to agreement except for one CCM, which was deeply disappointing."
WCPFC11,632,Japan stated that the lack of data is a serious problem to determine TRP of skipjack and will do its best effort to report those data intersessionally for WCPFC12.  10.8.3 Skipjack target reference point (Japan)
WCPFC11,633,"Japan presented its proposal for a draft conservation and management measure on a target reference point of 60% of the estimated recent average spawning biomass in the absence of fishing for skipjack tuna (WCPFC11-2014-DP13), noting that skipjack tuna is a widely distributed stock through almost the entire WCPFC area, from 40˚N to 40˚S. Most of the catch comes from the tropical purse seine fisheries and in the west Island states in Areas 4 and 5. Japan observed that management interest appears to have focused on the tropical purse seine fisheries, with the difficulties of other areas overlooked. Skipjack stock is healthy according to the scientists, but Japan expressed the view that poor migration to northern area has been occurring, and is a problem. At beginning of the 2000s the catch decreased dramatically and has not come back to previous levels. The proposal is that the skipjack tuna resource should be recovered to the level before the local depletion was observed. Japan noted its efforts in scientific research, citing the four major skipjack migration routes to Japan, the western-most route shows a clear decrease in migration volume. Looking at this migration route and combining with tidal currents and area impacts as assessed by SC, Japan stated that it is clear that the origins of the western migration route are Areas 5 and 4, which are the most depleted areas for skipjack. Japan believes the local depletion problem can be solved by joint efforts of those members located in Areas 4 and 5. Japan proposes the TRP be set precautionary at 60% of the estimated recent average spawning biomass in the absence of fishing. Japan proposed that the approach should be consistent with other principles set forth in the Convention: a) stocks be managed in their entirety (Art. 5); b) due respect for artisanal fisheries (Art. 5 91  (h)); c) historic catch in an area (Art. 10. 3 (c)); and d) the needs of coastal communities which are dependent mainly on fishing for the stock (Art. 10.3 (g)). A copy of the presentation from Japan was tabled as WCPFC11-2014-DP26."
WCPFC11,634,The Chair thanked Japan for its presentation. This skipjack target reference proposal was not further discussed in plenary during WCPFC11. 10.9 Compliance Monitoring Scheme 10.9.1 Comments on the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (FFA)
WCPFC11,635,"FFA members gave their support for the CMS in seeking to assess compliance by CCMs. Further improvements can be made to the process. Referring delegations to WCPFC11-2014-DP10, FFA members noted that the number of obligations assessed each year has increased and will continue to do so as the Commission adopts more CMMs and more categories are added. These CCMs noted that the Commission has gone from reviewing 14 CMMs and scientific data rules in 2011 to 25 CMMs, Convention provisions and scientific data rules in 2014, and observed that the CMS small working group took the majority of the TCC’s time at TCC10. Allowing CCMs to provide additional information up to 30 days prior to the Commission meeting adds to this work. 15 CCMs have indicated that they have additional information which would revisit 79 potential compliance issues. FFA members have noted in previous meetings that this means members must review additional information in the margins of a heavily scheduled Commission meeting, which prolongs the review of information that are already for activities which took place the previous year. The current practice of assessing CMMs and rules for the relevant categories both at TCC and the Commission meeting cannot be sustained. The Commission should prioritize what gets assessed, and the FFA paper offers suggestions."
WCPFC11,636,FFA members also provided a second paper (WCPFC11-2014-DP23) specifically related to the CMS assessments of SIDS.  During WCPFC11 discussions of the recommendations proposed by FFA CCMs took place initially in the context of the presentation of the TCC10 Summary Report Recommendations related to the CMS process. Subsequently the draft recommendations were considered in turn through reporting back from the SWG led by the TCC Vice-Chair on the proposed CMM for CMS. The discussions and subsequent WCPFC11 outcomes based on the FFA recommendations have been grouped here into four topics: i. List of suggested priorities for compliance review by TCC11:
WCPFC11,637,"Noting that WCPFC11 had earlier agreed to prioritize the obligations that will be assessed by the CMS (paragraph 63 of TCC10 Summary Report), WCPFC11 considered a proposal from FFA members for a list of priority obligations for assessment in 2015 as set out in WCPFC11-2014-DP10. These include: operational data and aggregated data reporting and Annual Reports, catch and effort limits for key target species, and MCS tools. FFA members noted that they based this priority list on two key considerations:  (i) the crucial limits to ensure that fishing mortality for key target species are being maintained within sustainable limits and thereby fulfil the objective of the Convention – where non-compliance with such limits carry significant risk to the fisheries; and (ii) ensuring there is appropriate and sufficient information and verification tools which are fundamental to the Commission’s ability to make well-informed and meaningful assessments and decisions. 92"
WCPFC11,638,"The Chair observed that there needs to be a sense of priority, and noted that the concerns or recommendations from the Commission’s subsidiary bodies would be useful to hear."
WCPFC11,639,One CCM commented that a compliance assessment should be based on the requirement which is clearly written in CMM and Commission text.
WCPFC11,640,"The Interim-Executive Director agreed that the Commission should discuss what to prioritize in the CMS next year, as the CMR has become very large with a vast number of rows of information contained in the draft and provisional compliance monitoring reports. The Secretariat encouraged the Commission to consider prioritizing the measures it would like the CMR to concentrate on. The Interim-Executive Director noted that, owing to the new CMMs that came into effect in 2014, the proposed new draft CMM on CMS tabled for consideration at WCPFC11 (WCPFC11-2014-19a) would seem to suggest that next year’s draft CMR may be longer than this year’s CMR. The length of this year’s CMR did present challenges for CCMs, the TCC and the Secretariat."
WCPFC11,641,"The Chair suggested that the list of priority issues for the next compliance monitoring review, which may not be an all-inclusive list, be sent to the small working group."
WCPFC11,642,"During WCPFC11, the SWG Chair reported that a list of priority obligations was included in WCPFC11-2014-29. This list was prepared recognising that there is a large burden on TCC to get through its work."
WCPFC11,643,"Japan commented that it could accept the proposed list on the condition that there was a footnote against “operational data”, along the lines that ‘non-provision of operational data is not itself non-compliance if aggregated data and size data are submitted, according to section 3 of the data rules.’  Japan noted that some non-compliance issues in FAD closure raised by observer reports discussed at TCC10 are due to extreme implementation of the FAD definition and requested to add a footnote against “FAD Closure” along the lines that “practical implementation of FAD definition should also be considered”."
WCPFC11,644,"The FFA Secretariat recalled that the issue this CCM had was about the obligation to provide catch and effort data, but clarified that the list was only about what would be assessed, not what each obligation meant."
WCPFC11,645,The Chair asked if there had been any objection in the SWG to them. Japan responded that no participant except for FFA Secretariat and Japan made comments on the proposed list in the small group and that its comments (paragraph 642 of this report) were not reflected in WCPFC11-2014-29.
WCPFC11,646,One CCM stated that this was just a list and that the substantive discussions will take place at TCC.
WCPFC11,647,"WCPFC11 agreed that the list of obligations contained in Attachment U will replace the obligations contained in paragraph 3 of CMM 2014-07 Conservation and Management Measure for Compliance Monitoring Scheme and reflect the obligations that the Secretariat will assess for consideration by TCC11 during the Compliance Monitoring Scheme. ii. Convene CMS Working Group prior to TCC for at least two days in order to complete the review of each CCM and develop the draft Provisional Report, before convening TCC proper for three days."
WCPFC11,648,"FFA members proposed that the Commission formally recognise the CMS as a core function of TCC and specifically dedicate time to this work (WCPFC11-2014-DP10). They suggest that the CMS SWG convenes for at least 2 days prior to TCC, to review each CCM 93  and develop the draft provisional report, then convene TCC proper for the following 3 days."
WCPFC11,649,"One CCM expressed the view that if the recommendation was intended to dedicate sufficient time for the CMS SWG, this would not achieve that. This year’s deliberations took three of the five days, not two. This CCM’s preference is to extend TCC by one day, which reflects how long TCC takes and will continue to take."
WCPFC11,650,The Chair noted that this would make TCC 6 days in duration.
WCPFC11,651,"The EU noted that if the Commission was prioritizing measures to be examined, the Secretariat could be tasked to analyze which CMMs are related to provision of data or deadlines, which do not need so much time. The EU preferred to do the work in two days rather than three, and suggested it may be possible to streamline the work."
WCPFC11,652,"One CCM observed that by convening this work separately, before TCC proper, those who did not have to be there could go later. New Zealand supported ‘at least’ two days, but thought if the list could be prioritized, it should only take two days."
WCPFC11,653,"The Chair asked if it would be sufficient that in setting the agenda for this year’s TCC, the TCC Chair and Secretariat would ensure the CMS gets adequate attention within the agenda and at the meeting and could come back next year with a more definitive proposal if that does not work. It is clear that the CMS is a serious part of the Commission’s business now. The Chair also observed that it would not be easy for non-English speakers to work that intensively for so long. He also suggested that the Commission understood that there was a need to provide adequate time to conduct the compliance review."
WCPFC11,654,"One CCM made the observation that for at least the last two years, the Sunday is used at TCC for the small working group, which is a 12 hour work day, so effectively an extra day is already being worked by many. If the rules of procedure require a Commission decision to extend the meeting duration then that should be done here; it could not be put off."
WCPFC11,655,"One CCM opposed the recommendation, stating that once TCC starts the meeting gets a lot of work completed. Most of TCC’s time is allocated to the CMS process and this CCM could not agree to expand by more days. The CMS is an important task but TCC has other important tasks and the Commission’s capacity and budget should be considered"
WCPFC11,656,The Chair noted that extending TCC has budgetary implications which would need to go before FAC.
WCPFC11,657,"WCPFC11 subsequently agreed that TCC11 would be extended by a day (see Agenda 12.5)  iii. Conduct an independent audit and review of where the Commission stands in relation to delivering on the CMS objectives. The specific tasks could include an analysis of what impacts, if any, has the CMS had and what difference has it made in terms of any trends in compliance."
WCPFC11,658,"FFA members noted they are generally supportive of the current process used to undertake the CMR, but noted their belief that there is a need to task an independent review and audit of the CMS process to take stock of where the Commission stands in terms of its effectiveness and where efficiency gains can be made in meeting the CMS’ objectives."
WCPFC11,659,"Responding to a query from one CCM, the Interim-Executive Director responded that she expected the proposed independent audit would have budget implications."
WCPFC11,660,Several CCMs expressed the view that an independent look at the CMS will improve it.  94
WCPFC11,661,"The EU noted that the Commission budget was already increasing this year. An audit would require additional resources. This CCM asked the Secretariat for costings, suggesting a consultancy might cost USD50,000."
WCPFC11,662,One CCM noted that the CMS was just a few years old and was still finding its feet. It may be premature to put it through such a review and perhaps when the Commission has a longer term CMS measure it might be more appropriate.
WCPFC11,663,"One CCM noted that the measure had been in place for four years and was getting some footing. The audit would do a stock take, to ensure it is meeting its objectives. This CCM noted that the TOR would look at impacts and any difference the scheme has made."
WCPFC11,664,"The Chair summarized that it was an excellent idea but as a logistical issue, the Commission is going to amend the measure and engaging a consultant while it is being amended does not necessarily make good sense. The Chair suggested going through the revised scheme at the next TCC and then have the analytical work done."
WCPFC11,665,"The Interim-Executive Director recognized the CMS was a scheme which is still being shaped. The Secretariat sees merit in advice being given on the CMS and whether the volume of information the CCMs and TCC are being asked to review each year in CMRs, is achieving what people are hoping the CMS will achieve. To assist the Commission’s consideration the Secretariat offered to look at costing."
WCPFC11,666,"Reflecting on the comments, one CCM suggested it might be better to revisit the proposal next year."
WCPFC11,667,"One CCM cautioned that if the CMS process runs for too much longer without analysis, the Commission might get set in its ways, which risked only tinkering around the edges."
WCPFC11,668,"Some CCMs disagreed with the approach of independent audit of the measure. Japan stated that if there are difficulties with the measure, it is the members’ responsibility to change it."
WCPFC11,669,"The Chair asked if an audit should be set in motion now, or after the Commission has amended the measure and it is applied at TCC."
WCPFC11,670,"EU observed that the Commission has not even tried the new process and, though not opposed to the audit, done at the right time it would be more meaningful and beneficial."
WCPFC11,671,One CCM asked the Secretariat to provide some costings and asked for a commitment to agree a Workplan to do this in the near future.
WCPFC11,672,The Chair noted costs should be prepared for inclusion in planning for the following year.
WCPFC11,673,"Reflecting on its capacity, one CCM preferred a process which would continue on a trial basis while CCMs work through deficiencies at a national level. This CCM was especially concerned about the sanction part of the process, which would present difficulties."
WCPFC11,674,"WCPFC11 agreed that there should be an audit of the CMS at some point. The Secretariat was tasked with preparing a paper for TCC11, which will include consideration of the costs of conducting an independent audit of the CMS.  iv. Proposal to amend the CMM to provide for further recognition of the special requirements of SIDS in the CMS process (WCPFC11-2014-DP23)"
WCPFC11,675,"FFA members expressed the view that despite the clear obligation under Article 30 to assist SIDS, the Commission is only just beginning to actively mainstream the consideration of impacts on SIDS into the decision making of the Commission. Yet the Commission assesses SIDS against obligations that have been put in place over the last 10 years that did 95  not, when they were created, benefit from CMM 2013-06’s questions. These CCMs stated that continuing to rate these CCMs as non-compliant marginalizes them."
WCPFC11,676,"FFA members proposed an approach that in their view builds a fairer way of dealing with SIDS in the CMS process, starting with the Annual Reports, where SIDS can flag a specific assistance need early. The Secretariat and the SIDS can then develop an implementation plan, which will require a template to be developed which elaborates the assistance need and what it requires, and a plan and timeframes to meet it. The implementation plan would identify a budget and include funding sources for any financial assistance. It would be attached as part of the dCMR for each CCM, and would be part of the documentation reviewed by the TCC. Where TCC accepts an assistance need as genuine and its existence has meant the SIDS cannot fulfil a particular obligation, the TCC would not assess that obligation and would instead recommend to the Commission to allow the implementation plan to run through its agreed timeframes. Until the end of that agreed timeframe, the SIDS would not be assessed against that particular obligation. At the end of the agreed timeframe the need should have been met and the SIDS can then be assessed against that obligation. FFA members believed this approach recognises the unique and vulnerable situation of SIDS and territories. The majority of WCPFC CCMs are SIDS and territories, and the majority of fishing takes place in the waters of SIDS. WCPFC must find ways to shape measures and processes that include SIDS as equal partners and implementers of decisions."
WCPFC11,677,WCPFC11 agreed to further consider the proposal set out in WCPFC11-2014-DP23 through the small working group which was tasked with preparing a revised CMM for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (see Agenda 10.9.2). 10.9.2 Proposal for CMM on Compliance Monitoring Scheme (TCC Vice-Chair)
WCPFC11,678,"TCC Vice-Chair, Alexa Cole (USA), noted that the current CMS measure expires at the end of the year and directed CCMs to a revised measure (WCPFC11-2014-19a), noting that it was a redlined copy of last year’s measure. The TCC Vice-Chair noted that she had received comments on the proposal and was in the process of putting together a revised version in advance of the SWG discussions on 3 December at WCPFC11. This version will reflect discussions from the CMS-SWG held during TCC, Australia, FFA and Japan’s comments intersessionally and discussions which occurred during the CMS SWG sessions during WCPFC11."
WCPFC11,679,"After consultations during WCPFC11, the TCC Vice-Chair reported that the CMS CMM SWG was working through a number of proposed changes in WCPFC11-2014-DP23 and WCPFC11-2014-DP20_rev2 regarding capacity building for SIDS and prioritizing obligations, and was preparing a revised draft of the CMM."
WCPFC11,680,"On 5 December, the TCC Vice-Chair reported that a revision of the draft CMM for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme, WCPFC-2014-19a rev 1, had been posted and circulated. She noted that this draft reflects very productive discussions during several working group sessions during the week. There was broad agreement on many of the suggested revisions and the discussions provided several helpful new concepts that will improve the Compliance Monitoring process. The TCC Vice-Chair expressed that she would welcome any comments on the proposed revisions, but noted that it may not be possible to finalize the substantial revisions at this meeting"
WCPFC11,681,"WCPFC11 agrees to extend the existing CMM on the Compliance Monitoring Scheme, CMM 2013-02, for one additional year, and to modify paragraph 26 to read as follows: “This measure will be effective for 2015 only.”  96"
WCPFC11,682,WCPFC11 agreed to adopt: CMM 2014-07 Conservation and Management Measure for Compliance Monitoring Scheme (Attachment V)
WCPFC11,683,"WCPFC11 agrees that it is a priority to complete the work of revising and updating the Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMM, including addressing the proposals of FFA to address the capacity building needs of SIDS. WCPFC11 agrees that the United States will continue to progress this proposal intersessionally for adoption at WCPFC12."
WCPFC11,684,The TCC Vice-Chair also provided a draft recommendation from the SWG that the Commission agree to use the same template for preparation of the draft Compliance Monitoring Report in 2015 as was agreed last year at WCPFC10.
WCPFC11,685,WCPFC11 agrees that the Secretariat will use the same template adopted at WCPFC10 for preparation of the draft Compliance Monitoring Report in 2015. (Attachment W)
WCPFC11,686,"The International Seafood Sustainability Foundation made a statement on behalf of ISSF, WWF, Pew and Greenpeace, noting that this group has twice written (in 2013 and 2014) to the Commission to express their collective concerns regarding transparency in the Compliance Monitoring Scheme process (see WCPFC11-2014-OP13). These organizations expressed the following points: a. The principle of transparency is a fundamental hallmark of responsible collective management and all other tuna RFMOs allow accredited observers to attend their compliance committees, including making appropriate materials under discussion available either in advance of or during these sessions.  b. During the working group to revise the CMS, observer organizations offered several suggestions to balance the need to protect confidential information while also ensuring appropriate observer participation. Unfortunately, these suggestions were not afforded any discussion or consideration and the CMS process remains closed. c. Concern regarding compliance has been at the heart of a number of CMM negotiation discussions this week, highlighting the critical importance of a robust and transparent compliance process.  d. The Commission has a responsibility, under international law and under its own Convention, to promote transparency in its work and decision-making. We look forward to working further with delegations on revisions to the CMS CMM during the intersessional process and seeing further action in this regard at the next Commission meeting.   10.10 Proposal for CMM on Fisheries and Access Agreement Information"
WCPFC11,687,"The EU noted that this was the third year it had proposed this CMM (WCPFC11-2014-DP18), explaining that the primary reason for the proposal is transparency. The proposal asks that fisheries access agreements between coastal states and fishing nations are made publicly available. The EU clarified that its proposal was the same as for the last two years."
WCPFC11,688,FFA members stated that they did not support the proposal due to commercial sensitivities and the perception of interference by others on issues relating to national waters. These CCMs noted that the proponent has not taken these issues into account. 97
WCPFC11,689,"The EU responded that it hoped to receive comments from FFA members to enable it to better understand the precise nature of these members’ concerns, and would appreciate continuing a dialogue on this issue. AGENDA  ITEM  11  -  REPORT OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE 11.1 Budget approval for 2015 and indicative budgets for 2016 and 2017"
WCPFC11,690,"The Co-Chair of the FAC, Dr Paul Callaghan, tabled the report of the eighth meeting of the FAC, including a proposed Commission budget for 2015 in the amount of USD7,428,298 for WCPFC11’s approval (WCPFC11-2014-23). The FAC met three times during WCPFC11."
WCPFC11,691,"The FAC Co-Chair presented the report’s main points and recommendations, noting that:  FAC8 recommended that the FAM update the figures in WCPFC11-2014-FAC8-06 and that it be forwarded to WCPFC11 for endorsement. FAC8 recommended that the Secretariat continue to pursue unpaid contributions. (para 16 and 17)  FAC8 agreed to include a line item in the amount of USD25,000 in the 2015 WCPFC Budget for a job sizing exercise to be conducted for the WCPFC Secretariat by a consultant. (para 21)  FAC8 considered that the Interim-Executive Director should be compensated at the entry level Executive Director pay-grade (assuming this is higher than the Interim-Executive Director’s current pay grade) and be entitled to work-related allowances such as use of the Executive Director’s vehicle and business class travel. This compensation and allowance would only apply to an Interim-Executive Director appointed for a minimum term of four weeks and would apply through the Interim-Executive Director appointment. (para 27)  FAC8 agreed that the cost increases faced by the Commission are of concern. FAC8 agreed to task the Executive Director to undertake a review which would present options for a more sustainable budget in the longer term including cost savings and identifying other sources/methods of revenue. (para 40)  FAC8 agreed that developing harvest control rules is a high priority activity and should be funded. It was agreed to transfer USD83,000 from the SC budget for “other” projects (ranked by the SC as not high priority) to support the MOW in 2015. (para 47)  FAC8 agreed to a budget of USD113,000 for Targeted Capacity Building for 2015 which is comprised of a contribution of USD100,000 from Australia and USD13,000 from the WCPFC 2015 budget. (para 51)2  FAC8 agreed to include a line item in the amount of USD65,000 for regional capacity building workshops for 2015, and provisionally for 2016-2017. (para 58)                                                        2 Secretariat note: In comments provided on the draft report Australia has clarified that its contribution noted here to targeted capacity building would be via existing support directly to the FFA Secretariat.   98   FAC8 confirmed its support for a line item in the WCPFC budget of USD20,000 entitled “funding for Chair of Commission or subsidiary bodies if they are from a developing state”. (para 61)  FAC8 agreed to include a line item in the amount of USD7,800 to cover additional costs (DSA, venue and catering) associated with extending TCC by an additional day. (para 63)."
WCPFC11,692," It was further noted that the final 2015 budget figure would be finalised once decisions on the port coordinators proposal and the election of a new Chair were reached at WCPFC11. In addition, if it is agreed that WCPFC12 will be held over a weekend, an extra USD8,000 will need to be built into the Commission budget."
WCPFC11,693,"WCPFC11 adopted the summary report and recommendations of FAC8 (WCPFC11-2014-23 – Attachment X) and an eventual Commission budget for 2015 of USD7,556,298 (Attachment Y).   AGENDA  ITEM  12  -  ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS 12.1 Appointment of new Executive Director"
WCPFC11,694,"The five candidates shortlisted for the Executive Director position were interviewed by Contracting Parties during a meeting of their heads of delegation, and observed by members and participating territories, on Tuesday 2 December 2014 (WCPFC11-2014-24 and WCPFC11-2014-IP11)."
WCPFC11,695,"The Chair reported to the Commission the outcome of the appointment process on the morning of Wednesday 3 December 2014, advising that the top candidate was Mr Feleti P Teo OBE (Tuvalu). The Chair invited Mr Teo to address the Commission."
WCPFC11,696,"Mr Teo thanked the Chair, Ministers and heads of delegation for the opportunity to address the Commission as the Commission’s Executive Director designated to lead the Secretariat for the next four years. Mr Teo was humbled by the strong indication of trust and confidence in him and while he was still coming to terms with the enormity of the responsibility bestowed on him he assured the Commission that he would take on the charge of looking after the Secretariat. He noted that it was a joint responsibility and he asked each Commission member for support and assistance. Mr Teo thanked his government and particularly Minister Elisala Pita for their support even though the process had not required such support. Mr Teo sincerely looked forward to working with the Commission."
WCPFC11,697,The Chair noted that he likewise looked forward to working with Mr Teo and that he will inherit a very competent Secretariat whose staff will assist him. The Chair observed that the interview and appointment process had worked well but there were a few aspects which concerned him and he will refer these concerns to FAC to make the procedure more efficient.
WCPFC11,698,"On the last day of WCPFC11, the Chair advised the Commission that a contract had been signed by the incoming Executive Director and that he would be starting in March 2015. 99  12.2 GEF ABNJ Programme"
WCPFC11,699,"At WCPFC9, the Commission endorsed participation and in-kind co-financing for the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ) Sustainable Management of Tuna Fisheries and Biodiversity Project (Tuna Project). Mr Alejandro Anganuzzi, Project Coordinator for GEF-ABNJ Programme, provided a briefing on the current status of the Tuna Project (WCPFC11-2014-25), one of four projects under the Common Oceans Programme which aims to achieve global sustainable fisheries in ABNJ. The structure of the Tuna Project is based on partnerships with institutions including the five tuna RFMOs, governments, NGOs and subregional initiatives. WCPFC is a direct partner of the project. Mr Alejandro Anganuzzi stated that the Tuna Project can support the implementation of another MOW."
WCPFC11,700,"The Tuna project has three components:  Sustainable management: aims at the full implementation of the precautionary approach through the adoption of harvest strategies in the t-RFMOs. The Tuna Project will also support the preparation of ecosystem approach plans in each RFMO.  Reduce IUU fishing: supported through a number of strategies including capacity building for enforcement officers through establishing certification-based training; direct support to various initiatives to improve compliance by RFMO developing State members; creating templates to facilitate port State measures’ incorporation into national legislations; pilot e-monitoring trials; development of guidelines on best practices for MCS and market controls and traceability schemes; expanding a consolidated global record of authorized tuna vessels for the five RFMOs.  Reduce ecosystem impacts: supporting the collaboration between WCPFC and IATTC to develop integrated and consistent management plans for sharks; supporting, exploring and disseminating mitigation techniques for seabird mortality, including the development of a global portal to access information success of various techniques."
WCPFC11,701,"The Tuna Project principles are:   to facilitate global collaboration between RFMOs, in the spirit of the Kobe process and the joint work of the t-RFMO Secretariats.  to facilitate and accelerate existing processes in the t-RFMOs consistent with the Tuna Project’s objectives.  not to interfere with or duplicate existing efforts.  To leave implementation to the partners, whenever possible."
WCPFC11,702,"The Tuna Project focuses on global benefits, even when activities are regional or national. The Kobe process has been meeting for more than ten years. There are two global working groups seeking global common ground which were left orphaned. This project can reinvigorate this technical side and facilitate and accelerate existing processes. Mr Anganuzzi encouraged WCPFC to identify how the Tuna Project can help with ideas and processes decided in WCPFC with the Project can support. The project leaves implementation up to partners, like WCPFC, because the partners know what needs to be done. Mr Anganuzzi finished by noting that collaboration is the key to the project."
WCPFC11,703,"The Interim-Executive Director thanked Mr Anganuzzi on behalf of the Secretariat, including for the potential offer of support towards the MOW process.  100  12.3 WPEA SM Project"
WCPFC11,704,"Dr SungKwon Soh, WCPFC Science Manager and West Pacific East Asia (WPEA) Project Manager, provided a briefing on the current status of the WPEA SM Project. After the success of the first GEF-funded WPEA Oceanic Fisheries Management Project, UNDP and GEF provided the second project called Sustainable Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the West Pacific and East Asian Seas, which commenced on 28 October 2014 for three years. The Project Inception Workshop was held in Da Nang, Vietnam, from 4-5 November 2014. The objective of the project is to improve the management of highly migratory fish stocks in the WCPF Convention Area by strengthening national capacities and participation of Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam in WCPFC activities. Key activities include fishery data collection and sub-regional stock assessments, addressing climate change-related issues, and the ecosystem approach to fisheries management. The Science Manager manages this project through WCPFC’s in-kind contribution, assisted by national project coordinators and WCPFC staff."
WCPFC11,705,"Indonesia, along with the Philippines and Vietnam, receives assistance from this project, which has delivered benefits in capacity building and institutional strengthening in particular. Collaboration between this project and a national initiative allowed Indonesia to finalize its National Tuna Management Plan, launched by the Indonesian government in November 2014 during the Bali Tuna Conference. In order to secure support for effective implementation of this plan and to strengthen Indonesia’s contribution to global sustainable tuna management practices, Indonesia will hold the Bali Tuna Conference every two years and invite WCPFC members to take part. Indonesia advised that its average annual catch 2005-2012 was around 1.1 million metric ton per year, composed of 45% tuna and 55% neritic tuna. Around 76% was taken from Indonesian archipelagic waters and 24% was taken from its EEZ plus a small portion from high seas. Indonesia looked forward to WCPFC’s support for another three years."

WCPFC11,709,"Upon the election of Ms Rhea Moss-Christian, the Chair remarked that this is the first time that both the Chair and the Executive Director of the WCPFC are both from SIDS."
WCPFC11,710,"Some CCMs asked the Chair to clarify the arrangements in place to allow for his early departure on the afternoon of Friday 5 December 2014, and noted Rule 10 of the Rules of Procedure which provided for voting in a Vice-Chair for the unexpired term."
WCPFC11,711,The Chair advised that a Vice-Chair could be elected to replace Matt Hooper whose term does not expire until the end of WCPFC11.
WCPFC11,712,"WCPFC11 elected Ms Rhea Moss-Christian (RMI) to be Vice Chair for the unexpired term of the former Vice-Chair (which was due to expire at the end of WCPFC11), and in this capacity Ms Moss-Christian chaired the meeting from 3:25pm until WCPFC11 closed at 6:00pm on 5 December 2014."
WCPFC11,713,"In order to meet travel obligations, Dr Charles Karnella left the chair at 3:25pm on the final day of the meeting. The Chair made some kind remarks upon his departure, saying that he very much appreciated the work of the Secretariat staff and expressed his thanks to them, noting that they take great care of the Commission and he will miss them and all WCPFC participants. The Chair wished the Commission luck and thanked delegates, noting that the issues WCPFC faces are difficult but he has confidence they will find the best way to perpetuate the WCPO’s fish stocks."
WCPFC11,714,"The Interim-Executive Director sincerely thanked the Chair and remarked that the Secretariat very much appreciated his leadership, particularly for stepping into a gap left when the former Executive Director, Professor Glenn Hurry, left. The Interim-Executive Director commented that it had been a challenging meeting, and no doubt there were some disappointments. But there were a number of positive outcomes, including the commencement of an important dialogue amongst all CCMs through the Disproportionate Burden Workshop."
WCPFC11,715,"Although it had been a difficult week, PNG expressed appreciation, on behalf of all CCMs, for the Chair’s efforts at WCPFC11 and as Chair, a position from which Dr Karnella was stepping down. 12.5 Future meetings"
WCPFC11,716,"WCPFC11 agreed that:  SC11 will be held in Pohnpei, FSM from Wednesday 5 August to Thursday 13 August 2015.   NC11 will be held in Japan in early September 2015, with a specific date and place to be determined. 102   TCC11 will be held in Pohnpei, FSM from Wednesday 23 to Tuesday 29 September 2015.  WCPFC12 will be held in Bali, Indonesia from Thursday 3 – Tuesday 8 December 2015. As this period includes a weekend (giving delegates one free day) there will be a supplementary budgetary implication of around USD$8,000."
WCPFC11,717,"The Vice-Chair noted that details of other meetings to be held in association with various subsidiary bodies and, as appropriate, intersessional working groups in 2015 will be finalised intersessionally, with the Secretariat sending out Circulars with proposed dates and venues.  AGENDA  ITEM  13  -  OTHER MATTERS 13.1 Progress on the Performance Review of the Commission"
WCPFC11,718,The Interim-Executive Director noted that WCPFC10 tasked the Executive Director to revise the Performance Review matrix (contained in WCPFC10-2013-14) and to present the revised matrix to WCPFC11 (WCPFC11-2014-IP07). This was circulated to CCMs as WCPFC Circular 2013/128 (dated 20th December 2013).
WCPFC11,719,There was no discussion of this item. 13.2 Strategic Plan
WCPFC11,720,"The Interim-Executive Director noted that at WCPFC9, the Commission accepted a recommendation from the FAC that the discussions about the Strategic Plan take place at the Commission rather than FAC. While the Commission discussed the Strategic Plan at WCPFC10, there were no agreed outcomes."
WCPFC11,721,There was no discussion on this item. 13.3 Ad hoc task group – data (AHTG-Data)
WCPFC11,722,"The Vice-Chair asked whether the Commission wanted to elect a Chair for this group and restart its work, or whether there were any suggestions on a work plan."
WCPFC11,723,There was no discussion on this item. 13.4 Kobe process questionnaire
WCPFC11,724,"The Interim-Executive Director briefly introduced WCPFC11-2014-IP13, a questionnaire developed by the Kobe steering committee for each tuna RFMO to review and provide comments. The Interim-Executive Director suggested the Commission note the paper and set a tentative date of 15 February 2015 for comments to the Secretariat, which will collate and provide a revised or updated version to the Kobe committee."
WCPFC11,725,"Russell Smith (USA), head of the Kobe steering committee, explained that the questionnaire was a tool developed to identify the extent to which each of the tuna RFMOs 103  has addressed the recommendations that were adopted at the three Kobe meetings. It lists the recommendations against the five tuna RFMOs and tracks whether that recommendation has been implemented, for further review and comparison. Mr Smith noted that it was a useful tool to identify what WCPFC has done and what others have done and perhaps learn from them or identify mentors."
WCPFC11,726,WCPFC11 noted the Kobe process questionnaire (WCPFC11-2014-IP13) and tentative date of 15 February 2015 for CCM comments to be provided to the Secretariat.  AGENDA  ITEM  14  -  SUMMARY REPORT
WCPFC11,727,"The Commission will adopt a Summary Report of its Eleventh Regular Session out of session, as per its usual practice. The Secretariat will advise CCMs of the draft Summary Report and arrangements for finalising the Summary Report by Circular.   AGENDA  ITEM  15  -  CLOSE OF MEETING"
WCPFC11,728,"Speaking on behalf of NGOs, WWF stated that, despite best efforts, meaningful progress in WCPFC is at a virtual standstill, with virtually no meaningful substantive decisions taken: no new tropical tuna measure, no agreement on South Pacific albacore, no new compliance regime, to even agree to a plan to develop a plan to develop fundamental harvest strategies appeared to be too much of a commitment. These organisations thought it possible there was no hope for this process. Noting that the Commission adopted the Pacific bluefin CMM, WWF suggested that if it takes driving a stock down to less than 4%, the Commission should forego future meeting costs and transfer that money to SPC – until then participants are wasting time. Bilateral and multilateral meetings must take place before this Commission meeting comes together, to collaborate and cooperate in order to make progress at the meetings. WWF stated that the Commission has a collective responsibility to the world, the people of this region and the stocks on which they depend."
WCPFC11,729,"Samoa confirmed its willingness to host future Commission meetings, perhaps as early as 2016. Samoa thanked participants on behalf of the government of Samoa and the people of Samoa and wished them a safe trip home. Samoa thanked the Vice-Chair for her work."
WCPFC11,730,The Vice-Chair thanked Samoa for its offer to host future meetings.
WCPFC11,731,"The Hon. Elisala Pita, Tuvalu Minister for Natural Resources, thanked the Secretariat and the government of Samoa for their excellent arrangements for the meeting and hospitality. The Honourable Minister noted that Article 30 of the Convention requires that management measures should not impose a disproportionate burden on SIDS, yet there is still a debate about it, what it means, how it can be measured and how Article 30 can be operationalised. Distant water fishing nations continue to hold the view that the disproportionate burden isn’t real. Others, like Japan, try to apply it to their own countries. In Tuvalu’s case it is very real and can be illustrated by the FAD closure to reduce bycatch of bigeye tuna. Fishing on FADs is very profitable, however the current mechanism creates a disproportionate burden for Tuvalu, which is currently losing about USD2 million due to this FAD closure a year. Although Tuvalu and other SIDS accepted this FAD restriction, it is not working. In reality there is no significant reduction in longline catches as a result of 104  the FAD closure. Other arrangements impose a disproportionate burden, such as fishing capacity restrictions so SIDS can’t expand their domestic fleets, burdensome reporting requirements, multiple and concurrent meetings which small delegations struggle to meet. The decisions made by the Commission more and more do not favour SIDS. The Honourable Minister hoped that during the next meeting things go forward in a partnership, and accommodate everybody’s interests."
WCPFC11,732,"Indonesia expressed gratitude to the government of Samoa for hosting the meeting with such excellent facilities. This CCM also thanked the Chair, Vice-Chair and the Secretariat staff for the meeting arrangements and distinguished delegations from member counties for their partnership and collaboration at WCPFC11. As the hosting country of the 12th Regular Session, Indonesia looked forward to seeing participants in Bali."
WCPFC11,733,"The Philippines expressed their thanks and noted that in Samoa they have very much felt at home, noting this was not surprising given that their understanding that there are ancestral linkages between the Samoan people with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia region."
WCPFC11,734,"The Interim-Executive Director expressed her gratitude to the following people: Government of Samoa as hosts of WCPFC11, for providing the excellent facilities and for the opening function, with a special thanks to Faalavaau Perina Sila, the Ministry of Fisheries and Ministry of Foreign Affairs staff, Police, Security and Drivers, particularly Fale who drove for the WCPFC Secretariat; and the staff of the Fale’ata Sports Complex, including Ronnie and the multimedia team and IT support from Malua, James and Fetu. The Interim-Executive Director thanked the outgoing Chair, Dr Charles Karnella, particularly for his support to the Secretariat during the interim period. She thanked the Secretariat staff in Apia, SPC-OFP staff and rapporteur by name. She congratulated the incoming Chair, and noted that the Secretariat looked forward to working with her in this new capacity. The Interim-Executive Director congratulated the newly appointed Executive Director, Mr Feleti Teo, and noted that the Secretariat staff looked forward to welcoming him and his family to Pohnpei in March 2015. The Interim-Executive Director concluded her remarks with two Samoan salutations: Fa’afetai tele and Soifua."
WCPFC11,735,"The Vice-Chair echoed these words of thanks, especially to the Secretariat for their hard work. The Vice-Chair thanked delegates for entrusting the end of the meeting to her, and the future meetings she will chair. She looked forward to the Commission meeting next year before wishing participants a safe journey home."
WCPFC11,736,The meeting closed at 6:00pm on Friday 5 December 2014.

WCPFC12,6,A list of all participants is attached (Attachment A). WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)5  1.1 Welcoming addresses
WCPFC12,7,"After a Balinese welcome dance and warm appreciation to the government of Indonesia for graciously hosting the Commission meeting, the Commission Chair, Ms Rhea Moss-Christian, made some opening remarks. The Chair commented that global security challenges may make it hard to focus on fish, but food and economic security are also important. The Commission has an opportunity and obligation to ensure tuna supplies continue into the future. The Chair noted that at the end of the WCPFC11 meeting in Apia, Samoa the need to find better ways to conserve fish stocks was clear. The Chair noted the commitments members had made to cooperate in moving the Commission forward, and to turn discussion into action, and the Chair is committed to work alongside members and the Executive Director to facilitate this. The Chair thanked the Secretariat for its preparations for the Commission meetings this year, and the work of the Scientific Services Provider, SPC. The meeting would give maximum opportunity to focus on the conservation and management of four key tuna stocks, continue work on the Commission harvest strategy and adopt a work plan, and address the safety of observers – an issue for which there was much goodwill to attend to – and the special requirements of SIDS. The Chair noted that members depend on each other to realise their conservation goals and the status quo was not a long term option. The Chair commented that no territory wants to be the first to move lest it be a sign of weakness but, on the contrary, it was a sign of strength. The Chair’s opening statement is at Attachment B."
WCPFC12,8,"The WCPFC Executive Director, Mr Feleti Teo, OBE, made some opening remarks. The Executive Director noted that this was his first Commission meeting as Executive Director and reiterated his gratitude to Commission members for entrusting him with the responsibility to lead the organisation for the next four years. The Executive Director commented that the meeting brought the opportunity for change and the burden of responsibility and noted the late Nelson Mandela quote that negotiations and discussions are the greatest weapon for peace and development, a principle that is also applicable to managing the treasured fisheries resource of the WCPO. The Executive Director noted three priorities at the Secretariat level including: a) more regular dialogue as a foundation for driving change, b) an updated and reformed strategic planning processes and 3) a more strategic approach to communications to support efforts to connect more effectively with stakeholders guided by a two year communications plan now in place. The Executive Director offered some perspectives including that the scientists had been consistent and clear in observing that some WCPO stocks are subject to overfishing and are in an overfished state, and immediate and urgent actions required. In light of the scientific advice, the Executive Director commented that doing nothing was not an option; a view he observed also shared by the Commission Chair. He added that it is the collective responsibility of all members and stakeholders to rebuild overfished stocks. The Executive Director called for change agents and acknowledged delegations at WCPFC12 with the necessary networks and skills to drive that change and they needed to step up, particularly on the issue of the status of the bigeye tuna. The Executive Director thanked Indonesia for its generous hospitality and excellent meeting arrangements and to the Indonesian Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries for her attendance and looked forward to her wise counsel and guidance in her keynote address. The Executive Director’s opening statement is at Attachment C."
WCPFC12,9,"After acknowledging dignitaries and guests, the Republic of Indonesia’s Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, Ms Susi Pudjiastuti, made some strong opening remarks, emphasising the economics of the fishery, capacity, regulations to combat IUU fishing and the human side of effective fisheries management and healthy fisheries. Minister Pudjiastuti’s full remarks are at Attachment D."
WCPFC12,10,The meeting opened at 10:00am on Thursday 3 December 2015.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)6  1.2 Adoption of agenda
WCPFC12,11,"The Chair noted two changes had been decided at the heads of delegation meeting on 2 December 2015, immediately prior to WCPFC12: a) Agenda item 8 had been moved forward in the schedule to be discussed directly after agenda item 4, as it relates to criterion in CMM 2013-06 to be used when looking at new proposals, and b) Agenda item 18 (Other matters) would contain an update on the WCPFC VMS.  These changes were noted to have been included in WCPFC12-2015-02_rev2."
WCPFC12,12,"A brief discussion took place about the submission timing of proposals, with one CCM reminding the Commission that at WCPFC2 CCMs had agreed that proposals for new measure should be tabled 30 days before the meeting. It was noted that several proposals at WCPFC12 had not followed that process."
WCPFC12,13,"The Chair noted that in practice, on occasion, the Commission has considered proposals submitted within 30 days; it has depended on the nature of the proposal. It was up to the Commission to decide whether it wanted to strictly adhere to that WCPFC2 agreement, or admit the proposal then submit it to the process where its success was determined by the Commission after being guided by the proponents and worked on at the meeting."
WCPFC12,14,"EU noted it would be in favour of stricter rules as doing so would make examination of proposals and consultation with stakeholders easier, and in other RFMOs proposals are not taken into consideration if they are submitted after the due date."
WCPFC12,15,"The Chair suggested that the Commission allow proposals to be introduced at the relevant time in the agenda for CCMs to address as they wish, through small working groups or drafting groups. There was no objection to this."
WCPFC12,16,"The agenda was adopted with amendments (Attachment E). 1.3 Meeting arrangements 1.3.1 Establishment of small working groups (CNMs, CMS, others)"
WCPFC12,17,The following small working groups (SWGs) were established to deal with issues in the margins of the meeting before bringing them back to plenary for decision: a) tropical tuna measure CMM 2014-01; b) south Pacific albacore CMM 2010-05; and c) determining the participatory rights for CNMs.
WCPFC12,18,Chinese Taipei offered to lead the CNM SWG. Following further discussions Korea accepted a nomination to lead the CNM SWG. Australia volunteered to lead the South Pacific albacore SWG and the Chair volunteered to lead the SWG looking at the tropical tuna measure (CMM 2014-01).
WCPFC12,19,"In addition, a drafting group was established to consider amendments to the Compliance Monitoring Scheme measure, led by TCC Vice-Chair, Australia offered to lead a small group to consider the TCC work plan, EU led a group discussing sharks and Australia led a group discussing the Workplan for the adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06."
WCPFC12,20,The Secretariat was asked to prepare a list of working groups and the relevant contacts.  This was subsequently circulated to the meeting as WCPFC12-2015-09B. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)7
WCPFC12,21,"The Executive Director advised the Commission about meeting arrangements including facilities, catering, breakout rooms, document management, side-events, functions and the Sunday free-day tour hosted by the Indonesia government. The record of the meeting would be prepared by the rapporteur, Dr Jane Broweleit. The Executive Director identified the senior Secretariat staff in attendance at WCPFC12 including the Compliance Manager, Dr Lara Manarangi-Trott, the Finance and Administration Manager, Aaron Nighswander, and the Science Manager, Dr SungKwon Soh. The new legal consultant, Dr Penny Ridings, was welcomed, as was Victoria Jollands, an intern providing assistance to the Chair."
WCPFC12,22,"RMI noted that a SPREP-RMI jointly-hosted side event on marine pollution from vessels would be held in the margins of WCPFC12, a long overdue issue which RMI intended to take further next year."
WCPFC12,23,"During their first statements across the floor and during their country statements (Agenda item 3) many CCMs thanked the meeting host government Indonesia for its hospitality, warm welcome, meeting arrangements and enjoyable opening ceremony.  AGENDA ITEM 2 – REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR"
WCPFC12,24,"As required by Rule 13 of the Rules of the Procedures of the Commission, the Executive Director presented his Annual Report for 2015 (WCPFC12-2015-06). The Executive Director acknowledged the new leadership of the Commission with the new Chair and himself assuming office in March, 2015. With the Chair residing in Pohnpei, the Executive Director had ready and regular access to her counsel and guidance. The Chair’s support for reforms initiated in Secretariat had been gratefully received. The Secretariat noted three key priorities. The first is deeper member engagement through more consistent dialogue, noting that annual meetings were only part of the picture. The outreach program in 2015 included attendance at NC in September to meet with the Asian fishing states and had very productive discussions. Consultations with other members including observers were held at the margins of the SC11 and TCC12 with some consultations continued right up to the eve of the WCPFC12. Continued and regular engagement with all stakeholders will be a key feature of the way the Secretariat will operate in the future. The second priority is effective strategic and business planning, noting that planning activities will be more business-like in approach from now on. The Executive Director noted that the Commission’s current three-year plan and annual work program are not aligned, and there is no planning document that sets out the long term strategic vision for the Commission which may be used to leverage financial and non-financial support for the Commission from members, non-members and international funding mechanisms. A review of the planning framework will allow the Commission to develop a more cohesive planning framework. Thirdly, is enhanced communications with and between the Secretariat and stakeholders, noting a Communication Plan was launched in August and would be delivered over two years. The Executive Director observed that the media will cover the Commission’s activities whether the Commission engages with the media or not, and on this basis, under the plan there would be increased controlled engagement with the media. The Secretariat logo and website will also be updated."
WCPFC12,25,"The Executive Director noted the key work streams for the Commission which included the successful convening of the regular session of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies and the intersessional working groups and Harvest Strategy Workshop. The reports of the subsidiary bodies and intersessional working groups and workshop will be presented to WCPFC12. The Executive Director highlighted that 2015 had the most intensive intersessional work program since the Commission’s establishment. The Secretariat was also involved in project management activities as they progressed work on the ABNJ (Common Oceans) Tuna Project - the Sharks and Bycatch, and the WPEA Project which focuses on capacity building in data collection in Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam. Implementing the Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR) generated a sizeable volume of work, and it was pleasing to report that the draft CMR was completed on time and provided a sound basis for the TCC WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)8  to undertake its review. The Executive Director noted that further development of the IMS system and associated IT infrastructure are work in progress. As part of the communications plan, the second e-newsletter was distributed just prior to WCPFC12. The Executive Director noted that the 2014 financial statements were completed, with the Commission in a stronger financial position but a more long term sustainable funding model is needed. The Executive Director noted that the secretariat also manages the Japan Trust Fund and discussion were advanced with Chinese Taipei in efforts to establish a similar fund. The Executive Director noted the large increase in contributions to the voluntary fund in 2014, and registered the Commission's gratitude and appreciation to those that contributed including Australia, EU, Korea, USA, ISSF and FAO. In respect of the Special Requirements Fund, the Executive Director reported that it is now depleted and unable to support any request. The Executive Director thanked the Commission’s various service providers contracted to perform some of the Commission’s principal functions, especially the scientific services provider, SPC-OFP, and the VMS service provider, FFA. Close links with tuna RFMOs especially IATTC were acknowledged. Broad priorities for the Commission Secretariat for the future include deepening engagement with members and stakeholders, achieving tighter conservation and management for tropical tuna, developing the new strategic plan, continued focus on the CMS and IMS, VMS reporting standards and the CDS, and further development of the ROP."
WCPFC12,26,The Chair noted with appreciation the new leadership within the Secretariat through the Executive Director and the hard work of the Secretariat staff to keep members informed about and engaged in the work of the Commission.
WCPFC12,27,Many CCMs thanked the Executive Director for his comprehensive report and the work carried out by the Secretariat in 2015.
WCPFC12,28,"FFA members acknowledged that the Secretariat staff had carried the Secretariat for six months without an Executive Director last year, keeping the Secretariat functioning and delivering services. These CCMs supported the Executive Director’s efforts to develop a planning framework and strategic plan which was more streamlined. FFA members extended appreciation to the Executive Director and Chair for their proactive and consultative approach in 2015."
WCPFC12,29,"Korea looked forward to continuing programs that strengthen MCS and the scientific work of the Commission along with the further implementation of E-reporting and E-monitoring. This CCM advised that it was implementing E-reporting on a trial basis, with an E-monitoring trial following next year. Korea intended to engage in this work of the Commission with interested CCMs."
WCPFC12,30,"Some CCMs asked that ISC is included in the ‘service provider’ section of the Executive Director Report next year, as it provides a strong contribution to the work of the Commission through the Northern Committee."
WCPFC12,31,Japan enquired about the status of the arrangements between CCSBT and WCPFC mentioned at para. 47 of the Executive Director report.
WCPFC12,32,"The Executive Director apologised for the inadvertent omission of ISC and their scientific services to the NC and that it will be included in future reports. In response to the second query, the Executive Director explained that he was hoping to have an arrangement with CCSBT by the time of the meeting but this was not the case as CCSBT membership is yet to endorse the arrangement formally."
WCPFC12,33,"On behalf of the Pacific territories, France thanked the Secretariat and the Executive Director for their continued collaboration with IATTC. This CCM took the view that collaboration was particularly important and hoped it would continue in coming years. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)9"
WCPFC12,34,China noted that it continues to make a voluntary contribution.
WCPFC12,35,"PNG expressed appreciation for the proposed strategic and corporate plans, noting the terms of reference contained in Annex 1 of the working paper. PNG raised two points in this report: that the IMS system would be developed to improve and make more efficient the work of CCMs in carrying out their responsibility, and streamlining the work of the Secretariat. PNG requested more information on whether the Secretariat was going to increase its staffing to deal with the IMS and sought clarity on how the Commission plans to fund the review of strategic plan and corporate plan."
WCPFC12,36,"The Executive Director noted that the Secretariat continues to improve and upgrade the IMS as the platform from which the Commission undertakes its work. The Secretariat had completed a job sizing evaluation, as reported to the FAC. If the proposal to develop the new strategic plan and the associated corporate plans are endorsed under agenda item 17, those plans will have implications for staffing requirements. In terms of IT staffing, the Executive Director noted that a network administrator position currently exist and yet to be filled and the Secretariat is considering doing so soon. The Secretariat has not identified the source of the funding for developing the new planning document but looks to the membership to provide the funding if it is accepted as an essential work, however, there are discussions ongoing with some of the observers interested in supporting this work."
WCPFC12,37,"The Tuvaluan Minister for Natural Resources, the Hon. Elisala Pita, acknowledged the Executive Director’s report. The Minister noted that there had been a lot of talk but few results in the last few meetings and noted that last year’s meeting in Samoa had an element of disappointment for FFA members. The Minister was pleased to see the agenda for WCPFC12 had been shaped in an attempt to rectify those issues and for every member to work together to achieve the membership’s aim. The Minister noted that for the first time the Commission was led by a Chair and Executive Director from FFA countries. FFA members looked forward to this meeting to come together with other members to resolve issues which have been on the table for a long time."
WCPFC12,38,The Commission noted the 2015 Annual Report of the Executive Director  (WCPFC12-2015-06). AGENDA ITEM 3 – STATEMENTS FROM MEMBERS  AND PARTICIPATING TERRITORIES
WCPFC12,39,"Korea noted the full agenda for WCPFC12, especially for tropical tuna species, and hoped Commission members can come up with practical and effective solutions and have constructive discussions Korea looked forward to participating in these discussions to provide fruitful outcomes."
WCPFC12,40,"On behalf of Tuvalu, the Minister for Natural Resources, Hon. Elisala Pita, drew the Commission’s attention for the third year in a row to the critical importance of the decisions made at WCPFC12 to a small fishery-dependent state like Tuvalu. The Minister noted that last year in Apia it was agreed, through CMM 2014-01, to maintain the fourth month of FAD closure as a way to conserve bigeye. Tuvalu, with other PNA countries, rigorously implemented this but other WCPFC coastal states failed to impose the FAD closure in their waters, DWFN longliners did not deliver the bigeye catch reductions they committed to, and bigeye catches in the high seas have continued to increase. This year, PNA is proposing a revision to CMM 2014-01, prohibiting transhipment of frozen bigeye at sea, limit purse-seining in the high seas, and tighten up the FAD closures by prohibiting pre-dawn sets by purse-seiners. The Minister hoped and expected that members of the Commission will accept the refinements but if they do not Tuvalu will reconsider its position on the FAD closures. The Minister mentioned Tuvalu’s struggle to expand its fleet from one to two vessels and noted that Tuvalu would not agree to WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)10  capacity management measures until convinced that they are consistent with SIDS rights to develop their fisheries for their own benefit. The Minister wished the Commission well in its deliberations"
WCPFC12,41,"Philippines expressed its deepest appreciation to the Government of Indonesia for hosting WCPFC12 and the people of Bali. The Philippines noted its committed to ensuring the long-term sustainability of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks consistent with its rights and obligations under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and the WCPFC Convention. Philippines noted that its commitment is demonstrated in the progressive implementation of the Convention and CMMs, and cooperation with other CCMs."
WCPFC12,42,"On behalf of New Zealand, Ambassador for Pacific Economic Development, Shane Jones, thanked Indonesia and the Secretariat as hosts and organisers and noted that New Zealand attaches a high priority to the development of the region’s fisheries and recognises the importance of working together through this Commission. New Zealand strongly supported the strategies in the Regional Roadmap for Sustainable Pacific Fisheries that Leaders agreed to at the Pacific Island Forum, as Pacific Leaders expressed their objective of continuing to improve the sustainable management of fisheries. New Zealand noted the particular importance of committing to a TRP for the management of South Pacific albacore to help restore the economic viability of the southern longline fishery. New Zealand also noted the importance of improving the reporting on, and compliance with, conservation and management measures established by this Commission. Signs of pressure on some stocks was noted, with a need to ensure that harvesting remains sustainable, the burden of conservation is fair and that returns are delivered to countries that depend most upon this resource. The challenge for WCPFC12 will be to work through hard negotiations and compromise to make progress. It was noted that the highly charged tone of the Indonesian Minister’s speech set the scene for what those in a position of stewardship in the Pacific want to sustain, spread and entrench."
WCPFC12,43,"As the host country, Indonesia welcomed WCPFC12 to Bali, and noted that it has been 12 years since the Commission was established. Scientific advice now indicates that some species are showing signs of overfishing. This means the Commission needs to increase its effort to meet the common goals of all parties. Indonesia noted that developing harvest strategies and harvest control rules in accordance with CMM 2014-06 will increase WCPFC’s reputation as an RFMO with effective and efficient conservation and management mechanisms. Indonesia noted that it is developing a harvest strategy and/or harvest control rule for yellowfin and skipjack tunas within Indonesia’s archipelagic waters (Indonesia Fisheries Management Areas 713, 714 and 715) to ensure that tuna resources in Indonesian waters are managed with compatible measures adopted by RFMOs. Indonesia noted that it has received technical support from IOTC, CSIRO-Australia and the WCPFC WPEA project, as well as from NGOs concerned with tuna fisheries management. Indonesia commented that the Commission will find the way to show its commitment to ensuring the sustainable management of tuna resources as required in Article 2 of the Convention."
WCPFC12,44,"The CNMI expressed its gratitude to Indonesia for hosting WCPFC12 and advised WCPFC12 of the fishing arrangements that have been established between the U.S. Participating Territories, including the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Hawaii longline vessels, which allows Hawaiian vessels to fish, subject to strict limits set for the US Territories. These arrangements offer a critical source of funds that the Territories otherwise would not have, to pursue their fishery development aspirations. The CNMI is implementing fisheries infrastructure development including vessel docks and shore-side facilities, local fish market construction, fisher training including pelagic and bottom fishing techniques, and seafood handling training as a result of this opportunity. The CNMI stated that these arrangements are fully consistent with Commission decisions and noted that the CNMI does not have industrial fisheries at present; the benefits support CNMI’s small fishing communities. CNMI will submit a letter for circulation to the Commission providing further information on this issue. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)11"
WCPFC12,45,"American Samoa thanked the Government of Indonesia for being a generous and gracious host and noted that American Samoa is a US territory and also a developing participating territory with its own fisheries development aspirations and vulnerabilities. Its isolation and distance add high transport costs and make our products less competitive. As an economy that is highly dependent on tuna fisheries, American Samoa noted the need to keep its tuna fisheries viable, and supported the mechanism established under US law that allows the US participating territories to transfer a portion of its annual longline bigeye tuna catch limit to qualifying US vessels, process that takes into account Commission decisions, stock status and US territory fisheries development needs. American Samoa noted that its tuna fisheries and economy are threatened by labour issues, high safety standards, market forces and the loss of their historical fishing grounds, despite having a safe, deep harbor, with excellent facilities in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean. Effort limits and adverse economic conditions have slowed down the delivery of fish to American Samoa’s canneries and have affected the economy."
WCPFC12,46,"USA recalled the objectives of the Convention, and the task to support small island states and participating territories to develop and maintain their fisheries in a fair and equitable manner and in a way that supports the primary objective of the Convention, acting on the best available science based on timely access to high-quality, relevant data. The Commission has more work to do in terms of collecting information, such as through observers, and getting it to the scientific service providers while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the information. USA advised that it had a number of objectives for the meeting which are broadly described as improving the management of specific stocks within the WCPO and improving the way in which the Commission does its business. USA noted that its implementation of obligations under the tropical tuna measure, combined with actions by coastal states in the region, has imposed a high price on at least one US territory. This CCM is assessing the impacts of these decisions on communities which are dependent on access to these resources and will be asking for consideration of spatial approaches to longline fishery management and appropriate treatment of the high seas for purse seine fishery management. USA called on CCMs member to enact laws and regulations, rigorously monitor vessels, close fisheries when limits are reached, and take enforcement action against vessels that violate the rules. This CCM also called for a permanent CMS."
WCPFC12,47,PNG offered its sincere appreciation to Indonesia and welcomed the speech by the Indonesian Minister. PNG paid tribute to Charles Karnella for his leadership over the previous 4 years and congratulated the incoming Chair and new Executive Director. PNG has adopted enabling policies to provide a conducive environment for proactive fisheries management. The challenge for PNG is to transform this into practical human development outcomes. This CCM noted that the PNA longline vessel day scheme should bring in much-needed reforms and called on the Commission to adopt comparable measures and fully support the PIF’s fisheries roadmap. PNG noted that the special circumstances and vulnerabilities of SIDS was a fundamental consideration for this Commission as laid out in Article 30. PNG advised that it had signed a joint communique on IUU and transnational crime with Indonesia for actions in their respective national jurisdictions.
WCPFC12,48,"Australia recognised the importance of fisheries to the region, as an integral part of the cultural, social and economic identity of many members of this Commission and noted that fisheries are a critical contributor to Pacific Island revenues and underpin their capacity to build resilience and address development needs. The Commission’s challenge is to work together proactively to implement effective management arrangements for the key stocks. Australia has focussed over the last two years on promoting the development of harvest strategies for management of the Commission’s tuna fisheries and will work with members this year to agree on a workplan for this critical agenda. Australia supported the development of a new strategic plan for the Commission, recognising the importance of having a clear vision and plan to achieve it. Australia noted that WCPFC12 will be asked to consider a number of proposals that will directly contribute towards the development of harvest strategies, and hoped to see significant progress on these proposals. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)12"
WCPFC12,49,"Guam supported the statements provided by CNMI and American Samoa regarding its domestic arrangements with US vessels, and noted that this mechanism is important for the development of Guam’s local domestic fisheries. Guam advised that the Governor of Guam is making plans for the development of a locally-based longline fleet to supply its domestic market and local tourism-based economy. Guam announced its hosting of the SPC Festival of the Pacific Arts in May 2016, involving the participation of 27 Pacific island nations with 3,000 delegates along with thousands of visitors to follow FestPAC’s two week Olympic of Cultures. Guam wished delegations a productive meeting."
WCPFC12,50,"RMI noted that a number of key issues demand action by the Commission: developing mechanisms to ensure the health, well-being and safety of fisheries observers as they carry out their duties, a push for a more coordinated and practical approach by the Commission to transshipment and reconsideration of the application of the ‘impracticability’ provisions in the measure, the improved monitoring of fishing activities in high seas pocket 1 as concerns were raised at TCC about alleged IUU fishing activities inside the pocket, implementation of the criteria in CMM 2013-06 to help address the disproportionate burden, and the special requirements of SIDS and the checklist adopted through CMM 2013-07 being incorporated into CCMs’ business practices and a commencement of discussions and the formulation of budgets to support implementation of the CMM."
WCPFC12,51,Chinese Taipei noted that WCPFC has had significant achievements in enhancing conservation and management of highly migratory fish stocks in western and central Pacific Ocean. Recently some proposals and discussions have focused on economic interests and political consideration rather than constructive discussions on conservation and management measures. Chinese Taipei expressed its desire and willingness to make further efforts to facilitate the functioning of the Commission in ensuring long-term conservation and sustainable use of highly migratory fish stocks in this area.
WCPFC12,52,"FSM noted that its delegation included members of its national legislative body who have taken the time to observe for themselves the work of the Commission but also to learn more about what the Commission is doing to manage and conserve the fishery resources with the Commission Convention Area. As other Pacific Island countries do, FSM attaches great importance to their effective management because tuna offers the greatest opportunity for economic self-sufficiency and food security into the future. In addition, revenue from licensing represents a significant part of our local revenue and with declining revenues from traditional partners and the challenges of being a small economy, fisheries support our government’s basic services including health, education and social development programs. FSM seeks to develop them to create jobs and new economic opportunities and noted that it was ready to work with other members of the Commission towards that outcome. FSM stressed the importance of the Commission’s work and, as the host to the WCPFC Secretariat, reiterated its commitment to making the Secretariat function in an environment that is conducive to its effectiveness and efficiency in service to its members. AGENDA ITEM 4 – MEMBERSHIP AND OTHER APPLICATIONS 4.1 Status of the Convention"
WCPFC12,53,"New Zealand, as Depositary of the WCPF Convention, advised WCPFC12 that since its last report to the Eleventh Regular Session of the Commission in December 2015 in Apia, Samoa, New Zealand has not received notification of any instruments of ratification or accession to the Convention (WCPFC12-2015-05)."
WCPFC12,54,The Commission noted the Report on the Status of the Convention (WCPFC12-2015-05). WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)13  4.2 Update on Observer status
WCPFC12,55,"The Executive Director advised the Commission of applications for observer status and observers invited out of session to participate at WCPFC12. WCPFC12-2015-07 provided the list of observers to date, categorised as either IGO or NGO observers. There are 57 observers – 16 IGOs and 41 NGOs – and since WCPFC11 six new observers were admitted as per the Rules of Procedure."
WCPFC12,56,"FFA members noted the number of organisations now official observers to the Commission. These CCMs supported transparency and openness of Commission meetings, and appreciated the contributions of observers. However, they were concerned about some SIDS members being strained from year to year in meeting their annual assessed contributions and the escalating costs of the meetings due to the high numbers of attendees. These CCMs proposed that the Commission undertake some analysis and review of the current list of observers considering the following elements: a) the number of observers that had attended meetings; b) whether it was appropriate to limit numbers on observers’ delegations; c) whether it was appropriate for observers to pay an annual contribution towards the meeting costs; and d) how to accommodate treating separately observers which support the SIDS’ effective participation in the Commission – the SPC, the FFA Secretariat and the PNA Office – as these bodies are also separately recognised under the CMS measure."
WCPFC12,57,Executive Director noted that the matter of a fee was raised during FAC discussions early in the meeting. The FAC agreed to task the Secretariat to look into the issue of charging a fee for observers and report back to FAC next year. It was noted that if a further broader review was requested the Secretariat could accommodate that review.
WCPFC12,58,"The EU considered that a review could be a way forward, noting the number of observers participating. However, the analysis by the Secretariat should not be limited to a contribution to the cost of meetings by observers, but should also look at other issues and the way observers contribute to the work of the Commission, including issues relating to transparency and access to documents. This CCM was reluctant to see a cap placed on the number of observers and suggested the issues could be discussed together at TCC in advance of WCPFC13, not just FAC."
WCPFC12,59,"The American Fishermen’s Research Foundation suggested that, when thinking about setting a fee for observers, the size of the organisation, the number of delegates that attend meetings, and which observers are true stakeholders, such as harvest groups, should be considered. This observer organisation noted that it funds itself to go to the three WCPFC-related meetings each year."
WCPFC12,60,"The Chair noted the Commission’s general agreement to undertake a review of observer participation at the Commission, covering the elements which had been raised by FFA, EU and the observer group."
WCPFC12,61,"The Commission noted the updated list of observers provided in WCPFC12-2015-07 and tasked the Secretariat to undertake a review of observer participation at the Commission, covering the following possible elements:  • the number of observers which have attended meetings; • whether it is appropriate to limit numbers on observers’ delegations; • whether it is appropriate for observers to pay an annual contribution towards the meeting costs; • how to accommodate treating separately observers which support the SIDS’ effective participation in the Commission (specifically SPC, FFA, PNAO); • whether and/or how to accommodate treating separately observers that are direct stakeholders, such as harvest groups; • Transparency; WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)14  • access to documents;  and to report back to WCPFC13. 4.3 Applications for Cooperating Non-Member status"
WCPFC12,62,"The TCC Vice-Chair, J. Anderson (New Zealand) presented the TCC11 recommendations (TCC11 Summary Report para 117) in respect of the seven applicants, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam for WCPFC12 consideration (WCPFC12-2015-08). In accordance with CMM 2009-11 on CNMs, the Commission considered the seven applications which had been submitted for CNM status for 2016."
WCPFC12,63,"The Chair asked for general comments, advising that the Commission would then take each applicant in turn to consider their CNM status."
WCPFC12,64,"FFA members maintained that CNMs are to pay a contribution to the Commission as required under the measure and agreed at WCPFC11 – 50% of the amount that would be payable if the CNM was a member (agreed at WCPFC7), premised on the principle that all participants must share the costs of conservation and management of these stocks. FFA members thank those CNMs that have paid their contributions, and noted that Mexico’s contribution remained outstanding. FFA members recalled that this was a subject of extensive discussion at the last Commission meeting and in granting CNM status to Mexico the Commission was assured that they would investigate the possibility of a voluntary payment. These CCMs called on Mexico to update the Commission on these discussions and reiterated that FFA members do not agree to CNM status for any applicant with an outstanding financial contribution or who is unable to commit to making the contribution for next year."
WCPFC12,65,"Japan noted that overcapacity in the purse-seine sector is a major problem of the Commission and requested that the CNMs work together to solve this problem. Japan requested an update from Vietnam on the construction of vessels which could participate in fishing in the WCPFC area, and also requested Vietnam  continue to provide such information to prevent further expansion of the purse-seine fleet in the WCPO."
WCPFC12,66,"Vietnam stated that in 2015 one large-scale tuna fishing vessel was built in Vietnam. It was 100% owned by a French company. It was delivered in June 2015 and flagged to the Seychelles and operates in the Indian Ocean. At present, no construction of large-scale tuna fishing vessels is taking place in Vietnam and there are also no contracts for future construction of such vessels. There is no further construction in Vietnam taking place and no contracts for future construction. Vietnam emphasised that it wanted to fully cooperate with the Commission. However it noted that this discussion should not be part of the procedure of granting CNM status."
WCPFC12,67,The Chair asked if there was any objection to accepting Ecuador as a member for 2016.
WCPFC12,68,WCPFC12 agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2016 for Ecuador.
WCPFC12,69,The Chair asked if there was any objection to accepting El Salvador as a member for 2016.
WCPFC12,70,WCPFC12 agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2016 for El Salvador.
WCPFC12,71,The Chair asked if there was any objection to accepting Mexico as a member for 2016. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)15
WCPFC12,72,"The Secretariat was asked for an update on the status of Mexico’s contribution. It was confirmed that as of 13 November, Mexico had not provided a financial contribution (WCPFC12-2015-08)."
WCPFC12,73,Palau noted that as a SIDS it has problems making its contribution but has managed to do so. This CCM objected to Mexico’s application.
WCPFC12,74,"The USA expressed sympathy for Palau’s argument, but noted that it did not interpret the CMM in the same way, and in USA’s view the lack of a contribution did not provide a bar to participation. Rather, it was in the interest of the Commission to have Mexico participate, especially in NC on Pacific bluefin tuna, which was a stock in serious trouble and required work among all the countries involved whether on the eastern or western side of the Pacific. USA noted that Mexico had expressed a willingness to engage in the Commission and is essential to our solving the bluefin issue, and it would be a mistake to preclude them. USA further noted that in the past Mexico has explained the legal prohibitions it has, and that those prohibitions resolve if it could become a member of the Commission. This CCM suggested that a better course of action would be to agree to invite Mexico to become a member."
WCPFC12,75,"Canada, China, EU, Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei supported USA’s views. While expressing sympathy with the SIDS position, China suggested a voluntary contribution could be made through industry or an association. Japan noted that Mexico is the second largest Pacific bluefin tuna harvester and cooperation with Mexico is essential for management of this stock."
WCPFC12,76,"Nauru supported Palau’s intervention, noting that Mexico was not even in attendance."
WCPFC12,77,"Tokelau reiterated the FFA position from last year’s Commission meeting, whereby they would not agree to CNM status for any member that has an outstanding financial position and suggested that Mexico works on its legal constraints and applies for CNM status once that is addressed."
WCPFC12,78,The Chair noted that there is not a Commission decision to accept Mexico as a CNM as the application has not been accepted by consensus and this would be reflected in the report.
WCPFC12,79,The Chair asked if there was any objection to accepting Panama as a member for 2016.
WCPFC12,80,WCPFC12 agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2016 for Panama.
WCPFC12,81,The Chair asked if there was any objection to accepting Thailand as a member for 2016.
WCPFC12,82,"Japan commented that Thailand was accepted into the Commission because of its unique situation having large amounts of cannery data, as most of Thailand’s catch for canning comes from the WCPFC region, and requested Thailand to confirm whether information on its cannery data were provided to the WCPFC or not."
WCPFC12,83,Thailand noted that it requests data from the canning companies and submits it to the WCPFC each year.
WCPFC12,84,WCPFC12 agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2016 for Thailand.
WCPFC12,85,The Chair asked if there was any objection to accepting Vietnam as a member for 2016.
WCPFC12,86,WCPFC12 agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2016 for Vietnam.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)16
WCPFC12,87,The Chair asked if there was any objection to accepting Liberia as a member for 2016.
WCPFC12,88,WCPFC12 agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2016 for Liberia.
WCPFC12,89,"On 5 December Korea reported that the CNM SWG had met, with substantial discussion taking place on the six applications which had been accepted as CNMs for 2016. There were issues remaining and the group was waiting to hear from Mexico. Panama had made a request to include the term ‘supporting vessel’ and the SWG was exploring the implications of including that term. This SWG required another meeting to continue these discussions. The Executive Director noted that the Secretariat had a short time ago received a letter from Mexico with a commitment to pay the CNM membership fee. This letter was posted for all CCMs to read (WCPFC12-2015-OP19)."
WCPFC12,90,PNG sought clarification about whether the commitment is to provide the financial contribution which had been due this year or if it was for next year. This CCM noted that the Commission had already decided that Mexico’s application would not be accepted for 2016. PNG asked the Secretariat to seek clarification which payments were being committed to.
WCPFC12,91,On 7 December the Chair reminded CCMs that there had been questions about Mexico’s financial commitment for 2015. It was noted that a delegate from Mexico had now arrived at the meeting and he could address the application and the question of financial commitment.
WCPFC12,92,"Mexico noted that delegations will have seen the letter from the Mexico government (WCPFC12-2015-OP19), demonstrating Mexico’s interest to continue participating in WCPFC as a CNM. Mexico noted that it had participated in several meetings and fully cooperated with the NC and ISC. It provided information punctually and the information it provides is used by the Commission to make management decisions. Mexico noted that the main reason for Mexico's participation was not a need to fish in WCPFC waters, as Mexico had abundant yellowfin in its own EEZ. Rather, Mexico shared in the responsibility of managing the marine resources of the Pacific, and to participate in the technical and scientific committees of the two organisations. Mexico further noted that it only catches fish in the area shared with IATTC. Mexico stated that it would like to participate as a full member in the future. Mexico asked for advice from the Secretariat about the amount of contribution it was required to pay, whether it was voluntary and how it was calculated, and commented that it had not received information from the Commission in this regard. Mexico noted its understanding that some delegations had supported Mexico’s position during initial discussions early in the meeting, and hoped to work through the next steps to continue its CNM status."
WCPFC12,93,"The Secretariat advised that at the end of each annual meeting the Executive Director sends a letter to each of CNM applicant advising of the outcome. That letter includes the expected financial contribution, based on the approved budget. This was stated in the letter to Mexico and other CNMs applicants on 19 February 2015. In addition, follow up letters were sent following TCC11 which drew the attention of CNM applicants to any gaps in financial contributions. It was noted that these communications which confirmed the contribution amount were as per the decision made at WCPFC11 to do so. The Commission assesses the financial commitment of CNMs to be 50% of what that member would have paid if it had been a full member. Mexico’s contribution for 2015 was assessed at $27,070 – half of the $54,140 the contribution would have been if Mexico had been full member."
WCPFC12,94,The representative from Mexico noted that with a figure in hand he will report to capital. Mexico stated that the commitment to pay the due is in the form of a promise from the Mexico government to cover the dues as soon as possible. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)17
WCPFC12,95,"In light of the new information from Mexico, a lengthy discussion took place about whether the Commission was prepared to accept Mexico’s CNM request for 2016."
WCPFC12,96,"Several CCMs spoke in favour of Mexico being accepted as a CNM, with Japan outlining its support was based on Mexico being an important participant in the NC regarding Pacific bluefin tuna, a species which migrates to the EPO, and being the second largest harvester of the species. USA and China strongly supported the application, as did France on behalf of the French territories in the Pacific, due to the shared management of stocks and the cooperation between IATTC and WCPFC. EU considered the presence of Mexico and its participation in the NC work to be essential and hoped Mexico would become a full member in the future."
WCPFC12,97,"Nauru asked for clarification around whether, if the Commission accepts the application, Mexico has 90 days to pay and whether, if that payment is not forthcoming, the application is rejected."
WCPFC12,98,"The Chair noted the case of Senegal at WCPFC11, where a conditional acceptance was given, provided the payment was made by a certain date."
WCPFC12,99,Chinese Taipei noted that it could go along with others on imposing a condition and appreciated the commitment from Mexico of this payment. This CCM hoped the payment would be made by January or February.
WCPFC12,100,"Canada supported the inclusion of Mexico as a CNM but expressed doubts about the conditional aspect, noting that Mexico’s internal system for making the payment may need more time and that the WCPFC should go by the commitment when deciding on Mexico’s CNM status."
WCPFC12,101,"Philippines noted that it was satisfied with the commitment, noting that it was made by a representative of the government."
WCPFC12,102,"The Chair noted that there was support for the application but that the issue of payment not having been made was outstanding. The Chair noted the precedent which had been set at WCPFC11 to apply a condition to Senegal and suggested that members accept this as a way of proceeding, and that payment would be due 90 days after 15 January 2016, which is the date members are notified to pay their financial contributions."
WCPFC12,103,There were no objections to this.
WCPFC12,104,Mexico queried the decision to make the application conditional.
WCPFC12,105,"FSM supported Nauru’s comment on conditionality, commenting that last year the Commission had heard the same commitment. The condition would hold Mexico to making the payment within 90 days or it would lose its CNM status."
WCPFC12,106,"Japan noted that if the decision to make the acceptance conditional was based on practice not the measure relating to CNMs, the Commission could consider changing the current practice to be more flexible in order to accommodate Mexico. This CCM commented that WCPFC is the only tuna RFMO which obliges a budgetary contribution from CNMs, and noted that for CNM countries this is a budget issue with not only the fisheries ministries involved but also the finance ministries."
WCPFC12,107,RMI noted that there were reservations to the application and the established rule in WCPFC is that decisions are taken by consensus. Kiribati supported RMI’s comments.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)18
WCPFC12,108,PNG asked Mexico to clarify whether it would allow HSBI by WCPFC authorised inspection vessels.
WCPFC12,109,FSM noted the lengthy discussion both earlier in the meeting and during these current discussions and expressed concern that the Commission would be opening the door for others to take the same approach. This CCM encouraged Mexico to make the payment. FSM noted PNG’s question about HSBI and commented that this issue was raised as it was about Mexico agreeing to apply rules that are applied by other participants. This CCM noted that if Mexico is not accepted as a CNM it can still cooperate with the NC as an observer.
WCPFC12,110,"The Chair noted the lack of consensus on accepting Mexico’s application, whether conditional or not and discussions on the matter ceased."
WCPFC12,111,"Korea asked that the WCPFC legal advisor attend the 7 December CNM SWG meeting and on 8 December, Korea noted that a second draft had been developed and would be posted shortly."
WCPFC12,112,"On 8 December, Korea reported that it had taken on board all comments so far and would meet again during the lunch break. It was noted that the SWG had received confirmation that Mexico had paid its dues on 7 December, and the WCPFC Finance and Administration Manager had confirmed the transaction."
WCPFC12,113,"The Chair noted that the issue which was outstanding for Mexico was its payment, so there were no outstanding matters to address. The Chair suggested that the Commission now accepted the CNM application and the CNM SWG could now consider Mexico’s participatory rights."
WCPFC12,114,There were no objections to this.
WCPFC12,115,The Commission agreed to approve the application for CNM status in 2016 for Mexico. 4.3.1 Participatory rights of CNMs
WCPFC12,116,"In accordance with paras. 12 and 13 of CMM 2009-11, the CNM SWG reviewed the participatory rights of CNMs for the Commission’s adoption. On 8 December 2015, Korea presented the final report of the CNM SWG, WCPFC12-2015-31, outlining the participatory rights for the seven CNM applicants."
WCPFC12,117,"The Commission noted with appreciation the attendance and participation of Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand, and Vietnam in the CNM-SWG discussions."
WCPFC12,118,"The SWG agreed to recommend that the CNMs accepted by the WCPFC plenary (Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam) have the same participatory rights in 2016 as they had in 2015."
WCPFC12,119,"The SWG noted the recommendation from TCC11 that WCPFC12 take into consideration the Compliance Status of all CNM applicants in making its decision on the CNM applications and participatory rights, including encouraging them to rectify any gaps or issues in their applications prior to WCPFC12."
WCPFC12,120,"The Commission agreed that: a) In accordance with the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following participatory rights apply to Cooperating Non- Members (CNMs) for WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)19  fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area.  b) In addition, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under their national jurisdiction or other CCMs’ national jurisdiction, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements.  c) CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPF Convention and the WCPFC conservation and management measures. In addition, CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV). d) CCMs shall ensure that CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention.  e) Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will take into account -compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, and all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention. CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the TCC. Participatory rights of each CNM in 2016 Ecuador"
WCPFC12,121,The Commission noted Ecuador’s non-compliant status in CMR covering 2014 activities and encouraged Ecuador to aim for full compliance in 2016.
WCPFC12,122,"The Commission agreed that Ecuador’s participatory rights for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2014-01 or its replacement measure. El Salvador"
WCPFC12,123,The Commission noted El Salvador’s non-compliant status in CMR covering 2014 activities and encouraged El Salvador to aim for full compliance in 2016.
WCPFC12,124,The Commission agreed that the participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. The total level of effort by purse seine vessels of El Salvador on the high seas shall not exceed 29 days in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2014-01 or its replacement measure. Liberia
WCPFC12,125,The Commission noted that Liberia was not subject to compliance evaluation in CMR covering 2014 activities.
WCPFC12,126,"The Commission agreed that the participatory rights of Liberia are limited to reefer vessels to engage in transshipment activities, and bunker and supply vessels to support fishing vessels in the Convention area. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)20  Mexico"
WCPFC12,127,The Commission noted that CMR covering 2014 activities assessed Mexico to be in full compliance with all applicable CMMs.
WCPFC12,128,"The Commission noted that Mexico had participated in the work of the Northern Committee (NC) at NC 8, 9, 10 and 11 and, noting the need for cooperation with the work of the NC particularly in regard to Pacific bluefin tuna, encouraged Mexico to continue to participate in the NC. Mexico does not intend to have a vessel presence in 2016. The Commission agreed that any future introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2014-01 or its replacement measure. Panama"
WCPFC12,129,The Commission noted Panama’s non-compliant status in CMR covering 2014 activities and encouraged Panama to aim for full compliance in 2016.
WCPFC12,130,"The Commission agreed that the participatory rights of Panama in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels. At the request of Panama, and after consulting the Legal Advisor, the SWG noted that Panama’s participatory rights also apply to vessels that supply food, water and spare parts to carrier vessels that engage in transshipment activities, provided that these vessels do not engage in activities supporting fishing vessels, including providing and/or servicing FADs. The Commission noted that this does not result in any additional participatory rights in 2016 to the participatory rights granted to Panama in 2015. Thailand"
WCPFC12,131,The Commission noted Thailand’s non-compliant status in CMR covering 2014 activities and encouraged Thailand to aim for full compliance in 2016.
WCPFC12,132,"The Commission noted the need for cooperation between Thailand and the Commission and the commitment from Thailand to provide data from canneries located in Thailand to assist in the work of the Commission, considering that the CNM status was granted to Thailand for 2016 on the understanding that Thailand will cooperate fully with the Commission in the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data. The Commission noted the provision of data from Thai canneries and encourages Thailand to continue to cooperate with the Commission to improve the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data. The Commission agreed that the participatory rights of Thailand in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only. Vietnam"
WCPFC12,133,The Commission noted that in the CMR covering 2014 activities assessed Vietnam to be in full compliance with all applicable CMMs. Vietnam also informed the Commission that it had provided its assessed financial contribution.
WCPFC12,134,"The Commission noted the need for continued cooperation between Vietnam and the Commission to achieve compatibility of fisheries management and conservation, as well as on the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data, for which Vietnam would require assistance. The Commission noted its appreciation that the significant improvements in the collection and provision of data from Vietnam fisheries through the GEF WPEA project, administered by the WCPFC and encourages Vietnam WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)21  to continue to cooperate with the Commission to improve the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data. The Commission agreed that the participatory rights of Vietnam in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only. WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area"
WCPFC12,135,"The Commission agreed that: a. In accordance with the decision of WCPFC9 regarding the management of the overlap area of 4˚S and between 130˚W and 150˚W, vessels flagged to Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico will be governed by the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area. b. In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area. c. For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with international and domestic laws, vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area."
WCPFC12,136,The Chair thanked Korea for its leadership of the SWG which had worked through these issues.  AGENDA ITEM 8 – SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES 8.1 Updated checklist evaluation of SIDS special requirements (FFA)
WCPFC12,137,"At WCPFC11, FFA members submitted WCPFC11-2014-DP20_rev2 to assist developed CCMs to implement Article 30 of the Convention and CMM 2013-07 by targeting their assistance to specific requirements of SIDS. WCPFC11 agreed to use the checklist in that working paper as a guide when developing proposals. FFA members submitted WCPFC12-2015-DP01 to WCPFC12 as an updated list."
WCPFC12,138,"FFA members acknowledged the proponents of the proposals introduced at agenda item 5 which included an assessment against the questions in CMM 2013-06 para. 3. FFA members commented that ongoing engagement with those questions will improve the Commission’s ability to adopt measures that do not place a disproportionate burden on SIDS, or at least identify mechanisms within each measure to mitigate it. These CCMs emphasised that the questions should be given the intended consideration and provide detailed information, particularly to support conclusions about impacts on SIDS, disproportionate burden and impacts on SIDS’ development or access to resources."
WCPFC12,139,"Australia acknowledged the amendments and encouraged members to give CMM 2013-06 consideration as well as regard to Article 30 of the Convention. This CCM noted that the Commission has had difficult discussions about how to operationalise that article, but noted that a range of options were open to CCMs."
WCPFC12,140,"FFA members acknowledged that they did not expect proponents of measures to have an innate understanding of their issues, needs and vulnerabilities, which may make it difficult to provide WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)22  information and well-supported conclusions, but noted that this does not remove their responsibility to fully address CMM 2013-06. FFA members recommended that proponents consult with SIDS on these questions when preparing proposals and analysing their impacts – consultation which would help progress understanding of disproportionate burden and increase the Commission’s ability to avoid it. It was noted that FFA meets for its annual Management Options Consultation in late October each year which provides an opportunity for their advice to be sought in advance of WCPFC.  8.2 CCM reports on the implementation of Article 30"
WCPFC12,141,CCMs were invited to report on their initiatives to implement Article 30 of the Convention.
WCPFC12,142,"EU noted that its targeted assistance goes to multi-annual activities including training and capacity building. This CCM stressed that discussions about priorities take place directly with SIDS – for example the negotiations for EDF11, including the fisheries strand worth €35 million, were currently taking place in the region to identify priorities. This CCM considered that sometimes it is difficult to make a distinction with what is asked in terms of assistance to SIDS in WCPFC and asked that where needs are identified with development agencies there should be discussions in those fora, explaining that EU submits the FFA checklist to its development agencies so it is taken into consideration for assistance."
WCPFC12,143,"Japan noted that it has been assisting developing states including SIDS for their development of fisheries by constructing infrastructure and capacity building through its official development assistance and Overseas Fisheries Cooperative Foundation (OFCF). This amounted to about USD400 million over the last five years. Japan also has supported SIDS through provisions of fisheries experts from OFCF and JICA and by receiving trainees from SIDS. This year, during the Seventh Pacific Leaders Meeting (PALM7), Japan pledged to provide no less than 55 billion yen in the next 3 years. This CCM noted its support since 2008 for capacity building in respect of statistics, and fisheries management and enforcement through the Japan Trust Fund. Japan also supported SIDS through an FFA Promotional Fund since 2008."
WCPFC12,144,"Chinese Taipei noted that it has fulfilled its commitment to enhancing capacity building in fisheries conservation and management and has implemented Article 30 and CMM 2013-07. Chinese Taipei’s long term fisheries sector assistance to SIDS included observer training and enhancing the MCS capacity of SIDS, technology transfer and support for the domestic fisheries sector. Chinese Taipei has held three observer trainings since 2010 through its Regional Observer Training Project and has assigned scholars and technical trainers to several SIDS for the benefit of local students, fishermen and technical staff for some years. Chinese Taipei noted that for many years it has encouraged investment in SIDS’ fisheries sector and noted its announcement at WCPFC11 that it will contribute a trust fund of USD2 million over 5 years to finance the implementation of CMMs in developing states. This will be established in consultation with the Secretariat."
WCPFC12,145,"China noted the Chinese government’s November 2014 decision to allow most products from SIDS, including fish products, duty free access to the Chinese market. China has also established loans of billions of dollars to encourage economic development in SIDS, including a joint venture with FSM for Kosrae to be a centre for longline vessel repairs in the Pacific. Chinese investment also focused don territories, with billions of dollars to establish a marine park in French Polynesia."
WCPFC12,146,"Korea acknowledged the special requirements of SIDS and noted that it was meeting them in various ways, including working to establish a UN FAO centre of excellence for fisheries-related tertiary education. Students, including those from Pacific island states, would be funded by the Korean government, including financial support while studying.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)23"
WCPFC12,147,"FFA members thanked CCMs for their updates and the assistance outlined in their Annual Reports Part 2, but commented that there was room for improvement, noting that: very few responses clearly articulated the assistance provided; several CCMs repeated their statements against a number of provisions; some did not provide any details, and; two CCMs provided no response at all. FFA members noted that the reports do not provide sufficient advice about assistance to SIDS and made no clear link between to the specific areas highlighted in the FFA list on SIDS priority needs outlined in WCPFC12-2015-DP01, and reiterated that the intention was to ensure the provision of systematic and targeted assistance to SIDS. 8.3 Review of implementation of CMM 2013-07 (Paragraph 20)"
WCPFC12,148,"Pursuant to para. 20 of CMM 2013-07, the Commission discussed progress on the implementation of Article 30 of the Convention and CMM 2013-07."
WCPFC12,149,"RMI gave appreciation for the changes made to the agenda to address concerns around CMM 2013-07, and commented that the CMM 2013-06 was not addressed well here. This CCM noted the link between the two measures as both address SIDS issues, and reminded the Commission of the explicit link to the 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement and 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Article 10 of the Convention addresses the adoption of CMMs. This CCM noted that CMMs are binding instruments while resolutions were not. WCPFC10 saw the adoption of two important measures, CMMs 2013-06 and 2013-07, providing that new proposals were required to be considered in accordance with their criteria. RMI asked that the record note that two years later this has not happened, and noted that the Commission is picking and choosing management measures it will implement. This CCM commented that this is not consistent with the Convention and the rules adopted to support the work and looked forward to assessing the proposals against CMM 2013-06."
WCPFC12,150,"The Chair noted that by its very nature this issue will be discussed throughout the meeting agenda. Late in the meeting, the Chair came back to this item."
WCPFC12,151,"RMI noted its disappointment in the lack of progress and implementation of CMM 2013-06 and requested that an assessment be conducted against the measure and that CCMs undertake consultations with SIDS regarding targeted assistance, taking into account the SIDS checklist. RMI called for the development of a way to ensure the sustainability of the Special Requirements Fund, so it was not reliant solely on voluntary contributions, perhaps by way of making it mandatory."
WCPFC12,152,"EU noted that it did its best to assess their few proposals against the criteria in CMM 2013-06 and asked what the process was for consultation with SIDS, practically. This CCM agreed that impacts were not easy to measure. EU asked for some pragmatic solutions regarding the consultations, including nominating a contact point."
WCPFC12,153,"RMI explained that the proposal was about enhancing engagement, and noted that FFA has a process for its lead-up to the annual meeting of WCPFC, including the October FFA Management Options Consultation meeting. CCMs were encouraged to email or visit, and FFA and PNA Commissioners were good contacts."
WCPFC12,154,The Chair noted that CCMs were open to enhancing and continuing those discussions.   WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)24  AGENDA ITEM 5 – INTRODUCTION OF NEW PROPOSALS
WCPFC12,155,"The Chair noted that the Secretariat had provided a list of proposals for new measures to be introduced (WCPFC12-2015-09).  Those which don’t relate to other agenda items would be introduced briefly under agenda item 5, with limited or no discussion on them and proponents requested to work in the margins with interested delegations. Initial discussions on the FFA proposal for a harvest strategy work plan would take place under the tropical tuna and albacore agenda items with the work plan being treated like a new proposal, and a decision on its adoption would take place under agenda item 15. The WCPFC IUU Vessel List and new proposals would both be introduced early then finalised later in the meeting after further discussions. The Chair urged interested participants to meet with the relevant contact person."
WCPFC12,156,"CCMs tabled new proposals, introducing them and explaining their rationale and key features (WCPFC12-2015-09). It was agreed that the proponents would lead discussions on the proposals in the margins of the meeting before being brought back to plenary for decision. FFA proposal for management of enclosed and semi-enclosed high seas areas"
WCPFC12,157,"FFA members noted the main points of the explanatory note in WCPFC12-2015-DP05, commenting that they had been raising serious concerns about IUU fishing on the high seas for years, particularly in regards to the high seas pockets surrounded by developing country EEZs on which they had consistently sought action. These CCMs noted some recent cases of vessels seen in high seas pockets that were not reporting to VMS or on approved vessel lists; the proposal seeks to improve monitoring and control of vessels fishing in these sensitive areas by turning all five of these enclosed and almost-enclosed areas into Special Management Areas. These CCMs used the wording of CMM 2010-02 for the Eastern High Seas Pocket Special Management Area as a template, with the only substantive differences the areas in which it applies and the addition of a ban on transhipment in these five areas. FFA members see this as essential as high seas transhipment has been shown to be a major IUU risk for the region, and the pockets in particular."
WCPFC12,158,There was no initial discussion on this proposal. The Chair advised the Commission that Vanuatu would lead on this proposal and work with interested members in the margins of the meeting. FFA proposal for enhanced port-based MCS measures
WCPFC12,159,"FFA members introduced WCPFC12-2015-DP10, to establish a clear process that enables CCMs to request assistance from port states and, in taking a risk-based approach, to help direct available resources. These CCMs considered this proposal to be a good first step in the development of broader port based MCS measures in the region, and noted that the proposal has been considered and revised through the TCC and WCPFC over the last two years and was at a stage where CCMs should be comfortable. FFA members welcomed the adoption of the CCSBT Resolution for a Scheme for Minimum Standards for Inspection in Port, and stated that it was similar to the current proposal which they hoped indicated that Commission members were now able to adopt a port inspection measure. FFA members noted that SIDS need resources and assistance to build their capacity to implement port-based MCS mechanisms to support CCMs requiring FFA members’ assistance in deterring IUU fishing. These CCMs noted the presence of members that have established port-based inspection schemes, and asked for their expertise and support to strengthen their own. FFA members identified specific areas for assistance (para. 22) and in a delegation paper submitted for discussion under agenda item 8."
WCPFC12,160,There was no initial discussion on this proposal. The Chair advised the Commission that Tonga would lead on this proposal and work with interested members in the margins of the meeting. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)25  USA proposed revisions to VMS SSPs related to ALC type approval
WCPFC12,161,"USA introduced WCPFC12-2015-DP13, a proposal to modify the VMS SSPs. The proposal was based on work done at TCC, and seeks to ensure that the Commission has a mechanism for removing approval for units that cannot actively communicate with the Commission VMS."
WCPFC12,162,There was no initial discussion on this proposal.  EU proposal for amendment of Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission.
WCPFC12,163,"EU introduced WCPFC12-2015-DP17, to make clearer the obligations under the scientific data provision measure to address issues TCC encountered when assessing certain obligations. The proposal sought to clarify that there are mandatory data to be transmitted to the Commission, sought to address the transmission of operational level catch and effort data, clarified roles across the states. In addition, the attachment had been modified. EU noted that it had received comments and invite CCMs to provide their views with a view to posting a revision as soon as possible."
WCPFC12,164,"RMI thanked EU for the proposed and support the intent of the proposal, given its direct link to New Zealand’s proposal on data rules. RMI requested that both proposals go to SC for review and advice."
WCPFC12,165,"Fiji supported this view, noting that it would impact on information on key tuna species and enquired how the extra data would impact fishing operations."
WCPFC12,166,The Chair directed CCMs to provide the EU with comments on the proposal. EU proposal for fisheries and access agreement information measure
WCPFC12,167,"EU introduced WCPFC12-2015-DP18, a proposal for a measure which would provide fisheries and access agreement information, noting that this was not the first time it had been proposed. The purpose was to increase transparency in the region of agreements between parties on access, which would be made public and provide information that would support the fight against IUU fishing. EU noted that similar arrangements had been adopted in IOTC and ICCAT and commented that it would be good practice to introduce similar practices in WCPFC."
WCPFC12,168,"FSM objected to the proposed measure, noting that the proposal continued to come back to the Commission with no amendments being made. Such a proposal had been rejected in 2013, there were substantive discussions despite objections in 2014. This CCM stated that the proposal had not taken into account some of the comments made, especially around commercial sensitivities."
WCPFC12,169,"The EU noted that it was happy to receive comments and take them into consideration for integration into the measure. EU recalled getting general statements previously, rather than suggested amendments or concrete comments, and noted it was not opposed to changes.  USA proposal for a list of obligations to be assessed during the CMS process"
WCPFC12,170,"USA introduced WCPFC12-2015-DP20_rev1, which detailed the work done in TCC to develop a list of obligations. The work was requested by TCC11, which USA led, and several members submitted their comments. USA noted that there were obligations on the proposed list that had not been assessed in the past. USA called for CCMs to contact the US delegation in the margins with suggestions on the list. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)26"
WCPFC12,171,"RMI commented that, as the proposal was for a binding measure, CMM 2013-06 and CMM 2013-07 needed to be taken into account."
WCPFC12,172,"USA noted that to reduce redundancies it had included one of the two measures on the list of obligations to be reviewed, and the specific matter to be assessed was the same in both measures. As it was not a proposal for a permanent measure but was instead work requested by TCC, USA wondered about the applicability of CMM 2013-06, noting that FFA had contributed a great deal to the list of obligations being presented."
WCPFC12,173,The Chair suggested that the TCC items be taken up when the TCC report is submitted to the Commission (agenda item 12.3) and that comments should be directed to the USA in the margins. TCC work plan
WCPFC12,174,"Australia introduced WCPFC12-2015-DP21, a TCC work plan for 2016-2018. Australia noted that it supercedes the Commission’s 2013-2015 work plan, which was due to expire. Australia had taken account of comments received to date and had posted a revised version for the Commission to review."
WCPFC12,175,The Chair directed comments to Australia.  TCC Chair proposal to revise the CMS CMM
WCPFC12,176,"The TCC Vice-Chair, on behalf of the TCC Chair, introduced WCPFC12-2015-20_rev1, proposed revisions to CMM 2014-07, the Compliance Monitoring Scheme measure. The TCC Vice-Chair explained that the proposed revisions seek to improve the compliance monitoring process to better suit the needs of the Commission, both in assessing compliance with obligations and to work towards improving the ability of all members to implement measures. Key proposed amendments are to consider the special capacity development needs of SIDS, Philippines and Indonesia when assessing compliance, and consideration of the assessment of flag states on obligations where there are ongoing investigations with timeframes not compatible with TCC reporting dates. There is a proposed amendment to reporting dates related to the compliance monitoring process, and ongoing discussions around the decision making process, and dates for a review of the measure and term of the measure. The TCC Vice-Chair noted that some matters were being worked through and an SWG would be taking up the discussions. It was noted that no CMM 2013-06 assessment for this measure had been undertaken, but the TCC Vice-Chair undertook to complete it in the coming days with the assistance of FFA."
WCPFC12,177,The Chair directed interested members to the TCC Vice-Chair to continue discussions. Proposal to revise CMM 2009-06 regarding transshipment
WCPFC12,178,"The IWG-ROP Chair (Ray Clarke, USA) introduced WP21a, noting that IWG-ROP4 had provided some recommendations on high seas transshipment monitoring, based on a paper prepared by the Secretariat (WCPFC-2015-IWG-ROP4-07). Proposed amendment 2009-06 to establish additional reporting requirements for receiving vessels (Attachment 5 of the IWG-ROP report), allowing the movements of observers to be monitored. The IWG-ROP Chair noted that the working group had, as guidelines, a suggested format for reporting to the Secretariat. Taking TCC’s editorial suggestions on the proposal into account and discussions with the Commission Chair, Commission Circular 2015/82 went to CCMs highlighting the proposed changes, which are outlined in WCPFC12-2015-21a. In response to a request for clarification, the IWG-ROP Chair directed CCMs to the working paper, where the language from the working group and a suggested revision in the box for easy reading were included. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)27"
WCPFC12,179,"RMI noted the proposal had highlighted the safety of observers, commenting that safety was paramount but it might be better to fix transshipment issues then look at the observer issues around transshipment. It was noted that the issue was the transshipment activity itself."
WCPFC12,180,"The IWG-ROP Chair explained where the language came from, noting that the IWG-ROP had specifically focused on the need to know whether observers were present on carriers or not – that the Secretariat knew they were onboard. It was suggested that the observer work and the transshipment work could be consolidated and dealt with at the same time."
WCPFC12,181,The Chair noted the linkages between ROP and transshipment issues.
WCPFC12,182,"RMI noted its intent to seek to consolidate them, and encouraged a general discussion to highlight the problem."
WCPFC12,183,The Chair suggested this be undertaken during the TCC or ROP agenda items.
WCPFC12,184,"RMI noted that there are two possibilities regarding transshipment which could be considered through the WCPFC12 proceedings – banning transshipments in the high seas or tightening monitoring of transshipment in the high seas, and increasing observer placements. RMI hoped to make those links and stated it would come back to plenary with an agreed way forward on transshipment.  AGENDA ITEM 6 – INTRODUCTION OF THE IUU VESSEL LIST RECOMMENDATIONS"
WCPFC12,185,"The TCC Vice-Chair, , introduced the relevant TCC11 recommendations relating to the WCPFC IUU Vessel List (WCPFC12-2015-10_rev2):  Para. 51. TCC11 agreed to include the FAIMANU V on the Provisional IUU vessel list.  Para. 66. A majority of TCC members supported the inclusion of the RONG DA YANG 28 on the provisional IUU list whilst a minority were against the inclusion of the RONG DA YANG 28 on the Provisional IUU List. TCC11 agreed to place the vessel on the IUU list with a note to WCPFC12 that consensus was not reached on this vessel.  Para. 76. TCC11 agreed to include the LADY EVELYN-8, the FV MASTER RUSTIN-4, the LADY EVELYN 38 and the LADY GELAINE 18 on the Provisional IUU list. In paragraphs 84, 85 and 89, TCC11 agreed to recommend to WCPFC12 that the NEPTUNE, the FU LIEN No.1 and the YU FONG 168 should remain on the WCPFC IUU vessel list."
WCPFC12,186,"FSM gave an update about the Philippines-flagged vessels which had been placed on the WCPFC Provisional IUU Vessel List for illegally fishing in the FSM EEZ – LADY EVELYN 8, F/V MASTER RUSTIN 4, LADY EVELYN 38 and LADY GELAINE 18. FSM acknowledged the Philippines government for the cooperative efforts in resolving the matter and advised the Commission that it had reached an agreement with the Philippines settling the matter. Consequently, FSM wrote to the Secretariat on 27 November 2015 to seek the removal of the vessels from the Provisional IUU Vessel List. This letter was circulated to CCMs. FSM advised that the Philippines had committed to putting in place binding measures to strengthen monitoring and compliance of their flagged vessels when operating in the High Seas Pockets to prevent further violations of FSM fisheries laws. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)28"
WCPFC12,187,Philippines thanked FSM for its goodwill and for lending support and vital information which enabled the Philippines to further its duty as a flag state and ensure their flagged vessels follow the rules. This CCM acknowledged the support of the WCPFC Chair and Executive Director for their advice.
WCPFC12,188,"Tonga and China stated that they had reached an agreement on the issue of the Chinese-flagged vessel RONG DA YANG 28, and Tonga would not be pursuing the IUU listing of the vessel."
WCPFC12,189,Fiji and France agreed to consult during the meeting in relation to Wallis and Futuna to try and resolve the issue during WCPFC12.
WCPFC12,190,The Commission continued discussion of the 2016 WCPFC IUU List in the margins of the meeting with a view to bringing final decisions back to plenary under agenda item 14 to adopt an IUU Vessel List.  AGENDA ITEM 7 – OBSERVER SAFETY
WCPFC12,191,"The Chair noted that observer safety has been a priority for some time now in the Commission and was the subject of intense discussions at TCC and the IWG-ROP this year, but this was the first Commission meeting which had elevated the issue to a separate high level agenda item."
WCPFC12,192,"The Commission Observer Program Coordinator, Karl Staisch, presented information on the issue of the safety and security of fisheries observers to facilitate discussions regarding the safeguarding of the safety and security of observers. The supporting paper for discussions on observer safety was WCPFC12-2015-11. It was noted that fisheries observers play a critically important role in the fisheries management process, providing fundamental scientific information and serving an indispensable role in monitoring the compliance of CMMs, national fisheries laws and being the eyes and ears for their country and the region. ROP observers need to have the training, tools and skills they need to do their job effectively, and work in an environment that is free from threats, harassment, intimidation and assault. Staisch noted that technology was available for a personal electronic device to be carried which offers a primary source of direct independent communications between the observer provider and observers onboard the vessels. The Secretariat provided information in Annex 1 on indicative costs and technological solutions. With the acceptance of the use of personal communicators for observers, an Emergency Action Plan which details observer programme/provider responses to emergencies involving observers will also be required. The working paper makes a suggestion to strengthen the Secretariat’s support of national observer programs to ensure the safety at sea of observers and contains four recommendations in para. 25, the costs of which are negligible."
WCPFC12,193,The Chair suggested that the recommendations could be considered here but also later in the agenda.
WCPFC12,194,"On behalf of WWF, the Association for Professional Observers, Birdlife International, Humane Society International, Greenpeace, Conservation International, and The Pew Charitable Trusts, WWF stressed that observer health and safety must come first and foremost, and that ensuring the collection by observers of the highest quality data is imperative for the successful and sustainable management of the tuna fisheries, and that this cannot be ensured if observers are forced to endure any kind of harassment, threats, intimidation or assault. WWF stressed that observers are husbands and fathers, wives and mothers, brothers and sisters, and named a number of experienced and professional observers that have tragically gone missing in the Pacific under suspicious circumstances. WWF noted that both vessels involved in Keith Davis’s incident are licensed to fish in the WCPO, and owned and flagged by WCPFC member states. WWF highlighted the good analysis put forward by the Commission with WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)29  recommendations that will help ensure the safety and security of observers deployed at sea, and encouraged their adoption at WCPFC12. However, these observer organisations noted that the analysis must require that in addition to disappearances, any assaults should be reported immediately to the WCPFC under the reporting standards, noting that physical assault is often the last step before a preventable tragedy. WWF addressed the cost of the technology necessary to protect observers and highlighted that the capital and operational costs for 2-way satellite communicators for each observer in the first year would be roughly equivalent to two good-sized yellowfin tuna at current market rates. These observer organisations noted that they were encouraged by the independent efforts of those observer programs and providers that have independently sought to implement the use of two-way satellite communicators by observers in WCPFC and IATTC. WWF commented that the Commission owes their observers the tools and skills they need to do their job effectively and free from threats, harassment, intimidation and assault."
WCPFC12,195,"USA agreed that the health and safety of the fisheries observers was of paramount importance and gladly supported the implementation of the recommendations as well as looking at other ways to ensure their safety, noting that the USA’s standards were higher than what is in place in the ROP and there may be some ideas from that jurisdiction that may be useful to consider implementing."
WCPFC12,196,"FFA members generally supported the recommendations outlined in the Secretariat paper and expressed the need for the Commission to urgently develop mechanisms and processes that promote and addresses observer safety and welfare concerns, including a review of current standards, procedures and guidelines for the ROP to effectively address observer safety concerns and inclusion of the proposed two new minimum standards for “Observer safety at sea” and “Emergency Action Plan” in the WCPFC Minimum Standards of the Regional Observer Programme. FFA members expressed their support for the pre-notification proposal recommended by IWG-ROP4, to enhance efforts to provide better support observer safety and security in line. FFA members noted concerns about the lack of commitment and inaction by CCMs to adequately manage reported incidents of obstruction, intimidation and threats made against observers. As observer providers, FFA members signalled their intention to undertake a comprehensive review of their procedures and mechanisms around safety issues in 2016."
WCPFC12,197,"Korea recognised the safety of onboard observer as an important issue, noting observers can be exposed to violence. This CCM extended deep sympathies to those who have faced such incidents. Korea noted that it has very strong legislative tools to deal with this issue, with provisions addressing the mistreatment or obstruction of observers and subjecting operators to criminal penalties and seeking to ensure that vessels operators continue training crews on issues of observer safety. This CCM wanted the Commission to find constructive ways to ensure safety on board, and was glad to be engaging with CCMs and contributing to the discussions."
WCPFC12,198,"Japan noted that among other things observers collect very important information for stock assessment, and the safety of observers must be ensured. In this respect, flag states and observer provider CCMs need to cooperate on observer safety issues. In relation to the Secretariat paper (WCPFC12-2015-11), Japan generally supported its approach but noted that the action plan had something which needed to be discussed further, particularly around remedial action; which requires Observer program to establish appropriate measures for addressing violations made against observers including a schedule of fines, and/or other punitive measures against captains or crew found to be guilty. This CCM requested more careful drafting of the remedial action, stating that it is the flag state’s responsibility to provide penalties to its fishers. This CCM commented that it was difficult for the flag state to punish fishers under domestic law without supporting information on the observer’s claim, stating that there have been misunderstandings on occasion between observers and crews which in some cases can lead to the observer feeling harassed. To prevent misunderstandings, this CCM noted importance of cross checking between observers and crews. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)30"
WCPFC12,199,"FFA members noted that intimidation, obstruction and assault of observers is against the national law of all FFA member states, for some members it is a criminal offence with severe penalties. These CCMs advised that there had been several cases where an FFA member has undertaken legal proceedings against a vessel operator and crew for such offences, and resolved to increase their vigilance, including through using the regional tools at their disposal such as the immediate suspension of vessels on the FFA Vessel Register where there are reports of such behaviour, and called on flag states to join them in these efforts."
WCPFC12,200,"Philippines noted that it was both an observer provider and a flag state, and joined other delegations in the collective effort to ensure the welfare and safety of Commission observers. This CCM recalled that TCC11 had heard about the case of a PNG national, an observer on a Philippines-flagged vessel, who was allegedly murdered in 2010. At TCC, Philippines had committed to conducting an inquiry into the case, and it learned during this inquiry that on the night this observer went missing the captain had taken steps to locate him and six Philippines crew had been indicted in PNG, with hearings conducted in November 2010. The court found insufficient evidence to commit them to trial for murder and there was no further investigation of the case. It was noted that PNG investigated and Philippines cooperated with that investigation. Philippines acknowledged it still is not sure what happened that night. This CCM reiterated that the safety of the observer is priority and it will continue to take measures to ensure their safety and security, noting that the responsibilities of flag states should be included in these discussions."
WCPFC12,201,"Australia agreed with others on the importance of the issue of observer safety. The Commission relies heavily on the scientific and monitoring data collected by observers in order to meet its objectives and it should go without saying that observers must be able to do their jobs unimpeded and in a safe working environment, free from threats and intimidation. This CCM noted the responsibility of flag States in this regard thanked Korea and others for the information on the legislative instruments that they have implemented. These send a powerful message. This CCM noted the number of comments supporting a cooperative effort and to this end and suggested that the recommendations could be expanded to include flag States."
WCPFC12,202,"Chinese Taipei noted its general support for the working paper, including the emergency Action Plan minimum standards. This CCM hoped to have more focused discussions on the details."
WCPFC12,203,PNG noted that it was the largest observer provider in the region and takes the safety of its nationals and nationals of other countries that provide observers to vessels in PNG waters. This CCM considered that loss of life should be a category of its own. PNG reiterated that its places the safety of observers at the highest possible level and took exception to any suggestion otherwise. This CCM maintains open case files on observers that have gone missing.
WCPFC12,204,"RMI noted all the discussions on observer safety and the commitments which had been made by CCMs and their general support of the recommendations and understood that to mean that there will be no abuse, intimidation or obstruction of observers from here on, and that at TCC13 there are no reports that observers had been subjected to these issues. This CCM noted that preventative measures are important and the recommendations were sound. RMI hoped CCM would take these messages back to their captains and crews and others involved that they take the issue seriously lightly."
WCPFC12,205,The Chair noted that WCPFC12 had not yet reached consensus on the issue and the agenda item would be left open in order for the recommendations to be further considered.
WCPFC12,206,On 5 December plenary resumed discussions on the observer safety issue considering the set of recommendations contained at para. 25 of WCPFC12-2015-11. The Chair highlighted the WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)31  recommendation in 25(a) to adopt two new minimum standards which would be required for implementation no later than 1 January 2017.
WCPFC12,207,"Japan commented that improvement was needed in the contents of the emergency action plan, with more consideration, especially around the relationship between the flag state and the CCM of the observer provider. This CCM asked for clarification whether adopting the recommendation in 25(a) meant that all the elements of the emergency action plan would also be adopted without any modification."
WCPFC12,208,The Chair clarified that this would be the case if 25(a) was adopted. Japan responded that it was difficult to adopt the original emergency action plan.
WCPFC12,209,"A number of CCMs had concerns about the remedial action aspect of the Emergency Action Plan for Observer Safety, and suggested changes to the second sentence of that sub-topic, emphasising that it was the flag state’s responsibility to provide penalties."
WCPFC12,210,"RMI sought clarification about these concerns, commenting that this recommendation was notwithstanding laws and regulations about observer safety which existed at the national level."
WCPFC12,211,The Chair clarified that the recommendation was directed at the observer provider and nothing in it pre-empts the national program from their normal processes.
WCPFC12,212,Korea suggested that the Commission may need to adopt minimum standards to help the observer program establish its own remedial action plans.
WCPFC12,213,"With amendments requested by Japan about 1) deletion of the second sentence of the remedial action and 2) inclusion of enforcement authority of the flag CCM in the follow up response action, the Commission agreed to the recommendation in 25(a)."
WCPFC12,214,"The Commission adopted two new minimum standards for ""Observer safety at sea"" and ""Emergency Action Plan"" for inclusion in the WCPFC Minimum Standards of the Regional Observer Programme, with an implementation date of no later than 1 January 2017 (Attachment F)."
WCPFC12,215,The Commission agreed to consider ways of strengthening the two proposals recommended by the IWG-ROP4 related to pre-notification process from observer providers (WCPFC12-2015-21b) and additional reporting requirements for carrier vessels operating in the Convention Area (WCPFC12-2015-21a) to complement and enhance efforts to provide better support to observer safety and security.
WCPFC12,216,"At the outset of the discussions around 25(c) - strengthening of reporting mechanisms in instances of interference, intimidation, threats, assault, or disappearance of observers – the Chair suggested that this would be something the entire Commission reports."
WCPFC12,217,"RMI noted that in considering the discussions on this issue that the Commission as a body places a high priority on observer safety, and takes on responsibilities including undertaking future work. There should be nil reports of incidents against observer’s wellbeing and, on principle, these incidences will never happen again."
WCPFC12,218,"The Commission agreed to support the strengthening of the reporting mechanisms within the Commission and among CCMs regarding instances of interference, intimidation, threats, assault, or disappearance of observers. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)32"
WCPFC12,219,"As an observer provider under the ROP, the FFA Secretariat commented that these recommendations focus on observer providers strengthening their procedures, but flag states needed to take the issue more seriously too. The FFA Secretariat expressed disappointment that the proposal relating to provision of reports to captains was so summarily dismissed, on the basis that it was not written down. It was noted that there had been prior discussions about the issue."
WCPFC12,220,USA commented that as an observer provider as well as a flag and coastal state it supported the recommendations. The USA has an active and thorough observer program and would be willing to assist the Secretariat if it receives a tasking to intensify its support to national observer programmes.
WCPFC12,221,"The Chair noted that we are talking about our own people, there is an expectation that this issue is not up for debate and there is clearly a dual responsibility."
WCPFC12,222,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat to intensify its support to national observer programmes to strengthen and enhance their capability in the areas of observer safety and security, including in support to safety at sea operations."
WCPFC12,223,FFA members asked that the Commission to request TCC12 to develop a conservation and management measure to guide flag CCMs’ response to emergency situations in the event of alleged observer safety incidents.
WCPFC12,224,"Japan requested that consideration would include observer providers’ responsibility, noting that not all incidences happen because of responsibility of vessel crew side only: some incidences happen because of miscommunications and misunderstandings between observers and vessel crews. This CCM commented that the existing system only has the observer reporting and sought a fair approach by including observer providers’ responsibility."
WCPFC12,225,It was noted that it is not TCC’s role to draft CMMs and unless a draft was prepared by the Secretariat a CCM would need to take the lead. Another CCM observed that this was about providing flag states with some guidance with how to go about the process should there occur an alleged observer safety incident.
WCPFC12,226,Korea suggested that the IWG-ROP be continued and tasked to draft a CMM for consideration at TCC.
WCPFC12,227,"The Chair noted that the issue under discussion was about tasking future work to strengthen the support the Commission gives to fisheries observers and that support should come from all sides and from anyone with an interest in protecting our own people. The Chair suggested that the Commission agree that additional work needs to take place, taking into account the responsibilities of all parties involved, with perhaps a CCM taking the lead."
WCPFC12,228,USA supported the Chair’s remarks framing the task and volunteered to take on the task of drafting a CMM on this issue. The Philippines wished to work with the USA on this document.
WCPFC12,229,"The Chair noted the clear support to continuing to strengthen responses on this matter, and noted that it would be revisited at TCC with attention kept on it through 2016."
WCPFC12,230,The Commission agreed that a CMM should be drafted for TCC12’s consideration and finalisation and WCPFC13’s deliberation on flag state responsibilities in the event of alleged observer safety.  The USA kindly offered to lead this work.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)33
WCPFC12,231,"Further discussion on IWG-ROP recommendations took place under 12.4. AGENDA ITEM 9 – REVIEW OF CMM 2014-01 (SKIPJACK, YELLOWFIN, AND BIGEYE)"
WCPFC12,232,"The Chair outlined that the discussions on the tropical tuna measure (including in the SWG) would take into account a general overview of stock status, the work of the subsidiary bodies on this issue, and the new proposals. 9.1  General overview of stock status (Skipjack, Yellowfin, and Bigeye)"
WCPFC12,233,"J. Hampton (SPC-OFP) presented a summary of the status of tropical tuna fisheries and stocks. It was noted that more detailed information is available in Tuna Fisheries Assessment Report No. 15, which can be found at www.spc.int/oceanfish. The total catch of tuna in the WCPFC Convention Area was a record in 2014, approximately 2.9 million t. The purse seine catch (2 million t) and the catch of skipjack (almost 2 million t) were also records. Catches of yellowfin tuna (600,000 t) and bigeye tuna (161,000 t) were similar to recent years. Purse seine effort appears to have reduced in 2015, on the evidence of VMS data, possibly due to economic conditions in the fishery. The distribution of purse seine effort has moved strongly to the east, in response to the current El Nino event, which is the strongest since 1987/88. Purse seine catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was relatively high through 2014 and in the first half of 2015, but declined somewhat during the FAD closure. Longline catch in 2014 increased slightly in spite of a reported decrease in effort. Consequently, CPUE for both bigeye and yellowfin tuna is reported to have increased strongly in 2014. As longline data for the most recent year are often revised, this observation is considered to be preliminary."
WCPFC12,234," The status of tropical tuna stocks was summarised as follows: • Skipjack catch has increased continuously over a long period of time, and depletion of the spawning biomass is now estimated to have reached 50% of the unexploited level. The stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. • Yellowfin tuna catch has levelled off since the late 1990s, and depletion of the spawning biomass is estimated to be around 38% of the unexploited level. The stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. • Bigeye tuna catch has been flat since the late 1990s, and depletion of the spawning biomass is estimated to have reached 16% of the unexploited level, i.e. beneath the limit reference point of 20% of the unexploited level. The stock is considered to be overfished and overfishing is occurring."
WCPFC12,235,EU commented that the data used for assessment are from the period 2011/2012 which made it difficult to ascertain whether the adopted measure is having an impact or not.
WCPFC12,236,SPC noted that this would be addressed in the next SPC presentation.
WCPFC12,237,Indonesia noted its appreciation to SPC for providing stock assessments. This CCM commented that SPC also provided stock assessment based on the region but that information was not presented here.
WCPFC12,238,SPC noted that its assessments provide information on different levels of exploitation and metrics by subregion; the presentation at WCPFC12 had just been shortened. The information requested by Indonesia was available in the stock assessment reports presented to SC10; there was also information available in the Tuna Fisheries Assessment Report No. 15. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)34
WCPFC12,239,"In response to a question from EU about the reduction in effort on VMS days presented, Hampton commented that some vessels may have left the region compared to previous years, and some vessels may be staying in port for longer periods of time, noting the difficult economic conditions in the purse-seine fishery at the moment due to low fish prices. Evaluation of CMM 2014-01 for bigeye tuna"
WCPFC12,240,"G. Pilling (SPC-OFP) presented WPCFC12-2015-12, an evaluation of CMM 2014-01 for bigeye tuna, both the performance of the fishery components (purse seine and longline) against the measure as written for 2014, and the potential for the CMM as written for 2017 to achieve its objective of removing bigeye overfishing. The evaluation indicated that purse-seine FAD set numbers and longline bigeye catch levels in 2014 were ‘provisionally on track’ with the levels of effort and bigeye catch anticipated to arise under the CMM specifications for that year. A separate analysis examined whether full implementation of the CMM, under the conditions specified for 2017 would ultimately removing overfishing of bigeye tuna. The challenge was that it was not possible to define precisely what levels of purse-seine effort and longline catch would result in 2017, due to “either/or” choices within the CMM (e.g. purse-seining CCMs could choose between a three month FAD closure and overall FAD limit, or a four month FAD closure), exemptions and exclusions, and decisions yet to be made. Three different scenarios for 2017 conditions were therefore used to examine this implementation uncertainty, but Pilling noted that there is no certainty any of them will be correct. The scenarios were: ‘pessimistic’; ‘2015 choices’; and ‘optimistic’. Only under the ‘optimistic’ scenario were CMM objectives achieved by 2032, with F less than FMSY and the risk of the spawning biomass being below the LRP at 2%. Examining the trajectory of F/FMSY assuming the optimistic scenario conditions remained in place after 2017, CMM 2014-01 objectives would be achieved on average 10 years after the end of the measure, i.e. in 2027. As WCPFC stock assessments generally report fishing mortality conditions three years in the past, this would imply that only in 2030 would stock assessments identify whether the CMM had been successful. However, Pilling noted that earlier stock assessments should identify if the trajectory of F/FMSY and risk of SB < LRP are ‘on track’ to achieve objectives."
WCPFC12,241,"EU thanked SPC for the presentation and requested that in the future, consultation takes place with members to allow them to contribute to the definition of scenarios to be considered and explored through projections to ensure the provision of a wider range of options and advice. This CCM commented that it would have been useful to have had a projection with the modalities of each year of the measure, the effect of the total FAD closure and hotspot analysis. Noting that the objective of the measure is to maintain the three stocks at MSY at a minimum, the EU asked a number of questions: how many years it would take to reach MSY, to clarify whether the projection was based on the assumption of a total FAD closure on the high seas, whether an indication is available of bigeye tuna recruitment from 2011, based on the recent projections, what level of recruitment was used in the 2014 projections, whether there were bigeye tuna hotspots in the high seas."
WCPFC12,242,"Hampton explained that the reason certain areas were identified as catch ‘hotspots’ is because that is where the majority of purse-seine fishing took place within the tropical WCPO. However, when considering hotspots in terms of catch per set, these were to the east of the tropical WCPO. Hampton noted that the largest bigeye tuna reduction by removing a certain number of FADs sets would therefore be achieved in the eastern area, where CPUE is considerably higher than in the western area, in the order of five times the CPUE."
WCPFC12,243,"Pilling explained that the spawning biomass at MSY is estimated to be slightly larger than that at the LRP. The results of the projections under the three scenarios examined within the projections would be close to SBMSY, but there would still be a high probability of the stock being below that level. As overall fishing levels were generally reduced within the scenarios, skipjack and yellowfin tuna should WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)35  remain above the SBMSY level. In the previous analysis of CMM 2013-01, SPC conducted the evaluation as the measure was written, before decisions about the fifth month FAD closure and other elements were subsequently taken. In turn, the high seas FAD closure was assumed to lead to those FAD sets moving inside zones. If the high seas FAD set ban (para 18) was implemented on its own, it removed 18% of the overfishing of bigeye tuna within the analysis. Addressing EU’s comment about multi-species issues, SPC noted that within the modelling, the overall purse seine effort was maintained, and reductions in FAD sets led to commensurate increases in free school sets. Previous analyses have shown that there was relatively little impact in shifting effort from FAD sets to free school sets for skipjack and yellowfin. Addressing the query about whether bigeye tuna recruitment patterns were consistent with the recruitment scenario assumed, Hampton noted that it was difficult to monitor recruitment in recent time periods; as the information comes from the stock assessments, the most recent estimates are more uncertain. Although SPC did not have a concrete assessment on recent recruitment levels, some information suggests that there could be higher recruitment coming through."
WCPFC12,244,"PNA members saw the assessments of the purse-seine and longline provisions as reflecting some positive trends in the tropical fisheries, with purse-seine effort declining, especially in PNA EEZs under the VDS. These CCMs noted that the 2-year average number of FAD sets in the area where the FAD closure was being applied was down by 14% in 2013 and 2014 – more than was expected from the additional fourth month of closure – and it was noted that effort is declining in the tropical longline fishery. However, the analysis also showed that these gains will probably not meet the objective of removing overfishing of bigeye tuna and PNA members observed that the paper made it clear that additional measures were necessary in both the longline and purse-seine fisheries."
WCPFC12,245,The FFA Secretariat asked about the time frames under each of the scenarios to get back above the LRP.
WCPFC12,246,"Pilling explained that SPC had modelled the high seas FAD closure as removing the equivalent number of FAD sets from the fishery. In response to the question from the FFA Secretariat about the time it will take the stock to recover to the LRP, facilitated by the SC-agreed assumption of more positive recent recruitments continuing into the future, SPC would need to look at the outputs from the projections but it may be relatively comparable between the three scenarios."
WCPFC12,247,Cook Islands thanked SPC for providing goals to assist management and commented that the current CMM was deficient as it was a flag-based rather than zone-based measure; it was indiscriminate and reinforced a system of flag-based rights over zones. This CCM encouraged FAD set allocations on a per zone basis as the Commission moves forward through these discussions.
WCPFC12,248,"FFA members expressed concern that the tropical tuna measure was highly unlikely to achieve its stated objectives because of flaws in both the purse-seine and longline measures and the issue of disproportionate burden. These CCMs identified weaknesses: for longline, the agreed reductions in the catch limits for the big fleets fall short of the SC advice, and that there is nothing preventing substantial growth in catches by other fleets; for purse-seine, the flexibility for flag states to choose between the three and four month FAD closure and the lack of limits on FAD sets outside of the four month FAD closure create the potential for substantial growth in FAD usage. These CCMs noted that these and other weaknesses are artefacts of attempting to apply management measures on a flag state basis, rather than a zone basis. These CCMs stated that when the Commission seeks to set flag-based limits and measures, there is almost always a need for a SIDS exemption as otherwise SIDS would be locked out, and acknowledged that the exemptions weaken the measures and have been exploited by several developed CCMs. FFA members explained that in the purse-seine fishery, the main management measure is zone-based effort limits, so flag-based arrangements for FADs are particularly incompatible. These CCMs WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)36  called for a fundamental change in management approaches to supporting zone-based management, which will also help address the disproportionate burden of FAD closures."
WCPFC12,249,"PNA members supported the SPC paper’s suggestion to consider revising the choice of FAD measures. However they stated that the problem is not simply a matter of the number of FAD sets, noting that the number of FAD sets was down but with no decline in purse-seine bigeye bycatch. PNA provided some proposals in that direction (WCPFC12-2015-DP12). PNA members saw improving the monitoring and verification of the high seas longline fishery as a high priority, noting SPC’s qualifications relating to reliability of the longline bigeye catch data."
WCPFC12,250,"On behalf of The Pew Charitable Trusts, WWF, Greenpeace, the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation, Conservation International and the International Pole and Line Foundation, Pew highlighted the urgent need for discussion and action on bigeye tuna, noting the stock was overfished, with overfishing occurring, and having breached the LRP. These observers stated that actions to date were insufficient to address this situation, and commented that more bigeye tuna was caught in the purse-seine fishery in 2014 than in 2009, when the FAD closure length was half as long. In addition, the overall tonnage of bigeye caught by all gears in the WCPO increased 5% from 2013 to 2014. They noted that the science indicates that the impact of longlines and purse-seine are approximately equal and opined that the fate of the stock cannot continue to be mired in an inability to make the decisions on managing this stock. The observers stated that the status quo is not acceptable and called on CCMs to agree to concretely improve the tropical tuna measure to achieve real reductions in bigeye mortality."
WCPFC12,251,"Japan commented that there was too much optimism around usage of the recent high recruitment because recruitment collapse may occur under the current level of spawning biomass of WCPFO bigeye, which breached the biomass LRP. This CCM took the view that SPC should provide another projection result using average recruitment for reference."
WCPFC12,252,"In response, SPC commented that this question was a critical one: if longer-term recruitment patterns were assumed, which are lower than that estimated for the more recent period, the outcome was more pessimistic. The analysis presented to WCPFC12 assumed recruitment consistent with the more recent period, utilising 2002-2011 recruitment deviations and the stock-recruitment relationship estimated in the 2014 assessment models. This was consistent with the recommendations from the SC, and reflected the improved information on recruitment provided by the commencement of the purse seine fishery that captures smaller fish."
WCPFC12,253,EU asked about the decreasing trend in purse seine effort in 2015 and noted that at SC11 SPC presented a paper on trends in purse-seine CPUE which showed that there seemed to be underreporting of fishing days. EU asked if SPC had explored this issue further.
WCPFC12,254,"Hampton elaborated that when SPC analysed the logbook data there appeared to have been an increasing tendency to declare an increasing proportion of days as in transit, not fishing. SPC was continuing to analyse those trends with the objective of correcting for it. The graphic presented to WCPFC12 which shows the evolution of purse-seine effort on a month by month basis for the years 2009-2015 is based on VMS data and is therefore not subject to the bias, giving a fairly solid estimate of at least that metric of fishing effort."
WCPFC12,255,Japan asked whether the fishing fleet may have moved to the IATTC area or stopped fishing due to low prices for skipjack or high access prices. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)37
WCPFC12,256,"Hampton explained that there was no hard data, and individual vessel behaviour could usefully be investigated. It was understood that some vessels left the fishery this year, some are staying in port longer between trips. These patterns may have been related to depressed economic conditions."
WCPFC12,257,"Indonesia noted the address by the Minister at the opening ceremony and commented that Indonesia now had a moratorium in place, with the aim of reducing fishing effort including for tuna. Seven large scale longliners did not have their fishing licences renewed, but this effort has moved elsewhere in the WCPFC area, meaning that no fishing effort reduction had occurring even though Indonesia reduced its fleet by 7 vessels. This needed to be taken into account."
WCPFC12,258,"RMI noted that the analysis gave the impression of the fishery being on track in 2014 and asked whether for the longline fishery there was enough data for the stock assessments, and whether more was needed."
WCPFC12,259,"Hampton commented that it needs to be understood that the fishery being described as ‘on track’ relates to how the levels of catch are evolving with respect to the way the measures are written. ‘On track’ does not necessarily mean that the long term objectives are going to be met, indeed they are unlikely to be met despite components of the measures being termed ‘on track’. Purse seine FAD option choice, for example, gives the measure a bit of looseness and the analysis reflects that. Hampton noted that in terms of the quality of longline data and the stock assessment, SPC has tried to get better quality operational longline data because they are used as key indices of abundance. Cooperation from the DWFNs is beginning to provide that information for stock assessments. SPC hoped that would continue as a long time series of longline data would make a more useful contribution to the stock assessments."
WCPFC12,260,"Noting the similar impact on the resource in terms of tonnage of both purse-seiners and longliners, Korea asked about whether there was a way to quantify the effect of the exemptions."
WCPFC12,261,"Pilling noted that the effect of exemptions were not analysed within the analysis, commenting that it was very difficult to quantify their impact on catch or effort. It was noted that the measure would perform more poorly than was currently evaluated if those exemptions were quantified and included within the analysis."
WCPFC12,262,"In response to a question from Indonesia about the decrease in VMS days in 2015, Hampton reiterated that there is no specific data to point to an explanation for this but it could relate to the economic conditions in the fishery, with boats spending longer in port, not fishing."
WCPFC12,263,China noted the scientific data behind the analysis and asked what fishing gear was more responsible for the bigeye tuna stock condition – longline or purse-seine. China also asked what kind of measures should be taken to have a more direct influence on restoring the stock.
WCPFC12,264,"Hampton noted that in the bigeye tuna ‘impact’ plot SPC quantifies the impact of the different fishery components. The impact, in terms of stock depletion, is approximately equally shared between the purse seine FAD set and longline fishery sectors at this point in time. Which one of those fishery sectors should be reduced was not a question for science and there may be many different combinations of reductions that would achieve the objective."
WCPFC12,265,"Pilling referred to Tables 1 and 2 in WCPFC-2015-12, noting that overfishing on bigeye tuna is not removed if the purse-seine and longline sectors remain as they were in 2012 – fishing mortality remained 21% above that at MSY. Because of the recent good recruitments assumed, the model does show the stock recovering above the LRP on average, but there is still a chance that it will remain below. Essentially, if fishing remains at 2012 levels and recruitment remains at recent levels, overfishing on WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)38  bigeye tuna will not be removed – the fishery may recover above the LRP on average, but with a risk (32%, 1 in 3) that it will remain below LRP."
WCPFC12,266,PNA members noted the great importance of ensuring the CMM is effective in meeting objectives for management and conservation of the tropical tunas. These CCMs requested that future evaluations of the measure should include an evaluation of the effectiveness of the measure for skipjack and yellowfin.
WCPFC12,267,"USA made some general comments in response to the discussions, including a request to SPC and the science community that new analyses be done that could help managers make decisions about how best to approach the management of this stock, in particular, the idea of looking at spatial management. This CCM saw the usefulness in receiving input from SPC on how to go about using such a tool, including where mortality is most occurring and reducing mortality in those areas, especially by the longline fleet. USA was interested in work being done on identifying a particular number of FAD sets that each country would be limited to, to see a reduction in bigeye tuna mortality in the purse-seine fleet. USA commented that the Commission needed to ensure the sustainable management of stocks in a fair and equitable fashion, with the Convention clearly providing that the rights of SIDS and participating territories are protected and their right to development of their fisheries and maintain their fisheries-related industries. This CCM noted with concern the impact that the tropical tuna measure had on the tuna industry and peoples in American Samoa and commented that when we adopt future measures, whether revisions to CMM 2014-01 or a new tropical tuna measure, these issues need to be taken into account, including the disproportionate impact caused by eliminating fishing on the high seas in favour of fishing in the zones of states."
WCPFC12,268,"In response to the USA’s comment, EU asked for clear mandate to SPC about what work would be required."
WCPFC12,269,Indonesia asked about the three scenarios and the purse-seine and longline sectors having similar impacts and asked what factor affected the model the most.
WCPFC12,270,"Pilling noted that the relative multipliers for purse seine and longline fisheries used in the model are not equivalent. A 20% reduction in the purse-seine sector is not the same as a 20% reduction in the longline sector, as the former would be applied to purse seine FAD effort, and the latter to longline catch levels. The same scalar applied to both fishery components does not mean the same level of overfishing removed on the stock."
WCPFC12,271,"Japan noted the discussions and stated that bigeye tuna fishing grounds around Japan have diminished, with skipjack migration to the waters around Japan drastically decreased due to failure of conservation effort. This was causing severe economic problems in Japanese coastal fishing communities. This CCM noted that it had raised this point for some years but the Commission has not introduced a concrete measure to accommodate these concerns."
WCPFC12,272,The Chair suggested that these discussions continue in the SWG looking at the measure. 9.2  Review of purse seine fishery measures (Paragraphs 14-29 of CMM 2014-01) and longline fishery measures (Paragraphs 40-44 of CMM 2014-01)
WCPFC12,273,"The Chair noted that a number of WCPFC subsidiary bodies and intersessional working groups included a number of recommendations which would facilitate a review by the Commission of CMM 2014-01 and the SWG which was established to further this review, focusing on the provisions for the purse-seine fishery (paras. 14-29) and the longline fishery (paras. 40-44). The Chair talked through WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)39  recommendations from SC and TCC (WCPFC13) to be taken up in the SWG.  Reference document WCPFC12-2015-13 was noted to contain the relevant recommendations.  SC11 recommendations"
WCPFC12,274,There were no objections to accepting the SC recommendations on this measure.  TCC11 recommendations
WCPFC12,275,"TCC11 had provided three recommendations prioritised by CMS process which were ambiguous or problematic: TCC11 Summary Report para 483: Due to its inability to assess CMM 2013-01, paragraph 28 (yellowfin tuna purse seine catch), TCC11 recommends that WCPFC12 agree that until appropriate limits have been formulated and adopted, this obligation should not be included as part of the assessment.  TCC11 Summary Report para 483: Based on its review of CMM 2013-01, paragraphs 49, 51 and 52, TCC11 recommends that the Commission clarify what is meant by the term “current” in each of these paragraphs by stating a specified baseline.  TCC11 Summary Report para 485: TCC11 recommends that WCPFC12 consider clarifying how to assess CMM 2013-01 paragraph 40 with regards to compliance and that the paragraph be revised to separate the catch limit obligation from the requirement to take remedial action in the following year."
WCPFC12,276,"Japan opined that the Commission needed to strengthen the measure to improve the condition of the stock and most of the effort should be put into improvement of the existing measure, rather than mixing up the science and compliance issues."
WCPFC12,277,"The Chair noted that the discussions should maintain that distinction, suggesting that when the Commission discusses the measures in terms of strengthening them it should also ensure the obligation is clear. It was noted that the work required of the Commission this year on CMM 2014-01 is to take into account advice from the SC, with TCC not to assess it until the limits are established."
WCPFC12,278,"The EU agreed that they are different issues, but commented that the discussions should also try to address the grey zones to find a solution to avoid problems at TCC.  FADMgmtOptions-IWG recommendations"
WCPFC12,279,The outcomes from the FADMgmtOptions-IWG were discussed under agenda item 12.5. HSW outcomes
WCPFC12,280,"The Chair noted that some of the conclusions of the HSW were relevant to the SWG discussions in the margins, in relation to TRPs."
WCPFC12,281,The outcomes from the HSW were discussed under agenda item 12.6.   WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)40  New proposals FFA proposal for a target reference point for skipjack tuna
WCPFC12,282,"FFA members presented WCPFC12-2015-DP06, a FFA proposal for a target reference point for skipjack tuna, which was well known, having been discussed at MOW3, SC11, TCC11 and HSW. These members thanked CCMs for the productive discussions and useful questions in the HSW and in an informal session afterwards. They noted gladly that there appeared to be consensus on an interim TRP for skipjack of 50% of the unfished spawning biomass. FFA would be making some minor amendments to the text to reflect the similar proposal from Japan as well as the comments provided by CCMs in the informal session, but were confident the task would not prove overly difficult. FFA would discuss the outstanding items in the proposal in the tropical tuna SWG meeting in the margins, discussions the Chair was leading and which would cover TRPs."
WCPFC12,283,The Chair noted that this proposal would be considered further in SWG discussions. Japan proposal for a target reference point for skipjack tuna
WCPFC12,284,"Japan noted that its proposal WCPFC12-2015-DP15 was also proposed at WCPFC11. Japan made a statement about the importance of skipjack tuna for Japan, commenting that drastic declines in the skipjack migration had made Japanese local communities fateful crisis. This CCM observed that it had raised this issue on many occasions but the measures produced have not addressed these concerns. Japan stated that most skipjack are caught in the tropical areas and the stock assessment is conducted based on the size of that catch, so the situation in Japanese local communities is not reflected in skipjack stock assessment. Japan noted the chapeau part of Article 5 of the Convention saying that “in order to conserve and manage highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area in their entirety, the members of the Commission shall, in giving effect to their duty to cooperate….” and Article 5(h) taking into account the interests of artisanal and subsistence fishers. In addition to this, Japan made reference to Article 10 paragraph 3 regarding consideration of the historical catch and the needs of coastal communities which are dependent mainly on fishing for the stocks in developing allocation criteria. At WCPFC11, Japan had proposed 60% of the estimated recent spawning biomass in the absence of fishing as the TRP for skipjack considering those factors. While Japan’s basic position has not changed, in the interests of preventing deterioration of the stock due to prolongation of the argument, Japan offered a compromise of a 50% of the estimated recent spawning biomass in the absence of fishing as the initial TRP with a review not later than 2019, based on scientific advice. Japan reported that concerned CCMs had held informal consultations with Japan the week before WCPFC12. This CCM noted that it seemed to be considered that the differences between Japan and the FFA on the issue are small. However, it was not true and was critical for Japan to retain content of paras. 3 and 6 of the proposal."
WCPFC12,285,"In response to a question about SC advice on the range contraction issue, Japan commented that SC did not have the capacity to analyse all phenomena, particular local conditions and range contraction and noted that the Commission did not see what was happening in its local communities. This CCM reiterated that highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area shall be conserved and managed in their entirety as stipulated in the chapeau part of Article 5 of the Convention."
WCPFC12,286,"FFA members commented that they had looked at Japan’s proposal and had accommodated some of Japan’s concerns into the FFA proposal. These CCMs noted Japan’s answers to the CMM 2013-06 questions, which came to the conclusion that a higher TRP would be better for SIDS. These CCMs asked how the rent was calculated and current levels of access revenue. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)41"
WCPFC12,287,"Japan acknowledged that it could not provide 100% accurate information because complete figures are not available, but reiterated that conservation and management of the stocks should be considered comprehensively; the Commission should consider the stocks in their entirety with recognition of interests of artisanal and subsistence fishers, and historical catch and the needs of coastal communities which are dependent mainly on fishing for the stocks."
WCPFC12,288,"A brief discussion took place about the range contraction issue, with one CCM recalling that SC11 had noted that Project 67 had demonstrated no statistical evidence for skipjack range contraction and Japan arguing that SC had not been able to determine local depletion because of the conventional approach. In addition to this, Japan noted the uncertainty that the current stock assessment cannot overcome effort creep. Finally, Japan announced that its scientists elucidated there were three migration courses of skipjack around Japan and the most western one had collapsed. This CCM stated there is a scientific evidence of skipjack range contraction."
WCPFC12,289,"The Chair noted that this proposal would be considered further in SWG discussions. FFA proposal for strengthening of CMM 2014-01 for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna"
WCPFC12,290,The Chair noted that this proposal (WCPFC12-2015-DP07) had been presented at the HSW and addresses the impact of flag-based choices in the FAD management section of the CMM. It would be considered further in SWG discussions. FFA revised proposal for a harvest strategy workplan
WCPFC12,291,"FFA members introduced WCPFC12-2015-DP09 the harvest strategy workplan, noting that the Commission has worked for a number of years to agree key parameters to guide the sustainable management of Commission area fish stocks. These CCMs noted that WCPFC9 agreed LRPs for bigeye, yellowfin, albacore and skipjack tunas, and the Commission has scientific advice on the implications of possible TRPs for some stocks. WCPFC11 adopted CMM 2014-06 establishing a harvest strategy approach for key fisheries and stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. The proposal captures the requirements in para. 13, for a work plan and timeframes for the development of these harvest strategies. FFA members advised that SC and TCC had provided input as have other experts and CCMs, and the proposal and related elements were covered at HSW. FFA members highlighted some features: the work plan reflects timelines for Commission work, it is not the place to decide issues related to the elements themselves; it is practical, and breaks the work down into logical steps. Australia commented that the FFA proposal for a harvest strategy work plan and timeline (WCPFC12-2015-DP09) was practical, acknowledging there is only so much that can be done in one year. It tries to be logical around the next steps and also recognises that a lot of work has already been done. The proposal asks that an element is introduced into the Commission meeting agenda to review progress."
WCPFC12,292,"China asked about the rationale for the timeframes for the four species, noting that the stock status of the four species were all different. This CCM commented that bigeye tuna has breached the LRP and should be the priority, with urgent work needing to be undertaken, while for the other three species the state of the stock was relatively good."
WCPFC12,293,"Australia, which is leading the work, explained that FFA members had drafted the work plan to reflect the status of bigeye, with the first step for this stock being to seek advice from SC around biologically reasonable timeframes for bigeye tuna. This CCM noted that tasking SC was a necessary first step under the work plan. Timeframes for remaining stocks and fisheries were based on what was achievable and built on existing work and there was no reason to delay development of harvest strategies for other stocks of fisheries until work on bigeye had been completed. The proposal recognised the WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)42  significant amount of work being undertaken on other stocks and invited CCMs to discuss these issues in the margins."
WCPFC12,294,The Chair noted that this proposal would be considered further in SWG discussions.  The discussions on this proposal were finalised under Agenda 15.   PNA members and Tokelau proposed revisions to the tropical tuna measure (CMM 2014-01)
WCPFC12,295,"PNA members and Tokelau introduced a proposal for revisions to CMM 2014-01 (WCPFC12-2015-DP12), offering a balanced set of measures in the longline and purse-seine fisheries that will improve the chances of removing bigeye overfishing and improving the basis for the management of tropical fisheries generally. These members noted that the major elements in the proposals were supported in principle by a majority of CCMs, and would be complemented by actions by PNA members in their waters. Next year, PNA will begin, on a trial basis, to register and electronically track all FADs in PNA waters, and introduce differential charging for fishing on FADs versus free schools, to create an incentive for fishing on schools not associated with FADs, adding to the incentives created by the MSC certification of the PNA free school skipjack fishery, the presence of the MSC-certified ‘Pacifical’ tuna products, and effort limits applied to longline fishing through the Vessel Day Scheme. The purse-seine proposals included a hard limit on high seas purse seine effort at the 2010 level, compatible with the limits being applied in PNA EEZs, a pre-dawn set ban during the FAD closure, extending coverage to the deployment and servicing of FADs by support vessels, providing for observers to be carried by support vessels, and a requirement for observers on ROP purse-seine trips to be sourced from other CCMs. The longline proposals were designed to address the unreliability of the longline catch data – especially important when catches are transhipped in the high seas, operational data is not provided by some fleets, and the fleets carry their own observers – and included a high seas longline closure, a ban on transhipment of frozen bigeye at sea, no operation under manual reporting when VMS breaks down, and increasing observer coverage on high seas trips to 20% with observers sourced from other CCMs. Other proposals related to capacity management provisions, which had resulted in obstruction of the development of PNA domestic tuna industries. The straightforward proposal revision to the CMM would clarify that construction of vessels for SIDS is not a matter for the Commission."
WCPFC12,296,Indonesia noted that it did not have any objections but noted Article 30 of the Convention which included developing countries such as Indonesia and paras. 49 and 52 of CMM 2013-01 provides opportunity to Indonesia and SIDS to develop fleets. Indonesia reserved its position in this regard.
WCPFC12,297,"EU queried the PNA presentation which referred to an increase of fishing effort in the high seas and noted that only 12% of catches are taken on the high seas; on the other hand it noted an increase of around 10% in catch in EEZs. Referring to WCPFC12-2015-IP02-rev1, this CCM commented that there was 1773 fishing days on the high seas in 2014 when there has been a limit applying under Attachment D of CMM 2014-01 of 2282 (days excluding the Philippines) which corresponds to a level that is 20% below established the limit. If the Philippines effort is taken into account the level in 2014 was still 30% below the limit applying under Attachment D of CMM 2014-01. If we take into account total days by all fleets, including those fleets not subject to the limits in Attachment D, we arrive to 5415 days that have been fished on the high seas which is still below the total hard limit. Looking more historically, in 2001 and 2014 across all fleets 7200 and 5415 days respectively were fished in the high seas whereas historical (2001-2014) average is estimated at 6454 fishing days on the high seas. EU has also pointed out that a CCM not listed under Attachment D of CMM 2014-01 has displayed an increase of its fishing days in the high seas of almost three fold between 2013 and 2014. EU asked PNA to elaborate on these figures in the SWG.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)43"
WCPFC12,298,"RMI noted an increase in catch in the high seas, noting that bigeye tuna from the high seas used to be a relatively small percentage, but this is no longer the case. The high seas share in 2014 over 12% purse-seine effort in the high seas in 2015 has more than doubled, pointing to a problem in the high seas fishery."
WCPFC12,299,"Japan asked that the package be discussed in the SWG.  Japan also asked about explanation of the reason for the combination of measures proposed as a package (for example, “high seas closure equal to FAD closure for high seas vessels” vs “ban on pre-dawn sets”)."
WCPFC12,300,"USA expressed interest in the statements about the increase in effort and bigeye tuna catch on the high seas and asked where and what fleets were responsible, noting the USA fleet was not seeing the same level of increase. In addition, USA asked proponents whether they had looked at what impact further restrictions on fishing on the high seas would have on participating territories."
WCPFC12,301,"The Chair noted that interested parties can take up these questions in the tropical tuna SWG, including discussions to reconcile the data. Japan proposal on joint reduction plan of purse-seine fishing capacity"
WCPFC12,302,Japan explained that this proposal (WCPFC12-2015-DP14_rev1) was aimed to establish a scheme to jointly reduce the capacity of large scale purse-seine vessels flying their flag larger than 24m with freezing capacity between 20N and 20S (LSPSVs) to the level of 31 December 2012 by CCMs other than SIDS as agreed at WCPFC10. Basic concept of proposal was the same as its proposal at WCPFC11: increased number of LSPSVs from that of 31 December 2012 shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis based on the number of LSPSVs flagged to each concerned CCMs as of 31 December 2012. New elements were 1) clarification of the number of vessels (22 - the difference between 31 December 2012 and 29 October 2015); 2) CCMs other than SIDS may transfer the quota; 3) further introduction of LSPSVs by SIDS after 29 October 2015 shall be addressed in 2020. Japan believed that the biggest cause of the failure of conservation effort was that there was no rule to control over-capacity of LSPSVs and looked forward to constructive and rational deliberation on this proposal.
WCPFC12,303,"EU asked about the metrics used in developing the proposal (i.e. number of vessels) and whether the proponent had considered alternatives such as well capacity, which EU considered would be more accurate."
WCPFC12,304,Japan acknowledged the point and said it would be considered during discussions.
WCPFC12,305,The Chair noted that this proposal would be considered further in SWG discussions. Outcomes of tropical tuna measure CMM 2014-01 SWG discussions
WCPFC12,306,"On the afternoon of 5 December 2015, the Chair reported that in the 4 December tropical tuna SWG meeting, the PNA proposal was discussed, however those discussions did not move the SWG forward. The SWG met again on 5 December to look at these issues from a different perspective but did not make progress on CMM 2014-01. Discussions had begun on the draft harvest strategy work plan but there was no agreement on a skipjack TRP. The Chair advised that the SWG would reconvene on 7 December when the Chair would put forward draft amendments to the measure for the SWG to consider. They were small elements and there would be no surprises. The Chair wanted to put on the record her concern that the working groups were not progressing as delegates had said they wanted to progress, especially the tropical tuna and South Pacific albacore SWGs. The Chair reminded delegates that status quo was not a long term option and the Commission might need to look at other mechanisms. The Chair WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)44  noted that some delegations would welcome a vote on some of these issues, while others would not. The Chair was also investigating the possibility of a conciliation process to work through these issues."
WCPFC12,307,"On 7 December, the Chair advised that she planned to hold a HOD meeting on 8 December to work through the amendments, followed by a HOD+1 meeting for technical drafting. A brief discussion took place as several members preferred that both meetings would be HOD+1. The Chair noted these views and both meetings would be HOD+1. The Chair stressed that these CCMs should come ready to be constructive to move the measure forward. SPC, FFA and PNA Secretariat would attend as Secretariat support. The Chair asked Cook Islands, FSM, Japan, Korea, RMI, Tokelau, Chinese Taipei and USA to work with the Chair on drafting."
WCPFC12,308,"Japan made a statement indicating its faithful implementation of all the tropical tuna measures; its longline catch of bigeye tuna had decreased from 29,248 mt in 2004 to 14,555 mt in 2014, a reduction of 50%. The number of FAD sets was reduced from 3,162 in 2004 to 1,031 in 2014, a reduction of 67%. Nonetheless Japan observed the total number of FADs used in the entire WCPO increased from 10,768 in 2010 to 16,143 in 2014, an increase of 60%. Hence those CMMs did not achieve the objective of fishing mortality reduction, and instead invited further decline of tropical tuna stocks. Japan described the plight in fishing communities of Japan which rely on the migration of stocks to the area due to this failure of conservation efforts. Japan noted the abundance decline of those stocks was acutely affecting coastal fishing in Japan because it is located in the peripheral part of those stocks. Namely spring skipjack “Hatsugatuo”, which is migrating to the western part of Japan every spring historically famed for notifying the start of spring, but it has disappeared.  The catch of another historically famed fish, bigeye caught in autumn off Sanriku coast has declined drastically. As a result, the coastal skipjack pole and line fishery has had to revert its target to albacore in a substantial part of the year, and the coastal tuna longline fishery had to change its target from bigeye to swordfish and blue shark. Fortunately, the conditions of those alternate stocks happened to be favourable, but the number of coastal fishers decreased from 396 to 287 in the last 10 years. More severe blow hit the artisanal fisheries in the Japanese coastal communities, many of which are experiencing the danger of extinction. In 2008, Japan was looking forward to sufficient conservation benefit from high seas pocket closure, 3 months FAD closure and the Vessel Day scheme for reduction of fishing mortality by purse seiners. But they did not bring about the expected benefit. In CMM 2013-01, Japan again expected the same conservation benefit but the effectiveness of it turned out to be insufficient. The number of FADs used in WCPO is continuously increasing. The longline fishing mortality for bigeye did not increase since 2013 because of the exemption of the CMM. Under these circumstances, Japan came to this meeting with determination to take further sacrifice, if necessary, for its large scale fleet and work out better conservation measures to close loopholes. Japan stated it will continue to work with other CCMs for this purpose."
WCPFC12,309,The Chair thanked Japan for its commitment to keep working on this issue.
WCPFC12,310,"On 8 December, Tuvalu gave an update on WCPFC12-2015-DP06. A third revised version had been posted, and was now a joint FFA/Japan proposal for a TRP for skipjack, thanking Japan for its efforts to finding a drafting solution."
WCPFC12,311,Japan stated that local depletion is a serious issue and the Japanese coastal fishermen were suffering from poor skipjack migration to the Japanese coast and expressed appreciation to FFA members for accommodating Japan’s idea. Japan noted that it showed maximum flexibility in order to prevent deterioration of the stock and requested other CCMs to understand the situation that poor skipjack migration to Japanese coast was a very political issue in Japan.
WCPFC12,312,"Guam made some comments on the proposed TRP for skipjack, a stock which is especially important for SIDS. Guam noted that it does not have a large industrial scale fishery for skipjack, but its WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)45  small scale coastal troll fishery is highly dependent on the stock, forming about 63% of pelagic fish landings, which was also the case for CNMI. Guam noted that its waters are immediately adjacent to the world’s largest purse-seine skipjack tuna fishery, which has seen a year-on-year increase in volume of harvest. Guam’s local fishermen are convinced that both skipjack and yellowfin have become much scarcer as the purse-seine fishery skipjack catch has increased. This CCM noted the concerns expressed by Japan about the scarcity of skipjack in its waters and the possible reduction in local availability of the resource, observing that these same skipjack travel past Guam/CNMI to get to Japan. Guam noted that this has important implications for its food security and fishing culture."
WCPFC12,313,"The CNMI broadly supported the TRP for skipjack, with skipjack the principal commercial fish landed in the CNMI, accounting for over 60% of pelagic fish landings. CNMI noted that it did not have a large scale industrial tuna fishery but relies on coastal troll fishing. It did benefit in the late 1980s from a Guam-based purse-seine operation which had a cold store and transshipment facility on Tinian, and fished to the south of the Mariana Islands. CNMI noted SPC studies that indicate that the US EEZ around the Mariana Archipelago contains a considerable skipjack resource, with an average spawning biomass in excess of 80,000 metric tonnes. It was noted that in the 1930s, Japanese pole and line vessels operating used to catch up to 3,700 metric tonnes, which was over ten times the current combined annual catches from Guam and CNMI. The CNMI has a narrow economic base and sees fisheries as an area that could be expanded, and are interested in implications for their fisheries development in the CNMI from the skipjack TRP and request further evaluation of the spatial impacts to the skipjack resource."
WCPFC12,314,The Commission adopted CMM 2015-06 establishing a TRP for skipjack tuna (Attachment G)
WCPFC12,315,"On 8 December, the Chair gave an update on the HOD+1 discussion which had taken place that morning. These heads of delegation and technical experts met in the spirit of compromise. The Chair noted that there has been an important exchange of views amongst the members that increased understanding of the issues. The Chair noted that while agreement on the draft was not reached, there was willingness to continue having these discussions after the conclusion of WCPFC12. The Chair thanked participants, especially those who had helped with drafting the night before – Cook Islands, FSM, Japan, Korea, RMI, Tokelau, Chinese Taipei and USA. These CCMs were especially constructive in getting text on the table for other members to consider. In light of the outcome on CMM 2014-01, the Chair commented that the Commission needs to take a hard look at the approach the Commission takes to reaching agreement – that is, the consensus approach. At a time when the stakes are getting higher each year, the Chair commented that the Commission needs to examine whether it is conducting discussions in the best way to achieve outcomes. The Chair urged members to take that hard look after this meeting, in order to come back next year in a better position to make progress for the people members are representing when they come here."
WCPFC12,316,A number of participants made statements about the outcomes on the tropical tuna measure.
WCPFC12,317,"PNA members and Tokelau expressed their disappointment with the outcome on their proposed revisions to CMM 2014-01. These members stated that they had been prepared to go beyond the proposals, in response to the advice from SPC. These CCMs noted that the failure to improve measures to conserve and manage tropical tunas, especially bigeye, undermined the sustainable development opportunities of their people. PNA members stated that they will be working through 2016 to implement FAD charging and FAD tracking, the longline VDS, continued strengthening of the purse-seine VDS, and work on harvest strategies. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)46"
WCPFC12,318,"Japan also expressed disappointment in the outcome this year, reiterating its statement from the day earlier about its implementation of the measures and reductions in catch and FAD numbers; the number of FADs used in WCPO is continuously increasing and the longline fishing mortality for bigeye did not decrease since 2013 because of the exemption of the CMM. Japan was disappointed to find the stalemate caused by the crush between the interest of the industrialised fishing fleet of each party and the right of fishing development of SIDS. Japan also stated that it did not enjoy any exemption of the relevant CMM, and continued to faithfully implement the current measure."
WCPFC12,319,"American Samoa stressed that its economy is highly dependent on the tuna fishery, with two high volume canneries that employ over half of the local private sector work force. In addition, American Samoa has 20 locally-based large-scale purse seiners, about 20 local longliners, and support businesses such as the shipyard, net yards, fuel suppliers, maintenance and repair service providers and stevedoring companies. American Samoa benefits from US regulatory and enforcement resources to ensure compliance with Commission decisions. For American Samoa-based purse-seine vessels, the high seas areas close to Pago Pago represent historical fishing grounds which, when they were closed in June this year, saw an immediate negative impact on American Samoa’s economy, with a 45% reduction in purse-seine port calls compared to the previous year. There have been negative impacts from American Samoa’s implementation of the US high seas purse seine limits in CMM 2014-01. This CCM raised this issue in the context of Article 30 of the Convention on the special requirement of developing states and territories and sought understanding on the importance of avoiding adverse impacts of high seas effort limits on them."
WCPFC12,320,"USA thanked the Chair for helping the Commission through these discussions and for bringing together those involved in these fisheries for private discussions. This CCM expressed its disappointment that the Commission did not agree a measure which advanced the Commission’s shared interests in better managing these tropical tunas and highlighted the need to begin planning for the development of a measure in 2016. USA offered its views on what types of information would be useful to the Commission as it takes on the challenge of developing this new measure – for the longline fisheries it is important that the Commission consider spatial management, noting that the burden of conservation should be distributed based on where it will have the greatest impact. This CCM considered that the Commission should consider spatial management approaches for longline fisheries, and direct the scientific services provider to conduct an evaluation, particularly with respect to bigeye tuna stock status, for review by SC12, of a variety of spatial management options. These include, but should not necessarily be limited to: • bigeye tuna catch limits that apply only between 10°S and 10°N, where bigeye tuna exploitation is greatest;  • separate bigeye tuna catch limits in each of the WCPFC stock assessment regions, determined by the estimated proportion of the total stock that is in each region; and • a combination of the two previous options or others as appropriate."
WCPFC12,321,"The USA also offered its views on the types of information that would be useful to support the Commission’s consideration of management approaches for purse-seine fisheries.  It was proposed that the scientific services provider be directed to further investigate individual purse-seine vessel dynamics and operational characteristics with respect to catches of bigeye tuna. It was expected that such investigations would complement the work presented at SC11, which showed that about 10% of all purse seine vessels are responsible for approximately 30% of the total bigeye purse seine catch. The science provider should study what these top bigeye-catching purse seine vessels are doing differently, with the idea that a better understanding could help identify technical or other methods to mitigate bigeye mortality in purse seine fisheries. To support improvement of the tropical tunas measure as a whole, USA also requested that the scientific services provider be directed to prepare, as it has done for past meetings, tables of the expected consequences of various combinations of FAD set limits and longline bigeye catch WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)47  limits. The USA opined that this would help the Commission choose a combination of measures that not only achieves the objective, but does so in a fair manner. The information should include, for each scenario, measures of the relative fishery impact of the two sectors, including how their respective impacts change over time as the bigeye tuna stock rebuilds. USA commented that it was also important to ensure compliance with the measures in place, sharing others’ concerns that the measures are being disparately implemented and the Commission is not seeing the expected actions, such as closing fisheries and bringing enforcement actions. This CCM was looking to ensure measures adopted in the future are effective, and achieving the objectives for which they are were adopted."
WCPFC12,322,"Korea thanked CCMs for their cooperation and efforts but, despite this effort, the Commission had not reached an agreement on a new tropical tuna measure. This CCM noted that since 2013, the longline sector has been subject to catch limits and vessel number restrictions and strengthened MCS, while the purse-seine measure has stayed the same since 2014, and the status quo will continue to 2016. Korea noted that the effectiveness of CMM 2014-01 is subject to review every year but questioned whether the effectiveness can be evaluated when all relevant components have not been fully implemented, and the problem may lie in implementation. Korea noted that FADs greatly impact bigeye, and urged the Commission to strengthen FAD measures to reduce juvenile bigeye mortality, so they can grow into recruitment and spawning stocks, creating a positive feedback loop for stock rebuilding. Korea stated that, to this end, the longline sector was doing its part and complying with hard catch limits. In the SWG, Korea had suggested strengthening MCS on longliners, such as increasing polling rates and flexibility in gradual increase of observer coverage. Korea committed to working with all CCMs to find a constructive solution for tropical tuna management, including FAD-related issues, and hoped that before the next meeting CCMs can identify inherent problems in the current measure and its implementation, and focus on finding solutions based on clear scientific advice."
WCPFC12,323,"PNG thanked the Chair for her work and representations during the SWG, and agreed with Korea that implementation was part of the problem. In response to the USA’s comments, PNG commented that spatial management could be a topic of discussion for the high seas areas, but this will not supersede national laws."
WCPFC12,324,"EU expressed disappointment, seeing the Chair’s draft as a balanced one which would have strengthened management. EU supported the USA’s comments on the importance of particular research that might provide useful information to inform future discussions and options to guide the Commission’s discussions, noting that some of the elements were already available in the work SPC was doing, the harvest strategy workplan, and the research plan through the FADMgmtOptions-IWG. However, EU noted that without political will the Commission will not be able to address the problem."
WCPFC12,325,"Cooks joined the other CCMs in acknowledging the Chair’s work. This CCM stated that its preference would have been to accommodate a zone-based FAD limit, and reiterated its concern about allowing states the choice of FAD measures undermines their sovereign rights to adopt measures beyond those of coastal states."
WCPFC12,326,"The IATTC Executive Secretary Dr Compeán read a statement on behalf of Guillermo Morán, the IATTC Chairman. The IATTC Chairman considered that the time had come to take steps towards establishing joint management strategies for the shared tuna populations. The IATTC Chairman’s letter outlined the most effective management actions adopted to date in IATTC, and asked WCPFC12 to consider a) strengthening scientific cooperation, b) identifying differences in characteristics and structure of purse-seine operation and stock dynamics in the central and western Pacific and eastern Pacific, c) developing management measures such as a total closure of catches for the purse-seine fishery for skipjack, bigeye and yellowfin tunas, with the number and timing of days of closure based on the best available science, and d) developing a coordinated rebuilding and management plan for Pacific bluefin WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)48  tuna. On this, IATTC will ask WCPFC for a joint meeting with all interested parties after the 2016 ISC stock assessment, in order to adopt equivalent reference points."
WCPFC12,327,"RMI commended the Chair and Executive Director for their efforts from the outset, starting early in the year. RMI noted that a TRP for skipjack was agreed but on tropical tuna there was a sense of déjà vu from where the Commission left off in Apia. The PNA proposal was not agreed in Apia, on the grounds that members needed more time; this was resubmitted and was not agreed in Bali. RMI asked what the value of SIDS participation in WCPFC was, with their aspirations to develop their economies around the only resource they have. RMI noted that it will go away and do work internally."
WCPFC12,328,"The Organisation for the Promotion of Responsible Tuna Fisheries (OPRT) was disappointed that WCPFC12 had not come up with effective measures especially a decrease in the catch of bigeye tuna. This observer organization noted that the WCPO bigeye tuna is overfished, and the Commission has received a series of pieces of scientific advice on this issue. For the longline fishery, 6 CCMs with specific annual quotas reduced their bigeye tuna catches in accordance with relevant provisions 2013-01 and 2014-01. However, OPRT looked forward to further effective actions to be taken by the purse-seine fleet."
WCPFC12,329,"The Commission agreed to amend CMM 2014-01 to i) replace references to “2015” with “2016” in paragraphs 25, 28, 29, and 43 and ii) include reference to CMM 2014-01, in paragraph 62, Attachment C para 1 and 9, and Attachment E preamble (Attachment H, CMM 2015-01). AGENDA ITEM 10 – REVIEW OF CMM 2010-05 (SOUTH PACIFIC ALBACORE)  10.1 General overview of the status of the stock (South Pacific albacore)"
WCPFC12,330,"G. Pilling (SPC-OFP) presented a compendium of fishery indicators for south Pacific albacore tuna, including: total catch; catch by gear; and longline effort and nominal longline CPUE trends, along with their spatial patterns (WCPFC12-2015-14). The status of the south Pacific albacore stock from the most recent (2015) assessment was summarised and the potential stock consequences of recent fishing patterns relative to the agreed biomass limit reference point examined, using stochastic stock projections and incorporating the recommendations on inclusion of uncertainty from SC9. Based upon the 2015 stock assessment, and the level of uncertainty included within the projection analysis, there is a 20% chance that the south Pacific albacore stock will fall below the Limit Reference Point by 2033 under recent fishing effort levels. Overall average decreases in vulnerable biomass (a CPUE proxy) of 14% in longline fisheries were also estimated."
WCPFC12,331,"Chinese Taipei asked about the rationale, noting the condition of the stock is that albacore is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. This CCM also commented that the new stock assessment used different assumptions and the result was very different from the past three assessments. For example, a similar level was suggested for potential depletion of spawning stock biomass which was between 0.58 – 0.68 in the past three assessments but the new assessment using different assumptions suggested 0.4. This CCM expressed the concern of using projections based on this result to derive TRP."
WCPFC12,332,"Pilling explained that in the projections that were run, SPC assumed that future effort would remain constant at the 2013 level; as stock declines over time the catch would reduce. If the assumption was that the catch was constant, Pilling noted that the status of the stock would be even worse. Responding to Chinese Taipei’s question about the assessment for 2015, as agreed by SC, a value of 0.3 for natural mortality was used. This value is consistent with the value used for albacore in other areas of WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)49  the world. Pilling noted there were also high catches for the last five or six years, which would drive the stock to a lower state."
WCPFC12,333,"In response to Japan’s question about the geographical definition of the subtropical and tropical longline fisheries presented in the assessment report, Pilling clarified that using the spatial structure SPC used for this assessment, the region 10°S to 25°S represented the subtropical longline fleet."
WCPFC12,334,"Chinese Taipei asked whether the area showing an increase in catch was south of 20°S or north of 20°S. In response Pilling commented that the pattern of changes in catch was reasonably consistent with the pattern shown in the impact plot, and the increasing impact in the 10°S-25°S latitudinal band was related to increases in catch in this latitudinal region."
WCPFC12,335,"In response to the Cook Island’s query about the relative level of troll and longline fisheries, and how the study modelled their effort from 2013, Pilling noted that when running the status quo model, the stock was projected forward under 2013 levels in both the troll and longline fisheries. In contrast, the analysis presented to HSW on target reference points for south Pacific albacore adjusted levels of effort in the longline fishery only, keeping the troll fishery constant at 2013 levels."
WCPFC12,336,"After this general discussion, the Chair directed further discussions on the topic to be undertaken in the SWG. 10.2 Review of CMM 2010-05 Measure"
WCPFC12,337,"Recommendations from relevant WCPFC subsidiary bodies and intersessional working groups were presented to help facilitate a review by the Commission of the Conservation and Management Measure for South Pacific albacore (CMM 2010-05). For ease of consultation by the Commission, these recommendations were collated into a reference document (WCPFC12-2015-15).  It was also noted that the context for the recommendations could be found in the full body of each report."
WCPFC12,338,There were no comments on these two committees’ recommendations on South Pacific albacore.
WCPFC12,339,"The Chair noted that, as discussed earlier in the meeting, discussions within the SWG on South Pacific albacore should seek to draw a distinction between strengthening the measure for management purposes and assessing compliance. It was noted that the outcomes from the HSW would be posted when finalised for use in the SWG discussions as needed.  The outcomes from the HSW were discussed under agenda item 12.6 FFA proposal to establish a target reference point for South Pacific albacore"
WCPFC12,340,"FFA presented WCPFC12-2015-DP03_rev1, with three main purposes: set a TRP of 45% of the unfished biomass for south Pacific albacore; provide a reference to the existing LRP agreement; and establish that the acceptable risk of breaching this limit reference point will be 5% or less. FFA noted that it had settled on a TRP after considerable debate, and after due consideration of the alternatives analysed in bioeconomic models and industry views. The proposal aims to address the Commission priority to implement Article 6 of the Convention and establish the “best practice” management principles described in CMM 2014-06, and ensure viable south Pacific albacore fisheries. As these fisheries target only part of the size-range of the stock, they are only commercially viable when the stock biomass is considerably above the biomass that would produce MSY. Fishing the stock down to MSY would reduce longline catch rates below the level where they are profitable. According to the 2015 stock assessment, the stock biomass in 2013 was ~41% of what the biomass would be in the absence of fishing. These CCMs stated that, while moving the biomass indicator from 41% back to 45% does not sound significant, the stock is WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)50  on a downward trajectory and already requires a cut in total longline fishing catch by 37% over the course of a rebuilding program. FFA commented that if fishing efforts remains at current levels there is a 20% probability of breaching the LRP – not the “very low” risk required by Article 6 of the Convention. This proposal was discussed at the HSW where useful feedback was received. These CCMs noted that the text can be modified to reflect that the interim TRP will be the basis for analytical work towards a harvest strategy for the fishery but FFA members were not proposing to lock anything in, nor immediate catch and effort reductions."
WCPFC12,341,"In response to a question from one CCM about how the figures were generated, the FFA Secretariat noted that two detailed presentations were given at the HSW which spoke to the risk levels and demonstrated how 5% sits in relation to the agreed LRP, current stock status and the proposed TRP. A second presentation by FFA was made on the decision-making process used by FFA members to take SPC’s bio-economic assessment and come to the proposal for a 45% TRP."
WCPFC12,342,The Chair noted that discussions on the details could continue in the SWG.  FFA proposal to revise CMM 2010-05 to address the advice of SC11 and TCC11
WCPFC12,343,"Introducing WCPFC12-2015-DP04_rev1, FFA members noted that over the last decade they had made attempts to improve CMM 2010-05 to address the advice from their fishermen and SC10 and SC11 that longline fishing mortality and catch need to be reduced to avoid further decline in the vulnerable biomass so that economically viable catch rates can be maintained. The new stock assessment and increased catch over the past five years increases the urgency of those concerns; active management is needed and FFA commented that CMM 2010-05 is not capable of doing that job. Until a more effective measure is developed, the FFA proposal aims to help CMM 2010-05 fulfil its purpose which is ensure vessel numbers in this fishery do not increase above 2000-2004 or 2005 levels south of 20°S, noting that TCC has advised that the CMM in its current form is not capable of doing that. DP04 inserts data requirements into the CMM, providing two alternatives for decision by WCPFC – a) to expand the provision of summary data by CCMs for their vessels that take albacore south of 20°S or b) for those CCMs that do not already provide operational data to enter into or extend an agreement with SPC to make operational data available for the purposes of this CMM. Both make data available for annual analysis by the Secretariat that would enable the Commission to effectively assess the performance of the measure against its baselines. DP04 also inserts a new definition (“vessels actively fishing for south Pacific albacore”). FFA has consulted on this definition and the proposal was revised: FFA proposed that an actively fishing vessel be defined as a vessel which catches more than 5 tonnes of south Pacific albacore in a calendar year. These CCMs have kept amendments to a minimum as its aim is to address the TCC advice, not fix albacore management; they look to the harvest strategy process and the Tokelau Arrangement to do that. Lastly these CCMs noted that if CMM 2010-05 cannot be fixed it cannot be assessed and does not do anything."
WCPFC12,344,"New Caledonia spoke in support of the adoption of a TRP for South Pacific albacore, commenting that most of the waters below 20°S are on the high seas where there is poor observer coverage, weak enforcement and a lack of operational data from major longline fleets fishing there. This CCM comment that albacore mostly spawns between the equator and 20°S and there is more or less free access to this stock. While it is not overfished the uncertainty around it is high and the spawning biomass has been declining for years. This CCM looks to the Tokelau Arrangement, under which FFA members limit the catch of South Pacific albacore in their waters. New Caledonia has capped the number of vessels authorized to fish in its EEZ to 21 since 2011, all New Caledonia-owned longliners, with no licenses issued to foreign vessels for 15 years. New Caledonia’s fishing companies voluntarily adhere to a certification process based largely on compliance with domestic and international regulations. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)51"
WCPFC12,345,"The Chair noted that the SWG led by Australia to look at the South Pacific albacore CMM would cover the TRP proposal, the proposal to strengthen the existing measure and the element of the harvest strategy work plan covering albacore. The Chair urged delegates to keep in mind the TCC recommendations relating to the sub-committee’s inability to assess the measure’s performance and compliance against it.  Outcomes of south Pacific albacore CMM 2010-05 SWG discussions"
WCPFC12,346,"On 5 December Australia reported that the SWG had begun discussions on DP03, DP04 and the South Pacific albacore components of the harvest strategy work plan DP09. There was no consensus on a TRP (DP03), nor was there consensus on an acceptable level of risk for the LRP; this would require revisions to the albacore components of the harvest strategy work plan. There was general agreement on a preamble for DP04 but currently no consensus on the definition of ‘actively fishing’, however there were positive comments about supplying data."
WCPFC12,347,"Prior to the SWG meeting on 7 December, the Cook Islands made a statement in plenary, borne out of concern that polarised positions were emerging around critical measures and noting that it was time for individual states to step up. The Cooks Islands supported WCPFC adopting a meaningful harvest strategy as per the FFA Sustainable Fisheries Roadmap. This CCM’s intervention came with the support of the Cook Islands Prime Minister and recognised that the albacore longline fishery is an area in which the Cook Islands had individual influence. The Cook Islands was willing to offer a concession. In 2012 the Cook Islands accounted for 10,700 tonnes of albacore tuna, 15% of the total WCPFC catches. Its commitment to the FFA Tokelau Agreement was to reduce its catch to 9,600 tonnes. In light of the SC recommendation to reduce catches by 37% this CCM offered to work within the WCPFC harvest strategy to reduce catches further than that, to 35%, or a reduction of 4,000 tonnes, to 7,000 tonnes within two years. This concession to reduce catch was conditional on a phased reduction and eventual ban of longline fishing in the Eastern High Seas Pocket, noting that it would be prejudicial to the Cook Islands’ interests and FFA domestic fleets and coastal states’ fleets if the Cook Islands reduced catches in its zone while effort was to increase in the Eastern High Seas Pocket. The Cook Islands challenged members to work within the CMMs but also engage in open dialogue and apply commitments across the board, offering meaningful concessions at WCPFC12."
WCPFC12,348,"Australia reported that SWG met three times this week, with substantial participation and constructive engagement. However, no agreement was reached on an albacore TRP or the acceptable levels of risk of breaching the reference point. The SWG had some success on the data provision proposal. The proposal required submission of species catch data, by vessel, by year for 2006-2014 and earlier years where possible. The proposal was not to require vessel names to retain confidentiality; vessels would be identified as ‘Vessel 1’, ‘Vessel 2’, etcetera."
WCPFC12,349,"There were two small issues on the draft which were resolved in plenary – USA wanted to restore some language around the number and catch of albacore from all vessels which had been deleted in the draft, and China asked for the deletion of ‘average’ from para. 1."
WCPFC12,350,"The Commission adopted CMM 2015-02 which will revise and replace CMM 2010-05 (Attachment I, CMM 2015-02)."
WCPFC12,351,Australia further reported that there was no consensus on establishing a TRP for albacore.
WCPFC12,352,"American Samoa expressed frustration at the lack of progress to strengthen the conservation and management of South Pacific albacore, on which American Samoa’s longline fishery is almost entirely WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)52  dependent. This CCM’s domestic longline fishery had gone through great changes in the last ten years, going from feast to famine, noting that ten years ago, the fishery was in good shape but recently, the economics of the fishery became so poor that operators had to tie up. In the same time period American Samoa has lost its small scale albacore fishery, and this CCM recognised that its South Pacific neighbours have experienced similar downturns in their fisheries. American Samoa supported Commission measures that improve economic and resource conditions for the South Pacific longline fleets, and expressed concerns about the potential impact of on the supply of albacore to our local canneries in American Samoa of measures which had been proposed. American Samoa’s tuna industry preceded the Commission’s existence by many decades, and our economy is completely dependent on tuna processing. This CCM supported continued efforts to identify an albacore TRP through the harvest strategy process that leads to improved catch rates while minimizing impacts on the local processing facilities of SIDS and Participating Territories."
WCPFC12,353,"FFA members registered their disappointment that WCPFC12 did not secure a TRP for the albacore fishery. An albacore TRP was discussed at the last two MOWs and the HSW prior to WCPFC12. These CCMs advised CCMs that if they expect consensus or compromise, a credible proposal has to be provided. FFA members stated that South Pacific coastal states will continue to develop collaborative zone-based management arrangements and while they preferred to develop them within overall limits of a Commission-wide TRP, in its absence these CCMs will finalise the establishment of their own management system for fisheries within their EEZs, including the use of an interim TRP. It was noted that three-quarters of the albacore catch is taken within EEZs."
WCPFC12,354,The Cook Islands reiterated that it was prepared to make significant cuts but with a commensurate reduction in effort in adjacent areas. CCMs could consider including in their vessel licencing conditions measures on the high seas that can accompany the Cook Islands cuts.
WCPFC12,355,"New Zealand supported the Cook Islands and FFA statements, noting that a TRP was a priority for New Zealand this year. Over the next year, this CCM wanted other members to become more engaged, especially with the analysis done by SPC, which clearly illustrates that current catch levels are not sustainable. AGENDA ITEM 11 – BYCATCH MITIGATION (SHARKS, SEABIRDS, TURTLES,  WHALE SHARKS, CETACEANS)"
WCPFC12,356,Recommendations from relevant subsidiary bodies and intersessional working groups were considered by the Commission to facilitate the review of the selected bycatch mitigation CMMs with the objective of refining and improving their effectiveness. The Commission reviewed three specific CMMs and three proposals under this agenda item. It was noted that there no stock status overviews for the bycatch stocks concerned. The SC and TCC recommendations were contained in WCPFC12-2015-16 for easy reference.
WCPFC12,357,The Chair asked CCMs if there were any issues with the SC11 and TCC11 recommendations on any of the shark species (WCPFC12-2015-16). No general comments or concerns were raised. 11.1 CMM 2010-07 and CMM 2014-05 (Sharks)
WCPFC12,358,The Commission reviewed the two Conservation and Management Measures for sharks (CMM 2010-07 and CMM 2014-05). WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)53  EU proposal for Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks
WCPFC12,359,"With WCPFC12-2015-DP16, EU introduced it proposal to amend CMM 2010-07, to implement a ‘fins attached’ policy. EU commented that this year was the first time the Commission had received two strong recommendations from both sub-committees and noted in particular that SC11 had discussed the issue extensively and had reviewed research and data provided by one CCM which was implementing the fin-to-carcass ratio – research which demonstrated that despite the best efforts and goodwill of this CCM to perform this analysis as scientifically as possible several important shortcomings have been identified. SC11 had made a clear recommendation (SC11 Summary Report para. 553) following this review. EU noted that TCC11 had also made a strong recommendation (TCC11 Summary Report para. 462) relating to the inability to assess compliance with the enforcement of the fin-to-carcass weight ratio as means for implementing the finning ban in the WCPFC CA. This CCM stated that the subsidiary bodies of the Commission had made these recommendations and they cannot be ignored, particularly when the Commission receives observer reports that demonstrate that finning is still occurring. The EU offered to discuss the proposal with interested parties in the margins."
WCPFC12,360,"EU also took the opportunity to speak to CMM 2014-05, noting that the CMM which was adopted last year included shark management plans. While this was considered progress towards the management of sharks, SC11 had looked at the submitted management plans and raised concerns that there were not clear guidelines about what elements these plans should include and had asked the Commission for guidance on how to build these plans. EU expressed the view that WCPFC12 needed to give this guidance to the SC and TCC so they are able to do their work and have effective management plans in place. The EU also hoped to discuss this issue with interested parties."
WCPFC12,361,"FFA members supported the intention of the EU proposal to strengthen existing CMMs for sharks, ensure full utilisation of sharks that are landed and contribute to decreased mortality. FFA members tabled a comprehensive revision to the shark measure at WCPFC11 which included a prohibition on finning, with a narrowly defined exception. These members would discuss this further with the EU. FFA members hoped to see a consolidation of existing shark CMMs, particularly CMM2010-07 and 2014-05, and took the view that the EU proposal would be best incorporated into the main shark measure rather than be a stand-alone measure."
WCPFC12,362,The Chair noted that the Commission has five shark-related CMMs and asked that WCPFC12 consider consolidating them so that they become a little more user-friendly and easier to access.
WCPFC12,363,"Fiji noted that shark fins ratio were discussed at length at SC, which had come to the view that data on fin-to-carcass ratios was not available and came up with a Shark Research Plan for directed research which also includes further Monte Carlo simulation work."
WCPFC12,364,"USA expressed strong support for the EU proposal and supported the idea to combine the measures, making them more user-friendly and coherent. The USA would be happy to engage in this work. NC had made a recommendation to both SC and ISC that they work together to determine whether North Pacific blue shark is a northern stock. The SC had simply noted that the ISC had provided information, but SC had not taken action. The USA considered it important for the SC to commit to doing that work, and to that end wanted the Commission to convey to the SC the importance of making a recommendation on this stock. In the view of this delegation it was in the purview of the NC, and North Pacific blue shark was a stock that needs to be managed. USA wanted the record to reflect a decision to instruct the SC to move that forward. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)54"
WCPFC12,365,"Japan followed up the USA comment on blue shark, noting that on 4 December 2015 the NC would meet and would hopefully adopt the recommendation in the NC meeting report.  This matter was discussed under Agenda 12.2."
WCPFC12,366,"SPREP endorsed EU’s views on shark bycatch and welcomed the trend towards increasing collaboration with other organisations to address bycatch issues. This is exemplified in the ABNJ project work which Dr Shelley Clarke was leading. SPREP noted that it is not primarily a research agency, but it is engaged in advocacy initiatives regarding sharks, especially through the Convention on Migratory Species and the Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna, and extend to other threatened and migratory species. SPREP commented that by-catch is clearly a significant problem affecting many threatened and migratory species, and welcomed the opportunity to discuss these issues with the Secretariat and others during WCPFC12, and collaborate with fellow CROP agencies, FFA and SPC, to make a substantive contribution to the mitigation of turtle bycatch."
WCPFC12,367," Japan noted that WCPFC11 had adopted a measure which requires the development of a management plan for longline fisheries that target sharks; Japan and Chinese Taipei had developed management plans and submitted them to SC11. Japan stated that to develop the plan the government had held meetings with fresh longline fleet fishermen based at Kesennuma fishing port many times and that the plan included the requirement for fins to be naturally attached, a catch limit and restrictions on catching small-sized sharks. Japan took the view that it was an appropriate plan for the conservation and management of sharks and would be implemented from 2016."
WCPFC12,368,A number of CCMs noted that SC had clearly asked for guidance on the management plans.
WCPFC12,369,The Chair noted that there were two clear recommendations from SC and TCC which confirm that these subcommittees had not been able to progress CMM 2014-05 in any real way. SC had found it difficult to evaluate these plans and TCC had concurred; the Commission needed to develop the guidelines required. It was noted that there was not a set of minimum guidelines drafted. The Chair suggested either creating a small group to do that drafting during WCPFC12 or work through the sub-committees to provide those guidelines for the Commission to adopt in 2016.
WCPFC12,370,"EU wanted a clear recommendation from WCPFC12 on this matter. It was noted that Dr Shelley Clarke, who was currently attached to the Commission, was an expert in sharks and bycatch and suggested she could start preparing an ideal management plan document which could be discussed and revised as appropriate at SC12 and TCC12 for adoption and future implementation by CCMs."
WCPFC12,371,A number of CCMs suggested that the Secretariat develop the initial draft to go to SC and TCC.
WCPFC12,372,USA commented that it would be useful to discuss this in a small working group to develop some instructions for the Secretariat.
WCPFC12,373,Japan supported the idea of developing a draft guideline to evaluate a management plan for future review but stressed that it was implementing its management plan from 2016 in order to contribute to management of sharks.
WCPFC12,374,"The Chair noted the consensus for a small group to meet and develop a recommendation that sets out what the Commission would be tasking the Secretariat to produce for SC and TCC, to bring back to WCPFC13. EU would lead that small group, with work on CMM 2010-07 continuing in the margins of WCPFC12. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)55"
WCPFC12,375,"On 5 December, EU reported that the informal group discussing shark issues had met on 4 December. EU had received comments on its proposal to implement a fins naturally attached policy in CMM 2010-07. EU reported that there was an attempt to try and consolidate CMM 2010-07 with CMM 2014-05 but it had not proved possible at this time. The informal group also discussed the development of guidelines for CCMs that target sharks in association with WCPFC fisheries and are required to develop a management plan for that fishery. A document had been drafted and distributed to delegates. Later on 5 December, EU noted that a revised version of the fins naturally attached amendment had been posted and the group would meet again on 7 December."
WCPFC12,376,"On 8 December, EU updated the Commission on those discussions, noting that it had received comments on the draft and the necessary support for proposal had not been received. It was noted that this was not the first year the EU had introduced a fins naturally attached proposal, and recalled that the 5% fin-to-carcass ratio has been recognised by TCC and SC as impossible to monitor. EU suggested text for a recommendation, noting that it was not EU’s preferred option but was a way forward, to recognise the impasse and conclusions reached by TCC and SC and help the Commission move forward and prepare the debate for next year, to provide an effective measure which can be monitored and controlled and which serves its purpose."
WCPFC12,377,A lengthy discussion took place on the draft text.
WCPFC12,378,"USA expressed appreciation for the efforts of the EU in trying to deal with this issue, and noted that the fins naturally attached provisions were supported by many around the table. However, this CCM had concerns with paras. 1 and 2."
WCPFC12,379,EU noted that it had encouraged comments from delegations during the meeting and there was consensus on the language at the informal group.
WCPFC12,380,"Japan, China and Indonesia had queries about the format, and whether it was meant to be a CMM or a recommendation, and on some of the language used."
WCPFC12,381,"WWF, Shark Advocates International, Humane Society International, Greenpeace, International Seafood Sustainability Foundation, Sustainable Fisheries Partnership, MDPI, Earth Island Institute, Conservation International, The Pew Charitable Trusts, International Pole and Line Foundation, and Birdlife International expressed their support for the development of guidelines to improve management plans for targeted shark fisheries to ensuring that existing measures are enforceable, and that the waste and risk associated with shark finning is eliminated. These observer organisations opined that the only way to guarantee that sharks have not been finned is to require that carcasses be landed with the fins naturally attached. It was noted that the Marine Stewardship Council considers fins naturally attached as the only compliance standard that can provide certainty, and prohibiting at-sea shark fin removal can facilitate improved data on shark catches. It was noted that the fins naturally attached approach is mandated in a growing number of countries and is gaining acceptance in international arenas, referencing a similar proposal was co-sponsored by 30 ICCAT parties recently. These organisations expressed frustration that WCPFC has not adopted this best practice for preventing shark finning, and reiterated their request that such action is taken as soon as possible."
WCPFC12,382,Fiji reminded CCMs the shark research plan adopted during the last SC still stands.
WCPFC12,383,"EU expressed its disappointment that the proposal had not been accepted, noting that only one part of the language was additional beyond what TCC already noted. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)56"
WCPFC12,384,"On 8 December, EU reported back to plenary on its proposal to provide guidance for the elaboration and evaluation of management plans for target shark fisheries (WCPFC12-2015-DP26). A revision had been posted, and EU noted the very constructive work which had taken place at the informal group. It was noted that the rationale was to give guidance for the development of management plans that are foreseen in CMM 2014-05, and the guidance is based on that rationale. According to the draft terms of reference for the development of guidelines, management plans should be based on Article 5 of the Convention and para. 2 of CMM 2014-05, taking into account advice from SC and TCC. The Secretariat is directed to propose a range of possible definitions of a longline fishery targeting key shark species in association with WCPFC fisheries, for the consideration of SC12 and TCC12. EU noted that this was not a CMM, just guidance for a process to be undertaken in 2016."
WCPFC12,385,"Australia supported the text, and noted that it was supported by consensus in the informal group."
WCPFC12,386,"Japan suggested that “shall” be amended to “should”, reflecting that they are guidelines. Japan noted that, with this amendment, it will go along with the guidelines to be used when developing its next management plan in the future."
WCPFC12,387,China and Chinese Taipei supported the draft guidelines with the amendment proposed by Japan.
WCPFC12,388,The Commission tasks the Secretariat to develop a paper that provides guidance on the development and evaluation of management plans for longline fisheries targeting sharks in association with WCPFC fisheries (CMM 2014-05) and which takes into account the elements and timeframes contained in Attachment J). 11.2 CMM 2012-04 (Whale Sharks)
WCPFC12,389,The Commission discussed the Conservation and Management Measure on the protection of whale sharks from purse-seine operations (CMM 2012-04) and guidelines which had been developed for the safe release of encircled animals.
WCPFC12,390,It was noted that the guidelines were finalised at SC11 and put forward for TCC’s consideration and for the Commission for adoption. Many CCMs expressed support for the adoption of the guidelines.
WCPFC12,391,"FFA members noted that there was nothing in place for the safe release of whale sharks, and commented that the guidelines can be updated as new research on their practical application becomes available. These CCMs’ support recognised that application of the guidelines was non-binding and did not supersede the specific national laws that some CCMs have in place on this matter. In addition, FFA members endorsed TCC11 recommendations on the ongoing development by SC of more comprehensive guidelines pertaining to the safe release of sharks and rays, and other animals important to coastal States."
WCPFC12,392,"USA suggested that the Commission also consider transitioning some of the guidelines to enforceable requirements, based on additional research confirming the guidelines are the appropriate way to safely release whale sharks. This CCM suggested that something be put in place to ensure the necessary research is undertaken to determine if the guidelines are the best methods for the Commission to then convert into measures and requirements."
WCPFC12,393,"EU suggested that research could continue and new, better methods could be found but until then the guidelines could be adopted as minimum standards."
WCPFC12,394,WCPFC12 endorsed the “Guidelines for Safe Release of Encircled Animals including whale WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)57  sharks” as recommended by SC11 and TCC11 as contained in Attachment K. 11.3 CMM 2012-07 (Seabirds) Japan proposal to revise CMM 2012-07 to mitigate the impact of fishing for highly migratory fish stocks on seabirds
WCPFC12,395,"Japan introduced a proposal for seabird mitigation (WCPFC12-2015-DP02a/WCPFC12-2015-DP02b) which would require small scale vessels (less than 24 metres in length) conducting longline fishing activities in the area north of 23°N in the WCPFC area to employ a seabird mitigation measure. Japan noted that in the past three years it had undertaken research on mitigation measure for small scale longline vessels operating in this area and the proposal was based on that research. Those vessels would be required to use at least one seabird mitigation measures in the area north of 23°N. In addition, a specification for a short streamer to be used for small scale fishing vessels was introduced. Japan stressed the importance of fishermen’s safety on board the small scale fishing vessels, and noted that small scale Japanese longline fishing vessels are thinner in shape than other members’ vessels, giving them different vulnerabilities, specifically when using streamers."
WCPFC12,396,Chinese Taipei noted that a number of its flagged small scale vessels fish in this area of the WCPO and supported the proposal as a first step to moving forward.
WCPFC12,397,USA considered the proposal an important step towards eliminating the exemption for small vessels in the North Pacific. This CCM had considered the results of the research Japan had presented to SC11 and remained concerned that there was insufficient evidence of the efficacy of Japan’s proposed tori line design. This CCM would like some work to be done comparing the proposed design with mitigation required for other vessels to generate more substantive evidence that it is effective before its adoption by the Commission.
WCPFC12,398,Australia echoed USA’s comments and asked Japan to elaborate on the scientific evidence that demonstrates adequate mitigation from the use of only one mitigation measure from the entire Table 1 of CMM 2012-07.
WCPFC12,399,"ACAP welcomed Japan’s research on seabird bycatch mitigation in the North Pacific, and noted that this research shows conclusively that there is a high seabird attack rate on small scale longline vessels in the North Pacific, with 70 attacks per 1000 hooks when no mitigation was used and the number of birds caught extremely high. ACAP commented that this demonstrates the importance of using mitigation measures in this area. ACAP requested that this research be presented to the next meeting of the ACAP Seabird Bycatch Working Group so the effectiveness of the proposed tori line design can be evaluated for possible inclusion in ACAP's Best Practice Advice. Regarding the proposed amendment to CCM 2012-07, providing that small vessels in the North Pacific use one of the mitigation measures in Table 1, ACAP noted that only those mitigation measures in column A of Table 1 had been shown conclusively to be effective in reducing seabird bycatch. While ACAP’s best practice advice is that all three measures in Column A should be used in combination, choosing just one measure from Column A of table one would still reduce the number of seabirds caught. ACAP recommended that the Japanese proposal be amended to require the choice of one measure from Column A, rather than one measure from Table 1."
WCPFC12,400,Japan noted that its scientific data was presented to past SC meetings and stressed that the proposal is its best effort at this stage. This CCM stated that it did not want the excuse of not having enough evidence to delay introducing measures. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)58
WCPFC12,401,The Chair noted that the Commission needed to work in the margins on the proposal and asked interested parties to work with Japan before bringing it back to plenary.
WCPFC12,402,"Japan reported back on discussions on its proposal (WCPFC12-2015-DP02). Japan advised that it had met with other members and NGOs and a revised version had been posted. The important change was that previously fishers could choose at least a mitigation method from Column A or B, but in the revised version, only those methods in Column A are available for small scale fishing vessels while number of method required to implement is the same. Japan received comments on the short streamer specifications. Japan noted the difficulties for small scale longline vessels employing a short streamer as specified in CMM 2012-07 because trial implementation of that method on a small longline vessel in the North Pacific ocean caused entanglement of fishing gear during line setting and that safety issues were something on which they could not compromise, and hoped the revised version could be adopted. Japan advised that the similar research as the last three years will continue and the results will be reported to SC. There may be a possibility to review the proposed measure in the future, based on the outcome of the future research."
WCPFC12,403,"USA continued to have concerns about the efficacy of the proposed tori line design, noting Japan’s continued intent to study it, and wanted to put a time constraint in place. USA wanted to provide an opportunity for the efficacy to be evaluated, after which the Commission could make a decision on whether to extend the use of the alternative tori lines. USA noted that the SC had concerns about whether the research supported the claim that it was as efficacious as other measures."
WCPFC12,404,"Japan and USA agreed to talk in the margins about how long the period should be before the measure was reviewed, whether two or three years from the effective date. Japan noted it was conducting the research every year and a two-year timeframe only gave one year of result. On 8 December, Japan and USA advised that they had agreed on language."
WCPFC12,405,"The Commission adopted CMM 2015-03 which will revise and replace CMM 2012-07 (Attachment L, CMM 2015-03). FFA proposal to revise CMM 2012-07 (seabirds)"
WCPFC12,406,"FFA members presented WCPFC12-2015-DP11, to amend CMM 2012-07. The proposal included minor amendments that seek to shift the latitudinal line from 30°S to 25°S, excluding EEZs other than Australia and New Zealand that extend south of 25°S. Referring to SC papers including the latest, SC11-EB-WP-09, FFA members noted the increasing rate of seabird interactions in areas north of 30°S in the Commission area over the years. It was noted that the SC11 meeting record made reference to the ongoing problem of relatively low observer coverage and missing logsheets for longline vessels. For FFA members, this suggests that seabird interactions have not been properly documented and are therefore probably higher than currently reported."
WCPFC12,407,"China noted after the presentation that it had some queries on the proposal: firstly the amendment text did not relate to the preamble, and asked New Zealand to update that section and highlight the rationale behind the change in area. This CCM noted that it could not accept the exclusion of the southern countries’ EEZ from the operation of the measure."
WCPFC12,408,"USA supported the idea of moving the line further north but expressed concerns about the differential treatment of EEZs and the high seas, a distinction that may not be supported scientifically. This CCM suggested further discussions about the FFA proposal, and suggested a slight move of the line could treat EEZs and high seas comparably and also protect seabirds. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)59"
WCPFC12,409,"Chinese Taipei expressed similar sentiments, and questioned the exception for vessels operating in the EEZs, noting that seabird mortality often happens close to land. This CCM asked for a scientific comment to address that query."
WCPFC12,410,"Fiji supports the FFA proposal introduced by New Zealand. Some of the seabirds interacting with longliners are endemic to some FFA members like one petrel species in Fiji. Therefore FFA members would want to see reduction in the risk to seabird bycatch by longliners in the overlap area between 30° S and 25° S, but excluding those Pacific Island EEZs that extended south of 25°S."
WCPFC12,411,The Chair suggested that the proponents address these questions or take them up in sideline discussions.
WCPFC12,412,"BirdLife welcomed the proposals put forward by FFA for the South Pacific and Japan for the north Pacific for improving the seabird bycatch measure. BirdLife noted that it has been working for two years to impress upon the Commission the risk posed to albatrosses from small vessels in the north Pacific and, more recently, the risk to vulnerable seabirds breeding in New Zealand such as black petrel and Antipodean albatross in the area between 25°-30°S which is not currently protected by seabird mitigation. This observer organization hoped to work cooperatively with FFA and Japan and other CCMs during WCPFC12 to bring an effective seabird measure to the Commission for endorsement."
WCPFC12,413, New Zealand advised that it would engage with other parties to address some of the issues raised during these discussions.
WCPFC12,414,"On 8 December, New Zealand advised that, following comments across the floor after its introduction, it had initiated meetings with other CCMs. These discussions reinforced that the exemptions which was the primary concern were quite significant for the member countries. New Zealand noted that exemptions applied in other areas in the context of seabirds, and advised that the proposal is not amended from what was initially proposed."
WCPFC12,415,China noted its difficulties with the initial proposal.
WCPFC12,416,The Chair noted that there was no consensus for adoption of the amendments.
WCPFC12,417,Birdlife hoped that the practical difficulties could be resolved over the coming year and that the proposal could be adopt at WCPFC13. 11.4  Others
WCPFC12,418,"No discussions took place under this agenda item.  AGENDA ITEM 12 – ADOPTION OF REPORTS FROM SUBSIDIARY BODIES, INTERSESSIONAL WORKING GROUPS AND OTHER WORKSHOPS"
WCPFC12,419,"Recommendations of WCPFC subsidiary bodies, intersessional working groups and workshops which were not discussed in earlier agenda items were presented under this agenda item as well as discussions on proposals which had not been discussed in any depth under other agenda items. The Chair noted that the species-specific recommendations were taken as accepted by the Commission.   WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)60  12.1 SC11"
WCPFC12,420,"On behalf of the SC Chair, A. Batibasaga (Fiji) presented key recommendations, other than species-related recommendations, of the 11th Regular Session of the Scientific Committee (WCPFC12-2015-17a and WCPFC12-2015-17b) held in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia, from 5- 13 August 2015,chaired by L. Kumoru (PNG). Among the SC recommendations in the SC11 Summary Report, A. Batibasaga asked for the Commission’s specific endorsement of those recommendations in his report as listed below.  SC11 Summary report 172. SC11 recommends that funding be continued to maintain the Project 35: Bigeye Biology and WCPFC Tuna Tissue Bank, with particular emphasis on WCPO bigeye, yellowfin, and skipjack tunas. SC11 also recommends that the Commission adopt the “WCPFC Tissue Bank Access Protocols” developed within Project 35 and modified by ISG-2 at SC11 (Attachment D)."
WCPFC12,421,"The presentation of the SC11 recommendation in paragraph 172 (Progress on Project 35) led to extensive procedural discussions. Because the budget had not been finalised as the FAC was still meeting in the margins of WCPFC12, a number of CCMs had concerns about accepting SC recommendations with budgetary implications, including CCMs which said it would be difficult for them to increase their contributions. It was generally agreed that recommendations with financial implications, if supported, are provisionally accepted.  In relation to SC11 recommendation paragraph 172, final approval on Project 35 recommendations would be subject to FAC’s final recommendations on the 2016 budget. SC11 Summary Report 612. SC11 adopts the Shark Research Plan and Stock Assessment Schedule (Attachment H) and recommends that WCPFC12 endorses it."
WCPFC12,422,"Regarding the SC11 decision on the stock assessment schedule in paragraph 612, there were also concerns from one CCM about the timing of stock assessments in the SC work plan, especially related with the skipjack assessment scheduled in 2016. A number of CCMs noted that the reasons for 2016 being chosen to do this assessment included the diminishing value of tuna tagging data, collection of which ended in 2013, and the fact that conducting three tuna stock assessments in one year presented an enormous workload burden for SPC."
WCPFC12,423,"WCPFC12 did not adopt the SC11 report during initial discussions on this agenda item, as a number of issues were not yet resolved. This included the timing of the stock assessments as had been recommended by SC11, and the prioritisation of those assessments, and budget approval for the projects recommended in the SC11 report. The Chair directed those with competing priorities for the timing of the stock assessments to consult in the margins and work out an appropriate schedule to enable the adoption of the SC11 summary report later in the meeting."
WCPFC12,424,"On 8 December, the discussions on this matter resumed."
WCPFC12,425,"Australia noted that skipjack, South Pacific blue shark and thresher shark were on the current schedule of assessments for 2016, and recalled that there was agreement in the informal meeting that the skipjack should be retained but there was an issue with the blue shark assessment: if this was 2017 rather than 2016, data from the EPO could be incorporated. Australia expressed the view that this would be a more efficient use of WCPFC resources and would result in a more comprehensive assessment, however the issue was not a major one for Australia and this CCM would not block consensus."
WCPFC12,426,"EU considered it important to maintain the stock assessment of South Pacific blue shark in 2016, noting the EU could facilitate contacts to obtain EPO information. EU reiterated that it would have preferred to postpone the 2016 skipjack stock assessment. With other CCMs proposing to defer the blue WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)61  shark stock assessment, EU suggested that a compromise would be to not change the assessment schedule recommended by SC11, but adopt it."
WCPFC12,427,"USA concurred with Australia’s comments, noting that in 2016 it will be a data poor fishery without the CPUE data. If it were postponed, the EPO and ABNJ information could be incorporated. The analysis would be more rigorous and more cost effective."
WCPFC12,428,"New Zealand echoed these views, noting the increased data in 2017. However, it noted as a matter of principle that the Commission should adopt the schedule of stock assessments coming out of SC and conduct the skipjack assessment and the blue shark assessment in 2016."
WCPFC12,429,"The Commission endorsed the SC11 recommended stock assessment schedule (Attachment M).  SC11 Summary Report paragraph 386.  SC11 recommends that the Secretariat develops a proposal to establish a formal process and its cost implication to independently review stock assessments. This proposal will be presented to SC12. SC11 Summary Report paragraph 390. Noting that SC10 had considered levels of risk associated with breaching the LRP within the range 5-20%, that the identification of acceptable risk is a management issue, SC11 reaffirmed the recommendation made by SC10 that WCPFC12 identify the level of acceptable risk which should be applied to breaching a LRP for the key target species, noting that the UN Fish Stocks Agreement states that the risk of exceeding LRPs should be very low."
WCPFC12,430,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat to develop a proposal, including an indicative budget, to establish a formal process to independently review stock assessments. This proposal will be presented to SC12."
WCPFC12,431,The Commission noted that SC10 had considered levels of risk associated with breaching the LRP within the range 5-20% and that the identification of acceptable risk is a management issue.
WCPFC12,432,"The Commission agreed to identify the level of acceptable risk which should be applied to breaching a LRP for the key target species, noting that the UN Fish Stocks Agreement states that the risk of exceeding LRPs should be very low."
WCPFC12,433,It was noted that discussions on the levels of risk were ongoing within the harvest strategy discussions taking place in the margins of WCPFC12.
WCPFC12,434,"It was agreed that the recommendation relating to the nomination of a SC Vice-Chair (SC11 Summary Report para. 699-700) would be endorsed under agenda item 17.3. Operational level data agreement to support WCPFC stock  SC11 Summary Report paragraph 225. After the discussion among the involved CCMs, it was reported that the CCMs needed domestic clearance before finally agreeing to a new arrangement. However, as a way of cooperation in response to the SC’s appreciation and request, those CCMs agreed not to require SPC to delete their operational data provided to SPC and the products thereof under the condition that they will not be used in any way until a new agreement is reached with SPC. Those CCMs will discuss the new arrangement intersessionally with SPC based on the draft text for WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)62  the Agreement for Provision of Operational-level Data to SPC to Support WCPFC Stock Assessments shown in Attachment E, with the intention of finalizing the arrangement prior to WCPFC12.  SC11 Summary Report paragraph 226. SC11 appreciated the cooperation and flexibility shown by those CCMs involved and expressed its hope that the new arrangement will be agreed among relevant CCMs promptly so that the SPC’s work can be maintained."
WCPFC12,435,"Regarding the new arrangement for the submission of operational level data in paragraph 226 of the SC11 summary report, SPC gave a progress report. J. Hampton noted that at the close of SC11 an agreement had been drafted on the continued submission and retention of operational data to be used in SPC stock assessments undertaken for WCPFC. The CCMs involved in that agreement (China, Japan, Korea, Japan, Chinese Taipei and USA) were going to revert to Capitals to check and come back with advice on whether the agreement was acceptable to those CCMs. Hampton noted that the draft was acceptable to the USA and Chinese Taipei but the other CCMs had not yet provided SPC with advice and hoped they would do so by the end of the meeting. If the agreement was acceptable to these CCMs, the data were due to be updated next year, to be provided by 30 April 2016."
WCPFC12,436,PNG noted the significance for FFA members of the provision of operational data from these states. This CCM asked whether the agreement covered historical data provided for the last assessment and asked for a status update from the CCMs which had not responded to SPC.
WCPFC12,437,"Hampton responded that the data had supported the Pacific-wide bigeye analysis undertaken in 2015. He also noted that full historical data to the extent that the data have been collected by fishing states concerned were provided to SPC for that analysis and had also been integrated into the data set. The integrated data set is very large and comprehensive, and of considerable value to ongoing stock assessment work."
WCPFC12,438,USA confirmed that it has agreed to provide the data.
WCPFC12,439,"On 8 December, SPC sought clarification on whether the draft data agreement which had come out of SC11 was acceptable to the relevant parties."
WCPFC12,440,Japan noted that the remaining issue was consistency with existing rules and measures. This CCM noted that there are already the scientific data rules and the CMM (CMM 2014-01). Japan asked for more time to formally respond.
WCPFC12,441,"China could not make a formal response at WCPFC12, but would try to provide feedback to SPC intersessionally."
WCPFC12,442,The Commission adopted the SC11 Report. 12.2 NC11
WCPFC12,443,"The Chair of NC, M. Miyahara, gave a presentation on the NC11 meeting which was held in Sapporo, Japan from 31 August – 3 September 2015. Canada, Fiji, Japan, Korea, Chinese Taipei and USA were the members in attendance and there were also observers from EU, FSM, Kiribati, Mexico, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, FFA and ISC. As a quorum (8 Members) was not achieved in Sapporo, NC met briefly in the margins at WCPFC12 to formally adopt the NC11 report. Discussions on Pacific bluefin tuna at NC11 including the Provisional Multi-Annual Rebuilding Plan starting in 2015, the initial goal of which is to rebuild the SSB to the historical median (42,592t) within 10 years with at least 60% probability. Implementation and progress of the plan will be reviewed in 2016. Reference points and WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)63  harvest control rules for the long term management will be developed at NC in 2015 and 2016. CMM 2014-04 for Pacific bluefin tuna provides for fishing effort below the 2002-2004 levels, catch limit for small fish (<30kg) reduced to 50% of the 2002-2004 levels and for large fish (>=30kg) to not increase from 2002-2004 levels, with recruitment monitoring to be established and applied. Projection of SSB under 50% small fish catch reduction under the measure shows that SSB will recover to around 68,000t, which is well above the initial goal of 42,592t even in the pessimistic scenario; low recruitment continues in next 10 years, which has never been observed in the stock’s history. NC11 recommended the incorporation of an emergency rule paragraph in the measure for when drastic drops of recruitment are detected. Discussions on North Pacific albacore included the development of reference points and harvest control rules, with agreement to advance the work on MSE at a workshop in April 2016. On North Pacific Swordfish there were discussions about the development of reference points and harvest control rules. NC11 also discussed North Pacific blue shark, with NC requesting the Commission to instruct the SC to undertake the work on determination of the designation of north pacific blue shark as a northern stock based on the information provided by ISC to SC11 and instruct SPC to analyze the available information and coordinate with ISC if further information is necessary. Finally, NC11 agreed to request the Chair to contact IATTC Secretariat to arrange a joint meeting on PBF management in conjunction with the next NC meeting. The NC Chair announced that he would contact the IATTC Executive Secretary during the meeting."
WCPFC12,444,"A number of CCMs including the USA thanked the NC Chair for his leadership. However, USA expressed disappointment that the management of Pacific bluefin tuna was the barest minimum needed, with NC11 a missed opportunity to have a meaningful discussion about its long term management. USA commented that NC members have a responsibility to recover Pacific bluefin tuna then manage the stock throughout the Pacific Ocean using the best available science. USA hoped NC members will provide feedback on its two proposals for Pacific bluefin tuna so that NC12 can adopt measures to recover and appropriately manage the stock, including implementing biologically-based reference points for the management framework and long-term rebuilding objectives. USA recognized that the current interim rebuilding target is based on the historic biomass level and took the view that NC needs to explore a more appropriate target, based on the best available science."
WCPFC12,445,Korea recognised the importance of NC in conserving northern stocks and the serious state of Pacific bluefin tuna. Korea expressed the view that the Commission needs to strengthen its efforts to conserve these northern stocks and strengthen collaboration with IATTC and with the CDS-IWG in developing a scheme which will cover Pacific bluefin tuna. Korea registered its interest in collaborating with these organizations and working groups.
WCPFC12,446,"FFA members expressed disappointment that NC11 did not achieve a quorum, reiterating their concerns that the Commission may not be as well informed about the work of the NC as other subsidiary bodies. FFA members noted that while NC has a dedicated role to lead on the management of northern stocks, it is the Commission that is responsible and accountable, noting that the Commission is rightly concerned about the bigeye tuna stock but it is four times as healthy as the Pacific bluefin stock. FFA members stressed the need for additional management attention to ensure that the stock is rebuilt to the LRP and treated as a whole-of-WCPFC priority rather than a task for NC alone, requesting that Pacific bluefin tuna be given additional priority in SC, TCC and NC next year, as well as treated as a key issue on the WCPFC13 agenda."
WCPFC12,447,"Canada was pleased with the steps taken to begin the MSE process for North Pacific Albacore, building upon the Precautionary Approach Framework adopted last year. Canada noted the ISC-led workshop in April to finalize management objectives and trusted that other NC members will also participate. Canada echoed USA’s disappointment with the lack of progress on Pacific bluefin tuna, given the poor status of the stock, and hoped that the joint IATTC-NC meeting provides an opportunity to WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)64  undertake work rebuilding the stock and developing harvest strategies, taking into account the 2016 stock assessment."
WCPFC12,448,"EU attaches great importance to the work of NC even though it is not a member, and was pleased to send an EU scientist to NC11 to assist the sub-committee’s work. EU shared the concerns of others at the limited progress achieved so far. EU noted that the depletion ratio in 2012 was estimated as less than 6%, exceeding almost all biological LRPs commonly used in fisheries management, and took the view that the measures recently adopted by WCPFC and IATTC are not commensurate with the gravity of the situation for Pacific bluefin tuna. EU made reference to ICCAT, which has successfully recovered the eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna, for which fishermen made important sacrifices. EU asked whether the target of the multiannual rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin tuna is going to be above the 20% of unfished biomass, considering that BMSY, or an appropriate proxy, should be the ultimate rebuilding target. EU also queried whether the NC workplan proposes work on agreeing reference points, acceptable levels of risk and a monitoring strategy, as the only item listed for agreement in the workplan was the emergency rule. EU encouraged harmonising approaches with harvest control work being undertaken for other tuna species. EU advised that it is interested in participating in the process of dialogue for the implementation of harvest control rules and MSE for north Pacific albacore and in participating in the new assessment cycle for Pacific bluefin tuna. EU welcomed the invitation of IATTC to the next NC meeting and supported a common approach for all tuna species under the purview of the Commission, including Pacific bluefin tuna."
WCPFC12,449,"The NC Chair explained that discussions are still taking place on reference points and harvest control rules for the long term management of the Pacific bluefin tuna stock as scheduled in CMM 2014-04. It was noted that exploitation levels over the last 60 years has fluctuated, but was always below 20% of BO, even in periods of no fishing activity, causing some to question about the use of B0 for setting up a target level. Projection of SSB under CMM 2014-04 showed SSB will recover to a relatively high level in 2024. NC would discuss the long term target and limit levels with scientists, managers and stakeholders. Regarding the NC work plan, the North Pacific albacore tasks were clear: try to establish a TRP next year if possible, or during the trial of MSE, hopefully by 2017. NC will seek to develop both an LRP and TRP next year for Pacific bluefin, and, after looking at the progress of MSE for North Pacific albacore, try to apply MSE to Pacific bluefin tuna. NC will discuss risks, probability and associated tuning information for both stocks. Regarding ICCAT discussions will take place in July 2016 for implementation of harvest control rules for North Atlantic albacore. Regarding IATTC, it was noted that Mexico was actively engaged in discussions this year as a CNM. It was hoped that the IATTC Commission would approve the results of a NC-IATTC joint meeting by the end of 2016."
WCPFC12,450,"China commented that it represented a small market for North Pacific albacore but a larger one for Pacific bluefin tuna, noting that it imports a sizeable volume of fresh product from Japan. Regarding the CDS being developed, this CCM hoped that the discussions and experiences of the ICCAT document system would be taken into account. China advised that it will attend next year’s NC meeting."
WCPFC12,451,The EU asked that the detailed workplan be annexed to the NC report. This CCM welcomed the NC consideration of the CDS for Pacific bluefin tuna and asked that the discussions be kept aligned if possible.
WCPFC12,452,Chinese Taipei took the opportunity to express concerns about the stock status of Pacific bluefin tuna. This CCM looked forward to work on more stringent conservation and management which will take into account the results of new stock assessment next year.
WCPFC12,453,PNG noted that SC has had difficulties assessing the situation of blue shark due to the lack of operational data and hoped SC12 will be provided with this data. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)65
WCPFC12,454,The IATTC Director Dr Compeán noted IATTC Resolution C-14-06 which calls for cooperation with the WCPFC and bilaterally with concerned members to cooperate in the rebuilding of this stock. Dr Compeán commented that IATTC will cooperate with WCPFC to achieve this.
WCPFC12,455,"On behalf of The Pew Charitable Trusts, WWF, Greenpeace, and ISSF, Pew expressed ongoing and deep concern with the state of Pacific bluefin, stressing that urgent action is needed to reverse its declining stock status. Even with full implementation of existing conservation measures, the Pacific bluefin population will decline through 2018, and in the next decade, there is a 1:3 chance it will drop to the lowest level ever recorded; it is currently approximately 4% of unfished biomass. These observer organizations welcomed FFA’s comments and urged the Commission to provide a clear direction to NC to take further and greater action to reduce mortality of this stock. They urged the Commission to: direct NC to prepare a robust work plan for north Pacific bluefin tuna that includes all of the elements in para. 7 of CMM 2014-06; specify that the work plan be submitted to the Commission no later than WCPFC13; and specify that the work plan shall include an objective to rebuild the population of north Pacific bluefin to a level capable of producing MSY by 2030."
WCPFC12,456,"Japan expressed concerns about the depleted stock status of Pacific bluefin tuna. This CCM noted that it worked very hard to establish CMM 2014-04 and thus made best efforts to implement this CMM in cooperation with other interested nations, including members of NC. Japan noted the importance of the species for Japan and WCPFC members and thus it was important that NC’s activities were understood, and information sharing through SC and TCC was helping this. In this context all SIDS members have been invited as an observer to NC meetings in accordance with current WCPFC rules. Japan noted that there was a two year plan to consider reference points and harvest control rules. This CCM noted that while the proposal from USA had been actively discussed with unfortunately no conclusion, Japan was ready to contribute to constructive discussions through the next year."
WCPFC12,457,"The Commission agreed to amend CMM 2014-04 (Pacific Bluefin) (see Attachment N, CMM 2015-04)."
WCPFC12,458,"The Commission tasked the SC to undertake the work on determination of the designation of North Pacific blue shark as a northern stock, based on the information provided by ISC to SC11. In this regard, the Commission tasked the Scientific Services Provider with analyzing the available information and coordinating with ISC if further information is necessary."
WCPFC12,459,The Commission adopted the NC11 Report. 12.3 TCC11
WCPFC12,460,"The TCC Vice-Chair presented the Summary Report of the 11th Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee (WCPFC12-2015-19 and 19b) held in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia 23- 29 September 2015, noting the apologies of the TCC Chair A. Cole (USA).  Both reports were taken as read. It was noted that TCC11 recommendations related to WCPFC12 agenda items 4, 6, 9, 10 and 11 have also partially been covered in discussions to date, with outstanding and pending items addressed here. It was noted that the presentation of recommendations under this agenda tiem would be only items of substance, but members were advised that all TCC11 recommendations were covered in WCPFC12-2015-19b.  The Summary Report of TCC Special Session (2015) (WCPFC12-2015-19e) was considered under Agenda 13.   WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)66  General recommendations on WCPFC IUU Vessel List"
WCPFC12,461,"General recommendations about the WCPFC IUU Vessel List were made in TCC11 Summary Report paragraphs 95-98, where TCC11 encouraged cooperation between CCMs to locate vessels on the list and, for vessels retained on the list for a long time, the Secretariat would write to flag states to establish if new information was available and to other RFMOs seeking further information. It was also recommended that communications regarding IUU allegation be conducted in English."
WCPFC12,462,"In respect of TCC11 recommendation paragraph 97 and 98, the Compliance Manager confirmed that the letters to flag states were sent on 22 October 2015 and were available on the secure side of the Commission website in WCPFC12-2015-08."
WCPFC12,463,"The Commission agreed on the importance of strengthening cooperation among all CCMs to actively work together to locate the vessels that are on the WCPFC IUU vessel list, so as to stop their illegal activities. Such cooperation should include, as appropriate and as applicable to each CCM:  a. prompt advice to the Commission Secretariat from any Flag State or other CCM who has information on any vessel on the WCPFC IUU list, including its whereabouts and any known change in name or other circumstance. In addition, Port States are requested to take any appropriate action, including, if possible, denial of port entry and services to those vessels.  b. greater scrutiny of the individuals and companies that have been involved in IUU fishing, and the sharing of this information between CCMs and RFMOs."
WCPFC12,464,"The Commission tasked the Commission Secretariat to write to the Flag States of the IUU vessels on the WCPFC IUU list, following WCPFC12 and annually in advance of TCC, to identify their last known operations and track their whereabouts and to advise the Commission of any findings."
WCPFC12,465,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat to write a letter to other RFMOs annually in advance of TCC, requesting their cooperation to locate those vessels listed on the WCPFC IUU list as at the date of the annual TCC meeting, and as applicable underlining circumstances when a vessel is listed on other RFMO IUU lists, and for the Secretariat to provide an update to the regular annual session of the Commission on any responses from RFMOs."
WCPFC12,466,The Commission agreed that English language is to be used in all communications between relevant CCMs regarding alleged IUU activities. List of CMM paragraphs to be reviewed by CMR
WCPFC12,467,"A suggested list of obligations to be assessed in 2016 and beyond – including suggested frequency of assessment was presented (WCPFC12-2015-DP20_rev2). With thanks to the USA for leading this work, it was noted that the draft removes obligations which were redundant or which posed difficulties determining which obligation was being assessed."
WCPFC12,468,There were no comments on this list.
WCPFC12,469,The Commission agreed to the list of obligations to be assessed by CMS in 2016-2018 and the agreed frequency for assessment of CMMs in forward years (Attachment O).
WCPFC12,470,"The Compliance Manager advised the Commission that the Secretariat had circulated WCPFC12-2015-19g, which contains the individual CMM paras corresponding to the list of CMMs in DP20_rev1. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)67  Noting the adoption of DP20_rev2, the Secretariat will update that document to reflect the amendments captured in WCPFC12-2015-DP20_rev2."
WCPFC12,471,The Secretariat was tasked with producing an accompanying paper that provides the detail of CMM paragraphs which will be used by the Secretariat to implement the agreed list of obligations to be assessed in dCMR (Attachment O).
WCPFC12,472,The recommendation that the Commission consider a revised timeframe for annual reporting for the CMS process for 2016 and beyond would be considered in the revision of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMM. Recommendations to revise CMMs prioritised by CMS process which were ambiguous or problematic
WCPFC12,473,The TCC Vice-Chair noted that South Pacific albacore and shark discussions were pending under agenda item 10 and sharks 11.1. TCC11’s recommendations in paras. 482-485 to revise CMMs prioritised by CMS process which were ambiguous or problematic were discussed.
WCPFC12,474,The Chair explained that TCC11 Summary Report paragraphs. 482-483 were asking the Commission to agree to not assess certain obligations.
WCPFC12,475,"EU noted that TCC decided not to assess these obligations because TCC did not have the means to assess them. However, para. 483 (regarding the tropical tuna measure) recommended that para. 28 not be assessed until appropriate limits have been formulated. EU hoped to agree those limits at this meeting on appropriate limits to be able to be assessed next year and noted that SC has a recommendation relating to this."
WCPFC12,476,"The Chair noted that WCPFC12 would be discussing yellowfin catch limits, and suggested that the Commission accept the TCC recommendation paragraph 483 and note that the Commission was looking at limits."
WCPFC12,477,"The Chair further noted that para. 484 asked for a clarification of what is meant by the term current paras. 49, 51 and 52 of CMM 2013-01 and suggested that views on this could be included in the SWG discussions, along with the clarification requested in para. 485 about how to assess para. 40. There were no objections to this."
WCPFC12,478,The Commission agreed that CMM 2007-01 paragraph 8 should not be assessed for compliance provided that all the individual associated obligations are assessed.
WCPFC12,479,"Due to TCC’s inability to assess the obligation in CMM 2013-01, paragraph 28 (yellowfin tuna purse seine catch) until appropriate limits have been formulated and adopted, the Commission agreed that it should not be included as part of the Compliance Monitoring Report assessment. Vessel Monitoring System (VMS)"
WCPFC12,480,"Regarding para. 211, which called on the Secretariat to publish and maintain a list of all RFV vessels’ WCPFC VMS reporting status, the Compliance Manager drew the Commission’s attention to WCPFC12-2015-19b Attachment 1, in which the Secretariat had prepared supporting details and the Secretariat’s thoughts on how they will implement this."
WCPFC12,481,"Japan thanked the Secretariat for the development of Attachment 1 and expressed the view that the date submitted to the communications provider was especially important to add. Japan stated that this WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)68  additional information would decrease the numbers of situations where the WCPFC VMS system cannot receive information from vessels, when the flag state VMS can receive the information. This CCM’s suggestion was to alter one of the columns to provide the ‘date of submission to VMS satellite provider’."
WCPFC12,482,Chinese Taipei asked exactly what details from the vessel tracking agreement form (VTAF) are proposed to be included in the list?
WCPFC12,483,"In response to Japan's suggestion, the Compliance Manager observed that is may not be possible to have comprehensive detail on the date a VTAF was submitted to the communication provider for all the vessels, noting that this information has only been compiled electronically for the last two years. However, the Secretariat has good records of thedate a particular MTU commenced reporting to the WCPFC VMS, and this was the reason for the inclusion of such a date in the list which confirms that the MTU was reporting at one point. In response to Chinese Taipei’s question about VTAF details, the Secretariat confirmed that the specific VTAF details would not be available for other CCMs to access through the list and would be held in WCPFC Secretariat databases, the list would simply confirm when the VTAF details were received by the Secretariat and the date that the MTU first reported to the WCPFC VMS."
WCPFC12,484,"Japan confirmed it was happy to go back to the original wording, and that it was more important to keep the information in the list."
WCPFC12,485,"Australia asked that a note indicating when the list was last updated is included, for clarity."
WCPFC12,486,The Chair agreed that would be helpful.
WCPFC12,487,There were no more comments on this matter.
WCPFC12,488,"The Commission agreed that by June 30 2016 the Secretariat should publish and maintain through secure CCM WCPFC online systems, that are accessible by authorised CCM users, a list of all RFV vessels WCPFC VMS reporting status. The list will be updated a least once a week, and will be based on the details of vessels as contained in the RFV. The list will confirm those vessels which VTAF details are held by WCPFC and where applicable the date of receipt, date of last update of the list, and date of first VMS report to WCPFC (VTAF activation date), the current VMS reporting channel to the WCPFC VMS (for example WCPFC direct; through FFA; manual reporting or not reporting) (Attachment P). Regional Observer Programme data fields"
WCPFC12,489,"The TCC Vice-Chair noted the TCC11 recommendation relating to the ROP (para. 285), to adopt changes as set out in Attachment E (WCPFC-TCC11-2015-26_rev1) to the Regional Observer Programme (ROP) Minimum Data Standards and Fields. The Secretariat tabled the attachment from the TCC11 report as a standalone document (WCPFC12-2015-19f) for easy reference."
WCPFC12,490,There were no objections to the adoption of these changes.
WCPFC12,491,"The Commission noted that in the proposed changes to the Regional Observer Programme (ROP) Minimum Data Standards and Fields some fields are new, some represent splits of prior fields and some are existing fields with new text, otherwise all other fields remain the same."
WCPFC12,492,The Commission adopted the changes to the Regional Observer Programme (ROP) Minimum Data Standards and Fields (Attachment Q).  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)69  High Seas Boarding and Inspection Scheme (HSBI)
WCPFC12,493,The TCC Vice-Chair noted the TCC11 recommendation relating to High Seas Boarding and Inspection Scheme (HSBI) (para. 319) and tasking to the Secretariat.
WCPFC12,494, There were no objections to this tasking.
WCPFC12,495,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat to develop an online technical solution to make available to authorized CCM MCS personnel, through secure login, a list of vessels that have been previously inspected under the HSBI scheme specifically, the VID, Vessel Name, IRCS, date of boarding and Name of inspecting member.  Record of Fishing Vessels"
WCPFC12,496,"The TCC Vice-Chair noted the TCC11 recommendation relating to completion of minimum required RFV fields, and instruction to the Secretariat to remove vessels (para. 345)."
WCPFC12,497,Korea commented that it was in the process of trying to delete old vessels from the RFV but some vessels lack the minimum required information needed to enable this deletion. Korea noted that these vessels were registered before the revised CMM entered into force.
WCPFC12,498,"China noted the importance of having comprehensive information on the list, however did not think it was appropriate that fishing vessels without complete information could be removed by the Secretariat directly. This CCM suggested that if a vessel on the RFV is lacking information, the Secretariat should notify the flag state and urge it to provide the missing information; the flag state can take the steps required to rectify the problem and should have the final decision to remove the vessel from the list."
WCPFC12,499,"The Chair noted that China’s suggestion would change the nature of and negate some parts of the recommendation and put the responsibility on the flag state to remove the vessel, with the Secretariat’s role being to notify the flag state at a certain point in time, and asked for comments on this."
WCPFC12,500,"The Secretariat advised that it was able to take on the tasking in the recommendation. The Compliance Manager confirmed that, if the recommendation was accepted, the Secretariat intended to ensure CCMs are advised which vessels would fall into this category, noting that only a few CCMs had vessels in this situation. The Secretariat confirmed that they could advise relevant CCMs well before the 30 June deadline in the recommendation. The Compliance Manager reminded the Commission that the system does not allow new vessels to be listed without the minimum required fields."
WCPFC12,501,"USA agreed that the suggested change negates the TCC recommendation, suggesting that given the explanation from the Secretariat regarding vessels currently on the list with incomplete information, the recommendation should be accepted as is or defer the adoption of the recommendation."
WCPFC12,502,China accepted the recommendation with the Secretariat’s explanation and assistance.
WCPFC12,503,"The Commission agreed that all vessels on the RFV shall complete the minimum required fields by 30 June 2016, and instructed the Secretariat to remove any vessels without the minimum required data fields after that date.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)70"
WCPFC12,504,"The Secretariat confirmed that during the first half of 2016 it will provide advice to the relevant flag CCMs whose vessel records on the RFV contain gaps in the minimum required fields, so that the relevant flag CCM may take appropriate steps in advance of the 30 June 2016 deadline. Tier-scoring system for data provision"
WCPFC12,505,"The TCC Vice-Chair noted the three TCC recommendations relating to the review, refinement and possible use to assist in the evaluation of other CMMs, of the tier scoring system (para. 387-389)."
WCPFC12,506,"In response to a query about whether the recommendation had any budget implications, the Secretariat noted its understanding that the work would be part of the regular support SPC provides and the regular data paper SPC prepares for SC."
WCPFC12,507,The Commission agreed that the tier scoring system adopted at WCPFC11 shall be used to assist in assessing compliance of CCMs for the provision of scientific data in 2016 and following years.
WCPFC12,508,"The Commission tasked SPC with further refining the tier scoring system to provide, among other things, an indicator of compliance of CCMs as a whole with provision of scientific data."
WCPFC12,509,"The Commission agreed to explore the usefulness of using the tier scoring system to assist in the evaluation of compliance with other CMMs, including the possible development of an indicator of overall compliance of each CCM in relation to the totality of agreed WCPFC obligations. Charter Notification Scheme"
WCPFC12,510,The TCC Vice-Chair noted the TCC11 recommendation relating to the charter notification scheme and its extension of the measure for the next three years (para. 497).
WCPFC12,511,"The Commission agreed to extend CMM 2012-05 (Charter Notification Scheme), which expires at the end of 2015 for the next three years (Attachment R). TCC Workplan 2016- 2018"
WCPFC12,512,"The TCC Vice-Chair noted the TCC11 recommendation relating to the TCC work plan (para. 517), discussions on which Australia led in the margins of WCPFC12."
WCPFC12,513,"Australia reported that WCPFC12-2015-DP21_rev1 had been posted and includes comments from one CCM. A SWG had met and there were some additional changes. There was still a clarification outstanding under subparagraph L of the draft TCC work plan regarding sharks, and the table was altered to accommodate some of the bigeye tuna overfishing tasks."
WCPFC12,514,"Finalisation of the work plan was held open until the completion of the shark-related discussions. On 8 December, Australia reported that after discussions in the margins, the revised TCC work plan was ready for adoption. There was agreement to delete sub-paragraph L – sharks."
WCPFC12,515,"The Chair asked if the Commission agreed to delete sub-paragraph L and accept the 2016-2018 TCC workplan, in light of the outcome on WCPFC12-2015-DP26_rev1."
WCPFC12,516,"EU asked why it needed to be deleted, noting that one opposing delegation had been concerned it would weaken the fins naturally attached proposal. EU confirmed there were no alternative ways, and that WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)71  EU would be strengthening its proposal. This CCM noted that several delegations noted this issue was to be discussed at TCC."
WCPFC12,517,The Chair asked if there were objections to allowing TCC to consider alternatives with respect to sharks (sub-paragraph L).
WCPFC12,518,China supported maintaining the sub-paragraph but replacing the reference to the ‘finning ban’ with a reference to the relevant measure.
WCPFC12,519,"EU recalled that the choices are either to use the fins naturally attached method or the fin-to-carcass ratio and noted that TCC had called for the Commission to help as it could not evaluate the 5% fin-to-carcass ratio. It was noted that this impasse had led to TCC not even assessing compliance with the shark measure in 2015, and this language gave TCC some guidance."
WCPFC12,520,"After brief discussions, the language was cleared."
WCPFC12,521,The Commission adopted the TCC Workplan 2016-2018 (Attachment S).  WCPFC Information Management System (IMS)
WCPFC12,522,The TCC Vice-Chair noted the TCC11 recommendation relating to the Secretariat IMS and website (para. 522).
WCPFC12,523,There were no comments on or objections to this recommendation.
WCPFC12,524,The Commission agreed to maintain commitments that will ensure the continued development and enhancement of the Commission Secretariat IMS over the next 2-3 years.
WCPFC12,525,China noted that discussions took place at TCC11 about GMT being used in relation to reporting deadlines and asked for confirmation whether this was included in the amended CMS measure.
WCPFC12,526,The TCC Vice-Chair confirmed that GMT was included in the current draft of the measure which is intended to replace CMM 2014-07.
WCPFC12,527,The Chair thanked the TCC Vice-Chair for presenting the recommendations from TCC11.  12.3.1 CDS-IWG (Work Plan)
WCPFC12,528,"On behalf of the CDS-IWG Chair, A. Kinol (PNG), who could not attend WCPFC12, the Compliance Manager gave a brief summary of the CDS-IWG work this year, noting there had been a productive 2-day session held from 21 - 22 September 2015, immediately prior to TCC11 in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia. It had been one of the most involved discussions on a possible CDS scheme that the Commission has had to date and it resulted in a considerable work plan for CCMs to progress through 2016."
WCPFC12,529,"The Commission received the TCC11 recommendations on the CDS-IWG report and work plan (WCPFC12-2015-19c). Para. 414 of the TCC11 report contained a recommendation relating to the CDS-IWG and WCPFC12-2015-19b Table 3 (starting on page 23) contained recommendations from the CDS-IWG. Referring to the work plan and timeline, which is the page 26 attachment to the working paper, the Compliance Manager noted the four broad groups of activities to be progressed by the CDS working group: the scope of work, a program of intersessional work related to the development of CDS standards, WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)72  Mass Balance Reconciliation (with a trial agreed, with a 2013 calendar reference year), and CMM development. It was noted that para. 40 of the doc still referred to Pacific bluefin in square brackets as, despite discussions at TCC11 the inclusion of this species had not been agreed in the CDS-IWG outcomes."
WCPFC12,530,"In respect of the proposed Mass Balance Reconciliation trial (the Compliance Manager referred the meeting to WCPFC12-2015-19b Attachment 3 (pages 33 – 36), and noted that the trial involves as a first step that CCMs include in their 2016 Annual Report Part 1 certain extra data on disposal, receipt and redistribution of bigeye, yellowfin, skipjack and albacore species for 2013 calendar year.  At CDS-IWG and during TCC11 many CCMs had noted their expectation that their reporting was likely to be incomplete.  This was also expected to present challenges for the Secretariat to try to undertake a detailed mass balance reconciliation analysis of the 2013 submitted information.  The Secretariat has set out in Attachment 3 an alternative approach to that originally proposed during the CDS-IWG, which is that the Secretariat would compile the available information from CCMs Annual Report Part 1 into two tables, which would be circulated for the CDS-IWG in 2016. At this point there were no budgetary implications of this work."
WCPFC12,531,The Chair thanked the Chair of the CDS-IWG in his absence and the Compliance Manager for her brief presentation.
WCPFC12,532,The Commission accepted TCC11’s recommendations with the Secretariat’s proposed modifications to the 2016 Mass Balance Reconciliation tasking and adopted the report of the CDS-IWG (WCPFC12-2015-19c) and the 2016 CDS-IWG work plan (Attachment T).  12.3.2 ERandEM-IWG (Work Plan)
WCPFC12,533,"The Commission received and discussed the TCC’s recommendations on the report (TCC11 Summary Report para 397), the ERandEM-IWG recommendations (WCPFC12-2015-19b Table 4) and work plan of the ERandEM-IWG (WCPFC12-2015-19d). The Chair of the ERandEM-IWG, K. Smith (Australia) presented WCPFC12-2015-19d, a brief summary of the working group’s activities in 2015. The ERandEM-IWG met in July in Nadi, Fiji in conjunction with the IWG-ROP meeting. A priority task for the group was to consider data standards, specifications and procedures for the electronic submission of observer and operational catch and effort data. The workshop considered draft SSPs developed by SPC and the WCPFC Secretariat and noted that they gave effect to and were consistent with current regional requirements relating to data fields and data submission. A number of existing international standards are also included. The draft SSPs covered Eastern High Seas Pocket Special Management Area reporting (CMM 2010-02), High Seas Pocket One Special Management Area reporting (CMM 2014-01), manual position reporting in the event of an ALC/MTU failure, operational level catch and effort data and observer data. The Chair noted that a number of CCMs committed to work with the Science Provider to test and further refine the electronic data standards and strongly encouraged those CCMs to work with the Secretariat and SPC to progress this work."
WCPFC12,534,"The ERandEM-IWG Chair reiterated that a decision to adopt the standards does not make e-reporting mandatory, but supports those countries looking to implement E-reporting as part of domestic processes. The adoption of standards will also ensure that the Secretariat’s databases and systems are ready to receive and exchange data. Many of the data fields are used frequently in WCPFC’s reporting such as vessel name, vessel type, species codes, latitude/longitude and, as such, there are clear linkages and efficiencies for close engagement with other IWGs."
WCPFC12,535,"The ERandEM-IWG noted the numerous trials that were underway in relation to E-monitoring and noted that E-reporting standards support the development of E-monitoring. The working group noted WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)73  that E-monitoring should be considered in fisheries where there is a higher perceived risk to the safety of observers and that electronic forms of data submission should be authenticated to support compliance investigations. Next steps for the group included testing of the draft SSPs and further refinement, consideration of E-monitoring standards, review of progress against the terms of reference and workplan. WCPFC12 endorsed the recommendations in paragraph 397 (a, b, c, d, e) of the TCC11 report."
WCPFC12,536,"The ERandEM-IWG Chair was thanked for her efforts to progress work in this area, with the Commission Chair noting that it contributes valuably to the Commission’s data."
WCPFC12,537,"On behalf of the Pew Charitable Trusts, Humane Society International, and WWF, Pew thanked the Chair of the ERandEM-IWG, the Secretariat and SPC for the working group’s important work. These organizations noted that reporting, monitoring and observing of vessels in the Convention area continues to be a challenge, particularly for some of the longline fleets who struggle to reach the 5% coverage of effort level and opined that this hampers scientific efforts, which require a minimum of 20% observer coverage. It was noted that Electronic monitoring has been shown to offer a viable complement to observers, and encouraged CCMs to submit data necessary to test the E-reporting standards. These organizations encouraged continued work of the ERandEM-IWG and for TCC and the Commission to adopt proposed E-reporting and E-monitoring standards swiftly, to allow those countries who are seeking to implement these technologies to do so, be consistent with one another, and facilitate data and information sharing."
WCPFC12,538,"In response to a question about whether the ERandEM-IWG agreed to the draft SSPs for the five key areas, the ERandEM-IWG Chair advised that the working group had agreed to the draft SSPs but had noted that further testing was required; this testing had not yet been undertaken."
WCPFC12,539,The Commission accepted TCC11s recommendation and adopted the ERandEM-IWG report and work plan (WCPFC-TCC11-2015-19d).
WCPFC12,540,"The Commission noted that further testing and refinement of the five draft electronic data standards developed in 2015 (WCPFC-TCC11-2015-20, Attachment 5) is required by the ERandEM-IWG."
WCPFC12,541,The Commission agreed that a master list of electronic data standards shall be maintained by the Secretariat with input from the Scientific Services Provider and any updates shall be notified to CCMs on an annual basis.
WCPFC12,542,The Commission noted advice from the ERandEM-IWG supported by TCC that a decision to report electronically in future be captured by an amendment to the relevant CMM which also makes reference to the master list.
WCPFC12,543,The Commission encouraged the development of Electronic Monitoring by CCMs in areas where data gaps exist such as longline observer coverage and high seas transhipment.
WCPFC12,544,The Commission noted that the ERandEM-IWG should meet prior to SC12 in 2016. 12.4 IWG-ROP
WCPFC12,545,"The Commission received and discussed the report of the Regional Observer Programme – Intersessional Working Group (IWG-ROP) (WCPFC12-2015-21), that included proposed revisions to CMM 2009-06 on carrier notification of intent to transship (WCPFC12-2015-21a) and IWG-ROP pre-notification process for alleged infringements (WCPFC12-2015-21b). The IWG-ROP Chair, R. Clarke WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)74  (USA) gave a brief summary of the working group’s activities in 2015. The IWG-ROP met 6 – 8 July 2015 in Nadi, Fiji. The Commission had tasked the IWG-ROP to work on a number of elements, through different bodies of the Commission: preventing and deterring alcohol-related misconduct of observers, ROP identification cards, high seas transshipment monitoring, processes to facilitate the provision of data, including observer reports, from the observer providers and placement information from Flag States to the Commission, ROP coverage on longline vessels, along with the definition of the responsibilities of observer providers and flag states. The attachments to the IWG-ROP meeting report included a recommended modification to CMM 2009-06 on transhipment."
WCPFC12,546,"The IWG-ROP meeting report was presented to both SC11 and TCC11, garnering no specific comments. Given the technical nature of the report recommendations, it was decided that two of the substantive recommendations should be summarised and distributed for review by CCMs in advance of WCPFC12 (Circular 2015/82 of 13 November 2015). In that circular three areas were highlighted:  a) IWG-ROP-recommended changes to the transshipment measure for carrier notification of intent to tranship and observer information,  b) pre-notification process from observer providers to flag CCMs of possible alleged infringements by their vessels, and  c) sourcing of observers and the implementation of ‘hybrid approach’."
WCPFC12,547,"With regard to the proposal to provide the Secretariat with additional information related to observer placements on carriers in the Convention area, comments from one group of CCMs during WCPFC12 indicated that they were not comfortable with the proposed recommendation of the IWG-ROP and, despite work in the margins of WCPFC12, these concern could not be resolved. The IWG-ROP Chair recommends that the proposed amendments to CMM 2009-06 be referred back to TCC for further work including, and potentially be included in larger modifications to the measure as proposed by some delegations. The IWG-ROP Chair noted the importance that the Secretariat be well informed about observers on carrier vessels given growing concerns related to health and safety, and hoped this work will continue to be considered a priority of the TCC."
WCPFC12,548,"On the second substantive recommendation related to pre-notification process from observer providers to flag CCMs of possible alleged infringements by their vessels, the IWG-ROP reported that informal discussions with CCMs suggests that this IWG-ROP recommendation is likely to have a more positive outcome. At IWG-ROP4 a detailed recommendation was agreed with an equally detailed procedure developed (found in Attachment 7 of the IWG-ROP Summary Report (WCPFC12-2015-21)), relating to a pre-notification process for alleged infringements. This essentially involved expediting the regionally utilized observer GEN-3 form (to be renamed WCPFC Observer Trip Monitoring Summaries), which is a checklist marked by the observers upon disembarking the vessel in the recommended manner which includes a summary to be provided to the vessel operator in a manner that ensures the safety of the observer and the integrity of the data. A flow chart was developed by the Secretariat that describes how the process would be implemented, in response to a suggestion from RMI at TCC11. The figure is shown in WCPFC12-2015-21b."
WCPFC12,549,"The Observer Programme Coordinator explained the process in more detail for WCPFC12. The GEN-3 document is handed over with other relevant data by the observer to the observer provider which ideally involves the debriefer. If no allegations or infringements are reported, by the observer (no boxes checked) the form is sent to the data provider as usual for entry into the database. If there were allegations or alleged infringement noted, the observer provider first ensures that the observer is not going on any further (immediate) trips on that vessel and the observer provider can make the decision about the WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)75  appropriate time to submit a pre-notification to the Secretariat. The dates of the trip will be identified as part of the pre-notification. The Secretariat will analyse the GEN-3 form and (where the relevant fields are ticked) they will communicate the alleged infringement at the request of the flag state in a timely manner as possible; the flag state has the discretion to communicate with the vessel and request additional information from the observer provider to support an investigation."
WCPFC12,550,The IWG-ROP Chair noted that he had received one comment on the proposed process – that the coastal state in whose waters the allegation has occurred should be included in any notification scheme. There was no objection to this proposal.
WCPFC12,551,"The Compliance Manager commented on the practical aspects of the proposed modification to the IWG-ROP process.  She noted that it was a matter for the Commission to specify the circumstances under which the pre-notification process would operate.  She further noted that initially it is expected that only once the Secretariat receives through SPC-OFP the full ROP data for a particular trip, that the location where any alleged infringements occurred would be able to be determined. Whereas currently the GEN-3 form does not have detail on the exact position where an alleged infringement takes place, so the Secretariat would not be able to direct the pre-notification information to the relevant coastal CCM until it is provided with the data to confirm which EEZ would be the applicable one to receive the pre-notification. The Compliance Manager noted that if the principle of the process is agreed, it would undertake to implement this the process based on the available information."
WCPFC12,552,"On the third substantive recommendation, the IWG-ROP Chair noted that limited progress was made at the IWG-ROP on the issue of sourcing of observers and the hybrid approach. One recommendation was that CCMs were to provide to the Commission a list of the national observer programs they are associated with for observers placed on their longline vessels. In summation of the elements highlighted in the circular, the IWG-ROP Chair also addressed the issue of the continued tenure of the working group, noting there has to be real consideration of the cost of holding these meetings. It was noted that the transshipment notification amendment would not be recommended to the Commission. With the modification of the coastal state being included, the IWG-ROP report was recommended for the Commission’s approval."
WCPFC12,553,"The Commission Chair thanked the IWG-ROP Chair for his efforts in 2015, and noted that holding the meetings was an expensive process. The Commission considered the three main elements in turn. The first element related to transshipment and the IWG-ROP had requested that TCC do further work on amendments to the measure."
WCPFC12,554,"RMI noted the linkages between the ROP and issues with transshipment in general and that when discussions turn to transshipment issues those recommendations can be raised again. This CCM considered that work on transshipment issues needed to continue, and noted that the TCC would be looking at strengthening the measure."
WCPFC12,555,"The Chair sought for clarification that the Commission was going to task the TCC with taking a further look at the issue of transshipment and provide some guidance to the Commission on CMM 2009-06. There may be a need to look at the ROP measure, given the multitude of cross-linkages. On these specific recommendations we are looking to task TCC with taking another look. There were no objections to the Chair’s proposal."
WCPFC12,556,"The Commission noted the IWG-ROP’s recommendations on carrier notification of intent to tranship including amendments to CMM 2009-06, and tasked TCC12 to further consider the proposed amendments to CMM 2009-06 (WCPFC12-2015-21a). WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)76"
WCPFC12,557,"At the outset of discussions on processes to facilitate provision of observer data and placement information to the Commission, the Chair reminded WCPFC12 that some members proposed including pre-notification of the relevant coastal state."
WCPFC12,558,"The IWG-ROP Chair noted that a balance needed to be struck between observer safety and flag state requests for information and referred delegates to the process outlined in Attachment 7 of the IWG-ROP report. FFA proposed language to that about the coastal state being notified as well as the flag state, with no objection heard."
WCPFC12,559,"RMI stressed the high priority of observer safety. This CCM commented that the process has application for both purse-seine and longline observer placements and does address safety, but more work needed to be done on deterrence – avoiding issues in the first place that may compromise the safety of observers. RMI asked about the actions that are to be undertaken by the flag state to ensure safety of observer and the provision of data to respond to issues which are raised."
WCPFC12,560,The IWG-ROP Chair responded that there was a general assumption that in the cases of allegations of harassment or physical intimidation that an investigation would be initiated: the vessel would be made aware of the allegation and the enforcement authorities would become informed. There would be a two-fold response.
WCPFC12,561,"The EU supported the recommendation including the changes suggested by FFA for the relevant coastal state to also be notified and agreed it was a two-way process, with the flag state and coastal state receiving information. This CCM asked about the provision of this information being done in a ‘timely manner’, commenting that it was important for flag states to receive this information as soon as possible. This CCM was comfortable with seeing how the current proposed method works and then deciding in the future whether it needs further refinement."
WCPFC12,562,"The IWG-ROP Chair supported this, noting that the step was admittedly modest, as it is an attempt to build a larger process; if appropriate it can then be streamlined in the future. The IWG-ROP Chair stressed that this does not in any way impinge on the standard operating processes within national observer programs. These national programs may decide that the GEN-3 form can be expedited, for others that may not be the case. This is why the working group decided the process does need a strict timeline."
WCPFC12,563,"FFA members supported the recommendation to implement a pre-notification process, as a means to support CCMs, in particular flag States, to initiate responses to potential violations. In line with CMM 2013-06, and the practicalities associated with implementing the proposed notification process, these CCMs proposed a delayed implementation of six months from adoption, to provide the necessary time to establish mechanisms for its implementation. These CCMs reminded the Commission that this process was proposed by FFA members at WCPFC11, as a means of increasing the usability of ROP data by flag states for compliance purposes. At the same time, FFA members were not seeking consideration of the removal of the para. 1(c) of Attachment K, Annex B of CMM 2007-01. Noting that observer safety was highlighted this year, FFA members pointed to the necessity of keeping their observers safe as they carry out their duties, and therefore strongly recommended the removal of para. 1(c)."
WCPFC12,564,"China wanted to see that the pre-notification along with evidence, noting that without evidence it was difficult to begin an investigation. This CMM suggested that for vessels on the high seas, the flag state should be notified and has the responsibility to punish the vessel. For vessels operating in another state’s jurisdiction, that investigation should be conducted by the coastal state with punishment from the coastal state, with perhaps no need to give the flag state prior notification. This CCM commented that it had no difficulties with the phrase ‘timely manner’.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)77"
WCPFC12,565,"The IWG-ROP Chair clarified that the proposal is just for the GEN-3 form being subject to an expedited process. The flag state will receive the form from the observer provider, and, with the modification proposed by FFA, a relevant coastal state will too. For a vessel in an EEZ, the form will go to the coastal state, and for a vessel on the high seas it will go just to the flag state."
WCPFC12,566,"Korea generally agreed with the direction proposed by the IWG-ROP on this issue, but believes there need to be a way to ensure greater accessibility by the flag state to the observer report. The GEN-3 information is simply yes/no – it does not provide a detailed account of the alleged infringement including when it happened. Those things are needed by a flag state to start an investigation. Corresponding information such as observer’s journals would be helpful. This CCM hoped the IWG-ROP would continue its work to find ways for greater accessibility of this information, and suggested there also needs to be a system where information from observers and vessel masters can be cross-checked."
WCPFC12,567,Some CCMs commented that if an observer is on the high seas both parties should get the report.
WCPFC12,568,"The Chair noted that Korea was happy to go along with the proposal and clarified that the FFA had requested 6 months to implement it. The focus of this adoption would be on the pre-notification process, with later implementation."
WCPFC12,569,"The Commission adopted the pre-notification process from observer providers to flag CCMs of possible alleged infringements by their vessels and put forward by the IWG-ROP, as amended to include data being provided to the coastal state when an alleged infringement takes place in a coastal state's waters (Attachment U)."
WCPFC12,570,"The Commission agreed that all ROP authorized observer programmes provide to the Commission Secretariat in a timely manner the ROP minimum data elements on the WCPFC Observer Trip Monitoring Summary, or which are included in SPC/FFA General Form 3 (Attachment 7 to IWG-ROP4 Summary Report), as a means of supporting a pre-notification process from observer providers to flag of possible alleged infringements by their vessels. To facilitate the pre-notification process it was recommended that only those data elements answered in the affirmative by observers would be provided to the Commission Secretariat for transmittal to the flag CCM and as appropriate the relevant coastal State for alleged infringements in their waters."
WCPFC12,571,"The Commission agreed that to support the pre-notification process, that there are two additional fields that should be provided by observer providers to the Commission Secretariat to support a flag CCMs investigations of any possible alleged infringements. These are:                          1. “start date of trip and end date of trip”                          2. “status of the debriefing process” i.e, “debriefed”, “pre debriefed” or “not debriefed”"
WCPFC12,572,The Commission noted that the requirement of providing the pre-notification data elements to the Commission Secretariat may not be required where there are domestic requirements enabling access by vessel operators to observer data.
WCPFC12,573,The Commission agreed that the implementation of the pre-notification process would be delayed for six months following WCPFC12.
WCPFC12,574,"The Commission briefly took up discussions on the FFA proposal to remove para. 1(c) of Attachment K, Annex B of CMM 2007-01, however, a number of CCMs objected to the FFA proposal relating to the ability of vessel captains to see observer reports first being introduced during the agenda WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)78  item discussions rather than being submitted as a proposal in the usual way, ahead of time and in hardcopy."
WCPFC12,575,Japan noted that this was a long standing topic of discussion and recalled the intervention by China at the beginning of the meeting about appropriate notice being given for proposals. It was impossible for the Japanese delegation to discuss the issue without this notice having been given for this proposal.
WCPFC12,576,The Chair noted that the Commission was not going to achieve consensus on the proposal.
WCPFC12,577,"The Chair asked WCPFC12 what additional work it wanted the IWG-ROP to do, noting her sense that the working group has completed its tasks."
WCPFC12,578,FFA members considered that another meeting of the IWG-ROP would not resolve some of the long-standing issues relating to the implementation of the ROP. These CCMs took the view that progress can be made among CCMs intersessionally.
WCPFC12,579,"The Commission adopted the IWG-ROP report including its recommendations, except where otherwise noted herein."
WCPFC12,580,"WCPFC12 agreed that the IWG-ROP would not be tasked to meet in 2016, and thanked the IWG-ROP Chair Ray Clarke (USA) for his leadership of the group. 12.5 FAD Management Options IWG"
WCPFC12,581,"The FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair, B. Kumasi (PNG), presented the report of the first FAD Management Options – Intersessional Working Group (WCPFC12-2015-22_rev2). The working group, which had progressed its work electronically until the 27-28 November in Bali, Indonesia had the following terms of reference: collection of additional data on FADs and their use in WCPO fisheries; FAD marking, identification, and the use of electronic signatures; FAD monitoring, tracking and control, FAD management options; and advice on FAD marking and monitoring for WCPO-wide application. It was noted that the working group’s webpage on the Commission website went live in March 2015 and included over 20 documents. The meeting record was taken as read and the FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair highlighted the working group’s recommendations, noting that the intent of the November meeting was mainly to address the first two terms of reference but that it also began to address other terms of reference. The FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair thanked the Marshall Islands Marine Resource Authority and the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council for hosting the August 2015 Majuro workshop on options to help improve WCPFC bigeye conservation and management, and Australia for funding his attendance. This meeting had highlighted that WCPFC did not have a research plan for FAD work. The FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair noted that the main recommendations from the 27-28 November meeting report were for a research plan to be drafted, and for the Secretariat to conduct two consultancies – to produce a report on options and considerations for marking and identification of FADs to be deployed and, associated with the research plan, to produce proposed draft data fields to be reported by vessel operators, with both for consideration by SC12 and TCC12."
WCPFC12,582,The Commission Chair noted that a key consideration along with the recommendations was whether the working group should continue.
WCPFC12,583,EU saw the FADMgmtOptions-IWG discussions as useful to inform future work. EU supported the consultancy on FAD Marking and Identification but questioned the need for a feasibility study related to data fields. The work was a priority and needed to be in the budget being decided during WCPFC12. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)79  EU noted that similar work was taking place in other RFMOs and it was important to enhance dialogue with them on cross-cutting issues. This CCM supported holding the next meeting back to back with another meeting to reduce costs.
WCPFC12,584,The FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair advised that he was waiting for the Commission to make the decision on the consultancies before going out to the consultants for cost estimates; the work related to data fields would be a desktop analysis with initial inputs from the SPC-OFP/Secretariat so the costs should not be overly large.
WCPFC12,585,"USA agreed that this was important work and supported the working group continuing. This CCM further agreed that consideration of how to leverage the work other tuna RFMOs was important, noting that while WCPFC was unique in many ways, on FADs there were similarities. USA asked that a preliminary or rough cost be provided for the FAC’s consideration during WCPFC12."
WCPFC12,586,"PNA members noted that they will implement a trial FAD tracking and registration programme in 2016 to meet a range of scientific, compliance and management purposes, and FAD charging, intended to serve as an incentive to fish on free schools and reduce FAD use as well as replace the FAD closure in order to remove the disproportionate burden transferred onto SIDS. PNA members prioritised improved understanding of the impact of FAD fishing on target stocks, and supported development of a research plan for FADs to address the economic costs of the management actions. They supported the production of a report on FAD marking and identification, and recommendations for improving the collection and reporting of data on FADs. These members supported the transfer of responsibility for provision of certain FAD data from observers to vessel operators."
WCPFC12,587,"Japan commented that its priority for the research plan would be to understand how the purse-seine catch of bigeye tuna could be reduced, noting research presented to SC11 showing that 9-14 vessels were responsible for 25% of the bigeye tuna purse-seine catches in 2010-2013 (Paragraph 468 of the SC11 Summary Report)."
WCPFC12,588,"EU took up Japan’s point, about the importance of research on areas where higher concentration of catches of bigeye tuna are caught, noting that a project integrating a range of purse seine data in order to better understand eventually contribute in reducing the impact of the purse seine fishery on bigeye tuna will soon be undertaken by SPC, funded with the EU voluntary contribution for 2015.  This project could support the development of potential measures to reduce interactions with bigeye tuna in the purse seine fishery in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean.  The EU considered that this study focusses on one of the priorities of the Commission.  ."
WCPFC12,589,"Korea generally supported the direction of the working group. Regarding the research plan, Korea felt that the working group should focus on improving current FAD management rather than exploring new technologies and systems. Korea commented that the working group should cooperate with SC more actively, and emphasised the importance of taking relevant data confidentiality issues into account. This CCM asked for the meeting documents to be prepared well in advance of the next FADMgmtOptions-IWG meeting to enable active engagement by all CCMs in its work."
WCPFC12,590,"On behalf of The Pew Charitable Trusts, Birdlife, Greenpeace, ISSF and WWF, Pew noted the FADMgmtOptions-IWG’s draft schedule for discussing management options, but urged members to progress the work comprehensively and as a matter of priority. These observer organizations supported designing a research agenda on FADs and exploring a marking scheme, noting that sufficient data is already available. Pew and WWF noted their paper summarizing current information on management options; it highlighted that options that directly manage bigeye held the most promise for reducing mortality. Pew estimated that approximately 120,000 FADs were deployed annually across all oceans and WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)80  their use was increasing, which underlines the importance of addressing the management implications of FADs. These organizations saw supporting the FADMgmtOptions-IWG as important, to ensure it could effectively explore and recommend management options for the purse-seine fishery."
WCPFC12,591,"Japan commented that FAD management was important for reduction of purse seine bigeye catch and the FADMgmtOptions-IWG should address it with its planned tasks.  Japan brought to the Commission’s attention issues relating to the definition of a FAD as outlined in CMM 2009-02; para. 3 which stipulates any object or group of objects, of ‘any size’.  Japan expressed the view that if this definition is applied as it is without consideration of the real situation on board a vessel, it was possible that an observer might judge that a set had been conducted within one nautical mile of a FAD by a piece of plastic or wood chopstick found in the net although the fishing master had not intended to conduct a FAD set.  During the FAD closure period there is a risk that the operation was judged as illegal even if the fishing master did not notice small materials and unintentionally circled them.  This CCM considered this to be one of the most problematic FAD-related issues and expressed the view that this needs to be reviewed.  Japan emphasized the importance of development of a framework to address this issue and noted its intention to propose a draft to the next TCC or other opportunities.  ."
WCPFC12,592,The FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair noted that this issue would be taken into account during discussions on FAD management.
WCPFC12,593,"The Commission adopted the report of the first meeting of the FADMgmtOptions-IWG, held 27-28 November 2015 (WCPFC12-2015-22_rev2), and the work plan (Attachment V)."
WCPFC12,594,"The Commission agreed that a consultancy should be undertaken early in 2016 to produce a report on options and considerations for Marking and Identification of FADs to be deployed, for consideration at SC12 and TCC12. The consultancy should be based on the draft prospectus (Attachment V) and among other things take into consideration electronic signature and physical marking aspects from the 2016 PNA trial tracking programme and that used in other tuna RFMOs. The consultancy should also provide advice on the feasibility of options of physical marking of the buoy, physical marking of the buoy and the FAD attachment, and electronic identification, along with the costs and benefits of each option. The consultancy should also take into account Attachment E to the report of the first meeting of the FADMgmtOptions-IWG Report (WCPFC12-2015-22_rev2)."
WCPFC12,595,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat and Scientific Services Provider to work with the FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair and Vice-Chair to further develop the draft outline of a research plan in 2016, based on Attachment D of the report of the first meeting of the FADMgmtOptions-IWG (WCPFC12-2015-22_rev2). The draft research plan should be for consideration and input by SC12 and TCC12 before submission to WCPFC13. The draft plan should incorporate some consideration of costs and benefits of various research and data collection activities to assist with prioritizing the work. Consideration should also be given within the plan to addressing both target and non-target species."
WCPFC12,596,"The Commission agreed that vessel operators should provide data on FADs covering the following two major areas:           a. FAD design and construction of FAD to be deployed or encountered (materials, electronics, size etc)            b. FAD activity (deploying, retrieving, setting, visiting, loss etc).   WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)81"
WCPFC12,597,The Commission noted that the FADMgmtOptions-IWG recommendations that:                 (i) the FAD data fields to be reported by vessel operators should be based on the WCPFC ROP Minimum Standard Data Fields and the data fields collected by other RFMOs;               (ii) data collected by observers on FADs can be used for verification of FAD activities of vessels;              (iii) the FAD data should be provided to the Commission via flag State electronically using appropriate systems such as FAD e-logbooks or information systems such as PNA iFIMS etc.
WCPFC12,598,"The Commission agreed that a consultancy be undertaken in early 2016, tasked with producing proposed draft data fields to be reported by vessel operators for consideration at SC12 and TCC12."
WCPFC12,599,The Commission agreed that the FADMgmtOptions-IWG should continue in 2016. 12.6 Harvest Strategy Workshop (MOW)
WCPFC12,600,"Ian Cartwright presented the report of the Harvest Strategy Workshop (HSW), previously named the Management Objectives Workshop (MOW), which was held just prior to WCPFC12 (WCPFC12-2015-23). The HSW was the fourth in a series of informal workshops convened by the Commission to facilitate and support the development of harvest strategies by the Commission. The focus of these workshops had been on capacity building, awareness raising and identification and discussion of a broad range of objectives for key fisheries. The workshop has partly changed emphasis and focused on options to advance the harvest strategy approach and discussion of draft CMMs as well. The workshop had provided an opportunity for the fisheries managers of all CCMs to exchange views on key management issues. Some discussion points included: that context was important in making comparisons (e.g. Atlantic albacore vs. southern bluefin tuna); there were variations between RFMOs including assumptions on stock-recruitment relationships, risk levels, LRPs; capacity building and engagement important; risk levels have slipped through the cracks; it is advantageous for allocation to have been decided in advance of developing a harvest strategy but it was not an essential prerequisite. Cartwright thanked ABNJ and the EU for the funding provided for this workshop."
WCPFC12,601,A lengthy discussion took place as members considered whether to hold another workshop.
WCPFC12,602,"PNA members considered that the meeting provided a good basis for developing a harvest control rule for skipjack, but broadly these CCMs took the view that the value of the workshops had declined as discussions shifted from general approaches to more specific issues on which decisions need to be taken. These CCMs commented that the SC management issues theme was a forum to discuss reference points and harvest control rules, and was the appropriate place for the Commission’s work on harvest strategies."
WCPFC12,603,"EU expressed the view that the MOW/HSW should continue, representing real added value. EU saw it as an important step between SC and the Commission discussions, as it operationalised the science."
WCPFC12,604,"Australia saw value in the workshop, or a forum like the workshop, to think about and discuss the scientific findings and their implications for management arrangements outside the Commission setting. This CCM stated that, with the harvest strategies work being undertaken, the workshop represented a valuable forum, but noted PNA members’ comments and agreed that there could be benefit to holding a workshop of this kind earlier in the commission process to enable time for development of proposal following discussions. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)82"
WCPFC12,605,"Palau stated that the skipjack outcomes provided a basis for work by SPC to be presented to the next SC meeting and supported PNA’s view on the way ahead, reiterating that PNA members considered the annual workshops, held before Commission meetings, to have served their purpose, preferring work to be integrated into the work of the SC, TCC and Commission."
WCPFC12,606,"New Zealand noted the usefulness of the workshop, but agreed with the need to change the structure to bring a level of formality to it. Noting PNA’s comments, this CCM suggested integrating the HSW with the SC, to formalise a component of the work and recommendations. The Commission could instruct SC to reorganise to allow fisheries managers to attend. However, New Zealand also noted that the HSW/MOW provide an opportunity for free and frank exchange without the formality of SC."
WCPFC12,607,"EU noted that it would go with consensus on a compromise, and noted that the dialogue between scientists and managers is increasing in other RFMOs. EU considered that SC already does some of this work and will continue to do so in its intensive week of discussions each year, and this work assists the development of the Commission harvest strategies."
WCPFC12,608,"The Chair noted the support for continuation of the dialogue but not to have another workshop in the way it had been done previously, and the ABNJ project could support these discussions. The Chair noted that having the discussion at SC would mean that SC would need to also include managers, and there may be budget implications if managers were to add SC to their workload."
WCPFC12,609,"USA expressed the view that formality could be added to the workshops and thought it would not be practical for the managers to attend SC; SC’s role should be limited to evaluation. USA commented that SC could do more, coupled with a separate and informal meeting of managers, and that the workshop could be cut down by one day and held prior to the Commission meeting."
WCPFC12,610,"EU supported the USA proposal, agreeing that the role of SC and managers should be separated and that it was impractical for managers to attend SC."
WCPFC12,611,"RMI reiterated its earlier comment, supporting the work’s integration into SC and TCC. This CCM noted that it was difficult for small administrations to participate meaningfully in additional meetings and it was disruptive to have the workshop just before the Commission meeting."
WCPFC12,612,"Japan supported the USA’s suggestion, stating that this work required the participation of decision-makers and they may not necessarily go to SC. Japan supported the discussions taking place around the Commission meeting, and the Commission should have it on the agenda, to discuss species by species. China supported this view."
WCPFC12,613,"PNG supported RMI’s view, and noted that SC and TCC were subsidiary bodies whose discussions and recommendations are forwarded to the managers on which to take decisions."
WCPFC12,614,"The Cook Islands noted its experience was to separate participation at meetings, commenting that a meeting of managers to make the necessary commitments was important and a one day workshop prior to the Commission meeting was a worthy investment."
WCPFC12,615,EU reiterated its preferred option but supported Japan’s suggestion as a compromise.
WCPFC12,616,"Tokelau reiterated PNA members’ position. This CCM noted that several delegations did not send senior managers to the workshop this year but instead came to the Commission meeting with a set of positions that rendered efforts in the workshop useless. PNA members preferred, as a compromise, a one-day workshop after SC. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)83"
WCPFC12,617,"The Chair noted the lack of agreement, and suggested that no HSW/MOW be held in 2016 and instead the Commission continues these discussions, along with SC. There were no objections to this. The Chair expressed thanks to Cartwright for his work over four years."
WCPFC12,618,"The Commission agreed that there will not be a Management Objectives Workshop/Harvest Strategy Workshop in 2016, and the harvest strategy-related issues will be included on the WCPFC13 agenda in 2016. In addition, the Commission directed SC12 to include these discussions under the Management Issues theme agenda item, so that the discussion on harvest strategies, in particular, continues."
WCPFC12,619,The Commission adopted the report of the Harvest Strategy Workshop (WCPFC12-2015-23) and thanked Ian Cartwright for his work leading the MOW and HSW for the last four years. AGENDA ITEM 13 – ADOPTION OF FINAL COMPLIANCE MONITORING REPORT
WCPFC12,620,"The TCC Vice-Chair, presented the draft of the final CMS (as attached to the Summary Report of the TCC Special Session, WCPFC12-2015-19e), noting the cooperation and compromises that members had made in its compilation."
WCPFC12,621,Tokelau and Samoa sought clarification about their compliance status on an obligation relating to reporting on coastal state purse-seine limits under CMM 2014-07.
WCPFC12,622,The Compliance Manager explained that the reports had been received but the compliance issue that was noted related to a missed the Annual Report Part 2 deadline.
WCPFC12,623,"New Zealand made a general observation about the lengthy list of CCMs in the non-compliant category. It was noted that it included a wide range of non-compliance – for example, late reporting was in the same category as more severe compliance problems. This CCM commented that it was looking at the way these are differentiated as the Compliance Monitoring Scheme develops."
WCPFC12,624,"EU added to New Zealand’s comment, noting that the category is general, listing the country but not identifying the non-compliance. This CCM noted the tier scoring system used for data provision, which gives a non-compliance rating, and suggested a tier scoring might be explored to quantify the level of non-compliance in general."
WCPFC12,625,Philippines raised the idea of a rating system which gave a percentage to a CCM’s compliance.
WCPFC12,626,"The Chair reminded CCMs that the Final CMR is made up of the executive summary and two tables which each provide much detail and, taken together, form the background of the categorisations. The Chair noted the compliance monitoring measure was in development during this meeting and encouraged members to continue their work. The Chair thanked the TCC Vice-Chair for her efforts in preparing the final CMR."
WCPFC12,627,The Commission adopted the 2015 Final Compliance Monitoring Report. (Attachment W)   WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)84  AGENDA ITEM 14 – ADOPTION OF 2016 IUU VESSEL LIST
WCPFC12,628,The Commission considered the WCPFC 2016 IUU Vessel List for adoption. The Chair noted that one provisional vessel listing had not been resolved during initial discussions on the first day of the meeting and sought an update from Fiji on the issue of the FAIMANU V.
WCPFC12,629,"Fiji advised the Commission that after receiving notification from the authorities in Wallis and Futuna, through France, Fiji was satisfied with the sanctions imposed on the vessel owners, which it considered a deterrent to others. Fiji further advised that it did not wish to pursue the matter further and recommended the withdrawal of FAIMANU V from the Provisional WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC12,630,"Acknowledging Fiji’s statement, France expressed its gratitude to Fiji for the time and effort it had dedicated to the matter."
WCPFC12,631,"The Chair commented that as a result of that satisfactory resolution, there were no new nominations for the 2016 WCPFC IUU Vessel List. It was noted, however, that three vessels were currently on the list and the Secretariat was asked to provide any updates."
WCPFC12,632,"The Compliance Manager noted that a reply from Georgia had been received during WCPFC12, to a letter the Executive Director had sent post-TCC11. In this letter, Georgia had confirmed that the vessels NEPTUNE and FU LIEN No. 1 were no longer flagged to Georgia."
WCPFC12,633,"The Chair suggested that this be reflected in the final version of WCPFC IUU Vessel List, noting that it is not known what flag these vessels are currently flying. The ‘Current flag (previous flags)’ column of the list would read ‘unknown’ followed by ‘Georgia’."
WCPFC12,634,"EU noted that TCC11 had recommended seeking information from other RFMOs about vessels which had been on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for a long time. To give the issue more visibility, this CCM suggested a footnote reflecting this could be included into the list."
WCPFC12,635,The Commission adopted the 2016 WCPFC IUU Vessel List (Attachment X).
WCPFC12,636,"Australia expressed appreciation to those countries that cooperate in the area of surveillance and enforcement, particularly in relation to data sharing, noting that these activities underpin WCPFC’s management measures. Enforcement activities are costly, and sharing resources are necessary to ensure cost effective activities. This CCM encouraged countries to continue to share data and work cooperatively to respond to alleged IUU incidents in a manner that prevents them happening in the future, observing that IUU activities undermine the sustainability of stocks."
WCPFC12,637,"FSM supported Australia’s observation, advising that FSM continues to experience infractions of its Fisheries Act, including violations of territorial waters, by some members and CNMs. FSM noted that the Convention is clear on the need to combat IUU in all its forms, and called on members and CNMs to meet their flag state obligations. This CCM observed that MCS activities are a significant cost and called on Vietnam to meet the expectations of it as a CNM."
WCPFC12,638,"Vietnam advised the Commission that it had taken steps to resolve the issue referred to by FSM. On receipt of information about small boats entering FSM waters, a letter was sent from the Vietnam Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the FSM Embassy in Beijing. While the Vietnam Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet received information from the FSM authorities, Vietnam expressed to the Commission its strong commitment to resolving the issue. Vietnam assured the Commission and FSM that these small boats are considered to have violated both FSM and Vietnam’s laws and will be punished. Vietnam WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)85  nevertheless wants to point out that the small boats did not catch tuna, tuna-like or shark species, which precludes their listing on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. AGENDA ITEM 15 – ADOPTION OF NEW PROPOSALS"
WCPFC12,639,The Commission considered for adoption new proposals that were not addressed under species-specific agenda items. FFA proposal for Workplan for the adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06
WCPFC12,640,"On 8 December, Australia reported back on discussions through the week on WCPFC12-2015-DP09. Australia had received comments and had posted a revised draft of the harvest strategies work plan. The draft included an opening statement that describes the logic behind the plan and includes the revised timeline and levels of risk. Australia proposed that issues not agreed at WCPFC12 would be pushed into 2016, but otherwise remained unchanged."
WCPFC12,641,"The EU noted that it was important that this work was pursued, commenting that WCPFC is entering pioneering field, ahead of many RFMOs, by adopting harvest strategies. EU preferred to have started with stocks that are more compromised, such as BET, but accepted that this was a step-by-step process. It was noted that EU had contributed financially to this work and supported adoption of the work plan. This CCM expressed a preference that the target for the rebuilding plan for bigeye tuna was to rebuild the stock above BMSY in line with the objectives of the current tropical tuna measure. It also indicated that in particular in the absence of agreed TRP and in line with the Convention, the LRP should not be BMSY."
WCPFC12,642,"Indonesia supported the work plan, and stated that when Indonesia ratified the WCPFC Convention in 2013 it also attached a declaration that the Convention area did not cover certain Indonesian waters, noting that archipelagic waters play an important role in Indonesian fisheries – 320,000 tonnes of tuna is taken from these waters. Indonesia seeks to ensure measures within these waters are compatible with WCPFC measures, and understand this is their obligation under UNCLOS and the FSA. The WPEA project and other organisations had assisted the development of high seas fisheries for yellowfin and skipjack, with a plan to finish this work by 2017."
WCPFC12,643,"China noted that some difficulties remained with the draft and the new approach, noting that they needed time to adapt."
WCPFC12,644,"Japan commented that the work plan should make it clear what point is agreed or not agreed, noting that the TRP for skipjack had been agreed but not yellowfin, or acceptable levels of risk, and work was being pushed into the next year. Japan suggested more flexible tables."
WCPFC12,645,The Chair noted that the work plan was subject to decisions being taken by the Commission and if the Commission could not make those decisions then those issues would simply be moved to next year.
WCPFC12,646,"New Zealand supported the work plan and the concepts behind it, and noted that the Commission was still working on a measure looking at a yellowfin tuna interim risk level which would allow the science to continue apace, based on the structure in the work plan."
WCPFC12,647,"Australia supported 10% acceptable level of risk, on an interim basis. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)86"
WCPFC12,648,"EU supported this acceptable level of risk, and noted, regarding Japan and China’s concerns, that the Commission was agreeing a process with the work plan, which was a living doc, with some elements not yet perfect. This CCM reminded the Commission that the importance of the HSW/MOW was as a forum to discuss some of these details."
WCPFC12,649,"Japan noted that the Commission had agreed a skipjack TRP and a task to SC for the bigeye tuna rebuilding plan, but acceptable levels of risk for yellowfin and skipjack was not yet agreed or the management objectives for skipjack. This CCM noted that it was not ready to adopt the table as proposed, asking for more substantial discussion on each item to decide meaningful and effective ones. Japan was not optimistic that the work plan was flexible, noting that once it was decided it would have a serious impact on the fisheries."
WCPFC12,650,"USA supported the adoption of the work plan, noting that a significant amount of work had gone into the work plan and, as EU had stated, it was a living document. The dates were flexible as were other aspects, allowing the Commission to continue developing the harvest strategies."
WCPFC12,651,"Australia referred to CMM 2014-06 adopted last year which describes the elements these discussions were working towards. This CCM explained that the work plan was a practical tool to set out the work which the Commission agreed to do in that CMM. The work plan was not intended to lock anything in, in a permanent way, or bind the Commission to certain dates. Rather, it was supposed to reflect a genuine endeavour to tackle the work. Australia noted that the way the work plan was drafted reflects the language in CMM 2014-06, and the substantive elements that go towards the Commission harvest strategies are decided separately to the work plan, which was simply a plan. Australia reiterated that the work plan was flexible and elements can be shuffled around if necessary; it included language to provide comfort around these issues."
WCPFC12,652,"New Zealand noted that there was no advance in the discussion around risk levels, and advised that it had been working with interested members to consider a proposal for interim risk level for yellowfin tuna and proposed to circulate some suggested text to advance the science process.  This was subsequently circulated as WCPFC12-2015-DP27, but was not further discussed."
WCPFC12,653,The Chair asked for an update on the recording of management objectives for skipjack and albacore.
WCPFC12,654,"In response to further concerns from China, the Chair noted that WCPFC12-2015-DP09 was just a plan, and it was flexible. The Chair asked if the Commission could agree to the draft, noting that what was not agreed at this meeting will simply be moved to 2016. The Chair preferred to not have substantive discussions on the actual elements at this stage, just that the draft workplan be adopted and certain elements be moved forward to 2016."
WCPFC12,655,"Japan and China supported this, with Japan reiterating matters the Commission could not agree at WCPFC12 should be deferred to 2016."
WCPFC12,656,"The Chair thanked Australia for its hard work in advancing this difficult work through the Commission, noting that the Commission had a lot on its plate for 2016."
WCPFC12,657,The Commission adopted the workplan for the adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 (Attachment Y). The Commission tasked the SC with support from the Scientific Service Provider to undertake the activities specified in the agreed workplan.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)87  FFA proposal for management of enclosed and semi-enclosed high seas areas
WCPFC12,658,"FFA members reported on progress on WCPFC12-2015-DP05, a proposal for additional MCS measures for certain high seas areas. Consultations had been held with some delegations, and there were some red lines on this proposal as well as support, subject to various qualifiers such as improving transparency."
WCPFC12,659,The Chair noted that there was not agreement on this proposal.
WCPFC12,660,"New Caledonia made a statement regarding entry to and exit from its EEZ. New Caledonia noted the FFA proposal which aimed to increasing the monitoring of vessels which enter the EEZs of coastal states, and reminded the Commission that at WCPFC7, entry and exit notification for all the EEZs covered by the Convention was proposed. This proposal was not accepted but the WCPFC7 summary report (para. 404) suggested it could be addressed through national legislation. Accordingly, New Caledonia implemented such a provision in 2011 and was currently preparing an amendment to extend reporting fields to the catch on board when the vessel is entering or leaving New Caledonia’s EEZ. New Caledonia stated that it will not hinder the right of transit of any ships under UNCLOS; the measure is taken under Article 73, para. 1 of UNCLOS to ensure compliance with a coastal state’s fisheries regulations; it brings consistency between the requirements of licensed vessels to provide detailed information and non-licensed vessels. This CCM noted that the entry/exit declaration for its EEZ is not optional, and not making one is a severe infringement; catch on board may be regarded as having been caught in the New Caledonia EEZ. New Caledonia reminded the Commission of the creation in 2014 of the Natural Park of the Coral Sea, which covers the whole EEZ and, consequently, waters within the Convention area. This CCM noted that a management plan for this park was in development and wished to build it in cooperation with its neighbours.  FFA proposal for enhanced port-based MCS measures"
WCPFC12,661,"FFA members reported on their proposal in WCPFC12-2015-DP10, relating to port-based MCS measures. After consultations in the margins of this meeting, and despite support from several CCMs and observer organizations, FFA members reported that one CCM’s position meant the proposal was unable to progress. These members will continue to develop port state measures within the FFA framework, and FFA asked that CCMs consult with them on elements which need to be changed."
WCPFC12,662,"EU noted that it would have preferred to move towards FAO standards but commended FFA’s efforts this year and supported their proposal. This CCM saw this proposal as the first step in the right direction towards FAO standards. This CCM expressed disappointment that for the third year in a row a proposal for port state measures was not adopted, and hoped the Commission would do so as soon as possible."
WCPFC12,663,USA noted that port inspection measures are important to ensure sustainability because they help ensure that seafood entering the market has not been illegally harvested. This CCM hoped the Commission will progress next year on this important issue.
WCPFC12,664,"Japan noted that it had stated its position for the last two year on the FAO Port State Measures Agreement, and commented that domestic discussions were still underway on this issue. In relation to the proposal, Japan noted that it had contacted FFA and discussed it in detail, including the intention of some of the provisions of the draft proposal in the margin of the meeting. This CCM considered that some areas needed further clarification, exchanges of information and views, and further internal review. Therefore this CCM had not been able to accept this proposal at WCPFC12. Japan was happy to discuss a new proposal along the same lines as the CCSBT scheme adopted at the last CCSBT meeting. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)88"
WCPFC12,665,"Korea noted that port state measures play a part in the fight against IUU fishing, as a gatekeeper preventing IUU catch flowing into the market and the FFA proposal was welcome in this regard. Korea noted that it participates in port state measures through various channels and port-based inspections that are more stringent than the FAO Port State Measures Agreement. Korea stated that it was ready to make a meaningful contribution to the introduction of port state measures which take into account the needs of SIDS."
WCPFC12,666,"Pew, Humane Society International, WWF and Greenpeace expressed their disappointment and noted that this was the sixth Commission meeting at which port state measures has been considered for adoption. These organizations noted that WCPFC remains one of the RFMOs lacking a minimum scheme of port controls, and commented that port state measures are one of the most effective tools to prevent the entry of illegally-caught fish into the world’s markets and a measure would significantly strengthen WCPFC’s management regime. These organizations urged members to take the necessary steps to ensure adoption of minimum standards for port inspections is not delayed further and can be adopted at WCPFC13."
WCPFC12,667,"Chinese Taipei generally supported the proposal, but noted that some members have difficulties due to domestic issues, which it encouraged to resolve as soon as possible and come back next year and reach an agreement."
WCPFC12,668,The Chair noted the general support to have a port state measure in place and strongly encouraged those members with difficulties to make progress next year. USA proposed revisions to VMS SSPs related to ALC type approval
WCPFC12,669,"On 5 December, the USA advised that there was a new version of the VMS SSPs proposal posted shortly (WCPFC12-2015-DP13_rev1). USA briefly highlighted some changes which had been made to the initial proposal during negotiations in the margins of WCPFC12. The approval/disapproval process was no longer solely a Secretariat function, there were now roles for TCC and the Commission. And if an ALC type is removed, flag states will have a two-year window to change to approved types."
WCPFC12,670,"Japan noted TCC’s concern about at least 41 vessels that were not reporting to the Commission VMS and agreed that it needed to be addressed, but took the view that the replacement should be when the unit would naturally be replaced, as new ALCs are very expensive, which is large financial burden for fishermen, especially small-scale fishermen despite there was no fault of them."
WCPFC12,671,"EU preferred a one year replacement window and thought this was feasible. EU supported USA’s changes, noting that without the timeframe a lot of the meaning behind the amendment is lost."
WCPFC12,672,"FFA members thanked USA for working intersessionally on the proposal and supported the revisions, noting that they would strengthen the WCPFC ALC approval process and enable the Secretariat to remove ALC makes and models that no longer meet the minimum standards of the Commission VMS from the approved list."
WCPFC12,673,"Australia supported the USA proposal. Australia understood Japan’s position and recognised the need to give fleets time. This CCM had no practical concerns with the delay in implementation, however Australia urged Japan to consider a timeframe."
WCPFC12,674,A lengthy discussion took place around a timeframe. Japan reiterated its preference for the units to be replaced when the next installation of the unit takes place but was able to be flexible on a 5 year timeframe. Some CCMs wanted the timeframe to be no later than one or two years. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)89
WCPFC12,675,Japan and the USA agreed to discuss the timeframe in the margins. The agenda item remained open.
WCPFC12,676,"On behalf of The Pew Charitable Trusts, HSI, WWF, Greenpeace, SFP and ISSF, Pew thanked USA but expressed concern and disappointment at the lack of consensus on the timeframe for replacing non-type approved ALCs, as it represents an important standard for enhancing the VMS SSPs. These organizations noted that VMS was critically important for vessel monitoring in high seas areas within the Convention area but stated that the VMS CMM and SSPs needed to be improved, particularly around manual reporting. These organizations noted that manual reporting was established to provide vessels with a backup means of position reporting, but commented that it allows vessels to stay out at sea, unmonitored, for up to 45 days, especially if there is no observer onboard. The Secretariat’s 2014 VMS annual report indicates that 100 fishing and carrier vessels provided 2,044 manual reports in the first eight months of 2014, on the basis that their VMS unit malfunctioned or failed. Assuming a reporting rate of every 6 hours, those manual reports amounted to roughly 511 days of vessel time. With fisheries observer coverage for some longline fleets falling short of the 5% coverage, these organizations noted that this vessel time is almost completely unverifiable. It was observed that the FFA type approval process for VMS units has ensured the phasing out of problematic VMS units for vessels on the FFA Vessel Register, curbing high levels of manual reporting by these vessels. These organizations commented that the Commission should move towards establishing similar standards to limit manual reporting and assist in ensuring verifiability. They encouraged CCMs to adopt the USA proposal and to seek to improve the VMS CMM and SSPs going forward, particularly by reducing the time during which vessels are authorized to manually report when the VMS unit has malfunctioned or is inoperable."
WCPFC12,677,"Later in the meeting, further discussions on this issue took place, with two changes: a change of wording from ‘ALC’ to ‘instrument’ and, more substantively, a proposal for the replacement period of non-approved ALCs of ‘no more than three years’."
WCPFC12,678,The Commission agreed to the amendments to the VMS SSPs related to ALC-type approval procedures (Attachment Z) Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS) CMM
WCPFC12,679,"On 5 December 2015 the TCC Vice-Chair reported that the CMS measure SWG had discussed the amendments and required a further meeting. On 7 December, another meeting took place with interested participants with a view to agreeing a draft for CCMs to consider."
WCPFC12,680,"On 8 December, the TCC Vice-Chair reported to plenary that parties had made compromises and WCPFC12-2015-20_rev5 was ready for discussions with a view to adoption."
WCPFC12,681,The Chair asked if the Commission was ready to adopt the measure as amended.
WCPFC12,682,"EU noted that it had participated in the intersessional work on the measure and admitted that there was a sense of engaging something without knowing the impacts, given the extensive revisions to the measure, and the inclusion of some very new and untested concepts. This CCM commented that if there was consensus they would not block the adoption of the measure, as it understood its main intent, but expressed its concerns about how CCMs would be able to provide reasons that they cannot be assessed against an obligation because of capacity constraints, and how implementation plans that run for a certain number of years, would be applied in practice. EU noted that these plans should be reviewed by TCC to evaluate progress. However, EU noted that deciding not to assess a CCM against an obligation was an important decision, and the process needs to be tight to avoid possible abuse. This CCM also raised the issue of the possible financial implications of the proposal which are difficult to anticipate.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)90"
WCPFC12,683,"The Chair drew the Commission’s attention to paras. 26 and 27 which were not yet agreed, on the issues of the review panel and review time period."
WCPFC12,684,"The TCC Vice-Chair noted that the majority of the SWG participants were comfortable with the two-year timeframe, noting that there were major changes to the measure. Others wanted the measure to be reviewed in 2018 and revised in 2019."
WCPFC12,685,"USA expressed appreciation to the current and past Chairs and Vice-Chairs of TCC for developing the proposal, noting that the CMS had gone through a series of one-year measures, that there was a need for the measure to be revised and take into account fairness and capacity building, and the need for the measure to develop the Commission’s capacity to comply with the measures that are in place. This CCM noted that the Commission can do all the science and analysis but it is meaningless if the Commission cannot comply with the measures in place. The new measure needs the opportunity to function, to be put in place, to see how it works, how it is implemented, whether it achieves its goals. The USA continued to take the view that the CMS measure should be permanent, though in an attempt to find common ground would agree for the new measure to be in place for three years before being subject to a independent review panel selected by the Executive Director. This CCM took the view that the measure should be in place for at least two years before it is reviewed, so it can be experienced well before an assessment is attempted and before changes are made."
WCPFC12,686,"Australia noted the good progress at this meeting. This CCM noted the time and effort involved in assessing compliance but noted that these were valuable discussions for the Commission and increased understanding.  It further noted the value of the measure in highlighting where improvements can be made to CMMs. This CCM saw value in a measure that went beyond one year, and saw value in a review of the measure."
WCPFC12,687,Japan preferred the measure to be effective for 2016 and 2017 only. This CCM noted the substantial efforts on the draft but commented that the two very new concepts incorporated in the measure have unknown impacts. Japan took the view that the measure should be implemented on an experimental basis of two years only.
WCPFC12,688,"Several CCMs supported a measure that was effective for 2016 and 2017, including New Zealand, noting that TCC11 found that there were substantial process issues – for example, the introduction of observer reports to the process – which proved extremely useful but were new issues."
WCPFC12,689,"USA reiterated that its strong preference was for a permanent measure, and noted that two years was not a compromise, but that it stood alone on this. The USA also suggested that the review be conducted by a group of people which were selected by the Executive Director but with the members helping select that panel."
WCPFC12,690,"The Chair noted that there was general agreement that the measure would apply for 2016 and 2017 only, and the outstanding issue was whether the review would be conducted by an independent panel or whether the mechanism of the review would be left for TCC to determine."
WCPFC12,691,"RMI suggested keeping the review within the purview of TCC, and how TCC determines how to do that is up to TCC."
WCPFC12,692,"After some time for delegations to consult, late on 8 December the Chair asked if any progress had been made on the outstanding issue of the independent review.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)91"
WCPFC12,693,"USA noted that the issue of having an independent review of the measure had been discussed on a number of occasions, including at WCPFC11 and TCC11. This CCM stated that having such a review would help the Commission strengthen the measure, and it should be done after letting the measure work and having data to evaluate. With the lack of consensus so far in the meeting, the USA expressed the view that if a review is not able to be included in the measure itself at WCPFC12, the meeting report should include a commitment by the Commission to conduct a review after it has been allowed to run for a couple of years."
WCPFC12,694,"Given lack of agreement on aspects of the independent review, a lengthy discussion took place regarding the report language on the timing of the review and who would complete the work."
WCPFC12,695,The Commission adopted CMM 2015-07 Conservation and Management Measure for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (Attachment aa)
WCPFC12,696,"Subject to the recommendations from TCC12 (CMM 2015-07, para 40) a review of the CMS will be conducted by an independent panel selected by the Executive Director in consultation with Members at the end of 2017."
WCPFC12,697,"The Chair thanked the TCC Chair and Vice-Chair for their work developing the amended CMS CMM, noting that it was a significant accomplishment for the Commission. Transshipment"
WCPFC12,698,"When plenary reconvened on this issue, RMI noted that efforts had continued from TCC11 and take into consideration work done at the IWG-ROP and the PNA proposal. Given the impracticability issues in para. 34 and concerns about para. 35 (lack of reporting, manual reporting, VMS issues), para. 37 sets out minimum guidelines for certain vessels to tranship in waters under national jurisdiction. This CCM proposed a complete ban on high seas transshipment other than purse-seine vessels as stipulated in para. 34, noting the impracticability of the associated paras. 35 and 37."
WCPFC12,699,"EU reiterated its concerns about the application of the transshipment measure, which is supposed to be an exception not the rule. EU encouraged RMI to count on its full support for a measure next year."
WCPFC12,700,"In response to the Chair's query about whether to consider para. 34 in CMM 2009-06, or tasking TCC to consider it in some way, PNG noted that in 2006, 2007 and 2008 FFA put forward proposals banning transshipment on the high seas, and these proposals are still on the table. These could be a basis for the start of that discussion."
WCPFC12,701,"FFA members noted that after these proposals were not adopted, FFA sought a more collegial approach in 2009 through guidelines that flag states would use to allow some ongoing high seas transhipment where there was no alternative, but opined that flag states have not implemented that compromise in good faith, with a blanket exemptions of most of the high seas fleet and no effort to reduce high seas transhipments. FFA members noted that it was possible for high seas longline vessels to operate without transhipping – for example the EU longline fleet – and requested the review of para. 34 of CMM 2009-06, particularly the criteria for assessing ‘impracticability’, as a means to tighten controls and move more transhipment activities into ports. FFA members requested that analysis of transhipment activities using the VMS Transhipment Analysis Tool be provided in subsequent annual reports. These CCMs expressed support for the timely provision of transhipment information in the annual report on WCPFC high seas transhipment. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)92"
WCPFC12,702,"The Cook Islands noted that in 2010, it established a Special Management Area for the high seas pockets, and since then has called for more stringent management of high seas area including a transshipment ban. This CCM noted that coastal states will think about implementing legislation to address this issue, and noted that the Cook Islands sees the issue as coming under its licence conditions."
WCPFC12,703,"Japan opined that the chapeau part of CMM 2009-06 states that the Commission recognizes that transshipment is a common global practice. Japan stated that it could not go along with a simple request for a high seas transshipment ban. This CCM understood some CCMs’ concerns about IUU activities, and for this reason Japan supported increasing the traceability of the transshipments."
WCPFC12,704,The Chair asked the Commission about further work.
WCPFC12,705,"RMI noted that a draft guideline was prepared a couple of years back but was not adopted. This CCM was firmly of the view that, notwithstanding that transhipping is a global practice, a simple fix is to impose para. 34. RMI commented that it was not asking for amendments, but for implementation of the measure."
WCPFC12,706,"Korea noted that the observers help ensure compliance, commenting that transshipment was a necessary practice, especially for longline vessels, as making them come back to port creates an operational burden. This CCM opined that the Commission needs to strike the balance between compliance, conservation and operational stability."
WCPFC12,707,"The Chair noted that the views are quite clear, and there remains the circular nature of the discussion between the Commission and the TCC, which is not being resolved. The Chair encouraged CCMs to keep the discussions going in the different forums within the Commission and work on ways to bridge the gaps so the Commission can progress next year."
WCPFC12,708,"USA noted the importance of the issue, and the RMI proposal was very constructive."
WCPFC12,709,"FSM supported FFA’s comments and thanked RMI for taking the lead, commenting that these fleets targets one of the stocks that is in trouble."
WCPFC12,710,RMI requested that Legal Adviser advise on para. 34 as a basis for the work going forward.
WCPFC12,711,"The Legal Adviser opined that para. 34 makes it clear that there should be no transshipment except where the CCM has determined that for certain vessels it is impracticable to operate without being able to transship on the high seas. Para. 37 allows for guidelines to be developed and for these to be agreed by TCC and submitted to the Commission. The Legal Advisor noted that no such guidelines have been submitted. Para. 37 noted that the guidelines set out in the rest of the paragraph shall apply in determining the practicability: 1) whether the prohibition of transshipment on the high seas would cause a significant economic hardship, which is to be assessed in terms of the costs that would be incurred and 2) whether the vessel would have to make significant or substantial changes to its historical way of operating. The Legal Advisor opined that this part of para. 37 combined with the language in para. 34 provide a high threshold before a CCM could determine that a ban on high seas transshipment would be impracticable. If a CCM has made such a determination and has notified that to the Secretariat, then the CCM responsible for offloading and receiving shall advise the Commission of the producers of the monitoring of the transshipment and will submit to the Commission a plan outlining what it is doing to encourage the vessel to come to port. In summary, these paragraphs ensure that there is a high threshold and sets out rules about the procedure to be taken in those circumstances. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)93"
WCPFC12,712,"The EU noted that it was clear that the measure as currently drafted gives a possibility to transship at sea as an exception with a very high threshold of criteria to be met to allow the transshipment. TCC heard about the large number of vessels that notified for transhipment, and they were basically all longliners. EU noted that even if it was impractical for its fleet to tranship in port and it has financial implications, they do it so they are the proof that it is feasible. This CCM stated that the measure was clear, and it is the application of the measure that is the problem. EU commented that it would move forward with RMI on this issue."
WCPFC12,713,"RMI noted that the exceptions were discussed extensively at TCC, and there were problems in terms of compliance. The problem with the measure is that it provides for the exemptions."
WCPFC12,714,"USA recalled that the Commission has discussed paras. 34-38 on previous occasions and has impressed upon the Secretariat to do the work that is called for in para. 37 – developing the further guidelines. This CCM stated that it was necessary to do that work so that the USA is assured that its vessels are on the same playing field as others. This CCM commented that if countries have made the notification, arguably they are compliant, but noted the way forward hinged on the Executive Director providing the guidelines."
WCPFC12,715,"China commented that it tries its best to encourage its fleet to go to port to unload product caught on the high seas but it is practically difficult due to operational costs and conflicts between SIDS’ domestic laws and WCPFC laws, especially around shark species, which provide for no harvesting and no transportation of shark products, making its fleet hesitant to go to port. China commented that some SIDS have increased their port costs. In addition, China noted that many SIDS ports do not have facilities for handling deep frozen product. Through joint ventures, China is seeking to improve these facilities, but the Commission needs to understand the practical problems. For these reasons, China stated that it is hard to persuade their ships to tranship in ports, but China will work with RMI to find a solution."
WCPFC12,716,The Chair noted there was some agreement to revive the request to the Executive Director to draft guidelines as per para. 37 for the TCC to consider in 2016.
WCPFC12,717,"Japan also proposed that para. 13 be reviewed and, if possible, revised."
WCPFC12,718,"Noting paragraph 37 of CMM 2009-06, the Commission tasked the Executive Director to prepare draft guidelines for the determination of circumstances where it is impracticable for certain vessels to tranship in port or in waters under national jurisdiction. TCC12 is tasked to consider these guidelines, and amend as necessary, and recommend them to the Commission for adoption in 2016. The Commission agreed that paragraph 13 should be considered as part of this tasking. EU proposal for amendment of Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission."
WCPFC12,719,"EU advised that during discussions several delegations felt that the Commission should hear from the SC on this issue. Consequently, EU commented that it would not be presenting the amendments for adoption but sought to task SC12 with providing advice and recommendations. EU wanted to work intersessionally with interested CCMs then have a discussion at SC and also TCC as one of the main purposes of the changes is to help the TCC to do its work in interpreting some of the obligations. EU advised that it would come to WCPFC13 with a consolidated proposal."
WCPFC12,720,The Chair sought to clarify whether the Commission wanted to task the subsidiary bodies so that the work continues next year.
WCPFC12,721,"EU and USA favoured this suggestion, with Australia supporting the SC’s review. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)94"
WCPFC12,722,"The Commission noted TCC recommendations paragraphs 486–488 which are recommendations from the CMS process to revise the Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission decision, and the corresponding proposal by the European Union (WCPFC12-2015-DP17) (Attachment v)."
WCPFC12,723,The Commission agreed that SC12 should review the elements in Attachment bb and provide advice and recommendations. AGENDA ITEM 16 – REPORT OF THE NINTH FINANCE AND  ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE 16.1 Report of the Ninth Finance and Administration Committee
WCPFC12,724,"P. Callaghan (USA) presented the recommendations included in the report of the Ninth Session of the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC9), which was convened by Co-Chairs J. Samuelu Ah-Leong (Samoa) and P. Callaghan (USA) (WCPFC12-2015-24). FAC9 met on 2, 5, 7 and 8 December 2015, during WCPFC12. It was noted that one issue remained unresolved in the budget, referred to in para. 66 of the FAC9 report, relating to funding for Project 67 on skipjack range contraction. A minority at FAC9 did not support keeping it in the budget as they were concerned about getting value out of the USD40,000 allocated, particularly when the details of the work remained unclear."
WCPFC12,725,The Chair thanked Samuelu Ah-Leong and Callaghan for their leadership through a difficult FAC meeting.
WCPFC12,726,"Japan commented that range contraction and local depletion issues were very difficult for island communities, including Japan and those in the Pacific. This CCM noted there is a reason for SC tasked to refer to range contraction and local depletion issues after adoption of the initial TRP of skipjack tuna, and hoped the project would be retained in the budget."
WCPFC12,727,"WWF gave a statement on behalf of ISSF, WWF, the Pew Charitable Trusts and Humane Society International as organisations which participate in the work of the Commission and represent stakeholders ranging from civil society to consumers. These observer organizations commented that, in principle, they were not opposed to a study about the costs of participation in the Commission or to making a reasonable contribution to support their participation. However, if observer organisations are to be required to pay a fee toward the meeting costs, these organizations expect that their participation will not be unduly constrained, including their participation in all meetings and access to all materials in accordance with Article 21 of the WCPF Convention and the Rules of Procedure. These organizations strongly encouraged the review to be undertaken in consultation with observers and recommended the following be considered: the purpose for charging observers a participation fee, ways to account for the participation of observer organizations with smaller and/or differing resource capacities, other options for addressing concerns about the Commission budget, the fees charged in other tuna RFMOs, and ways to strengthen the participation and contributions of observers across the full spectrum of Commission work. 16.2 Budget approval for 2016 and indicative budgets for 2017 and 2018"
WCPFC12,728,"The Commission considered for adoption the WCPFC budget for 2016 and indicative budgets for 2017 and 2018, as submitted by Finance and Administration Committee, which met during WCPFC12."
WCPFC12,729,"The Commission adopted the Report of the Ninth Session of the FAC (WCPFC12-2015-24, Attachment cc) and an eventual Commission budget for 2016 of 7,731,994 USD (Attachment dd). WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)95  AGENDA ITEM 17 – ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS 17.1 Strategic Plan"
WCPFC12,730,"The Executive Director presented a formal submission to review the current planning framework of the Commission and the Secretariat and to develop a planning framework that includes a long term, high level strategic plan, a shorter-term corporate (or business) plan and the annual work programme (WCPFC12-2015-25). The current strategic plan, adopted in 2010 at WCPF7, covered the period 2011-2013. In 2013, at WCPFC10, the Secretariat tabled an updated Strategic Plan 2014-2016 (which also incorporated the work plans developed at SC9 and TCC9), but views were mixed, with some CCMs considering the plan as more of a short term business plan rather than a forward looking vision for the Commission’s aspirations on the status of stocks and the flow of fisheries benefits. The Secretariat was directed to re-table it in Apia, Samoa for WCPFC11’s consideration, however there was no discussion on it. The current planning framework consists of a strategic plan of 3 year duration and an annual work plan which are not aligned. The Executive Director proposed for a review of the planning framework and to develop the planning documentation that set high-level strategic objectives for the Commission and clearly demarcate the roles of the Commission and those of Secretariat. The Executive Director mentioned that there will be opportunities for members to provide input to the planning documents as the process proposed to develop those plans are is transparent and consultative. A draft terms of reference attached to the working paper contains timelines and key tasks to be undertaken, budget implications, and a tasking to report back to WCPFC13. A budget of $69,500 is estimated to cover the costs expected in the TOR which includes a consultant to facilitate the process and travel costs, and the cost of holding a two day meeting in conjunction with TCC. WCPFC12 was invited to approve the review of the Commission’s planning framework and the development of a new Strategic Plan and a new Corporate Plan in accordance with the terms of reference in Annex 1 of the working paper."
WCPFC12,731,"FFA members welcomed the proposal, noting that it responds to their requests over several years for reform of the Commission’s strategic planning process, to better focus its core business and concentrate attention on certain issues. These CCMs approved the proposed timetable, and invited the consultant, when he or she is appointed, to the annual Forum Fisheries Committee meeting in Vanuatu in May 2016, to facilitate initial consultations with FFA members. FFA hoped a decision on the review and the work to be completed can be made at WCPFC12, so FAC9 can take it into account in the budget."
WCPFC12,732,"Japan noted that the proposal was for a 10-15 year strategy but observed that the Commission discussed the tropical tuna measure for 3 years and the work has not been achieved. Thus, this CCM wondered if the Commission could adopt a 10-15 year plan, which covers everything. Japan further stated that the main issues expected to be included in the plan are already described in the Convention. This CCM questioned the value of budget expenditure for the consultancy and commented that the Commission should work on issues to be really done within limited budget."
WCPFC12,733,PNG noted that separating management from operations was important.
WCPFC12,734,The Commission approved the review of the WCPFC planning framework and the development of a new Strategic Plan and a new Corporate Plan in Attachment dd.   WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)96  17.2 Research projects 17.2.1 ABNJ Project
WCPFC12,735,"A. Anganuzzi, Global Coordinator of the GEF-funded, FAO-implemented ABNJ (Common Oceans) Tuna Project, provided a report on recent progress under the project (WCPFC12-2015-26). Partners in the project include all of the tuna RFMOs, as well as IGOs, regional organizations, NGOs and the private sector. The first project component relates to strengthening fisheries management including support for meetings on harvest strategies (e.g. the HSW), science-management dialogues, and the ecosystem approach to fisheries. The second project component relates to MCS and reducing IUU fishing. It includes work on MCS best practices and training curricula, in conjunction with FFA, a global database of authorised fishing vessels, legal templates for Port State Measures; electronic monitoring trials (for example in Fiji), and best practices for catch documentation schemes, which were presented at the CDS-IWG in September. The third project component relates to reducing the impacts of tuna fisheries on the ecosystem. The WCPFC is the tuna RFMO focal point for the shark activities under this component, hosting the project’s Technical Coordinator – Sharks and Bycatch (Dr Shelley Clarke) within the Secretariat in Pohnpei. Work under the third component includes collaboration between WCPFC and IATTC on shark data improvement and assessment, enhancing the Bycatch Management Information System, trials to reduce seabird mortality and purse-seine bycatch, and work in the northern Indian Ocean on bycatch in gillnet fisheries. Members’ ongoing participation in, and support for, the ABNJ Tuna Project was gratefully acknowledged."
WCPFC12,736,The Chair thanked Anganuzzi for his presentation and the project’s continued support of the Commission. Interested participants were referred to WCPFC12-2015-26 for more information.
WCPFC12,737,"The FFA Secretariat thanked FAO and the ABNJ project for funding assistance, particularly for MCS training it had facilitated in the region. It was noted that the second MCS Officer Foundation Course had been recently concluded, for which the FAO funding had been very useful. This course provided participants with university qualifications for officers seeking career paths in MCS."
WCPFC12,738,The Commission noted the progress report on the ABNJ project. 17.2.2 WPEA Project
WCPFC12,739,"The WCPFC Science Manager provided an update on the WPEA project (WCPFC12-2015-27), noting that 25% of the WCPFC tuna catch is caught in the WPEA project area. The new GEF funded WPEA Project (Sustainable Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the West Pacific and East Asian Seas) has three components: 1) governance for building regional and national adaptive capacity of Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam in the management of highly migratory stocks, 2) implementation of policy, institutional and fishery management reform, and 3) knowledge sharing. Key activities include data collection (both target and bycatch) from port sampling, landed catch, logbook, VMS, and observer programme and annual tuna catch estimation, capacity building in science, compliance and management, development of specific guidelines on adaptive management and monitoring against the impact of climate change; market-based sustainable harvests through tuna supply chain analysis and eco-labelling and/or certification; development of reference points, harvest strategy and sub-regional stock assessment; and ecosystem approach to fisheries management guiding sustainable harvest of the oceanic tuna stock and reduced by-catch of sea turtles, sharks and seabirds."
WCPFC12,740,The Philippines expressed its appreciation for WCPFC’s assistance and P.Williams (SPC) for helping improving the quality of the data that Philippines provides to the Commission. This CCM agreed that there was a lot of work to be done but noted that the WPEA project helps them perform their duties WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)97  as a Commission member and the capacity building it provides helps the Philippines delegation to actively participate. The Philippines hoped the Commission continues to support the project.
WCPFC12,741,"Echoing this request for support for the project, Indonesia noted the tangible improvements in catch estimates and capacity building it had provided."
WCPFC12,742,"Vietnam express its gratitude to the Commission and to the GEF for the support provided, noting that the project had greatly improved data collection and analysis, with the Commission now receiving higher quality data from Vietnam as a result. This CCM thanked the Science Manager and SPC and hoped for further strengthened support of the Commission."
WCPFC12,743,"FFA members noted that data provision from the fisheries in these countries is poor but their catch is significant.  FFA support the project because these data gaps in the stock assessments impact on the scientific work of the Commission. These CCMs noted that neither Vietnam nor Indonesia has provided, or authorised the release of, their operational- and aggregate-level data to the Commission, and strongly urged them to address this as a matter of priority."
WCPFC12,744,The Commission noted the report on the progress of the WPEA project. 17.3 Election of officers
WCPFC12,745,The Commission appointed Paul Callaghan (USA) to continue as Co-Chair of the FAC.
WCPFC12,746,The Commission appointed Aisake Batibasaga (Fiji) to be Vice-Chair of the Scientific Committee.  17.4 Future meetings
WCPFC12,747,"The Commission agreed that:  • SC12 would be held in from Wednesday 3 – Thursday 11 August 2016 in Bali, Indonesia • NC12 would be held for 5 days on a date to be confirmed in September 2016 in Japan • TCC12 would be held from Wednesday 21 September – Tuesday 27 September 2016 in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia.  • WCPFC13 would be held from Monday 5 – Friday 9 December 2016 in Fiji  • FAC10 would be held immediately prior to WCPFC13."
WCPFC12,748,"The Commission also agreed that three intersessional working groups would hold meetings in 2016, as follows:  • CDS-IWG, which would meet immediately prior to TCC12 • FADMgmtOptions-IWG would meet immediately following TCC12 • ERandEM-IWG on dates to be confirmed, preferably prior to SC12.  WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)98"
WCPFC12,749,"The ERandEM-IWG Chair noted that one set of possible dates which had been discussed with the FFA was for the meeting to be held in March 2016 back-to-back with FFA Monitoring, Control and Surveillance Working Group in Auckland, New Zealand, and that these would be confirmed in due course."
WCPFC12,750,"RMI noted that the growth in size of Commission meetings restricts the venues at which they can be held, and for many Pacific Island countries it was impossible to host a Commission meeting. This CCM congratulated Fiji for hosting WCPFC13. AGENDA ITEM 18 – OTHER MATTERS 18.1 Update on WCPFC VMS"
WCPFC12,751,"The Compliance Manager and the Deputy Director General of the FFA, W. Norris, presented WCPFC12-2015-29, an update on the status of the Commission VMS. The Compliance Manager noted the purpose of the agenda item was to update the Commission on changes to the Commission VMS system which would take place in 2016. The working paper outlined the process which FFA undertook to change its VMS service provider, and the background to this decision including participation by the WCPFC Secretariat in the tender process. The Commission VMS is provided by FFA under a Service Level Agreement. Currently almost 3500 vessels report to the Commission VMS. The cost to the Commission of the system has remained stable in recent years at around $400,000 per annum (para. 9). Other costs include those for airtime services, training and redundancy."
WCPFC12,752,"The Deputy Director General of the FFA advised the Commission about the tender process FFA undertook in 2015 to test the market for alternative VMS providers. This was done for a number of reasons: a) the current VMS provider had been the provider for 5 years and it is good business practice to test the market, b) the cost of the current service provider was seen by FFA as too high and c) FFA were concerned that the VMS technology was not being developed by the current provider at the pace they wanted. The tender review panel, on which the WCPFC Secretariat sat, met three times in 2013-2014. During this time the panel reviewed the expressions of interest and created a shortlist, invited the three shortlisted firms to present and then provided a recommend to the FFA Executive. That went to the decision making body of the FFA, the Forum Fisheries Committee, in May 2015 and FFA received approval to change service providers. The new provider is Trackwell, an Icelandic company which provides VMS services to a number of fisheries agencies. WCPFC has been given formal notice of the change and meetings are planned to assist the technical work of transitioning to the new system and ensure the project plan is in place."
WCPFC12,753,"The Compliance Manager noted that FFA will switch over to the new system a little earlier than WCPFC and the Secretariat is taking steps to make sure that when the Commission switches over, all the boats that can be seen on one system are also seen on the other system. FFA has arranged for services through the current VMS to continue until 30 June 2015 after which WCPFC plans to have transitioned fully to the Trackwell system. Members will receive advice on this. The Compliance Manager referred to the paper noting that the paper includes some indicative costs which would need to be included in the Commission budget under VMS SLA costs to cover the use of two systems for one full quarter (USD$35,000). It was noted that the Secretariat has not yet been advised of the additional costs that are likely to be charged by the airtime service providers for the direct reporting vessels, and an estimate for additional costs is also proposed. The Compliance Manager commented that some members may need assistance with using the new VMS system, so the VMS training budget was proposed to be increased by $20,000. It was noted that Commission staff would be able to conduct the testing of the system in-house WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)99  for no additional cost to the Commission. Finally the Compliance Manager noted that the Secretariat would keep Commission members updated over the next six months."
WCPFC12,754,Australia was glad to see the work going ahead and the Secretariat taking steps to maintain the service. It was noted that some time ago the Secretariat had raised the idea of having extra staff for this work.
WCPFC12,755,"The Compliance Manager confirmed there was no formal proposal to increase the number of VMS staff, but as was noted by the Executive Director earlier in the meeting the Secretariat was giving consideration to formally recruiting the IT Network Administrator position. This would allow the Commission IT Manager to focus more of his time during the first half of the year to working alongside the WCPFC VMS Manager and FFA VMS staff on implementing and testing the new VMS system and ensuring current IMS and website linkages are unaffected."
WCPFC12,756,Chinese Taipei requested the Secretariat to provide additional information including the budget implication to TCC12 and to report to members on the system once the switch is made to the new provider as an update on whether the system represents any issues for the operation of the Commission VMS. This CCM asked the Secretariat to consider placing provisions in the SLA with FFA that the service provider give prior notice next time a change of this magnitude is undertaken.
WCPFC12,757,"The Deputy Director of the FFA noted these as good suggestions. A report on how the switch went, when it happens, was considered to be a good idea. The Commission was assured that the FFA Secretariat had taken the design elements seriously, and the data rules and other elements are adequately respected. It was noted that the Secretariat was taking extra time with the system switch to be absolutely certain. In response to a question about the budget, the Deputy Director of the FFA provided an assurance that the cost savings will be very significant with the new system, USD$150,000 a year or more."
WCPFC12,758,The Chair thanked the FFA and WCPFC Secretariats for their work on changes to the Commission VMS.
WCPFC12,759,"The Commission noted WCPFC12-2015-29 on the WCPFC VMS, noting budgetary implications would be considered by FAC9. 18.2 Other matters"
WCPFC12,760,RMI noted that discussions had taken place in the margins on marine pollution from fishing vessels and encouraged all interested CCMs to continue discussing the idea and for the Secretariat to continue its work on this matter and relevant sub-committees to take up the issue further.
WCPFC12,761,"Ecuador asked for guidance on the process of applying to become a full member of the Commission, noting that this was the second year in a row that some CNMs have expressed an interest in becoming members."
WCPFC12,762,"The WCPFC Legal Advisor noted that the SWG had discussed the process. On future applications for CNM status, CNMs can indicate their interest in becoming full members by ticking a box on the application. This will provide the opportunity for TCC to consider the CNM application and make a recommendation that would then be considered by the Commission. The Legal Advisor noted that there are no formal rules on how the Commission is to consider membership of the Commission, and Article 35 of the Convention only refers to membership of the Commission being agreed to by consensus. WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)100"
WCPFC12,763,"The Pew Charitable Trusts expressed a sense of déjà vu, recalling that at the end of WCPFC12 it called on governments to get together throughout the year, to discuss and negotiate as necessary to deliver on their obligations to end overfishing and rebuild bigeye. Despite much discussion WCPFC12 delivered no additional reductions in bigeye mortality, and demonstrated no political will to do so. Despite having the strongest underlying charter of any of the tuna RFMOs, Pew stated that WCPFC has failed again failed to use the tools at its disposal to end overfishing and responsibly manage bigeye, observing that many CCMs seem to follow the approach that ‘something must be done as long as it is not me doing it.’ Emerging with no more than last year’s meeting did is an indictment on CCMs, despite the Chair’s substantial efforts to create consensus and drive discussion. Pew commented that it appears that some CCMs simply come to this meeting to prevent further management, or to look for ways to avoid it, and observed that if the Commission is to be successful, things have to change – less arguing about in-zone management and more focus on achieving high seas controls; a commitment to fully moving forward with harvest strategies, enacting regulatory measures for transshipment and stronger port-state measures, and ensuring that MCS standards are strong and comprehensive. Pew implored CCMs not to congratulate themselves because an interim reference point for skipjack was adopted, commenting that so much more is necessary and should have been achieved.  AGENDA ITEM 19 – SUMMARY REPORT OF THE WCPFC12"
WCPFC12,764,"The Secretariat advised that within seven working days of the end of the meeting a final draft of the Outcomes Document (WCPFC12-2015-30_rev1) containing the decisions taken at WCPFC12 would be available on the Commission website. It was proposed that the Commission would clear the meeting Summary Report intersessionally, as per past practice."
WCPFC12,765,There were no objections to this proposal.  AGENDA ITEM 20 – CLOSE OF MEETING
WCPFC12,766,"The Philippines expressed appreciation to the people of the Republic of Indonesia for hosting WCPFC12, their unceasing hospitality and for the meeting arrangements."
WCPFC12,767,"EU extended its thanks to the government of Indonesia and thanked the Chair for her excellent job guiding the Commission through the difficult discussions which were had this year. This CCM thanked the Executive Director and the Secretariat for their support, SPC for its guidance on scientific matters, and while the outcomes were disappointing there was a clear spirit of working together."
WCPFC12,768,"The USA thanked the government of Indonesia for the warm welcome the delegates received, the Chair and Executive Director for their leadership, the Secretariat staff and fellow Commissioners for their efforts. This CCM was leaving Bali with some frustrations, but noted its commitment to the Commission’s work intersessionally."
WCPFC12,769,"The Executive Director added the Secretariat’s gratitude to WCPFC12’s host government, for supporting the Secretariat in managing the logistics for the more than 500 delegates who attended the meeting. The Executive Director expressed appreciation to his staff for the enormous amount of work they undertook during the meeting and in the lead up to it, including preparing and coordinating the documents which facilitated the Commission’s deliberations. The Executive Director noted USA’s comments on the necessity to provide information during the intersessional period so that when delegates attend the formal meetings of the Commission they are equipped with the data and requisite knowledge needed to make meaningful decisions. The Chair’s leadership and guidance was strongly acknowledged and commended. The Executive Director noted that these were not easy issues to progress as these were WCPFC12 Summary Report (final_rev2_6 July 2016)101  international multilateral negotiations and getting agreement was always going to be difficult, especially given the multi-gear and multi-stock character of the fisheries the Commission is mandated to manage. The Executive Director noted that he had listened intently to some of the exchanges and reinforced the point that the Commission’s work should not be limited just to the annual meetings and the sub-committee meetings. The Executive Director undertook to continue reaching out to members and stakeholder in promoting and facilitating the continuation of the kind of conversations had at the Commission in less formal settings. The Executive Director wished all delegates safe travel and greetings for the festive season ahead."
WCPFC12,770,"The Chair warmly thanked the people of Bali and the government of Indonesia for hosting WCPFC12, and thanked delegates for placing their trust in her to guide their work as Chair. There were mixed outcomes this year – some good gains and also some issues that were not able to move very far. The Chair credited the delegates for their willingness to cooperate and to keep the discussions going, noting that everyone gave their best, worked hard and looked for ways to compromise. The Chair acknowledged there was a need to consider alternatives way to progress the management of stocks, which is the major issue on which the Commission has found itself unable to progress and WCPFC’s key mandate. The Chair advised the Commission that she will continue to work with the Executive Director and members to try to explore options to move these critically important issues forward and capitalise on the commitment shown throughout the week. The Chair specially thanked the Executive Director for his leadership, the Secretariat staff, not only for preparing the Chair for the meeting but for preparing all the delegates, and the rapporteur, Dr Jane Broweleit. It was acknowledged that the work behind the scenes undertaken by the Secretariat and SPC was substantial. The Chair looked forward to working with members in 2016 and seeing them in Fiji for the next annual meeting, and wished participants safe travel home."
WCPFC12,771,"The hosting country Indonesia extended its thanks to the delegates for coming to Indonesia, and wished all participants safe flights."
WCPFC12,772,The meeting closed at 7:00pm on Tuesday 8 December 2015.

WCPFC13,6,A list of all participants is attached (Attachment A). WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 4 of 3611.1 Welcome address
WCPFC13,7,"After a devotion by Reverend Kolinio Bulivakarua and a Fijian traditional ceremony of welcome, the Fijian Minister for Forests, the Hon. Osea Naiqamu, gave the opening address. Stressing the need for cooperation to meet objectives of the Convention and commitment to working together, the Minister noted that fisheries management was a vocation for many countries. The Minister noted that long term sustainability is necessary for Fiji’s people and for future generations. The Minister’s full speech is attached at Attachment B."
WCPFC13,8,"The Commission Chair, Ms Rhea Moss-Christian, made some opening remarks highlighting the importance of making progress through a step-wise, incremental approach, and the need for CCMs to avoid adopting an all-or-nothing mentality. The Chair’s full speech is attached at Attachment C."
WCPFC13,9,"In the WCPFC Executive Director’s opening remarks, Feleti Teo, OBE, noted that divergent interests within the Commission meant that negotiations were always difficult. The Executive Director stressed that the Commission’s focus should be firmly on sustainability of stocks, and those issues that were most critical, including implementing the harvest strategy approach to fisheries management, where parties agree in advance what the Commission should do when a stock reaches a certain status. The Executive Director noted the remarkable job Fiji had done to host the meeting, given the damage to Fiji from 2016’s Cyclone Winston. The Executive Director’s full speech is attached at Attachment D."
WCPFC13,10,The meeting opened at 10am on Monday 5 December 2016. 1.2 Adoption of agenda
WCPFC13,11,"In a brief discussion of the agenda (WCPFC13-2016-01_rev1), it was agreed that Korea could raise its payback plan for Pacific bluefin tuna under agenda item 9.5."
WCPFC13,12,"The agenda was adopted without amendment (Attachment E). 1.3 Meeting arrangements 1.3.1 Establishment of small working groups (CNMs, CMS, Others)"
WCPFC13,13,"The following small working groups (SWGs) were established to deal with issues in the margins of the meeting and to provide a report for consideration by plenary:  determination of interim acceptable levels of risk (led by Vice-Chair, Russell Smith)   observer safety (led by USA)  bigeye tuna rebuilding timelines (led by Australia)  finalisation of the CMR (led by TCC Chair, Alexa Cole (USA))  South Pacific albacore TRP (led by Samoa)  determination of the participatory rights for CNMs (led by Canada)  management objectives (led by Japan)"
WCPFC13,14,"In addition, drafting groups were established to progress the bridging tropical tuna measure (led by the Chair) and the bridging South Pacific albacore measure (led by New Zealand), to consult on and draft negotiating texts for WCPFC13 to discuss and the Commission to progress through 2017. It was noted that FAC would continue to meet in the margins of WCPFC13. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 5 of 3611.3.2. Election of FAC co-chair"
WCPFC13,15,The Commission appointed Magele Etuati Ropeti (Samoa) to be FAC co-chair.
WCPFC13,16,"Ropeti’s duties began immediately, to assist FAC10 to progress its work in the margins. AGENDA ITEM 2 — REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR"
WCPFC13,17,"As required by Rule 13 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission, the Executive Director presented his Annual Report for 2016 (WCPFC13-2016-05), highlighting the main work programmes and activities of the Commission and its Secretariat for 2016. The Executive Director noted that Pohnpei, FSM had hosted Pacific Islands Forum Leaders in September for their annual meeting, and the WCPFC Secretariat had hosted side meetings of leaders, and a dinner reception for Pacific leaders and representatives of development partners who are all members of the Commission. Continued outreach by the Commission Chair and Executive Director to assist in the preparation for WCPFC13 was noted. The work program was delivered on time with intended objectives and outputs accomplished. The Commission was supported by four subsidiary bodies, SC, TCC, NC and the FAC, as well as three intersessional working groups, CDS-IWG, ERandEMWG and FADMgmtOptions-IWG. The Executive Director thanked the Chairs and Co-Chairs who drove the work in these bodies. The work plans for the four subsidiary bodies to be considered by WCPFC13 formed the bulk of the 2017 Commission work program. Work would also continue on the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS) and strategic planning. The Executive Director noted a two-day workshop in 2016 had provided an opportunity for frank exchanges on key strategic objectives and priorities for the Commission; the draft Strategic Plan would be tabled during WCPFC13 for consideration and further guidance by the Commission. The Executive Director reported that the Commission’s financial affairs were in order, as tabled to FAC10. The Secretariat had added an IT officer to its staff. Contributions from USA for the special fund, Korea for tagging work, the Japan Trust Fund, and EU for supporting various scientific projects, were acknowledged, as was New Zealand’s intention to contribute to the Sustainable Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the West Pacific and East Asian Seas (WPEA-SM) project. NGO contributions were also acknowledged, including ISSF funding for an MSE workshop and NORMA’s continued funding for co-hosting Commission meetings in Pohnpei. The Executive Director recognised the work of the Commission’s Scientific Services Provider and data manager the Pacific Community – Oceanic Fisheries Programme (SPC-OFP), FFA as the Commission’s VMS provider and The International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-Like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC) as the Scientific Services Provider for NC. The Executive Director noted the continued promotion of cooperation with other organisations, which is an obligation under the Convention. The Executive Director met with the heads of IOTC, IATTC, CCSBT and ICCAT while in Rome for FAO COFI meeting this year, and participated in the Regional Fishery Body Secretariats Network. It was noted that the Commission was successfully managing two major projects – the bycatch component of the ABNJ Common Oceans project, and the WPEA."
WCPFC13,18,The Commission accepted the 2016 Annual Report of the Executive Director (WCPFC13-2016-05).
WCPFC13,19,"Fiji expressed appreciation for the Executive Director’s efforts to revive quarterly reports and did not consider major meeting outcomes were required in these reports so much as information relating to intersessional issues and events. FFA members noted the large number of Commission-hosted meetings which continued to be demanding and costly. These CCMs suggested that the Commission revert to discussing substantive business in two meeting sessions, and hoped the Corporate Plan would help streamline and focus processes and Commission work.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 6 of 361"
WCPFC13,20,"The Executive Director noted that the Secretariat follows the tasking of the Commission, the work program for which was decided by the Commission."
WCPFC13,21,Japan also noted the numerous RFMO meetings and suggested the Commission take care when considering scheduling more intersessional meetings.
WCPFC13,22,"EU noted its support for the Commission’s science and research priorities in 2017 and its financial support for a number of activities. This CCM considered research on FADs to be a top priority for the Commission. It was noted that a research plan for FADs had not yet been adopted, but the FADMgmtOptions-IWG had identified research priorities. AGENDA ITEM 3 — STATEMENTS FROM MEMBERS AND  PARTICIPATING TERRITORIES"
WCPFC13,23,"Ambassador for Pacific Economic Development, HE Shane Jones (New Zealand) noted the high priority New Zealand attaches to the management and development of the region’s fisheries, and noted the vital source of income and employment fisheries provide to the region. Effective management is critical to ensure sustainability into the future. The conservation and management measures (CMMs) adopted by the Commission go a long way towards supporting the objectives of Pacific Leaders. It was incumbent on Commission members to recognise the significance to SIDS of the region’s tuna resource, and to act accordingly and fairly. It is the role of the Commission to ensure the costs of conserving the tuna resource are fairly distributed – a key consideration as CCMs work towards new management arrangements for tropical tunas. The challenge is to see beyond individual positions to reach agreement on measures that consider the impact on all players and provide for mutually beneficial solutions. New Zealand looked forward to the progress that will be made this week by members dedicated to stronger and more effective management of this region’s valuable tuna resource."
WCPFC13,24,"The Hon. Alfred Alfred, Jr., Minister for Resources and Development (RMI) recalled that RMI led negotiations on CMM 2013-06 and CMM 2013-07, which are premised upon Article 30 of the Convention which safeguards the special requirements of SIDS. RMI continues to be concerned with proposals tabled by CCMs without direct consultations with SIDS, despite them being likely to have adverse impacts on the people and livelihoods of SIDS. At WCPFC13, RMI would highlight the importance of effectively operationalizing these two measures. RMI would also work to progress observer safety and operational data provision, to ensure that what has already been agreed is upheld and maintained with the highest standards of accountability and transparency. RMI would engage frankly and openly, taking into account the competing interests and polarizing positions that may potentially ensue over the course of the meeting."
WCPFC13,25,"The Minister for Fisheries, Semi Koroilavesau (Fiji) noted the need for engaging SIDS and avoiding disproportionate burden. Other issues important to Fiji to be discussed at WCPFC13 were mobula and manta rays bycatch reporting and control of vessels."
WCPFC13,26,"The Minister for Fisheries; Hon Mao Zeming (PNG) congratulated WCPFC for its bold and progressive management of the region’s fisheries resources, efforts that have gained recognition at the global level with the United Nations General Assembly resolution to commemorate World Tuna Day. PNG acknowledged the support of the Commission, PNA, SPC and FFA on the support provided towards achieving this. World Tuna Day puts Pacific Islands on the global stage, with the largest tuna resource in the world. Several key issues are evident in the WCPFC13 agenda, principally strengthening regional cooperation, streamlining the Commission’s focus on sustainable fisheries management and addressing the development aspirations of SIDS. A lack of prudent action on the WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 7 of 361high seas and the disproportionate burden of conservation action hinder SIDS from maximizing their full potential in fisheries. PNG called on the Commission to ensure effective and appropriate mechanisms are developed to encourage members to comply with their obligations under measures adopted by the Commission, including the effective management of the high seas. Consistent with PNG’s 2014 National Strategy for meeting the UN Sustainability Goals, PNG is embracing a systematic approach to sustainability in which the economic, socio-political and environmental systems are embedded. It is now a national priority of the PNG Government, whereby principles of responsible sustainable development mean fully gaining from PNG’s natural resources and providing equal opportunities for future generations."
WCPFC13,27,"The Hon. Puakena Boreham, Minister for Natural Resources (Tuvalu) reminded the Commission of the critical importance of its decisions to a small island nation like Tuvalu. Tuvalu is possibly the most fishery-dependent nation on earth. Tuvalu holds deep concerns that the Commission develop fishery management arrangements that are effective and equitable. Tuvalu has been rigorously implementing the 4th month FAD closure, which has greatly reduced the profitability and attractiveness of fishing in Tuvalu waters, and compromised fishery revenues. But other WCPFC coastal states have failed to impose the FAD closure in their waters, and DWFN longliners did not deliver the bigeye catch reductions they committed to. Tuvalu remains committed to the goals of the Commission, but is also determined not to carry a disproportionate share of burden."
WCPFC13,28,"Solomon Islands believes the Commission needs to take strong action on the following critical issues: the Pacific bluefin tuna fishery; a measure to give greater protection to the health and safety of our observers; progress on the development of harvest strategies for all tuna species, especially skipjack tuna and South Pacific albacore; reform of the CMS, which is currently unfair to SIDS; progress on the bridging measures for tropical tunas and South Pacific albacore. Solomon Islands noted its commitment to constructively work with all members to achieve outcomes on these and other agenda items and re-affirmed its commitment to the Commission. Solomon Islands informed the Commission that it is implementing the longline VDS in its national waters from 1 January 2017, with key e- reporting and e-monitoring components. These developments will enhance compliance monitoring and data quality for science, and improve longline fisheries management as a whole. Solomon Islands looked forward to the day when the Commission implements compatible longline measures for the high seas."
WCPFC13,29,"American Samoa noted that its economy is highly dependent on sustainable fisheries in the Convention area, and is also vulnerable to the decisions of the Commission."
WCPFC13,30,"FSM wanted to see the adoption of the draft CMM on observer safety to ensure the protection of human lives, the Commission’s eyes and ears at sea. FSM acknowledged the Chair’s efforts on the bridging tropical tuna measure and was keen to see the harvest strategies work move forward. FSM noted the discussions regarding a review of the CMS, the objectives for which must be crafted in a way that clarifies that the CMS is positive and proactive. FSM wants to preserve the recognition of the chartering scheme in all measures where appropriate, while ensuring that the arrangement does not become a means for countries to evade their capacity limits. FSM considers there to be an urgent need for the Commission to ensure the sustainability of the Special Requirements Fund (SRF). Consideration of the SIDS’ limited capacity to look after the interest of their industries should be noted. FSM noted that Pacific leaders have called for action to end IUU fishing, calling on flag states to exercise more diligent efforts in carrying out flag state responsibilities and control of nationals. Small countries in the Pacific own the vast majority of the resources that come from the ocean in the Convention area and have much at stake as it is their most important natural resource. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 8 of 361"
WCPFC13,31,"The Philippines noted its commitment to ensuring the long-term sustainability of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks in the Commission area, consistent with its rights and obligations under UNCLOS, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and the WCPF Convention. Nationally, the Philippines’ Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act 10654 or the Act to Deter, Eliminate, and Prevent Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing became effective on October 2015. Philippines noted it was a developing state, facing many challenges. The Philippines’ compliance with measures is a work in progress but with an enhanced policy framework in place, Philippines is confident it will overcome the initial transition period with the support of the Commission and cooperation with other CCMs. The Philippines expressed appreciation for the Commission’s continued support through capacity building activities, progressively improving Philippines’s compliance, as reflected in the CMR process each year. The Philippines was pleased to inform the Commission that it will host the next Commission meeting, WCPFC14, in 2017. AGENDA ITEM 4 — MEMBERSHIP AND OTHER APPLICATIONS 4.1 Status of the Convention"
WCPFC13,32,"No new information had been provided from the depositary of the WCPFC Convention, New Zealand. The status of the Convention is outlined in WCPFC13-2016-06."
WCPFC13,33,The Commission noted the report on Status of Convention (WCPFC13-2016-06). 4.2 Update on Observer status
WCPFC13,34,"There was no discussion under this agenda item, however a lengthy exchange on observer participation took place under agenda item 15.2."
WCPFC13,35,The Commission noted the updated list of observers to the Commission (WCPFC13-2016-07). 4.3 Applications for Cooperating Non-Member status
WCPFC13,36,"The Commission considered applications for Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) status for 2017 in accordance with CMM 2009-11 (WCPFC13-2016-08). There were seven applications for CNM status. The Chair noted that one application had been provided with all requisite information (El Salvador), with others requiring further information: for Ecuador, the application was complete after TCC12 so no further information was requested; Liberia had provided the information requested by TCC12; and Vietnam had provided the required information. TCC12 had requested further information from Thailand on its historical fishing activities. Thailand had since confirmed it had no historical fishing activity to report. Panama’s Annual Report Part 1 was outstanding. Panama confirmed during discussions under this agenda item that an email from the Panamanian government had been sent on 2 December containing the required information, including the Annual Report Part 1. This was subsequently verified by the Secretariat during discussions. Mexico’s contribution was outstanding. While Mexico was not present at the commencement of WCPFC13, this matter was taken up by the Commission."
WCPFC13,37,"FFA members expressed that they continued to support a WCPFC decision that CNMs are to provide a contribution to the Commission; and participants need to share the costs of conservation and management of the fish stocks under the Commission’s purview. CNMs pay only 50% of the amount it would if it were a member. Mexico’s contribution was again outstanding, a matter which had been the subject of extensive discussion at the last two Commission meetings. FFA members stated they WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 9 of 361would not agree to CNM status for any applicant with an outstanding financial contribution or who is unable to commit to making the contribution for the next year."
WCPFC13,38,"The Chair noted that after a similar situation last year, Mexico was able to make a payment during the meeting. It was agreed that the informal small working group would consider the applications for CNM status that had been approved (Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Panama, Thailand, and Vietnam), but not Mexico’s, as it was not present."
WCPFC13,39,USA took the view that contributions are voluntary and that CNM status should not turn on the matter of the payment or non-payment of the contribution.
WCPFC13,40,The Executive Director noted that no delegates from Mexico were yet registered for WCPFC13. Some CCMs suggested that the agenda stay open to wait for a possible Mexico delegation.
WCPFC13,41,"The Commission turned its attention to requests for full membership received from Ecuador and El Salvador. Ecuador noted that it had sent a letter on 16 November 2016, subsequently circulated by Secretariat, outlining its application for full membership. Ecuador explained that it was fully committed to tuna stock conversation and has been a CNM for eight years. It had requested an invitation to become a full member for the last four years. Ecuador has been a member of IATTC for more than 50 years, is a member of SPRMO and party to UNCLOS and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement."
WCPFC13,42,El Salvador noted that it has been a CNM since 2008 and has provided voluntary contributions to the Commission on time annually. El Salvador noted it is an IATTC member and is committed to not increasing fishing capacity in the Western and Central Pacific; its vessel numbers would remain unchanged. El Salvador commented that none of its vessels had been involved in IUU activities and it requires 100% observer coverage on its flagged vessels.
WCPFC13,43,"FFA members considered that the matter needed careful consideration, citing the uniqueness of the Commission. Unlike other RFMOs, the majority of WCPFC members are SIDS who are overwhelmingly dependent on fisheries resources. In addition, the majority of fishing takes place within SIDS’ waters. These CCMs considered that when more of a level playing field for SIDS exists in the Commission, FFA members will be in a position to develop a process for considering inviting new members to join."
WCPFC13,44,"USA welcomed El Salvador’s request, and explained that an obligation is created when an RFMO is established. The Commission had a responsibility to consider the international legal context within which an RFMO is granted rights to manage fish stocks – these include UNCLOS, UNFSA and other international law which provides these institutions authority. There was a responsibility to consider in a meaningful way the interest of other nations to become members. For USA, even the special nature of WCPFC did not obviate the need for the Commission to consider requests fairly. The Convention provides that new members can be admitted through an invitation arrived at through consensus. USA stated that there should be criteria for considering those applications, and it should be a fair, transparent and objective process. Criteria could include whether the prospective member state has the ability to manage its fleets and is willing to exercise that ability. USA considered that an invitation would not come with an automatic right to allocation, and an informal small working group could develop the criteria."
WCPFC13,45,"Other states supported this view, with EU considering that the inclusion of countries participating in IATTC into WCPFC would be beneficial to the organisation. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 10 of 361"
WCPFC13,46,"While WCPFC13 did not reach consensus on accepting the Ecuador and El Salvador applications for full membership of WCPFC, the Chair noted that this did not preclude a CCM starting a process to develop a draft set of criteria for considering requests for membership in 2017."
WCPFC13,47,On 8 December the Commission was informed that a delegate from Mexico had arrived at WCPFC13.
WCPFC13,48,"Mexico made a lengthy statement relating to its CNM status, stating its case for CNM status and noting its commitment to collaborating in the implementation of Commission measures (WCPFC13-2016-08_Att 5 MX)."
WCPFC13,49,"USA thanked Mexico for its comprehensive explanation of both its application and the historical context. USA considered the continued participation of Mexico as a CNM to be important, especially in the context of the NC’s work, and encouraged the Commission to accept Mexico as a CNM in 2017."
WCPFC13,50,"Japan also supported the application, noting that Mexico does not fish in the Convention area but contributes to the Commission as a member of IATTC on the management of Pacific bluefin tuna. Mexico had not made a voluntary contribution but was committed to making a financial contribution. Canada, China, Indonesia, Korea and Chinese Taipei also supported Mexico’s application. It was noted that Mexico was a key member of IATTC."
WCPFC13,51,"Regarding the issue of whether contributions were voluntary or not, EU did not consider it was a condition according to the Convention. This CCM asked that the Commission provide legal certainty."
WCPFC13,52,Canada considered that Mexico’s payment schedule should meet the Commission’s expectations regarding financial contributions.
WCPFC13,53,Nauru noted that the Commission debates the issue each year. All participants contribute to the Commission through their participation and financial contributions. CNMs have a 50% discount on member contributions. This CCM noted that Mexico’s explanation about its non-payment was new and some time was needed to consider it.
WCPFC13,54,"After discussions in an informal small working group, on 9 December, FFA members advised that they accepted Mexico’s offer, conditional on the payment schedule it had offered. Mexico thanked the Commission for considering its application and reiterated it would stand by the offer made."
WCPFC13,55,New Zealand suggested a specific date that the payment would be provided to the Secretariat would be useful.
WCPFC13,56,"The report of the informal small working group, which met three times during WCPFC13, was accepted by WCPFC13:"
WCPFC13,57,"For 2017, seven CNM requests were submitted to the Secretariat using the agreed electronic format within the required timeframe. Those requests were from: Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand, and Vietnam."
WCPFC13,58,"WCPFC13 approved CNM status to Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Panama, Thailand, and Vietnam for 2017."
WCPFC13,59,"WCPFC13 also approved CNM status to Mexico for 2017, subject to the payment of Mexico’s 2016 assessed financial contribution by June 30 2017 (payment in the first semester) and its 2017 assessed contribution by December 31 2017 (payment in the second semester).   WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 11 of 361"
WCPFC13,60,"At the Chair’s direction, a small working group (SWG) was established to assess associated participatory rights of each CNM applicant whose CNM status was approved at the plenary. Framework documents for the working group were CMM 2009-11 and Secretariat paper WCPFC13-2016-08. The group also referred to TCC12’s recommendations in the CNM section of the TCC12 Summary Report."
WCPFC13,61,"The SWG noted with appreciation the attendance and participation of Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand, and Vietnam in the Group’s discussions."
WCPFC13,62,"In addition to the discussions regarding participatory rights, some of the attending CNMs also raised the question as to how the Commission invites a non-member to become a full member, noting that Ecuador, El Salvador, and Vietnam had expressed their interest in becoming a full member of the Commission in their CNM applications."
WCPFC13,63,Participants supported the recommendation of TCC12 to include a column in the template where CNM applicants could indicate their interest in becoming a member of the commission but felt that further discussion was not warranted on the membership process as the issue was outside the mandate of the SWG.
WCPFC13,64,It was confirmed that applications were complete and outstanding data addressed for the seven applicants. 4.3.1 Participatory rights of CNMs
WCPFC13,65,"The SWG agreed to recommend that the CNMs accepted by the WCPFC plenary (i.e. Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam) have the same participatory rights in 2017 as they had in 2016."
WCPFC13,66,"WCPFC13 agreed to the following limits to be applied to the participatory rights of CNMs (Convention / CMM 2009-11):  a. In accordance with the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following participatory rights apply to Cooperating Non- Members (CNMs) for fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area.  b. In addition, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under their national jurisdiction or other CCMs’ national jurisdiction, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements.  c. CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPFC Convention and the WCPFC conservation and management measures. In addition, CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV).  d. CCMs shall ensure that CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention.  e. Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will take into account compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, and all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPFC Convention. CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the Secretariat for attention by TCC. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 12 of 361 Participatory rights of each CNM in 2017 Ecuador"
WCPFC13,67,"The participatory rights for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2015-01 or its replacement measure. El Salvador"
WCPFC13,68,The participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. The total level of effort by purse seine vessels of El Salvador on the high seas shall not exceed 29 days in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2015-01 or its replacement measure. Liberia
WCPFC13,69,"The participatory rights of Liberia are limited to reefer vessels to engage in transhipment activities, and bunker and supply vessels to support fishing vessels in the Convention area. Mexico"
WCPFC13,70,"It was noted that Mexico had participated in the work of the Northern Committee (NC) at NC 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 and, noting the need for cooperation with the work of the NC particularly in regard to Pacific bluefin tuna, encouraged Mexico to continue to participate in the NC. Mexico does not intend to have a vessel presence in 2017. Any future introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2015-01 or its replacement measure. Panama"
WCPFC13,71,"The participatory rights of Panama in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels. Panama’s participatory rights also apply to vessels that supply food, water and spare parts to carrier vessels that engage in transhipment activities, provided that these vessels do not engage in activities supporting fishing vessels, including providing and/or servicing FADs. The SWG also noted that this does not result in any additional participatory rights in 2017 to the participatory rights granted to Panama in 2016. Thailand"
WCPFC13,72,The participatory rights of Thailand in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only. Vietnam
WCPFC13,73,The participatory rights of Vietnam in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 13 of 361WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area
WCPFC13,74,"In accordance with the decision of WCPFC9 regarding the management of the overlap area of 4˚S and between 130˚W and 150˚W, vessels flagged to Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico will be governed by the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area."
WCPFC13,75,"In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area."
WCPFC13,76,"For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with international and domestic laws, vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area. Amendment to be made to the CNM request template"
WCPFC13,77,"WCPFC13 agreed, as originally recommended by TCC12, to include a column in the CNM application template where CNM applicants could indicate their interest in becoming a member of the Commission. The Secretariat was tasked with making the necessary amendment to the CNM request template.  AGENDA ITEM 5 — NEW PROPOSALS"
WCPFC13,78,"CCMs were asked to present their proposals to WCPFC13, noting that proposals addressing matters best covered under other agenda items would be presented there. Proposals requiring additional work before their adoption were given the benefit of informal discussion time throughout the meeting in small groups. Observer safety"
WCPFC13,79,"The USA proposal relating to observer safety (WCPFC13-2016-DP21) was worked on by a large number of CCMs and observers – over 100 – in an informal small working group which met four times in the margins of the meeting, including one session which went late into the night. On 8 December USA reported that the primary remaining sticking point was the legally binding nature of the agreement, and noted that Japan had received legal advice and provided input into the document."
WCPFC13,80,"China noted that observer safety was paramount, and recalled the clear decision made last year that the Commission would put time into crafting an agreement. China recognised the sticking points around the legal mechanism to be used for the agreement and asked the Commission to think laterally about the issue. While it was not ideal to have something that is not binding, China commented that there may be other ways to meet the paramount objective of ensuring the safety of observers."
WCPFC13,81,"USA brought the draft measure to plenary for adoption on 9 December for the Commission’s consideration, noting that through much effort in the working group discussions the text no longer had any square brackets. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 14 of 361"
WCPFC13,82,"Japan thanked the informal small working group chair, Alexa Cole (USA) for her hard work but noted legal difficulties it had in implementing the provisions in the measure. This CCM expressed sincere thanks for the special consideration for Japan through the footnotes in the measure, giving it some exemptions from the obligation to implement the provisions. Japan noted the efforts it had made to obtain final approval from Tokyo on the language which had been formulated by the Japanese delegates at WCPFC13 but considered it highly unlikely that they would receive clear instructions before WCPFC13 closed. Japan apologised if this would undermine the Commission’s efforts but there was no option but for Japan to oppose the adoption of the measure as they did not have instructions to support it."
WCPFC13,83,"Chinese Taipei recognised the importance of observers and supported the adoption of the measure, though noting that during discussions in the informal small working group it had expressed deep concern about definition of “harassment” and “harass”. As it was agreed by the informal small working group that each CCM has the right to interpret the definition of the discussed words with applicable domestic laws, this CCM agreed to adopt this measure."
WCPFC13,84,"WWF decried the inability of the Commission to adopt the measure. Noting that this observer had hoped to be able to express admiration for the work of all involvement in getting it adopted, WWF regretted that it could not now do that. WWF stated that the Commission had abdicated its duty to the people that serve in its fisheries, gathering the critical data it uses to manage stocks. The Commission was responsible for these observers and if the Commission was really treating them as of paramount importance it should approve this measure. In six years, five observers had died doing their work. WWF had heard a lot during the informal small working group sessions about domestic legal constraints making a CCM unable to implement the measure. WWF stated that that there should be a burden of proof for this; information should be provided to the Commission as evidence of this constraint. In addition, the burden should be on CCMs to prove an observer complaint was untrue. WWF felt strongly that these issues were not esoteric; observers are human beings and the Commission owed them its protection."
WCPFC13,85,"PNG commented that it had the biggest observer programme in the region and it hurt when observers disappear. PNG sacrifices budget to ensure the families of those who have gone missing are taken care of. PNG expressed its gratitude to participants of the informal small working group but noted its disappointment that the measure did not have consensus as observers were human beings, not objects."
WCPFC13,86,"RMI supported the comments by PNG and WWF and noted that despite the push on this issue it had missed what it had hoped to achieve on observer safety. Legal constraints aside, this CCM noted that as an observer provider RMI will go out of its way to ensure observer safety."
WCPFC13,87,"Australia acknowledged the foregoing comments and the USA for the extraordinary effort it had put into crafting the measure. An observer safety measure would form part of the rights and responsibilities of vessel operators and captains outlined in CMM 2007-01, which already requires that ROP observers not be assaulted, obstructed, resisted, delayed, intimidated, interfered with, influenced bribed, or attempted to be bribed in the performance of their duties. The duty to render assistance and protect human life is required by UNCLOS. The International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue outlines responsibilities of governments related to search and rescue. Australia noted that experience has shown that these are not enough, with five deaths in six years. Observers play a critical role in meeting the Commission’s responsibilities for fisheries management and are essential to ensuring the integrity of management measures. Australia considered them to be like diplomats: they must be able to conduct their jobs unimpeded and in a safe environment, free of threats and intimidation. Their personal safety is paramount. In addition, this is about human life and safety; the seas are a dangerous place. People doing work on the Commission’s behalf should be able to go to their jobs and come WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 15 of 361home to their families at the end of a trip knowing that everything that can reasonably be done is being done to keep them safe. Preventative actions and education are important to ensuring observers remain safe –including providing observers with the right to refuse to board without recrimination or loss of pay if the vessel does not meet standard safety requirements; protecting them from intimidation, threats and assaults; entitling them to respect; providing access to medical care if sick or injured; immediate action and cooperation on search and rescue if an observer goes missing; prompt arrangements for the return of the body to the observer’s family in the unfortunate event an observer dies. Australia considered that flag states have a responsibility to ensure regular industry education on the importance of accurate data and providing a safe environment for observers under national laws. Observer training and adequate observer insurance are also important issues, but should not stop the Commission taking action on observer safety."
WCPFC13,88,"FSM noted that many observers from its own observer program are placed on WCPFC vessels. This CCM was not sure how it was going to be able to place its observers on vessels without this measure, commenting that FSM needs to make sure they come back to their families."
WCPFC13,89,Vanuatu voiced its concern and requested observer providers to advise what the implications were if the Commission could not get the measure through. It asked if there would be penalties for not putting observers on vessels.
WCPFC13,90,"Nauru, one of the smallest observer providers, expressed disappointment. This CCM noted the long discussions in the informal small working group, including comments from some participants that observers were just like crew. However, Nauru stated that observers are not crew, and are not covered by the ILO Convention which is why CCMs fight for them within the Commission. This CCM also noted the insurance issue other CCMs had mentioned. If Nauru did not put observers on CCMs’ boats, there was an outstanding question of whether those boats could fish. From 1 January 2017, Nauru would be implementing this in its EEZ. This CCM questioned why Japan needed to talk with capital about the language in the measure, noting that all CCMs come to WCPFC with a mandate and brought credentials to this effect. Nauru suggested taking the matter of adopting the measure to a vote."
WCPFC13,91,"Kiribati noted that if safety of observers was not guaranteed, it could not put them on boats. This CCM supported the recommendation to put the matter to a vote."
WCPFC13,92,"EU noted its support for the measure and expressed disappointed that consensus could not be reached. While EU did not think there should be exemptions, it considered that the text had taken Japan’s concerns into account. This CCM preferred consensus, not a vote, and invited Japan to reconsider its position."
WCPFC13,93,"PNG noted WWF’s impassioned statement at WCPFC12 and how hard the Commission had worked to get the measure across the line at WCPFC13. This CCM noted that observers in the Pacific are a close knit group of people and, as an observer provider, PNG deals with them daily. PNG came to WCPFC13 with a mandate to agree this measure and asked how the Commission could value the lives of fish and not uphold the sanctity of human life."
WCPFC13,94,Samoa expressed it disappointment in the delaying tactics it had observed. This CCM wished participants had seen how observers are sometimes treated on boats. These observers are from small island nations and go full-hearted to their work. Samoa noted there were other international obligations that need to be met by CCMs on observer safety.
WCPFC13,95,"Tuvalu expressed disappointment that one CCM was blocking the measure after receiving exemptions. This CCM stated that all reasonable attempts to reach consensus had been exhausted and it would not WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 16 of 361accept deferral for another year. Supporting the proposal to put the matter to a vote, Tuvalu noted it had 80 observers in its program and considered the matter one of human life and death."
WCPFC13,96,"Also supporting the proposal to put the matter to a vote, New Zealand noted the many participants who worked every available hour on this measure and made passionate and emotional statements supporting the need to take action."
WCPFC13,97,Fiji noted that it had come to WCPFC13 to adopt this issue. It saw no option but to support the suggestion to put it to a vote.
WCPFC13,98,"USA thanked the informal small working group chair, for her efforts in leading the informal small working group and to WWF for reminding participants of their humanity. This CCM recognised that until the Commission acted, they are just words."
WCPFC13,99,The Cook Islands respected and recognised the views put forward. Its preference was for consensus but would support a vote if that was the path taken.
WCPFC13,100,"Korea recognised the importance of the safety of observers at sea, which no CCM questioned, including fishing nations. Korea had focused mainly on the drafting and noted that no elements of the original draft had been taken out through negotiations. Korea recognised the frustration but was uncomfortable putting the matter to a vote rather than adopting by consensus."
WCPFC13,101,"China thanked the informal small working group chair, for her efforts and noted the importance of the issue. China had no difficulties with the provisions of the draft measure and could implement it. China noted that search and rescue continuing for 72 hours was a common practice in its national jurisdiction. It also noted that when China’s fishers went missing in Japanese waters, Japan does it too. China was uncomfortable going to a vote and hoped the measure could be adopted by consensus."
WCPFC13,102,"Tokelau considered all avenues to address this at TCC12, intersessionally, and at WCPFC13 were exhausted. FFA Ministers had stressed the importance of the work of observers in collecting data for compliance purposes. Tokelau noted that the Convention allows for a time for a vote to be fixed if it appeared “that all efforts to reach a decision by consensus have been exhausted”."
WCPFC13,103,RMI supported EU’s request to hear from Japan before considering the options exhausted.
WCPFC13,104,"Japan explained that it had received the proposal intersessionally from USA and after analysing it in detail concluded that not all of the provisions could be implemented within Japan’s current legal framework. Upon arriving in Fiji, the Japanese delegation started discussing these issues with other delegations and realized that these issues were much more serious than Japan had initially thought.  Consequently, Japan began the process of consulting with Tokyo for further instructions. Japan noted having limited flexibility and unless a clear instruction was received from Tokyo, Japan could not support the document. Japan recognised the situation was far from satisfactory and offered a number of commitments in a personal capacity. First, Japan could support if the document becomes a non-binding resolution. Second, Japan suggested that footnote one be amended to oblige Members to explain to TCC and WCPFC the reason for any non-implementation of provisions even though it is non-binding. Third, Japan would submit a detailed legal analysis to TCC13 on why it could not implement the provisions. This CCM also noted that Japan would come to WCPFC14 with a better position. Japan did not want the matter to go to a vote and noted that if that course was taken Japan would have to oppose. Japan’s head of delegation apologised to observers who have suffered and may suffer from the lack of a measure but stressed that this was the most he could offer.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 17 of 361"
WCPFC13,105,"The FFA Secretariat noted that as an observer provider, they knew they put individuals at risk each time they sent observers out to sea. If adopted, there would be an immediate improvement in observers’ conditions. The FFA Secretariat noted the amount of time and effort that had been devoted to the draft measure both within and outside the WCPFC processes. A meeting of coordinators had taken place. The FFA Fisheries Ministers had discussed the matter. TCC had discussed the draft. The USA had put in vast intersessional work. This work had been put in because of the preference for consensus. The FFA Secretariat took the view that there was no other way forward – the discussions had taken place and the drafting had been done. The Commission was urged to pick up the suggestion to take the matter to a vote."
WCPFC13,106,"The Chair enquired whether the alternative offered by Japan would offer CCMs any comfort. While China noted that it could go along with Japan’s suggestion, Tonga asked that a time be fixed for a vote. With the lack of possibility of reaching consensus on the draft measure for observer safety and the calls for a vote, the Chair fixed time for the vote to take place one hour later. However, just prior to the vote taking place, Japan advised that it had just received an instruction from Tokyo and could join the consensus to adopt the measure."
WCPFC13,107,The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2016-03 Conservation and Management Measure for the Protection of WCPFC Regional Observer Programme Observers (Attachment F). Amending Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission
WCPFC13,108,"EU’s proposal to amend Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission was considered by SC12 and TCC12. EU explained that the intention of the amendment (WCPFC13-2016-DP04) was to facilitate the work of TCC – several data provision paragraphs were unclear and had required lengthy discussions in TCC. In the end these were inconclusive and certain obligations were not able to be assessed. EU noted that significant progress had been made in agreeing several of the proposed amendments through the sub-committees. Two issues remained outstanding for further discussion by the Commission – the obligation to provide operational data and addressing situations where CCMs are assessed as non-compliant because information from observer providers has not been provided to SPC in a timely manner. Regarding the first issue, EU stated an intention to capture the obligation to provide data to the Commission rather than through bilateral agreements with SPC. EU noted there was no consensus on this point, or the second point."
WCPFC13,109,China highlighted a difficulty it had with a proposed change from “should” to “shall” which changed the legal status of the document.
WCPFC13,110,Japan noted that it had signed an MOU with SPC to provide operational data while complying with a domestic requirement for confidentiality. Japan stated that this was the only way it could currently provide operational data and thus did not support the proposed amendment to rules for operational data submission.
WCPFC13,111,"Indonesia understood the importance of the Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission, noting that Indonesia was developing a harvest strategy in its archipelagic waters which will rely on good data. Indonesia’s fisheries are complex, multi-species, multi-gear and small scale fisheries. The Indonesian fleet did not currently operate in the high seas and Indonesia was fully committed to providing the data but still faced difficulties complying with the CMM. Its intention was to try and comply. It was also noted that the proposed change from “should” to “shall” would impact Indonesia.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 18 of 361"
WCPFC13,112,"RMI made a general comment about proposals needing to engage with CMM 2013-06, which the EU proposal had done. RMI fully supported the intent of EU’s proposal and looked forward to its agreement, noting data provision was an ongoing issue for the Commission."
WCPFC13,113,USA looked forward to the proposal’s adoption and had provided comments it hoped would be taken into account.
WCPFC13,114,"On the basis of comments received from FFA and consultations with those CCMs with concerns, EU submitted a revised version of the proposal on 9 December (WCPFC13-2016-DP04_rev1)."
WCPFC13,115,USA and China noted that their comments had been taken on board and they could support the proposal.
WCPFC13,116,CNMI sought to clarify the scientific name of striped marlin on page one of Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission (Kajikia audax) and queried the correct scientific name for Pacific Bluefin tuna.
WCPFC13,117,"EU clarified that broader text would not be amended by the EU proposal, which was only concerned with the obligation to provide data. EU suggested that SC could be asked to look at an update to the nomenclature if necessary."
WCPFC13,118,"Indonesia commented that it would try its best to satisfy all the requirements to provide data but needed to strengthen its observer programs, starting next year. Indonesia was sure it would not be able to fulfil these obligations in 2017 and requested time to be able to do so. But it did not object to adoption of the proposal as it understood the role good data played in supporting the stock assessments."
WCPFC13,119,EU clarified that it was not intending to create new obligations with the proposed amendments.
WCPFC13,120,Japan noted that once the amendments were adopted they were mandatory and suggested Indonesia needed some arrangements so that this CCM will not be assessed as non-compliant on the new requirement until the capacity building program is completed.
WCPFC13,121,The Chair noted that Indonesia may not be ready to meet the obligations until later in 2017 and adoption with a footnote providing additional time for Indonesia could be considered. The length of time would need to be discussed.
WCPFC13,122,"In response to Japan’s request, the WCPFC Compliance Manager, Dr Lara Manarangi-Trott, clarified that decisions of the Commission become binding 60 days after end of commission meeting, unless there is a time delay built into a CMM or decision. When the obligations would be assessed for compliance purposes was a different matter."
WCPFC13,123,"With Japan and China offering helpful clarifying comments, the Chair confirmed that compliance against the revised measure would be assessed from 2018, not 2017 and asked if this could satisfy Indonesia on data collection."
WCPFC13,124,"Indonesia noted that its operational data will be available to the Commission from 2025 and EEZ data is gathered from its observer program. Based on its experience with port sampling data, Indonesia considered it could probably provide the data from those programs for 2018 but maybe not all required data, for example discard data and size data. Indonesia would train observers to do it correctly. It would not be easy for Indonesia to fulfil its obligations. Indonesia would try its best to submit the data in 2018 but could not guarantee it would meet the standard for SPC or the Commission. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 19 of 361"
WCPFC13,125,"The Chair suggested that the Commission could adopt the proposal, noting Indonesia’s difficulties, or adopt the measure with a caveat outlining Indonesia’s implementation schedule."
WCPFC13,126,Japan proposed that the Commission adopt the proposal and offered to assist Indonesia draft some language to put to the Commission reflecting Indonesia’s concerns on the submission of data.
WCPFC13,127,The Commission agreed to adopt the revised “Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission” decision (Attachment G).
WCPFC13,128,The Commission agreed that the following text from Indonesia could be recorded as report language in relation to decision on WCPFC13-2016-DP04_rev1 on Scientific Data to be provided amendment: “WCPFC13 agreed that there is a technical difficulty for Indonesia to fulfil new request such as provision of discard data until the capacity building program including the data collection system is completed.” Proposed Terms for a review of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme
WCPFC13,129,"Introducing WCPFC13-2016-24, the WCPFC Compliance Manager noted that TCC had tasked the Secretariat with preparing a revised TOR for the review of the CMS for the Commission’s consideration (paragraph 139, TCC12 Summary Report). A number of comments had been received from CCMs, including WCPFC13-2016-DP12 which had been considered in the development of WCPFC13-2016-24 and more recently WCPFC13-2016-DP29 from FFA members. There were outstanding questions for the Commission about whether the review should take place in 2017 or 2018, and budgetary implications of the review which the FAC was awaiting guidance on. Regardless of whether the Commission decides the review should be undertaken in 2017 or 2018, a review panel will need to be appointed and a timeline drawn up. The input of members would be sought, a selection process outlined, and the Executive Director would appoint a panel. The WCPFC Compliance Manager noted this would ideally happen in April or May – it was proposed that the reviewers would travel to Pohnpei to meet with the Secretariat and FSM, as a representative of CCMs, for discussions to guide their work. The panel would attend TCC in September to observe the process. In December, the Chair of the review panel would attend the annual Commission meeting and provide a progress report which would be due in March the following year. This report would be sent to members for consideration through that next year. Depending on the outcome of the observer participation discussions, confidentiality arrangements for the review panel may need to be further considered, although it was noted that consultants are subject to contracts including confidentiality clauses which have been sufficient in the past. The WCPFC Compliance Manager noted that the Commission would need to consider an interim arrangement following the end of the current CMS measure, to cover the review period. Options in the terms of reference reflect that need. The working paper also contained an indicative budget."
WCPFC13,130,"Japan supported the basic concept of a review but noted its USD $124,000 indicative budget. This CCM commented that several other proposals on the agenda had budgetary implications and something might have to be dropped. Japan reserved the right to come back to this. Japan also asked about the relationship between WCPFC13-2016-DP29 and WCPFC13-2016-DP12."
WCPFC13,131,"FFA members thanked the Secretariat for incorporating most of its suggestions in WCPFC13-2016-DP12 but one specific comment was not included, relating to whether the CMS process is procedurally fair, and produces fair and reasonable outcomes. For these CCMs, this was a critical part of this review and must be reflected into the terms of reference. The review should include all three principles outlined in WCPFC13-2016-DP12 – effectiveness, efficiency and fairness. FFA members did not support pushing the review out another year and supported the proposed schedule and adoption of a WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 20 of 361clear process at WCPFC13. These CCMs supported a review panel with at least three consultants. It was noted that the terms of reference included consideration of mechanisms to respond to non-compliance. These CCMs were interested in experiences and practices elsewhere that would inform the future work of the Commission and reiterated their longstanding position that the CMS should provide the right balance between supporting CCMs, particularly in respect of developing States, and punitive or other remedial actions in response to specific forms of non-compliance."
WCPFC13,132,"China’s concern centred on what constituted “independent”, hoping that “Commission” expert could be used instead in the terms of reference. China commented that panel members should come from its part of the region, and noted this could make it more difficult to select people. China asked for confirmation whether or not the Commission made a decision to establish the panel, noting Japan’s suggestion to hold the issue open."
WCPFC13,133,"In response to a query about the methodology around selection of the experts, the WCPFC Compliance Manager suggested that a WCPFC Circular would be prepared requesting nominations. Once a list of nominations was compiled, Commission members would assist the Secretariat to priority-rank them."
WCPFC13,134,"EU noted that FFA members’ comments went well beyond what was agreed and what an independent panel reviewing a CMS should be tasked with. EU considered the review should focus on the efficiency of the process and whether adequate resources were allocated, whereas FFA’s comments were more in line with a performance review, which would look at all aspects of the organisation."
WCPFC13,135,"USA agreed with FFA members that the review should encompass the whole CMS over the last 6 years, although USA wanted more time to consider other aspects of the FFA proposal. Regarding the timing of the review, revisions in the new measure were intended to directly address procedural and fairness issues; therefore, there would be benefit to allowing the current measure to run another year and in the review taking place in 2018 rather than 2017. The TCC Chair noted that TCC had experienced growing pains this year in working with the new measure, but expected improvement next year."
WCPFC13,136,"The Chair noted there were still drafting and conceptual issues to address. An informal small working group was formed to undertake further discussions, led by New Zealand. On 9 December, New Zealand advised that the informal small working group was close to resolution on the terms but needed more time for discussions."
WCPFC13,137,"EU did not object to looking at the CMS in detail, but preferred it be part of a wider exercise reviewing not just compliance but the whole functioning of WCPFC, including the challenges of resourcing the Commission faces. It considered that this was an appropriate time to have a performance review and the analysis of the CMS should be part of this. However, despite its hesitations, the EU did not oppose consensus."
WCPFC13,138,"Considering this a lower priority than other matters, Japan recalled earlier discussions about looking at the proposed audit as part of the whole budget. Japan was not willing to support the project at this point, and would raise its concerns in FAC."
WCPFC13,139,"New Zealand noted the good, constructive discussions in the working group and advised that the findings of the CMS audit will be considered in the next Commission performance review, indeed would assist to streamline it. New Zealand noted that the audit was a priority for SIDS. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 21 of 361"
WCPFC13,140,"Later on 9 December, the Chair noted that FAC was waiting for a decision on the review before it could finalising the allocation of funds for 2017 and clarified that funds were available for the audit."
WCPFC13,141,"With Japan commenting that it was still not convinced of the need to spend USD $124,000 on the project, New Zealand and Japan worked together in the margins to come up with a final text. New Zealand advised that a number of compromises had been made in the margins relating to the timing of the review and the composition of the panel and the terms of reference could now be agreed. Japan was then able to join the consensus on the review. (WCPFC13-2016-24_rev1)"
WCPFC13,142,The Commission approved the Terms for the Independent Review of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme which is to occur in 2017 (Attachment H). List of obligations to be assessed by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme
WCPFC13,143,"USA introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP20, a list of obligations to be assessed by the CMS, noting an FFA suggestion had been the inclusion of an assessment against the provisions of paragraph 3 of CMM 2013-06, the CMM on criteria for the consideration of conservation and management proposals. USA noted that the Commission would need to give the Secretariat clear guidance about how to make such an assessment, since it is an obligation for the Commission as a whole, not for individual CCMs. USA noted that New Zealand recommended that all CMMs that are amended be automatically scheduled for review during the first TCC session that occurs after the amendment.  The only such amended CMM relevant for review in 2016-2018 (i.e. those scheduled to be reviewed less often than every year) is the seabird measure, and USA shifted its review schedule in this proposal accordingly.  USA highlighted New Zealand’s broader proposal for the Commission to consider when it updates the assessment schedule for future years.  USA also reported some discussions about overlap area notifications. USA advised that work was continuing in the margins and CCMs were still commenting on the list; a new version would be prepared."
WCPFC13,144,"On 9 December, USA referred the meeting to WCPFC13-2016-DP20_rev1, noting that there were some outstanding comments to be discussed in plenary, including the suggestion from FFA members that paragraph 3 of CMM 2013-06, relating to evaluating the impact of proposals on SIDS and territories, should be included in the list. USA took the view that it was an obligation on the Commission as a whole, not individual CCMs. A second issue was a suggestion from Japan that the full utilisation of sharks (paragraph 6 of CMM 2010-07) be assessed every year rather than every second year. Thirdly, PNA suggested changes in assessing paragraph 20 of the tropical tuna measure relating to limits in-zone and paragraph 24 not being assessed in 2017. USA advised that it had not revised the measure to accommodate those suggestions."
WCPFC13,145,"Japan stated that the review of paragraph 6 of CMM 2010-07 should be conducted every year. Regarding CMM 2013-06, Japan considered that this should be reviewed when a CCM puts a proposal forward, rather than assessed at TCC and had difficulty accepting the inclusion of CMM 2013-06."
WCPFC13,146,EU raised concerns about the deletion from the list of paragraph 6 of CMM 2010-07 being assessed annually. EU noted there even if there was an issue with provision of information it was nevertheless important to continue assessing this measure annually.
WCPFC13,147,New Zealand made a general recommendation that any measures that are amended by the Commission should be assessed at the next TCC.
WCPFC13,148,USA noted this would need to be the subsequent TCC so any amendment had a full year of being in effect before being assessed. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 22 of 361
WCPFC13,149,"From RMI’s point of view, CMM 2013-06 was a Commission measure that should be strictly adhered to. It includes a checklist which calls for a consultative process about needs and capacity building for SIDS to be able to adhere to any new proposal. RMI noted that the measure was the operationalisation of Article 30 of the Convention and if the Commission does not take SIDS’ interests into account they may be cut off from full engagement and effective participation."
WCPFC13,150,"EU considered CMM 2013-06 to be a little different from other measures in terms of what the exact obligation is. For EU, each proposal needed to analyse whether it constitutes a disproportionate burden on SIDS, but it was not a compliance issue. When a proponent submits a new proposal, the Commission examines whether it satisfies the requirement and, if not, the measure would not be considered/adopted but it is not that the proponent would be considered non-compliant."
WCPFC13,151,"USA noted that these issues were reflected in the draft proposal except that relating to CMM 2013-06, which was reflected on page 14. USA also considered that CMM 2013-06 put obligations on the Commission. The provision did not place an obligation on specific CCMs, so it would be difficult for TCC to assess it and for the Secretariat to provide information for them to do so. The Commission could choose at some point to revise the measure."
WCPFC13,152,"Later on 9 December, USA advised it had consulted with interested CCMs and there was agreement. However, the draft had become so complicated with track changes that USA instead produced draft decision language regarding WCPFC13-2016-DP20_rev1 in the form of a set of instructions for the Secretariat to prepare a revised document after the meeting."
WCPFC13,153,"The Commission also agreed to a request from Japan, supported by the EU, relating to paragraph 6 of CMM 2010-07 on sharks to amend the frequency of assessment changing from every two years to each year."
WCPFC13,154,"The instructions to amend DP20_rev1 that were subsequently agreed by the Commission on-screen were:   Regarding CMM 2013-06: Page 7 (frequency of assessment): Delete bracketed row for CMM 2013-06 Page 14 (2017 review): Delete two bracketed rows for CMM 2013-06 Page 19 (2018 review): Delete two bracketed rows for CMM 2013-06  Regarding CMM 2015-01: Page 15 (2017 review): For CMM 2015-01, para 20, change category from “i” to “collective” Page 15 (2017 review): Add row for CMM 2015-01, para 24, with category “collective” Page 20 (2018 review): For CMM 2015-01, para 20, change category from “i” to “collective” Regarding CMM 2010-07: Table 1 – increase CMM 2010-07 frequency from 2 years to every year 2017 review: for CMM 2010-07 include para 6 2018 review: for CMM 2010-07 include para 6"
WCPFC13,155,"Regarding the list of obligations to be assessed, the FFA members expressed concern over the lack of inclusion of paragraph 3 of CMM 2013-06, which relates to the impacts of new proposals on SIDS and territories. Other CCMs agreed that the provisions of that paragraph are very important, and that the Commission should assess its implementation. However, as currently worded, the obligation is placed on the Commission rather than on the proponents of new proposals, so it might be difficult for the TCC to review compliance in the context of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS). WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 23 of 361"
WCPFC13,156,"The Commission agreed that as stated in the measure, it has an obligation to apply these questions in considering new proposals; and that it will continue to do so using the current practice of having this task undertaken by the specific proponents in order to inform the Commission’s consideration."
WCPFC13,157,"The Commission also agreed that at its annual session in 2017, it would review paragraph 3 of CMM 2013-06 and consider possible amendments to facilitate assessment of its implementation in the CMS."
WCPFC13,158,The Commission adopted the updated list of obligations to be assessed by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (Attachment I). Proposal to amend Charter Notification Scheme (CMM 2015-05)
WCPFC13,159,"On 9 December, Japan introduced its proposal to amend the charter notification scheme (WCPFC13-2016-DP25_rev2). Japan had revised its first version after consultations with several members. The most significant revision was to paragraph 7, clarifying which party should report catch and effort to the Executive Director. CCMs wished to see the draft in writing. Japan advised shortly afterwards that the USA had proposed a paragraph to replace paragraph 7 in DP25_rev2. It would give reporting obligations to chartering states. Some further drafting took place in plenary which was circulated to the meeting as DP25_rev3 late on 9 December so that CCMs could see the draft in writing."
WCPFC13,160,"In response to a query from RMI about whether attribution related to catch and effort, USA confirmed that it had wanted a reference to reporting requirements under Commission decisions. This meant the attribution of catch and effort in the data submission and in Annual Reports Part 1 and 2."
WCPFC13,161,"Without consensus for USA’s proposed amendment of paragraph 7, Japan suggested reverting to the previous version for adoption. Some further drafting took place in plenary and there were no objections to the changes made onscreen."
WCPFC13,162,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2016-05 Conservation and Management Measure on the Charter Notification Scheme (Attachment J), which will replace CMM 2015-05. High Seas Special Management Areas"
WCPFC13,163,"FFA members introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP14, a proposed CMM for the special management of certain high seas areas. If adopted, the measure would prohibit transhipment in the Eastern High Seas Pocket (EHSP) Special Management Area that was created in CMM 2010-02, and extend the same conditions to five fully- or semi-enclosed areas of high seas adjacent to FFA member EEZs. It was noted that these areas are either difficult or impossible to access except by going through the surrounding EEZs. Currently, foreign fishing vessels and carriers are not obliged to report their entry or exit to most of these EEZs if they are not licenced to also fish in them, which complicates monitoring and increases the risk of IUU fishing in EEZ waters. FFA members reiterated their concern about longline vessels transhipping to carriers on the high seas and noted that the Commission had not been able to agree that high seas purse-seine transhipment should be prohibited, particularly in areas distant from port. These CCMs considered the high seas pockets to be a special case, with a unique status under the Convention which provides that “special attention” be paid to compatibility between CMMs and national measures established in EEZs for the same stocks. FFA members took the view that it is practicable to prohibit transhipment in these limited areas. For FFA members, coordinating the management of high seas fishing is one of WCPFC’s priority responsibilities. They can cooperate WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 24 of 361among themselves in the sustainable management and conservation of fish stocks in their EEZs, but only the Commission can deal effectively with high seas fishing."
WCPFC13,164,"Japan had some fundamental problems with the proposal. This CCM did not understand the logic of prohibiting high seas at-sea transhipment, noting that transhipment activity on the high seas is well monitored by observers. Japan advised it had difficulty accepting the prohibition and suggested there were other ways to monitor possible illegal transhipments. Japan felt there should be greater utilisation of FFA Surveillance Centre’s state of the art VMS technology to detect illegal at-sea transhipment, noting that it had raised the same subject at TCC. A Japanese delegate had visited the Surveillance Centre and been impressed with the technology. This would show when two vessels were floating side by side and might be engaging in high seas transhipment. With communications between the Surveillance Centre and the Secretariat, flag states can be requested to check what the fishing vessels are doing. Japan thought the proposal would increase the workload of fishery managers tremendously, including Japan’s, by introducing reporting obligations for entry and exit of these areas. As long as a VMS signal is available, Japan did not see the need for the measure."
WCPFC13,165,"Chinese Taipei could not support the proposal, noting there was a monitoring scheme to monitor high seas transhipment and carrier vessels have observers on board and coastal states can assess VMS data as per the Commission’s data rules."
WCPFC13,166,"China thanked FFA for including the map in the proposal, highlighting the five pockets. China noted that all the high seas areas were surrounded by national jurisdiction. This CCM supported Japan’s intervention that a transhipment ban in the many high seas pockets was not needed for the time being, with the exception of the EHSP. For China, a ban on transhipment in the EHSP could be supported as the EHSP had been a special area for six years."
WCPFC13,167,"EU supported the proposal, noting that each year it comments that the exception has become the norm regarding transhipment. EU wanted a ban on high seas transhipment. While it was not necessarily a source of IUU fishing, the practice has a high risk of being an occasion for irregular activities and as such should be avoided as much as possible. EU noted that its fleet does not tranship on the high seas, despite the costs this imposed on the vessels."
WCPFC13,168,"Korea noted that its vessels do not tranship in the high seas pockets but noted the fundamental concern of others. While recognising the FFA’s concerns, Korea could not support further burden being placed on its longline fleet by requiring vessels to report their entry into and departure from high seas pockets, noting the Flick the Switch arrangement was already in place."
WCPFC13,169,"The FFA Secretariat noted that the WCPFC VMS data to which the FFA Surveillance Centre has access is limited. It is only in respect of FFA members that have allowed the data to be viewed. FFA cannot provide full surveillance of the high seas areas, though if high seas VMS data could be provided, member CCMs would certainly welcome it."
WCPFC13,170,"The Chair noted that the Commission had discussed the issue of high seas pocket transhipment in many forms. The Chair noted the willingness to move forward on the issue of the high seas pockets and transhipment, and expected the discussion to continue in the future.  Port based initiatives"
WCPFC13,171,"FFA members introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP15, a proposal for port-based initiatives to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing. FFA members thanked CCMs that had encouraged them to submit the proposal as the stepping stone towards the Commission developing port-based MCS arrangements WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 25 of 361in the region. For FFA members, maintaining their sovereignty was fundamental in the development of such measures. The proposal was compatible with the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing and was a non-threatening foundation for the Commission to build MCS networks upon. The FFA proposal aimed to provide a mechanism for CCMs to volunteer their ports to be used for inspection purposes, and establish a cooperative means for CCMs to seek the assistance of port states in the WCPO to deal with vessels believed to have engaged in IUU fishing. It aimed to provide port states with the flexibility to determine whether they are able to assist other CCMs in requests for inspections, determining which port inspections might be undertaken, and assisting those port states that aspire to strengthen their port inspection regimes. FFA members were undertaking several initiatives towards strengthening port state arrangements and thanked WWF for its support developing the port inspector electronic reporting system. A port state measures gap analysis was underway, assisted by The Pew Charitable Trusts funding. FFA members thanked New Zealand for establishing a five-year programme to develop and enhance port state measures in FFA member countries, which will provide the resources and support to establish regulatory frameworks and operational tools to fight IUU fishing."
WCPFC13,172,"No discussions took place directly on this proposal, in light of there being two port state measures proposals submitted to WCPFC13. Subsequent discussions around the EU proposal on a WCPFC scheme for minimum standards for inspection in port (below) dealt with both proposals.  Port Inspection Minimum Standards"
WCPFC13,173,"EU introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP03, a proposal to implement port inspection minimum standards. EU considered it important for the Commission to equip itself with port state measures – an essential tool to fight IUU fishing. EU noted the FFA proposal did not have the same standards as the FAO Port State Measures Agreement, but it was a good first step. The Chair proposed discussing both proposals, then EU and FFA could work together to bring something back to plenary."
WCPFC13,174,"Chinese Taipei expressed its willingness to exert effort and fulfil responsibility as a port state and flag state, in support of the Port State Measures Agreement that came into force in June 5 this year.  This CCM had technical amendments to discuss with both FFA and EU for the adoption of a WCPFC port state measure."
WCPFC13,175,"USA continued to support port state measures in WCPFC, noting adoption of one of the proposals was an important first step and did not have to be the only step taken."
WCPFC13,176,"China noted a provision in the FFA proposal where if a CCM does not designate a port where a CCM has the resources to undertake inspections the requirements in the measure would not apply. China said this would give it flexibility, as it will not be ready to conduct port inspections for a couple of years. Later, China can designate ports to do so. China hoped this aspect would be retained in any measure which comes back to plenary for adoption."
WCPFC13,177,"FFA members confirmed that the intention was to allow an opt-in mechanism, which would also help FFA members that are developing their capacities in this area."
WCPFC13,178,"On 9 December, FFA Secretariat advised that it had worked in the margins on a revised version, which had been made available for CCMs the previous night. It was noted that positive support had been received from many CCMs, including some with previous concerns. EU advised that it had worked constructively with FFA, despite FFA’s proposal not being as ambitious, it was a welcome step in the right direction and for this reason it agreed that discussion should focus on FFA proposal which had integrated some of EU's concerns. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 26 of 361"
WCPFC13,179,China confirmed that the paragraph 4 had accommodated its concern.
WCPFC13,180,"Japan could not support the document at WCPFC13 as it had not had enough time to analyse it. Japan noted that port measures have bigger, delicate issues that needed to be taken into account."
WCPFC13,181,The Chair commented that there was no consensus to adopt port state measures at WCPFC13 but noted the discussions and the latest thinking which was contained in the FFA proposal in its revised form (WCPFC13-2016-DP15_rev1).
WCPFC13,182,"New Zealand thanked China for its constructive engagement, and noted that the Commission had made significant progress on port state measures in the last few years. New Zealand noted that CCMs could opt-in to the measure."
WCPFC13,183,Japan noted that it was conducting legal analysis of the FAO Port State Measures Agreement in considering the ratification and the timing was very delicate to be considering anything which deviates from that agreement’s provisions. Japan hoped it would be able to come to the Commission meeting next year with a much better. Port Coordinators Program
WCPFC13,184,"TCC12 (paragraphs 179-181) had recommended the continuation of the Port Coordinators Program and identification of a funding source. The trial programme commenced in 2015 following its establishment by WCPFC11 decision, and was in its second and final year, pending a decision on continuation by the Commission. The reference doc for this agenda item was WCPFC13-2016-26."
WCPFC13,185,"EU had welcomed the Port Coordinators initiative from the beginning as it helped build the necessary capacity for port inspection controls. However, EU expressed some concerns about the results of the trial, noting that of the three FFA members supported, only two succinct statements, without supporting data, were provided to the Commission. EU noted that SPC considered the program useful for data collection and asked for some additional information on this, including the situation before the trial and the additional data collected with the trial. EU still considered the initiative useful but wanted to better understand the program’s contribution and impact before agreeing to make it permanent. EU could support continuing the program for another year, with better reporting to be provided."
WCPFC13,186,"PNG, one of the recipient CCMs, noted it had not provided a report. PNG had participated to gauge whether the program would assist with capacity constraints at the port level. It had identified gaps and recruited a coordinator, but noted that if reporting requirements were to become burdensome and the distinction between Commission business and national business became unclear, PNG may not continue to participate."
WCPFC13,187,"Japan supported the concept of Port Coordinators in principle, as they contributed to preventing or detecting IUU activities. This CCM wanted to see the impact on the budget before a decision was made to support the continuation. Japan supported obligations to report on the activities and the establishment of terms of reference and some kind of template for reporting the activities of the Port Coordinators."
WCPFC13,188,"The Chair queried whether, based on PNG and EU’s comments, CCMs supported an additional year of the program, with budget discussions still to weigh up all the Commission’s priorities. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 27 of 361"
WCPFC13,189,"FFA members thanked the Secretariat and SPC for providing support and technical assistance for the trial programme. These CCMs considered it to be an effective mechanism with tangible outputs – building the capacity of those who implement the scientific and MCS programmes that feed in to the work of the Commission. FFA members supported the proposal to continue the programme, and noted the changes to the proposed terms of reference that address some of the administrative issues experienced over the trial period. It was noted that some CCMs originally intended to be part of the trial programme had been able to fund Port Coordinator positions domestically and did not participate in the trial. This meant others could have and the ability for CCMs to indicate their interest in the programme was a good addition to the terms of reference. FFA members considered it imperative that the determination of the Port Coordinator’s tasks remain with the head of the respective national fisheries agency, to ensure the position supplements the needs of the individual national monitoring programme. These CCMs hoped other CCMs saw benefit in this initiative and the Commission would extend the programme."
WCPFC13,190,"USA was conditionally prepared to move forward with the extension and expansion of the program, noting it required resources and there were many demands on the Commission’s resources. USA noted that FAC needed to consider the budget and advise if the resources were available before it could make a firm decision. As other CCMs were, USA was concerned about the lack of documentation on the benefits of the program for recipient countries and the Commission."
WCPFC13,191,"FSM expressed its appreciation to the Commission and those CCMs that supported the project, reporting that it had worked closely with the Secretariat and SPC for two years. Like PNG, FSM joined the project as a means to augment data collection. It was originally intended that it would be beneficial for Port Coordinators to be in the busiest ports in the region. FSM noted that the Secretariat was looking at means to provide capacity assistance in ports that want to improve their data collection activities; this was part of the WCPFC budget. FSM had benefitted significantly from the programme, allowing it to maintain personnel to do the work and collect the data. FSM noted it was already overburdened with reporting but had submitted the necessary reports. FSM was reassessing the continuation of national level data collection efforts that serve FSM’s national purposes and requirements imposed through WCPFC measures. FSM supported the extension and would take a back seat while it did this."
WCPFC13,192,Kiribati noted it had benefitted greatly from the programme and supported its extension.
WCPFC13,193,"Chinese Taipei supported an additional year, considering it a very important MCS component and assistance to SIDS. This CCM asked recipient countries to provide reporting which demonstrates the benefits and progress of the trial."
WCPFC13,194,"RMI noted that the Marshall Islands port is one of the busiest though RMI does not participate in the programme. PNG and EU had noted the lack of a standard developed for this work, noting that there was nothing to be assessed against. Provision of operational data remained an issue for RMI, and supported USA’s suggestion to develop a standard. An option was to develop the standards before committing the funding and rolling it over on a long term basis. RMI considered there to be more to do, and there were still some questions about the trial."
WCPFC13,195,The Chair asked whether the question was only of funding or whether more fundamental work needed to be done.
WCPFC13,196,"In response, RMI preferred tasking TCC with reviewing a set of standards regarding the Port Coordinators’ work rather than asking FAC to look for funding yet. RMI suggested that the work of the last two years including the original TORs be the starting point. And Japan supported asking TCC WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 28 of 361to develop standards, hoping the Commission would also request the Secretariat to develop a draft common format related to reporting, to also be discussed at TCC."
WCPFC13,197,The Commission noted the report of the WCPFC Port Coordinators Programme Trial 2015–2016 (WCPFC13-2016-26) and tasked TCC13 to further consider the recommendations to extend the Port Coordinators Programme. Proposal to amend CMM 2010-02
WCPFC13,198,"The Cook Islands introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP02_rev1, a proposal to ban transhipment in the EHSP. Cook Islands noted that China had joined the proposal. It had been revised to include comments submitted by other distant water fishing states and a revised version was available. Cook Islands noted that in 2010 the EHSP was designated as an SMA. The EHSP is located in the middle of an albacore tuna fishery and is surrounded by Cook Islands, French Polynesia and Kiribati. Since the adoption of the EHSP SMA measure, Cook Islands played an active role in monitoring the area, with regular joint patrols with France and New Zealand, bilateral operations with Kiribati and trilateral operations with Samoa and Tonga. Cook Islands advised that vessels were still not adhering to the required reporting, allowing illegal activities to potentially take place. There was a two-year timeframe for adoption of the ban which gave operators time to prepare. Noting concerns raised at WCPFC13 about the encroachment of rights to high seas areas, Cook Islands clarified that its proposal only applied to the EHSP."
WCPFC13,199,"On 9 December, Korea and Japan advised that they could support the revised version, while stressing that its acceptance of the EHSP measure did not constitute a precedent. Chinese Taipei shared the views of previous speakers and also supported the proposal."
WCPFC13,200,"Cook Islands noted the significance of the measure in improving management on the high seas, and the co-sponsorship of China was a small step towards greater coordination and cooperation between coastal states and distant water fishing states in the WCPO."
WCPFC13,201,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2016-02 Conservation and Management Measure for the Eastern High Seas Pocket (Attachment K), which will replace CMM 2010-02. Fisheries and Access Agreement Information"
WCPFC13,202,"EU introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP05, a proposal for a CMM relating to information on fisheries access agreements. Noting that each year it puts forward similar proposals, EU recalled that in 2016 the Review Conference on the UN Fish Stocks Agreement was attended by members of the Commission. The Conference adopted by consensus, so with the support of all WCPFC members, a resolution that encouraged greater transparency and strengthened the fight against IUU including by making fisheries access agreements publicly available, subject to confidentiality requirements. This was why EU had again submitted a proposal for transparency in fisheries access agreements. The proposal took into account the Conference-agreed requirement that all information provided shall be in line with domestic confidentiality requirements."
WCPFC13,203,"FFA members did not support the proposal. They explained that they did not fear transparency, which they provided in many ways including through the provision of operational data on all the tuna fishing that occurs within their EEZs and publicly available laws and Harmonized Minimum Terms and Conditions which set out access requirements. These CCMs considered the proposal to be anti-competitive, and noted the history of distant water fishing states using economic and political power to protect the commercial interests of their fleets and undermining the interests of SIDS. This proposal WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 29 of 361would strengthen the position of distant water fleets in bidding for commercial access to FFA member waters, particularly for those FFA members with or developing competitive tender processes. This would not be consistent with the obligation to recognise the special requirements of developing states."
WCPFC13,204,"USA supported the proposal, noting that greater transparency was important to the successful management of fisheries in the WCPO. USA noted that if it could not be adopted, USA hoped there would be movement on increasing transparency through another mechanism."
WCPFC13,205,"EU noted that in the UN forum some FFA members agreed to transparency and making agreements publicly available, but in the Commission they could not."
WCPFC13,206,"The Chair noted the repetitive discussions around this issue over the years and the Commission was still not close to consensus. She asked that those with the most interest and those with the most difficulties craft an alternative to meet the objective everyone shares, taking on board the stated concerns. AGENDA ITEM 6 — WCPFC IUU VESSEL LIST"
WCPFC13,207,"WCPFC13-2016-10_rev1 prepared by the Secretariat provides the relevant information, including recommendations from TCC12 related to the WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC13,208,"Cook Islands reported that it had come to an amicable conclusion with Vanuatu about the vessel ESSIEN 108, which TCC12 had provisionally nominated for the WCPFC IUU Vessel List, and the vessel could be removed from the provisional list. With no new vessels to be listed, the Commission accepted the TCC12 recommendation that the three vessels on the current WCPFC IUU Vessel List remain on it. It was noted that these vessels had been on the list for some years."
WCPFC13,209,"FFA members considered it of grave concern that the three vessels had been on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for several years, compounded by their appearance on other RFMOs’ IUU lists. With it clear that the operators of these vessels are disregarding fisheries regulatory frameworks, FFA members thanked the Executive Director for writing to flag States and RFMOs to attempt to locate these vessels. With no further information about these vessels, FFA reiterated that the Commission needs to be more innovative and collect information on the operators of these rogue vessels. To this end, FFA members suggested at TCC that the name of the master be included alongside the vessels on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List and support the subsequent TCC12 recommendation as a key step towards locating the perpetrators."
WCPFC13,210,"Regarding YU FONG 168, FFA members noted that it has been on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for seven years, and the flag state cannot locate the vessel. The last advice from the flag state Chinese Taipei was that through a notification by Thailand to IOTC this vessel was last known to have landed catch in Thailand in 2013. The vessel was listed on the IOTC IUU List in May 2015. RMI noted Chinese Taipei’s previous advice that the vessel’s licence was revoked in 2009 and the owner of the vessel has been penalised through repeated monetary punishment for violating the rules of not returning to port. FFA members asked for further information from the flag state about additional steps that may have been taken to locate and prosecute the operator. FFA members did not want vessels ‘parked’ in the WCPFC IUU Vessel List and advocated effort from all angles. These CCMs supported the Executive Director continuing to reach out to RFMOs for any more information on these vessels and owners. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 30 of 361"
WCPFC13,211,"Chinese Taipei noted that the YU FONG 168 had absconded in 2008 without coming to port and confirmed it was placed on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List in 2009. Acting alone, Chinese Taipei could not resolve the issue. This CCM noted that WCPFC was a platform for international cooperation and, as the vessel may be being protected by another country, a system for all CCMs to act was needed. Chinese Taipei reported that in 2016 it had adopted new deep sea fisheries legislation, which allowed for stronger measures to be taken against vessel owners."
WCPFC13,212,"FFA members noted that the Commission RFV includes the nationality of the master and requested that the master’s nationality be included alongside the master’s name on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. For vessels not on the RFV, FFA members requested that the flag state bear the responsibility of providing the name and nationality of the master by TCC13, for inclusion on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. FFA members flagged that they are looking into Persons of Interest, which will link unique identification details, such as passport details, to each master’s name and nationality. In doing so, FFA members would not just target vessels involved in IUU activities but the operator, and bring them to justice."
WCPFC13,213,"FFA members noted their concern about the number of recent incidents involving Vietnamese small scale boats conducting unauthorised fishing in FFA member waters, targeting beche de mer and other coastal species not directly under the purview of the Commission. These CCMs noted that these IUU activities significantly impacted the marine environment of coastal states and can affect the livelihoods of small island communities. Other impacts included additional costs imposed on states in taking action against these vessels. FFA members called on Vietnam to fulfil its flag state responsibilities in controlling these vessels and in cooperating directly when they are detected and apprehended."
WCPFC13,214,"FSM noted that in the past two years it has arrested nine illegal blue fishing boats, with approximately 135 fishermen. FSM has now categorized combating IUU fishing as a national priority, but noted the costs are high. FSM spent USD $200,000 on fuel alone this year. Other costs include salaries for maritime officers, prosecution costs and costs of detention. None of the blue boats were registered to fish in FSM’s waters, had transponders or were detectable on VMS. FSM government officials had met with Vietnamese officials but in FSM’s view Vietnam has not demonstrated concrete measures to address the issue. FSM asked Vietnam what action it had taken as a flag state against vessels violating its laws noting that some of the vessels had returned to FSM waters two or three times despite being arrested. FSM noted that IUU fishing in the Pacific undermines the rights of coastal states to regulate marine resources, resulting in the loss of national revenue and employment opportunities and impacting Pacific Islanders who depend on the oceans as a source of nutrition. It is a risk to the marine environment, threatens fish stocks, devalues fisheries and disadvantages those who abide by regional and national rules. FSM sought the Commission’s assistance in responding and called on flag states to combat IUU fishing."
WCPFC13,215,"Vietnam recognised it was a very important issue, but emphasised that the Vietnamese IUU vessels were not tuna vessels and were not targeting tuna. In 2015 Vietnam sent an official to FSM for high level meetings and set up a hotline to the FSM government. Vietnam was in the process of revising its laws to ensure nationals paid a high penalty for IUU activities."
WCPFC13,216,"PNG noted that despite being on the list for some years, no one had reported finding YU FONG 168. PNG asked whether the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels is cross-referenced with state vessel registries and whether it could be used to facilitate inclusion of the registered owner’s name on the list."
WCPFC13,217,China was able to go along with PNG’s proposal to add master’s name and nationality to the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 31 of 361
WCPFC13,218,USA associated itself with FFA members about the importance of addressing IUU fishing and asked for PNG to provide a proposal. PNG undertook to consult with USA in the margins and asked if the Secretariat cross-checked details from the vessel register with the Chinese Taipei vessel registry.
WCPFC13,219,"The Chair clarified for other CCMs that the TCC12 recommendation was to include the vessel master’s name in the list, and PNG’s new request was to include the vessel master’s nationality."
WCPFC13,220,"The Executive Director clarified that the Secretariat writes to the flag states of vessels that are on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List, as tasked by TCC. The Secretariat receives information from the flag state but has not conducted direct checks with the Chinese Taipei vessel registry. The Secretariat relies on flag states to provide them with that information."
WCPFC13,221,"RMI thanked Chinese Taipei for its earlier update about the vessel, and encouraged the Commission’s further work on the issue. This CCM queried the effectiveness of the WCPFC IUU Vessel List, if vessels can recur at different times in different oceans without being caught. RMI suggested it would be useful for TCC to look at the issues and come up with options."
WCPFC13,222,"On 9 December, PNG provided proposed language for plenary discussions regarding the inclusion of nationality of the master of the vessel to further help identify the vessel. PNG explained that vessel names are often duplicative across multiple registries. After a request for clarification, PNG explained that vessel master’s nationality is already included in the RFV data fields. The Commission would only be agreeing to include on the final WCPFC IUU Vessel List the vessel master’s nationality alongside the vessel master’s name which had already been agreed."
WCPFC13,223,Kiribati supported the proposed language on the basis that it is masters that operate the vessels and conduct the IUU fishing activities.
WCPFC13,224,The Commission adopted the 2017 WCPFC IUU Vessel List (Attachment L).
WCPFC13,225,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat with including the names of the vessel masters, if available, into the WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC13,226,The Commission tasked TCC with investigating options to address the circumstances of vessels remaining on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for many years.
WCPFC13,227,"The Commission agreed that: the master’s nationality is included alongside the master’s name into the WCPFC IUU Vessel List; and where the vessel is not listed on the Record of Fishing Vessels and the master’s name and nationality are not known, the flag State is responsible for providing the name and nationality of the master, so that these details can be included into the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. AGENDA ITEM 7 — SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES"
WCPFC13,228,This is a standing agenda item for the Commission under Rule 2 (h) of the Rules of Procedures. 7.1 Updated checklist evaluation of SIDS’ special requirements
WCPFC13,229,"At WCPFC11, FFA members tabled a checklist that set out SIDS’ specific needs to assist in prioritising the assistance received from the Commission and other CCMs. WCPFC11 agreed to consider the checklist as a “guide to assist developed CCMs to assess the status of assistance to SIDS”. An updated checklist has since provided. In WCPFC13-2016-DP16, FFA members laid out some WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 32 of 361views on their approach to the checklist to make it an effective and efficient tool. The checklist will continue to set out SIDS’ needs, especially as arising out of the CMR discussions. It will be based on the capacity needs identified in the Final CMR and updated accordingly after WCPFC13. FFA members requested that these are treated as immediate areas for priority assistance from developed CCMs and noted that the checklist could track progress or delivery of assistance for these specific needs. 7.2 CCM reports on the implementation of Article 30"
WCPFC13,230,"WCPFC13 took as read the report on EU’s implementation of Article 30 of the Convention and Resolution 2008-01 (WCPFC13-2016-DP27). The paper detailed assistance provided and proposed in future years. EU noted that capacity building assistance can also come from other kinds of assistance available in the region, not just through WCPFC. EU considered the checklist in CMM 2013-06 to be a valuable guide and noted that EU’s support was given to FFA to implement, so EU expected FFA would comply with the checklist when determining its priorities for the funding. EU commented that reporting from FFA on how it uses the assistance would be useful."
WCPFC13,231,FFA members thanked those CCMs that provided reports of their assistance or responded through their Annual Reports Part 2. It was noted that many of the reports did not provide sufficient information on targeted assistance under the categories in CMM 2013-07 or the SIDS Checklist. This made it difficult to properly review the implementation of the measure. FFA members requested that developed CCMs prioritise assistance to addressing specific areas identified for the SIDS Checklist to enable thorough analysis of the reports and linkages to the SIDS Checklist and implementation of CMM 2013-07.
WCPFC13,232,"Japan noted that it provided assistance in various forms for WCPFC assistance. Japan assists SIDS through its official development assistance, including Overseas Fisheries Cooperative Foundation (OFCF), enabling the construction of infrastructure and capacity building for artisanal fisheries, data collection and fisheries management. Since 2008 Japan has been assisting SIDS for capacity building in respect of statistics, and fisheries management and enforcement through the WCPFC Japan Trust Fund. Japan had pledged to provide no less than 55 billion Yen (around USD $5,000,000) in the next 3 years during the Seventh Pacific Leaders Meeting (PALM7) held in 2015. Japan also contributes to the Japan Promotion Fund agreement with the Forum Fisheries Agency. Japan sends fisheries experts to SIDS from JICA and OFCF and receives trainees from SIDS."
WCPFC13,233,"FFA members noted that several WCPFC13 proposals do not include a CMM 2013-06 SIDS’ impacts assessment or only cursorily attempted to complete the assessment. FFA members reminded proponents to fulfil this obligation, as it was a critical step to informing and reassuring SIDS that impacts on them have been taken into account when formulating proposals. CCMs should discuss proposals and their impacts with SIDS early. FFA members strong took the view that not conducting this assessment or not doing it in a timely or complete manner was a breach of CMM 2013-06. FFA members proposed that new proposals which do have no assessment or an incomplete assessment not provided in advance of the Commission meeting not be considered by the meeting and the proponent be considered non-compliant."
WCPFC13,234,Chinese Taipei noted that each year this issue is discussed but it was not clear how to establish criteria or a mechanism for CCMs to follow. Chinese Taipei proposed that the issue of the sustainability of the Special Requirements Fund (SRF) be discussed by FAC before consideration by WCPFC. This CCM noted the continuous demands on the fund and noted the Chinese Taipei Trust Fund to strengthen capacity building in WCPFC developing countries was USD$2 million beginning this year. Chinese Taipei encouraged SIDS to apply.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 33 of 361
WCPFC13,235,"FSM supported other FFA members’ statements and thanked developed states for their assistance. This CCM noted that Article 30 requires that capacity assistance be provided so SIDS can fully execute their obligations and participate in the work of the Commission. Part of the Commission’s work is to adopt CMMs, so when a proponent puts forward a measure which has implications for SIDS, if special assistance is required the proponents should outline how that assistance will be provided. FSM acknowledged resources including the SRF, the Japan Trust Fund and others, but emphasised that the issue at hand was the use of a checklist for proponents to outline the assistance they will provide so SIDS can implement their obligations and manage the resources. In the absence of that, FFA members would not be in a position to adopt the measure."
WCPFC13,236,"FFA members submitted WCPFC13-2016-DP17, a proposal to ensure the sustainability of the SRF, with a specific focus on participation at meetings. It was noted that the fund was near-exhausted for most of 2016. The dominant use of the fund has been to support SIDS’ travel to participate in WCPFC meetings. As the work of the Commission grows more complex and broad it is practically impossible for a single person to be across all issues, so meetings are meeting attended by at least two SIDS nationals per CCM. FFA members proposed that a compulsory amount be placed annually into the SRF. WCPFC13-2016-DP17 contains the specific financial formula. It was explained that the SRF would be drawn down as per current practice for an additional representative of a developing state member or for other needs such as internships or a national project. FFA members noted that meeting participation was the primary focus of the proposal, SIDS also need assistance to implement and comply with Commission measures."
WCPFC13,237,"Japan recognised the importance of assisting developing countries to participate in WCPFC meetings and supported a fund, but felt it should be voluntary not mandatory. Under its national system, Japan could not make mandatory contributions to the fund but it hoped other countries could do so. Another option would be to allocate from the regular budget to replenish the fund; FAC should explore the options."
WCPFC13,238,The Chair asked if CCMs agreed to the concept of making the voluntary fund mandatory.
WCPFC13,239,"Korea thanked those CCMs, including USA, which had made voluntary contributions to the fund, and recognised the need to replenish it. This CCM agreed that making it mandatory was an option, but it needed consideration. Noting the increase in the number of meetings which required in-person presence, this CCM suggested other ways, such as streamlining the number and efficiency of meetings."
WCPFC13,240,The Chair noted that a lack of consensus that the fund should become mandatory.
WCPFC13,241,China suggested that a percentage allocation from the regular budget could be an option.
WCPFC13,242,"Japan suggested looking first at voluntary contributions and if this is not possible the Commission could consider allocating money from the regular budget. The funding to be allocated would depend on the total budget, which was under discussion at FAC. Japan agreed that streamlining the number of meetings would help, noting that some meetings that have been held may not have been needed."
WCPFC13,243,"RMI noted that some of the proposals to WCPFC13 had not gone through the checklist, but stressed that this was not a stand-alone agenda item, it was about SIDS and their effective participation in Commission processes. This CCM noted that the balance of the SRF was USD $36,000, but the measures and obligations which require SIDS’ attention continue to increase. RMI emphasised that CMM 2013-06 and CMM 2013-07 were linked.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 34 of 361"
WCPFC13,244,"EU considered the checklist and the SRF were linked but separate. Internal EU rules precluded it from contributing to the SRF fund. But EU could support earmarking a certain percentage of the Commission budget for the SRF for attending meetings, similarly the case for IATTC. EU also noted that other sources of financing existed through other agencies in the region."
WCPFC13,245,Australia noted this was a core concern for SIDS and the FAC should consider these ideas. This CCM suggested that the ‘Travel’ line item in the core budget could be examined.
WCPFC13,246,The Chair noted that a number of options had been raised for consideration by FAC during WCPFC13. 7.3 Review of implementation of CMM 2013-07 (Paragraph 20)
WCPFC13,247,"In accordance with paragraph 20 of CMM 2013-07, the Commission reviews implementation progress of the Convention and CMM 2013-07 annually."
WCPFC13,248,"FFA Secretariat noted the valuable assistance CCMs provide and recognised that, taken together, it constitutes a huge body of support. Unless the questions in the CMM 2013-06 checklist are taken seriously, it is difficult for FFA members to discern if they have the capacity to take on an obligation. It was noted that CMM 2013-07 links to CMM 2013-06 and related to WCPFC measures and SIDS’ ability to participate in the work of the Commission. For example, one of the key priorities under the last EU-funded project in the Pacific was assisting countries to meet sanitary requirements to export to Europe – a very important project for SIDS but it did not enable SIDS to fill out the Annual Report Part 2 on time or conduct a minimum number of port inspections."
WCPFC13,249,"RMI expressed the view that the Commission is not in compliance with the Convention, with the responsibility for compliance resting on the Commission in the first instance then on each CCM. A number of proposals put to WCPFC13 did not address CMM 2013-06. This CCM suggested that proposed measures which have not been through a consultative process should not be on the agenda for discussion. The Commission and Secretariat should comply with the measure when reviewing proposals for the agenda. It was important for the Commission to understand that measures have impacts on SIDS, including in budgetary and technical capacity terms."
WCPFC13,250,FSM explained that the checklist identifies what might be required to assist SIDS. A process may be needed to allow for CCMs who are developing a proposal that funding could be attributed so it is clearly identified who is contributing and who is receiving assistance as a result of the measure.
WCPFC13,251,"EU sought clarification from FSM if this meant proponents would be expected to put up financial assistance in order to present a proposal, noting such a process does not exist in other RFMOs."
WCPFC13,252,"The Chair noted that this standing agenda item gives the Commission a chance to consider how measures affect its most vulnerable members. The Chair commented that SIDS’ issues flow throughout the whole meeting agenda and this item was an opportunity to discuss if proponents providing evaluations against CMM 2013-06 are meeting expectations regarding SIDS. It was clear work was still required. The Chair encouraged CCMs to continue discussions through the week with SIDS’ and capacity-related issues in mind. In addition, the FAC would discuss the sustainability of the SRF and report back.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 35 of 361AGENDA ITEM 8 — HARVEST STRATEGY"
WCPFC13,253,"Discussions under this agenda item focused on those elements of the agreed Work Plan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 specifically earmarked for decision in 2016 (see: WCPFC12 Summary Report, Attachment Y and WCPFC13-2016-IP02). 8.1 Management objectives (all species)"
WCPFC13,254,"The Work Plan requires the Commission to record the management objectives for the four species it covers. The Chair distributed draft management objectives in Circular No. 2016/34, which originate from Management Objectives Workshops (MOW) outcomes and were accepted by WCPFC11 (WCPFC13-2016-11b). These were circulated in July to give CCMs time to reconsider the draft management objectives as a starting point for discussions. The Chair noted that the USA had also proposed management objectives for one of the three fisheries that were discussed in the context of the MOWs."
WCPFC13,255,"USA explained that it had developed its proposal WCPFC13-2016-DP22 due to its reluctance to adopt a long list of candidate management objectives. USA agreed strongly with one aspect of the ‘strawman’ document and the Chair’s proposal: that the management objectives, and the harvest strategies as a whole, should be structured around fisheries not stocks. The USA proposal was limited to the tropical purse-seine fishery. It could serve as an example; if a set of objectives such as that contained in the proposal were acceptable, similar sets could be developed for the tropical longline fishery and the southern albacore fishery. Another important aspect of the ‘strawman’ document is its documenting of the connections among the fisheries, including competition and upstream-downstream links, and that aspect is incorporated in the USA proposal."
WCPFC13,256,The Chair noted that the question for discussion was whether or not the Commission supported the U.S. approach relating to the tropical purse-seine fishery or the MOW approach as contained in Circular No. 2016/34.
WCPFC13,257,"FFA members supported the Chair’s approach in Circular 2016/34 based on the MOWs. While the objectives do not exactly mirror the objectives of FFA members, they came from a process that involved independent experts and included all CCMs over a period of two or more years. They were a reasonable compromise and provided greater clarity than having no management objectives at all. FFA members considered the objectives be simply “recorded” rather than agreed, and that they be used to guide the development of further elements of the harvest strategy. The objectives would not be considered prescriptive and there is no expectation that every objective would be monitored and reported against as the Commission develops harvest strategies. FFA members did not support USA’s approach."
WCPFC13,258," Japan noted that harvest strategies are comprised of several elements, with management objectives just one of the parts. Until all the components were assembled, Japan could not agree any of the components without knowing the consequences, so its position on them would remain tentative until the finalisation of the whole. Japan raised a number of issues: the Harvest Strategy Work Plan required management objectives for skipjack, bigeye and yellowfin tuna, so Japan felt that it was more natural to look at each species rather than each fishery catching those species. For this reason the concept behind the U.S. paper was more difficult to understand. Japan asked for clarification around what it meant for the Commission to “record” management objectives. The Commission could add many management objectives, but some may be in contradiction to others, with a reconciliation process then needed. This CCM considered the discussion to be valuable but clarity around the future prospects of the work was needed, especially what happens after making the list. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 36 of 361"
WCPFC13,259,"EU noted there were merits to both approaches: USA’s was in line with the Convention language, notably as it refers to MSY; the Chair’s approach reflected discussions WCPFC13 had engaged in previously. EU had favoured continuing the MOW work and considered further work was needed on the approach in the Circular to refine the objectives as, like Japan had raised, there could be difficulties reconciling them. EU thought further discussions about what the Commission was trying to achieve was needed before recording or noting any management objectives."
WCPFC13,260,"Australia supported the Chair’s approach to recording management objectives, commenting that a key aspect was not the objectives themselves but how they are used to progress the harvest strategy approach. Australia noted that the Work Plan explicitly tasked the Commission to ‘record’ rather than ‘agree’ the management objectives, and commented that some of the objectives will conflict and some will require trade-offs. The objectives provide guidance for the Scientific Services Provider to develop the MSE framework and performance indicators. The MSE will allow the Commission to assess the performance of candidate harvest control rules and to objectively consider the trade-offs, which is similar to the approach taken in NC."
WCPFC13,261,"PNG supported the Chair’s approach and the precautionary approach to improving decision making, and did not favour starting from scratch."
WCPFC13,262,"Chinese Taipei suggested that the Commission needed more time to discuss priorities and management objectives, noting too many objectives were outlined in the Circular, with possible conflicts. This CCM hoped that the management objectives would generally follow the Convention text."
WCPFC13,263,"China considered that harvest strategies were a means of achieving the objectives of the Convention, which was the sustainable utilisation of tuna resources, so the reference points should be based on MSY. This CCM considered that discussing harvest strategies was premature until a common understanding was reached on this. China understood that all the reference points are linked with TAC –once MSY is established three reference points are used to reduce the level of TAC. China pointed out that we do not know the relationship between reference points with the VDS. It was noted that the VDS was an input control tool and reference points linked with TAC which is an output control tool. China was concerned that the reference point will only be applied to high seas fisheries, not those in areas of national jurisdiction. Two years ago the Commission adopted a TRP for skipjack tuna, but China noted that this TRP has not yet translated into management action. China wished to see the final product of the TRP in the bridging tropical tuna CMM, noting that fishermen need to know how much fish they can catch. Until then, China was unable to consider TRPs for other tuna species."
WCPFC13,264,"Japan acknowledged the time CCMs had spent on the MOW discussions, but noted that the workshops were to help CCMs learn about harvest strategies and the MSE process, and encourage frank discussions about them; the outcomes were not binding and the management objectives in the document did not represent the agreement of the working group. This CCM favoured developing a list of two or three management objectives, adding that they were used to evaluate different harvest strategies so should not be overly complicated. Japan suggested looking at the issue by species, with sustainability of the stock the guiding principle. Japan noted that both papers looked at certain types of fisheries, and queried what would happen to fisheries not covered, for example the skipjack fishery."
WCPFC13,265,"Canada supported continuing the discussions in a small working group. This CCM considered the management objectives outlined were an indicative and useful list, but agreed with Japan that it should not be considered an agreed, select list; there should be further refinement specific to the development of individual harvest strategies. Canada noted NC’s approach, which held technical meetings including WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 37 of 361scientists, managers and industry. This CCM underscored importance of the objectives being quantifiable."
WCPFC13,266,"RMI commented that further work was needed to refine the objectives, and noted the information provided by SPC in WCPFC13-2016-14. RMI supported recording management objectives as the Chair had circulated."
WCPFC13,267,"PNA members were pleased to see this work being undertaken at WCPFC13. These CCMs supported the work on harvest strategies and the application of the precautionary approach as a way of improving decision-making on management and conservation of key stocks and saw the potential benefits of having pre-agreed rules for how fishing will be adjusted as status of stocks change, and better taking account of uncertainty. These CCMs commented that harvest strategies were not a way of reshaping arrangements and approaches already agreed, except where necessary to ensure sustainability. On this basis, PNA would continue to strongly support harvest strategy outcomes that strengthen and do not undermine the rights of resource-owning CCMs to manage resources and fisheries in their waters compatibly with measures applied in other areas within the Convention area."
WCPFC13,268,"The Pew Charitable Trusts made a statement on behalf of PEW, WWF, Greenpeace, Conservation International, and SFP, noting these NGOs were pleased to witness WCPFC’s commitment to the Harvest Strategy Work Plan. It was noted that the aim for WCPFC13 is to ‘record’ some management objectives, not adopt them – they are not unchangeable. Harvest strategies are a package of elements, as noted by Japan, that are then ideally tested by MSE and modified if needed based on those analyses. These NGOs noted that it would be regrettable and a step backward if the Commission could not record a list of management objectives for consideration. It was noted that PEW and ISSF have produced explanatory materials as a contribution to this process, including case studies of harvest strategies in practice."
WCPFC13,269,"The Chair noted that the Commission had committed to developing harvest strategies going forward. The term ‘record’ stresses that the immediate goal was not a binding agreement, and followed the logic that everything is interim until everything is final. The purpose of circulating the ‘strawman’ document was to remind CCMs that they had already done a lot of work, discussions had been held with stakeholders and the Commission had received and accepted a report which discussed management objectives. The Chair appreciated the desire of some CCMs not to reinvent the wheel. It was also noted that this was the first year the Commission had taken a comprehensive look at the Harvest Strategy Work Plan. Though the MOW process had been discontinued, the compromise was to ensure management-level discussions took place at the Commission. The goal was not to find agreement but to find a basis for future work, perhaps an acknowledgement that these objectives could be used for the harvest strategies work. The Chair noted that WCPFC13-2016-14 reflects the other elements of the ‘strawman’ proposal – the indicators and the monitoring strategies. It may be that general acceptance of those indicators could point towards some implicit acceptance of the objectives they were developed against."
WCPFC13,270,"USA noted that two possible options were to start with a long list of possible management objectives and trim it, or start with a small list and expand it. Either way, the likelihood would be that with further discussions, the end point would be different to the start point."
WCPFC13,271,"Japan (Shuya Nakatsuka) offered to lead the small working group and, on 7 December, reported on its progress. Using the list within Circular No. 2016/34 and USA’s proposal, the group had tried to come up with a list of interim management objectives to be used solely for the purpose of MSE and the application of harvest control rules. They could be modified in the future. Japan noted that not all were agreed but the group was making progress. On 8 December, Japan reported that the group had WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 38 of 361finished discussions on a list of indicators for evaluating harvest control rules for tropical purse-seine fisheries though several significant issues had emerged."
WCPFC13,272,"On 9 December, Japan advised that the informal small working group had developed a list of useful indicators, without agreeing or disagreeing to them, noting that different management objectives had different levels of importance to different CCMs. A question was whether the work should be conducted for primarily skipjack tuna (though the group also touched on bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna) MSE only or for multiple species MSE."
WCPFC13,273,"The Chair noted that this work was in the context of the harvest strategies framework which was set out by species, not by fisheries. The Chair noted the cross linkages and emphasised that the Commission was not attempting to agree to a set of objectives at this stage but would note the work done by the informal small working group and the direction its output provided, primarily for skipjack tuna."
WCPFC13,274,"Australia noted that, for 2016, the Harvest Strategy Work Plan requires the Commission to record management objectives for all four species – skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye tuna and South Pacific albacore. Australia was pleased that the Commission had engaged in discussions around the management objectives and hoped these discussions continued at future Commission meetings. For 2016, the Commission was also scheduled to agree a monitoring strategy, including performance indicators, for skipjack tuna and South Pacific albacore. Australia acknowledged the good progress made on skipjack tuna and thanked the Chair of the informal small working group for his leadership. Australia proposed that the Commission task SPC with developing a relevant set of performance indicators for South Pacific albacore, proposing that SPC make reference to interim performance indicators for skipjack and South Pacific albacore tuna. This will allow the research provider to progress the development of harvest strategy-related work but also allow for further consideration and refinement by SC and WCPFC as necessary."
WCPFC13,275,"EU considered that the outcome fell short of the task WCPFC13 had for this meeting. WCPFC13 was supposed to have progressed further, across more species, and adopt management objectives. EU supported Australia’s comments, recognising that Australia had been the lead on the Harvest Strategy Work Plan’s development."
WCPFC13,276,"Japan noted that while also not necessarily satisfied with outcome, the exercise indicated how difficult it will be to agree management objectives. In the meantime, participants had learned about the process and come to understand that the Commission should not be so optimistic about formulating harvest strategies. The current management objectives mainly consider skipjack tuna caught in the tropical purse-seine fisheries and, from the outset, a consequential question was whether to look at species/stock, rather than fisheries. However, this CCM noted that positive and negative impacts of tropical purse-seine skipjack tuna fishing on other fisheries catching the same species and other stocks affected by those fisheries also needed to be taken into account. Japan welcomed the management objectives discussions, however if the outcome did not address the impacts of the fishery on other stocks Japan could not support it. Until there was a final product, Japan considered everything tentative."
WCPFC13,277,"Shuya Nakatsuka, in his capacity as Chair of the informal small working group, noted that for some of the indicators for other fisheries, SPC can provide information. But from a scientific point of view, he considered it premature to attempt fully fledged multi-species MSE and suggested asking SPC to conduct MSE based on the indicators, with as much information as possible for other fisheries, then consider how to approach multi-species MSE, which, it was noted, had been done nowhere else in the world. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 39 of 361"
WCPFC13,278,The Chair expressed optimism about the output which had been developed by the informal small working group – it had shown just how complex harvest strategies were. The Commission had understood in 2015 that its goals for the work were highly ambitious and aspirational. What the group had accomplished was realistic and reasonable considering how early in the process the Commission was in implementing harvest strategies. The Chair expressed the view that the Commission could task SPC to work on the management objectives which had been developed by the informal small working group.
WCPFC13,279,Korea commented that member cooperation in the informal small working group had resulted in some meaningful outcomes and noted its preference for a stock-based approach. From next year Korea wanted to work on management objectives and other relevant indicators for longline.
WCPFC13,280,"Fiji supported Australia’s comments, commenting that what was applied for skipjack tuna should also be applied for South Pacific albacore."
WCPFC13,281,"PNA members supported the group’s approach as set out in its report. The indicators provide a good basis for work towards MSE on skipjack and the purse-seine fishery, and for the development of indicators for other stocks and fisheries, especially albacore and the southern longline fishery. PNA members supported Australia’s proposal for further work on management objectives and performance indicators for south Pacific albacore and would work with SPC to progress this."
WCPFC13,282,Tonga supported Fiji and PNG’s interventions.
WCPFC13,283,"USA considered the outcomes to be a step forward, and noted that there were options about how to structure harvest strategies. USA wanted to approach the work from a fisheries perspective, not stocks, recalling that the harvest strategies framework intentionally leaves open both of those approaches. USA clarified that the outcomes of the working group were not for skipjack tuna, they were for the tropical purse-seine fishery. However, in USA’s view each identified indicator was very clear so it did not matter what it was called. USA supported accepting the outcomes from the working group. This CCM noted that some indicators were straightforward and could be monitored at no additional cost; others could bring substantial costs, so there was a need to proceed cautiously. Acceptance of the identified indicators did not necessarily mean the Commission adopts or commits to implement the strategies necessary to monitor the indicators. Such decisions would be made on a project-by-project basis, informed by SC advice and the expected costs of monitoring."
WCPFC13,284,"A short discussion took place about Australia’s proposal for SPC to work on similar indicators for South Pacific albacore. Tonga and New Zealand supported Australia’s comment, noting it was already scheduled in the Work Plan and highlighting the importance of South Pacific albacore for SIDS. China considered tasking SPC to do this work was premature. Australia clarified that it was suggesting work already required for 2016 under the Harvest Strategy Work Plan. While not set in stone, Australia felt SPC should go forward and do some of the work. China suggested further discussion among CCMs. Noting the ongoing work required to develop the specific objectives and indicators for south Pacific albacore, members acknowledged the benefit of SPC adapting the list of indicators developed for tropical purse seine fisheries to further similar work for south Pacific albacore."
WCPFC13,285,"The Chair characterised the work as preliminary and aligned it with the work being undertaken on the bridging tropical tuna measure, adding that to the extent possible the Commission should try to follow the Work Plan. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 40 of 361"
WCPFC13,286,The Commission accepted the suggested initial list of performance indicators for tropical purse-seine fisheries as developed by the Small Working Group on Management Objectives at WCPFC13 for the purpose of the evaluation of harvest control rules (This list is attached at Attachment M). 8.2 Acceptable levels of risk (all species)
WCPFC13,287,"The Commission is required to agree acceptable levels of risk for the four species covered by the Harvest Strategy Work Plan. Discussions on this began in plenary session, with brief introductions of the two proposals – FFA’s, which used interim risk levels of 5% for skipjack and South Pacific albacore with 10% for yellowfin tuna; and USA’s which used a risk level of 20% for South Pacific albacore."
WCPFC13,288,"FFA members introduced their proposal WCPFC13-2016-DP10 and expressed that they have advocated an interim risk level of 5% for skipjack and South Pacific albacore for some time, and 10% for yellowfin, considering risk levels to be consistent with the requirement to adopt risk levels that are very low, and that the social, economic and biological consequences of the risk levels are acceptable. These CCMs noted that the additional level of precaution captured in the risk levels for albacore and skipjack, reflects the relative importance and severity of the consequences of low levels of those two stocks. FFA members considered it premature to adopt a risk level for bigeye tuna as the first priority for this stock is to allow it to recover to the LRP. When that recovery is underway, the Commission can identify a suitable level of risk as a buffer above the LRP, and eventually implement a TRP. FFA members did not support the USA proposal of risk levels of 20% for all four key tuna species, disagreeing with the rationale for these higher levels of risk. The LRPs are biologically “precautionary” as required by the Convention, and FFA members did not consider them overly conservative. The Commission should take care not to introduce acceptable risk levels that erode the capacity of the LRP to provide strong protection. FFA members had issues with USA’s use of the interim IATTC limit reference point for skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna of 7% as evidence that the 20% WCPFC limits are overly conservative. These CCMs recognised that both proposals acknowledged that risk is not only about probability but also about biological, social and economic consequences. Economic and social impacts increase as biomass declines towards the limit and the ability to recover quickly is reduced once recruitment is affected, with costs associated with lengthy recovery periods, particularly for those communities that rely on fisheries most."
WCPFC13,289,"USA introduced its proposal WCPFC13-2016-DP23, a proposal for interim risk levels of 20% for all four stocks under CMM 2014-06. USA explained that the proposal is based in large part on the outcomes of SC12, which recommended “that WCPFC13 notes that levels of risk for breaching LRP should be considered coupled with the corresponding conservative or liberal nature of the LRP”.  The SC concluded that “the bigeye tuna LRP is viewed as conservative and could have associated higher levels of risk for breaching the LRP”.  The proposal is not based on the IATTC’s adopted interim risk levels. USA did not propose changing the limits WCPFC has adopted. FFA members’ proposed levels of risk are different for different stocks because of the relative importance FFA members place on the stocks – based on the social and economic consequences of breaching the limits. USA considered that the risk levels, which are tied to the limit reference points, should be based solely on biological considerations, drawing from the Convention and Annex 2 of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, which states that LRPs are intended to constrain harvesting within safe biological limits and TRPs are intended to meet management objectives. Unlike the USA proposal, the FFA members’ proposal does not include an acceptable level of risk for bigeye tuna, which could help inform what a reasonable rebuilding timeline would be for the stock."
WCPFC13,290,"An informal small working group was formed to discuss the proposals, led by Vice-Chair Russell Smith. On 7 December, the Vice Chair reported that participants had discussed their objectives and WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 41 of 361concerns about breaching the LRP for South Pacific albacore, skipjack and yellowfin tuna. With this input, SPC has a better understanding of what participants are trying to achieve. There was agreement on how to move forward on these three stocks but not for bigeye tuna and the group would return to the question today. The informal small working group also talked about the interim nature of the numbers and the iterative process towards full harvest control rules for these stocks."
WCPFC13,291,"On 8 December, the Vice Chair recalled that the task of the group was to consider for the four stocks the risk levels that would be applied in evaluating various harvest control rules and other instruments regarding whether there would be a breach of the LRP. There were robust discussions in the group and a text was largely agreed except for one set of issues requiring further discussion. The text provided that in reviewing the expected performance of harvest control rules or CMMs for these four stocks the Commission would consider any outcome that had a risk level of more than 20% of breaching the LRP as being inconsistent with the Convention. The text also addressed how to deal with stocks currently below the LRP. For those stocks there was an attempt to clarify that the Commission would look to specific rebuilding strategies to include a schedule and probabilities. There was some discussion in the informal small working group about how this decision would apply to CMMs."
WCPFC13,292,"On 9 December the Vice-Chair reported that a text had been developed to help guide work as the Commission continues developing harvest strategies and applying MSE. The Chair noted that the discussions were conducted in the context of the further evaluations SPC would be doing. In thinking about how the results would be found by those looking to utilise them, the Vice-Chair suggested an Annex to the Harvest Strategy Work Plan would make them more accessible and allow the Secretariat to more easily capture them and put them on the dedicated section of the website."
WCPFC13,293,"Following these discussions on acceptable risk levels of breaching a LRP, EU shared its views about the LRP adopted by WCPFC for skipjack, bigeye, yellowfin tuna and South Pacific albacore in the broader context of the harvest strategies framework. CMM 2014-06 (Annex 1) defines LRPs as references “intended to constrain harvesting within safe biological limits”. EU’s interpretation of this is that LRPs should be founded purely on biological considerations, and should therefore be defined on a stock by stock basis. In addition, LRPs have to be associated with level of risks commensurate with the degree of precaution considered when defining the level or value of the LRPs. Based on the most recent information available, EU noted that for some of the stocks, the SSB depletion level corresponding to MSY are just above or even below the general LRP of 20% SSBf=0 adopted by the Commission. EU was uncomfortable with the idea that one of the principles of the Convention “to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield” would be framed as “outside safe biological limits” for these species. EU proposed the Commission request SC13 to review the adopted LRP and proposed: i) stock specific LRPs that “constrain harvesting within safe biological limits”, updating accordingly CMM 2014-06, and ii) acceptable risk levels of breaching these LRPs that take into account their liberal or conservative nature."
WCPFC13,294,"Australia did not support EU’s proposal, considering this review work to have been done from Australia’s point of view, the WCPFC limit reference points are not overly conservative. The LRPs are biologically “precautionary” and therefore in line with the requirements of the Convention. The LRPs recognise the uncertainty associated with “steepness” (how much recruitment will occur at low stock sizes) and other aspects of tuna biology. This uncertainty makes quantities such as MSY extremely difficult to estimate without fishing the stock well below the point. This issue was explored extensively by SC7 in 2011 and ultimately resulted in the Commission adopting the current B20% limits which are precautionary with respect to the uncertainty. Australia noted that the Commission accepted the LRP to protect the biological productivity of the stocks, recognising uncertainty. The Commission should take care not to erode the capacity of the LRP to provide that protection. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 42 of 361"
WCPFC13,295,EU presented text late in the meeting for the Commission’s consideration but it was not agreed. New Zealand noted that a large body of work now existed and they were consistent with approaches taken by other national and international jurisdictions.
WCPFC13,296,"After discussion of the proposals of the FFA members and the USA, and based on the recommendation of the working group, the Commission agreed to: i) not specify, at this time, acceptable levels of risk of breaching the limit reference point for each stock; ii) consider any risk level greater than 20 percent to be inconsistent with the LRP related principle in UNFSA (as referenced in Article 6 of the Convention) including that the risk of breaching limit reference points be very low; and iii) determine the acceptability of potential HCRs where the estimated risk of breaching the limit reference point is between 0 and 20%. 8.3 Rebuilding timelines for bigeye tuna"
WCPFC13,297,"The Commission is required under the Harvest Strategy Work Plan to agree timelines to rebuild the bigeye stock to the LRP. Discussions began in plenary session and were continued in an informal small working group led by Australia. On 7 December, Australia noted that there had been useful discussions and strong engagement in the group about the time period for recovering bigeye tuna to the LRP. The participants agreed that progress was being made. It was clear that a number of timeframes were available to get to the LRP and many participants considered it achievable. The group looked at different timeframes and impacts on fishing activity, and also considered what the timeframes meant when built into overall harvest strategies; all are interim measures while the models are run. It was noted that bigeye does recover in reasonable periods of a time, though there may be a range of years rather than a fixed point in time."
WCPFC13,298,"On 8 December, Australia reported that the group had canvassed options around the timeframe for bigeye tuna rebuilding. Issues included the risk of achieving the LRP, the measures required to get there and impacts, although participants recognised that impacts were a matter for the bridging tropical tuna measure. There was a general view that the Commission could agree a 10-year timeframe to reach the LRP, then provide that timeframe to SPC to run the models and scenarios. Those model runs may throw up some alternative ways of getting there. Draft language would be circulated reflecting these discussions."
WCPFC13,299,"On 9 December, the draft text was discussed in plenary. Australia reported that the group’s recommendation was that an interim rebuilding period of 10 years could be applied in the development of measures (such as the tropical tuna measure) to rebuild bigeye tuna to the LRP.  This rebuilding period would be referred to by science services provider in modelling the likely outcomes of rebuilding measures."
WCPFC13,300,"China thanked Australia for its hard work in leading the group. Before the 10-year rebuilding period was agreed, China wanted to know the implications, including by what percentage fishing had to be cut down. China did not object to the timeframe but hoped it was not compulsory."
WCPFC13,301,"Japan also stressed the interim nature of the 10 year timeframe. If the Commission sets parameters that are too harsh, it could reduce the timeline or reduce the probability.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 43 of 361"
WCPFC13,302,"Australia explained that there were a number of scenarios and 10 years would be the target provided to SPC as an interim timeline. SPC would do the analysis to show how that could be achieved then report back to the Commission. 10 years was not a target, it was a number for SPC to use."
WCPFC13,303,The Chair emphasised that the timeframes were interim and were to inform ongoing processes.
WCPFC13,304,"In accordance with the Work Plan for the adoption of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-05, the Commission is scheduled to agree a timeframe for rebuilding bigeye tuna to [or above] its LRP."
WCPFC13,305,The Commission agreed to an interim timeframe of up to ten years for rebuilding the bigeye tuna stock to the agreed Limit Reference Point of 0.2SBF=0.
WCPFC13,306,"The Commission shall use this timeframe in its development and evaluation of strategies and conservation and management measures relevant to the rebuilding of bigeye tuna. Amongst other matters, the Commission will consider the probability of the bigeye stock being at or above the limit reference point at the end of the rebuilding timeframe. 8.4 Target reference point (South Pacific albacore)"
WCPFC13,307,"The Commission is required under the Harvest Strategy Work Plan to consider a TRP for South Pacific albacore. FFA presented WCPFC13-2016-DP09, noting it was not a new proposal. The text in WCPFC13-2016-DP09 emerged from a working group at WCPFC12 after consultations. It had not been possible to finalise the South Pacific albacore TRP proposal at that meeting, but FFA members hoped to gain agreement at WCPFC13. These CCMs noted why FFA felt it could be adopted as an interim TRP this year: the Commission has already set a precedent for agreement of an interim TRP that has bioeconomic dimensions in the skipjack TRP last year; FFA has engaged in further consultations with interested CCMs, and there is a better understanding of each others’ goals and constraints, and how all can benefit from a TRP that would allow different harvest control rule scenarios to be tested for the South Pacific albacore stock, including the potential for acquiring or maintaining MSC certification; and the agreed Harvest Strategy Work Plan timeframe for agreeing this TRP is one year overdue and no other proposals have been tabled. FFA expressed that they hoped to move forward with a cooperative mechanism to manage catches of South Pacific albacore within their EEZs, but recognised it was difficult without an effective limit on the high seas component of the fishery. The interim TRP would provide the foundation parties can work within. FFA members do not have the capacity to use all the South Pacific albacore fishing opportunities within their EEZs and many will continue to rely on partnerships with distant water fishing fleets. Improving the profitability of individual vessels can only be achieved by maintaining catch rates. These CCMs noted that a TRP is essential for the development of a harvest strategy and looked forward to identifying a mutually acceptable one. Discussions began in plenary session and were continued in an informal small working group led by Samoa.  Late on 9 December, a draft text was discussed in plenary."
WCPFC13,308,An informal small working group led by Samoa met on 6 and 8 December to discuss the proposal in WCPFC13-2016-DP09 for a Conservation and Management Measure to define an interim Target Reference Point for the South Pacific Albacore stock.
WCPFC13,309,"The SWG noted from the report of SC12 that the stock was not overfished relative to the 20% SB/SBF=0 LRP and that overfishing was not occurring relative to F/FMSY, but that stock is not in equilibrium. Biomass and CPUE continues to decline and that if current levels of longline effort continue there is a 19% probability of the stock breaching its Limit Reference Point within 20 years. The SWG noted the SC12 Management Advice that “longline fishing mortality and longline catch be WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 44 of 361reduced to avoid further decline in the vulnerable biomass so that economically viable catch rates can be maintained.”"
WCPFC13,310,"The SWG considered the implications of different options for restoring the stock to the proposed Target Reference Point over a period of up to 20 years, ranging from a large immediate cut in effort to a series of small cuts, informed by a bioeconomic projection analysis presented by SPC and FFA."
WCPFC13,311,"A majority of CCMs in the informal small working group indicated their interest in negotiating an interim TRP for the stock against the starting point proposed by FFA members of 45%SB/SBF=0, but China was not yet in a position to enter such a negotiation until the implications of different TRP levels were better understood in terms of the catch or effort changes that would be required to restore and maintain the stock at the TRP and noting that China is still observing how the skipjack TRP is functioning."
WCPFC13,312,The SWG was thus unable to recommend that WCPFC13 adopt the interim TRP proposal in WCPFC13-2016-DP09. The following three decisions were agreed to be included in the WCPFC13 record:
WCPFC13,313,"WCPFC13 requested that existing analyses of the implications of different TRP levels – in terms of total catch and effort changes required – should be re-circulated to CCMs by FFA before the end of December 2016, and that the Scientific Services Provider assist CCMs in understanding the economic implications of different TRPs for their vessels before SC13."
WCPFC13,314,"WCPFC13 agreed to defer the possible adoption of an interim Target Reference Point for the South Pacific Albacore stock, which had originally been agreed to take place in 2015 under the Harvest Strategy Work Plan, until December 2017 at the latest."
WCPFC13,315,"The Commission directed that further discussion of the TRP should take place over the course of 2017 as part of the ongoing consultative process for the development of a Bridging Measure for the Conservation and Management of the South Pacific Albacore stock, and should include a report on progress by the Convenor of that process to the 13th WCPFC Scientific Committee."
WCPFC13,316,"FFA members noted that the interim Target Reference Point for this stock agreed by the Participants to the Tokelau Arrangement remains in effect, and that this interim TRP would continue to guide their management measures and actions in areas under their national jurisdiction until superseded by a substantive TRP. Tokelau Arrangement Participants or the Parties to the South Pacific Albacore Catch Management Agreement will provide annually to the Commission the Total Allowable Catch of south Pacific albacore in waters under their national jurisdiction guided by this interim TRP. They drew the attention of other CCMs to the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention, particularly paragraphs 2b.i, 2c and 2d."
WCPFC13,317,"Australia noted with disappointment that despite the willingness of most CCMs, the Commission was unable to reach agreement on a TRP for South Pacific albacore. Australia strongly encouraged any CCM that does not recognise the urgency for the development of a TRP and ultimately a harvest strategy for this stock, or does not fully understand the benefits of these, to consult the substantial existing work on this matter and engage with the Scientific Services provider to clarify any issues, refer to the wide range of harvest strategies that have been implemented across the world, including by CCSBT and CCAMLR, engage constructively in discussions with CCMs on this matter over the next 12 months, and come to WCPFC14 with a fresh outlook and a willingness to contribute to a WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 45 of 361decision on the TRP level that will be of benefit to all countries interested in maintaining South Pacific albacore as a sustainable fishery that continues to provide economic benefits. 8.5 Harvest control rules (South Pacific albacore and skipjack)"
WCPFC13,318,"The Chair noted that the key outcome was that the Commission was moving forward with harvest control rules, on the understanding that SPC will do further work and report back to WCPFC14."
WCPFC13,319,"Japan noted that the management strategies work would be interim until a whole package is available. Japan supported SPC doing the work, though expressed some concerns about the budget."
WCPFC13,320,"EU acknowledged the budget was a challenge and announced that EU would provide €100,000 to underpin the work advancing harvest strategies in the Commission. EU was thanked for this contribution. 8.6 Management strategy evaluation (South Pacific albacore and skipjack)"
WCPFC13,321,There was no discussion under this agenda item.  8.7 Monitoring Strategy (South Pacific albacore and skipjack)
WCPFC13,322,There was no discussion under this agenda item. 8.8 Review of Work Plan
WCPFC13,323,"The Chair emphasised that while a number of aspects of the Harvest Strategy Work Plan are aspirational, it was incumbent on the Commission to keep the harvest strategy elements going forward. It was noted that 2016 was the first year the Commission had focused on work under the Harvest Strategy Work Plan, and the Commission may not be able to progress everything it hoped to each year. At the request of the Chair, Australia led work in the margins to review the Harvest Strategy Work Plan, which is required of the Commission annually. After meetings in the margins, an updated Work Plan was presented to the Commission for adoption which incorporated consultation discussions and took into account SPC’s capacity to do the work."
WCPFC13,324,"China advised that it could support the revised Work Plan, noting it was a “strawman” which could be changed, especially as regards South Pacific albacore."
WCPFC13,325,"PNG expressed some concern about one of the decision points by 2019, noting it referred to specific work PNA was progressing. PNG wanted to review how it fit with PNA’s planned work. This point was removed from the updated plan."
WCPFC13,326,"The Commission adopted the Updated Harvest Strategy Work Plan (Attachment N). The Secretariat was tasked with documenting progress achieved under the Harvest Strategies agenda item in the form of an annex to the Harvest Strategy Work Plan to serve as a reference document to track progress against the agreed work plan.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 46 of 361AGENDA ITEM 9 — WCPO TUNA STOCKS  9.1  General overview of stock status (bigeye, Pacific bluefin tuna, skipjack, North Pacific albacore, South Pacific albacore and yellowfin)"
WCPFC13,327,"Dr John Hampton (SPC-OFP) presented a summary of the status of tropical tuna fisheries and stocks, noting that the presentation summarises fishery information provided in WCPFC-SC12-2016/GN-WP-01 and stock status information contained in the various assessment reports presented to SC in recent years. Total estimated catches in 2015 were similar to the levels of 2012 and 2013, but was nearly 200,000 mt below the previous record catch in 2014 (2,882,511 mt). In the purse seine fishery, effort by the international large vessel fleet declined by about 20% in 2015 compared to 2014. This occurred because many vessels opted to not fish for parts of 2015 because of difficult economic conditions in the fishery. As a result the catch of skipjack, yellowfin and particularly bigeye tuna declined in 2015. CPUE has remained relatively stable at a high level since mid-2013, with some reductions during the FAD closures. VMS trip-length data indicate that high CPUE continued in 2016, including the first half of the FAD closure period. ENSO has a large effect on the purse seine fishery, with the El Nino conditions experienced in 2015 and early 2016 pushing the fishery to the east. The ENSO index has now moved back into the neutral range and is expected to remain so through at least mid-2017. In the tropical longline fishery, effort has increased over the past two decades, but has levelled off to some extent in the recent few years. There were reported declines in effort and catch in 2015, however these estimates may be under-reported and subject to later revision. Both yellowfin and bigeye CPUE in the fishery have declined over the long-term, but there has been a recent spike in the CPUE for both species. Effort and catch have also increased strongly in the southern longline fishery, but have levelled out in the most recent years. CPUE for albacore has declined over a long period of time. The stock status of the main tuna species was summarised as follows:   Skipjack – spawning biomass is close to the target reference point of 0.5 of the unfished level and fishing mortality is below the MSY level. The stock is therefore not overfished and is not experiencing overfishing.  Yellowfin – spawning biomass has been reduced to approximately 40% of the unfished level and fishing mortality is below the MSY level. The stock is therefore not overfished and is not experiencing overfishing. However the fishery is unlikely to be able to sustain any further increases in catch.  Bigeye – spawning biomass has been reduced to around 16% of the unfished level, less than the limit reference point of 20%, and fishing mortality remains above the MSY level. The stock is therefore in an overfished state and is experiencing overfishing.  South Pacific albacore – spawning biomass has been reduced to approximately 40% of the unfished level and fishing mortality is below the MSY level. The stock is therefore not overfished and is not experiencing overfishing. However the biomass available to the longline fishery has been depleted to the point where profitable fishing operations are threatened. Continued exploitation at current levels will further reduce the stock and result in approximately a 20% risk of breaching the limit reference point."
WCPFC13,328,"EU considered that a presentation about ‘key tuna stocks’ should include Pacific bluefin tuna, not just the tropical tuna stocks. Without Pacific bluefin tuna, the SPC presentation could perhaps be called ‘South Pacific albacore and tropical tunas’.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 47 of 361"
WCPFC13,329,"In response to a query from EU about the MSY level for different species, Dr John Hampton explained that MSY varies by species due to subtle dynamics of the different stocks, with the overall selectivity of the fishery (for example, longline fleets catch mostly larger adult fish) the most important factor. For skipjack tuna, the spawning biomass at MSY is around 25% of unfished levels, for yellowfin tuna around 30% of unfished levels, for bigeye tuna just over 20% of unfished levels and for albacore tuna around 15% of unfished levels. Where fishing takes place on the older part of the stock the level of spawning biomass depletion corresponding to MSY conditions tends to be lower, but where there is more balanced exploitation over the size structure, a higher stock size is required to support MSY."
WCPFC13,330,"Japan queried the stock assessment models used, noting that it was scientifically not possible to select a base case from various sensitivity runs because of the lack of likelihood profile and clear explanation for the selection of the value of over dispersion in tagging information in the reference case.  In response to SPC’s additional analysis provided in response to some CCMs’ concerns at SC12, including Japan’s concerns, this CCM stated that there remains concern about the over-weighting of tagging data and thus would like to continue to discuss with SPC."
WCPFC13,331,"Dr John Hampton responded that SPC had undertaken follow-up analyses of skipjack tuna after SC12 which addresses all of the queries which had been raised by some CCMs at SC12. In particular, SPC re-ran the models with a different spatial stratification which resulted in a slightly more optimistic picture than was presented at SC12. The models included more diagnostics and different hypotheses regarding natural mortality."
WCPFC13,332,"FFA members thanked SPC for the additional work to test the robustness of the 2016 skipjack stock assessment (WCPFC-SC12-SA-WP04a). These CCMs requested the following statement be placed in the WCPFC13 record: “FFA member CCMs commended the WCPFC Scientific Services provider for the world-class assessment of the skipjack stock that had been provided to the Commission in 2016. FFA members recognized that the relatively large amount of data, both operational data from fisheries and independent data from tagging and biological studies, had contributed to the quality of this assessment, but they also recognized the value of the primary modelling tool – MULTIFAN-CL – and its ability to provide a more spatially-explicit assessment than other models, allowing the assessment to be broken down into subregions. This spatially-explicit model, coupled with extensive tagging data, has given the Commission a much better appreciation of the connectivity and potential extent of interaction between the skipjack in different subregions than has been possible in other RFMOs.”"
WCPFC13,333,"In response to a request for clarification from Tonga regarding yellowfin tuna which, although not overfished, had a declining CPUE, Dr John Hampton noted that yellowfin tuna catches have been fairly stable for a long period of time, despite increasing effort. This indicates that it is not likely that fleets will be able to catch more yellowfin tuna than they currently do, which is in line with the SC12 recommendation that yellowfin tuna catches should not increase."
WCPFC13,334,"Japan noted the differing views on the stocks status of skipjack tuna at SC12, where Japan, China and Chinese Taipei did not agree to the results of the stock assessment provided by SPC, concerned that more data was needed for a more certain stock assessment result. Japan noted it was making efforts to collect more data."
WCPFC13,335,"Dr John Hampton noted that points of uncertainty existed with any stock assessment. For this reason, SPC scientists undertake a range of alternative model runs and try and characterise the uncertainty in the key results. While the range of models provides a range of outcomes in terms of spawning biomass depletion, the stock status conclusions remain consistent across the full range of the models explored. In particular, none of the models indicate that current levels of exploitation pose WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 48 of 361any significant risk of causing overfishing or of the stock approaching the limit reference point. SPC therefore has a high degree of confidence in the conclusions of the assessment."
WCPFC13,336,"PNA members supported FFA’s statement for the record and expressed their disappointment at any efforts to manipulate the outcomes of the scientific assessment of skipjack at SC12, which was particularly regrettable because it is related to the work on a harvest strategy for skipjack and it undermines the application of a harvest strategy approach and the precautionary approach to skipjack. PNA members could not accept this kind of approach with a stock of huge socio-economic importance to the people of the PNA states."
WCPFC13,337,"Japan recalled that SPC provided several scenarios and had explained that each scenario was equally plausible. In Japan’s view, if each scenario were equally plausible there should be a range of scenarios, rather than one chosen scenario. Japan agreed that there is always uncertainty, but hoped the quantum of uncertainty would be minimised in the future. Japan appreciated the additional assessment which was conducted and thanked SPC for its efforts. Japan’s main concern was the weight of the tagging data; Japan could not accept using the reference case provided by the base case. Japan agreed that the skipjack stock status was not of concern, so SC was able to reach consensus around the conservation advice, but emphasised that in its view there was no scientific case to choose one specific base case. Japan agreed to provide operational data to SPC to help measure stocks, while maintaining data confidentiality."
WCPFC13,338,"EU considered the skipjack tuna stock assessment undertaken by SPC to be robust and expressed surprise in the lack of confidence in the assessment result. Several models were run and all came to similar conclusions. EU commented that having ranges instead of picking one scenario has implications stocks beyond skipjack, and hoped Japan could go along with the 2016 skipjack stock assessment."
WCPFC13,339,"New Zealand supported the comments of EU and FFA members, considering the skipjack tuna stock assessment to be of a very high standard. This CCM recognised Japan’s comments about providing operational data and noted this would contribute positively to future stock assessments. 9.2  Review of CMM 2015-01 (bigeye, skipjack, yellowfin) 9.2.1 Review paragraphs 18, 25, 26, 28, 40, 43, and 61"
WCPFC13,340,"Paras. 18, 25, 26, 28, 43, and 61 contain those aspects of CMM 2015-01 that required the Commission’s consideration for the measure’s continued operation in 2017. The Secretariat prepared a reference paper (WCPFC13-2016-16_rev1)"
WCPFC13,341,"Dr Graham Pilling (SPC-OFP) presented a review of CMM 2015-01 for bigeye tuna (WCPFC13-2016-15). Both the performance of the fishery components (purse seine and longline) against the measure as written for 2015, and the potential for the CMM as written for 2017 to achieve its objective of removing bigeye overfishing. The evaluation indicated that purse-seine FAD set numbers and longline bigeye catch levels in 2014 were respectively ‘on track’ and ‘provisionally on track’, with the levels of effort and bigeye catch anticipated to arise under the CMM specifications for that year. A separate analysis examined whether full implementation of the CMM, under the conditions specified for 2017 would ultimately removing overfishing of bigeye tuna. The challenge was that it was not possible to define precisely what levels of purse-seine effort and longline catch would result in 2017, due to “either/or” choices within the CMM (e.g. purse-seining CCMs could choose between a three month FAD closure and overall FAD limit, or a four month FAD closure), exemptions and exclusions, and decisions yet to be made. Three different scenarios for 2017 conditions were therefore used to WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 49 of 361examine this implementation uncertainty, but Dr Graham Pilling noted that there is no certainty any of them will be correct. The scenarios were: ‘pessimistic’; ‘2016 choices’; and ‘optimistic’. Only under the ‘optimistic’ scenario were CMM objectives achieved by 2032, with F less than FMSY and no risk of the spawning biomass being below the LRP. Examining the trajectory of F/FMSY assuming the optimistic scenario conditions remained in place after 2017, CMM 2015-01 objectives would be achieved on average 7 years after the end of the measure, i.e. in 2024. As WCPFC stock assessments generally report fishing mortality conditions three years in the past, this would imply that only in 2027 would stock assessments identify whether the CMM had been successful. However, Dr Graham Pilling noted that earlier stock assessments should identify if the trajectory of F/FMSY and risk of SB < LRP are ‘on track’ to achieve objectives"
WCPFC13,342,"The Chair noted the importance of this information as WCPFC13 considers the bridging measure, to inform discussions in the informal small working group, especially regarding the rebuilding timelines for bigeye tuna."
WCPFC13,343,"Japan noted that whereas when the current measure was agreed it was expected that FMSY for bigeye tuna would be reached by 2017, under the optimistic scenario it would take seven years to get to FMSY, and asked whether this was correct. Secondly, Japan commented that the optimistic scenario indicated a chance to revert from F to FMSY only, but asked how realistic this was. Regarding recruitment, the assumption was that recent good recruitment would continue to 2032, but Japan believed this was too optimistic. Fourthly, Japan commented that converting F to FMSY would probably not be possible because there were too many exemptions, for example some CCMs had greatly reduced their longline bigeye catch but at the same time bigeye catch increased because of increasing the number of longline vessels without limitation. Without exemptions, a brighter picture could be assumed than currently."
WCPFC13,344,"Regarding the timeframes for rebuilding or reducing fishing mortality, Dr Graham Pilling observed that as SPC had noted in the paper, the language in paragraph 3 of the CMM was open to interpretation, but the discussions taking place at WCPFC13 about bigeye tuna rebuilding timeframes would help to clarify it. On whether further reductions might be required, 2015 levels of purse seine effort and longline catch sat somewhere between ‘2016 choices’ and the ‘optimistic’ scenario, but the question was whether 2015 conditions and positive recruitments would continue for the next seven or eight years. Thirdly, SPC noted that there was the possibility of some bias in the estimates of early recruitment in the bigeye tuna stock assessment, which was reduced when information on numbers of small fish provided by purse seine fishery data entered the assessment. As a result, SC6 had agreed that the more positive recent recruitment assumption be used within bigeye projections. SPC captures uncertainty in the projections by sampling future recruitments, but had also run projections under a less positive future recruitment assumption, and that was presented within the paper. Regarding exemptions, SPC has not been able to evaluate the consequences of all the exemptions in the CMM, as some were very difficult to evaluate within the approach. If there were no exemptions, it would be easier to analyse the CMM and generally the results would likely be more optimistic."
WCPFC13,345,"In response to a series of questions from China about fleet effort, U.S. territory 2000 mt bigeye catch limits, and the consequences of 4th month FAD closure on the rebuilding time, Dr Graham Pilling noted that the majority of the longline catch is by fleets with CMM catch limits, but the smaller catch of non-limited fleets has increased. Regarding the 2000 mt territory limit, Dr Graham Pilling noted that the U.S. CMM limit plus the 2000 mt limit for each of its three territories was assumed under the pessimistic scenario. Dr Graham Pilling also noted that if there was no 4th month FAD closure the results would be more pessimistic."
WCPFC13,346,"Korea provided some information to the Commission about the Korean fishing fleet’s longline catch in 2015. Due to domestic reporting data changes with the introduction of its e-monitoring system, WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 50 of 361Korea assumes around 3000 mt is missing from the data. While the reconciliation is yet to be finalised, Korea noted this may affect the scenarios."
WCPFC13,347,"Dr Graham Pilling noted that an increase of 3000 mt would increase the multipliers used in the scenarios. It might, for example, lead to an increase in the longline catch scalar of around 5% in the optimistic scenario."
WCPFC13,348,"PNA was concerned about the effect of under-reporting of bigeye catches in the longline fishery and asked SPC how the results of this evaluation would be affected by such under-reporting, and non-reporting."
WCPFC13,349,"Dr Graham Pilling noted that uncertainty in catches would affect the analysis in two ways. Firstly, identifying unreported catches would lead to increases in the multipliers SPC uses for the projections, and reduce the evaluated effectiveness of the measure. Secondly, as the projections are based on the bigeye stock assessment, changes in historical catch levels would increase uncertainty in the assessed current status of the stock; this would increase uncertainty in the evaluations performed."
WCPFC13,350,"Japan noted that para 3. of the measure provides that ‘the fishing mortality rate for bigeye tuna will be reduced to a level no greater than FMSY, i.e. F/FMSY ≤ 1. This objective shall be achieved through step by step approach through 2017 in accordance with this Measure’ and expressed the view that there was no ambiguity. Japan’s interpretation of this provision is that removal of overfishing of bigeye tuna will be achieved in 2017. Secondly, Japan understood that two elements make evaluation of the CMM difficult: the many exemptions; and the ability for members to choose between one measure and another, and suggested this be considered when developing the new measure. Thirdly, Japan stated that the current CMM cannot accomplish the objective to remove overfishing of bigeye tuna by 2017. Fourthly, Japan pointed out that 2010 FAD set levels was an important discussion point in development of current measure and requested SPC to provide advice on FAD set levels that could remove overfishing of bigeye tuna for the development of the new measure."
WCPFC13,351,"Dr Graham Pilling noted that 2010 FAD set levels was identified as one element of the fishing conditions that could remove bigeye overfishing within previous projection analyses, and that SPC has generally identified different combinations of purse-seine FAD set levels and longline catch limits that could achieve this aim. This could be done for the successor CMM."
WCPFC13,352,"PNA members considered that the 2017 stock assessment should take under-reporting of longline bigeye tuna catches into account, including the resulting uncertainty. In addition, uncertainty from the missing 3,000 mt of bigeye tuna in Korea’s longline catch data emphasised the value of accelerating e-reporting adoption and e-monitoring evaluation in the Commission."
WCPFC13,353,"Dr Graham Pilling noted that including uncertainty in the bigeye tuna longline catch within the 2017 stock assessment was possible to do, but that SPC would appreciate some guidance on how to frame those scenarios for that assessment."
WCPFC13,354,"In reference to CMM 2015-01 paragraph 61, the Commission noted that the SPC evaluation (WCPFC13-2016-15) had reviewed CMM 2015-01. Para. 18"
WCPFC13,355,"Para. 18 of CMM 2015-01 the provision (paragraph 18) prevents CCMs other than Kiribati from fishing on FADs in the high seas in 2017. Para. 18’s footnote 5 allows other fleets to join Kiribati in being permitted to fish on FADs in the high seas during 2017 based on them achieving a certain WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 51 of 361reduction over past years. The footnote reads in part: “The high seas FAD closure in paragraph 18 does not apply in 2017 to a CCM that has achieved a verifiable reduction in bigeye catches by its purse seine vessels to 55% from current levels (2010-2012), to be reviewed on the basis of the advice of the Scientific Committee.” As SC12 and TCC12 had discussed at length, the existing footnote was not clearly worded and EU had undertaken to clarify that the obligation extended to 2017 as well. EU proposed an amendment to the footnote for the Commission’s consideration (WCPFC13-2016-DP01)."
WCPFC13,356,"FFA members supported the amendment of footnote 5 to require CCMs intending to use the exemption from the high seas FAD closure in 2017 to maintain a ‘verifiable reduction’ in bigeye catches below the 55% catch level of the reference period 2010-2012. These CCMs considered that discussion about how the reduction is ‘verified’ would be useful, and how to ensure appropriate and independent monitoring mechanisms were in place. FFA members noted that in the longer term the Commission needed advice from SC for any new measure given that catch and effort of most DWFN fleets is in decline in the purse-seine fishery."
WCPFC13,357,"The Chair noted the request for clarification about how the verifiable reduction would be monitored for those who claim the exemption, noting that TCC had recommended that the provisions of footnote 5 applies for eight purse-seine fleets – Ecuador, El Salvador, EU, RMI, New Zealand, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu – in 2017."
WCPFC13,358,"SC12 noted that the present CMM is unclear about how footnote 5 should be applied so Korea agreed with EU that the 55% reduction should be retained in 2017, and agreed a verification system was needed. Korea considered that the footnote was only applicable in 2017."
WCPFC13,359,"USA noted the current footnote called for SC to provide advice but SC has not been able to do that, so from USA’s point of view the prerequisites for using the footnote had not been fulfilled. In addition, USA noted ambiguities in the footnote. The EU amendment would fix one of the ambiguities by requiring – for any CCM that achieves the reduction and opts not to prohibit FAD setting on the high seas in 2017 – that the reduction be maintained in 2017, which USA considered appropriate, but USA thought it would be useful to clarify whether the reduction is “of 55%” or “to 55%”. USA considered it should be “of 55%”. This CCM agreed there was an issue of the reductions being verifiable, especially as some of the figures have been updated since TCC."
WCPFC13,360,The Chair noted the widespread agreement to the EU proposal to amend the footnote. The Chair asked CCMs if they agreed that CCMs besides EU are able to come under the footnote. The Chair noted that a way to verify and monitor was required whether one or a number of CCMs claimed the exemption – the Commission had to find a way to ensure that a CCM applying the footnote adheres to the limits. Another issue to discuss was how to interpret the footnote – a strict reading suggests a decision on who should apply it should be advised by SC.
WCPFC13,361,"Chinese Taipei and Japan considered the questions were linked – the decisions of which CCMs could claim the exemption could not be made independently because it may depend on what the monitoring system was. And as SC12 was not able to give guidance, CCMs did not know how to verify it and make a decision."
WCPFC13,362,"EU clarified that it was suggesting an extension, noting that the footnote already applies for 2017. The main concern was how to verify, in 2017, that a CCM had the level of reduction. EU suggested it was possible for a fleet to estimate whether or not it was going to respect the condition or not but it could only be verified at the end of the year.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 52 of 361"
WCPFC13,363,"China noted that Attachment D of CMM 2015-01 indicated high seas purse-seine effort. Aside from the EU, the other CCMs listed had no high seas fishing days."
WCPFC13,364,Japan recognised that the EU reduction well exceeded 55% so it had a chance of achieving the exemption; the question was the other fleets which had not yet applied the exemption. This CCM considered they should have a plan to achieve the reduction and asked for explanation on the plan.  Japan requested clarification from SPC about whether 45% or 55% was the correct figure; was it a 55% reduction from the current level. The correct figure would enable the Commission to understand if a CCM had sufficiently reduced to be able to claim the exemption.
WCPFC13,365,"Based on the language of the CMM, SPC replied that it would be “to 55%” from current levels, noting that a reduction “to 45%” was a reduction “of 55%”."
WCPFC13,366,"USA agreed with Japan and EU’s recollection regarding the intention of the footnote – which was a reduction “by 55%”. This CCM confirmed that the list compiled by TCC12 was based on CCM reporting data, not verified data. In addition, the footnote contained no dates for when the reductions were to occur. USA commented that based on the footnote CCMs that reduced “by 55%” in 2016 should be able to take advantage of the exemption in 2017, and if that is the decision, the Commission needs to devise a way for that mechanism to work."
WCPFC13,367,"The Chair noted that the Commission had more work to do on the interpretation of the footnote, and SPC would investigate the data. A small group discussed the issue in the margins then came back to plenary with a recommended paragraph. It included a date (2015) in which the reduction was to have taken place and the verifiable reduction of purse seine catches would be 45% from 2010-2012 levels."
WCPFC13,368,"USA was concerned about the addition of the date (“2015”) to the informal small working group text – noting it was a limitation that was not included in the original footnote. Removing the date would treat all CCMs in the same way, which USA preferred rather than different fleets being treated in different ways. USA stressed that in the bridging tropical tuna measure and other future measures the Commission should limit or eliminate exemptions."
WCPFC13,369,A lengthy discussion took place about the history of the footnote. The small group had proposed reduced by 45% to a level of 55% and CCMs had divergent views about this.
WCPFC13,370,"Japan noted the lack of official record on this point and offered its own remembrance which was that Japan had proposed to reduce by 60%, EU could not accept 60% but could accept 50%, FFA proposed 55% and that is what the Commission settled on. Consequently Japan believed the reduction to be 55% not 45%. Japan expressed surprise that PNA CCMs had supported a 45% reduction. EU agreed with this interpretation."
WCPFC13,371,"The PNA Office noted that a range of views were expressed according to its records of the discussion, and commented that the rationale for the figure at the time was that other fleets would be observing a fourth month and maybe a fifth month high seas FAD closure, which was equivalent to a 45% reduction. A reduction by 45% reducing to 55% was therefore proposed and it had been taken up."
WCPFC13,372,"Considering debating recollections to be unconstructive, the Chair noted that SPC had advised that the difference between the two interpretations is that one of the members which thought it had qualified for the exemption would not. The Chair noted that the original footnote envisioned a role for SC – SC should have considered who could apply this particular provision. The footnote related to one of the WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 53 of 361Commission’s most important measures, whose paragraph 18 was scheduled to come into effect in 2017."
WCPFC13,373,"EU recognised that its addition to the footnote (“in 2015”) had provoked unproductive discussions and considered that the footnote was clear, requiring a verifiable reduction and SC to review the process. EU recalled an agreement to a 55% reduction, but recognised that the rationale had not been discussed in plenary. Consequently, staying with what was written into the footnote was the best way forward. Regardless of the level of the reduction chosen, EU qualified for the exemption."
WCPFC13,374,Tuvalu considered that the official record of the discussion was the footnote itself as adopted by the Commission.
WCPFC13,375,The Chair noted that if the Commission was not able to adopt the reduction by 45% to 55% proposed by the Chair the Commission would need to revert to the original language then agree to which CCMs the exemption applied.
WCPFC13,376,"RMI advised that it would be applying the footnote, and was confident it would get through the assessment."
WCPFC13,377,"USA proposed eliminating the 2015 date but retaining the SC review. This CCM suggested that when SC reviews the 2016 data, it could complete the process. USA acknowledged that there could be no decision on 2016 data until SPC did its work in 2017, but noted with concern there would be a period of fishing in the meantime."
WCPFC13,378,"EU considered that the reverse would also apply: those fleets that did not respect the reduction should stop fishing, which would reopen the whole matter. This CCM considered that the footnote was clear and the only choice was to look at 2015 data."
WCPFC13,379,Japan could go along with either level of reduction if the exemption was not applied before the SC review of the data in August 2017.
WCPFC13,380,"The Chair noted SPC’s clarification that it could consider 2016 data in early 2017, so SC13 would have the data to make the determination."
WCPFC13,381,"Pointing out that subsidiary bodies make recommendations not decisions, China had difficulties with the reference year. If SC did the review of which CCMs qualified based on 2016, the decision on that would not be made until the Commission met at the end of the year. In the meantime, FAD use on the high seas could continue."
WCPFC13,382,"Without agreement on new language that the Chair had provided in WCPFC13-2016-38, the Commission accepted WCPFC13-2016-DP01, which maintained the existing language and added some clarifying language. It was suggested that the footnote not be assessed for compliance purposes and the future tropical tuna measure would take up the issues raised by the ambiguities in the original footnote."
WCPFC13,383,"Japan noted that this was a one-year measure and acknowledged the Chair’s reassurances. Noting that the Commission was fully reviewing the tropical tuna measure, including this provision, and would try to avoid ambiguity, Japan did not at this stage insist on a reduction of 55%."
WCPFC13,384,"In response to a query from USA about the suggested new element of not being subject to a compliance review, the Chair suggested that TCC would only have the same difficulties in determining WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 54 of 361what the requirement was and who could apply the exemption. The Chair took the view that the Commission should not push the currently irresolvable discussion to TCC."
WCPFC13,385,"Although there might be differences in interpretation, EU thought it would be useful if the information was presented to TCC. TCC could decide not to assess a compliance status, but for the sake of transparency TCC should have the data presented to it."
WCPFC13,386,"The Chair suggested that information could be provided to TCC outside the CMS process. However, the issue was left to those setting the TCC agenda to decide the best approach. No decision was reached on the compliance aspect."
WCPFC13,387,"Without agreement on new language that the Chair had provided in WCPFC13-2016-38, the Commission accepted WCPFC13-2016-DP01, which maintained the existing language and added some clarifying language. The Commission agreed that footnote 5 of Paragraph 18 of CMM 2016-01 is replaced by the following text:  “The high seas FAD closure in paragraph 18 does not apply in 2017 to a CCM that has achieved a verifiable reduction in bigeye catches by its purse seine vessels to 55% from current levels (2010-2012), to be reviewed on the basis of the advice of the Scientific Committee. The measures that the Philippines will take are in Attachment C. A CCM that has qualified for the above mentioned exemption shall maintain a verifiable reduction in bigeye catches by its purse seine vessels to 55% from the reference levels (2010-2012) also in the course of 2017.” Paras. 25 and 26"
WCPFC13,388,"Paragraphs 25 and 26 of CMM 2015-01 relate to high seas purse-seine effort limits, which under the measure are required to be reviewed in 2016 and a decision taken on the limits to apply after 2016."
WCPFC13,389,"American Samoa noted it is a developing Participating Territory which faces unique economic issues and has its own fisheries aspirations. It has a small and vulnerable economy that is highly dependent on tuna fisheries. American Samoa’s tuna canneries support thousands of direct and indirect jobs and longline and purse-seine fisheries that supply its canneries. American Samoa’s purse seiners have their own MSC certification and the canneries are dependent on them for supply of raw material. This purse-seine fishery is integral to American Samoa’s economy and should be recognized accordingly. The high seas have long been the most important and traditional fishing grounds for American Samoa’s purse seine fisheries. As such, this CCM emphasised that appropriately managed access must be maintained."
WCPFC13,390,The Chair enquired whether CCMs wanted to roll the paragraphs over for application in 2017 or make changes.
WCPFC13,391,"USA needed more time to consider the proposal, noting that American Samoa had highlighted the importance of the high seas for its economy."
WCPFC13,392,"When plenary came back to the issue, USA made the point that circumstances had changed significantly since paragraphs 25 and 26 of CMM 2015-01 were adopted and USA agreed to a significant reduction in high seas effort by its purse-seine fleet. The limit was well below its fleet’s history and needs and had a negative impact on the American Samoa economy whose coastal processing industry relies on the USA fleet accessing fisheries in close proximity, includes the high seas. USA stated that these constraints on coastal processing impacted canneries and support industries, and the provision of territory government services. USA noted Resolution 2008-01 and WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 55 of 361paragraph 14 of CMM 2013-07 – “CCMs shall ensure, consistent with national laws and regulations, that actions are not taken to constrain coastal processing and use of transhipment facilities and associated vessels of SIDS and territories, or undermine legitimate investment in SIDS and territories in the Convention Area.” USA noted SIDS fleets including charter vessels have no high seas limits and requested the deletion of paragraph 26 and revision of Attachment D to address the significant constraints on American Samoa."
WCPFC13,393,EU considered this proposal was outside the deadlines.
WCPFC13,394,"The Chair confirmed that proposals should be provided 30 days in advance of the Commission meeting was not a rule but a practice to which the Commission has aimed to adhere. However, proposals arise on the floor occasionally and the Chair noted that the Commission has discussed them to the extent agreement can be reached."
WCPFC13,395,"PNA members considered the high seas purse-seine effort limits to be a critical aspect of CMM 2015-01 for the management of bigeye and skipjack and did not support any changes to the limits in Attachment D, particularly increasing the limits."
WCPFC13,396,"RMI associated itself with PNA members’ comments. While the USA proposal referenced Resolution 2008-01, it did not apply the provisions of CMM 2013-06 which, henceforth, would be considered a critical measure to apply for all proposals submitted."
WCPFC13,397,"China also made a proposal across the floor on another paragraph in the measure relating to amending Attachment F, to change the catch limits for longliners in 2017."
WCPFC13,398,EU considered it very difficult to be able to assess the implications when receiving proposals so late in a meeting. The Commission did not have the benefit of SPC analysis to judge the extent of such proposals’ impact in terms of stocks.
WCPFC13,399,FSM supported EU’s views and there was no agreement on either USA or China’s proposals.
WCPFC13,400,"In reference to CMM 2015-01 paragraph 25 and 26, the Commission agreed that the provisions for 2016 would apply in 2017."
WCPFC13,401,"In reference to CMM 2015-01 paragraph 40, the Commission agreed that the limits in Attachment F for 2017 would apply in 2017. Paras. 28 and 43"
WCPFC13,402,"The Commission has agreed to review the issue of yellowfin tuna purse-seine catch and longline limits on recommendations from SC. SC had made no recommendations on this and the Chair suggested that if the Commission again chooses to not adopt yellowfin tuna limits in either the purse-seine or longline fishery, WCPFC13 should, by way of drafting some language for the report, ensure there is no misunderstanding in the revised measure to apply in 2017. It was further noted that the bridging tropical tuna measure could examine limits which might apply."
WCPFC13,403,EU commented that it would like catch limits to be applied for this species in the future.
WCPFC13,404,"In reference to CMM 2015-01 paragraph 28 and 43, the Commission agreed that no limits for yellowfin tuna would apply in 2017 for purse seine and longline fisheries. The Secretariat was tasked with including a clarifying note to this effect in the update of CMM 2015-01. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 56 of 361"
WCPFC13,405,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2016-01 Conservation and Management Measure for Bigeye, Yellowfin and Skipjack tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Attachment O), which will replace CMM 2015-01. 9.2.2 New proposals Japan – capacity management"
WCPFC13,406,"Japan introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP26, a proposal to manage capacity in the purse-seine fishing fleet, expressing the view that fishing grounds for bigeye tuna around Japan have disappeared and skipjack tuna has been reducing around Japan’s coasts, with small scale fishers who depend on those fisheries, and the economy and culture of small scale fishing villages, were suffering. In Japan’s view there were too many exemptions, and purse-seine capacity was increasing, while Japan has maintained its number of purse-seine vessels at 35 for years. Japan had submitted proposals on capacity for two years and this one, while slightly different, had the same purpose. It takes a step by step approach: first, freezing the total number of vessels larger than 24 metres with freezing capacity in the Convention area; second, reduce the number of vessels to December 2012 levels by the end of 2017; third, jointly develop a scheme to further reduce capacity to December 2012 levels; fourth, consideration of capacity transfer to SIDS, capacity scrapping, and capacity transfer to other oceans. Japan noted that in the short term it could be difficult for SIDS to develop their industries but in the medium to long term it could improve stock status bring benefit SIDS."
WCPFC13,407,"PNA members stated that capacity management provisions have been ineffective, have no conservation effect, and are designed to protect existing fleets from competition; they have also obstructed the domestic development of SIDS fleets and encouraged some Commission Members to misreport their fleet sizes which undermines the Commission fleet data. PNA shared FFA members’ view that the best way to manage capacity is as the VDS does, to set limits for catches and effort, and apply them in such a way that excess capacity is removed through market processes. Referencing WCPFC13-2016-DP28, PNA members noted that the effectiveness of the VDS is demonstrated by the stable purse seine fleet level, catch and effort in the tropical purse seine fishery since the purse seine fishery hard limits were established in 2012. PNA flagged that it will propose the deletion of the capacity paragraphs in the bridging tropical tuna measure."
WCPFC13,408,"Kiribati supported PNA’s position, noting difficulties with the capacity limits proposed by Japan. PNG commented that the proposal’s application of the SIDS CMM 2013-06 checklist was a little cursory."
WCPFC13,409,"Chinese Taipei noted that the Commission was discussing harvest strategies for rebuilding stocks, especially bigeye tuna, but controlling capacity was also important. This CCM noted that the proposal puts forward as a first step a freeze on capacity. Noting that the proposal allows for future transfers of capacity to SIDS, Chinese Taipei encouraged WCPFC13 to consider the proposal’s approach. It was noted that Chinese Taipei has maintained its fleet at 34 purse-seine vessels for years."
WCPFC13,410,"USA generally supported capacity limitation as a way to manage fleets, and commented that excess capacity can lead to, among other things, IUU fishing. With WCPFC not having capacity limits, the area is an easy place for excess capacity to be introduced. USA noted that effectively managing capacity required a better understanding of current capacity levels, but consensus had not been reached to do so. USA noted that the proposal would change the baseline, but stated its preference to not change the baseline; it should remain at 2012 as it is in the current measure. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 57 of 361"
WCPFC13,411,"EU noted that managing capacity was a priority for it in all the RFMOs to which it is a member and considered that doing so should be an objective of WCPFC. EU conceded it was not easy to strike a balance in WCPFC – over-capacity creates pressure on fish stocks, but at the same time aspirations for SIDS development had to be respected. While WCPFC had controls on effort, TACs and limits, EU considered that additional measures were needed to manage fleet capacity."
WCPFC13,412,"Japan stated that capacity management is effective as a measure against IUU fishing. Japan noted that it was in communication with the Scientific Services Provider about the applicable figure to freeze capacity to, though this wasn’t yet resolved, and whether it would apply to ‘active capacity’ or vessels ‘authorised to fish’ (paragraph 1 of the proposal) could be further discussed."
WCPFC13,413,"PNG supported Solomon Islands’ statement, noting that very effective zone-based capacity management in place in the WCPFC."
WCPFC13,414,WTPO commented that the capacity issue was very important to WTPO boat owners. This observer expressed the view that high risk factors should be eliminated and there should be a freeze on capacity without any exemptions. WTPO noted the need to develop ways to transfer non-SIDS capacity to the SIDS fleet.
WCPFC13,415,"While there was no consensus on the proposal, the Chair noted that future discussions would pick the issues up."
WCPFC13,416,"After discussions with several members and continuing differences of opinion, Japan acknowledged the lack of agreement on its proposal and made a statement on capacity management:  “It is very regrettable that WCPFC13 did not agree on management of purse seine fishing capacity proposed by Japan. We believe that the primary cause of the bigeye tuna stock decline is the increase of purse seine fishing capacity both in the number of vessels and capacity per one vessel. We also cannot ignore the possibility of negative effects by effort creep. Three years ago, at WCPFC 10, the Commission has agreed to develop a joint reduction plan for purse seine fishing capacity. Based on this agreement, Japan has been submitting a concrete proposal every year but has not got sufficient support again this year. Japan has been implementing all the tropical tuna measures faithfully. Its longline catch of bigeye tuna had decreased from 29,248 mt in 2004 to 17,825 mt in 2015, a reduction of 39%. The number of FAD sets was reduced from 3,162 in 2004 to 665 in 2015, a reduction of 79%. In the meantime, the total number of FADs used in the entire WCPO increased from 10,768 in 2010 to 13,932 in 2015, an increase of 29 %. Hence the current CMM has not achieved the objective of fishing mortality reduction, and the bigeye stock has not recovered as expected. As a result, many Japanese coastal fishing communities have experienced serious adverse impacts on their livelihoods, and coastal fishing grounds for bigeye have almost disappeared and catch of bigeye has declined drastically. As for skipjack, their migration to Japanese coastal waters has continued to stay in a very low level recently. In particular, migration to the western part of Japan has almost disappeared. This phenomenon negatively affects not only catches of coastal small-scale fishermen, but also cultural activities in such a way that traditional festivals to celebrate seasonal catches of skipjack are frequently cancelled. According to paragraph 7 of CMM 2015-06 for skipjack, the Commission shall consider and pay particular attention to any future recommendations of the Scientific Committee regarding potential spatial impacts of fishing on the skipjack stock, including possible local depletion or range contraction. Japan believes that there is a strong relationship between poor catches of skipjack in coastal areas and overcapacity of purse seine fishing vessels in the tropical areas. We hope that more evidence will be provided to the Scientific Committee to demonstrate this. In order for all members concerned including Japan to receive sufficient conservation benefit from tropical tunas as well as sustain small-scale WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 58 of 361fishermen in coastal areas, Japan believes that reduction of fishing mortality as well as efforts by purse seiners is essential. Japan will continue to work with other CCMs toward this goal.” 9.3 Review of CMM 2015-02 (South Pacific albacore) 9.3.1 New proposals"
WCPFC13,417,"CCMs wanting to raise issues relating to CMM 2015-02 or with any proposals to refine and amend CMM 2015-02 were asked to raise them under this agenda item. The Chair noted that SC12 did not provide any additional management advice, maintaining SC11’s advice (WCPFC13-2016-17).  FFA proposal to establish a limit for South Pacific Albacore"
WCPFC13,418,"FFA introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP13, a proposal to establish a limit for South Pacific albacore. These CCMs thanked the Chair for including South Pacific albacore in the consultative draft of the bridging tropical tuna CMM, however they consider it a better approach for the tropical tuna CMM focused on bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna. FFA members proposed a parallel process for the consultative development of a South Pacific albacore bridging CMM to replace the current measure, to be developed over the course of 2017 for potential adoption at WCPFC14. It is intended to be a transitional measure to keep the fishery stable during the shift from the current piecemeal approach to the Harvest Strategy approach. South Pacific albacore management reform is among FFA members’ highest priorities. They flagged continuing to develop harmonised EEZ area-based management mechanisms and look to the Commission to ensure that fishing on the high seas does not undermine their in-zone measures. FFA’s consultative draft proposed a framework for supporting progressively improved management of the South Pacific albacore stock and provides a starting point for implementing harvest control rules as they are agreed. The bridging measure will progressively incorporate elements on the harvest strategy approach as they are agreed, but will initially be based on a limit on the catch of albacore in the Convention area south of the equator. The bridging measure would establish proportional EEZ and high seas shares in the fishery and members will cooperatively manage fisheries in each respective zone and on the high seas. The bridging measure would establish an interim total catch limit until the TRP is adopted, to provide a starting point to work towards the new limit (from the TRP) using HCRs when adopted. FFA members looked forward to discuss the bridging measure in the margins, with the aim of returning to plenary a text that broadly describes the elements that will need to be discussed over the course of 2017."
WCPFC13,419,"In response to two questions from China, New Zealand clarified that the proposal represented a potential successor to the current measure, and sought to incorporate the current measure. SPC confirmed that it assesses the South Pacific albacore stock as one stock, regardless of whether it is caught inside or outside EEZs."
WCPFC13,420,"American Samoa noted that its longline fishery is almost entirely dependent on the South Pacific albacore stock. It was a fishery that had gone through great changes in the last decade. In the early to mid-2000s, the fishery was profitable. In 2014, the economics of the fishery became so bad that it was better to tie up vessels than go fishing. Over the same time period American Samoa lost its small scale artisanal longline fleet due to the poor returns from longline fishing. American Samoa was interested in measures that result in increased albacore catch rates and improved economic conditions for its domestic fleets, and a return to levels previously experienced. American Samoa continues to aspire to develop its domestic fleets, in a sustainable and responsible manner. American Samoa recognised the rate at which economic circumstances can outpace management initiatives. In this regard, American Samoa supported an interim TRP that ultimately achieves increased catch rates. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 59 of 361"
WCPFC13,421,"USA noted the importance of this stock, the need for a new CMM to manage it and the use of HCRs in the New Zealand proposal. USA supported American Samoa’s comments and suggested the measure should limit itself to longline fleets, as other fleets have a negligible impact on the stock."
WCPFC13,422,The Chair asked that interested delegations provide drafting suggestions to New Zealand through the week to assist its coordination of a bridging measure on South Pacific albacore. A working group was not established.
WCPFC13,423,"On 9 December New Zealand reported that consultations had not produced enough substantive comment to produce a revised draft, but the discussions had been encouraging. FFA members wanted to see a draft developed alongside the bridging tropical tuna measure through 2017, and one CCM confirmed it was willing to work intersessionally to advance such a proposal."
WCPFC13,424,"Environmental Defense Fund made a statement on South Pacific albacore on behalf of Environmental Defense Fund, Greenpeace, SFP, Pew Charitable Trusts, and WWF, noting that their comments were also relevant to agenda item 8.4 (South Pacific albacore TRP). These observers hoped the Commission would be able to make more progress on issues related to South Pacific albacore during this meeting. For a variety of reasons, the South Pacific albacore measure has not been able to control or limit the effects of increased fishing capacity on this stock. American Samoa has said they have had to tie up vessels due to economic conditions in the fishery; a number of countries are in a similar position. These problems will only worsen unless we are able to collectively agree to manage this stock throughout its range. This should be a top priority for the next Commission meeting. While the South Pacific albacore fishery is not overfished, SPC has said if we continue to maintain the status quo the stock will be at risk. The fishery is not economically sustainable and fishery participants are being lost. These observers supported an intersessional consultative process that includes discussions to both develop a revised South Pacific albacore measure as well as a TRP and urged CCMs to work together and progress these issues for action at the next Commission meeting."
WCPFC13,425,"WCPFC13 agreed to task New Zealand, on behalf of FFA, with advising members early in 2017 of the proposed process for progressing the Bridging CMM on South Pacific albacore. 9.4 Review of CMM 2005-03 (North Pacific albacore)"
WCPFC13,426,"Shuya Nakatsuka, Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group, noted that no assessment on North Pacific albacore was conducted in 2016 so with no new information, current management advice from ISC, reviewed at SC12, was maintained. The Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group referred delegates to WCPFC13-2016-18, a reference paper for the review of CMM 2005-03 (North Pacific albacore) for further information. It was noted that an assessment is planned for 2017."
WCPFC13,427,"Later in the meeting, the NC Chair, Masanori Miyahara reported on North Pacific albacore. No substantial discussion had taken place at NC12. The Scientific Services Provider, ISC, was recognised for its ongoing work developing MSE for the stock. Next year the third MSE workshop will be held. Also in 2017, a new stock assessment for North Pacific albacore will be undertaken, and the CMM for North Pacific albacore will be reviewed in accordance with the results of the stock assessment."
WCPFC13,428,"Canada noted that the NP Albacore MSE process was making progress, and had reached agreement on six interim management objectives this year. Canada will host the 3rd MSE workshop in Vancouver in 2017, with the goal to reach agreement on acceptable levels of risk and candidate HCRs. Once these inputs are finalised, the operating model will be developed and simulations will begin to evaluate the WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 60 of 361possible management strategies. This CCM looked forward to ongoing progress of this work, and stressed the importance of MSE as a component of harvest strategies for WCPFC stocks and fisheries."
WCPFC13,429,"One CCM asked what use is made of the six-monthly reporting of North Pacific albacore catch data required under paragraph 3 of CMM 2005-03, noting that a number of CCMs had been assessed as non-compliant for submitting the report after the deadline."
WCPFC13,430,"The Executive Director noted that the data are collected by the Commission Secretariat and made available to the NC and ISC for monitoring catch levels for the North Pacific albacore stock and for stock assessment purposes. This reporting is a specific requirement under the said CMM, though it was noted that there is more value in the data provided annually. 9.5 Review of CMM 2015-04 (Pacific bluefin tuna) 2016 Pacific bluefin tuna stock assessment"
WCPFC13,431,The reference paper for WCPFC13’s review of CMM 2015-04 (Pacific bluefin tuna) was WCPFC13-2016-19.
WCPFC13,432,"Shuya Nakatsuka, Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group, presented the 2016 Pacific Bluefin tuna stock assessment. Three meetings were held – in April and November 2015 and February/March 2016 – and included scientists from USA, Mexico, Korea, Chinese Taipei, Japan and IATTC. The assessment was completed over two weeks in March. The stock assessment was reviewed by the ISC plenary and SC12. The data used for the assessment was up to June 2015, at which time the stricter CMM had only been in place since January 2015. The assessment also used size information from various fisheries and CPUE indexes for the Chinese Taipei and Japanese longline fisheries for adults, and a juvenile index from Japanese troll fisheries; there were good data fits to the model and the assessment has improved. The current status is 2.6% of SSBF=0 – much lower than LRP of tropical tunas but the Pacific bluefin tuna stock has been below that level for most of the assessment period. The rebuilding target is currently around 7% of SSBF=0. Recruitment has fluctuated without indicating a trend, and fishing mortality has decreased slightly in recent years. The effect of the new measure is not incorporated; it is hoped that the new measure will reduce fishing mortality further. Overfishing is occurring and the stock is overfished. If Fmed is considered to be the threshold, the current F is at the threshold level. Future projections used 11 harvesting scenarios and three recruitment scenarios. Under all examined scenarios, the initial WCPFC rebuilding target would be achieved, and the probability of achieving the initial WCPFC rebuilding target would increase if more conservative measures were implemented. A reduction in catch limit for small fish would have a larger effect on recovery than a reduction for large fish. The stock assessment model was updated for the 2016 benchmark assessment, and the base-case model is substantially improved from the previous assessment. The results were similar to the previous assessment – the stock is still at a near-historic low level and current fishing mortality is above all reference points except Floss and Fmed. The initial rebuilding target of WCPFC would be achieved by higher probability than the level prescribed in the WCPFC CMM and the probability will improve with additional measures the next major assessment will be conducted in 2020 but an update will be undertaken in 2018, and in the years between ISC will monitor the indices. The stock assessment will be presented to a Pacific bluefin tuna stakeholder meeting in April/May 2017."
WCPFC13,433,"EU expressed extreme disappointment with the lack of progress and postponements of urgent decisions, and considered the minor progress as totally insufficient given the gravity of the situation. This CCM recalled the drastic measures ICCAT adopted, which have shown good results – and Atlantic bluefin tuna was depleted to 7% when it decided to act, not 2.6% like the Pacific bluefin tuna. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 61 of 361This CCM commented that the current depletion level and the expected interim rebuilding plan depletion level were 2.6% and 6.7% – well below the 20%, LRP for tropical tunas – and short of that needed to correct the status of the stock. EU considered that even a 6.7% depletion ratio estimated for 2024 represents a management failure for the Commission. EU expressed the view that WCPFC and IATTC are responsible for jointly taking more significant measures. The IATTC performance review contained a recommendation supported by EU for both Commissions to jointly develop a formal arrangement for shared management for recovery of Pacific bluefin tuna. EU made a number of comments about the role of ISC, and considered that responsibility for the Pacific bluefin tuna stock lies with WCPFC not ISC and scientific assessments should be the purview of WCPFC and IATTC, not the ISC. This CCM noted that the SC12 recommendation (paragraph 71) to take “urgent coordinated actions between WCPFC and IATTC in reviewing the current rebuilding plan, establishing the emergency rule as well as considering and developing reference points and HCRs for the long term management of Pacific bluefin tuna” has not been complied with. EU did not question the robustness of the ISC assessment, but preferred a different process, noting that the management advice from ISC was different from that of IATTC based on the same stock assessment. IATTC recommended that WCPFC adopt additional measure to reduce the catch of adults, which was not reflected in the ISC advice."
WCPFC13,434,"The Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group took up the scientific points in EU’s intervention, stressing that the organisational structure does not undermine the scientific results. It was noted that a 20% depletion level or LRP is not universal; among tuna RFMOs different levels are used. It was noted that a main concern would be continuous recruitment failure. While current stock status is low for Pacific bluefin tuna, the recruitment is not failing, according to new information. The Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group further noted that if the Commission wished, it could agree a higher target and a shorter rebuilding period, but commented that the current assessment is that the interim target will be achieved under current management measures."
WCPFC13,435,New Zealand and Australia expressed concern about the status of and management arrangements for Pacific bluefin tuna.
WCPFC13,436,"In response to a query about the recruitment estimate and how it would affect the timeframe to get to the rebuilding target, the Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group explained that the current target is based on the recruitment level of the historical average, with the assessment currently prescribing a timeframe of 2024. The steepness review would take place as one aspect of the next major assessment, in 2020. ISC’s conclusion is that the current base case represents a basis for assessment.  Pacific bluefin tuna – NC12"
WCPFC13,437,"Later in the meeting, the NC Chair, Masanori Miyahara, reported that there had been good progress this year including a joint meeting with IATTC to discuss the overall framework for Pacific bluefin tuna management. The joint working group meeting included NC members, some IATTC members (EU and Mexico) and scientific staff and observers, and discussed the rebuilding strategy, precautionary management framework, catch documentation scheme and the emergency rule and reviewed current management measures in IATTC and WCPFC. NC12 endorsed the conclusions of the joint working group and recommended a draft Pacific bluefin tuna measure, the main points were:  General Provision o Add the conclusions of the joint working group meeting on rebuilding strategy  Participants supported the following as part of an ocean-wide rebuilding strategy for Pacific bluefin tuna: “Recognizing that the management objectives of WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 62 of 361WCPFC and IATTC are to maintain or restore fish stocks at levels capable of producing MSY, to rebuild the Pacific bluefin tuna stock by adopting and achieving step-wise rebuilding targets”  To help formulate the Pacific bluefin tuna rebuilding strategy, participants supported a request to the ISC to evaluate the performance of various harvest scenarios  Participants supported a plan for the WCPFC and IATTC to agree in 2017 on a second rebuilding target, to be reached in 2030, and to revisit their management measures as needed  Participants supported the ISC’s intent to hold a Pacific bluefin tuna stakeholders’ meeting (April/May 2017). o Increased frequency of review from three years to two years  Management of large fish o Revise to the same language of management of small fish, and  o add special rules on usage of the catch limit for small fish to catch large fish.  Management of Farming (new) o Take measures necessary to strengthen monitoring and data collecting system for Pacific bluefin tuna farming."
WCPFC13,438,"In response to a request from New Zealand for elaboration on the emergency rule discussions, the NC Chair noted that Japan had proposed an emergency rule at such time as the recruitment level is unusually low. Japan proposed a 50% reduction in catch as emergency actions to be taken in its proposal. However, agreement could not be reached – some parties thought it was too generous, and some thought it was too strict. The discussion was deferred to next year."
WCPFC13,439,"In response to a query from Indonesia about ‘large fish’ and ‘small fish’, the NC Chair explained that for small fish the catch allowance was cut by half; decided in 2014 and implemented from 2015. For large fish – over 30kg – efforts were made to maintain the catch at the 2002-2004 level; this provision is clarified to be mandatory this year. Restricting small fish catch will have a significant impact on recovery. The NC Chair commented that the stock started to recover even before the current measure started, and if small fish catch is reduced further, that reduction would contribute to the recovery of large fish numbers. It was noted that Korea was willing to make a voluntary payback from next year, as its fishers unexpectedly caught a significant amount of large fish this year."
WCPFC13,440,"EU noted that it participated in the joint meeting as an IATTC member, and in NC as an observer. This CCM expressed frustration, stating that NC appears to consistently postpone progress. Stating that the first rebuilding plan target has fallen short of what is needed to recover the stock and should be reviewed, this CCM recalled that bigeye tuna stock was considered a concern at 16% of depletion ration, but Pacific bluefin tuna is now 2.6%. SC considered that urgent action was needed in reviewing the current rebuilding plan, establishing the emergency rule and developing reference points for Pacific bluefin tuna, but these things were not done. In EU’s point of view the emergency rule proposed by Japan was not scientifically-based, and for that reason the EU did not support the proposal; it was not the appropriate action that was needed to address the situation. EU recognised that discussions on these issues are difficult, but stated that NC had failed for some years to adopt measures to better manage Pacific bluefin tuna."
WCPFC13,441,"FFA members expressed great concern that the 2016 stock assessment for Pacific bluefin tuna confirmed a continued decline, with the spawning stock biomass now at 2.6% of unfished levels, which in their view was nothing short of a management failure. These CCMs stated that NC had failed to develop meaningful management recommendations and, as a Commission, CCMs have failed to hold NC to the same standards adopted for the other stocks. For any stock that is so depleted, targeted WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 63 of 361commercial fishing must cease. These CCMs recalled that the current Pacific bluefin measure includes a requirement to develop emergency rules in the event of a recruitment failure, which NC has failed to do so. The forward projections NC appears to have relied upon do not include any scenarios where recruitment continues at current historically low levels or declines. The most pessimistic recruitment scenario presented assumes that recruitment will be higher than the most recent level assessed, which these CCMs did not consider plausible. These CCMs called on the Commission to act decisively, and propose that the Commission implement emergency rules at this session and close the fishery to all targeted commercial fishing."
WCPFC13,442,"USA shared concerns that the NC has not gone far or fast enough in taking steps to conserve Pacific bluefin. USA has engaged through NC to push for robust science-based management measures and rebuilding plans and will continue to do so, with support in that effort of other Commission members. USA was very unhappy about the level of ambition reflected in the Pacific bluefin tuna measure NC has recommended the Commission adopt, but it believed that blocking NC’s recommendation will undermine efforts to rebuild the Pacific bluefin stock. The U.S. has offered proposals in recent years to rebuild the stock and establish a precautionary harvest strategy to maintain the population at MSY levels. Specifically, the U.S has proposed a rebuilding target of 20%SSBcurrentF=0, to be reached by 2030 and a LRP for the stock size of 15%SSBcurrentF=0 over the long term. Working in the NC with those members with fisheries targeting this stock, USA has not been fully satisfied but has agreed to a series of incremental measures towards a robust rebuilding framework. NC has recommended making some changes to the measure including to clarify that the large fish catch limit is binding on CCMs and to commit to adopting a second higher rebuilding target in 2017. USA recognized the implementation of the NC recommendation to allow transfer between large and small fish will require careful oversight and would hold members to strict compliance. With the choice between no progress and small but important forward progress, this was consistent with the Chair’s request during the opening ceremony to make progress wherever possible, even if it falls short of our full need. USA noted that not every step is a positive step. USA was one of the delegations that objected to adoption of the proposed emergency rule proposed by New Zealand because it was of the view that it would put in place a provision that was not robust enough to warrant adoption. USA was encouraged by the Joint IATTC-WCPFC NC working group meeting on the management of Pacific bluefin tuna, the first meeting of its type, which lay the ground work for a mutual plan for rebuilding and the long-term conservation and management of this stock throughout its range. The working group discussed six key management topics and agreed to request that the ISC assess 10 scenarios with a variety of restrictions on fishing mortality in both the WCPO and EPO, under low and average recruitment assumptions – a significant step in analyzing how to best manage those fisheries having the highest impact on the stock. The group’s other recommendations are being acted on by both NC and IATTC, some of which are reflected in the amendments to the measure under consideration. USA looked forward to continuing work in this joint working group to advance proposals in 2017 that ensure both commissions achieve their mandates to rebuild and maintain this species at sustainable levels."
WCPFC13,443,"Australia shared other CCMs’ concerns about the status of Pacific bluefin tuna, noting that the Commission runs a risk that its integrity and standing in the international community is compromised by continuing to fail to put effective management of the Pacific bluefin stock in place. The Commission has new scientific advice that confirms current management measures are failing to halt declines in the Pacific bluefin stock and that fishing mortality is too high. The Commission needs to continue work in this area as USA and New Zealand indicated, and needs to look to the NC to improve the trajectory of Pacific Bluefin tuna."
WCPFC13,444,"Japan recognised the concerns expressed by CCMs about the status of Pacific bluefin tuna. This CCM noted that NC members have been working to improve the stock situation for several years, but understands they should do more. Japan noted that the objective of the recovery plan was recovery to WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 64 of 361the historical median by 2024 with 60% probability. It should be recognised that the latest stock assessment results by ISC clearly indicated that this objective would be achieved. Japan explained that many kinds of fisheries exist in Japan – there were over 20,000 small scale troll fishers, 1,800 coastal trap fishers, plus purse-seine and longline fishers. In 2015 Japan held many stakeholder meetings across Japan explaining to fishers the need to reduce small fish catch in accordance with the decision by the Commission in 2014. Japan stated that it has been containing its catch in accordance with the agreement endorsed by the Commission two years ago, and it was difficult to ask fishers to make further reductions if they are on the right track, namely the objective agreed by the Commission would be achieved under the current measure. Japan noted that although the emergency rule was not adopted NC it would continue to discuss it with other Members. Japan further noted that a stock assessment update of indices will now be conducted every 2 years, which will allow for closer monitoring of the stock, reducing the need for emergency rules. In addition, Japan has a recruitment monitoring system, with information reported four times a year that will be incorporated into the stock assessment. Monitoring indicates that recruitment in 2015 was better than in 2014, and in 2016 the preliminary estimate is that recruitment was better than 2015, which also indicates less necessity of emergency rules. It was noted that unless the structure of Japan’s fisheries changes, they will not achieve 20% B0 because almost 97% of the Japanese catch is of juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna. For this reason, the NC-IATTC joint meeting asked ISC to conduct several scenarios, which will be discussed in the stakeholder meeting in 2017 along with the next rebuilding target. Responding to the concerns of members, Japan intended, on a voluntary basis, to consider taking advantage of the new rule converting catch limits for small fish to be used to catch large fish, noting that reducing the catch of juveniles will have a bigger impact than a reduction in larger fish catch. Japan also intended to make utmost efforts to not fully utilise its catch quota for small fish. If this proved successful it would make further contributions."
WCPFC13,445,"Korea also recognised the serious concerns expressed by many CCMs about the state of Pacific bluefin tuna and aligned itself with USA, considering that baby steps were better than no steps at all and could lead to a giant leap forward in the future. Korea noted the stakeholder meeting which NC planned to hold in 2017."
WCPFC13,446,"EU noted the importance of this issue to EU member states, and highlighted that measures had been taken in ICCAT. EU said that baby steps do not always lead to big steps; in this CCMs opinion, NC and the Commission have taken “crab steps”, going backwards or sideways instead of forward. This CCM was pleased that the discussions on Pacific bluefin tuna at WCPFC13 were fulsome, but picked up on Japan’s point that the “Commission endorsed” the measure in 2014, noting that the Commission has no real choice – it receives a recommendation from NC and can either reject or accept it. This CCM suggested that the Commission consider revising the way it works, and the relationship the Commission has with the NC. Noting that Pacific bluefin tuna management is the responsibility of the Commission, not the NC, this CCM considered that there was no real improvement and in comparison with what was done in ICCAT, this was a failure. Noting Japan’s concerns for its fishing communities, EU recalled the situation of fishers in the Mediterranean – these were small communities, extremely reliant on bluefin tuna, who made great sacrifices after the imposition of necessarily drastic measures to recover the Atlantic bluefin population. EU noted that Japan supported these measures in ICCAT, and had asked Mediterranean fishing communities to make sacrifices."
WCPFC13,447,"Chinese Taipei shared the concerns of other CCMs, noting that its fishing vessels target large bigeye tuna. This CCM noted the efforts which had been made but expressed the view that they were not enough. Chinese Taipei encouraged cooperation with IATTC and NC to adopt more ambitious measures to address the concerns of members. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 65 of 361"
WCPFC13,448,"Tonga thanked EU for its interventions on Pacific bluefin tuna and hoped EU would similarly lead discussions on tropical tuna, especially South Pacific albacore tuna which was of such concern to FFA members."
WCPFC13,449,"In response to EU’s intervention, Japan noted that while in the Atlantic Ocean the majority of catch is taken by purse-seiners, there are small operators and Japan supported exemptions to those small vessels in the Adriatic Sea and the Bay of Biscay; the fishing communities around Japan are like those in the Bay of Biscay. Japan said it would continue to try and come up with a better solution and would continue to communicate with its fishermen, whose representatives were also in attendance at WCPFC13."
WCPFC13,450,"The Pew Charitable Trusts noted that even though the assessment period does not capture the full history of the fishery, the population was above 20% of the historic population size for several years (1959-1962) during the period. Independent projections using the ISC models show there are several management options that would lead to a population of 20% of historic size by 2034 or earlier. For example, reducing catch limits by 30% from current levels would produce a 78% probability of reaching the target by 2034. A reduction of 40% would lead to an over 90% chance of reaching the level by 2029. Overall catch totals could remain the same and still have a nearly 100% chance of reaching the 20% target by 2029 if catch was restricted to fish 30kg or greater. This observer stated that current management measures for Pacific bluefin are not sufficient to reach the goals set by the Convention or the CMM, which sets an initial biomass rebuilding goal of 42,592 mt by 2024 with at least 60% probability. Projections by ISC show that current measures, if perfectly implemented, will only lead to a 56.1% chance of reaching 43,000 mt by 2024. This observer stated that WCPFC should immediately support a rebuilding target of at least 20% of unfished size, and propose management measures that would lead the bluefin tuna population to rebuild to that target by 2030."
WCPFC13,451,"WWF, Pew Charitable Trusts, Greenpeace and SFP expressed their continuing serious concern about the lack of progress towards long-term effective conservation measures for Pacific bluefin tuna and reiterated the urgency expressed by the EU on the stock status report. These observers noted that in September, NC took a positive step and agreed that the rebuilding plan for Pacific bluefin and long-term management framework should be harmonized across the Pacific and should be designed to return the population to a TRP that remains to be agreed. But very little progress was made at IATTC and NC. These observers believed that due to the lack of progress by the responsible bodies, the Pacific bluefin stock will continue to teeter on the edge of collapse. ISC confirmed that overfishing is continuing, and the stock remains heavily overfished, with a spawning stock biomass at 2.6% of its unfished level – clear indicators that the stock can no longer support industrial fisheries. These observers considered that the management measures taken across the Pacific have proven insufficient to conserve the biological integrity of this stock and the rebuilding scenarios are far too optimistic – both a higher target and shorter rebuilding time frame are needed. These observers expressed concerns about USA’s acceptance of incremental improvements, noting WCPFC must independently and immediately take action to address the conservation of this stock. If the WCPFC fails to do so, the NGO community would call for a complete moratorium on the commercial fishery catching this stock to ensure its recovery and rebuilding."
WCPFC13,452,"Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group stated that the ISC assessment results did confirm that the current measures will achieve the initial rebuilding target of WCPFC, which is calculated as the historical median of SSB under the new assessment."
WCPFC13,453,"FFA members noted that little evidence was presented by CCMs to support continuing Pacific bluefin tuna catch at current levels, just overly optimistic assumptions about recruitment increasing. Given the uncertainty around measuring recruitment, FFA members considered that catch reductions WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 66 of 361were necessary to safeguard against further declines in spawning stock and could be implemented in a similar form to that proposed by Japan in their draft emergency rule. It would require a percentage catch reduction of small and large fish; with such grave concerns for this stock, these CCMs considered small steps not sufficient."
WCPFC13,454,"Japan stressed that stock was not declining. This CCM noted that Vice-Chair of the ISC Pacific bluefin tuna working group indicated that based on the latest stock assessment, the spawning stock biomass started increasing in 2010 and was continuously increasing up to 2014, which was the latest year that the stock assessment could detect. The current measure started in 2015, with a 50% reduction in juvenile catches. Even before that, the stock was increasing for four consecutive years."
WCPFC13,455,Chair noted that this was a necessary discussion due to the condition of Pacific bluefin tuna and thanked CCMs for their strong contributions. WCPFC13’s task was to accept the NC recommendations or not accept them and to consider what the Commission wanted to ask the NC to do in its future meeting.
WCPFC13,456,EU noted how little room there is for the Commission to manoeuvre. The Commission has had to endorse measures that not all CCMs were happy with. This CCM suggested the Commission needed more time to consult with others before accepting the recommendations.
WCPFC13,457,"FSM noted that it was the Commission’s role to provide guidance when it felt a subsidiary body’s recommendations were not satisfactory. FSM suggested the NC convene a meeting in the margins of WCPFC13, as has taken place in the past, to discuss more meaningful reductions."
WCPFC13,458,The NC Chair commented that without Mexico present it would be difficult to revisit the recommendations; NC should instead reconvene next year.
WCPFC13,459,"EU noted that Mexico was a big fisher of Pacific bluefin tuna but was not a member of the NC or WCPFC. From this CCM’s point of view, the presence of Mexico was not essential for revisiting the recommendations."
WCPFC13,460,The Chair noted the lack of consensus to adopt the NC recommendations and held the discussions open for CCMs to hold consultations.
WCPFC13,461,"On 9 December the NC Chair reported on the extraordinary meeting of NC which had been held on 8 December at WCPFC13 (Attachment P). The extraordinary meeting had discussed the possibility of taking additional measures to expedite the rebuilding of the Pacific bluefin tuna stock. The NC Chair noted there was limited time, and the outcomes were also limited as many NC members did not have a mandate to go further."
WCPFC13,462,"The NC Chair noted that NC had discussed with Mexico the possibility of it also taking extra measures, but the Mexico delegation had no mandate to proceed. And USA had proposed to send additional scenarios to be analysed by ISC."
WCPFC13,463,The Chair thanked NC and the Chair of NC for its additional work and measures.
WCPFC13,464,"EU welcomed the additional steps but considered them not sufficient in light of the gravity of the stock’s situation. EU felt that fundamental questions remained unsolved. Regarding the voluntary measures taken by Japan and Korea’s catch transfers, EU felt it was difficult to understand the conservation impact of the measures and the Commission should give a clear mandate to do more when establishing the rebuilding target required under CMM 2015-04. EU requested that in order to WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 67 of 361adopt the NC report Attachment E, Para. 1(c) should be amended to ‘rebuild to 20% b0 by 2030 with at least 60% probability,’ which would be a clear mandate for what to achieve next year. EU also made a recommendation relating to the emergency rule, noting it was paramount to adopt an emergency rule this year."
WCPFC13,465,FFA members could accept the NC12 report and the extraordinary meeting of NC advice as long as there was a stronger commitment to develop the rebuilding strategy and the agreed decision language from WCPFC13 included the following additional text:   “The NC will deliver a properly developed and resourced rebuilding strategy by WCPFC14. The strategy will include specified actions and timeframes to rebuild to the 20% spawning biomass reference point by 2030 and be based on triggering of the emergency rule.”
WCPFC13,466,"Chinese Taipei considered the request to amend the rebuilding strategy at WCPFC13 rather than through the NC report was problematic. In addition, the stock was not the only consideration: the Commission should also be concerned with socio-economic impacts. It was noted that the stock was shared with IATTC. Chinese Taipei suggested the Commission could instruct NC13 in 2017 to do its best to develop additional measures."
WCPFC13,467,"Japan noted the concerns expressed by EU and FFA members and commented that the conditional nature of their request meant that if the conditions are not agreed, the NC report would not be adopted, including recommendations which will contribute to the recovery of the Pacific bluefin tuna, an outcome contrary to the objective. Japan needed to undertake internal consultations to further consider the EU and FFA conditions, noting it was a drastic change from what NC had agreed in a step by step approach. Japan further noted that the next rebuilding target may not be the final rebuilding target. Japan hoped if EU and FFA could agree to B0 20% by 2034 rather than 2030 with more than 60% probability, it could help with internal consultations and that next year’s NC could agree an emergency rule."
WCPFC13,468,EU explained that 2030 date was chosen for second rebuilding target was because it is two generations. EU could agree 2034 at the limit but preferred 2030. EU would like an emergency rule establish in 2017 with advice from ISC defining hard limits that should not be broken or they would trigger the emergency rule.
WCPFC13,469,"Regarding the 2030 date, Japan noted the current rebuilding timeline is 7% by 2024 and 2024 to 2030 is only six years. Japan stated that it had wanted to come up with a reference point trigger as EU had suggested but ISC had said it was not possible. Japan would approach ISC again on this."
WCPFC13,470,FFA advised that it would be comfortable with either 2030 or 2034.
WCPFC13,471,"The Chair noted that under the rules of procedure the Commission cannot change the recommendations; it can only reject or accept them. However, the Commission could accept the formulation of an additional recommendation."
WCPFC13,472,"USA hoped to see the proposal from the FFA in writing as it appeared to be based on a proposal USA had put to the NC which had included a meaningful emergency rule. USA considered it unfortunate that NC had not been able to come up with recommendations that made more progress to rebuild Pacific bluefin tuna more rapidly. But there are explicit rules about how the Commission and NC are to interact and the extent to which the Commission can influence NC decisions and while the Commission has a significant role, USA considered the current discussions to be outside of the rules. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 68 of 361It would at least take a reconvening of NC to make the changes that were under discussion and given the detail of the proposals were beyond what the rules allowed. USA hoped the Commission could find a way forward that was consistent with the rules but also makes incremental progress."
WCPFC13,473,"The Legal Advisor, Dr Penny Ridings, explained the rules dealing with NC (Article 11(7) of the Convention and Annex 1 of the Rules of Procedure). NC adopts recommendations on conservation and management for Northern stocks. Commission decisions on those stocks are to be based on recommendations of NC. The Commission may return recommendations to the NC for more work. The Commission cannot take a measure on Northern stocks without NC but it may request NC to formulate and send back a recommendation on a CMM. The Rules of Procedure are not specific about how specific that request may be but in general it is in the hands of the Commission as to how it wishes to formulate its request to NC."
WCPFC13,474,"Japan noted that the Commission may ‘request’ NC to formulate a CMM, under the rules, and supported USA’s interpretation. EU agreed with the Legal Advisor’s interpretation. With it not defined how specific the Commission can be in its request, EU considered there to be no legal obstacle to the Commission formulating a specific request for NC."
WCPFC13,475,"The NC Chair confirmed NC would accept a request from the Commission and consider it at NC13. In addition, the NC Chair invited all FFA members to NC and advised that EU would participate in the joint meeting with IATTC in 2017. Through these processes, NC would be able to take account of their particular views."
WCPFC13,476,"USA advocated making it clear that the Commission accepted NC12’s recommendations, as well as formulating a specific request relating to its future work. USA expressed some concern about the specificity of the EU/FFA request, considering that the Commission formulates such things as rebuilding plans, limits and emergency rules through scientific advice required and deep deliberations among members. USA agreed that the Commission has a responsibility and should be making demands of the NC, but it also needs to respect the role of coastal states and engage them in formulating what ultimately comes back for the Commission’s consideration."
WCPFC13,477,"EU observed that there was no procedural obstacle to the Commission being very specific in its request, and noted it was not in a position to accept generic language."
WCPFC13,478,"The Chair asked interested parties to craft a request to NC on Pacific bluefin tuna and late in the meeting FFA and EU presented draft language related to the adoption of the NC12 Summary Report, and this was considered under agenda item 11.2."
WCPFC13,479,The Commission accepted the report of the extraordinary meeting of NC at WCPFC13 (Attachment P).
WCPFC13,480,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2016-04 Conservation and Management Measure to establish a multi-annual rebuilding plan for Pacific Bluefin tuna (Attachment Q), which will replace CMM 2015-04. 9.6 Bridging Tropical Tuna CMM"
WCPFC13,481,"The Chair presented a revised bridging Tropical Tuna CMM for discussion and consultation purposes (WCPFC13-2016-20_rev2), intended to be the successor measure for the current CMM 2015-01 which will lapse at end of 2017. It was noted that the Commission will agree on a process for progressing the bridging measure for adoption WCPFC14. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 69 of 361"
WCPFC13,482,"Japan noted its statement regarding fishing capacity, given under agenda item 9.2.2."
WCPFC13,483,"RMI flagged that the bridging measure should engage with the issues around ‘impracticality’ regarding transhipment, and signalled it hoped to work with others on this."
WCPFC13,484,"The Chair noted the development of the current measure included a preliminary discussion in Tokyo over five days, with members focused exclusively on the tropical tuna measure."
WCPFC13,485,"USA noted the Commission had a tremendous amount of work to be done to draft and agree a new tropical tuna measure, noting that the Chair had started the work. USA was concerned that the Commission would not be able to resolve the myriad issues in one or two meetings (intersessionally plus WCPFC14) in order to agree a measure. The new measure would be looking at the use of harvest control rules and MSE for these stocks, new ideas for how to manage them (for example, spatial management as a way to better focus efforts to reducing longline bigeye tuna mortality). USA understood that working electronically was difficult for some members so was not an ideal way to progress, but this method could be used over an extended period of time to at least advance the structure of the text, identify the issues to be addressed, perhaps work on some of the paragraphs and language that would not be dependent on scientific advice. This would ideally be done well in advance of an intersessional meeting in order to better incorporate scientific advice. Intersessional meetings could be held between SC and TCC and in October. USA stated its willingness to investigate the possibility of supporting a meeting."
WCPFC13,486,Australia saw the bridging measure as very important and that all relevant parties be able to participate. Australia would also explore options around hosting or contributing.
WCPFC13,487,"The Chair reminded delegations that neither the CDS-IWG, FADMgmtOptions-IWG nor ERandEM WG would be meeting in 2017. It was noted that electronic communication was a way forward so long as no parties felt excluded. The Chair noted the tentative timing suggested by USA and the generous offers of possible assistance from USA and Australia."
WCPFC13,488,"Japan agreed that there would need to be intersessional work through electronic or preparatory meetings; the next annual meeting would not be enough to resolve all the issues. This CCM noted, however, that October was the busiest month of the year for international meetings and while supporting the concept was reluctant to support a meeting between TCC and the Commission meeting."
WCPFC13,489,"While noting the difficulties of limited administrative capacities, FFA members noted the priority of the bridging measure work and agreed to the preparatory work. Meeting electronically was appropriate to allow all parties to engage. It was noted that FFA and PNA would also be scheduling sub-regional meetings on these issues."
WCPFC13,490,"EU suggested that an intersessional meeting would need to take place after SC so the results of the stock assessment could be taken into account. EU had no specific preference whether meetings should be back to back with already-scheduled meetings such as TCC and SC, or separate. One option was also back to back with NC in Korea. EU noted that last time after the workshop in Tokyo the discussion was supposed to continue at TCC, however participants at TCC were compliance managers not fisheries managers so the discussion was not fruitful."
WCPFC13,491,"The Chair noted the general agreement to hold at least one intersessional meeting and there was no perfect time to hold it. It was agreed that the Chair and the Secretariat explore options and circulate them early in the new year, after discussions with Australia and USA regarding assistance. The Chair WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 70 of 361also noted the parallel process for the South Pacific albacore bridging measure. It was suggested this be progressed electronically then, if it makes sense, a meeting could be held."
WCPFC13,492,WCPFC13 noted the following issues would also be progressed as part of or alongside the development of the bridging measure: purse seine capacity management and high seas transhipment controls.
WCPFC13,493,"WCPFC13 agreed on the following process for tropical bridging measure: a. commence work on bridging measure electronically in the early part of 2017, focussing on the structure of the measure and provisions that are not dependent on scientific advice (noting the intention to move MCS measures into existing MCS measures as needed). Best efforts will be made to make this electronic process as inclusive as possible. b. agree to task the Secretariat with exploring options and potential funding for hosting a WCPFC meeting following SC13, to further progress the bridging measure on tropical tuna.  AGENDA ITEM 10 — BYCATCH MITIGATION 10.1  Sharks 10.1.1 Review of CMM 2010-07 and CMM 2014-05 10.1.2 New proposals"
WCPFC13,494,CCMs with proposals to refine and amend CMM 2010-07 and CMM 2014-05 outlined them under this agenda item. EU proposal on sharks
WCPFC13,495,"EU introduced WCPFC13-2016-DP07, a proposal to prohibit the removal of shark fins at sea, the retention on board, transhipment and landing of shark fins, and implementation of a Commission fins naturally attached policy as the way to monitor the prohibition of shark finning. EU stated that SC has said for some time that the only way to enforce the WCPFC ban on finning is by implementing a fins naturally attached policy, and recalled long discussions at TCC that demonstrated the difficulty of monitoring, evaluating and assessing the ratio. EU noted observer reports and high seas boarding inspections which identified that finning occurs in the Convention area. EU noted that NEAFC and NAFO have adopted fins naturally attached policies."
WCPFC13,496,"Japan’s position on a fins naturally attached policy remained the same as during past discussions. Japan considered there were operational difficulties for longline vessels, especially the frozen type. Japan also expressed concern about the number of observations of shark finning and the retention of prohibited species. Before WCPFC brings in new measures for sharks, Japan wanted the Commission to focus on the full utilisation of sharks since prohibition of finning practices is aimed at achieving this objective. Japan recalled it had proposed at TCC that all available information on how each CCM implements paragraph 6 of CMM 2010-07 should be reviewed as a first step towards ensuring compliance with the full utilization requirement. Japan sought a review of compliance on full utilisation requirement every year beginning in 2017. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 71 of 361"
WCPFC13,497,Australia thanked the EU for putting the proposal forward and noted it was concerned about shark management. Australia had domestic measures in place that would enable it to support the prohibition on shark finning. Australia noted the divergent views but noted the issue was very high on other international agendas. WCPFC was under scrutiny and needed to come to a consensus position on the sustainable management of bycatch.
WCPFC13,498,"USA supported sharks being landed with their fins naturally attached as USA does in its domestic fisheries. This CCM considered it operationally feasible without degrading the quality of the fins, endangering the crew or over-burdening the vessels. USA considered it necessary that the prohibition on finning be upheld; it would also improve the data on which SC based its scientific advice. USA expressed some concern with implementation of the EU proposal’s prohibition on selling."
WCPFC13,499,"China thanked EU for its efforts but agreed with Japan’s comment. China did not think paragraph 3 of the proposal, prohibiting the sale or purchase of shark fins taken in contravention of the proposed measure, was practical or feasible. China asked what the mechanism was to monitor it and whether a catch document would need to be attached to each product. Without a system in place it would be very difficult for market countries to implement the prohibition. China would continue working with others to find a solution."
WCPFC13,500,"PNG was disappointed that there was no mention in the proposal of domestic policies, noting that PNG had been working for some time to get measures together domestically. PNG had wanted to see paragraph 11 retained containing exceptions for artisanal fisheries."
WCPFC13,501,Canada supported the principle of the proposal and noted the review Canada had undertaken domestically and would be moving away from the 5% ratio methodology to a fins naturally attached policy in its domestic fisheries and positions internationally. Canada expressed a willingness to work with others to look at the proposed approaches including the issues China had raised.
WCPFC13,502,"FFA members noted their concerns over a long period of time about the 5% fin to carcass ratio including SC12 advice that the application of the rule is ineffective. FFA preferred that finning be prohibited. The EU proposal called for fins naturally attached but also allows for fins to be cut, to allow them to be folded back. FFA members supported this for all high seas fishing and for members who cannot demonstrate that a species-specific weight ratio is enforceable. FFA members did not support the inclusion of additional reporting requirements in the measure (paragraphs 7 and 8), considering it more appropriate to include these requirements in Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission decision."
WCPFC13,503,"EU expressed disappointment in the lack of consensus. EU offered to remove paragraph 3 on selling and explained that the proposal did not have an additional data burden – a lot of data is already required under current data provision obligations. EU considered ratios to be unviable from a monitoring point of view and trying to determine species specific fin to carcass ratios was problematic. EU noted its fleet fishes for sharks and demonstrated that the fin to carcass ratio was operationally feasible. Regarding retaining paragraph 11 on artisanal fisheries, EU did not favour exceptions for any purposes as exceptions create loopholes."
WCPFC13,504,"China noted that its problem with paragraph 1 (prohibiting the removal of shark fins at sea and the retention on board, transhipment and landing of shark fins) related to how to achieve implementation. Sharks at their first landing may have fins naturally attached, but then they go to market countries at which point a certificate from the port state might be necessary, which represents a burden for SIDS and another obligation for the flag state. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 72 of 361"
WCPFC13,505,"The Chair noted the lack of consensus on the EU proposal but also support to keep strengthening CMM 2010-07. The Chair noted Japan’s reference to a requirement to include information in CCMs’ Annual Reports Part 2 demonstrating how full utilisation was being implemented and why it was impracticable to implement a fins naturally attached policy. And TCC had asked to strengthen the measure for compliance purposes as it has not been able to assessment the ratio. So the issue was circular. The Chair sought a way forward that commits the Commission to looking at the issue in alternative ways, for example doing a comprehensive review of the shark measures or tasking SC and TCC to do more specific work."
WCPFC13,506,"EU volunteered to draft some text for a way forward. After EU’s consultations in the margins and extensive discussion in plenary on 9 December, the following language was agreed:"
WCPFC13,507,"WCPFC13 requested that SC13 and TCC13, with support from the Secretariat, work towards the development of a comprehensive approach to shark and ray conservation and management with a view to adopting a new CMM at the Commission’s annual meeting in 2018. The new CMM should seek to i) unify the WCPFC’s existing shark CMMs; ii) take account of relevant national and international policies and measures; and iii) provide a framework for adopting new components as needs and datasets evolve. Elements that could be considered for the new CMM include: - policies on full utilization/prohibition on finning; - no retention policies; - safe release and handling practices; - gear mitigation, size limits or closures; - management plans/catch limits; - key species and their assessment schedules; - species-specific limit reference points; and - any data reporting requirements beyond those contained in “Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission.” CMM 2014-05"
WCPFC13,508,The Chair noted recommendations from SC12 and TCC12 regarding shark management plans. The reference paper for this discussion was WCPFC13-2016-21.
WCPFC13,509,"Japan noted that SC and TCC had developed some recommendations on shark management plans. Japan supported the SC and TCC recommendations noting Japan had submitted its shark management plan of offshore longline fleets based on Kesennuma fishing port in accordance with paragraph 2 of CMM 2014-05 and implementation had begun on 1 January this year, including on prohibition of the use of shark lines and a landing limit for blue and mako sharks. Japan stated that it implements this plan to contribute to the conservation and management of sharks. Japan asked members who had not developed the plans according to new procedures agreed at the Commission to do so."
WCPFC13,510,"FFA members noted their previous supported for a ban on both shark lines and wire trace. While this was not achieved in 2014, it was a start and these CCMs continued to take the view that a ban on WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 73 of 361both is necessary to effectively conserve sharks. These practical mitigation measures are key to reducing the capture and mortality of shark species, including high priority stocks that are covered by their own CMMs. Regarding the development of future management plans, these CCMs supported using the template developed in Annex E of WCPFC-TCC12-2016-19. However, FFA members did not feel it was necessary to spend more time trying to define targeted shark fisheries. These CCMs preferred to focus efforts on banning wire trace and shark lines for any fishery that does not have a management plan."
WCPFC13,511,"EU supported the recommendations and the shark management plan template but disagreed with the recommendations regarding the longline fishery targeting sharks. EU considered that the plan should cover all fisheries that catch sharks not just those that ‘target’ sharks. Work needed to continue towards a common definition of what a ‘targeted fishery’ was, though EU was concerned about the prospect of another circular discussion without any progress; so it preferred a pragmatic approach."
WCPFC13,512,"The Chair commented on how difficult it has been for WCPFC to agree a definition of “targeted” shark fishing and noted the excellent work Dr Shelley Clarke (Secretariat) did at SC trying to take the Commission forward on this, though agreement had not been reached. The Chair reiterated the need for the Commission to find an alternative way of dealing with the issue.  10.2 Seabirds  10.2.1 Review of CMM 2012-07"
WCPFC13,513,The Chair noted the reference paper for this agenda item was WCPFC13-2016-21. There was no discussion under this item.  10.2.2 New proposals 10.2.2 FFA members’ proposal to amend CMM 2015-03 on seabirds
WCPFC13,514,"FFA members introduced their proposal (WCPFC13-2016-DP19), to provide greater protection to a number of seabird species of conservation concern at high or very high bycatch risk. SC agreed that the main area of at-risk seabird distribution was south of 25°S and that there was sufficient evidence to move the boundary of the southern seabird measure further north, though did not specify where. FFA members proposed a boundary at 26.3°S, following discussion at SC and TCC – a pragmatic balance between achieving a high level of conservation benefit and minimising compliance burden. Even low numbers of birds caught as bycatch in the areas between the current boundary of 30°S and the proposed 26.3°S represent a high or very high risk for already vulnerable bird populations. These CCMs acknowledged the propose would require French Polynesia to implement the seabird mitigation for the first time, and noted French Polynesia’s efforts this year to seek funding to trial seabird mitigation in their fleet. FFA members consider the proposal was the most practical option to addressing the high to very high risk of bycatch of vulnerable seabirds in this southern part of the WCPFC. It could be implemented immediately by a small handful of nations already familiar with seabird mitigation techniques."
WCPFC13,515,"China noted that the issue had been discussed at TCC, with one CCM discussing the difficulty of implementation. China had not conducted consultations with its industry so could not agree to the proposal right away, but hoped to come back on this during the meeting."
WCPFC13,516,"As a DWFN already implementing seabird mitigation measures, Korea did not have a specific problem with the proposal, but wanted to see language that encouraged coastal states to make their WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 74 of 361best efforts to mitigate interactions taking place in their waters. Korea noted CCBST, to which Korea is a party, had adopted a similar arrangement."
WCPFC13,517,"Australia noted it strongly supports improved mitigation measures for seabirds and is concerned about threatened species. Australia supported the FFA proposal, and applies – and will continue to apply – measures south of 25°S. Australia added that from its experience, these measures work, and fishing can continue."
WCPFC13,518,EU and USA supported the extension of protections to these additional areas.
WCPFC13,519,"French Polynesia was concerned about protection of seabirds and marine species. It has established a marine mammal sanctuary in its EEZ since 2002, implemented a ban on shark fishing operations and trade since 2006, and classified birds as endangered species in the French Polynesia EEZ, seabirds and some species of petrel. Establishing the whole EEZ as a marine managed area, “Tainui atea” enabled French Polynesia to implement binding measures in specific areas and for species wherever necessary. French Polynesia’s fleet has very few accidental catches of seabirds. This CCM considered it important to implement the same rules across the whole EEZ. French Polynesia could not support the implementation of the measure on its domestic longline fleet until mitigation trials have been conducted in its EEZ, and evidence of catch of concerned species has been demonstrated. It was noted that French Polynesia’s fleet does not fish in the area between 25°S and 30°S and queried why it needed to implement mitigation measures in areas its fleet did not operate. However, French Polynesia acknowledged the potential for fishery development in this area, and noted that the implementation of mitigation measures without evidence of interactions between seabirds and fishing operations would burden small domestic longliners. French Polynesia remained open to discussions to build a common and constructive proposal."
WCPFC13,520,"Japan noted that its position since SC had not changed, and the proposal to shift the southern boundary northwards was too definitive. Japan noted that all species reported were not ranked by IUCN as threatened, and there was no bycatch of Antipodean albatross and Campbell albatross recorded from 1992-2010 according to Japan’s observers’ and training vessels’ records. This CCM thought the 26.3°S boundary was artificial, without strong scientific justification. However, Japan was happy to continue discussions about mitigation at SC."
WCPFC13,521,"Indonesia advised that with the help of Birdlife International, Indonesia had developed its first National Plan of Action for seabird mitigation. While implementation remained a challenge for Indonesia, this CCM supported efforts to conserve seabirds. Indonesia noted that it is not in the range of the operation of the seabird mitigation requirements in FFA’s proposal."
WCPFC13,522,"Chinese Taipei commented that it was not difficult for it to implement the proposed measure but could not accept the proposal as the boundary was not based on scientific advice and had not been discussed at SC or TCC. In addition, the proposal would need to apply equally to all CCMs before Chinese Taipei could support it."
WCPFC13,523,"New Caledonia supported the proposal, noting that when creating marine parks it enforces alternative measures to sustainably develop its fisheries and protect seabirds and other bycatch."
WCPFC13,524,"Birdlife International commented that seabirds are difficult to identify, including those in the Wandering albatross group. Antipodeans albatrosses occur between 25°S and 30°S. This NGO noted that Japan’s national report indicated that its fleet catches species in the Wandering albatross group; Birdlife International thought they would be Antipodean albatrosses and while Japan indicated its fleet did not catch Antipodean albatrosses, they have not always been able to identify them to species level. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 75 of 361Based on the known distribution of the different species, the caught bird in Japan’s 2015 national report was identified as “Wandering albatross group” would be an Antipodean albatross; it is the species most likely in the region. Moving the boundary where seabird mitigation is required to be used by fleets further north towards 25°S would provide an urgently required greater level of protection for highly threatened seabirds known to be in these latitudes. BirdLife International noted that the Antipodean albatross, which breeds in New Zealand’s sub-antarctic islands, was is in big trouble because of adult mortality caused by fishing. It is considered critically endangered by New Zealand’s scientists. The new IUCN classification proposal would see it upgraded from vulnerable to critically endangered, based on recent data on population decline of 97.6% over 3 generations. Since 2004, males have declined by 5.3% and females by 8.1% annually, creating a serious sex imbalance in the population exacerbating the species’ troubles. Un-partnered males have been seen performing courtship rituals with other un-partnered males in the breeding colony. If the factors contributing to the species’ decline continue at this rate, BirdLife International stated that these birds are heading towards extinction within 2-3 generations, with the lack of management in WCPFC directly contributing to this outcome. This NGO considered it deeply concerning that CCMs seem unable to make such a minor concession – for vessels already using mitigation south of 30°S to also use it further north where there is high fishing effort and corresponding seabird mortality."
WCPFC13,525,"FFA members responded to comments from CCMs including in relation to the boundary proposed. They welcomed Japan’s recognition of SC12’s advice that these vulnerable seabirds are mostly distributed south of 25°S, and noted that the ideal boundary would be 17°S. The significance of a banded bird being recovered, as reported by a Japanese vessel, was noted. In response to Chinese Taipei’s concern, FFA members noted that discussions at the last Commission meeting centred on a 25°S boundary. This was dropped in the proposal to 26.3°S, in a practical bid to get a new boundary in place. It was noted that several nations would need to implement mitigation measures for the first time, and those CCMs with mitigation measures already in place were aware that it can take a couple of years, working with industry, to do so. FFA members considered 26.3°S was do-able immediately."
WCPFC13,526,"ACAP strongly supported the FFA proposal to amend CMM 2015-03, emphasizing that there is a range of species globally threatened with extinction that would benefit from amendment of the area of application, many of them listed under ACAP Annex 1. This list not only includes species like the Black petrel, the Antipodean albatross and the Campbell albatross, but also the Wandering, Indian yellow-nosed, White-capped and Shy albatrosses, among others. These seabird species have very small population numbers and are experiencing alarming declines in their populations. ACAP considered that urgent action was required to increase their level of protection, both through the effective implementation of CMM 2015-03 and the expansion of the area of application."
WCPFC13,527,The Chair noted that WCPFC13 did not have a consensus to adopt the proposal but encouraged CCMs wanting to move the forward to develop some report language as the basis for future discussions.
WCPFC13,528,"On 9 December, New Zealand noted SC12’s advice that “within the southern hemisphere part of the WCPO the main area of distribution for New Zealand’s vulnerable seabirds, especially the Antipodean albatross and the black petrel, is south of 25ºS.” However, after discussions in the margins and in plenary, New Zealand reported that consensus was not reached on where the boundary should be. FFA and colleagues at ACAP and Birdlife International looked forward to progressing this issue in the future.   WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 76 of 36110.3  Others  10.3 EU proposal on mobula and manta rays"
WCPFC13,529,"EU presented a proposal (WCPFC13-2016-DP06) which aimed to introduce a retention ban on mobula and manta rays in the Convention area and handling and live release guidance for specimens accidentally caught. EU noted that a similar measure was adopted in IATTC with the support of many members present at WCPFC13. The live release guidance was based on IATTC and WCPFC scientific recommendations and was discussed by SC. There were some data collection elements in the proposal and EU noted that in early consultations some concerns had been expressed about additional data requirements. However, EU noted that these data would be collected by observers and should not cause additional burden. EU considered that mobula and manta rays should be considered key shark species and therefore included in the shark research plan. At SC12 an informal small working group assessed the relevance of designating manta rays, mobulas and pelagic stingrays as WCPFC key shark species for data provision and/or assessment (developed at SC8). The informal small working group endorsed the conclusions of SC12-EB-WP-08 in terms of: presence in the Convention area, impact by WCPFC fisheries, ecological concerns and data availability. It was concluded that there are not enough data to undertake an assessment of the species. It was not agreed to designate these species as key shark species for data provision and/or assessment and SC12 recommended that the process for designation of key shark species be clarified. TCC12 confirmed that the process for designating key shark species allows for a species to be designated for assessment purposes only, to enable an assessment of the conservation status of these species. EU commented that key elements of its proposal, like the designation of manta rays and mobulas as key shark species and the adoption of guidelines for safe release of these species are a logical follow up from the progress achieved in SC12 and TCC12."
WCPFC13,530,"Noting that mobula and manta rays have been included in Appendix II by CITES, Korea advised that it is investigating implementing arrangements and data collection to fill data gaps. Korea expressed concern about the enforcement feasibility of the proposed setting ban for the two species. Korea could not accept the retention ban but would work constructively on finding solutions to the implementation problems."
WCPFC13,531,"PNA and FFA members could support the EU proposal if amendments were made to the data reporting requirements. At paragraph 4 there is a requirement to collect data on catch, discards and life status of manta rays and report in the Annual Report Part 1. While the data was important, FFA members supported including it in the required in Scientific Data Provided to the Commission, not in the proposed measure. These CCMs flagged that in future they would seek all reporting obligations to be reported in Scientific Data Provided to the Commission rather than housed in measures. FFA members noted that the move towards e-reporting was an opportunity to remind fishers of their obligations to report catch and discards for all species in their logbooks. This was especially relevant in longline fisheries where fishers have complained in the past of being limited by the number of rows on the paper forms."
WCPFC13,532,"The USA largely supported the proposal but had some concerns about the prohibition on circling and retention. At SC12 the USA had volunteered to update the safe handling and release guidelines, which should provide assistance; this CCM would work with EU on these issues."
WCPFC13,533,"Chinese Taipei expressed similar concerns, noting that there is unintentional catch, particularly in purse seine operations. It was noted that a domestic law had been enforced this year on the submission of manta ray catch notification.  This CCM commented that unintentional catch could be a compliance WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 77 of 361issue and hoped this can be taken into account in the wording.  It was noted that IATTC has a similar resolution on the exemption of purse-seine operations."
WCPFC13,534,"China recalled that a year ago IATTC agreed Resolution C-15-04 on the conservation of mobulid rays caught in association with fisheries in the IATTC Convention Area. Para. 2 of the Resolution provides that “in the case of Mobulid rays that are unintentionally caught and frozen as part of a purse-seine vessel’s operation, the vessel must surrender the whole Mobulid ray to the responsible governmental authorities at the point of landing” which is similar to the EU’s proposal. However, China noted there was no mechanism to monitor the prohibition on sale so preferred the reference be deleted. China committed to talk with EU in the margins about this."
WCPFC13,535,"Japan commented that the Commission needed some clear guidance and/or advice from SC on mobula and manta rays issues. While SC had discussed the species, no recommendation had been provided. Japan suggested passing the issue to SC for scientific consideration before discussing any management measure proposal on these species."
WCPFC13,536,"Indonesia expressed concern for the protection of mobula and manta, in particular to the two species such Manta birostris and Manta alfredi that since 2014 were fully protected in Indonesia, with penalties for catching, retaining or selling them. Indonesia informed that catch of these species were reported in the Indian Ocean and in Indonesia’s archipelagic waters, and were therefore not reported to WCPFC but they were discussed in CITES. Indonesia proposed further discussions on this issue at SC13."
WCPFC13,537,"WWF thanked EU for bringing the proposal forward, and recalled that Fiji was the lead proponent of the successful Mobula listing proposal put forward at CITES this year. WWF also noted that Japan made a statement at the CITES meeting that RFMOs were a more appropriate forum to manage species such as these."
WCPFC13,538,"Japan requested Dr Shelley Clarke to advise whether the data held on these species are adequate to support a detailed assessment, noting that if data are adequate to support assessment, those species are able to be designated for assessment only in accordance with WCPFC Process for Designating Key Shark Species for Data Provision and Assessment as agreed at TCC12. Japan recalled that TCC12 confirmed designation of key shark species for assessment only does not involve new reporting requirements."
WCPFC13,539,Dr Shelley Clarke (Secretariat) replied that the process of designating a key shark species refers whether there are data to support detailed assessment – not a stock assessment. She noted there are several species already on WCPFC’s key shark species list that do not have sufficient detail to support a stock assessment but do have sufficient data to support an indicator assessment or other analyses. In her opinion there are sufficient data to support a detailed assessment of mobula and manta rays.
WCPFC13,540,"Later in the meeting EU, after consulting with CCMs that had expressed concerns, advised the Commission that most, if not all, the concerns could be accommodated. A revised version would be submitted. If no agreement was reached, EU would prepare some language for the report. On 9 December, EU brought a rev2 back to plenary for discussion. The retention ban had been deleted but the requirement for vessels to release the specimens caught by using the guidelines on safe release contained in Annex 1 was retained. EU noted the collection of data did not create additional burden."
WCPFC13,541,"Japan could not support the revised draft, relating to paragraph 1’s requirement to release specimens unharmed. Japan stated there had been no recommendation from SC to request the Commission to protect this species. Japan recognised that these species were important for some members for reasons other than fisheries, and Japan did not object to those members taking stricter action than required by WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 78 of 361the Commission. However, that value was not necessarily shared by others, including Japan, so the question was only about whether or not there was a scientific justification for their protection. Japan hoped for a clear recommendation from SC so it could seriously consider supporting this proposal. Japan supported these species as key shark species, and collecting more data without imposing additional data burden, especially on developing countries."
WCPFC13,542,"USA noted that by listing them in Appendix II of CITES, the international community recognised mobula and manta rays were species deserving protection and additional management attention. This listing highlights that the Commission should look at how its fisheries interact with other species. USA was looking to work with EU on the proposal."
WCPFC13,543,"The Chair suggested there would not be agreement on the proposal at this meeting. EU would provide some agreed language to, among other things, ensure data could be collected in order to do the work the Commission needs for the future."
WCPFC13,544,"Japan clarified that its only problem with the proposal was the prompt release provision, and could support the other aspects. Chinese Taipei had the same concern and would join discussions with EU and Japan in the margins."
WCPFC13,545,"After those discussions had taken place and the matter was brought back to plenary, EU explained that with retention ban removed all that was left of substance was reporting and designation as a key shark species, which was not really enough for a CMM. In response to a query from PNG about the ROP elements, when the coverage rate problem is well known, EU explained that these species are mostly caught by purse-seiners."
WCPFC13,546,"Indonesia commented that it had mantas in its waters, and noted that there are many mobula species. Looking at the shark research plan, Indonesia asked if there were enough resources to conduct specific studies on these species."
WCPFC13,547,The Chair noted that any CCM could put these issues on the subsidiary bodies’ agendas.
WCPFC13,548,"Australia supported the language but noted that, regarding the language about observers, Australia had moved to an e-monitoring program for tuna fisheries in its EEZ."
WCPFC13,549,Fiji supported the language but sought clarification that USA will be working on updating the safe release guidelines at SC13. USA confirmed that it would be.
WCPFC13,550,"WCPFC13 adopted the following: 1. CCMs shall record where possible, through observer programs, the number of discards and releases of Manta and Mobula rays with indication of species (to the best extent possible), length, sex, status (dead or alive) and location caught 2. Manta and Mobula rays shall be considered WCPFC key shark species for assessment and thus listed under the Shark Research Plan, noting that data gaps may preclude a traditional stock assessment approach. 3. SC13 shall review, as appropriate, a revision of the ROP minimum standards data fields and develop safe release guidelines for Manta and Mobula rays, with a view to their adoption by WCPFC14. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 79 of 361 NC recommendation on blue sharks"
WCPFC13,551,"NC12 recommended that WCPFC13 decide if North Pacific blue shark should be designated as a northern stock, based on the available information from ISC, SPC and SC. The Chair noted that there was no recommendation from SC on this question. Consequently EU was hesitant to designate it as a northern stock. Japan noted that in 2016 a North Pacific blue shark stock assessment would be undertaken, which would give SC more information and allow it to consider the designation of the species as a northern stock."
WCPFC13,552,"SPREP made a statement about its strong commitment to sustainable development, including sustainable fisheries. Its interest in the marine realm is mainly bycatch of threatened and migratory species as well as marine debris. SPREP acknowledged Fiji’s role in shark and ray protection through CMS and CITES in particular and EU and USA supported Pacific Island Countries on silky sharks, thresher sharks and mobulas – all listed on CITES Appendix II. SPREP supported the EU proposal on mobula rays, which it saw as an opportunity for the Commission to support decisions taken by CITES, an international organization to which many WCPFC members also belong. This would be a clear signal of the Commission’s commitment to the sustainable use of wildlife. SPREP considered passing the issue to SC was no reason to defer discussion. The status of mobula rays had been discussed by the FAO Expert Panel and CITES and there was no need to reinvent the wheel. Regarding bycatch mitigation, SPREP recognised the role of SC and ROP reports, and Dr Shelley Clarke and the ABNJ project on turtle mitigation. SPREP noted comments at WCPFC13 about the low level of observer coverage and was encouraged by the rapid development of e-monitoring. SPREP hoped it would be actively consulted regarding mitigation of threatened species bycatch. Due to EU’s financial support, SPREP expected to be able to provide a substantive contribution. SPREP noted that one third of trip reports this year mentioned fishing vessels flouting MARPOL by dumping non-degradable waste at sea. SPREP was on the front line of climate change and ocean acidification and noted the impacts of changing seawater on yellowfin tuna larvae. Given the changing chemistry of the oceans, SPREP hoped to see a conservative approach to the exploitation of fish stocks. AGENDA ITEM 11 — ADOPTION OF REPORTS FROM SUBSIDIARY BODIES, INTERSESSIONAL WORKING GROUPS AND OTHER WORKSHOPS"
WCPFC13,553,"Taking the reports of the subsidiary bodies and intersessional working groups as read, the Commission considered recommendations coming from these bodies that had not been addressed under other agenda items. The Chair emphasised that adopting the reports also implied an adoption of the work plans within them. As they may have budgetary implications, FAC would also discuss them while completing its work in the margins of WCPFC13. 11.1 SC12"
WCPFC13,554,"FFA members noted the number of small working groups that were established in the margins of SC12. While highly effective in progressing matters by allowing for more focussed engagement, these CCMs considered that managing twelve working groups was a significant feat, particularly for small delegations. FFA members did not seek to limit the informal small working group practice, they sought some appropriate rationalisation so all CCMs can participate in and monitor the outcomes from the groups. In addition, FFA members commented on the volume of papers and issues to consider each year was increasing, and called on the SC Chair and theme convenors to ensure appropriate restraints are placed on the submission of papers to ensure that they are prioritised and aligned with the work WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 80 of 361tasked by the Commission. FFA members thanked the SC Chair, Ms. Berry Muller, for stepping in to fill the critical role of Chair at SC12 and nominated Dr. V. Chan (USA) as Data and Statistics Theme Convenor."
WCPFC13,555,"The Commission adopted the SC12 Summary Report (WCPFC13-2016-SC12), noting the recommendations with budgetary implications would be considered by FAC. 11.2 NC12"
WCPFC13,556,"Extensive discussions on the NC12 report took place during discussions on Pacific bluefin tuna, at agenda item 9.5."
WCPFC13,557,"At the request of the Chair, late in the meeting FFA and EU presented draft language related to a request to the NC regarding Pacific bluefin tuna."
WCPFC13,558,"After discussions with capital, Japan was able to support the amended text. Chinese Taipei also supported it. While EU preferred there to have been a clear recommendation in the language, it accepted the text."
WCPFC13,559,"The NC Chair requested that the NC12 report include the outcomes of the extraordinary meeting and an insertion at the end of paragraph 26 that “At WCPFC13, Japan attached the Position Paper at Attachment G.”"
WCPFC13,560,WCPFC13 adopted the NC12 Summary Report (WCPFC13-2016-NC12).
WCPFC13,561,"However, in adopting the report, WCPFC13 requested the Northern Committee to take due account of the following suggestions in accordance with Annex 1 of the Rules of Procedure: a. That NC13 develop conservation and management measures for adoption at WCPFC14 to rebuild the stock to 20% SBF=0 levels at the latest by 2034; b. That NC13 develop an emergency rule to be adopted at WCPFC14 which stipulates specific rules all CCMs shall comply with when drastic drops in recruitment are detected. For this purpose, the ISC is requested to define a drastic recruitment drop and associated risks.  11.3 TCC12"
WCPFC13,562,"Noting the reference paper listing the recommendations (WCPFC13-2016-23_rev1), the Commission considered the TCC12 report, work plan and recommendations, aside from those related to the CDS-IWG and the ERandEM WG which were considered separately in the agenda."
WCPFC13,563,"USA noted that TCC12 made two recommendations relating to transhipment (paragraphs 273 and 274 of the TCC12 Summary Report) and supported the recommendations. However, USA considered that the transhipment aspect of the ROP should be further developed, taking what IATTC has done as a model. USA considered it an appropriate task for the IWG-ROP to consider."
WCPFC13,564,"The Chair noted that this would require the IWG-ROP to reconvene in 2017, and if the Commission agreed to do that, CCMs should consider whether that would be a physical meeting or an electronic meeting. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 81 of 361"
WCPFC13,565,"In response to a query about the proposed guidelines on circumstances where it is impracticable for certain vessels to tranship in port or in waters under national jurisdiction (paragraph 37 of CMM 2009-06) prepared by the Secretariat, the Chair confirmed that TCC12 did not put forward any recommendations related to those draft guidelines. However, the Chair emphasised that a lack of a decision from a subsidiary body does not preclude the Commission from taking one. It was noted that the request for the Secretariat to prepare draft guidelines had been completed."
WCPFC13,566,"RMI was asked to present a way forward if it could, and it was noted that the Commission had not taken decision on the USA proposal to reconvene the IWG-ROP to consider the recommendation related to transhipment and ROP program. This was subsequently taken up in the discussions at agenda item 9.6 and high seas transhipment controls is identified as an issue to be progressed as part of or alongside the Bridging measures."
WCPFC13,567,"In respect of TCC12 recommendation paragraph 201, the updated Standards, Specifications and Procedures for the Commission VMS were approved (Attachment R)."
WCPFC13,568,"In respect of TCC12 recommendation paragraphs 275 and 448, the updated TCC Workplan 2016-2018 was approved (Attachment S)."
WCPFC13,569,The Commission adopted the TCC12 Summary Report (WCPFC13-2016-TCC12). 11.3.1 CDS–IWG
WCPFC13,570,"In the last two years work has accelerated on a WCPFC CDS, with agreement on objectives and much of the scope for a WCPFC CDS. Work on draft standards was one of two streams of work identified for 2015/2016, which was also the focus of the third meeting of the CDS-IWG which met on 16-17 September 2016 in Pohnpei. There were a number of recommendations in the CDS-IWG report (WCPFC-TCC12-2016-24_rev1), including recommendation that FFA Secretariat lead the continued further development of CDS data standards.."
WCPFC13,571,"EU did not object to the report, but flagged the difficulties it had with the process underway in the Commission: CCMs were creating their own IT traceability systems which could be extremely burdensome for CCMs as national IT environments will have to respond to WCPFC CDS requirements. This was a burdensome pathway, complicating trade flows. EU stated that because of the “phase in” described in the draft standards there was a risk that there will not, in the end, be a WCPFC CDS (because only CMMs meeting standards could use it) but a selective legal certificate possibly leading to two streams of product – certified and uncertified. This would lead to price differentiation, rather than achieving concrete results in combating IUU for a specific stock. EU noted it is both a market state and a fishing and processing party, and considered the standards would be difficult to comply with. The WCPFC CDS exercise was different to CDSs in other t-RFMOs. Unless it leads to an e-CDS platform like CCAMLR or ICCAT had developed, it would be difficult for the EU to commit to it in the future."
WCPFC13,572,The Chair noted that WCPFC13-2016-29 prepared by the FFA Secretariat refers to the draft CDS standards and presented a way forward. The Commission agreed that the CDS-IWG would not meet in 2017.
WCPFC13,573,"The Commission adopted the Summary Report of CDS-IWG03 (WCPFC-TCC12-2016-24_rev1), and noted the update from the FFA Secretariat on progressing the development of draft CDS standards (WCPFC13-2016-29). WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 82 of 361"
WCPFC13,574,The Commission noted that FAC had not allocated budget for a meeting of the CDS-IWG in 2017. 11.3.2 ERandEM WG 11.3.2 Proposal for ER data standards
WCPFC13,575,"The updated proposal for e-reporting standards and the recommendations of the ERandEM WG were contained in WCPFC13-2016-28, specifically in Annex A. It was noted that there were two supporting documents that should be considered with WCPFC13-2016-28: WCPFC13-2016-28 Annex A Attachment 1_rev1 provides the Electronic Reporting standards for Operational catch and effort data and WCPFC13-2016-28 Annex A Attachment 2 provides the Electronic Reporting standards for observer data."
WCPFC13,576,"EU could not support adopting the recommendations until its delegation had had discussions with SPC and the ERandEM WG Chair, Kerry Smith (Australia), about the documents presented. EU was confident its issues could be resolved with the addition of a reference to UN/CEFACT FLUX standards."
WCPFC13,577,"FFA members thanked the ERandEM WG Chair for her leadership and Peter Williams (SPC) for his efforts in accommodating late-submitted proposed changes to Annex A Attachment 1 and Annex A Attachment 2. These CCMs supported the adoption of the proposed e-reporting standards and noted that many members have, or are implementing, e-reporting. Regional standards were needed to ensure consistency and data quality."
WCPFC13,578,"In reference to Annex A Attachment 2 of the draft standards, Japan noted that it was starting to submit observer data electronically with its own standard and formats. If a new standard was agreed Japan would take time for changes to its system. This CCM asked for clarification that paragraph 3 of draft Electronic Reporting SSPs (WCPFC13-2016-28 Annex A) covers such concerns of members using their own format and standards. The ERandEM WG Chair acknowledged that countries would need some time to comply with the standards."
WCPFC13,579,"The ERandEM WG Chair noted that a range of countries are looking at e-reporting to support their decision making and meeting their obligations to Commission, and the data standards represent a first step. It was noted that the standards do not make e-reporting mandatory, they are not set in stone and the SSPs will be updated as matters progress. Paragraph 3 of the draft e-reporting standards acknowledges that countries will be working to e-reporting implementation using these standards and other forms of electronically reported data and, as appropriate, hard copy formats, will continue to be acceptable forms of reporting until decided otherwise by the Commission."
WCPFC13,580,The ERandEM WG Chair was thanked for moving this important work forward.
WCPFC13,581,"On 9 December, the discussion resumed with Japan joining the consensus and EU noting its support for adoption on the trust that it will be modified with the inclusion of the language on international standards. The Commission adopted the draft e-reporting standards consisting of Annex A and Annex A, Attachment 1_rev1 E-reporting Standard Data Fields Operational Logsheet Data. Annex A, Attachment 2 on E-reporting observer data standards was not agreed."
WCPFC13,582,"While the ERandEM WG report included a recommendation that another meeting of the group be held in 2017, CCMs were not of the view that the ERandEM WG needed to reconvene in 2017. The Chair noted that one option was to ask the Secretariat to progress the issue with those members (Japan WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 83 of 361and Chinese Taipei) who expressed some concern with Attachment 2 of the draft standards and report to TCC13."
WCPFC13,583,"The Commission adopted the Summary Report of the ERandEM Working Group second meeting (WCPFC-TCC12-2016-17) and noted the update on progressing the development of draft standards, specifications and procedures for Electronic Reporting (WCPFC13-2016-28)."
WCPFC13,584,"The Commission adopted the standards, specifications and procedures for Electronic Reporting, which presently include E-reporting standards for operational catch and effort data (Attachment T)."
WCPFC13,585,"The draft E-reporting standards for observer data, high seas pocket reporting and reporting in the event of VMS malfunction should continue to be revised based on comments provided by CCMs in 2017."
WCPFC13,586,The Commission supported TCC12 recommendation (TCC12 paragraph 330) that the ERandEMWG continue its work under the same terms of reference for another two years.
WCPFC13,587,"The Commission noted that FAC had allocated a budget for a meeting of the ERandEMWG in 2017, but agreed that a budget for a formal meeting of the ERandEMWG in 2017 was not necessary. 11.4 FADMgmtOptions–IWG"
WCPFC13,588,"The Commission considered the recommendations of the FADMgmtOptions-IWG in reference paper WCPFC13-2016-32, including a recommendation that a formal meeting of the FADMgmtOptions-IWG is not envisaged in during 2017.  The full report is provided as WCPFC13-2016- FADMgmentOptions-IWG-02_rev2."
WCPFC13,589,"EU considered the work of the group to be important and thanked the FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair, Brian Kumasi (PNG) for his work moving the issues forward. EU expressed disappointment that the working group was not proposed to reconvene in 2017 but hoped that the work would continue, including on data collection, FAD marking and management options. This CCM considered it important to coordinate with other t-RFMOs, and noted that the IATTC ad hoc Working Group on FADs recently invited other t-RFMOs to convene a joint meeting which EU hoped WCPFC would attend. EU had some concerns with the research plan: the meeting in Pohnpei in September 2016 had identified five main areas of research. FAD design had been one of the research areas but it was not supported as high priority, which EU had favoured because it would have looked at biodegradable and non-entangling designs to reduce bycatch and impacts on the ecosystem, pollution and marine debris. Organisations in other fora were also conducting similar research, for example on acoustic FADs, and there would be advantages in coordinating. EU wanted this kind of research included in the research supported by the Commission."
WCPFC13,590,"The FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair thanked the CCMs which met for the working group at the end of TCC, noting that not all interested parties were present so some recommendations were not to the liking of some CCMs. The Consultant’s Report on marking and monitoring, and cost implications, were the focus of discussions on research priorities. Noting that six out of the seven terms of reference were completed, the FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair observed that FAD-related work could continue through the subcommittees, for example data collection through the TCC work program and research through the SC work program."
WCPFC13,591,"Japan expressed its desire to continue to work with other members on what was for Japan the most concerning area of FAD management – reducing bycatch of juvenile fish, especially bigeye tuna. In WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 84 of 361relation to this topic Japan sought TCC’s consideration of a practical implementation of definition of FADs noting several vessels were alleged to violate prohibition of setting on FADs due to possible strict implementation of the definition."
WCPFC13,592,"FFA member CCMs did not support the proposal for a joint t-RFMO FAD working group. The FADMgmtOptions-IWG has already achieved most of what it was designed to stimulate, with research activities ongoing. 85% of the FAD sets reported in this region take place in the national jurisdictions of FFA members, and trials of a range of FAD management measures are ongoing under the PNA umbrella. In 2017 FFA members wanted to focus on developing the bridging CMMs for the major tuna stocks without distractions. These CCMs advised that when trials and research activities have results to disseminate, they will do so."
WCPFC13,593,"EU could not understand the rationale for not wanting WCPFC to attend a meeting of all the t-RFMOs to discuss FADs and considered there was a lot to gain by hearing other experiences, different management methods, other research, and bringing forward best practices. EU did not see that there was any negative effect of attending such a meeting and marked its strong support for attending."
WCPFC13,594,"USA and Japan agreed, noting that it was a useful way to collaborate at a small cost and the majority of global FAD operations took place in the WCPO."
WCPFC13,595,"Korea also supported WCPFC’s participation in the t-RFMO meeting and aligned itself with EU, USA and Japan, considering there may be much to gain from such a workshop. Korea noted that FFA members may think it did not gain much from the Kobe process, but each time a stock assessment is presented, the plot which is used to describe the data is gained from the Kobe process."
WCPFC13,596,"FFA members wanted to develop high standards of FAD management in the tropical WCPO area, and suspected that a global dialogue would result in lower standards that will assist FAD-dependent distant-water fishing fleets to maintain a competitive advantage at the expense of bigeye and bycatch stocks. FFA members considered that the Kobe process did not work in the interests of FFA members and were loathe to engage in it further. It started as a collaborative process to share experiences and lift standards and went to a process of lowest common denominators, providing a forum for countries to push measures that had been rejected in WCPFC."
WCPFC13,597,"On behalf of The Pew Charitable Trusts, SFP, American Tunaboat Association, ISSF, Greenpeace, WWF, PEW urged the Commission to establish mechanisms that assure timely and updated reporting of data on FADs, including on the activities of purse seine support vessels. The FADMgmtOptions-IWG’s terms of reference specified recommending a way forward on management options for FADs. These observers believed this work is incomplete. If the FADMgmtOptions-IWG is not to meet in 2017, it was important for the Commission to establish a clear process to ensure a continued focus in 2017 on improving management of the FAD fishery including substantive outcomes such as developing options that directly manage bigeye tuna in the FAD fishery. These observers stated that developing a more comprehensive approach to managing FADs should be a clear priority of the Commission. They also encouraged WCPFC to attend the joint RFMO working group on FAD management."
WCPFC13,598,The Chair suggested the Commission adopt the report on the understanding that work will continue in the subsidiary bodies.
WCPFC13,599,EU noted that the research plan was settled but regretted FAD design was not supported in it. EU did not agree to the priorities as they were formulated. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 85 of 361
WCPFC13,600,"The FADMgmtOptions-IWG Chair noted that the research activities were shared with SPC as part of the discussions about research priorities, to determine whether they were practical. SPC also looked at cost. It was noted that the subcommittees would continue to discuss the issue then WCPFC14 can decide how to progress."
WCPFC13,601,"The Commission adopted the Report of the second meeting of the FADMgmtOptions-IWG (WCPFC13-2016-FADMgmtOptions-IWG02_rev2), and agreed that the outcomes therein should be further considered at SC13 and TCC13."
WCPFC13,602,The Commission could not reach consensus on WCPFC attendance at the t-RFMOs meeting on FADs coordinated by ICCAT in 2016. Consequently the WCPFC Executive Director would not participate in that discussion.
WCPFC13,603,The Commission noted the invitation from ICCAT related to the 2017 FAD-IWG Joint tuna RFMO meeting (WCPFC13-2016-35). The Secretariat was tasked to convey WCPFC’s regrets to the ICCAT Secretariat.  AGENDA ITEM 12 — ADOPTION OF FINAL COMPLIANCE MONITORING REPORT
WCPFC13,604,The reference paper summarising the additional information submitted by CCMs as a reply to TCC12 provisional CMR was WCPFC13-2016-30.
WCPFC13,605,"On 9th December, the TCC Chair, Alexa Cole (USA) reported that the CMR informal small working group had completed its work on the final CMR after a number of session during WCPFC13. The group had been able to complete assessment on almost all of the obligations. There were seven obligations where this was not possible and these were noted in the report. The TCC Chair recommended that further discussion would not progress the assessments and they should remain not assessed. Significant concerns were expressed by the working group with how the final CMR review was conducted at WCPFC13, noting the large number of working groups which were progressing Commission work in the margins, some of which were concurrent. It also difficult to conduct the review in such a piecemeal fashion. The working group put forward a recommendation that the work to review and evaluate the CMR be done in a standalone session and that the work be chaired by whoever is the TCC Chair at the time, and that the WCPFC Compliance Manager and Assistant Compliance Manager also attend, with assistance of the Scientific Service Provider."
WCPFC13,606,"The Chair agreed that the current process for finalising the CMR was not ideal and further consideration was needed. Options included adding an additional day, ahead of the Commission meeting, taking the view that the Commission would benefit from the compliance assessments being completed before the fishery managers met. The Chair noted that the measure clearly states who is responsible for preparing the final CMR – the Commission, not TCC – so an amendment or at least explicit acknowledgement was needed to implement the TCC Chair’s recommendation."
WCPFC13,607,EU proposed a dedicated day for the working group to do this complex and lengthy work.
WCPFC13,608,"A long discussion ensued as to how to constitute the working group ahead of the Commission meeting, given the Rules of Procedure. Under one option, the first day of the Commission meeting would be dedicated to analysis of the CMR; it would formally be a Commission meeting to be in compliance with the measure but in practice it would be run by the TCC Chair. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 86 of 361"
WCPFC13,609,"USA and Australia supported the proposal, with Australia agreeing that the number and concurrence of informal small working groups was unfortunate. Dealing with the additional compliance information early and finalising the CMR would free delegations up to focus on the rest of the Commission agenda."
WCPFC13,610,"The Executive Director noted that Commission meetings have formal openings before going into the scheduled agenda. Under this proposal, the Commission would work on the provisional CMR straight after the formal opening."
WCPFC13,611,"Queries about whether the Commission meeting could formally open but without the ceremonies, to ensure the Commission was officially constituted and whether the Commission could make the CMR working group meeting a special session of TCC were put to the Legal Advisor, who explained that the session of the Commission commences at the opening of that session; it can’t commence prior to the formal opening but the formal opening could be delayed by a day. The Commission would then convene as a session that looks at the CMR, after which the official opening would take place. The Legal Advisor suggested this might be preferable to trying to have a special session. In addition, it would have to be a special session of WCPFC13 not WCPFC14."
WCPFC13,612,"Another option put by the Chair was that the FAC and the HOD could convene on the Saturday, opening the Commission. On Sunday the CMR review could commence. On Monday the formalities could be undertaken."
WCPFC13,613,"RMI could not agree to amend the measure to have a meeting if it complicates the Commission meeting. This CCM preferred the status quo, noting the other arrangements suggested were messy and not provided for in the CMS measure."
WCPFC13,614,"Seeking a pragmatic solution, EU suggested that there simply be no concurrent meetings while the CMR work is undertaken."
WCPFC13,615,No agreement was reached and the Chair noted that the discussion could not profitably go further and closed the agenda item.
WCPFC13,616,The Commission accepted the Final Compliance Monitoring Report (Attachment U). Consideration of new deadlines for Annual Report Part 1 and Annual Report Part 2
WCPFC13,617,A discussion took place on the issue of deadlines for the Annual Reports Part 1 and 2 required by the Commission. Currently the Annual Report Part 1 is due 30 days prior to the annual SC meeting and the Annual Report Part 2 is due on 1 July each year. Moving the dates forward would positively affect the Secretariat’s development of the draft CMR. 16 June for both annual reports was the date recommended by the TCC Chair.
WCPFC13,618,"Indonesia stated that it would have difficulties meeting an earlier deadline, noting that its catch estimates are only become available in mid-June, after which Indonesia begins the development of the Annual Report Part 1. Indonesia proposed 6 July."
WCPFC13,619,"Japan supported Annual Report Part 1 being moved to 1 July with the Annual Report Part 2, but suggested that for Indonesia a footnote exemption could give it an extended deadline of 7 July."
WCPFC13,620,Vietnam noted it had the same difficultly as Indonesia and asked to be similarly considered. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 87 of 361
WCPFC13,621,New Zealand noted that an extended date does not help the Secretariat and suggested retaining the status quo if an earlier date could not be agreed.
WCPFC13,622,"Australia recalled discussions last year about the amount of processing time the Secretariat needed to prepare the draft CMR, and noted the need to give the Secretariat as much time as possible. This CCM was reluctant to support exemptions and extensions as this would not help in the long run."
WCPFC13,623,The Chair considered footnotes to be problematic and suggested continuing with the current deadlines.
WCPFC13,624,"In respect of TCC12 recommendation paragraph 27, WCPFC13 discussed and agreed to maintain the due dates for Annual Report Part 1 and Annual Report Part 2 in 2017. AGENDA ITEM 13 — ADOPTION OF WCPFC IUU VESSEL LIST"
WCPFC13,625,Adoption of the 2017 WCPFC IUU Vessel List took place under agenda item 6. The 2017 WCPFC IUU Vessel List is attached at Attachment L. AGENDA ITEM 14 — REPORT OF THE TENTH FINANCE  AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE 14.1 Report of the Tenth Finance and Administration Committee (FAC10)
WCPFC13,626,"The Commission considered the report of FAC10 (WCPFC13-2016-FAC10). The FAC Co-Chair Paul Callaghan (USA) thanked those CCMs that participated in the FAC sessions on 4, 7, 8 and 9 December 2016, some of which went late into the night, and Secretariat staff for their strong support of those sessions. Main recommendations included: the transfer of $100,000 from the Cooperating Non-Members Fund to the SRF to support the SRF for 2017 and the establishment of a virtual intersessional working group to review the current guidelines for the SRF; the conduct of a performance-based salary review for the Executive Director; a 2% increase for professional staff including the Executive Director; and interim support for establishing an E-reporting and E-monitoring technical coordinator position."
WCPFC13,627,"Japan noted that FAC10 did not reach consensus on funding for “Skipjack impacts on the margins of the Convention Area” with only one CCM strongly supporting its inclusion in the budget – Japan. Japan reported that it would implement the project itself in 2017 and so was able to join the consensus to remove the budget of the project from the Commission’s budget. Japan would report back to the Commission, perhaps at SC13."
WCPFC13,628,EU suggested that there might be areas where economies can be realised rather than spending hours in budget meetings trying square the circle of growing demands and limited resources. This CCM suggested a performance review could be beneficial.
WCPFC13,629,"The Commission adopted the Report of the Tenth Session of the FAC (WCPFC13-2016-FAC10) (Attachment V), including the eventual 2017 budget of USD $7,774,392 and indicative budgets for 2018 and 2019 of USD 8,174,205 and USD 8,201,857 respectively (Attachment W).  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 88 of 361AGENDA ITEM 15 — ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS 15.1 Strategic Plan"
WCPFC13,630,"The Commission considered the draft Strategic Plan for the Commission and Commission Secretariat. The Executive Director introduced it and offered some context around it. In 2010, six years after coming into existence, the Commission adopted a strategic plan. It was a three-year planning document, to 2013. WCPFC10 did not adopt the successor put forward by the Secretariat. The Commission considered that the lapsing Strategic Plan had not provided strategic guidance to the Commission, being more like a short term business plan and a consolidation of the SC and TCC work plans. There was a concern that it was a Secretariat-driven plan, with members lacking ownership and stakeholders not really contributing to its development. The Executive Director then made the Strategic Plan a priority and put a paper to WCPFC12 for a process to develop a more appropriate draft. That process was approved and is attached to WCPFC13-2016-31. The process was open and participatory, an independent facilitator helped develop the new draft plan and a workshop for members was held. The Executive Director explained that the Convention would remain the foundational document of the Commission. The Strategic Plan would set strategic directions over 10 years, prioritize priorities, guide the allocation of Commission resources and leverage the sourcing of additional resources. It would be supported by a shorter term Corporate Plan, to operationalise the Strategic Plan. The work plans of the SC and TCC and other subsidiary bodies would be required to strongly align with the Strategic Plan. From the Secretariat’s perceptive, such a corporate document would help them pursue additional resources from the many funding sources available."
WCPFC13,631,"With agreement to engage an independent facilitator, the Secretariat had tendered a consultancy. The Consensus Building Institute won the consultancy and collated the initial data and material. The high level strategic goals outlined in the draft Strategic Plan prepared by the consultancy were:  Adopt and implement harvest strategies and other tools to conserve and sustainably utilize fish stocks and manage interactions with the environment  Enhance compliance with conservation and management measures  Implement ecosystem-based management  Strengthen capacity of developing states, in particular small island developing states and territories, to manage and develop their tuna fisheries, and  Enhance Commission operations by deploying best available data and science and by enhancing transparency of Commission governance and operations."
WCPFC13,632,"EU welcomed the exercise, but noted that the difficult issues for the Commission are not addressed in the Strategic Plan. While all the goals were in line with the Convention, and noting the common goal of sustainable management of Western and Central Pacific fisheries, EU considered that it was not drafted in a way which was going to solve the Commission’s problems – with alternative managing measures adopted by subregional organisations and no real dialogue."
WCPFC13,633,"Japan also considered it a good exercise, but stressed that in future work on the Strategic Plan, anything beyond the Convention text would not be supported by Japan. This CCM suggested that plan was a living document.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 89 of 361"
WCPFC13,634,"FFA members outlined their views on the Strategic Plan in WCPFC13-2016-DP18: the process did not cater well to SIDS interests; the Strategic Plan must identify the highest priority elements of the Convention and help implement them; the current draft did not represent a viable way forward due to major policy differences that cannot be reconciled within a consensus set of priorities in the short term. FFA members were committed to working on a Strategic Plan and a Corporate Plan to guide and prioritise the work and resources of the Secretariat. These CCMs suggested instead of trying to agree on the current draft, WCPFC13 should identify a small number of agreeable strategic priorities that would comprise a Corporate Plan. The high priority strategic issues that FFA members wanted the Commission to focus on over the 10 years are: the protection of SIDS’ rights and interests, including through levelling the playing field through more effective implementation of Article 8; putting Harvest Strategies in place for all key tuna stocks or fisheries, which would help solve some of the Commission’s decision-making problems; improve the efficiency of CCM participation in WCPFC, including improving the ability of CCMs to comply with Commission obligations; the continual improvement in scientific advice based on enhanced fisheries-dependent data and fisheries independent research."
WCPFC13,635,"The Chair noted that the Commission was not in agreement to adopt the draft Strategic Plan, and the Commission discussed what decisions or process should flow from WCPFC13. As it was a living document, one CCM observed that it did not need to be adopted."
WCPFC13,636,"Australia agreed the plan needed more work, and indicated its support for whatever process was established. This CCM considered the FFA high priority strategic issues to be worthwhile. Australia reminded the Commission that the world is changing and the context in which fisheries management takes place needs to be taken into account – this included work in other fora which was important in planning the work of WCPFC."
WCPFC13,637,"The draft was not as detailed as USA had hoped for, and was missing issues USA had raised in its comments, such as capacity management. While not supportive of adoption of the presented version, USA acknowledged the importance of trying to develop a Strategic Plan for the Commission, to give members and the Secretariat clear guidance. USA recommended that work to further develop the Strategic Plan should be done by CCMs, not consultants, and was willing to contribute significantly to try and progress it over the next year with CCMs and the Secretariat."
WCPFC13,638,"The Chair and the Executive Director noted the partial acceptance by the Commission of the work done so far and that it should be done by CCMs and the Secretariat going forward. It was confirmed that no resources were presently dedicated to this work for forward years. The Commission decided to move ahead mostly electronically and if a more advanced product came of it, WCPFC14 could consider it."
WCPFC13,639,The Commission noted the draft Strategic Plan prepared by Consensus Building Institute (WCPFC13-2016-31).
WCPFC13,640,The Commission acknowledged progress on the draft Strategic Plan and tasked the Secretariat to work with interested CCMs and Observers to further refine the draft Strategic Plan and to initiate development of the Corporate Plan. 15.2 Participation of Observers
WCPFC13,641,"The Commission Legal Advisor (Dr Penny Ridings) presented a discussion paper on the participation of observers in meetings and activities of the Commission (WCPFC13-2016-33), as requested by WCPFC12. The paper outlined the increase in the number of WPCFC observers and the WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 90 of 361numbers of attendees at WCPFC meetings. In comparison with other t-RFMOs with a comparable number of observers, there was significantly higher number of NGO participants attending WCPFC Commission meetings. The Legal Advisor noted that while it would not be consistent with the Convention’s promotion of transparency to restrict the accreditation of observers or limit further their participation at WCPFC, concerns had been expressed about the number of attendees at meetings, due to the additional costs on the Secretariat and hosts of Commission meetings. Both IATTC and ICCAT set a fee for observer participation, and IOTC can under its Rules of Procedure. There are different methods for determining the level of any observer participation fee but the Secretariat suggested that if the Commission decides to establish a participation fee for Commission meetings, the approach in other tuna RFMOs should be adopted whereby the Executive Director sets a reasonable fee for observers participation. The Secretariat invited the Commission to consider whether any fee should be applied to NGO observers, but not to intergovernmental or non-parties including CNMs. WCPFC12 and TCC12 requested that the paper consider the issue of transparency, in particular access to meeting information and non-public domain data. The Legal Advisor noted that consideration of the draft CMR occurs in a closed working group session at TCC, based on the WCPFC’s data confidentiality rules and the fact that some CCMs had not agreed to have non-public domain data presented in open session. It was suggested that the Commission could consider the participation in closed sessions of IGO and NGO representatives subject to their meeting the WCPFC’s data protection rules, including maintaining the confidentiality of the discussions, not using the information provided for any other purpose, and not commenting publicly on any information obtained through access to the meetings. Sanctions for non-compliance with the requirements could be imposed. Para. 59 of the paper, sub-points A-F, set out guidelines that could be adopted along these lines."
WCPFC13,642,"EU noted that it has long supported the inclusion of observers in all aspects of the Commission’s work as they are valuable to the discussions, stating that WCPFC is the only t-RFMO that excludes observers from its compliance process. This CCM took the position that observers should be allowed to participate in the process, and transparency should not be conditional on fees being paid. However, EU acknowledged observers represent a cost to the Commission in requiring bigger venues and other costs so they should contribute."
WCPFC13,643,"Japan also supported the idea of observers paying a fee to participate, noting that other RFMOs have started the practice and currently the Commission picks up these extra costs. The fee should not be high but should cover the costs. Japan and USA felt the Executive Director could come up with an appropriate figure, taking into account the fees set by other organisations. USA also noted the importance of observer participation to transparency and their contribution to the successful work of RFMOs."
WCPFC13,644,"The Chair noted that the issue of NGO participation in the draft CMR sessions at TCC had been under discussion for some years and TCC spends time each year trying to determine whether they should be included. There were mixed views this year, and the fourth recommendation in WCPFC13-2016-33 sought to address this particular issue in the hope that it could be resolved."
WCPFC13,645,"Japan considered it useful for NGOs to attend the compliance session and, based on experiences at other RFMOs, noted that NGOs can provide information on possible non-compliance of members. Japan works with them on these issues. The proposed guidelines in paragraph 59 addressed confidentiality of information and Japan supported their development to address members’ concerns while allowing access to the CMR session for NGOs."
WCPFC13,646,"The Chair noted that the Rules and Procedures for the Protection, Access to, and Dissemination of Data Compiled by the Commission (the data rules) already include confidentiality arrangements. If WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 91 of 361agreement could be reached at WCPFC13, the Secretariat would develop the guidelines intersessionally."
WCPFC13,647,"USA took the view that a general presumption of access and transparency was the best policy, including for TCC, noting that this presumption applies in other organisations and has worked well. This CCM noted that there are circumstances in which confidential information needs to be discussed. Guidelines would allow the Chair to decide to discuss issues in closed session; they should not focus strictly on the TCC draft CMR discussions."
WCPFC13,648,"EU agreed with all the points in paragraph 59 and suggested formalising them, noting that observers would also have to agree with the guidelines. EU hoped it would not take another year to adopt them and suggested for the process to be finalised intersessionally, so that observers could be allowed to participate to next meetings."
WCPFC13,649,Australia was concerned that any new guidelines do not get confused with the existing provisions under paragraph 30 of the data rules about non-public domain data. Those procedures should be taken into account when preparing the guidelines. Australia commented that guidelines enabling broader observer participation should not need to wait for WCPFC14 to adopt them.
WCPFC13,650,"International Environmental Law Project (IELP) made an intervention on behalf of the IELP, American Tuna Boat Owners Association, BirdLife, Conservation International, Greenpeace, International Seafood Sustainability Foundation, PEW, SFP, and WWF. It was noted that observers provide substantial on-the-ground support through technical workshops and purchase of equipment, and technical expertise to CCMs. As such they are integral to the implementation of the Commission’s mandate. These observers did not object to reasonable fees for participation in annual Commission meetings (not TCC or SC, as NGO participation in these meetings is low) but wanted to ensure that NGOs from Pacific Island developing states are not disproportionately burdened. It was suggested that the first two representatives from any observer organization participate without paying a fee, with each additional representative charged a reasonable fee based on the incremental cost of observer participation. These observers did not believe that additional fees are warranted for participation in meetings of the Technical and Compliance Committee and the Scientific Committee. Consistent with Article 21 of the Convention, these observers took the view that NGOs should be allowed to participate fully in TCC meetings, including the CMR sessions; other RFMOs and multilateral environmental agreements allow NGO observers to do so. It would be best practice. To participate meaningfully in CMS discussions observers would need access to material including the draft CMR and other non-public domain information. These observers were not convinced of the need for a non-disclosure agreement, as the data rules cover confidentiality of CMR-related information but would do so if needed to gain the trust of CCMs and access to TCC discussions. If the Commission contemplates sanctions against observers for violations of the confidentiality rules, these observers felt the Commission should then establish a process for evaluating alleged breaches, to ensure fairness and transparency."
WCPFC13,651,"Noting that the Commission data rules are more limiting than those what is laid out in paragraph 59, USA noted that the definition of ‘documentation’ in sub-point c was unclear – in receiving the draft CMR, members are subject to the terms of the data rules. USA would be concerned if it were that material that is referred to in sub-point c."
WCPFC13,652,The Legal Advisor responded that the suggested guidelines in paragraph 59 were intended to be consistent with the data rules and the Secretariat would ensure the guidelines met the data rules. The Legal Advisor noted that the decision to open a meeting would be an acceptance that the data provided would be able to seen by others in that meeting. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 92 of 361
WCPFC13,653,"Fiji supported moving things forward, recognising that the Commission benefited from NGOs. Fiji wondered why no requests by observers for non-public domain data had been made and whether it was due to the difficulty of the process. If so, Fiji would not support having open sessions. This CCM asked what else needed to be in place before observers were allowed into closed sessions and what implications would accrue to observers if they that divulge information after signing the non-disclosure agreement. This CCM reminded delegates that draft CMR closed sessions handle information in its raw form, some of which are not cleared until the subsequent Commission meeting, and noted that if this information is released, damage to a member’s reputation could be irreversible."
WCPFC13,654,"USA offered to work with interested parties intersessionally, using WCPFC13-2016-33 as a basis. Australia and Fiji indicated they would work with USA on the guidelines. Fiji also suggested an additional paragraph that participants would need to be invited, and they would qualify for this invitation by having helped CCMs, as this signalled genuine interest. However, this was not taken up by the Commission."
WCPFC13,655,"The Commission recognized Article 21 of the WCPFC Convention, which provides for the Commission to promote transparency in its decision-making processes and other activities."
WCPFC13,656,"The Commission agreed that observers from non-governmental organizations will be required to pay a reasonable fee for participation at meetings of the Commission to contribute to the additional expenses generated by their participation, as determined annually by the Executive Director taking into account international practice."
WCPFC13,657,"The Commission agreed that the fee would be charged on registration and would be charged only for participation at Commission meetings, unless otherwise decided by the Commission."
WCPFC13,658,"The Commission agreed to develop and adopt intersessionally in time for use at TCC13 guidelines to enable the participation of NGO observers at closed meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies under conditions which would ensure the confidentiality and non-disclosure of any information learned as a result of that participation, and sanctions for failure to comply with the rules and procedures relating to participation. 15.3 Memoranda of Cooperation with CCSBT"
WCPFC13,659,"The Commission considered two proposed draft Memoranda of Cooperation (MoC) with the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), on: exchange and release of data; and endorsement of WCPFC ROP observers for observing transhipments of southern bluefin tuna on the high seas of the WCPFC Convention Area. The WCPFC Compliance Manager noted that both MoC had been endorsed by CCSBT and were tabled at TCC12, which supported them being forwarded to the Commission for consideration."
WCPFC13,660,"Japan requested that the square brackets around “at least” be removed from the draft conditions for the exchange of data. Subsequently, Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei supported the adoption of the MoC between the two RFMOs, citing their participation in CCSBT. Korea observed that the MoC could be mutually beneficial for both organisations as CCSBT moves towards quantifying all sources of mortality and as WCPFC moves towards harvest control rules."
WCPFC13,661,"FFA members supported the proposed MoC with CCSBT to exchange and release data, with the key requirement that WCPFC data is handled in accordance with the Commission’s data rules.  WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 93 of 361"
WCPFC13,662,"Regarding the MoC on endorsement of WCPFC ROP observers, FFA members noted that WCPFC ROP observers to be CCSBT-endorsed would need training on CCSBT data and information requirements and sought clarification about the related costs, and who would provide and pay for the training. FFA members and PNG, as an observer provider, which operates a cost recovery model, noted that with additional skills and responsibilities, remuneration for ROP observers would need to increase."
WCPFC13,663,The WCPFC Compliance Manager responded that there was no formal arrangement within the MoC for how training would occur and referred the Commission to paragraph 7 of the MoC. This provides for the Secretariats to assist in training WCPFC ROP observers to meet requirements for endorsement by the CCSBT. It was explained that if ROP observer providers wanted their observers to be endorsed they could signal that training assistance and/or support for other related costs was needed prior to opting in – CCBST-endorsement was not intended to be mandatory for all ROP observers involved in WCPFC transhipments and might be done on a needs basis.
WCPFC13,664,The Commission agreed that the Memorandum of Cooperation on the Exchange and Release of Data with CCSBT should be signed (Attachment X).
WCPFC13,665,The Commission agreed that the Memorandum of Cooperation on the Endorsement of WCPFC ROP Observers for Observing Transhipments of Southern Bluefin Tuna on the High Seas of the WCPFC Convention Area with CCSBT should be signed (Attachment Y). 15.4 Research projects 15.4.1 ABNJ Project
WCPFC13,666,A report prepared by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is available at WCPFC13-2016-37 and provided an update to the Commission on progress of the project Sustainable management of tuna fisheries and biodiversity conservation in the ABNJ. 15.4.2 WPEA Project
WCPFC13,667,"A report prepared by Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam and the Secretariat is available at WCPFC13-2016-36 and provided an update on the project Sustainable Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the West Pacific and East Asian Seas (WPEA project)."
WCPFC13,668,The Commission noted the updates on the ABNJ project (WCPFC13-2016-37) and WPEA project (WCPFC13-2016-36).  15.5 Election of officers
WCPFC13,669,"The Commission made a number of appointments to Commission positions: a. Rhea Moss-Christian (RMI) was appointed to continue as Commission Chair; b. Jung-re Kim (Korea) was appointed as the new Commission Vice-Chair; c. Berry Muller (RMI) was appointed to continue as SC Chair, and was thanked for taking on the role intersessionally and for chairing SC12; WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 94 of 361d. Masanori Miyahara (Japan) was appointed to continue as NC Chair; e. Michael Tosatto (USA) was appointed to continue as NC Vice-Chair; f. Alexa Cole (USA) was appointed to continue as TCC Chair;  g. Monte Depaune (Nauru) was appointed as the new TCC Vice-Chair;  h. Magele Eteuati Ropeti (Samoa) was appointed the new FAC Co-Chair on the first day of WCPFC13 to ensure the continuation of the co-chairing arrangement and the efficient progression of FAC work in the margins of the meeting.   15.6 Future meetings"
WCPFC13,670,"The Commission agreed that:  - SC13 would be held from 9-17 August 2017 in Rarotonga, Cook Islands; - NC13 would be held from 28 August – 1 September 2017 in Korea, with the venue to be confirmed; - TCC13 would be held from 27 September – 3 October 2017 in Pohnpei, FSM; - WCPFC14 would be held from 4-8 December 2017 in the Philippines, with the venue to be confirmed; - FAC11 would be held immediately prior to WCPFC14. AGENDA ITEM 16 — OTHER MATTERS"
WCPFC13,671,"On 8 December, the Chair announced that UNGA had announced that 2 May is World Tuna Day and noted PNA efforts to have this established."
WCPFC13,672,"RMI flagged that it would be raising the issue of marine debris and pollution at future meetings, with a draft measure to be submitted to WCPFC14 through SC13 and TCC13. EU thanked RMI for continuing to push marine debris and pollution work. This CCM considered these issues to be central components of ocean governance to be addressed as a priority."
WCPFC13,673,The Commission noted RMIs intention to progress a proposal for a WCPFC response related to addressing the issue of marine debris. AGENDA ITEM 17 — SUMMARY REPORT OF THE WCPFC13
WCPFC13,674,"The Secretariat advised that a final draft of the WCPFC13 Outcomes Document (WCPFC13-2016-outcomes) containing the decisions taken at WCPFC13 would be available on the Commission website within two weeks. The Commission would clear the meeting Summary Report intersessionally, as per past practice. WCPFC13 Summary Report (Issued 02-Mar-17) 95 of 361AGENDA ITEM 18 — CLOSE OF MEETING"
WCPFC13,675,"The Chair thanked the government of the Republic of Fiji for the meeting arrangements and thanked the Fijian Minister for Fisheries for his indulgence and hospitality for delaying the closing dinner to enable the Commission to finish its work. The Chair observed that it had been a successful meeting. The level of commitment was very high. This was especially evident in the drafting and working groups, some of which went late into the night. The Chair recalled that she had asked delegations to consider the value of incremental steps – these small steps remain critical to achieving the Commission’s objectives. The Chair thanked members and delegates for their cooperation, noting that through the outcomes of WCPFC13 the Commission had tasked itself with future work to continue strengthening WCPFC’s systems and Conservation and Management Measures. The Chair thanked the excellent job the Secretariat staff had done during an intense and high pressure meeting, and the rapporteur, Dr Jane Broweleit, for preparing the meeting reports that were the Commission’s ‘memory’."
WCPFC13,676,The meeting closed at 8:30 pm on Friday 9 December 2016.

He outlined the Philippines government initiatives and developments to protect and ensure the long-term conservation and management of its fisheries resources including from inland, inshore and offshore. They include implementation of a national shark management plan including declaration of whale shark as a protected species; continual improvements of national tuna stock assessment; catch documentation traceability scheme; enhanced monitoring, control and surveillance tools including a national vessel monitoring scheme and a national observer programme that provide for 100% coverage for purse seiners operating in the HSP1; the Philippine RICE initiative; and the Clean and Abundance Seas initiative that provide for substantial monetary awards to local governments that maintain the cleanest and well managed coastline and marine resources. The Secretary reaffirmed the Philippines commitment to observe and implement fully the Commission’s conservation and management measures and the fight against IUU fishing. Although he will not remain for the rest of the meeting because of his commitment at an international trade negotiation meeting the Philippines delegation looked forward to hearing and exchanging best practices in the Commission’s efforts to conserve and effectively manage tuna and highly migratory fish stocks of the WCPO. He concluded his address by wishing delegates success and enjoyable stay and a greeting of “may the fish be with you”."
WCPFC14,10,"The Commission Chair, Ms Rhea Moss-Christian, in her opening remarks spoke of the need for delegates to be mindful of the kind of legacy they would pass on to future generations as a consequence of the actions they take. As current custodian of tuna management delegates must accept the responsibility to develop outcomes that do more than address the immediate challenges. To accept short-term solutions is to abrogate the responsibility of a responsible custodian. She emphasized the consensus nature of the Commission and reminded that consensus means general agreement as a basis that all can live with, it does not mean that some members get all of what they want and others get just a little. So, the need to accept that the outcomes of the Commission must be a result of compromises as the Commission Convention dictates that only through collective efforts will there be collective gains. The Chair also provided a brief outline of the ongoing key issues that were carried over from the last meeting including harvest strategy, the compliance monitoring scheme, bycatch species, the tropical tuna measure and the south Pacific albacore tuna. The full statement of the Chair is in Attachment B."
WCPFC14,11,"The WCPFC Executive Director, Feleti P Teo, OBE, thanked Secretary Pinol for his presence and address and sharing some insightful perspectives that will surely provide inspiration to the deliberations of the Commission.  He noted that the Commission had a busy year, in addition to the annual sessions of its subsidiary bodies, the Commission also convened three intersessional sessions to progress the development and negotiations of two major tuna measures one for the tropical tunas (bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin) and the other for the South Pacific albacore. These had been difficult negotiations because of the multifaceted character of the fisheries and because of the divergent and entrenched positions of stakeholders in respect of those fisheries.  He recalled that the Commission had been able to reach agreement on equally difficult issues in the past, and hoped that the Commission would again rise to the occasion and again make the hard decisions needed mindful of the long-term sustainability 9 of the fisheries.  In noting the initiation of the independent review of the compliance monitoring scheme, he mentioned the sizable volume of work for the Secretariat and the Technical Compliance Committee generated by the compliance monitoring scheme and hoped that the review would find recommendations to streamline the operation of the scheme and make it more efficient and effective mindful of the capacity and resources limitations of the Commission and the Secretariat. The full text of the Executive Director’s statement is in Attachment C. 1.1 Adoption of agenda"
WCPFC14,12,"After a brief discussion of the agenda (WCPFC14-2017-01_rev1), it was agreed that the USA would present its paper on membership process under agenda item 3.4."
WCPFC14,13,The agenda was adopted as amended (Attachment D).  1.2 Statements from Members and Participating Territories
WCPFC14,14,The Chair invited Members and Participating Territories who wish to make opening statements to do so and encouraged those with written statements to provide copies to the Secretariat.
WCPFC14,15,"The Republic of Korea thanked the Secretariat for the arrangements for the meeting and the host country for the magnificent hospitality. He acknowledged that fisheries resources are limited and stressed importance of ensuring their sustainability in accordance with the principles of the Commission Convention. He mentioned that the challenge of negotiating a new tropical tuna measure and emphasised the need for the process to be fair, transparent and ensure no member is left unheard, and pledged Korea’s commitment to participate constructively in the negotiations."
WCPFC14,16,"Hon. Tetabo Nakara, Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources Development of Kiribati reminded the Commission of the unique geographical configuration of Kiribati marine zones as recognized by the Commission in Article 10 (3) (i) of the Convention and the particular challenges it encountered.  He observed that Kiribati categorically recognised the high seas pockets as part of their planned fishing areas. Kiribati’s non-contiguous EEZ was the country’s only viable source of economic survival and stability, and access fees from tuna fishing contributed more than 80% toward the total Government’s annual expenditure.  He noted that the small tuna processing plant established on Tarawa, which was an important employment provider would struggle to retain its economic viability if domestic fishing vessels were further restricted from fishing on FADS for twelve months over and above the current three months closure, or if they were deprived of fishing tuna in the adjacent high seas.  Tuna was of paramount importance for the viability of Kiribati’s sustainable development for current and future generations. In safeguarding this valuable resource, Kiribati had unanimously closed off 11% of its combined EEZ area, known as the Phoenix Island Protected Area. Recent research indicated that this area has become an important spawning ground sanctuary for tuna and other marine resources.  Kiribati reminded developed nations members of the Commission of their obligations under several international fisheries conventions including the WCPFC convention to recognise and support the special requirements of Small Islands Developing States."
WCPFC14,17,"Hon. Semi Koroilavesau, Minister for Fisheries of Fiji emphasised the importance of working collaboratively towards achieving consensus on measures that will sustainably managed the highly migratory tuna stocks and other species of WCPO. He highlighted the issue of observer safety and recalled the intense discussions in the 2016 meeting and the important role observer play in the provision of information and data that enable managers understood better the status of resources before agreeing to appropriate measures, and a source of employment for many countries in the Pacific. He also supported the need to adequately address the issue of disproportionate burden mindful of the distinct and diverse economic, social and political situations and capacities of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Fiji stressed the importance of “catch certification” which has become a formidable tool 10 to combat IUU fishing and provided an economic opportunity for domestic fleet to access niche markets with value added products at a premium rate. There had been ongoing collaborations between relevant stakeholders and the government to ensure the certification process is transparent to ensure those that were certified are in full compliance with the conditions of their certification. Fiji is supportive of the work on the harvest strategy work plan and harvest strategy a key component of the certification regime. Minister registered his concern on the slow progress on agreeing on tighter controls on fishing efforts in the high seas."
WCPFC14,18,"Hon. Lopaoo Natanielu Mu’a, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries of Samoa acknowledged the significance of the tuna and highly migratory fish stocks in WCPO and its contribution to the economic development, food security and livelihood of Pacific communities and thus critical to ensure its biological and economic sustainability. He noted that Samoa has just hosted the annual Pacific Forum Leaders meeting with the theme “the Blue Pacific - our sea of islands, our security through sustainable development, management and conservation” which augurs well with the work of the Commission and regionalism generally. The Minister referenced the Forum Regional Roadmap for Sustainable Fisheries as the key regional strategy guiding collaborative efforts to achieve sustainable fisheries for the Pacific and Samoa is committed to make its contribution. Of specific interest to Samoa are the economic viability of its domestic longline fleet; biological and economic sustainability of the South Pacific albacore stock; its capacity development needs to participate effectively in the fisheries; and ensuring effective monitoring, control and surveillance capabilities."
WCPFC14,19,"Hon. Patrick Basa, Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources of Papua New Guinea (PNG), urged all Commission Members to respect and uphold the spirit of the Convention in their deliberations. He reiterated PNG’s commitment to continue to work with others to maintain the robust decision-making processes of the Commission to reach consensus decisions supported by all, to sustainably manage and conserve the highly migratory fish stocks in the region.  He reminded the Commission of the need to respect the development aspirations of small islands developing states and their sovereign rights to manage resources in their EEZs including archipelagic waters. He maintained that the Commission’s primary responsibility is to adopt management measures for the high seas which are compatible with measures in adjacent EEZs. As a PNA member PNG is committed to working with other PNA members to enhance the efficiency of the VDS as a management tool. The Minister also raised the need to carefully address the issue of disproportionate burden; that conservation and management measures must address sustainability and security; and reiterated the Pacific Leaders’ direction in favour of zone-based measures."
WCPFC14,20,"Hon. Alfred Alfred, Jr., Minister of Natural Resources and Commerce of the Marshall Islands (RMI), expressed concern that Commission processes and conservation and management measures adopted were often at times burdensome and generated adverse and often costly consequences for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). He recalled that the RMI led and actively participated in the negotiations leading to the unanimous adoption of CMM 2013-06 and CMM 2013-07 which were premised upon Article 30 of the Convention which safeguards the special requirements of SIDS which includes but is not limited to development aspirations. The RMI continued to be concerned with several proposals tabled by developed CCMs with little to no direct consultations with SIDS on their potential adverse impacts on their people and livelihood. The Minister highlighted the critical importance of effectively operationalize the Tropical Tuna Bridging Measure. He also mentioned other issues of particular interests including stock health, effective control of the high seas around RMI, safety of observers and marine pollution."
WCPFC14,21,"Niue regarded sustainable management of the ocean as a development priority under its National Strategic Development Framework as it provided for food and economic development.  Niue is implementing zone-based approaches to managing its EEZ and like other FFA members strongly support a zone-based approach to managing the tuna fisheries across the region. Niue looked forward to negotiating fair and equitable arrangements for the conservation and allocation of the high seas 11 fisheries and strongly support the proposal that the Commission commence a process to establish and allocate high seas limits (for both the purse seine and longline fisheries), a process based upon the allocation considerations set out in the Convention in Articles 10 (3) and 30, which recognise the special circumstances and needs of SIDS."
WCPFC14,22,"Indonesia confirmed its commitment to implement the conservation and management measures of the Commission as evident by the significant improvement in the level of Indonesia’s compliance in recent years. Indonesia has taken actions under its National Plan of Action to Prevent and Combat IUU Fishing (2012). Indonesia made efforts to be compatible with CMM 2016-01 on the Conservation and Management Measures for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna in the WCPO. It hoped that the new measure will ensure the sustainability of tropical tuna resources and an opportunity to re-develop its fisheries after a great reduction of fishing effort through moratorium and ensuring the livelihood of small scale fishers and communities reliant on such fisheries. Indonesia has commenced to develop Harvest Strategy Framework for Indonesia’s tuna archipelagic waters since 2014 consistent with the objectives of the commission for the sustainability of tuna resources."
WCPFC14,23,"New Caledonia informed the meeting that despite Vietnam’s statement at TCC14 concerning their efforts to address concerns about the operations of the ‘blue boats’ in the Pacific, the blue boats are back in the Pacific as evident by two blue boats seized recently in New Caledonia’s waters. This was also despite the efforts of FFA and the Quadrilateral Partners (Australia, France, New Zealand and the United States) and the European Union in issuing a yellow card for Vietnam. New Caledonia acknowledged with appreciation the efforts of Australia in collaboration with the French navy in the recent seizures."
WCPFC14,24,American Samoa explained the link between the outcomes of the Commission and its economy that depend critically on the economic viability of the large tuna processing plants located in American Samoa. The benefits of locating in American Samoa have recently been eroded forcing those processing plants to close down and scale down operations resulting in adverse and drastic impacts on its economy and loss of employment opportunities for American Samoa and neighbouring Pacific countries. American Samoa acknowledged that it carried a demonstrable and quantifiable disproportionate burden of the measures of the Commission and intends to seek redress in the new tropical tuna measure currently under negotiation.
WCPFC14,25,Philippines reiterated its welcome to delegates to the meeting and to the Philippines. It reconfirmed its commitment to the principles of sustainable management and combatting IUU fishing and that their domestic laws encapsulate those objectives. Philippines acknowledged that its compliance with CMMs of the Commission is a work in progress and they are committed to improve. Philippines noted its access to “High Seas Pocket 1” was vital to its economic and social development and wished to preserve and improve it under the new tropical tuna measure as a distinct management measure rather than an exemption. Philippines tuna fisheries is heavily FAD dependent and any further FAD closure should be carefully considered.
WCPFC14,26,Guam supported the statement by the American Samoa delegation in recognition of their economic dependence on the region’s tuna fisheries.  Guam noted that historically Guam was a homeport for purse seine vessels and for several decades an important longline offloading port. It expressed hope for continued cooperation in the conservation and management of the region’s tuna fishery.
WCPFC14,27," Solomon Islands confirmed its commitment to sustainable fisheries management and to engage constructively in the work of the Commission. It identified key issues of interest on the agenda to include the tropical tuna measure discussions, harvest strategy work plan, and reforms to the compliance monitoring scheme.  12"
WCPFC14,28,"The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands also supported the statement of American Samoa in recognition of their economic dependence on the region’s tuna fisheries, noting that current and future food security considerations associated with tuna resources was also an important issue for CNMI."
WCPFC14,29,"Vietnam, a cooperating non-member, reiterated its commitment to address the situation of ‘blue boat’ as mentioned by New Caledonia and to combat IUU fishing activities. It has recently revised its domestic law to impose heavier penalties for Vietnam flagged vessels caught fishing illegally in other EEZs. 1.3 Meeting arrangements"
WCPFC14,30,"The Commission considered the meeting arrangements and indicative meeting schedule, including planned social functions and proposed side events by ISSF, ABNJ Common Oceans Tuna Project, and SPREP. Decisions reached at the Heads of Delegation meeting held the previous day were confirmed.  1.3.1 Establishment of small working groups (CNMs, CMS, Others)"
WCPFC14,31,"The Commission considered the need for small working groups to be established, including the corresponding schedule and working arrangements."
WCPFC14,32,The following informal small working groups (SWGs) were established at the start of the meeting to further consider these issues and to provide a report for consideration by plenary:  • Finalisation of the provisional Compliance Monitoring Report (pCMR) (led by TCC Chair); • Consideration of participatory rights for Cooperating Non-Members (led by Canada); and • Draft Bridging Measure on Tropical Tuna (led by the Chair).
WCPFC14,33,The Chair explained the draft Indicative Schedule (WCPFC14-2017-02_rev1) noting that based on the proposals submitted for consideration at this meeting additional working groups may be needed.  It was agreed that consideration would be given to the establishment of additional working groups as the meeting progressed and where deemed necessary.
WCPFC14,34,"The following additional informal SWGs were subsequently established during the course of the meeting:  • South Pacific albacore proposals for a draft measure and a target reference point (led by New Zealand); • Prevention of Marine Pollution proposal (led by Republic of Marshall Islands); • Port State measures proposal (led by New Zealand); • Development of Terms of Reference for a Comprehensive Sharks and Ray Measure (led by Japan); and • Seabirds (led by New Zealand).  In addition, a number of other proposals and draft text were progressed through the proponents leading informal discussions and holding consultations with interested CCMs in the margins of the meeting.    13 1.3.2 Election of FAC co-chair"
WCPFC14,35,"The Commission extended its thanks to former FAC co-chair, Dr Paul Callaghan (USA) for his services.  It was noted that FAC would continue to meet in the margins of WCPFC14, and that a second co-chair was needed."
WCPFC14,36,The Commission appointed Mr Wataru Tanoue (Japan) to be FAC co-chair.
WCPFC14,37,"Mr Tanoue’s duties began immediately, to assist FAC11 to progress its work throughout the course of the meeting. AGENDA ITEM 2 – REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR"
WCPFC14,38,"The Executive Director, as required by rule 13 of the Rules of Procedures of the Commission, presented his Annual Report (WCPFC14-2017-04), highlighting the main work programmes and activities of the Commission and its Secretariat for 2017. He noted that 2017 was a busy year with three intersessional sessions of the Commission convened to progress the negotiations of CMMs for tropical tuna and South Pacific albacore. The Executive Director acknowledged with appreciation the monetary contribution by ABNJ (Common Oceans) Tuna Project and the USA for providing the meeting venue for one of the intersessional meetings to progress the draft bridging measure on tropical tuna and to New Zealand for the monetary contribution for intersessional meeting to progress the draft bridging measure for the south Pacific albacore. The said meetings were in addition to the annual meetings of the SC13, NC13, and TCC13 which were all held successfully and their summary reports published. The Executive Director thanked the officials that presided over the work of those subsidiary body meeting, namely; Ms Berry Muller (RMI) and Mr Aisake Batibasaga (Fiji) as Chair and Vice-Chair respectively for SC13, Mr Masanori Miyahara (Japan) and Mr Mike Tosatto (USA) as Chair and Vice-Chair of NC13, Ms Alexa Cole (USA) and Mr Monte Depaune (Nauru) as Chair and Vice-Chair for TCC13, and Dr Paul Callaghan (USA) and Mr Magele Etuati Ropeti as Co-Chairs for FAC10. The Executive Director reported that the financial affairs of the Commission for the financial 2016 were in order with the Audit Report of the 2016 accounts and financial statements were audited to be in compliance with the Commission financial regulations. The Executive Director registered the gratitude of the Commission to all the members and partner agencies who provided voluntary contributions to support the work programme of the Commission. The Commission continued to benefit in 2017 from the quality services of its services providers namely SPC-OFP as the science and data services provider, ISC as science services provider for the NC, and FFA as the VMS services provider. The Commission Chair signed two memoranda of cooperation with the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) on cross-endorsement of ROP observers and exchange and release of data. The Executive Director continued his collaborations with other organisations through attendance at meetings of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), Parties to the Nauru Agreement, Forum Fisheries Agency, Pacific Islands Forum, and FAO through the ABNJ project. It was noted that the Commission was successfully managing two major projects – the bycatch component of the ABNJ Common Oceans project, and the West Pacific East Asia (WPEA) Project. The Executive Director advised that the technical coordinator for the ABNJ bycatch component Dr Shelley Clarke will be relocated away from Pohnpei in 2018 but was assured that Dr Clarke would continue to provide the services to WCPFC that she had in the past from her new location."
WCPFC14,39,The European Union thanked the Executive Director for the extensive report which demonstrated the wealth of activities of the organisation which continue to grow. European Union welcomed and encouraged cooperation with other RFMO especially IATTC and it regretted that the WCPFC didn’t participate at the work of the joint tuna RFMO Working Group on FAD. European Union thanked Dr Shelley Clarke for the quality services rendered and wished to be assured that the shark project funded 14 by the European Union will not be jeopardised by her relocation which the Executive Director confirmed.
WCPFC14,40,The Republic of Korea thanked the Executive Director for the report and acknowledged progress achieved in the age and growth project and thanked SPC-OFP for their services. Korea thanked the Secretariat for coordinating efforts to progress negotiations of the bridging measure for tropical tuna and for the documentation for the meeting.
WCPFC14,41,"Cook Islands on behalf of FFA thanked the Executive Director for the Report. FFA maintained the importance of the Secretariat developing a Corporate Plan that aligns the budget and the work plans and priorities of the Commission. The Commission should make concerted efforts to prioritise its work so it can streamline and rationalise its number of meetings. The need for intersessional sessions should not be used as a precedent for moving away from the original requirement of discussing all the substantive business of the Commission within two sessions mindful of the limitations of SIDS. FFA encouraged the use of virtual working groups and supported ongoing collaborations between WCPFC and IATTC to ensure that WCPFC has complete involvement in the process of rebuilding the Pacific bluefin stock, and in the monitoring and management of the IATTC/WCPFC high seas overlap area."
WCPFC14,42,Indonesia thanked the Secretariat for its continued support to the WPEA project and hoped that the New Zealand funded activities of the WPEA will get off to a good start. Indonesia also queried the vacancies in support staff positions.
WCPFC14,43,"The Executive Director, responding to Indonesia’s query, explained that both vacancies are part of the compliance team and arose out of staff resignations. The terms of reference for those positions were being reviewed as part of efforts to reform them before they are filled."
WCPFC14,44,The Commission accepted the 2017 Annual Report of the Executive Director (WCPFC14-2017-04).  AGENDA ITEM 3 – MEMBERSHIP AND OTHER APPLICATIONS 3.1 Status of the Convention
WCPFC14,45,"New Zealand, as depositary of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, presented WCPFC14-2017-05 Status of the Convention. It advised that since its last report in December 2016, New Zealand had not received notification of any instruments of ratification or accession to the Convention."
WCPFC14,46,The Commission noted the report on Status of the Convention (WCPFC14-2017-05) 3.2 Update on observer status
WCPFC14,47,The Executive Director referred the meeting to WCPFC14-2017-06 List of Observers that provided the full list of observer delegations.  It was confirmed that that since WCPFC13 two new observers had been invited intersessionally to participate in this session of the Commission namely Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources and Security (ANCORS) and Ocean Outcomes (O2).
WCPFC14,48,The Commission noted the updated list of observers to the Commission (WCPFC14-2017-06) 15 3.3 Applications for Cooperating Non-Member status
WCPFC14,49,"The Commission considered applications for Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) status for 2018 in accordance with CMM 2009-11, including recommendations from the 13th Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC13). As outlined in paper WCPFC14-2017-07 Cooperating Non-Member requests, there were seven applications for CNM status in 2018 from Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam."
WCPFC14,50,"Samoa, on behalf of FFA Members, noted that the renewal of CNM status was conditional upon full compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, and all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention. FFA Members requested information on what steps CNMs have taken towards addressing any compliance issues noted in this year’s provisional Compliance Monitoring Report."
WCPFC14,51,"FSM, on behalf of FFA Members, noted Vietnam’s increased acknowledgement and international engagement on addressing illegal fishing by small-scale fishing vessels originating from their jurisdiction. The issue of blue boat incursions posed a serious and ongoing threat to many coastal CCM’s fisheries, livelihoods and sovereignty. FFA Members noted the Vietnamese Prime Minister’s official directive issued in May this year dealing with this issue. In light of the recent comments made by New Caledonia regarding incursions in their zone, FFA Members requested an update from Vietnam on the status of implementation of the range of domestic actions outlined in the official directive. Information was sought on the efforts that had been taken by Vietnam to: i) develop national policies to address IUU fishing; ii) Enhance monitoring and control and surveillance of domestic fishing vessels; and iii). Enhance interagency cooperation in the conduct of MCS activities."
WCPFC14,52,"The Chair noted the normal process was that the Commission accept the applications then the SWG considers the associated participatory rights of those CNMs for the next year.  Based on the comments expressed, there were some outstanding issues that would need to be resolved before the Commission could take a decision on accepting the seven CNM applications."
WCPFC14,53,"Some CCMs indicated a preference to resume discussions after the informal SWG on the provisional Compliance Monitoring Report has the chance to complete its work, particularly to review any relevant new information submitted by CNM applicants. Accordingly, further discussion of applications was deferred."
WCPFC14,54,"After further consideration of compliance information submitted by the applying CNMs, the Commission agreed to accept the applications for renewal of CNM status in 2018 of Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Panama and Thailand. Members deferred consideration of requests from Vietnam and Mexico until additional information could be provided by those applicants."
WCPFC14,55,"In respect of Vietnam’s request, some CCMs reiterated their concerns about the “blue boats” issue and requested a response from Vietnam.  Vietnam’s outstanding financial contribution for 2017 was also highlighted to be problematic.  In respect of Mexico’s request, it was recognised that Mexico had not sent delegates to WCPFC14 and questions remained about its commitment to accept high seas boarding and inspection in the Convention Area."
WCPFC14,56,In the margins of the meeting Vietnam completed payment of its final contribution for 2017 and the Secretariat was able to confirm receipt of the contributions. Vietnam also gave assurances to the Commission about its 2018 contribution.
WCPFC14,57,In the course of the WCPFC14 meeting Mexico submitted two letters to the Secretariat in response to the Commission’s questions (WCPFC14-2017-OP016 and WCPFC14-2017-OP016_suppl).   16
WCPFC14,58," The report of the informal SWG considering the CNM participatory rights made the following recommendations: • The SWG noted with appreciation the attendance and participation of Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Panama, Thailand, and Vietnam in the Group’s discussions. Mexico was not able to attend but did write during the meeting to confirm their interest and commitment of payment for 2017.  • Some of the attending CCMs stated their acceptance of CNM applications was conditional on the receipt of financial contributions.  Other CCMs noted their interpretation that voluntary contributions were expected, and that they suggested that decisions on CNM applications take into account a range of factors based on the relevant CMM.  • CCMs noted the importance that CNMs meet reporting requirements and deadlines, and that a lack of full and timely reporting in future years could affect decisions on CNM applications or membership. • It was confirmed that applications were complete and outstanding data addressed for the seven applicants. • Participants noted that they felt that the discussion and decision on Vietnam’s request for CNM status be considered in plenary.  Some CCMs noted concern over the activity of “blue boats” in the Convention Area. Vietnam noted the measures they have taken to update their legislation including penalties and committed to there being no further instances in 2018 or they would not seek CNM status for 2019. Some CCMs noted their appreciation of the actions that Vietnam has taken and indicated they were actively working with Vietnam to address the situation. • Participants noted that they felt that the discussion and decision on Mexico’s request for CNM status be considered in plenary.  Some CCMs noted concern over the lack of commitment to apply the WCPFC HSBI scheme.  Others noted the interest in having Mexico’s ongoing engagement as they fish shared stocks in IATTC, have not had a fishing vessel active in the Convention Area, and that they understand that there are domestic constraints on applying measures where there is no treaty obligation.   • The SWG agreed to recommend that the CNMs accepted by the WCPFC plenary (i.e. Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam) have the same participatory rights in 2018 as they had in 2017."
WCPFC14,59,"WCPFC14 approved the applications for CNM status for 2018 from Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam.   3.3.1 Participatory rights of CNMs"
WCPFC14,60,"WCPFC14 agreed to the following limits to be applied to the participatory rights of CNMs (Convention / CMM 2009-11): a. In accordance with the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following participatory rights apply to Cooperating Non- Members (CNMs) for fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area; b. In addition, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under their national jurisdiction or other CCMs’ national jurisdiction, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements; 17 c. CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPFC Convention and the WCPFC conservation and management measures. In addition, CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV); d. CCMs shall ensure that CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention; and e. Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will take into account compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, and all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPFC Convention. CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the Secretariat for attention by TCC. Participatory rights of each CNM in 2018"
WCPFC14,61,"Ecuador: The participatory rights of Ecuador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2016-01 or its replacement measure."
WCPFC14,62,El Salvador: The participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. The total level of effort by purse seine vessels of El Salvador on the high seas shall not exceed 29 days in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2016-01 or its replacement measure.
WCPFC14,63,"Liberia: The participatory rights of Liberia are limited to reefer vessels to engage in transhipment activities, and bunker and supply vessels to support fishing vessels in the Convention area."
WCPFC14,64,"Mexico: It was noted that Mexico had participated in the work of the Northern Committee (NC) at NC 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 and, noting the need for cooperation with the work of the NC particularly in regard to Pacific bluefin tuna, encouraged Mexico to continue to participate in the NC. Mexico does not intend to have a vessel presence in 2018. Any future introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2016-01 or its replacement measure. Their letter notes their commitment to comply with the legal provisions and obligations as a CNM."
WCPFC14,65,"Panama: The participatory rights of Panama in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels. Panama’s participatory rights also apply to vessels that supply food, water and spare parts to carrier vessels that engage in transhipment activities, provided that these vessels do not engage in activities supporting fishing vessels, including providing and/or servicing FADs. The SWG also noted that this does not result in any additional participatory rights in 2018 to the participatory rights granted to Panama in 2017."
WCPFC14,66,Thailand: The participatory rights of Thailand in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only. 18
WCPFC14,67,Vietnam: The participatory rights of Vietnam in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.  WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area

WCPFC14,69,"In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area."
WCPFC14,70,"For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with international and domestic laws, vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area. Implementation of changes to the CNM request template"
WCPFC14,71,As agreed at WCPFC13 a column was included in the CNM application template where a CNM applicant could indicate their interest in becoming a member of the Commission. 3.4 Membership Process in WCPFC
WCPFC14,72,"The United States introduced a Discussion paper on Membership Process in WCPFC (WCPFC14-2017-DP18), which aimed to build on previous years discussions on whether the WCPFC membership should be allowed to grow and what criteria or processes could be used when considering new members. The United States was of the view that WCPFC should extend to other countries the courtesy of considering their interest in joining the organisation, as they assessed WCPFC as standing apart from other Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMOs) as it appeared to be less open to new members and did not have a clear process for inviting new members to join the organisation. The paper was also noted to include some membership precedents from other RFMOs."
WCPFC14,73,"Palau, on behalf of FFA Members, acknowledged the requests for membership and thanked the CNMs for their interest and thanked the USA for their paper. FFA Members reiterated statements made at previous meetings, in particular that this Commission was unique compared to other RFMOs. The majority of members were small island developing States (SIDS) that were overwhelmingly dependent on fisheries resources and the majority of fishing takes place within their waters. FFA Members expressed that they did not think it appropriate to expect that what happened in other RFMOs would automatically apply in this region. Reiterating their view from the WCPFC13 meeting, they expressed that the Commission was not a “level playing field” for all Members, particularly for SIDS and this was a real concern for them in relation to considering potential new Members. FFA members also confirmed their view that the process in the Convention is sufficiently clear on the subject of new Members – by consensus and by invitation. FFA Members also expressed their firmly held view that CMM 2009-11 both considers the uniqueness of this RFMO and provides a mechanism for cooperation with non-parties. FFA Members encouraged CNMs to continue to cooperate with the Commission through the CNM request mechanism. 19"
WCPFC14,74,"Nauru stated that PNA members did not support the expansion of the Commission to include new members. PNA members have always considered WCPFC to be a closed Commission and that new members could only join by invitation and consensus as enshrined in the Convention. That process reflects the nature of this Commission where over 85% of the catch was made in the waters of developing countries, especially SIDS, who are highly dependent on those resources."
WCPFC14,75,"The European Union thanked the United States for their paper, as a balanced and representative overview of other RFMO membership processes. The European Union did not see how this RFMO was different in international law and that it should not be a closed organisation. The focus should be on determining the conditions of new membership in keeping with the Law of the Sea, the basis of the existence of this very organisation. It hoped this discussion could continue."
WCPFC14,76,"Chinese Taipei supported an RFMO process that was open to new membership applications. WCPFC did not need to be a closed RFMO in order to achieve its objectives. A number of the interested applicants were already members of other tuna RFMOs, and the Commission should at least consider their applications or at least consider developing process to consider applications for new members."
WCPFC14,77,"Papua New Guinea in support of Nauru’s intervention, reiterated that PNA members do not support the expansion of the Commission to include new Members. The current CNM process provides appropriate opportunities to CNMs for participation in WCPO fisheries and in the Commission processes."
WCPFC14,78,"Japan thanked the United States for their paper and agreed that this tuna RFMO was unique, however Members should at least start a discussion about new membership. Denying that discussion is inconsistent with Article 4 of the Convention, the Convention on the Law of the Sea and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement."
WCPFC14,79,"The Republic of Korea supported the Commission giving consideration to establishing the processes, as is proposed in the paper by the United States."
WCPFC14,80,"Palau further noted that 85% of the catch managed by this Commission are harvested in waters of developing countries.  This Commission was unique compared to other RFMOs, and this is also relevant to the consideration of new Members."
WCPFC14,81,"The Republic of the Marshall Islands acknowledged Article 4 of the Convention as being important to this discussion, however it expressed that due consideration should also be given to the requirement in the Convention for an invitation by consensus to be extended to new members. The Commission should also be mindful of Article 30, the special requirements of Small Island Developing States, CMM 2013-06 and the uniqueness of this Commission particularly given that the majority of catches are made within developing countries EEZs.  In this respect, the Commission needs to recognise that some of the current members have compliance issues.  The interests of SIDS need to be addressed before considering the issue of potential new members."
WCPFC14,82,"Samoa noted that there was not one solution to fit all RFMOs. The core responsibility of this Commission was the monitoring and compliance of WCPO fisheries resources. Rules had already been set in the Convention for the admission of new members. The doors to this Commission are not closed, the doors are open by invitation and consensus. The interests of SIDS are important to this issue, and indicated a preference of not changing the current arrangements."
WCPFC14,83,Tonga thanked the United States for its proposal and was respectful of those interested in WCPFC membership. It sought clarification on the intent and real interests behind the submission of this paper and of those fishing nations who had expressed an interest in becoming new members.   20
WCPFC14,84,"Canada expressed appreciation to the United States for its paper.  Canada supported an on-going membership discussion in the WCPFC. It acknowledged the UN Fish Stocks Agreement but also recognised the uniqueness of the WCPFC that clearly differentiated it from other RFMOs, in particular SIDS needs. It expressed that perhaps there was a gap in the paper duly considering the decision-making process of this forum in Article 20.  The views expressed by a number of small islands developing States need to be acknowledged and duly considered in future discussions on this matter."
WCPFC14,85,"Ecuador thanked the United States delegation for the presentation of this discussion paper.  Ecuador had been a WCPFC CNM for a number of years and had not received an answer to its request for full membership which made it feel discriminated against. WCPFC was the first RFMO established under the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. It understood that this organisation was unique, but expressed that not even wanting to talk about new membership contravened international law. Ecuador asked and encouraged WCPFC to develop a framework to welcome new members. If it could not be considered now it should be at least considered for the future."
WCPFC14,86,Panama thanked the United States for their paper. The question of which countries should be eligible warranted discussion. It repeated its interest in becoming a full member and asked that rules for invitation be developed by the WCPFC. Those interested in full membership were also developing countries with a similar understanding of SIDS needs.
WCPFC14,87,"The Chair thanked the United States for bringing the paper to the Commission and acknowledged that the paper had encouraged discussion on this matter. Based on the discussions, it is clear there currently is no consensus to consider developing a process for new membership beyond the existing CNM request process, and the membership invitation provisions in the Convention. The range of views expressed by Members during discussions was duly noted.  AGENDA ITEM 4 – NEW PROPOSALS"
WCPFC14,88,"CCMs with new proposals were invited to present them to the Commission. Proposals that addressed matters relevant to other agenda items were presented under those agenda items. In considering new proposals, the Commission was invited to consider how to progress discussions throughout the meeting and whether additional informal small working groups were required. 4.1 Implementation of CMM 2013-06"
WCPFC14,89,"The Republic of the Marshall Islands, on behalf of FFA Members, introduced WCPFC14-2017-DP11 Implementation of CMM 2013-06.  The paper presented FFA member views that reflected on the past three years since the adoption of CMM 2013-06 in Cairns, and surmised that the measure is yet to be fully implemented.  The intent of CMM 2013-06 was to assist the Commission in giving full recognition to the special requirements of Small Island Developing States and Territory CCMs as outlined in Article 30 of the Convention.  CMM 2013-06 sought to provide a mechanism to operationalise the implementation of Article 30, through providing a list of basic criteria against which all CMMs should be assessed to ensure that those special requirements are taken into account by the Commission and that disproportionate burden is duly addressed.  Over the period most non-FFA CCMs did make some attempt to address the requirements of CMM 2013-06 by providing responses to the CMM 2013-06 appraisal criteria when tabling proposals, but there remain a few instances where CMM proposals had been tabled without the appraisal criteria having been completed.  The few instances when CCMs have travelled to consult directly with FFA Members during their process of developing responses to CMM 2013-06 criteria were recognised.  All CCMs were urged to actively consult with FFA members in the developing of responses to the criteria in CMM 2013-06, so to ensure smoother passage of future proposals across the floor of the Commission.  FFA Members reiterated that they will seriously consider rejecting any proposal that does not make an honest attempt to address CMM 2013-21 06 requirements.  The Marshall Islands urged that the consultation process with SIDS on the CMM 2013-06 checklist was an extremely important part of the development and consideration of new proposals in the Commission, and in particular in addressing disproportionate burden."
WCPFC14,90,"Japan expressed regret if some CCMs felt that all CMM 2013-06 criteria had not been adequately addressed in any of its proposals to the Commission to date. However, it made the point that it was necessary to recognise that the degree of application of CMM 2013-06 does vary depending on the content of a proposal. Secondly, Japan had made efforts to have prior consultation with FFA Members, including on the tropical tuna measure. However, such consultation might not always be possible, and suggested that perhaps the agreement by the Commission to submit a proposal one month before the annual meeting nonetheless provided opportunity for the CMM 2013-06 checklist to be adequately considered and for the necessary consultations to take place, where needed."
WCPFC14,91,"Republic of Korea stated that their interpretation was that CMM 2013-06 does not require the proponent of a new proposal to have prior consultation with SIDS members in advance of submitting its proposal to the annual session. It was not appropriate for the lack of consultation prior to the meeting to mean any new proposals at this meeting could not be considered. In referring to CMM 2013-06, Korea noted that it was the Commission who is required to consider the eight questions to evaluate the nature and extent of impact of a proposal on SIDS and Territories. So, it is the Commission that should undertake the assessment and can consider proponents’ submissions against the criteria in CMM 2013-06.  It was also noted that CMM 2013-06 paragraph 4 refers to a process that where transfer of disproportionate burden has occurred, the Commission must undertake an analysis to consider who is impacted and ways to mitigate that burden. To date such an analysis has not been presented to the Commission."
WCPFC14,92,"China noted that according to the Convention this Commission should take into consideration the special requirements of developing States. While recognising that special consideration should be given to those States when the Commission adopts CMMs, China had some concerns about the ideas expressed in the paper. All Members of the Commission have equal obligations and equal rights, so even though it was important to be aware of the requirement, the implementation of this measure equally applies the requirements of all CMMs. This was the best way for common objectives and common goals to be met."
WCPFC14,93,"The United States thanked FFA Members for the paper and recognised the importance to those CCMs of improved implementation of CMM 2013-06. The United States indicated that they would further consider this matter over the next year and undertook to make efforts to improve consultation with FFA on any relevant proposals in 2018.  The United States confirmed it shared the interpretation that CMM 2013-06 does not specifically call for consultation. However, if there was to be a requirement for consultation in the context of CMM 2013-06, it asks that such consultation extends to the United States and its participating territories in respect of relevant proposals."
WCPFC14,94,"Chinese Taipei confirmed that it also shared the interpretation that CMM 2013-06 does not require prior consultation.  The process set out in paragraph 4 of CMM 2013-06 provides the opportunity for a CCM to express their views at the Commission annual session, if they thought the proposal would impose a disproportionate burden on that CCM or group of CCMs. The proponent of the proposal in hearing those views may then choose to modify their proposal to take on board those views.  The suggestion to have a requirement to have a prior consultation with SIDS was not supported."
WCPFC14,95,"The European Union thanked the FFA Members for the paper and confirmed that the checklist and the requirements of CMM 2013-06 were recognised as important matters. Consultation with all relevant Members was something that all CCMs should strive to do, but sometimes it was not easy to achieve, prior to the meeting, though consultation was possible during the annual meeting.  It indicated that sometimes disproportionate burden can be addressed elsewhere for example through development 22 assistance programmes, and does not necessarily need to be in-built within each measure.  It was concerned that the effect of the paper may be to limit the ability of non-SIDS members to table proposals.  The European Union undertook to strive to comply with all requirements in CMM 2013-06 and they confirmed that the requirements are not taken lightly."
WCPFC14,96,"The Republic of Marshall Islands reiterated that the development of the proposal that subsequently became CMM 2013-06 was intended to provide a mechanism to assist the Commission with implementing Article 30.  If a proponent intends for a proposal to be adopted by the Commission, consultation with all relevant CCMs would be a prerequisite to achieving consensus.  It follows that if SIDS are expected to implement or be impacted by a proposal then they must be consulted, both to assist them with understanding the proposal and to provide them time to consider any disproportionate burden or implementation constraints that could arise from the proposals requirements.  CCMs were urged to implement CMM 2013-06 though undertaking consultations with FFA members in advance of tabling of all new proposals.  Japan’s efforts to undertake mutual consultations with FFA members over a number of years were acknowledged to have worked well."
WCPFC14,97,"The Federated States of Micronesia noted that perhaps there have been CMMs that were adopted in the Commission without all CCMs fully understanding the impact of what the measures could have on SIDS. The checklist of questions in CMM 2013-06 was intended to streamline the work of the Commission in implementing Article 30, and sought to provide some checks that avoided SIDS getting into a non-compliant situation because they did not fully understand new programmes or processes and the implementation burden that they simply did not have the capacity to implement. Currently there is an intersessional process that is underway to look at ways to ensure sustainable funding for the Special Requirements Fund, and in addition to this SIDS are also having to search for alternative resourcing to help them to get out of non-compliant situations. Ideally, the full implementation of CMM 2013-06 and Article 30 would mean that the obligation to provide funding and resourcing to SIDS and participating territories were able to be resolved at the time a measure is adopted, rather than being aspects that have to be requested during the negotiations or afterwards."
WCPFC14,98,French Polynesia requested that consultation with SIDS in relation to CMM 2013-06 criteria should also extend to the French territories in the Pacific.
WCPFC14,99,"The Chair acknowledged that it was beneficial to have this discussion prior to commencing the consideration of new proposals and review of existing measures.  In summarising, the Chair noted that all CCMs who spoke expressed their support for CMM 2013-06 and a willingness to ensure that CMM 2013-06 is implemented properly.  There remain, however, some questions about how implementation can be improved and made more effective and these need further attention by the Commission.  CCMs were encouraged to continue considering these matters throughout the meeting in the consideration of new proposals.   4.2 Port Based measures / minimum standards"
WCPFC14,100,"The European Union introduced WCPFC14-2017-DP02 Proposal for a Conservation and Management Measure on WCPFC Scheme for Minimum Standards for Inspection in Port, confirming that the proposal is not being tabled for the first time.  The European Union noted that this year was more timely for this region to establish a regime for Port Inspections in light of recent ratifications of the FAO Port State Measures Agreement. The proposal was noted to be a “lighter” version of the Port State Measures international requirements, with minimum standards and a low level of fisheries inspections in port being prescribed. The main objective of the proposal was to combat and eradicate IUU fishing. It would subsequently have a positive direct and indirect contribution to development opportunities for SIDS. The proposal would mainly impact Port States within the Convention Area but the level of impact would depend on the number of inspections to be undertaken by the individual Port States. The mechanism proposed was intended to help SIDS with the necessary capacity to conduct a 23 5% level of inspection in port, which was considered significant to fight IUU fishing. The CMM 2013-06 checklist has been completed and is contained therein.  The European Union also drew attention to their report on implementation of Article 30, WCPFC14-2017-DP23 noting that within that paper there are a number of forms of assistance outlined that are seeking to directly provide assistance to SIDS in the areas of support to port inspections."
WCPFC14,101,"The Federated States of Micronesia, on behalf of FFA Members and Japan, introduced a joint proposal contained in WCPFC14-2017-DP12_Rev1 Proposal on Conservation and Management Measure for Port State Measures.  The proposal reflected joint efforts to commence the development of port state measures in the WCPF Convention Area. The purpose of this measure was to establish processes and procedures for CCMs to request that port inspections be undertaken on fishing vessels suspected of engaging in IUU fishing or fishing related activities in support of IUU fishing. It also provided guidelines for the training of inspectors. Addressing IUU fishing was of significant importance to FFA Members to ensure that their fishery resources could be managed sustainably, and that the necessary monitoring and compliance scheme (MCS) infrastructure was built to enable adequate responses to IUU fishing, and improve vessel compliance. Port State Measures were only one tool in a whole suite of MCS activities required to address IUU fishing, and must be incorporated into a broader and integrated MCS framework. It was explained that the proposal duly considered international requirements and differing capabilities within the ports of the region.  Importantly it sought to build on a number of regional initiatives developed by the FFA including Harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions for fishing access, and the Niue Treaty Subsidiary arrangements that among others facilitated sharing of MCS information and data and resources."
WCPFC14,102,"Japan thanked the European Union for their proposal in DP02, and thanked the FSM for presenting the joint proposal (DP12_rev1). Japan explained that having ratified the Port State Measures Agreement in May 2017, it was now able to fully implement Port State Measures.  However, it also recognised that it was not possible for all CCMs to achieve the same level of implementation at this point in time.  The proposal in DP12_rev1 sought to commence with a starting basis for Port Inspections that all CCMs were able to implement, noting that this may not be sufficient.  Attention was drawn to the two years review clause in the joint proposal, and it expressed a hope that after two years all CCMs might be in a position to implement a strengthened CMM that is more closely aligned to the FAO Port State Measures Agreement."
WCPFC14,103,"The United States noted it had long supported the adoption of a port state measure in WCPFC.  It confirmed that it had provided some comments to FFA on their proposal, and was also interested in incorporating some elements from the European Union proposal into the FFA proposal."
WCPFC14,104,"A number of CCMs confirmed their interest and support towards combining elements of the two proposals, with a view to having a single proposal that could be considered for adoption at WCPFC14.  WCPFC14 agreed to establish a SWG at this meeting (led by New Zealand) to consider the two proposals further."
WCPFC14,105,New Zealand provided brief updates to plenary on the SWG’s work throughout the course of the meeting. Several amendments were made to the joint FFA-Japan proposal and the final proposal for consideration is contained in WCPFC14-2017-DP12_Rev4 FFA and Japan Proposal on Port State Measures WG. New Zealand thanked Japan for their substantive work on this issue over the course of the WCPFC14.
WCPFC14,106,The Chair thanked New Zealand for its leadership in the SWG and for bringing a proposal forward for the Commission’s adoption.
WCPFC14,107,The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2017-02 Conservation and Management Measure on minimum standards for Port State Measures (Attachment E).  24 4.3 Protection of Observers
WCPFC14,108,"Japan introduced WCPFC14-2017-DP03 Proposal to amend Conservation and Management Measure for the Protection of WCPFC Regional Observer Programme (ROP) observers (CMM 2016-03), which proposes the deletion of footnote 1 in CMM 2016-03 that provided additional time for Japan to implement the provisions of the CMM. Japan confirmed that following the last annual session, Japan had the time to review the requirements and to take the necessary domestic measures to fully implement all the provisions of CMM 2016-03."
WCPFC14,109,The Republic of Marshall Islands expressed appreciation to Japan for taking the necessary steps to be in a position to remove the footnote from CMM 2016-03.  It emphasised that it is incumbent on all CCMs and the Commission to ensure the full implementation of this measure and supported the improved safety of ROP observers in the region.
WCPFC14,110,The Chair noted the Commission’s appreciation of Japan’s efforts over the last year and CCMs supported the proposal to remove the footnote from CMM 2016-03.
WCPFC14,111,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2017-03 Conservation Management Measure for the Protection of WCPFC Regional Observer Programme Observers (Attachment F), which will replace CMM 2016-03.  4.4 Observer Conduct"
WCPFC14,112,"The Republic of Korea introduced its joint proposal with Japan contained in WCPFC14-2017-DP19 Proposed Conservation and Management Measure on the Standards of Conduct for ROP observers. They proposed that major components of the Code of Conduct for Observers, presented by the Intersessional Working Group on Regional Observer Program (IWG-ROP) meeting which reported to the Commission in March 2008, be taken out and placed into a measure to ensure that Regional Observer Programme (ROP) Observers discharge their duties to ROP requirements and not engage in any activity likely to bring the ROP into disrepute.  Korea argued that such a decision would contribute to the attainment of the objectives of the ROP and the safety of those on board the vessel on which ROP Observers are deployed. The proposal built on paragraph 2 of Attachment K, Annex A of CMM 2007-01 (CMM on ROP), which broadly outlined the responsibilities of observers. The proposal also envisaged a scheme that allows the master of vessels to check and report the conduct of Observers on board their vessels. Crew and masters would be held to the same standards as observers. This proposal was developed in response to a growing number of incidents that involve ROP Observers’ misconduct that often threaten the safety of the crew on board and interfered with the proper functioning of the vessel conducting lawful fishing operations."
WCPFC14,113,"Japan thanked Korea for explaining the joint proposal. Both CCMs viewed the regional observer programme to be important but they had been experiencing several incidents of observer’s misbehaving and the frequency of misbehaviour was increasing. Although Japan did not insist on the adoption of a code of conduct for ROP observers, they were of the view that something needed to be done to address the issue."
WCPFC14,114,"The Cook Islands drew the Commission’s attention to FFA Member views on this proposal contained in paper WCPFC14-2017-DP08 Views on Observer Safety and Korea's Proposed CMM on Observer Conduct. FFA Members thanked Korea and Japan but could not support the joint proposal on ROP observer conduct. Their foremost concern was supporting strengthening and improving the safety and welfare of observers. CMM 2016-03 on observer safety was only a starting point, and work must continue to assist the observers. FFA Members had commenced work in the important area of observers’ insurance coverage and would share the results in due course. Key concerns with the 25 proposal include: Observer safety was FFA Members’ key focus, SIDS were not consulted for the CMM 2013-06 SIDS impact assessment and therefore did not believe this was undertaken properly, several aspects of the proposal were already covered in the FFA Code of Conduct and in CMM 2007-01, and some of the observer programmes applied more stringent national codes. There is already an existing form for a master to complete if there was a complaint about an observer and this was a matter best addressed at national level as recognised at the IWG-ROP meeting in July 2008, which rightly noted in particular that codes may need to vary to cater for cultural and religious sensitivities. FFA Members remained committed to improving national and sub-regional ROP programs. Cook Islands further echoed an earlier statement congratulating Japan for its internal work this year to ensure it could now fully implement CMM 2016-03."
WCPFC14,115,China and Chinese Taipei both indicated their support for the intent of the proposal.  Chinese Taipei noted such a proposal would improve observers conduct.  China indicated a preference that any issues related to observer behaviour are transparently addressed at the Commission.
WCPFC14,116,"The Republic of Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea and Tuvalu all expressed their support for the intervention by the Cook Islands and reiterated the view of FFA Members, that their priority was the safety of the observers. There was a fundamental problem that needed to be addressed relating to the difference between ROP observers and national programme observers. For purse seine vessels, observers were provided from within Commission member national programmes so regulations at the national level were already in place if there were incidents related to observers’ behaviour. The Commission was not advised of these issues because they were national issues."
WCPFC14,117,The TCC Chair noted that the TCC agreed at TCC13 to form a TCC working group on mechanisms to improve access to ROP observer reports. It was further suggested that perhaps the scope of the TCC working group could be expanded to give some consideration to this matter.  The suggestion was supported by the European Union.
WCPFC14,118,"WWF indicated they supported the statements of RMI and Tuvalu. This proposal was put forward with very little evidence of misbehaviour of observers and little evidence of misconduct or failure of current processes. Therefore, this CMM was unnecessary at this time. As there was clear evidence of harm done to observers, there was an opportunity for this Commission to look at broader issues especially in regard to human rights issues on boats."
WCPFC14,119," Korea addressed several of the key concerns raised namely: i) Regarding safety: the observer code of conduct was to ensure observer safety. It was regrettable that insurance was more important than observers. ii) Regarding CMM 2013-06: According to paragraph 3 of this CMM, the Commission shall apply 8 questions and carry out an impact assessment. This had not been done. There should be an assessment at the commission level to see who has additional burden. iii) This proposal was about what could be achieved at Commission level for the observer programme in this region. Masters and crew were already subject to relevant codes of conduct under United Nations, International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and flag state regulations. In general Korea would like this proposed code of conduct to be implemented by all CCMs, so this Commission could be a leading model amongst all RFMOs, while being respectful of different cultures and religions. It further noted there was an appeals process, which gave observers a chance to appeal misbehaviour complaints. Korea indicated being open to removing this text if it was seen to be problematic. The intention was to reduce the risk of violence on board."
WCPFC14,120,"Japan responded to comments on lack of evidence, reiterating that some of the observers were actually arrested by police and that this was clear evidence. The objective was to reduce the numbers of incidents on board fishing vessels and after the observer disembarks the vessel. It asked members to consider further ways to rectify this situation.  26"
WCPFC14,121,"The Chair summarised that there did not seem to be support for the proposal to be further considered at this meeting by an informal SWG.  However, there was some support for further consideration of this matter intersessionally through the TCC observer related working group.  The Chair suggested that CCMs give consideration to expanding the scope of the TCC’s ROP intersessional working group to allow for continuation of discussions related to observer code of conduct."
WCPFC14,122,Discussions continued under consideration of the TCC13 Report (Agenda Item 9.3) where some proposed language to expand the scope of the TCC observer related IWG to cover the related issues in WCPFC14-2017-DP19 was considered. FFA CCMs reiterated their position of non-support to the further consideration of the Korea and Japan proposal but did not rule out a possible general discussion of observer conduct by the TCC observer related IWG.
WCPFC14,123,"WCPFC14 noted that TCC13 formed an intersessional working group to “address the need for CCMs to obtain copies of observer reports for their vessels in a timely manner so that they may fulfil their responsibility to undertake investigations of possible violations.  The group will explore ways to facilitate access to observer reports from both ROP Providers and the Secretariat, and will recommend possible improvements to the CMM for the Regional Observer Programme, the Agreed Minimum Standards and Guidelines of the Regional Observer Programme, and/or other Commission decisions.” (TCC13 Summary Report, para 161)."
WCPFC14,124,"WCPFC14 agreed to expand the scope of work of that working group to include the issue of observer conduct, and tasked that working group to provide any recommendations to TCC14.  The working group should consider Korea and Japan’s proposal to WCPFC14 on observer conduct (WCPFC14-2017-DP19) and the deliberations of WCPFC14 on that proposal.   4.5 RFV CMM 2013-10 amendment"
WCPFC14,125,"Samoa, on behalf of FFA Members, introduced WCPFC14-2017-DP10 Proposal to amend paragraph 21 of CMM 2013-10. The proposal was to support the continued operation of Samoa’s domestic albacore longline fishing vessels (15m to 23m) that fish only in the Samoa EEZ, but unload their catch in neighbouring American Samoa. This would be achieved by avoiding the operational costs that would be incurred by Samoan vessel owners in configuring their domestic vessels to meet Commission VMS standards in cases where they offload in Pago Pago."
WCPFC14,126,"Samoa, in response to a question of clarification from Japan seeking clarification about how many fishing vessels would be exempted by the proposal, clarified that the exemption would only apply to four vessels and none of them operated or fished on the high seas. They only operated in Samoa’s EEZ which was the smallest in the region. The “adjacent port” referenced in the initial draft submitted for consideration was American Samoa and was only 40 miles away. The intent was that these vessels could also use that adjacent CCM’s port for the purpose of unloading its catch in that port."
WCPFC14,127,In the margins of this meeting the United States and other interested CCMs worked with Samoa on revising the text of the proposal as contained at WCPFC14-2017-DP10_rev3.
WCPFC14,128,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2017-05 Conservation and Management Measure for the Record of Fishing Vessels and Authorisation to Fish (Attachment G), which will replace CMM 2013-10.   27 4.6 Marine Pollution"
WCPFC14,129,"The Republic of the Marshall Islands, on behalf of FFA Members, introduced WCPFC14-2017-DP15 Proposal for a Conservation and Management Measure to limit marine pollution from fishing vessels. This new conservation measure was designed to address concerns that certain activities associated with fishing may affect the Western and Central Pacific marine environment and that these activities may play a notable role in WCPFC’s efforts to minimise incidental mortality of non-target species and impacts on marine ecosystems. Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear in the marine environment can damage marine, reef and coastal habitats, be harmful to marine life through ghost fishing, entanglement, ingestion and acting as habitat for the spread of invasive species, and became a navigation hazard. This proposal encouraged CCMs to better implement the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) legal instruments developed to address marine pollution they are party to; and encourage others to become party to these instruments at the earliest possible opportunity."
WCPFC14,130,"A number of CCMs spoke in support of the proposal and its objective, and expressed their appreciation to FFA members for taking the initiative.  Some CCMs indicated they already provided some draft amendments on the proposal.  There was agreement to have further discussions on the proposal through an informal SWG led by RMI. The final version of the proposal is contained at WCPFC14-2017-DP15_rev3."
WCPFC14,131,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2017-04 Conservation and Management Measure on Marine Pollution (Attachment H), with a date of implementation on 1 January 2019. AGENDA ITEM 5 – SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES  5.1 Updated checklist evaluation of SIDS special requirements (FFA)"
WCPFC14,132,"Tokelau, on behalf of FFA Members, introduced WCPFC14-2017-DP07 Special Requirement Fund, which was a key priority for FFA Members. The paper built on discussions at WCPFC13 regarding the voluntary nature of the Fund and the need to ensure its sustainability, especially for supporting the travel needs of SIDS nationals to participate in meetings. TCC13 recommended that WCPFC14 consider an approach to address the specific challenge of making the links between which sources of assistance can best meet SIDS and Territories’ needs, and how that assistance can be systematically tracked to ensure its delivery. As the complexity and diversity of issues for the Commission’s consideration had expanded and evolved, it had become impossible for one SIDS representative to cover all issues at these meetings. It proposed funding for 2 SIDS’ participants to Commission-related meetings through an amendment to the Financial Regulations. In previous discussions FFA members have asserted that disproportionate burden on SIDS can apply either as outcomes from the adoption of measures or as an administrative burden to adequately participate in the work of the Commission and funding an additional delegate will be a tangible way of addressing this second component. If the Commission could agree to amend the Financial Regulations, FFA members could agree that mandatory contributions to the SRF were not required for the time being."
WCPFC14,133,"FFA Members further thanked those that had contributed to the Fund and advised that its Members continued to draw on this important source of assistance. FFA Members also proposed that the Commission revisit the question of mandatory contributions at the end of the 3 year trial period for the Strategic Investment Plan (SIP) to ensure the Fund had been maintained and there had been no issues with availing funds in response to SIDS’ needs. They also proposed strengthening the Principles, Guidelines and Operational Procedures for this Fund to assist the WCPFC Executive Director in assessing and selecting projects to be funded from the Special Requirements Fund. 28"
WCPFC14,134,"Fiji, on behalf of FFA, reiterated that addressing the Special Requirements of Developing States was a high priority and an issue that would arise throughout the Commission meeting. There was a clear need to ‘join the dots’ between SIDS’ needs (individual and collective) and sources of assistance. At WCPFC11, FFA Members tabled a SIDS Checklist to set their specific needs which assisted in prioritising the assistance received from the Commission and developed CCMs. WCPFC11 agreed that this be considered as a “guide to assist developed CCMs to assess the status of assistance to SIDS”. As advised to WCPFC13, FFA Members were considering an approach to the SIDS Checklist to make it an effective and efficient tool. In the meantime, the SIDS Checklist consisted of the capacity needs identified in the Final Compliance Monitoring Report, and were to be treated as priority areas requiring assistance. Fiji thanked the IWG- Special Requirement Fund Chair Liz Brierley of Australia for her hard work to coordinate views since WCPFC13 on the issue of ensuring the sustainability of the Special Requirements Fund."
WCPFC14,135,"Fiji further noted that in WCPFC14-2017-DP07, FFA Members supported the concept of the Strategic Investment Plan (SIP). They viewed this as the overall mechanism for making the links between the SIDS’ needs and funding sources. It would assist with pulling all capacity needs together, guiding investments and identifying sources of funding. In setting out SIDS’ priority needs, they saw the SIP incorporating the concept of the ‘FFA SIDS Checklist’ –– essentially, this SIDS-driven Plan would include the priority areas of assistance as articulated by SIDS. They recognised that resources would be required to develop the SIP, and proposes that the Commission allocate funds for this work to take place in 2018. FFA also concurred with the IWG Chair’s proposal that the SIP is established for a 3-year trial period."
WCPFC14,136,The Chair noted that these discussions were also ongoing at the Finance and Administration Committee which would be reported back to plenary.  5.2 CCM reports on the implementation of Article 30
WCPFC14,137,"The Republic of the Marshall Islands, on behalf of FFA members supported the comments made earlier in relation to the better implementation of CMM 2013-06. It reiterated the sentiments made when it introduced the paper WCPFC14-2017-DP11 Implementation of CMM 2013-06, under Agenda Item 4.1 It reiterated the point FFA Members had made that Article 30 was about making this Commission a success by accounting for the vulnerabilities of all SIDS in all work of the Commission."
WCPFC14,138,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA Members, regretfully noted that after close analysis there was the impression that not all CCMs took the 2013-06 process seriously. Some did, and SIDS were particularly grateful to those that actually consulted SIDS before they prepare their CMM2013-06 responses. It urged all proponents of CMMs to do the same to save time during Commission meetings, as early consultation would more likely to lead to agreement. Any proposal that did not include or seriously address CMM 2013-06 requirements would need to be revised before it could be considered by FFA members in the future. CMM 2013-06 was a binding measure that expressed a fundamental principle of the Convention. FFA Members drew particular attention to Rev 5 of the tropical tuna bridging measure, which contained numerous specific proposals that had not been assessed under CMM 2013-06. This made it challenging to determine whether or not the end result would be fit for purpose and would avoid placing a disproportionate burden on SIDS. This is why FFA Members have called for proponents of specific proposals in the Rev 5 bridging measure to provide assessments as part of this discussion. PNA Members had provided a comprehensive analysis of their own proposals and FFA Members would continue to monitor this as the measure is being developed. During the course of this meeting careful attention would be given to the way that proposals stack up against the CMM 2013-06 criteria. And over the course of 2018 FFA Members would be thinking about better mechanisms to assess the conformity of Commission measures, requirements and procedures against CMM 2013-06 standards. 29"
WCPFC14,139,"Niue reiterated the FFA Members’ position on this issue. SIDS were not looking for development assistance from this Commission. Development assistance was a separate process covered by separate intergovernmental processes. Assistance through the Commission and its processes needed to continually focus on ways and means to ensure that the Commission as a whole could achieve its objectives. The Commission needed to demonstrate: i) A fair voice in the work of the Commission; ii) A commitment to management measures that both avoid placing a disproportionate burden on SIDS and provide a fair share of the benefits from fishing the resources in their regions; iii) Technical or financial assistance that was oriented towards meeting critical capacity or resource constraints that would otherwise prevent CMMs from being agreed by SIDS, or would result in SIDS simply not being able to meet their obligations; iv) Greater policy coherency so that the generosity and support of developed CCMs through their donor roles and general foreign policies was not undermined by WCPFC positions focussed solely on the financial interests of their fishing fleets."
WCPFC14,140,"The European Union advised that WCPFC14-2017-DP23 Report of the European Union on Article 30 of the Convention and Resolution 2008-01 of WCPFC, was posted which detailed its implementation of Article 30. European Union’s development assistance to the Pacific amounted to about €45 million which was negotiated with several regional organisations including the FFA and SPC. It addressed the development needs of the Pacific as determined through regional processes. Some of the identified priorities include combatting IUU fishing and building capacity in the area of scientific services. European Union mentioned that €1 million has been earmarked to cater for the compliance capacity needs identified by TCC to assist with enhanced capacity of members to comply with their obligations under CMMs."
WCPFC14,141,"Japan had noted that it understood the importance of CMM 2013-06 criteria and had undertaken a number of consultations with FFA Members in relation to the tropical tuna measure and the port states measure resulting in a joint proposal for the latter. No consultation was undertaken in respect of the proposal for code of conduct for observers as it thought there would be no disproportionate burden from what was proposed. Japan stated that they would continue to have prior consultation with other members as much as possible.  Japan continued to provide overseas development assistance to Pacific islands through JICA and Overseas Fishery Cooperation Foundation of Japan (OFCF) for infrastructure and provision of technical services. In the last 5 years Japan provided about $740 million in development assistance to the Pacific Islands focusing on fisheries related projects that cover management of highly migratory fish stocks and assistance to small scale fisheries. At the last Pacific Leaders Meeting with the Prime Minister of Japan (PALM7), Prime Minister Abe pledged no less than $500 million development assistance plus human resources development assistance for no less than 4,000 people. Japan also provides the Japan Trust Fund and the OFCF Promotion Fund with FFA which was recently extended for another 10 years due to a strong request from Pacific Island countries."
WCPFC14,142,Chinese Taipei drew attention to its work on technical assistance and joint fishing conservation and management activities. It referred to the establishment of the Chinese Taipei Trust Fund last year that supported capacity building efforts of the SIDS. It further advised that Chinese Taipei also assisted in building fishing vessels for SIDS under request. Chinese Taipei continued to encourage its private sector to invest in the fishing sector through development cooperation with the SIDS.
WCPFC14,143,"Republic of Korea explained that it continued to provide development assistance to SIDS focusing in two main areas. Firstly, capacity building through education. Korea provided assistance for the establishment of the school of Technical and Marine Studies in the Solomon Islands that would open in February 2018 and would welcome students from other SIDS. Korea had also opened a pilot project on the World Fisheries University under the auspices of FAO to provide quality education for developing States in the fisheries sector. Secondly, it had focused on preventing IUU fishing through enhanced MCS capacity by assisting with the establishment of remote monitoring systems designed to be particularly useful to CCMs with vast EEZs but lacked the systems to monitor their large waters. 30"
WCPFC14,144,Kiribati acknowledged the funding support available for SIDS through the Commission which had benefitted Kiribati and other SIDS in understanding their obligations and their capacity to comply with those obligations. Kiribati encouraged developed CCMs to continue this funding support and encouraged CCMs with new proposals to consult with SIDS during the development of those proposals.  5.3 Review of implementation of CMM 2013-07 (Paragraph 20)
WCPFC14,145,"The Chair suggested that since a lot of discussion on this issue had already occurred and that it would continue throughout the meeting, the floor would not be open for further discussion.  AGENDA ITEM 6 – HARVEST STRATEGY"
WCPFC14,146,"Discussion under this agenda item centred around the Agreed Work Plan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06, covering skipjack, bigeye, yellowfin, and South Pacific albacore (WCPFC14-2017-IP02)."
WCPFC14,147,"Australia, at the invitation of the Chair, introduced WCPFC14-2017-DP27 Possible revision to Harvest Strategy Workplan.  This paper contained some suggested changes to the workplan for CCMs to consider including: i). extending the current workplan out to 2021 to allow for the ongoing work towards adoption of harvest strategies for the four of the key tuna stocks; ii) reframing the work on bigeye and yellowfin tuna given the recent scientific advice on the status of bigeye from rebuilding timeline to developing a target reference point; and iii) proposing a dedicated discussion in 2018 by SC and the Commission of management objectives in terms of candidate target reference points for bigeye and yellowfin. Australia recognised the clear need for decisions to be made at this meeting to ensure progress beyond 2017 and a clear need to stagger the development of harvest control strategies for four of the key tuna stocks to accommodate the capacity limitations of the scientific service provider SPC. New Zealand has generously donated funding to SPC to facilitate further progress on harvest strategy work for bigeye and yellowfin. Australia offered during WCPFC14 to update the workplan to take into account the progress made through the harvest strategy agenda items since WCPFC13, and to provide a draft revised Harvest Strategy Workplan for adoption by WCPFC14. It welcomed feedback from CCMs on the proposed revisions and other suggestions."
WCPFC14,148,"Papua New Guinea, on behalf of FFA members, noted their concerns with the lack of time and resources the Commission and its subsidiary bodies had committed to progressing the development of harvest strategies as the key mechanism for moving the management of WCPO fisheries to a strategically managed stock approach. Multiple agenda items with no papers to support discussions, and inadequate time allocated to SWGs at the Commission and SC to progress key elements such as performance indicators, ultimately resulted in ongoing delays to the adoption of the harvest strategy workplan. FFA Members thanked Australia for providing potential amendments to and extension of the workplan, as it reflected the Commissions agreement to a stepwise approach towards harvest strategies, with concurrent work on all of the main stocks. Future possible amendments could also include the addition of other Commission stocks, such as north Pacific albacore, and Pacific bluefin tuna."
WCPFC14,149,The Chair appreciated the concerns expressed over the lack of sufficient time available to the Commission to fully consider the development of harvest strategies and asked for suggestions from concerned CCMs on how the Commission agenda should be restructured to allow for more time to be devoted to harvest strategies. The Chair noted the growing number of priority issues for the CCMs and the time constraint posed by the allotted five meeting days has made it challenging for the Commission to commit the necessary and adequate attention to a number of important issues. 31
WCPFC14,150,"The United States appreciated Australia’s efforts to keep the Commission on track with this workplan, and supported an annual review of the document to make adjustments where necessary. Regarding proposed tasks for 2018 and the proposed changes for bigeye and yellowfin in reference to the discussion on management objectives and candidate target reference points (TRP) for these species, the US pointed out that the Commission has been discussing management objectives of fisheries more broadly over the last several years, i.e. for the tropical purse seine fishery and this year for the tropical longline fishery. The US suggested the reference in the workplan for 2017 to performance indicators for longline fisheries should be broken into tropical longline, and southern longline performance indicators."
WCPFC14,151,"The European Union noted that this work was fundamental to the Commission’s future management of all its stocks as it moved towards management strategies and harvest control rules. Therefore, it was necessary to dedicate more time to look into these issues, and it should also be specifically accounted for in the budget of the Commission because it was such a critical issue. SWGs did not allow for enough dedicated time and resources to consider this issue, and not every CCM had the capacity to participate in these groups. The European Union noted there was still some confusion about this complex conceptual framework, and considered it easier if various elements were adopted as interim measures, so there was more flexibility to revise them before a framework was built."
WCPFC14,152,The Republic of Korea appreciated Australia’s proposed amendments to reflect practicalities without losing the good progress made at previous meetings. It agreed that work scheduled last year was rushed and accordingly the plan seemed a bit ambitious. It supported that the work plan should be a living document that could be amended from time to time.
WCPFC14,153,"Japan expressed concerns with the proposed way forward for skipjack, noting the Commission already had a separate CMM with a target reference point (TRP) for skipjack, which clearly noted the TRP would be reviewed by the Commission no later than 2019. It asked that the workplan is updated to duly reflect CMM 2015-06. It also noted the deferral of adoption of a target reference point for South Pacific albacore at WCPFC13, had indicated at the time that the adoption of a TRP for south Pacific albacore would be the likely focus for this meeting.  Considering the number of SWGs focusing on other issues at this meeting, it noted there will likely not be same time available as last year to consider other species, so there may be a need for an intersessional meeting to continue discussion on a TRP for South Pacific albacore. In general, it was noted that it would be difficult to agree on a way forward for the work plan until the whole package could be seen."
WCPFC14,154,"Tokelau noted that at this stage PNA Members did not support any further workshops or other intersessional meetings dedicated to harvest strategy discussions, as SIDS had limited resources available to attend additional meetings. PNA Members preferred this issue being discussed at Commission meetings as one of the key issues, and TRPs should remain the focus, however suggested that a one-day workshop alongside SC14 could be one way to align managers and scientists to make progress on harvest strategy work. When PNA Members agreed to the Harvest Strategy Workplan, they did so on the basis that this work would be integrated into the work of the SC, TCC and the Commission, and not involve additional subsidiary bodies or meetings. They found the earlier Management Objectives Workshops very useful for exchanging ideas and building understanding on management objectives and the application of reference points and harvest control rules. However, the value of the workshops declined over time as the discussions shifted from general approaches to more specific issues on which decisions need to be taken, and the workshops were not effective when recommendations needed to be developed for Commission consideration.  PNA Members further noted that the Management Issues theme of the SC had been a very effective forum for similar discussions on issues related to reference points and harvest control rules and thought that should continue to be the focal point for the Commission’s work on harvest strategies. As a compromise, PNA was prepared to consider trying a one-day workshop in association with the SC. The aim of this would be to provide an opportunity for promoting dialogue between managers and scientists on harvest strategy work. In 32 putting this forward, they wanted to make it clear that they had real doubts about the value of the workshop type approach to advancing the Harvest Strategy work."
WCPFC14,155,"Indonesia thanked Australia for their leadership on the Harvest Strategy Workplan and noted that this process was very important for the movement towards strategic management of all stocks in the WCPO. When considering the Workplan, the information provided in the draft workplan addressed harvest strategy in relation to TRPs and mostly focused on the development of indicators. However, in 2016 candidate management objectives were recorded and this Workplan still did not provide a clear way forward to achieve all those objectives."
WCPFC14,156,"The European Union, in response to the views of FFA and PNA Members on additional meetings, considered that it would be difficult to facilitate the attendance of managers and commissioners at an SC meeting and therefore the proposal for a one day workshop at the margins of the Scientific Committee in their view would have limited benefit. The Commission already had an adopted Workplan that guides its work, but it needed to be more effective about making decisions. The European Union considered making progress on this issue to be a high priority and would prefer to have a dedicated workshop back to back with the Annual Meeting to facilitate appropriate participation."
WCPFC14,157,"Australia considered the Harvest Strategy Workplan a key priority, and while it recognised the European Union’s views, it was happy to endorse the position of PNA Members and look at an extra day at the SC. They believed extra time from the Commission also needed to be found, and it was also critical that all members had a strong commitment to make progress i.e. on the South Pacific albacore TRP which had already suffered many years of delay. With respect to the query from Indonesian on how the management objectives would develop into harvest strategies to achieve those objectives, Australia pointed out that a set of performance indicators and management strategies were developed in 2017. The next step was to have SPC, assess whether those performance indicators have been achieved against those objectives. Australia further recognised that not every objective can be achieved and that trade-offs might be necessary. Australia indicated its willingness to further discuss these issues with interested delegations in the margins of the meeting."
WCPFC14,158,"Pew Charitable Trusts, on behalf of Pew Charitable Trusts, WWF, Sustainable Fisheries Partnership, Environmental Defense Fund, ISSF, Greenpeace, and International Pole and Line Foundation, expressed concern that despite a harvest strategy being a clear priority for the Commission and critical to resolving many of its key challenges including ensuring sustainability, the continued refusal to accept progress will mean additional work and intersessional meetings are necessary. Either the Commission is serious about this process, or it is not. Whether progress is made intersessionally or within the existing Commission processes, it needs to happen. They collectively thanked Australia for the revised work plan, and strongly urged all CCMs to commit to the appropriate level of activity needed to achieve the work plan."
WCPFC14,159,Australia noted the importance of committing sufficient time to harvest strategy discussions and welcomed working with other CCMs in the margins of the meeting to develop a way forward for a proposal that could be agreed on at this meeting. This was agreed as a way forward to progress the revision of the Harvest Strategy Workplan.  The further discussions and the outcome for the update of the Harvest Strategy Workplan are recorded under Agenda 6.9.
WCPFC14,160,"Following the initial consideration of the Harvest Strategy Workplan, the Chair led discussions through each of the Agenda 6 sub-agenda items.  Prior to commencing this discussion it was clarified that the NC13 outcomes would provide the basis for discussions on Agenda item 6.8.    33 6.1 Management objectives (all stocks/fisheries)"
WCPFC14,161,"The Chair reminded that at WCPFC13, the Commission accepted the suggested initial list of performance indicators for tropical purse-seine fisheries as developed by the Small Working Group on Management Objectives at WCPFC13 for the purpose of the evaluation of harvest control rules (Attachment M, WCPFC13 Summary Report)."
WCPFC14,162,The United States noted the outcome from SC13 related to candidate performance indicators and monitoring strategies for tropical longline and southern longline fisheries and noted that papers providing a potential list of performance indicators were contained in WCPFC14-2017-IP02 and WCPFC14-2017-IP03.  The United States confirmed that they would like to review the list of potential performance indicators to be used for the management strategy evaluation in longline fisheries at WCPFC14.  The Chair asked that this be raised under Agenda Item 6.7.   6.2 Acceptable levels of risk (all stocks)
WCPFC14,163,"The Chair referred the meeting to WCPFC13 draft summary report paragraph 296, which stated that “Commission agreed to: i) not specify, at this time, acceptable levels of risk of breaching the limit reference point for each stock; ii) consider any risk level greater than 20 percent to be inconsistent with the LRP related principle in UNFSA (as referenced in Article 6 of the Convention) including that the risk of breaching limit reference points be very low; and iii) determine the acceptability of potential HCRs where the estimated risk of breaching the limit reference point is between 0 and 20%.”"
WCPFC14,164,"Japan stressed that the Commission had already agreed that the risk of breaching LRP shall be no more than 20% and other CCMs should respect this in considering the new CMM for tropical tunas, particularly with respect to bigeye tuna."
WCPFC14,165,"The European Union sought clarification on whether the decision last year on acceptable levels of risk was an interim decision, or whether the TRP for South Pacific albacore being considered at this meeting was the interim measure, as there was mixed reference in papers submitted to this meeting for consideration."
WCPFC14,166,"Tuvalu and other FFA members were of the view that given no new information had been presented to the Commission suggesting the decision be reviewed, FFA members did not support a review of the decision made at WCPFC13 to not specify acceptable levels of risk at this time. The level of acceptable risk appropriate for a particular species depended on various other elements of the harvest strategy, including the Limit and Target Reference Points, the current status of the stock, and the economic implications of Harvest Control Rules that achieve the TRP. Given that most of these elements are yet to be developed for most species, it would be premature to agree to a fixed acceptable level of risk when the consequences of that decision could not be understood."
WCPFC14,167,"Tokelau on behalf of PNA members supported the intervention made by Tuvalu and FFA members. In response to the European Union’s question on what was agreed at the last meeting, Tokelau noted that the decision language could be found in paragraph 296 of the WCPFC13 Summary Report."
WCPFC14,168,The Chair noted that the decision taken last year on acceptable levels of risk would not be reopened and agreed that papers submitted to future meetings should use language consistent with the agreed decisions of previous meetings. 34 6.3 Review of rebuilding timeline (bigeye tuna)
WCPFC14,169,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members noted that given that the latest stock assessment showed that the bigeye stock was not experiencing overfishing and was not in an overfished condition, FFA members were of the view that there was no longer a need for a rebuilding timeframe for bigeye."
WCPFC14,170,The Chair agreed that in the light of recent updates of scientific advice this work plan item for a rebuilding plan for bigeye was no longer relevant.  The Chair asked that Australia take this update into account in revising the Harvest Strategy Workplan.  6.4 Target reference point (South Pacific albacore tuna)
WCPFC14,171,"Samoa, on behalf of FFA Members, introduced WCPFC14-2017-DP13 Proposal for Establishing a Target Reference Point for South Pacific Albacore, which proposed a brief and simple CMM that would establish a target reference point (TRP) for the stock that reflected a management objective for the benefit all CCMs with a real interest in the fishery: that of increasing south Pacific albacore catch rates over a period of time. It was noted that for the last three years there had not been any credible alternative proposals tabled by CCMs in response to the element in the Harvest Strategy Workplan that was agreed under CMM 2014-06. FFA members were very aware of the effort reductions required in this fishery before it could be restored to a reasonable level of financial sustainability, and the undeniable development impacts that this will have on many SIDS. FFA Members further noted that future allocation of reductions and the potential distribution of conservation burdens would need to be very carefully considered by the Commission in the design of management measures to achieve the TRP over time. A precautionary approach should be taken to avoid placing a disproportionate burden on developing small-island coastal CCMs. FFA Members further noted that the South Pacific albacore stock was the basis for the only commercially viable tuna fishery in several Pacific SIDS. In recent years declining catch rate required wholesale vessel tie-ups in many domestic fleets. The lower than average fuel prices lately allowed some fleets to continue fishing, particularly those that enjoyed operational subsidies. However, if the Commission allows the stock to continue to drop, even those fleets will not be able to operate. Last year some CCMs could not accept the idea of a spawning biomass-based TRP, so the seventeen FFA CCMs have agreed to change the basis of the TRP proposal. Instead of maintaining a certain level of spawning biomass, a relative longline catch rate would be maintained. It was proposed that relative catch rates in the fishery be increased over the next ten years to 10% higher than 2013 levels, and over the next twenty years to 17% higher than 2013 levels. As it was difficult to track fleet-specific or average longline catch rates directly, the proposal has taken on board the suggestion from the Commission’s scientific service provider and uses “longline Vulnerable Biomass” as the indicator for average longline CPUE. This catch-rate TRP has several advantages over a spawning biomass TRP. Further details are contained in the paper. FFA Members noted that the proposal sets a modest timeframe of twenty years for achieving its target, and urged that the Commission take steps at this meeting to adopt a TRP as proposed noting that the proposal sought to provide a reasonable proposal that should be more acceptable to all Members. FFA members look forward to working with all CCMs towards achieving agreement on a TRP at this meeting at SWG, noting that the Commission had agreed at WCPFC13 to not defer adoption of a TRP for South Pacific albacore beyond this meeting."
WCPFC14,172,"Environmental Defense Fund, on behalf of Environmental Defense Fund, WWF, Greenpeace, ISSF, Sustainable Fisheries Partnership, International Pole and Line Foundation and Pew Charitable Trusts, delivered a statement.  They thanked FFA and New Zealand for their leadership to advance management of South Pacific albacore, and they acknowledged how the proposal had evolved since the last meeting.  The southern longline fishery, whilst not generating the same volume of economic return as the tropical fisheries, nonetheless was a vital component of many Small Island Developing States’ economies.  Unfortunately, the fishery is no longer economically viable, catch rates are declining and the Scientific Committee has advised that fishing mortality and catch need to be reduced.  35 It was highlighted that WCPFC14-2017-IP08 Trends in the South Pacific albacore longline and troll fisheries makes it clear that there is an expectation that vulnerable biomass is expected to continue to decrease.  The Harvest Strategy framework is a critical part of the future management framework for this fishery.  The adoption of a target reference point is also a critical for many fisheries obtaining MSC certification, which is an important financial incentive for these fisheries. The South Pacific albacore TRP was supposed to be adopted by the Commission in 2015, it is now two years overdue from the original Commission decision. They strongly urge CCMs to work together to adopt a TRP for South Pacific albacore at this meeting."
WCPFC14,173,"The Pacific Islands Tuna Industry Association (PITIA) expressed their concern and strongly urged that the Commission come to agreement on the harvest strategy elements that were committed to under the Harvest Strategy Workplan, including the adoption of a TRP for South Pacific albacore.  This fishery is in dire circumstances, catch rates cannot support the current costs of fishing, leaving many fishing companies barely surviving.  Catch rates continue to fall, and the inability of the Commission to curb the increases in catches in the high seas is seen to be a failure to manage the fisheries under its charge.  PITIA strongly urged the Commission to take the necessary steps at this meeting to ensure the long-term sustainability and future viability of the southern longline fisheries for the future."
WCPFC14,174,Members agreed to establish an informal SWG led by New Zealand to consider both the draft bridging measure and the proposal for a TRP.
WCPFC14,175,"New Zealand reported on the outcomes from the SWG on South Pacific albacore in respect of the proposed TRP. The proposal from FFA members (WCPFC14-2017-DP13) was the only formal proposal received for consideration by the SWG. New Zealand further noted that there was a lengthy discussion on the TRP issue over the course of the meeting and regretted that no consensus could be reached. While most CCMs strongly supported progress being made to adopt a South Pacific albacore TRP at this meeting, there were two Members who maintained their position that a decision should not be made on a South Pacific albacore TRP this year. These members wanted to see the result of the stock assessment next year and based on the consideration of the outcome of the stock assessment, the Commission (at WCPFC15) could decide whether the TRP was necessary. New Zealand expressed disappointment that consensus could not be reached at this meeting and particularly given that the decision on TRP was deferred from WCPFC13 to this meeting."
WCPFC14,176,"Fiji, on behalf of FFA Members and many Participating Territories, asked that the Commission adopt the TRP as proposed by FFA at this meeting. It fully supported the roadmap that was presented by New Zealand as the outcome of the SWG. The harvest strategy would be more directed and focused if there was TRP agreed at this meeting. In the absence of a TRP the process was an open ended one and the Commission’s work would go in circles. Fiji strongly emphasised its great disappointment with its engagement in this forum over the last fifteen years was that there had not been sufficient management consideration of South Pacific albacore by this Commission. It was time for the Commission to make definitive progress on harvest strategy for South Pacific albacore at this meeting. Fiji stated its view that it is not appropriate to wait for the next stock assessment and the Commission must make a decision at this meeting."
WCPFC14,177,New Caledonia confirmed their support to the statement of Fiji and its proposed way forward.
WCPFC14,178,China thanked New Zealand for leading the SWG. This year it had repeatedly mentioned that it cannot agree to the proposed TRP. Time at this meeting was limited and China was focused on the tropical tuna bridging measure. It was premature for China to accept the FFA Members’ TRP proposal.
WCPFC14,179,Chinese Taipei thanked the FFA Members for their proposal but it aligned itself with the comments from China. Next year the Commission would have the South Pacific albacore stock 36 assessment and SC14 would provide advice on harvest control rules so it believed a decision on a TRP was premature. A cautious approach should be taken and the Commission should defer the adoption of a TRP to the next meeting.
WCPFC14,180,"Fiji expressed disagreement with the position of China and Chinese Taipei for the Commission to wait another year before considering a TRP. It urged that the Commission could not afford to play the waiting game on this issue anymore. A clear workplan and harvest strategy had been provided in the proposal with a modest timeframe set out to achieve the target, all with a view to achieving consensus – cuts were not being asked to be taken immediately. It reiterated the overwhelming support for adopting a South Pacific albacore TRP at this meeting, and noted its intention to propose a vote on this matter.  Given the economic importance of the southern longline fisheries to many Pacific Island countries and territories, the Commission could not wait any longer to take a decision on this matter."
WCPFC14,181,"A majority of CCMs confirmed their support for the adoption of a TRP and acknowledged that the adoption of a TRP and further progress on the harvest strategy for South Pacific albacore was very important.  Some CCMs expressed disappointment and concern that not adopting a TRP at this meeting could be an excuse for further delay, affecting the financial sustainability of the fishery, particularly for SIDS and participating territories."
WCPFC14,182,"WWF presented a statement on behalf of WWF, Environmental Defense Fund, PITIA and Greenpeace.  They concurred with Fiji’s recollection of past discussions, and confirmed that for years the aforementioned organisations had listened to impassioned pleas from numerous Pacific Islands States and territories with respect to falling catch rates for South Pacific albacore and yet only a few CCMs seem uninterested in fulfilling their responsibilities as members of this Commission and as global citizens.  They explained that despite the impassioned pleas and the voluminous information put before the Commission outlining the scientific and economic basis for a TRP, these few CCMs just don’t seem to care. They inferred that the actions by these CCMs implied a lack of care for the communities of the Pacific that are dependent on these fisheries resources, and moreover a lack of care for ensuring the health of the resource. They commended the enormous efforts made by CCMs who have been working to achieve compromise, and questioned the spirit of compromise of the other CCMs who had taken the position of waiting for the next meeting or the next stock assessment before being ready to agree to a TRP. They expressed concern that the argument to delay the adoption of a TRP was a delay tactic, to further delay management action.  They asked the CCMs that were not in a position to adopt a TRP, to confirm exactly what additional scientific evidence they would need before being ready to take a decision. Lastly it was noted that for some of the parties involved in this discussion, this was a circumstance of their own making – despite there being capacity limits in place for these fisheries for many years, some CCMs have continued to allow the number of longline fishing vessels to increase and it should not be surprising that the number of vessels will need to decrease sometime in the future."
WCPFC14,183,"The Chair noted that at some point in this discussion the Commission needed to make a decision and that one Member had called for a vote and sought clarification on the views of other Members on this question specifically. After an initial discussion on this question, the Chair requested guidance from the Legal Advisor on the Rules of Procedures of the Commission for matters that need to be taken to a vote."
WCPFC14,184,"The Legal Advisor, Dr Penny Ridings, referred members to Article 10 of the Convention.  Article 10 (4) states “The Commission may adopt decisions relating to the allocation of the total allowable catch or the total level of fishing effort.  Such decisions, including decisions relating to the exclusion of vessel types, shall be taken by consensus.”  So, the question here, is whether the establishment of a TRP fits within the phrase of Article 10 (4)?  The Legal Advisor then noted her assessment was that the establishment of a TRP does not directly relate to the allocation of a total allowable catch, neither does it relate to the allocation of a total level of fishing effort.  Her assessment was that the adoption of a TRP for south Pacific albacore does not need to be taken by consensus.  37 Rather it is a decision that falls under the decision-making procedures of Article 20, where if all efforts to reach consensus have failed, voting could be taken which would require ¾ majority in each chamber.  The procedures for undertaking a vote were outlined, confirming that a Member must call for a vote, and the Chair must set a time for a vote.  It was emphasised that the Chair must be of the view that all efforts to reach consensus have been exhausted.  It is also a requirement under our rules that delegations have credentials and that those Members who wish to participate in voting must have their credentials with the Secretariat.  The Legal Advisor suggested that the first matter to be decided should be whether the Chair was of the view that all efforts to reach consensus had been exhausted."
WCPFC14,185,"In light of the Legal Advisor’s interpretation, a discussion on the way forward ensued.  Some CCMs expressed that they saw some linkage between the TRP and a decision on total allowable catch and/or allocation and indicated they had discomfort with taking a vote on a TRP proposal at this meeting.  Other CCMs expressed that the TRP would set a long-term target for the fishery that would contribute to the overall management framework that might include a total allowable catch, but the TRP did not mandate the Commission to adopt a total allowable catch.  The TRP certainly would not drive allocation, which would need to take into account the factors of Article 10 (3) of the Convention.  Irrespective of their views on the interpretation of whether Article 10 (4) of the Convention applied, most CCMs confirmed their preference for a decision to be taken on a TRP by consensus where possible."
WCPFC14,186,"The Legal Advisor provided a supplementary comment on the background to the negotiation of Article 10 (4) of the Convention.  There were two sides to the debate during the Multilateral High Level Conference (MHLC): one group thought all decisions should be by consensus and another thought that decisions could be by some form of majority.  In the end, it was agreed that those decisions that directly affected the economic viability of the fishing industries of Members would be taken by consensus, as well as those that affected the financial contribution of Commission Members.  That was why Article 10 (4) of the Convention was limited to the matters of total allowable catch and total allowable effort, and why the budget must be agreed by consensus.  If the scope of Article 10 (4) of the Convention was now expanded beyond what was intended at the time to something such as a TRP, it would mean that a lot more decisions of the Commission would need to be taken by consensus.  This would not be consistent with the intention of the negotiators at MHLC.  The purpose of a TRP is to be a goal to be met, it does not deal with allocation as such.  However, if the result of the establishment of a TRP is that there are limits set and allocations within the overall limit, then these would be matters that would be subject to Article 10 (4)."
WCPFC14,187,"The Chair suggested that discussion be suspended so she could have some time to further consult with concerned CCMs during a short break. Following informal consultations with some delegations, the Chair updated the Commission that compromise language had been developed that the Commission should be able to agree to by consensus and avoid the call for a vote. The meeting was asked in reviewing the draft language to consider that strong language was necessary to satisfy the concerns that a number of CCMs had of not being able to adopt a TRP at this meeting. The two Members that had been opposed to adoption of a TRPs this year had committed to adopt a TRP at WCPFC15."
WCPFC14,188,"The Commission agreed to prioritise the development and adoption of a Target Reference Point for South Pacific albacore through the following actions:  a. All CCMs with an interest in the Southern albacore fishery jointly commit to review available scientific and economic information to inform their position about appropriate goals for the fishery and corresponding candidate target reference points; 38 b. Regardless of the results of the 2018 stock assessment and the management advice from SC14 to WCPFC15, SC14 shall dedicate sufficient time in the Management Issues Theme to develop advice for WCPFC15 on candidate target reference points c. CCMs will work together in advance of WCPFC15 to develop TRP proposals; and d. WCPFC15 shall adopt a Target Reference Point for South Pacific albacore.    6.5 Harvest control rules (South Pacific albacore tuna and skipjack tuna)"
WCPFC14,189,The Commission deferred consideration of this item to Agenda Item 6.9 - Review of the Workplan.  6.6 Management strategy evaluation (South Pacific albacore tuna and skipjack tuna)
WCPFC14,190,The Commission deferred discussion of this item to Agenda Item 6.9 - Review of the Workplan.  6.7 Monitoring Strategy and Performance Indicators (all stocks/fisheries)
WCPFC14,191,The United States noted that it had posted a proposed revision to the performance indicators for the tropical Tuna longline fishery in WCPFC14-2017-DP30 Performance Indicators and Monitoring Strategies for Bigeye and Yellowfin Tuna Compatible with Candidate Management Objectives for the Tropical Longline Fishery. It proposed an additional indicator of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).
WCPFC14,192,The Commission was invited to note the candidate performance indicators and monitoring strategies for the tropical longline fishery and provide advice on what performance indicators and monitoring strategies should be included for this fishery for the development of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-06.
WCPFC14,193,"The European Union supported this discussion but asked that this indicator apply to the purse seine fishery too. In response, the United States clarified that there was already an indicator in the purse seine fishery that was very similar to this."
WCPFC14,194,Japan confirmed their support for the US proposal in DP30.
WCPFC14,195,"Tuvalu noted that FFA Members supported the recommendations from SC13 that the candidate lists of performance indicators and monitoring strategies for the Southern and Tropical Longline Fisheries be noted. While FFA Members supported the work SPC had done to develop the performance indicators on the basis of the MOW2 strawman paper, they were concerned that the Commission and its subsidiary bodies had not been allowed enough time to engage in the development of the various elements of the harvest strategy. The small working group at SC13 had very limited time to consider a long list of performance indicators and monitoring strategies before the list came to the Commission for the consideration of fisheries managers. There was simply not sufficient time to engage in refining and prioritising the long lists contained in the SC information papers and as a result FFA Members had no choice but to simply note these papers, on the understanding that there is a list of candidate performance indicators which may be used as appropriate as the harvest strategies evolve."
WCPFC14,196,"The Chair agreed it was important to clarify that in WCPFC14-2017-DP30 the United States was only proposing that WCPFC14 note the candidate indicators, not adopt them at this meeting. More time will be needed to get to a point where these indicators could be recorded and then adopted.  39"
WCPFC14,197,"The Commission noted the SC13 advice that in the short-term it was seen as best practice to support a broad range of performance indicators in support of the multiple management objectives already identified by the Commission. However, SC13 noted that there will be scope to iteratively refine both the management objectives and related performance indicators and monitoring strategies in light of the outcomes of the current Harvest Strategy Work Plan and the development of the management framework within the WCPFC."
WCPFC14,198,"The Commission noted the candidate performance indicators and monitoring strategies for south Pacific albacore commensurate with candidate management objectives for the Southern Longline Fishery to be considered in the development of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-06 (Attachment K, Table 1)."
WCPFC14,199,"The Commission noted the candidate performance indicators and monitoring strategies for bigeye and yellowfin tuna commensurate with candidate management objectives for the Tropical Longline Fishery to be considered in the development of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-06 (Attachment K, Table 2). 6.8 Harvest Strategy for Pacific bluefin tuna and North Pacific albacore"
WCPFC14,200,"The NC Vice-Chair Mr Michael Tosatto (United States) provided an update on the status of the harvest strategy workplan for the Pacific bluefin tuna. A 2nd Joint IATTC-WCPFC NC Working Group on Pacific Bluefin Management was held, which reviewed the current CMM, emergency rule and catch documentation scheme. It also addressed the second rebuilding target and timeline and long-term precautionary approach. The Northern Committee had developed four harvest strategies which were targeted. Because an interim CMM already existed with an initial rebuilding target, a second rebuilding target was established, alongside a recruitment scenario with the help of International Scientific Committee (ISC) and a monitoring strategy to ensure the initial target was met by 2024. A number of rebuilding targets and a performance evaluation had been put in place with the assistance of the ISC. A short paper on development of the catch documentation scheme was included in Attachment E of NC13 Summary Report, and harvest strategy information was included in Attachment F. NC13’s key recommendation was: “NC13 recommends that the Commission adopt the Harvest Strategy for Pacific Bluefin Tuna Fisheries (Attachment F), and recommends that the Commission direct the Secretariat to make this harvest strategy available, as a stand alone harvest strategy document, on a web page dedicated to this and other harvest strategies, including interim harvest strategies, adopted by the Commission”."
WCPFC14,201,New Zealand noted that it and other FFA Members had been highly critical at the last two Commission meetings of the lack of progress on the proposed harvest strategy for Pacific bluefin tuna. It congratulated the Northern Committee for their work and generally supported the proposed way forward.
WCPFC14,202,"Pew Charitable Trust, on behalf of Pew Charitable Trust, Greenpeace and WWF, recognised the work of the NC and the joint working group in finding agreement on a harvest strategy for Pacific bluefin tuna. This work was vital if the stock was to recover from its current dire state – which was currently at just 2.6% of its historic size. The adoption of the harvest strategy was just the first minimum step in rebuilding Pacific bluefin. The Commission must ensure that provisions of the Harvest Strategy workplan and CMM 2014-06 are fully carried out, especially in respect to catch limits. These organisations were strongly concerned that limits have been exceeded in recent years and that there were indications that this situation may reoccur this year. These overages threaten the success of the 40 rebuilding plan, just as it was in the beginning and given the status of the stock it was vital any catches in excess of the quotas be paid back by those States responsible. As a first step, they asked the Commission to increase transparency and accountability by clearly publishing the annual quota for Pacific bluefin in metric tonnage for each member, either in the Annual meeting report or in the tables already provided by the Secretariat. And second, the Commission commit to making progress in designing and implementing a robust electronic Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS)."
WCPFC14,203,The European Union noted that it had been very critical in the past on the way this stock had being managed and it was pleased to see there was a significant change in that approach. It was pleased the Commission was now moving in the right direction for the recovery of this stock.
WCPFC14,204,"The NC Vice-Chair also provided an update on the status of the harvest strategy work plan for North Pacific albacore.  “NC13 recommends that the Commission adopt the attached revision to the title of the previously adopted Precautionary Management Framework for North Pacific albacore (Attachment H), so that it may be recognized as a Harvest Strategy. In addition, NC13 recommends that the Commission direct the Secretariat to make this harvest strategy available, as a stand alone harvest strategy document, on a web page dedicated to this and other harvest strategies, including interim harvest strategies, adopted by the Commission.”"
WCPFC14,205,"The NC Vice-Chair, in response to a request for clarification about why the limit reference point was being titled as interim, confirmed that the limit reference point was established at 20%, so was not considered to be interim. However, “interim” as used in this context because it refers to the harvest strategy containing management objectives, target reference points and harvest control rules elements that are considered at this stage to be “interim”."
WCPFC14,206,"The Commission adopted the Interim Harvest Strategy for North Pacific Albacore Fisheries (NC13 Summary Report, Attachment H, Attachment I), noting that it modifies and replaces the previously adopted precautionary management framework for North Pacific albacore and is to be recognised as a harvest strategy."
WCPFC14,207,"The Commission adopted the Harvest Strategy for Pacific Bluefin Tuna Fisheries (NC13 Summary Report Attachment F, Attachment J)."
WCPFC14,208,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat to develop a dedicated space on the WCPFC website for publishing of harvest strategies, including interim harvest strategies, agreed to by the Commission. 6.9 Review of Work Plan"
WCPFC14,209,Australia throughout the WCPFC14 meeting consulted with interested CCMs and developed a revised draft of the Harvest Strategy Workplan. Some suggested changes to the workplan for CCMs to consider included: 1) extending the current Workplan out to 2021 to allow for the ongoing work towards adoption of harvest strategies for the 4 key stocks; 2) reframing the work on bigeye and yellowfin tuna given the recent scientific advice for the status of bigeye from rebuilding to developing a target reference point; 3) proposing a dedicated discussion in 2018 by SC and the Commission of management objectives in terms of candidate target reference points for bigeye and yellowfin. Key changes were deferring the 2017 South Pacific albacore TRP decision until 2018 and editing 2017 items to reflect the actual activities and decisions of the WCPFC14 and its subsidiary bodies during 2017. 41
WCPFC14,210,The United States supported the changes documented in Rev2 and thanked Australia for accommodating its proposed suggestions.
WCPFC14,211,Japan pointed out a small correction still to be made in Rev2.  Edits were made on-screen to modify the 2019 Workplan to include a review of TRP for skipjack in 2019 as per CMM 2015-06.
WCPFC14,212,"The Chair, on behalf of the Commission, thanked Australia for their efforts to develop a revised Workplan for adoption."
WCPFC14,213,The Commission adopted the Updated Workplan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 (Attachment L). The Secretariat was tasked with including text to document progress achieved in 2017 under the WCPFC14 Harvest Strategies agenda items.
WCPFC14,214,The Commission recognized the importance of developing harvest strategies for key stocks in the WCPO. The Commission recognized that this work requires the consideration of fisheries managers and scientists at different stages. The Commission notes that the time required for harvest strategy discussions is substantial but will also vary from year to year and the Commission recognized the need for this to be accommodated.
WCPFC14,215,"The Commission agreed to reprioritise as needed the annual agenda of the Commission and Scientific Committee to allow sufficient additional time for consideration of harvest strategy issues. In addition, WCPFC recognised that there may also be a need for a dedicated science/management dialogue. AGENDA ITEM 7 – WCPO TUNA STOCKS 7.1 General overview of stock status (bigeye tuna, Pacific bluefin tuna, skipjack tuna, North Pacific albacore, South Pacific albacore, and yellowfin tuna.)"
WCPFC14,216,"The Chair noted that during the Second Intersessional Meeting to Progress the Draft Bridging Measure for Tropical Tunas (SS3) held on 1 December 2017, the Commission had received a detailed presentation from SPC on the scientific evaluation of the management options requested by the August Intersessional meeting held in Hawaii (WCPFC14-2017-10_rev1 ‘An Evaluation of the Management options for purse seine and longline fisheries defined by the TT CMM Intersessional meeting - revision 1)’, as well as a general overview of the status of stocks for bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin. At the one-day intersessional meeting to progress the draft bridging measure for South Pacific albacore, members also received an overview presentation of the stock status of South Pacific albacore from SPC. The Commission was also referred to the SC13 Summary Report (WCPFC14-2017-SC13) and WCPFC14-2017-IP13 on ‘The western and central Pacific tuna fishery: 2016 Overview and status of stocks’ for further information. The Chair proposed that in order to have more time for the substantive discussions and because both of the one-day intersessional meetings on the draft Bridging Measure for Tropical Tunas and the draft Bridging Measure for South Pacific albacore had just recently met, the SPC would not make a presentation on the general stock overview for bigeye, skipjack, South Pacific albacore and yellowfin."
WCPFC14,217,"The ISC Chairman Gerard DiNardo presented an overview of the ISC’s recent stock assessments on the North Pacific albacore and North Pacific blue shark. The North Pacific albacore stock was likely not overfished and overfishing was likely not occurring. If constant fishing intensity was applied to the stock, median female spawning biomass was expected to undergo a moderate decline with a <0.01% probability of falling below the WCPFC established LRP by 2025. However, expected 42 catches in this scenario would be below the recent average catch level for this stock. North Pacific blue shark was not overfished and overfishing was not occurring. Projections under a different fishing mortality harvest policy show that median blue shark spawning biomass in the North Pacific Ocean would likely remain above SSBMSY in the foreseeable future (2024).  Future activities of ISC include a mako shark aging workshop; ISC MSE Albacore workshop; an ad-hoc working group to develop an international north Pacific highly migratory species tagging programme with an initial focus on Pacific bluefin and North Pacific albacore; ISC initiated Pacific bluefin tuna MSE in 2018 which would provide resources, reference points, HCR, and management strategies by 2019. This was a major undertaking and agreement from NC13 to move work on Pacific bluefin tuna forward. Stock assessments to be finished by July 2018, including an updated Pacific bluefin stock assessment; a north Pacific shortfin mako shark stock assessment; and a north Pacific swordfish benchmark stock assessment. There would also be a number of additional scientific meetings/ workshops in 2018. He further noted the upcoming leadership changes at ISC. John Holmes (Canada) was elected as incumbent ISC Chair, and Shui-Kai (Eric) Chang (Chinese Taipei) was elected as ISC Vice-Chair. ISC18 would be held in Korea between 11-18 July 2018, and delegates were reminded that requests to ISC needed to be made via written letter to the Chair."
WCPFC14,218,"Canada thanked Gerard DiNardo for the presentation and acknowledged the contribution he had made to the Northern Committee and the Commission in general.  In respect of North Pacific albacore, it noted the absence of a target reference point, which is a key component of the management strategy process, and for this reason Canada hosted a workshop in Vancouver in 2017 and hopes to see the adoption of target reference point in 2018.   7.2 Draft Bridging CMM on Tropical Tunas (bigeye, skipjack, yellowfin)"
WCPFC14,219,"The Chair advised the meeting that the Second Intersessional Meeting to Progress the Draft Bridging Measure for Tropical Tunas was held immediately prior to WCPFC14 on Friday 1 December 2017. The primary document considered at that meeting was Rev5 of the Chair’s Consultative Draft on the Tropical Tuna Bridging CMM – Circular 2017/65 WCPFC14-2017-08, and the two supplements that were issued containing delegation proposals that had been submitted to WCPFC14 (WCPFC14-2017-08_suppl1 and WCPFC14-2017-08_suppl2). It was noted that SPC also provided a detailed presentation of An Evaluation of the Management options for purse seine and longline fisheries defined by the TT CMM Intersessional meeting – revision 1 SPC-OFP WCPFC14-2017-10_rev1.  Other documents and information papers were taken as read."
WCPFC14,220,"Since the conclusion of the intersessional meeting, the Chair produced a revised draft bridging measure contained at WCPFC14-2017-30 Draft Bridging CMM on Tropical Tunas – Chair’s draft.  The Chair explained that the draft had been prepared with the assistance of the Secretariat, including SPC-OFP, to reflect CCM proposals and feedback over the last seventeen months. It was provided in two forms: A clean version (WCPFC14-2017-30), with paragraph numbering largely reflecting Rev5 text and a tracked version (WCPFC14-2017-30A) showing amendments to the text of Rev5. This draft was noted to be a combination of measures that the Chair considered as having the best prospect of enabling the Commission to reach consensus. These measures reflect what the Chair considered to be a reasonable balance between the varying viewpoints, including on the issue of disproportionate burden. The Chair explained that no CCM will see everything it wanted in this draft but believed that each CCM would see some of what they wanted, which goes to the heart of the consensus model. The Chair then briefly introduced the newly revised text section by section and provided the rationale for certain key provisions."
WCPFC14,221,"Dr John Hampton presented the SPC’s assessment of the impact of the proposed measures contained in the Chair’s Draft on a range of key factors, including: maintenance of stock biomass at healthy levels; the level of fishing mortality; and the risk of breaching the Limit Reference Point.  An 43 updated version of the SPC assessment was subsequently issued on 3 December as WCPFC14-2017-30B.  The explanatory note that accompanied SPC’s evaluation of the Chair’s Draft stated: This draft measure, as evaluated, allows a 9% increase in purse seine associate effort and an 11% increase in longline bigeye catch, relative to 2013-2015 baseline levels. If implemented over 30 years, adult biomass relative to unfished levels (SB/SBF=0) is predicted to decline from 0.32 (recent assessed levels) to 0.29, a decline of 10% (relative SB/SBF=0 = 0.9). Fishing mortality is predicted to increase by 19% (relative F/Fmsy = 1.19) to just below the Fmsy level (F/Fmsy = 0.99). The risk of breaching the LRP is greater than 20% (actual approximated level = 29%). This risk is conditional on the currently-used uncertainty framework as adopted by SC13, i.e. a model ensemble consisting of 72 weighted models including both the ‘old’ and ‘new’ growth scenarios. Further work has been requested by SC13 which may result in changes to the model ensemble and therefore to the uncertainty framework and risks associated with this draft measure."
WCPFC14,222,The Commission agreed to consider in detail the provisions of the Chair’s Draft in a SWG led by the Chair. The Chair continued to update the plenary as negotiations of the Chair’s Draft progressed. Some of the sessions of the SWG were held with limited participation to a select number of representatives from Members and Participating Territories including for some sessions Heads of Delegations only.
WCPFC14,223,"Pew Charitable Trusts, on behalf of Pew Charitable Trust, Environmental Defense Fund, ISSF, Greenpeace, Sustainable Fisheries Partnership and WWF delivered a statement on tropical tunas and in response to Chair’s Draft Bridging Measure on Tropical Tunas.  The organisations expressed that they were encouraged by the increased spirit of negotiation toward agreement on the tropical tuna measure, and the discussions during the intersessional meeting on Friday 1 December that confirmed that the current levels of catch and effort in purse seine and longline fisheries are appropriate.  They also appreciated the work that was undertaken to provide the new text contained in the Chair’s Draft.  The organisations pointed out that WCPFC members have agreed to apply the precautionary approach and the Commission should not agree to a measure for tropical tunas that does not meet scientific advice.  They expressed concern that the current formulation of measures in the Chair’s Draft would result in an increase in both purse seine FAD effort and longline bigeye catch.  While there remains significant uncertainty with the bigeye stock status, the current best estimates indicate that at these levels there is a 29% risk of breaching the limit reference point.  This risk is both higher than the Commission agreed risk of breaching the LRP of being at a level of between 0 – 20% and is inconsistent with the UN Fish Stock Agreement language that the risk of breaching a limit reference point should be very low.  The proposed effort levels in the Chair’s Draft would also not be consistent with scientific advice for bigeye.  The organisations further called on WCPFC to further refine this proposed measure so that it meets the interim decisions that have already been made and the scientific advice."
WCPFC14,224,"WWF requested that in the interests of transparency, the NGO community be allowed to attend the SWG sessions on tropical tunas, given the expanded representation from Heads of Delegation, only, to two per delegation from Members and Participating Territories."
WCPFC14,225,"The Commission considered this request, but noting that since at least one Member had indicated a preference for a HOD-only SWG session, the request from WWF could not be supported.  An idea was put forth that two persons be allowed to represent all the concerned NGOs"
WCPFC14,226,"Pew Charitable Trusts expressed their concern that the core business of the Commission was not going to be conducted in a transparent process and it was unclear what great fears there were from having NGOs as part of these processes.  It expressed the view that the Civil Society Organisations 44 who contribute significant financial resources to support the work of the Commission were the only group that was not being provided an opportunity to participate in the SWG.  It further expressed disappointment that the approach of this Commission every time things get hard, was to close down transparency.  It strongly encouraged the Commission to consider that a single representative per observer delegation is a reasonable level of observer participation.  It further expressed that it was unacceptable for the Commission to consider asking observer organisations to choose two representatives to represent all observers.  The Commission was asked to further consider these points in the spirit of cooperation in which this Commission is meant to function."
WCPFC14,227,The Chair provided an update on the SWG sessions and confirmed that the discussions were constructive and good progress was made although further work needs to be done.  The Chair suggested that the next meeting of the SWG would be an open SWG format to consider the full draft text.
WCPFC14,228,The United States noted that there remained some issues that would benefit from a Heads of Delegation only discussion before the draft CMM could suitably be considered paragraph by paragraph in an open working group session.
WCPFC14,229,"Australia on behalf of FFA Members, thanked the Chair for her efforts to lead a process that would result in a revised measure for tropical tuna. It also thanked all delegations that participated in a collegial manner in the same pursuit. FFA Members entered discussions with the intention of retaining the full package of 2017 measures. Without rehashing specifics, the three bases for that position were: 1) that it responded to the scientific advice, which indicated a likelihood that such measures would maintain the stock at recent levels but with some risk of declines even below the LRP; 2) that it responded to the precautionary approach by waiting until the Commission was confident in the new science before removing management measures; and 3) that it responded to the need to avoid disproportionate burden on SIDS and Territories. It therefore seemed like a win-win to FFA Members. However, they quickly learned that this would not be possible and heard various proposals to relax every component of the measure – FAD closures, purse seine effort limits and longline catch limits. FFA Members viewed the package of measures that has evolved through the various discussions as a reasonable compromise. While not as strong as the 2017 measures, they felt that it did pay adequate attention to the three bases outlined above. FFA Members thank all delegations that have been engaged in difficult negotiations to arrive at that package. They advised that they were ready to support it. There were many other elements in the revised measure that had not been able to get attention, so FFA Members suggested that the Commission agree to the main components in principle now so the remaining details of the package could be finalised."
WCPFC14,230,"The Republic of Korea spoke in response to the United States suggestion for a Heads of Delegation only discussion on the draft bridging measure.  It indicated a preference to have two representatives per Member delegation, or otherwise an open SWG."
WCPFC14,231,"China expressed to the meeting their feeling that the meeting was very close to consensus.  It indicated comfort with either the United States request for a Heads of Delegation only SWG or the Koreas alternative of Heads of Delegation + one, with a view to furthering progress on the significant matters that remained unresolved."
WCPFC14,232,"Japan thanked CCMs for their efforts to progress the draft bridging measure thus far. Since the Commission adopted CMM 2008-01, Japan has been implementing the tropical tuna measures faithfully.  It scrapped 87 longline vessels to comply with catch limits in 2009, and longline catch of bigeye tuna has decreased by more than 50% between 2004 and 2016.  The number of FAD sets has also been decreased by more than 70% between 2004 and 2016.  Despite these tremendous efforts, things are not getting better around Japanese waters.  Catches of skipjack and bigeye have been dwindling in the last decade, and this has had serious impacts on Japanese fishermen particularly coastal small-scale fishermen.  The situation is particularly bad for skipjack, and migration to the 45 western coast of Japan has almost disappeared.  This phenomenon negatively affects not only fishermen, but also cultural activities in such a way that traditional festivals to celebrate seasonal catches of skipjack are frequently cancelled.  Referring to paragraph 7 of CMM 2015-06, the Commission is to consider and pay particular attention to any future recommendations of the Scientific Committee relating to the target reference point, including any recommendations with respect to potential spatial impacts of fishing on the stock, including possible local depletion or range contraction.  It noted that it is a fact that catches of skipjack in the area north of 20N have been decreasing, while purse seine capacity and the catches of skipjack in the tropical area have been drastically increasing.  Considering the outcomes from the SC13 meeting for skipjack, Japan expressed its view that there is a strong relationship between poor catches of skipjack in its waters and increased catches of skipjack by purse seiners in the tropical area.  In respect of bigeye tuna, the scientific advice is very clear.  The SC13 advises that the fishing mortality of bigeye tuna should not be increased from current level. Japan also noted that additional analysis conducted by SPC demonstrates that strengthening of the current measures would be required to keep the probability of breaching Blimit at no less than 20%.   Japan also reiterated that the first intersessional meeting in Honolulu agreed that the spawning biomass depletion ratio (SB/SBF=0) is to be maintained at or above the average SB/SBF=0 for 2012-2015.   It expressed its concern that some members had taken positions during the negotiations that seek to weaken the measures, and noted that only Japan had provided proposals to strengthen the measures.  Finally, Japan reiterated its commitment to continue to participate in the SWG and asked that all CCMs continue to participate in the spirit of cooperation."
WCPFC14,233,"The European Union thanked the Chair for her efforts to progress negotiations towards consensus and observed that positions were still divergent. It regretted that discussions were not taken in open session so observers could see with their own eyes the discussions on the bridging measure. Whilst it preferred to have all discussions in open SWG session, however recognising that this might be problematic for some delegations at this point in the discussions, it might be easier to reach consensus through further discussions in the closed session as proposed by the United States.  The European Union remained committed to working with other delegations towards consensus, noting that it would be very regrettable if this meeting was not able to agree to a robust conservation and management measure for tropical tunas."
WCPFC14,234,"The Republic of Marshall Islands, speaking as PNA Chair thanked the Chair for her extraordinary efforts and that of the Secretariat staff, to secure a positive outcome at this point in the development of a Bridging Measure for Tropical Tunas. PNA Members thanked all the other Members that had worked hard in the same direction and the NGOs that contributed. They thanked SPC for their very hard work and great skill and also acknowledged the very prominent and positive role played by Japan throughout these negotiations working closely with PNA and FFA members. PNA Members mentioned they already shared their intention of retaining the full package of 2017 measures based on the SPC analysis of options that indicated no room to increase effort for skipjack, and there was no room to ease the measures that were in place for bigeye. That conclusion was precisely consistent with the advice of the Scientific Committee.  In the spirit of compromise and on the basis that this was a bridging measure, PNA Members supported the Chair’s efforts to find an overlap of understanding with Members that hold a different view. PNA members took some comfort from the knowledge that there would be further work by the Scientific Committee on the bigeye assessment that should reduce uncertainty and would probably be more positive. But it might not, and there was no need to rush. The tropical tuna management regime that was in place was the most effective in the world. This was the only tuna RFMO where all three major tropical tuna stocks were in the green and fished sustainably. This was also the only oceanic region where most of the catch in the purse seine fishery was taken on free schools not FADs. PNA Members saw no good reason for delegates to leave this meeting without some form of arrangement in place to manage the tropical tunas. None felt more deeply about this than small island states whose communities were so dependent on these resources and remained committed to all efforts to ensure that these stocks are effectively managed and conserved.  46"
WCPFC14,235,"Papua New Guinea acknowledged that much progress had been achieved with the negotiations of the Draft Measures for Tropical Tunas in the closed sessions of the SWG. PNG like other PNA and FFA members expected this meeting to successful completion the negotiations of the tropical tuna measure which has spanned over the last few years. PNG was of the view that failure to agree on a measure would reflect adversely on the integrity of the Commission on the international level. PNG came with a great degree of flexibility on certain issues and were ready to compromise on the basis that their approach would create mutual benefits. It reminded developed CCMs that it looked forward to a revised measure that was accommodative of their shared objectives to enhance development priorities. On FAD closure, PNG expressed its concern about the huge disproportional burden it carried as a SIDS that was both a flag state and coastal state with the largest population and with an industry to protect. At the same time, it was mindful of available scientific advice to conserve the resource for future generations. For this reason, it was ready and willing to continue to carry the conservation burden of the three months FAD closure in its zone. However, it could not continue with the fourth month again and vowed to share this burden with everyone seated here. PNG represented eight million citizens and its Pacific brother and sisters. It asked developed powerful nations to take into consideration the plight that they put SIDS in when refusing to adopt such measures, such as this draft measure.  PNG supported more controls placed on high seas in terms of purse seine effort limits, FAD closures and longline limits as this was the Commission’s responsibility. However, at this Commission it was disappointing to hear developed nations using the vulnerabilities of their territories to block consensus on this issue. These territories could not be compared with SIDS independent sovereign nations. Based on the negotiations so far, SIDS were now taking a back seat while developed nations discussed how to regulate their waters. This included, refusing to agree on the timeframe for the FAD closure and refusing to agree on a limit for longline vessels. PNG acknowledged all the hard work put into negotiating this measure and encouraged some CCMs to rethink their positions to arrive at an agreement that did not put the reputation and integrity of this Commission into question. It was critical to safeguard this vital resource for future generations."
WCPFC14,236,"The United States expressed concern about the coverage of hard negotiation positions in the media which needed to be avoided if consensus was to be reached and it was on that basis that it supported a closed session. It explained that data from SPC demonstrated that if the fishery continues to fish bigeye tuna the same way as today, then there would not be a problem with the stock. The problem, the United States noted, was sending real fisherman that fish today home in order to achieve a theoretical longline catch of 18,000MT in the future. Aspirational goals that could not be caught and latent effort was being used to constrain stock. The United States mentioned that progress on a bridging measure could not be made without resolving these issues. The United States said it put forward proposal after proposal that kept getting rejected because some Members wanted to retain their rights to catch fish in the future. It was an issue of aspirational rights verses sovereign rights of SIDS and fishing nations. The United States reiterated its request to go to a closed SWG session to resolve these difficult issues, and suggested that the current direction may lead to a lack of consensus."
WCPFC14,237,"Japan confirmed that it had intended to keep its comments of a general nature.  However, the nature of the United States comment seemed to imply that those flag CCMs who had not met their bigeye longline catches in past years were the ones looking to break consensus, and that was misleading, particularly to those who were outside the Heads of Delegation meetings.  On the contrary, it pointed out that its delegation had been giving concessions for those Members, such as United States and China who had exceeded or fully utilised their high seas allocations in recent years.  It noted that Japan was a delegation that had put forward proposals during the SWG with a view to accommodating those CCMs interests.  It clarified that the outstanding issue in the SWG was high seas FAD closure not bigeye longline catch limits."
WCPFC14,238,The final plenary consideration of the draft measure for tropical tunas considered four key issues as documented in the succeeding paragraphs.  47
WCPFC14,239,"The first key issue was the special arrangements contained in the draft measure to accommodate the concerns of the United States.  Two specific provisions were negotiated to cater for these concerns and the language that was subsequently agreed are contained in paragraph 9 and paragraph 29 of CMM 2017-01 that state:  9. For purposes of paragraphs 39-41 and 45-49, catches and effort of United States flagged vessels operating under agreements with its Participating Territories shall be attributed to the Participating Territories.  Such agreements shall be notified to the Commission in the form of notification under CMM 2016-05 or its replacement.  Attribution for the purpose of this Measure is without prejudice to attribution for the purposes of establishing rights and allocation. 29. To alleviate the economic hardship of American Samoa particularly its canneries, and for the 2018 year only, the United States may transfer 100 vessel days from the effort limits established for its EEZ, and notified to the Commission, to its high seas effort limit set out in Attachment 1, Table 2.  The United States shall notify the Secretariat quarterly of the utilisation of its EEZ limits.  If by October 1 2018, the United States has reached its EEZ effort limit, its EEZ effort limit will be increased by 100 vessel days, with the expectation that the catch taken by United States flagged purse seine vessels and landed in American Samoa for the American Samoa canneries is no less than the volume landed in 2017 increased by 3,500 short tonnes.  The United States shall endeavour to ensure that its purse seine vessels do not use any increased high seas effort in the high seas west of 180 degrees.  The United States shall provide information to WCPFC15 on the implementation of this paragraph.  Upon request this arrangement may be re-examined by the Commission at WCPFC15. This arrangement shall not constitute a precedent for the future."
WCPFC14,240,"The United States, in respect of the paragraph 9 of CMM 2017-01, delivered the following statement: “As the Commission knows, since 2011 the United States has authorized and reported to the Commission the allocation of bigeye longline limits identified under contracts between our three United States Participating Territories and eligible permit holders based in Hawaii. These allocations are annually reported as United States Participating Territory longline catch and are helping our Participating Territories to achieve their aspirational goals for responsible fisheries development. In addition, these limited allocations have been approved only after a rigorous public process that includes an environmental analysis to ensure consistency with United States law and Commission decisions. We understand and appreciate the Commission’s recognition of these agreements in paragraph 9 of CMM 2017-01.”"
WCPFC14,241,"The Chair, in respect of paragraph 29 of CMM 2017-01, noted that the formulation of this paragraph in the draft measure had occurred during the special Heads of Delegation discussion.  Given that the paragraph related to the United States, the Chair asked the United States to explain the proposed provision and its intent."
WCPFC14,242,"The United States expressed its sincere thanks to all the Members who worked with it on developing this provision.  It explained that significant consultations had taken place over the course of the negotiations, and expressed its hope that the formulation in the draft measure could be agreed at this meeting.  American Samoa is a central hub and provides a range of services, including fuel and other services, in support of purse seine operations in the Pacific Ocean.  It was noted that there were two tuna canneries that had operated in recent times in American Samoa but one had recently closed, and the other had needed to take a number of extended closures.  Those closures have taken an enormous toll on American Samoa revenues, and past tuna measures have been noted to have been hard for maintaining tuna supply to these canneries.  In an effort to assist the people of American 48 Samoa, the other members of the Commission were willing to make concessions, and the United States expressed appreciation for these efforts.  It explained that the formulation of paragraph 29 in the draft measure, sought to allow for some flexibility to allow United States flagged vessels the opportunity to utilise a portion of the purse seine EEZ limits within the high seas during 2018, on the proviso that it would be offloaded in American Samoa canneries.  The provision was intended to be limited to support American Samoa canneries alone, and the United States supported this intent.  It further explained that the effect of the provision, is under certain conditions there would be provision to allow the United States, for 2018 only, to transfer 100 days from its EEZ limit (totalling 558 days) to the high seas, so that overall the impact on stocks would be roughly equivalent.  If by October 2018, the United States had fully utilised its EEZ effort limit, then its EEZ limit would be increased by 100 days, with the expectation that the equivalent catch would be landed in American Samoa.  The arrangement is a short-term arrangement, and the United States accepted that this is a one-year provision that expires unless the Commission decides otherwise.  It reiterated its appreciation to the Members who had worked to finalise the provision, and expressed a hope that the paragraph could be accepted."
WCPFC14,243,"The Republic of Marshall Islands confirmed its support for the proposed language, noting that its support was on the basis that it was for the benefit of the participating territory of American Samoa. It also confirmed that the discussions related to this matter, were at times difficult.  In this instance, the interests and aspirations of Small Island Developing States in furthering economic opportunities from these tuna fisheries were noted to be “the same case”.  The concession provided in the provision is to ensure that the landings from the 100 days in question, are made in American Samoa as an offset to the hardship that has been faced by American Samoa."
WCPFC14,244,"The Cook Islands supported this proposal, noting that it was one of the coastal States with adjacent EEZ waters to the high seas east of 180W.  It confirmed that the rationale for the proposed provision was in their view quite valid."
WCPFC14,245,"American Samoa, following agreement on paragraph 29 CMM 2017-01, noted that they had come to the meeting with an urgent call for help to both Pacific Island countries as well as to distant water fishing nations.  On behalf of the Governor and people of American Samoa, it expressed its sincere thanks to the Members of the Commission for their display of fellowship by considering the needs and concerns of its people.  It expressed special thanks to the FFA and PNA members for their support to American Samoa.  It also expressed the view that the support it received during the meeting showed that the Commission was being a responsible custodian of the resource and that the participants at this meeting were leaving a legacy for the people to come."
WCPFC14,246,"The second key issue was raised by the Republic of Korea in plenary.  It noted that since the introduction of the concept of the PNA longline Vessel Day Scheme, Korea has expressed strong concern about the scheme, particularly regarding the impact of the scheme on the management of the bigeye stock, with apparent lack of certainties and predictabilities in the output. It noted its strong belief that the catch limit, which is currently implemented by the Commission is by far the most effective longline bigeye management. No matter how the PNA longline VDS system is referred to, Korea, as a Member of the Commission does not recognize the system. Korea has been holding this position for a long time and this will not change in the future.  After a lengthy discussion, the following preamble paragraph was subsequently agreed in plenary: Noting further that the Parties to the Nauru Agreement have adopted and implemented a Vessel Day Scheme for the longline fishery, a Vessel Day Scheme for the purse seine fishery and a registry for FADs in the zones of the Parties, and may establish longline effort limits, or equivalent catch limits for longline fisheries within their exclusive economic zones.  49"
WCPFC14,247,"The third key issue was raised by the Cook Islands in plenary when considering the paragraphs relating to the provisions of the measure that would not be applied to Small Island Developing States (CMM 2017-01 paragraph 5) and relating to vessels operating under charter arrangements (CMM 2017-01 paragraph 8).  The Cook Islands noted that it did not have any flagged purse seine vessels, and was concerned that the current formulation of these two paragraphs, appeared to prevent the Cook Islands from using charter arrangements as a mechanism to continue to develop its purse seine fisheries, including in the high seas.  The Cook Islands confirmed that it was unable to go along with consensus if this was a correct interpretation of these paragraphs."
WCPFC14,248,A lengthy discussion ensued where the Chair and many CCMs strongly encouraged the Cook Islands to reconsider its need to accommodate such a substantive issue at such a late stage in the negotiation. The Chair reflected that all CCMs had worked very hard at this meeting and many compromises were made to ensure that the new measure could be adopted at this meeting and that raising a substantive issue like this at such a late stage of the negotiation had the potential to derail the final outcome that CCMs had worked so hard to achieve at WCPFC14.
WCPFC14,249,"The Legal Adviser, in response to a request for interpretation of the current formulation of the paragraphs in question, noted that chartering arrangements had been designed to assist countries to develop their domestic fleets fishing within their EEZs, with the attribution of catch being to a chartering Member.  The issue here was the potential for flag State high seas purse seine limits to be circumvented through the attribution of catch of a distant water fishing nation vessel to a SIDS.  The Legal Advisor confirmed that the interpretation of the current formulation of the charter attribution provisions in the draft measure did mean that even if a SIDS chartered vessels that were flagged to a developed CCM, the catch of those vessels would remain subject to the high seas purse seine effort limits in the draft measure."
WCPFC14,250,"The Cook Islands thanked the Legal Advisor for clarifying the interpretation.  It maintained that if delegations were not willing to include the necessary modifications to the charter attribution paragraphs in the measure to provide an opportunity for all SIDS to charter purse seine vessels to fish on the high seas, and to attribute those catches to the chartering SIDS, the only alternative that the Cook Islands would be willing to consider would be to declare a purse seine effort limit that would apply to the Cook Islands EEZ and high seas waters combined of 1250 days.  Cook Islands reiterated that it was seeking a particular decision at this meeting to support the development of its domestic purse seine fisheries noting that this was linked to access by vessels fishing in its waters to high seas waters adjacent to the Cook Islands EEZ. It assured the Commission that it would only exploit the high seas within its combined high seas and EEZ limit, and that it would do so responsibly."
WCPFC14,251,"Another lengthy discussion ensued which involved a number of CCMs, in an effort to ensure a measure could be agreed, discussing a range of drafting formulations that might accommodate a specific exemption to address the Cook Islands concern.  The language that was eventually agreed became footnote 1 to paragraph 8 of CMM 2017-01, and it states:  “In 2018, the Cook Islands may charter purse seine vessels to fish on the high seas adjacent to the Cook Islands EEZ and the effort of those vessels shall be limited to 100 vessel days and attributed to the Cook Islands.  WCPFC15 shall consider whether this special arrangement will be continued.”"
WCPFC14,252,"The final key issue was that the current CMM expires on the 31 December 2017. The issue was that according to Article 20 paragraph 5, it was not possible for the new CMM to enter into effect any earlier than 60 days after the end of this Commission meeting, which would be the 6 February 2018.  This would potentially leave a gap in which no measures for tropical tuna would apply. 50"
WCPFC14,253,"At the request of the Chair, the Legal Advisor provided advice indicating that there were three possible options to address this issue: 1) That the Commission could use the exemption adopted at the 2012 meeting as a precedent for an exemption to the 60 day rule, noting that the Commission had agreed in 2012 that that exemption would not set a precedent for the future; 2) The Commission could agree to a Resolution that all CCMs apply the new measure provisionally from 1st January 2018 to 6th February 2018. 3) The Commission could agree to extend the application of the expiring measure to fill the gap between 1 January 2018 and 6 February 2018.  The Legal Advisor suggested the provisional application option as being the most consistent with the Convention and past practice."
WCPFC14,254,"Following the conclusion of the negotiations of CMM 2017-01, the Commission considered the recommendation of the Legal Advisor and agreed to a Resolution that would confirm the decision of CCMs to provisionally apply CMM 2017-01 from 1 January 2018 in order to ensure the continuation of management measures during early part of 2018."
WCPFC14,255,"New Zealand proposed, to avoid a similar situation arising following review of CMM 2017-01, that CMM 2017-01 remains in effect until 10 February 2021 unless otherwise replaced by the Commission."
WCPFC14,256,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2017-01 Conservation and Management Measure for Bigeye, Yellowfin and Skipjack tuna (Attachment M)."
WCPFC14,257,"Noting that CMM 2017-01 enters into effect on 6 February 2018, the Commission agreed to Resolution 2017-01 Resolution on the Provisional Application of CMM 2017-01 (Attachment N), for the period from 1 January to 6 February 2018."
WCPFC14,258,The Commission agreed that the FAD Management Options IWG would resume its work in 2018 and hold a meeting immediately following TCC14.  The FAD Management IWG will provide advice to WCPFC15 inter alia on guidelines for the implementation of non-entangling and/or biodegradable material on FADs; and on whether the number of FADs deployed as set out in CMM 2017-01 paragraph 23 is appropriate.   7.3 Draft Bridging CMM on South Pacific albacore
WCPFC14,259,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members presented WCPFC14-2017-DP14 Proposal for Conservation and Management Measure for the Development of an improved South Pacific albacore Measure.  The development of this proposal had considered the discussions during the Intersessional Meeting to Progress the FFA Consultative Draft CMM to establish a Limit for South Pacific albacore held on 4th October 2017 immediately following TCC13 (WCPFC14-2017-IM-SPA1).  That meeting had considered the FFA members WCPFC13 proposal for a consultative CMM that was intended to provide a bridge from CMM 2015-02 to the adoption of a more comprehensive proposal.  The contributions of the CCMs that had participated in the intersessional meeting were acknowledged as having assisted in improving understanding of the views of all the Members, and it was explained that the draft CMM proposal had changed considerably as a result.  DP14 proposes a framework to establish plans to guide the work of the Commission in developing a comprehensive measure for the management of fisheries for South Pacific albacore tuna. This future measure will set agreed limits, establish effective fishery monitoring processes, and act to implement the elements of the Harvest Strategy relating to this stock and its fisheries.  It was noted that the proposal has taken a revised approach and is no longer a bridging measure that sought to replace CMM 2015-02.  Rather the proposal seeks to establish the management objectives for the fishery and seeks the Commission’s commitment to develop three work plans for improved South Pacific albacore management and to support the implementation of the harvest strategy.  New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, looked forward to further discussions on the proposal during the informal SWG during WCPFC14.   51"
WCPFC14,260,The Commission agreed that an informal SWG led by New Zealand would be established to facilitate further discussion of both South Pacific albacore proposals (DP13 and DP14) during the meeting.
WCPFC14,261,New Zealand reported on the outcomes from the SWG on south Pacific albacore (WCPFC14-2017-SWG_SPALB02). The proposal in WCPFC14-2017-DP14 was the basis for discussion in the small working group. The proposal developed a lot further over the course of those discussions at WCPFC14 and the outcome from the SWG was a proposal to support the development of a roadmap to implement elements needed for implementation of the harvest strategy and the effective conservation and management of south Pacific albacore.  The SWG agreed that a roadmap for South Pacific albacore should be developed over 2018 and submitted to WCPFC15. New Zealand offered to lead this work in a virtual intersessional working group and CCMs were invited to inform New Zealand of their designated representatives and contact details for this group before the end of the meeting.
WCPFC14,262,"A number of CCMs thanked New Zealand for leading this work. CCMs supported the recommendations and believed that it was important to continue the work on this stock.  The importance of the development of a harvest strategy was also recognised, noting that SIDS and Participating Territories were extremely concerned about the management of this very important economic resource. Many CCMs urged the Commission to give full priority to the development of a harvest strategy for South Pacific albacore in 2018 and through the proposed process that full consideration was given to the concerns and needs of SIDS and Participating Territories."
WCPFC14,263,The outcome for the proposal in DP13 for a target reference point for the South Pacific albacore can be found in the decisions under Agenda Item 6.4.
WCPFC14,264,"The Commission agreed to the formation of a virtual intersessional process to develop a Roadmap to implement the elements needed for the effective conservation and management for South Pacific albacore.  The roadmap will take into account the outcome of a revised stock assessment for South Pacific albacore in 2018 and recommend an overall limit for the fishery, how it could be distributed (taking into account the interests of SIDS) and the actions required to achieve biological and economic stability in the fishery.  This roadmap will include recommendations for a review of the existing CMM for South Pacific albacore.  The terms of reference of this intersessional group will be to consider management issues for South Pacific albacore including: a. The elements necessary for the implementation of a Harvest Strategy approach to the management of the stock; b. an allocation process; and   c. monitoring and reporting priorities, and addressing of gaps, for all fisheries taking South Pacific albacore within the WCPFC convention area."
WCPFC14,265,"Also in support of the development of a Roadmap for South Pacific albacore, the Commission also agreed to task: a. SC14 to provide WCPFC15 with advice on technical aspects of the South Pacific albacore harvest strategy including, for example, a consideration of scientific elements of candidate harvest control rules, and potential components of the management procedure (e.g. the use of CPUE (vulnerable biomass) indices to inform on stock status);  b. TCC14 to evaluate monitoring and reporting gaps in the South Pacific albacore fishery, as well as SIDS and Participating Territories implementation considerations; and  52 c. SC14 and TCC14, based on their evaluations, will provide any appropriate advice or recommendations to WCPFC15 with respect to informing the development of the Roadmap for improving South Pacific albacore management."
WCPFC14,266,"The Commission accepted New Zealand’s offer to lead this intersessional working group, and noted New Zealand’s request that all CCMs with an interest in participating in this intersessional working group nominate a point of contact to New Zealand before the conclusion of WCPFC14. 7.4 CMM 2005-03 on North Pacific albacore"
WCPFC14,267,The Commission considered the recommendations from NC13 related to the review of CMM 2005-03 on North Pacific albacore.  It was noted that the Secretariat had provided WCPFC14-2017-14 (Rev1) Reference Document for Review of CMM 2005-03 and for the Development of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 north Pacific albacore (Thunnus alalunga).
WCPFC14,268,"The NC Vice-Chair Michael Tosatto (United States) noted that the outcome of discussions at SC13 and NC13 indicated that the North Pacific albacore stock was in good condition so there was no recommendation for changes to CMM 2005-03. The management strategy evaluation, led by ISC, was progressing well. The management objective for the North Pacific albacore fishery was to maintain the biomass, with reasonable variability, around its current level in order to allow recent exploitation levels to continue and with a low risk of breaching the limit reference point."
WCPFC14,269,"Ocean Friends Against Driftnets noted that it was a WCPFC observer made up of Pacific fisherman, mostly troll fisherman. After the return of the IUU driftnet fleet in the Pacific post-2002, its members had been non-productive since 2004. It requested the Commission to rebuild the North Pacific albacore stocks to pre-2000 levels.  7.5 CMM 2016-04 on Pacific bluefin tuna"
WCPFC14,270,The Commission considered recommendations from the NC13 related to the review of CMM 2016-04 on Pacific bluefin tuna.  It was noted that the Secretariat had provided WCPFC14-2017-15 Reference Document for Review of CMM 2016-04 and for the Development of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 Pacific Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus orientalis).
WCPFC14,271,"NC Vice-Chair updated the Commission on the review of this CMM and the relevant tasks to the NC13 from WCPFC13. The second joint IATTC-WCPFC NC working group meeting on the management of PBF was held in Busan, Korea from August 28 – 31, 2017 as an informal meeting. NC13 received the report of the Joint Working Group Meeting between NC and IATTC (NC13 Summary Report, Attachment E). NC13 endorsed the conclusions of the joint working group meeting and agreed to incorporate them into relevant recommendations to the Commission.  A proposal to revise the CMM on Pacific bluefin tuna was made by NC13 (NC13 Summary Report, Attachment G)."
WCPFC14,272,The Commission Chair asked if CCMs were prepared to adopt the revised CMM on Pacific bluefin tuna as recommended by the Northern Committee.
WCPFC14,273,The Chair noted that the Pacific Bluefin harvest strategy for Pacific bluefin tuna fisheries would be discussed under Agenda Item 6.8.
WCPFC14,274,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2017-08 Conservation and Management Measure for Pacific Bluefin tuna (Attachment O), which will replace CMM 2016-04 and which was prepared to implement the Harvest Strategy for Pacific bluefin tuna fisheries.   53"
WCPFC14,275,The Commission noted the proposed workplan to develop a Catch Documentation Scheme for Pacific bluefin tuna that is included as an attachment to CMM 2017-08. 7.6 Others – North Pacific Striped Marlin
WCPFC14,276,"The United States noted that despite the Northern Committee not having been charged with responsibility for this stock, concerns have been expressed about the status of North Pacific striped marlin. In his capacity as NC Vice-Chair, Michael Tosatto (United States), referred the meeting to the recommendation in paragraph 91 of the NC13 Summary Report which states “NC13 expressed concern over the status of North Pacific striped marlin and urged the Commission to develop a rebuilding plan for the stock as a matter of priority. NC members are encouraged to submit a draft CMM, if possible.”  The United States reiterated that the status of the North Pacific striped marlin remains a concern for the United States and for the Northern Committee, and the Commission should develop a rebuilding plan for this stock as a matter of priority."
WCPFC14,277,"The Chair sought the views of CCMs to address the status of this stock, as recommended by NC13."
WCPFC14,278,The European Union shared the concern for the status of North Pacific striped marlin and agreed that this was a matter of priority for the Commission.  It urged that based on the stock status the Commission must take concerted action to towards ensuring that adequate measures are taken next year.
WCPFC14,279,"The United States clarified that owing to the North Pacific striped marlin stock not yet being designated as a northern stock by this Commission, the NC felt it was constrained in being able to submit a draft CMM as a recommendation to the Commission.  It would be preferable for the Commission to first resolve the question of whether the North Pacific striped marlin and the North Pacific blue shark were northern stocks, so the Northern Committee could be clearer as to its management responsibility in respect of those stocks."
WCPFC14,280,The Chair emphasised the point was that the North Pacific striped marlin is overfished and urged the Commission to take the necessary steps to address this.
WCPFC14,281,"Some CCMs expressed a preference that because the North Pacific striped marlin was not designated as a Northern stock, that the SC alone should be tasked to provide advice and recommendations to the Commission next year.  Other CCMs expressed a preference that the Commission task SC to consider available information and to recommend whether this stock should be designated as a northern stock."
WCPFC14,282,"Japan had suggested as a way forward, that there might be a conditional recommendation based on outcome of SC14 on the question of designating North Pacific striped marlin as a northern stock: so if SC recommends it as a northern stock, then the Commission could task NC to manage this stock and provide a recommendation to the Commission; however if SC recommended that it was not a northern stock, then SC would be requested to make a recommendation to the Commission."
WCPFC14,283,"During the course of the discussions it was clarified that scientific information and stock assessments for North Pacific striped marlin had been provided by ISC in the past, and North Pacific striped marlin was traditionally covered in the ISC work program.  The ISC will conduct another North Pacific striped marlin assessment in 2019 and since SPC is a standing member of the ISC Billfish Working Group (BILLWG), there was a mechanism to involve them in the upcoming stock assessment.   54"
WCPFC14,284,"Some CCMs expressed that because North Pacific striped marlin has been recognised to be overfished and overfishing occurring for some years, it wasn’t appropriate for the Commission to wait for an updated stock assessment due in 2019 before developing a CMM and rebuilding proposal."
WCPFC14,285,"As a way forward, the Chair requested that the Secretariat provide some background on past SC discussions on North Pacific striped marlin."
WCPFC14,286,"The Science Manager Dr SungKwon Soh confirmed that North Pacific striped marlin designation as a northern stock was first discussed at SC in 2007-2008. The NC had at that time requested that the Commission designate North Pacific striped marlin as a northern stock. As requested by the NC, the ISC provided the results of an analysis to SC4 that estimated the majority (65–70%) of the biomass of the North Pacific striped marlin to occur north of 20°N latitude. However, SC4 noted that the information presented was not sufficient to demonstrate that North Pacific striped marlin be classified as a northern stock. The Commission noted that there has not yet been a recommendation by the SC that northern striped marlin is a northern stock.  The ISC Chair was asked to elaborate on the information that was submitted to support SCs consideration of whether it should be designated as a northern stock."
WCPFC14,287,"The ISC Chair noted that ISC did provide the necessary information at SC4 to render a designation determination. Previous information included both genetic and catch data, which clearly indicated that it was a northern stock.  The ISC chair confirmed that he was not certain that there would be any new information available in 2018 to inform a decision of a designation of North Pacific striped marlin as a northern stock.  Irrespective of the question of designation as a northern stock, he further urged that NP striped marlin has been considered to be in an overfished state for a number of years and no action has been taken by the Commission in response."
WCPFC14,288,Many CCMs confirmed that whether North Pacific striped marlin was a northern stock or not was not the problem.  It was acknowledged that the best available information is that North Pacific striped marlin is in an overfished condition therefore urgent action was needed to rebuild the stock.  These CCMs expressed support for the SC being tasked to provide recommendations.  It was also acknowledged that any management measures can be reviewed if any new information came out of a new stock assessment in the future.
WCPFC14,289,"Japan cautioned that SC11 had already made a recommendation to the Commission, which was that the Commission develop a rebuilding plan for the NP striped marlin in order to improve stock status."
WCPFC14,290,"The Chair in summarising the discussions confirmed that ultimately this matter would mean this issue is revisited at WCPFC15 following advice from SC14. The eventual outcome of this agenda item including tasking to SC14, is recorded under Agenda Item 9.2 NC13 Summary Report.   AGENDA ITEM 8 – BYCATCH MITIGATION  8.1 Sharks (CMMs: 2010-07; 2011-04; 2012-04; 2013-08; 2014-05)"
WCPFC14,291,"The European Union introduced WCPFC14-2017-DP01 Proposal for a Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks caught in association with fisheries managed by WCPFC, which aimed to change fishing, storing and processing practices on-board vessels that implement the finning ban through the application of the 5% fins to carcass weight ratio. It proposed that CCMs shall prohibit the removal of shark fins at sea and the retention on board, transhipment and landing of shark fins."
WCPFC14,292,Japan thanked the European Union for tabling this proposal. The position of Japan on this issue was well known so it would not repeat it. Japan was not in a position to support this proposal but 55 it would like to discuss this issue in the context of the comprehensive shark conservation measure at this Meeting.
WCPFC14,293, China thanked the European Union and noted that it had a similar position to Japan. It could not support this proposal.
WCPFC14,294,The United States thanked the European Union. It believed this was a significant issue that needed to be addressed if the Commission was committed to taking a more comprehensive approach to shark conservation and time should be taken to see if CMMs could reach agreement on this issue. It supported this measure being explored in the discussions of the broader comprehensive measure.
WCPFC14,295,Kiribati noted that its position was similar to Japan and others. It had concerns on some of the elements proposed and it believed the proposal would burden its artisanal fisherman and would hurt subsistence fishers that rely on utilising as much of their catch as possible. Kiribati said the measure should focus on commercial fishermen that catch more sharks.
WCPFC14,296,Australia thanked the European Union for progressing this initiative. It was entirely consistent with Australian domestic law and Australia was comfortable with supporting the proposal.
WCPFC14,297,"The European Union thanked the United States and others for their strong support of this measure. TCC had been saying for a number of years that the 5% ratio was not an appropriate means to ensure the recommendations were implemented. It understood that some Members still had hesitations and it hoped that the Commission could move forward and more members moved towards the fins “naturally attached proposal”. In response to Kiribati’s proposed exemption, the European Union was not willing to introduce any exemptions to its fins naturally attached proposal. The only way to make sure no finning was occurring was to have an “all fins naturally attached” policy."
WCPFC14,298,"Papua New Guinea noted the European Union proposal but emphasised the need to recognise artisanal fishing. It supported the position of Kiribati. It noted the proposal to remove paragraph 11 of CMM 2010-07 which provides for alternative measures in national waters. As Papua New Guinea said last year, paragraph 11 was important and it had to be retained."
WCPFC14,299,"Palau noted the European Union proposal that was presented last year, which led to a decision on a more comprehensive approach. FFA Members noted SC13 recommended two options for the development of a comprehensive shark and ray measure for WCPFC15 adoption, and FFA Members lent their support to the option to collate existing measures. They also noted the TCC13 recommendation requesting the Secretariat to develop terms of reference to guide the work of an intersessional drafting group in 2018. Several FFA members were interested in participating in a drafting group. The Chair noted that this discussion would come up under agenda item 8.1.1."
WCPFC14,300,"Indonesia thanked the European Union. It understood a lot of effort was put into this work. It found that it was quite common to have difficulties collecting data on bycatch though Indonesia tried hard to meet the CMM requirements. Regarding the text in paragraph 7 “shall report catch of each species”, its understanding was that this information would be reported to the Commission. Indonesia could agree to that sentence. It sought clarification if that was all catch species or was it just the species referred to in the measures."
WCPFC14,301,"FSM thanked the European Union. It supported the interventions of Kiribati, Palau, and Papua New Guinea. The distinction between the high seas and the fisheries of EEZs and the impact on subsistence fisheries was important. FSM supported the views of Palau and language more explicitly applied to the high seas and the EEZs. For FSM, the CMM was more of a minimum standard compared with its own domestic laws. It would like to see more language on EEZs taking into account cultural differences, but could agree in principal to the approach proposed by the European Union to protect marine species.  56"
WCPFC14,302,Samoa supported the proposal but it also needed to consider its small fleet. There must be a consideration for exceptions and that had to be seriously considered for Samoa’s small fleets.
WCPFC14,303,"The Chair summarised that despite clear expressions of interest to explore how the Commission could strengthen its shark conservation measures, there was no consensus on the European Union proposal at this time. This discussion could continue under agenda item 8.1.1 below.  8.1.1 Comprehensive approach to shark and ray conservation and management"
WCPFC14,304,"Dr Shelly Clarke (WCPFC Secretariat/ ABNJ Common Oceans Project) presented WCPFC14-2017-17 Development of a Comprehensive Shark CMM for the WCPFC. It updated WCPFC14 on discussions held by SC13 and TCC13 in the context of work towards the development of a comprehensive shark and ray conservation and management measure (CMM) which would unify the five existing shark and ray measures. The paper also responded to TCC13’s request for the Secretariat to prepare draft terms of reference for a possible intersessional drafting group to be established by WCPFC14 that could draft a measure for consideration at the next Commission meeting. CMMs were asked to consider what type of intersessional working group they wanted to form, such as an ad hoc group, an intersessional working group, a drafting group or a virtual group, whether any chairs or vice-chairs needed to be elected. This meeting needed to agree to terms of reference which included a scope of work to draft a measure to bring to WCPFC15."
WCPFC14,305,The Chair asked for CCMs views on developing the intersessional process to bring a draft measure to WCPFC15 for consideration. An informal SWG at this meeting would develop the terms of reference for the Shark-IWG.
WCPFC14,306,"The European Union thanked Dr Clarke on her excellent work to guide this discussion. It considered this approach as a valid way forward as it was done for shark measures in other RFMOs. Aligning this Commission’s existing measures involved both simple consolidation drafting and more complex amalgamations given the various reporting requirements. The time at this meeting was not sufficient to finish this work properly, so the European Union would support the establishment of an intersessional group. The European Union would be happy to lead, but was also happy to be an active participant."
WCPFC14,307,China supported the continued progress of this comprehensive approach and the establishment of the intersessional group. It suggested Japan could chair the informal SWG at this meeting.
WCPFC14,308,"The United States believed it was important to have a comprehensive approach that would take a full look at the existing measures and develop a way forward. It supported the intersessional working group, though did not have a view on who should lead the discussion of the SWG."
WCPFC14,309,Tuvalu noted that it was always a concern to those members with very small administrations when the Commission was considering establishing more intersessional working groups. It asked for this group to be managed virtually rather than organising more physical meetings.
WCPFC14,310,"Japan also thanked Dr Clarke for her hard work and efforts to progress this comprehensive measure. It had one question regarding the possible terms of reference, specifically the task of providing a framework for development and adoption of new components in 6.2 paragraph 4. When new measures were developed, the proposal would be sent to the Commission to amend the CMM. Japan sought clarification on this text. It supported an electronic / virtual intersessional group and thanked China for nominating Japan to chair the informal SWG. It was happy to assume this role."
WCPFC14,311,"The Chair responded that this paragraph came straight from a decision taken by the Nadi meeting last year, to ensure the proposal remained flexible to reflect the data available. How that was 57 implemented would be up to the terms of reference and any draft that would be developed from these terms of references."
WCPFC14,312,Australia supported the establishment of a virtual intersessional working group. This was an important issue and Australia was keen to play a constructive role.
WCPFC14,313,Canada echoed the comments of support to advance this issue. It was quite a complex assortment of measures and there were differing measures on how they were applied domestically. It appreciated the leadership demonstrated by Dr Clarke and interested CCMs.
WCPFC14,314,The Chair summarised that there was broad support for the intersessional process to continue progress on this comprehensive measure. An informal SWG (led by Japan) was established at this meeting to develop terms of reference for the Sharks-IWG as well as to confirm chairs and/or co-chairs.
WCPFC14,315,Japan reported back on the progress of the SWG and thanked Dr Clarke for her help drafting the document and providing advice. Terms of reference was produced and CCMs agreed that the IWG would develop a draft comprehensive measure which would then be submitted to WCPFC15 for consideration and adoption. Some members were concerned with budgetary implications of establishing another IWG so it was agreed that this group would conduct its work electronically and that Japan would serve as Chair. All CCMs and observers were invited to participate. A draft would be submitted in February next year and one month would be given for comments on content or new ideas and additional provisions. Feedback deadline would be the end of March 2018. This next draft version with comments incorporated would be tested with Dr Clarke and various other technical experts and would be finished sometime between April and SC14 and TCC14. The SWG was mindful that WCPFC had a process underway to identify or define all shark species. The SWG did not have enough time to discuss the development of safe release guidelines but it did identify three possible options: 1) develop for specific shark species; 2) develop for all shark species; 3) do not develop at all as some guidance already existed on website.
WCPFC14,316,"The European Union thanked Japan for their effective Chairing of the SWG and again thanked Dr Clarke for her support. It was pleased with the outcome of the SWG. There was much work ahead and this would rely on the guidance of the IWG Chair. The European Union supported Japan’s continuous Chairing through this process and also hoped that Dr Clarke would be able to continue supporting this work despite moving into her new role as she was essential to the success of this work. On the issue of the safe release guidelines, SC14 should simply be tasked to develop a set of guidelines for silky and whitetip sharks that should take into account existing guidelines adopted in other fora."
WCPFC14,317,The Chair thanked the European Union and noted they proposed WCPFC14 task SC14 to develop and propose a set of guidelines for silky and whitetip sharks for consideration and adoption at WCPFC15.
WCPFC14,318,"The United States remarked that the IWG should discuss and determine whether to develop safe release guidelines for some or all species, not the SC."
WCPFC14,319,"Canada supported progressing this work noting its importance was why Canada supported the IWG at TCC13. A process issue came to mind while its two delegates at this meeting tried to cover as many issues as possible. Canada asked if there was a clearer more simple way to find documents during meetings so that delegates did not need to search several pages to find where documents were placed, either on the secure website or the public website in multiple windows. The Secretariat noted that it was doing its best to manage the documents for this meeting. The document was posted on the public website site as the local meeting server is accessible only from within plenary room when the WCPFC meeting is in session (the meeting room and the meeting server network are shutdown overnight). It was happy to provide guidance on where to find documents.  58"
WCPFC14,320,The European Union responded to United States comments on the safe release guidelines. It did not want any process delay on developing guidelines. The SWG already agreed to develop guidelines for all sharks and there was a recommendation to develop guidelines for these two specific species. There was also a retention ban for these specific species. The current wording did not preclude the development of guidelines for other species.
WCPFC14,321,"Japan responded to the United States and European Union comments. It supported the European Union’s view, that from looking at paragraph five of the terms of reference it reads as though safe release guidelines could be considered for inclusion in the new CMM. If that happened, there would be some difficulty in managing the process due to the size of the workload. Hopefully safe release guidelines for silky and whitetip shark could at least be developed and if SC could do that it would reduce some of Japan’s workload."
WCPFC14,322,"The European Union drew attention back to reference paper WCPFC14-2017-16 Reference Document for Bycatch Mitigation CMM Reviews. Point 5 in the paper reads: “SC13 adopted the Report of ISG-5 on the safe release guidelines for manta and mobulid rays (see Attachment 1)”. These guidelines had not yet been adopted at the level of the Commission, it had only endorsed what the SC has said, so the Commission needed to agree to adopt these guidelines. Regarding Point 6 in the paper: “SC13 recommends TCC13 and WCPFC14 note that SC has not yet adopted Guidelines for safe release for silky and oceanic whitetip sharks”. The European Union proposed the Commission task SC14 and TCC14 to develop these guidelines."
WCPFC14,323,"The Chair clarified that when the Commission adopted the reports of TCC13 and SC13, the recommendations in those reports were also adopted. CCMs could comment on the individual recommendations or issues when those reports were being considered, but they would not be considered one by one. On the issue of safe release guidelines for silky and oceanic whitetip sharks, the Chair suggested that the Commission could agree to discuss in future work on the comprehensive management measure for sharks and rays. The European Union agreed with this approach."
WCPFC14,324,The United States supported the European Union’s proposal for the Commission to adopt the safe release guidelines for manta and mobulid rays.
WCPFC14,325,Chinese Taipei sought clarification on whether the safe release guidelines for manta and mobulid rays were voluntary or mandatory. If voluntary it could support adoption at this meeting.
WCPFC14,326,"FSM clarified that SC had been asked to develop species specific guidelines for silky and white tip sharks. It preferred general guidelines for safe release for all sharks in general, not species specific."
WCPFC14,327,"The European Union responded that the specific guidelines proposal arose because there was a retention ban already in place for those species, but safe release guidelines for all sharks could be explored as a mandatory measure as part of the work on the comprehensive measure. If they were not mandatory then they might not be used."
WCPFC14,328,"Japan supported FSM’s views on the development of safe release guidelines for all shark species. The Commission should instruct SC14 to advise whether they should be voluntary or mandatory on species by species basis, which would account for biological differences."
WCPFC14,329,"SPREP noted in recent years it had taken an active interest in the proceedings of this Commission, particularly in the areas of bycatch of threatened species and marine debris. SPREP had promoted these issues in a number of international fora, including the Convention on Migratory Species, the Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species and at the United Nations Ocean Conference earlier this year. It therefore warmly welcomed this agenda item on the mitigation of bycatch and congratulated the Secretariat on the constructive work that has been carried out in recent 59 years, especially through the ABNJ project. It was particularly grateful for the turtle by-catch mitigation workshops convened through this project in 2016. With the financial support of the European Union, SPREP would be implementing a project on bycatch mitigation in commercial and artisanal fisheries in the Pacific islands region over the next four years. While the main focus of the programme would be on the mitigation of turtle bycatch, it also intended to support investigations of the bycatch of marine mammals, sharks and rays and seabirds, as resources permit. SPREP was very encouraged by the positive attitude adopted by Members in the debate. SPREP welcomed opportunities for collaborations with all stakeholders to support the Commission’s work to mitigate the bycatch of threatened marine vertebrate species. It welcomed discussions in the margins of this meeting on possible opportunities for collaborations with potential partners, including national delegations, IGOs, industry and NGOs."
WCPFC14,330,"The Commission adopted as Guidelines the Best Handling practices for the safe release of manta and mobulids (as referenced in SC13 draft Summary Report, Attachment H, Attachment P)."
WCPFC14,331,The Commission agreed to task SC14 to develop proposed guidelines for safe release of rays and sharks and taking into account existing standards or guidelines adopted on other fora.  The Commission agreed that priority should be given to the development of guidelines for safe release of silky shark and oceanic whitetip sharks.
WCPFC14,332,The Commission agreed to form an intersessional working group to develop a draft comprehensive shark CMM for discussion at WCPFC15 (IWG-Sharks).  The IWG-Sharks will primarily work virtually and will be formed through the issuance of a Circular from the WCPFC Secretariat inviting all parties to nominate representatives to participate in the activities of the group.  The IWG-Sharks will be chaired by Japan.  Terms of reference for the IWG-Sharks are attached at Attachment Q.
WCPFC14,333,"WCPFC14 agreed that the first phase of work will begin with the IWG Chair codifying WCPFC’s existing shark measures, taking into account comprehensiveness, and distributing this draft to participants by the end of February 2018.  The IWG Chair will request that comments on the codified draft, as well as contributions on new elements, from IWG-Sharks participants be received by the end of March 2018.  The IWG Chair will then compile these comments on the codified draft and new elements into a revised draft, requesting technical advice as necessary, and circulate it to IWG-Sharks participants on a timeline to be determined by the IWG Chair, giving due consideration to the timelines for SC14 and TCC14.    8.2 CMM 2015-03 on Seabirds"
WCPFC14,334,"New Zealand presented WCPFC14-2017-DP05 Proposed changes to CMM 2015-03 in regards the seabird mitigation requirements (Rev 1). The purpose of this amendment was in response to the decline in seabird numbers, especially albatross. There was a need to address this by optimising the mitigation required by the fishing industry while also ensuring that mitigation devices were effective at mitigating bycatch. The paper contained two proposals: i) changing tori line requirements for small vessels; ii) the addition of hook shielding devices as one alternative equipment option that could be used instead of line weighting and tori lines. The proposed amendments reflect a recommendation from SC12 on tori lines. There was also a proposed revision to paragraph 9 to make reporting requirements clearer."
WCPFC14,335,The Chair asked if CCMs still wished to discuss this in a SWG at this meeting.  60
WCPFC14,336,Australia was concerned with fishing interactions with seabirds and felt that the problem needed to be addressed. The seabird measure should be discussed in a SWG – these were not scientific issues and should be fully considered at this meeting.
WCPFC14,337,The United States believed that periodic review of CMMs on bycatch was important. It supported New Zealand’s work and supported SWG discussions at this meeting.
WCPFC14,338,"Japan thanked New Zealand for preparing this proposal. Japan was pleased that its fishers could have more equipment options to mitigate seabird bycatch, but were aligned with China. A scientific recommendation from the SC was needed before alternative devise options could be adopted. Particularly, SC recommendation was needed to introduce hook shielding devise as equivalent measure to the combination of night setting, tori line and weighted branch lines.  Also, the fishing method was different in Japan and hook shielding device would not work. The reporting requirement amendment seemed acceptable with minor edits. These could be discussed in SWG if established."
WCPFC14,339,The European Union expressed support for this proposal. It hoped concerns could be addressed in the SWG.
WCPFC14,340,"Samoa supported the measure. In Samoan culture they are called storm birds, rather than seabirds.  They were very important part of Samoan life. Samoa would also like to have timelines given to the consideration of these issues at this meeting, as there were quite a number of issues given to small working groups for consideration at this meeting as they have to be brought back to plenary for finalisation."
WCPFC14,341,China thanked New Zealand for its proposal. It was encouraged by technical developments so that new devices could be used. As it was a technical development it should be reviewed by the SC as the proposal only demonstrated that one CMM had good results from these new devices. It had no objection to continuing discussions in a SWG.
WCPFC14,342,"Chinese Taipei also had some concerns, including revision of current the measure. The hook shielding device would need some more costing information for fishermen of small scale fishing vessels. It supported the establishment of the SWG."
WCPFC14,343,A SWG led by New Zealand considered the proposal in greater detail. New Zealand regularly updated the Commission of the progress and final outcomes of the SWG.
WCPFC14,344,"Australia thanked New Zealand for its proposal and continued efforts to lead strengthening of measures to reduce bycatch of seabirds in WCPFC fisheries. Australia welcomed the adoption of revisions to tori line requirements and the amendments to data reporting, noting the importance of both providing flexibility for small vessels and improving data collection on seabird bycatch. Australia noted the extensive evidence of the effectiveness of hook shielding devices for minimising seabird bycatch and did expect that the Commission would be able to agree to the use of these as an optional mitigation device this year, however it supported the recommendation that SC14 review this information with a view to agreeing to the use of these devices next year."
WCPFC14,345,"While the United States was disappointed to see hook shielding devices removed from the measure as a formally recognised mitigation device, it was comfortable with the way forward."
WCPFC14,346,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2017-06 Conservation and Management Measure for Mitigating Impacts of Fishing on Seabirds (Attachment R), which will replace CMM 2015-03.   61"
WCPFC14,347,The Commission tasks SC14 and TCC14 to review the available research on hook shielding devices and advise WCPFC15 if they are effective options for seabird bycatch mitigation in WCPFC fisheries and whether to incorporate them in the seabird CMM as additional mitigation options.  8.3 CMM 2008-03 on Sea Turtles
WCPFC14,348,"The United States introduced WCPFC14-2017-DP20_Rev1 Potential Revisions to CMM 2008-03, Conservation and Management Measure of Sea Turtles (Rev1), which suggested the SC and TCC be tasked to provide recommendations to the Commission on several specific matters as follows: The proposal was for the Commission to task SC14 and TCC14 to evaluate the expected effects of several potential sea turtle management scenarios, including ones in which vessels in all longline fisheries in the Convention Area are required to: i) use either large circle hooks or whole finfish for bait; (2ii) use large circle hooks and whole finfish for bait; or iii) use any other combination of mitigation methods identified by the SC as being potentially effective. SC’s evaluation should focus on expected effects on sea turtle interactions and mortalities and on target species catch rates. TCC’s evaluation should focus on implementation and compliance implications. A large circle hook should be considered as having a minimum width of at least 4.4 centimetres. Based on the evaluations, SC14 and TCC14 will provide any appropriate advice or recommendations to WCPFC15 with respect to improving CMM 2008-03."
WCPFC14,349,"The United States also introduced WCPFC14-2017-DP21_Rev1 Potential revisions to ROP minimum data– standards - in respect of sea turtles (Rev 1). In 2016, the WCPFC convened two workshops that were funded by the ABNJ (Common Oceans) Tuna project to analyse the effectiveness of sea turtle mitigation in Pacific longline fisheries with respect to rates of interaction and mortality. The second workshop included recommendations on data collection by fishery observers. The participants of the workshop agreed that one of the best approaches to obtaining high quality data for similar analyses in the future was to ensure that data collection protocols for turtle interactions with fisheries, and those describing the associated fishing effort, were standardised. The workshop recommended specific updates to the WCPFC Regional Observer Programme (ROP) Minimum Standard Data Fields. The United States agreed that improved data collection on sea turtle interactions would be useful for the Commission’s work. It suggested that the Commission direct the SC, TCC, and the Secretariat to consider the workshop’s recommendations and recommend appropriate modifications to the ROP Minimum Standard Data Fields. The United States proposed draft decision text and welcomed proposed edits. The United States noted that early comments from CCMs had already been incorporated in Rev1 versions of each paper"
WCPFC14,350,"Tonga on behalf of FFA Members thanked the United States for their discussion papers. FFA Members lent their support to the recommendations contained in both DP20 and DP21, noting the clear proposals of future work for the SC and TCC."
WCPFC14,351,"Japan thanked the United States for this proposal and for the opportunity to provide early feedback. Japan’s comment on needing to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures had been incorporated. This Commission should also discuss catch rates of bycatch species, just like International Commission for Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Some mitigation techniques might increase catch rates of sharks, so that they should also be considered and reflected."
WCPFC14,352,"The European Union thanked the United States for its papers and for the recommendations. It had one comment that was already incorporated into Rev1, so it could support the proposal. It had one other question regarding the extensive discussion at SC13 this year that was not resolved, which related to concerns about the impacts on other bycatch and target species. Was the United States going to submit new papers to progress this issue? Did it need more elements or new data for the next SC meeting? etc. The United States responded that when SC13 discussed this issue they discussed 62 recommendations from the ABNJ workshop, what they would like to look at next year would be their evaluation of their mitigation measures."
WCPFC14,353,"China thanked the United States for the recommendations. China could support them. There was one minor issue with minimum hook size of 4.4 cm. Since it was the Commission’s decision to ask the SC for advice, China wanted to avoid asking the SC about size for now and remain focused on minimum hook standards. The United States responded that the hook size was a recommendation from the ABNJ turtle mitigation workshop"
WCPFC14,354,"FSM on behalf of PNA Members thanked the United States for following up on the workshops on sea turtle mitigation in longline fisheries. They supported in principle the United States proposal to refer the recommendations of the workshops on data collection by observers to the SC. PNA Members would like to task the SC to consider also the alternative of having some of this data provided by the vessel operators, especially data on fishing gear. They noted that longline observer coverage was very low and highly unrepresentative, and observer workloads were growing. PNA Members thought it made sense for the SC to look at the option of some of this data being provided by vessel operators. It provided a small text revision to the United States to reflect this option."
WCPFC14,355,Japan supported FSM’s comments and noted that the work load of observers should also be considered.
WCPFC14,356,Chinese Taipei supported the proposal from United States but had some concerns and would like to have a discussion in the SWG. The Commission Chair responded that a SWG would not be established to further discuss the draft recommendations in these papers. The Commission was just testing support for the recommendations as they were currently drafted.
WCPFC14,357,"The United States continued to work in the margins with interested delegations to further revise the recommendations. It tabled new recommendations in the new revisions of each paper as follow: • WCPFC14-2017-DP20_Rev3 proposed:  The Commission tasks SC14 and TCC14 to evaluate the expected effects of several potential sea turtle management scenarios, including, but not limited to, ones in which vessels in all longline fisheries in the Convention Area are required to: (1) use either large circle hooks or whole finfish for bait; (2) use large circle hooks and whole finfish for bait; or (3) use any other combination of mitigation methods identified by the SC as being potentially effective. The SC may consider a range of large circle hook specifications. SC’s evaluation should focus on expected effects on sea turtle interactions and mortalities and on target and bycatch species catch rates. A large circle hook should be considered as having a minimum width of at least 4.4 centimeters. TCC’s evaluation should focus on implementation and compliance implications, as well as SIDS implementation considerations. Based on the evaluations, SC14 and TCC14 will provide any appropriate advice or recommendations to WCPFC15 with respect to improving CMM 2008-03.  • WCPFC14-2017-DP21_Rev2 proposed:  WCPFC14 tasks SC14 to consider the recommendations of the recent Joint Analysis of Sea Turtle Mitigation Effectiveness workshops to modify the ROP Minimum Standard Data Fields with respect to improving the collection of data related to sea turtle interactions, taking into account capacity of observers and priority of data collection, and to recommend any modifications for the consideration of the ROP Coordinator, TCC14 and WCPFC15. SC may also consider possible modifications to operational level data requirements.  63"
WCPFC14,358,"The European Union questioned whether the tasking may also consider a range of circle hooks and large range of circle hooks, or large hooks in general. United States clarified it would look at a large range of circle hooks. The European Union sought further clarification on why just large circle hooks and not a range of specifications or large circle hooks. Just stating hooks did not preclude the specific hooks the United States had already mentioned and could allow for a broader range."
WCPFC14,359,Samoa supported the proposal but sought clarification on minimum size of the hook. Had it been considered as it thought it was still too big.
WCPFC14,360,"The United States further noted the existing measures contained a reference to large circle hooks and as this tasking was seeking better clarity, that was why the provided text included a range."
WCPFC14,361,The Chair thanked the United States for progressing this work.
WCPFC14,362,"The Commission tasks SC14 and TCC14 to evaluate the expected effects of several potential sea turtle management scenarios, including, but not limited to, ones in which vessels in all longline fisheries in the Convention Area are required to: (1) use either large circle hooks or whole finfish for bait; (2) use large circle hooks and whole finfish for bait; or (3) use any other combination of mitigation methods identified by the SC as being potentially effective. The SC may consider a range of specifications for large circle hooks.  SC’s evaluation should focus on expected effects on sea turtle interactions and mortalities and on target and bycatch species catch rates. TCC’s evaluation should focus on implementation and compliance implications, as well as SIDS implementation considerations. Based on the evaluations, SC14 and TCC14 will provide any appropriate advice or recommendations to WCPFC15 with respect to improving CMM 2008-03."
WCPFC14,363,"WCPFC14 tasks SC14 to consider the recommendations of the recent Joint Analysis of Sea Turtle Mitigation Effectiveness workshops to modify the ROP Minimum Standard Data Fields with respect to improving the collection of data related to sea turtle interactions, taking into account capacity of observers and priority of data collection, and to recommend any modifications for the consideration of the ROP Coordinator, TCC14 and WCPFC15. SC may also consider possible modifications to operational level data requirements. AGENDA ITEM 9 – ADOPTION OF REPORTS FROM SUBSIDIARY BODIES"
WCPFC14,364,Reports of the subsidiary bodies were taken as read and were not presented. The Commission considered under this agenda item only recommendations that were not specifically addressed under other agenda items. A consolidation of the relevant recommendations of each subsidiary body report requiring the Commission’s consideration were provided in reference documents outlined below.  9.1 13th Annual Session of the Scientific Committee (SC13)
WCPFC14,365,"The Commission was referred to WCPFC14-2017-18 Synopsis of SC13 Summary Report, and WCPFC14-2017-SC13 Summary Report of the Thirteenth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee (Adopted Version), during the adoption of the SC13 Summary Report and relevant recommendations.  64 Guidelines for Voluntary provision of economic data to the Commission by CCMs"
WCPFC14,366,"Kiribati, on behalf of PNA members, strongly supported the work of the ERandEM IWG and hoped that a meeting of this working group could be arranged in 2018. PNA Members supported the proposal by FFA Members for the ERandEM IWG to meet immediately prior to SC14. Several PNA Members had small administrations that often were not able to send a staff member to specialist workshops and could not afford to have staff away for 2 weeks for a 1 or 2-day workshop. The result was that small administrations were often left out and excluded from stand-alone meetings. They supported holding this working group meeting immediately prior to the SC."
WCPFC14,367,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA Members, wished to address two outputs from the SC13 report. Firstly, FFA Members supported the recommendation for the ERandEM IWG to convene in advance of SC14 and suggested immediately prior to SC14 in 2018. FFA Members were also mindful that the decision to hold additional meetings could only be made once a full picture of proposals for working groups and meetings was available nearer the end of WCPFC14. Secondly, FFA Members supported the Commission adopting the outputs of the Virtual Working Group to develop principles to inform the development of guidelines for the Voluntary Submission of Economic Data to the Commission, as provided in Circular 2017/87. FFA members also wished to thank the outgoing SC Chair, Ms. Berry Muller, and Vice-Chair, Mr. Aisake Batibasaga for their excellent service and leadership over the Scientific Committee in the last few years."
WCPFC14,368,The outcomes for the proposal for an ERandEM IWG meeting in 2018 can be found in the decisions under Agenda Item 9.3 TCC13 Report and Agenda Item 13.4 Future meetings.
WCPFC14,369,The Commission accepted the Report of the SC virtual inter-sessional working group on the development of guidelines for the voluntary provision of economic data to the Commission by CCMs (WCPFC Circular 2017/87).  The Commission agreed to the list of principles to inform the development of guidelines for the voluntary provision of economic data to the Commission by CCMs (Attachment S).
WCPFC14,370,"The Commission adopted the SC13 Summary Report (WCPFC14-2017-SC13), noting the recommendations with budgetary implications would be considered by FAC.  9.2 13th Annual Session of the Northern Committee (NC13)"
WCPFC14,371,"The Commission was referred to WCPFC14-2017-NC13 NC13 Summary Report (Adopted)-02Sep2017, during the adoption of the NC13 Summary Report and relevant recommendations.  North Pacific blue shark"
WCPFC14,372,"Japan asked the Commission to discuss the NC13 recommendation (NC13 Summary Report paragraph 96) that WCPFC14 should decide if North Pacific blue shark should be designated as a Northern stock based on the available information from ISC, SPC and the advice of SC. Japan supported the designation of NP blue shark as a Northern stock, and clarified that the recommendation relates to North Pacific blue shark (rather than blue shark species)."
WCPFC14,373,"The European Union thanked Japan but noted that based on the discussions earlier in the meeting that were informed by the ISC presentation on stock status of North Pacific blue shark, it was unable to support the designation of North Pacific blue shark as a Northern stock at this meeting.  At 65 this point in time, there was not sufficient information, particularly a clear recommendation from the SC, to support the Commission designating this as a northern stock at this meeting."
WCPFC14,374,"The United States reflected on the discussions under Agenda 7.6 for NP striped marlin, and noted that like for North Pacific blue shark, the question remains whether to designate as a northern stock.  For North Pacific striped marlin, the ISC had provided information to the SC, but the SC did not believe that enough information had been provided to demonstrate it was a northern stock, and has not made a recommendation to the Commission to consider.  For North Pacific blue shark, the NC has requested on three occasions that the SC provide a recommendation to the Commission to designate North Pacific blue shark as a northern stock, however the SC is yet to provide this advice.  Two options were suggested: either the Commission take a decision here based on the ISC and NC information and designate this as a northern stock, or that the Commission task SC to provide advice on the status of this species so that an informed decision could be made at WCPFC15 on whether it is a northern stock or not."
WCPFC14,375,"The Chair noted that since at least one Member had indicated that it was unable to support the designation of North Pacific blue shark as a northern stock at this meeting, CCMs could consider tasking SC14 to prioritise a recommendation on that matter of designating NP blue shark as a northern stock.  There was general support for this approach."
WCPFC14,376,Palau suggested that it was important that the SC have sufficient background information from the ISC so that the SC was able to consider recommendations of whether the Commission should designate any northern stocks.  There were no contrary views expressed on this suggestion.
WCPFC14,377,The discussions related to North Pacific striped marlin for the outcome noted below are recorded under Agenda Item 7.6. North Pacific striped marlin.
WCPFC14,378,"The Commission agreed to task SC14 to prioritise determination of whether the North Pacific striped marlin and North Pacific blue shark are northern stocks and as applicable provide updated management advice and recommendations to WCPFC15.  To support the SC’s consideration of these matters in 2018, the Scientific Services Provider (SPC-OFP) and ISC were requested to provide to SC14 papers that provide available information on the status of these stocks and the catch levels in their associated fisheries."
WCPFC14,379,The Commission adopted the report of NC13 (WCPFC14-2017-NC13).  9.3 13th Annual Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC13)
WCPFC14,380,"The Commission was referred to WCPFC14-2017-19 Reference Paper for TCC13 Recommendations, which provided a quick reference guide to the recommendations of the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC13) of relevance to WCPFC14 discussions.  It was noted that the full report of TCC13 was also tabled for consideration WCPFC14-2017-TCC13 TCC13 Summary Report Final - issued 14 November 2017. FAD Management Options IWG in 2018"
WCPFC14,381,"Tuvalu on behalf of FFA Members noted that while much of the work stemming from the FAD management working group had been taken up by the SC and TCC, there were still some areas of outstanding work. It noted the departure of the Chair of that working group, Mr. Brian Kumasi and 66 thanked him for his service. FFA Members wished to nominate Mr. Bradley Philip from FSM as the new Chair of that working group."
WCPFC14,382,"Greenpeace, Pew Charitable Trusts, WWF and Sustainable Fisheries Partnership, and ISSF, welcomed the appointment of officers for the FAD Working Group. They stated that FADs were critical gear in the WCPO fisheries and that the Commission should task the FAD Working Group with creating a management framework to improve data collection on FADs, and measures to mitigate the catch of juvenile tunas on FADs, entanglement of sharks and turtles, and the gear’s contribution to marine debris.  In their view, as a starting point, the working group should consider a series of best practices developed by a group of experts meeting at an independent FAD science symposium last March. They referred to Papers SC13-EB-WP-02, Review of research into drifting FAD designs to reduce bycatch entanglement and bigeye/yellowfin interactions; and SC13-MI-WP-06 What does well-managed FAD use look like within a tropical tuna purse seine fishery? were discussed at SC13 and outlined best practices, and SC13 recommended the Commission consider those best practices and take into consideration the decision and position of some progressive market players when developing a management framework for FADs. They acknowledged that although some discussion on aspects of FAD management had already occurred at this meeting, it was time for a more comprehensive system of management for FADs, and the working group should be the vehicle to make progress on these issues."
WCPFC14,383,The outcomes for the proposal for a FAD Management Options IWG meeting in 2018 can be found in the decisions under Agenda Item 13.3 Election of Officers and Agenda Item 13.4 Future meetings.  Marking and monitoring of FADs
WCPFC14,384,"The Commission noted that TCC13 had supported the recommendation from SC13 (SC13 draft Summary Report, paragraph 118) that recommends as a first step the Commission considers introducing a buoy ID scheme, and that field tests be undertaken to determine the optimal configuration of future developments of a full marking system.   Collection of additional data on FADs"
WCPFC14,385,"The Commission noted the need for FAD data to be provided by ROP observers for all vessels involved in FAD activities, including support vessels. High Seas transshipment reporting"
WCPFC14,386,The Chair invited FFA to introduce their paper WCPFC14-2017-DP09 Views on enhanced monitoring of longline vessels and transshipment activity. The FFA Secretariat responded and thanked the Chair for the opportunity but as the paper contained general views on issues discussed over the course of the meeting it did not need to be presented and any questions could be answered in the margins.
WCPFC14,387,"The Commission agreed that CCMs are to report observer coverage achieved for their carrier vessels conducting transshipment at sea, in line with the vessel specifications outlined in paragraph 13 of CMM 2009-06, in their Annual Report Part 2. 67  ERandEM IWG meeting in 2018"
WCPFC14,388,"The Chair asked for comments on the decision on whether to convene the ERandEM IWG meeting in 2018, noting that some FFA and PNA members had already expressed support for the meeting to be held next year immediately prior to SC14 (refer Agenda Item 9.1 SC13 Report)."
WCPFC14,389,Japan supported the ERandEM IWG meeting prior to SC14. It sought clarification on a point in the FFA Members paper WCPFC14-2017-DP09 Views on enhanced monitoring of longline vessels and transshipment activity that had suggested the topics of this meeting should include: “Consider development of standards for e-reporting applications in port monitoring and links with e-CDS development.” Japan confirmed it had no objection to the meeting but sought clarification about this point.  It recalled during TCC13 there were discussions related to how electronic monitoring could be counted as meeting observer coverage was a topic that was suggested to be included in ERandEM-IWG meeting. Japan sought clarification about what the agenda for the ERandEM IWG meeting would include.
WCPFC14,390,"Kerry Smith, speaking in her capacity as Chair of ERandEM IWG, confirmed that a draft agenda for the meeting was a matter that she had been considering and working on in consultation with the Secretariat.  She confirmed that her expectation based on discussions at TCC13 and informal discussions to date, was that how E-monitoring can be taken forward as a data collection tool in this Commission would be the focus of the 2018 meeting.  As Chair of the ERandEM IWG, she noted the adoption of ER standards for operational logbook catch and effort data by the Commission last year, and the further consideration for adoption at this meeting of draft ER standards for observer data to be fundamental to being able to progress work on electronic monitoring standards.  Members were thanked for their contributions to finalise the ER standards that had been made to date.  If the Commission did agree to a meeting of the ERandEM IWG taking place in 2018, she intended to circulate a draft agenda early in the year that has a focus on E-monitoring.  She would welcome comments and suggestions of any other topics that might be covered at that meeting."
WCPFC14,391,"New Caledonia confirmed it had no objection to the FFA proposal or the suggestion to consider E-monitoring and E-reporting perspectives in the Commission.  It did want to make sure that improving electronic monitoring standards, necessarily includes improvements of the efficiency of the E-monitoring technology."
WCPFC14,392,Japan commented that based on the ERandEM IWG Chair’s explanation about the priority topics for the meeting CCMs may need to consider sending administrative staff rather than scientists given the substance of the meeting. It confirmed it was happy to go along with consensus if other CCMs prefer the meeting is held with SC14.
WCPFC14,393,"The Commission agreed to hold a meeting of the ERandEM IWG in 2018, immediately prior to SC14. E-reporting standards for observer data"
WCPFC14,394,"The European Union commented on the TCC13 recommendation that recommends the draft E-reporting standards for observer data be considered for adoption (TCC13 Summary Report paragraph 177).  The European Union recalled that at WCPFC13, at the time that the E-reporting standards for operational level catch and effort data had been adopted, it had requested the inclusion of language that gave recognition to the UN/CEFACT’s FLUX standards.  It was an important issue for the European Union to ensure that E-reporting standards for the WCPFC align with the UN standards which are the standards that all European Union fishing vessels applied to their operations.  It reiterated that this point had been made for several years that it was important to ensure consistency and compatibility between WCPFC and UN standards.  The European Union sought clarification as to whether the proposal in WCPFC14-2017-20 Draft standards E-reporting of observer data had duly 68  considered and recognised the UN/CEFACT’s FLUX standards as it appeared not to have done so.  It was further suggested that if these draft standards are adopted in their current form, the European Union would ask that an allowance is made for vessels using UN/CEFACT’s FLUX standards to be allowed to continue to report observer data using these standards."
WCPFC14,395,"Japan confirmed that regarding the E-reporting standards for observer data it had communicated with SPC following TCC13, and their comments along with those of Chinese Taipei were able to be further discussed and duly considered in WCPFC14-2017-20.  They expressed regret if the draft e-reporting standards for observer data were not able to be adopted at this meeting."
WCPFC14,396,"Fiji speaking on behalf of FFA Members, confirmed their support for the adoption of the draft E-reporting standards for observer data. The draft E-reporting standards have undergone some substantial consultation with CCMs, and they thanked SPC for hard work on the development of these standards.  Fiji strongly urged the adoption of these draft E-reporting standards for observer data by the Commission."
WCPFC14,397,"The European Union confirmed that the concerns expressed were not new, and clarified that the E-reporting standards that are presently being used by European Union vessels are referred to within the draft standards to be “under development”.  The European Union had been raising this issue for two years. It reiterated that the intention of the European Union was not to oppose the adoption of these standards, but to ensure that the current standards used by the European Union vessels and which are international standards could continue to be used."
WCPFC14,398,"Peter Williams from SPC clarified that the draft E-reporting standards only really related to how observer data should be submitted to the WCPFC, and nothing more. The draft E-reporting standards, do not prevent nor prescribe the format for how data is captured or the software that are used.  The intention of the language used in the current E-reporting standards adopted last year, and the present draft E-reporting standards presented in WCPFC14-2017-20, was to reflect the present understanding that UN-CEFACT standards currently do not cater for all the ROP minimum data fields."
WCPFC14,399,"Australia thanked SPC and confirmed that it shared the same understanding of the purpose of the E-reporting standards.  It added that the E-reporting standards are intended to provide a basis for translation of data into WCPFC databases.  The E-reporting standards are simply replicating the current processes and minimum data fields, and relates to data that is currently being input into WCPFC databases.  The issue that is being discussed is an issue of a technical nature.  It concluded by noting that the adoption and publishing of the WCPFC E-reporting standards would provide an opportunity for the UN-CEFACT standard to include relevant minimum data fields so that it can be accommodated in the future."
WCPFC14,400,"The Chair confirmed that WCPFC14-2017-20_rev1 had been issued to the meeting, and that this revision took on board the earlier discussions."
WCPFC14,401,"The Commission adopted the E-reporting standards for observer data (WCPFC14-2017-20_rev1), and agreed to include them in the standards, specifications and procedures for Electronic Reporting which presently include E-reporting standards for operational catch and effort data (Attachment T). High Seas transshipment E-reporting implementation at the Secretariat"
WCPFC14,402,The Chair sought comments on WCPFC14-2017-21 Implementing E-reporting of high seas transshipment declaration and transshipment notices.  The Chair confirmed that the Secretariat was seeking an in-principle support from the Commission for their 2018 workplan in support of implementation of high seas transhipment E-reporting at the Secretariat.  It was also noted that the 69  workplan had budgetary implications that would be subject to a budgetary allocation being confirmed by FAC11.
WCPFC14,403,The European Union confirmed that they have been working with the Secretariat and FAC11 towards including in the 2018 budget provision of an additional workplan activity to accommodate inclusion of the UN/CEFACT’s FLUX standard.
WCPFC14,404,The Chair confirmed that the 2018 approved budget included a budgetary allocation that catered for both the Secretariats proposed workplan WCPFC14-2017-21 and the European Union’s request related to the UN/CEFACT’s FLUX standard.
WCPFC14,405,"The Commission noted the Secretariat paper WCPFC14-2017-21 that provided a set of draft standards for the E-reporting of high seas transhipment declarations and transhipment notices taking into consideration the requirements of CMM 2009-06 Annex I and Annex III.  The Commission agreed that vessels could additionally use the UN/CEFACT’s FLUX standard for the e-reporting of high seas transhipment declarations and notices, subject to the information provided complying with the requirements of CMM 2009-06.  The Commission endorsed in principle the Secretariats proposed workplan for 2018 as set out in WCPFC14-2017-21, and noted that FAC11, in addition to supporting the 2018 budget request, had allocated additional funding for the Secretariat to include in its 2018 workplan consideration of the UN/CEFACT’s FLUX standard in the implementation of E-reporting of high seas transhipment declarations and transhipment notices.   Port Coordinators Programme"
WCPFC14,406,"The Chair noted the Commission needed to take a decision on the port coordinators programme. Members were invited to comment on the extension of this programme, noting that the report on the trial Port Coordinators program was provided in WCPFC14-2017-22."
WCPFC14,407,"The European Union considered this programme valuable, however at previous meetings it had asked for more information on the programme’s benefits and how it contributed to better data collection, sampling and implementation. TCC13 did not have any further information to consider, as no reports were submitted. As no new information had been provided, the European Union was not in a position to confirm future funding, especially when considering the budgetary constraints of the Commission. It would require more information to change this position."
WCPFC14,408,"Kiribati, on behalf of FFA Members, supported the extension of the Port Coordinators’ Programme noting it had provided useful support to some participant CCMs’ national port activities. The programme had contributed significantly to improving CCMs capacity to undertake transhipment monitoring in ports and also improving the training of observers. Port controls were promoted by many CCMs as being a critical part of the overall MCS framework. FFA Members were committed to strengthening measures and a flexible, nationally tailored program of assistance that FFA members could choose to participate in was considered an important contribution. Regarding reporting, FFA Members noted that participant CCMs had provided reports on the implementation of the programme. If extended, participating members would continue to report on their national implementation of the assistance provided, providing details on their respective outcomes and benefits."
WCPFC14,409,The Chair concluded that there was no agreement to extend the programme and the Commission would simply note the report WCPFC14-2017-22. Funding for the Global Consolidated list of Authorised Vessels (CLAV) 70
WCPFC14,410,"The United States noted an update on a TCC-related initiative, specifically on the Consolidated List of Authorised Vessels which was a joint tuna RFMO initiative that provides a single global register that consolidates data on all vessels operating in the tuna RFMOs. The initiative was established and is presently being maintained through funding by the FAO Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (Common Oceans) Project.  The United States advised that it understood that funding for the CLAV is due to run out in 2019.  It further proposed that it would be helpful for the Commission to consider tasking the TCC and FAC with reviewing the utility of this initiative and consider any associated funding needs for this. The FAO was looking for individual tuna RFMOs contributions to the programme, and perhaps contributions might be based on proportionate number of vessels each RFMO has on their list."
WCPFC14,411,The Commission noted that the funding for the technical support to the global consolidated list of authorised fishing vessels would end in 2019.  The TCC and FAC were tasked at the 2018 meetings to review the utility of the CLAV and provide advice to WCPFC15. WCPFC approved ALC/MTU list and VMS reporting
WCPFC14,412,"Palau advised WCPFC14 that FFA Members were seriously concerned with the continued weak stance the Commission has taken with respect to ALC/MTU models that do not meet the WCPFC mandatory VMS reporting requirements. The Secretariat had repeatedly recommended that Argos units be removed from the list of approved ALC/MTU types. The justification for the removal of the four Argos units was clear. These units were providing position reports greater than 90 minutes after being sent from the MTU, and therefore do not meet Annex 1 CMM 2014-02 requirements. In some cases, reporting delays can be up to 14 hours. This delay was considered unacceptable. FFA Members felt that TCC13’s recommendation that CCMs ensure their flagged vessels do not “purchase, install or transfer” these Argos units was not strong enough. And any extended or ambiguous phase-out period was unacceptable. FFA Members sought a decision by the Commission to i) remove these three Argos units from the list of approved ALC/MTU types; and ii) require any relevant CCMs to ensure their flagged vessels have WCPFC type-approved units installed and operational by December 2018."
WCPFC14,413,"Australia supported the recommendation made by Palau and FFA Members for the Commission to take a decision on this issue and noted that the Commission was required to take a decision on an appropriate timeframe for the phase out, as referred to in paragraphs 135-137 of the TCC13 Summary Report. It acknowledged that the VMS was a fundamental tool for supporting MCS operations and such lengthy reporting delays had significant operational and cost implications. FFA Members have strongly supported the Secretariat’s recommendation to remove these units from the WCPFC list for the last two years. The VMS CMM (CMM 2014-02) was a key WCPFC measure and the Commission adopted its CMMs on good faith and on the understanding that CCMs had a duty to implement them. There may be times when a reasonable delay to implementation was necessary to accommodate changes in business practices but the continued use of MTUs that do not meet WCPFC standards and without a clear plan or commitment to phase these units out was a serious concern for this delegation. Australia will continue to focus on VMS compliance as part of our HSBI activities in the Pacific region."
WCPFC14,414,"Japan thanked FFA members for raising this matter.  As Japan explained at TCC13, it fully understood that the Argos units did not satisfy the minimum requirement of CMM 2014-02, and for this reason at TCC13 it had joined the consensus on agreeing to delete these units from the WCPFC approved list.  However, its difficulty is for its fisherman that already purchased these units, and particularly those that have done so in recent times, during the period that the units were included on the WCPFC approved list.  Japan confirmed that it had undertaken an analysis and on average these units were used for 10 years and the last one was brought in April 2016. Japan preferred to allow the fishers time to use these units, so it proposed a phase out starting 8 years after the closure of WCPFC14. 71"
WCPFC14,415,"China noted it had a similar problem to that described by Japan for its fleet.  China supported the Japan proposal for a phase out period of eight years, by 2025."
WCPFC14,416,"Tokelau reminded the Commission that the removal of these units had been recommended by the WCPFC Secretariat for two years now. CCMs should agree to remove the Argos units from the list of WCPFC approved units, and to replace them in a timely fashion. Reporting violations were the most significant IUU threat to Pacific tuna fisheries and FFA Members took this matter very seriously. As mentioned by Palau, VMS reporting delays from vessels using Argos units can be as long as 14 hours. This reporting violation was a clear example of IUU activity that Pacific Islands Countries are working hard to eliminate. If no Commission decision was made to remove and replace these non-compliant units, FFA Members would commence actively reviewing vessels that have these units installed. Any vessel found not reporting according to the agreed parameters will be considered for listing under the IUU Vessel List. This approach sought to maintain the agreed reporting standards established by the Commission by ensuring vessels did not continue to undermine the provisions of the VMS CMM."
WCPFC14,417,"The United States shared the views highlighting the seriousness of having so many vessels using non-compliant systems. It was critical that vessels use type approved units sooner. WCPFC12 discussed this in depth and agreed on a compromise: once a VMS unit type was removed from the approved list, vessels would only be allowed to use those units for three years. At WCPFC13, Members came back unhappy with that agreed three year compromise. Unless there was new and extraordinary information on why this already agreed compromise would not work, the United States remained convinced that the three year period was the most appropriate way forward."
WCPFC14,418,"Indonesia confirmed its vessels still used Argos units, as well as another type of MTU that was not in the WCPFC approved list.  It confirmed that it was not easy to replace VMS systems, and there are replacement costs.  For Indonesia, it is unclear if these replacement costs would be assumed by government or industry and this remains a matter that must be resolved internally."
WCPFC14,419,"Canada was supportive of further progress on this issue. It did not have vessels operating in the WCPO area, but spoke to this issue at TCC13 and noted it had been discussed for some time and in the meanwhile new non-compliant units has been purchased by certain fleets. Accordingly, there were two issues to resolve. Firstly, that there was not another year of operators buying units that did not meet Commission standards; and secondly, agreement on the phase out period of existing non-compliant units."
WCPFC14,420,"Australia clarified that the Commission was presently considering whether to remove non-compliant units from the WCPFC approved MTU list. The phase out period remained undecided, though Australia could support a period of three years. It thanked the Secretariat for Annual VMS report that is submitted to TCC, and asked for future papers to include the number of vessels reporting from Argos units to track changes in the number of these units being used per year to demonstrate if the usage of non-compliant MTUs was actually decreasing over time."
WCPFC14,421,"The Chair summarised that the TCC13 recommendation had included an additional recommendation for a date on when those units should be phased out, so the Commission needed to agree on when that should occur. The United States noted a three year phase out provision had already been agreed, which would start from now if the Commission decided to remove those non-compliant units at this meeting. Chair noted Japan and China suggestion that eight years was more appropriate for them.  The Chair asked that Australia work with interested parties to further discuss the issue."
WCPFC14,422,The Chair advised that Australia had tabled a draft outcome for consideration in WCPFC14-2017-DP31 and a discussion ensued.
WCPFC14,423,The Commission approved the addition of the Triton Advance MTU and Skymate I1500 VMS to the WCPFC approved ALC/MTU list.   72
WCPFC14,424,"The Commission agreed that CCMs shall ensure that vessels flying their flag do not purchase, install or transfer the following VMS units: FVT, MAR GE, MAR GE V2, and MAR GE V3 (all Argos units) and that they be removed from the WCPFC approved ALC/MTU list. The Commission further agreed that existing units on vessels shall be allowed to continue to operate for 5 years (until 1 January 2023). CCMs whose vessels use these models shall provide a list of vessels that are using the units to the Secretariat and shall update the list annually."
WCPFC14,425,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat to coordinate, as necessary, with the VMS service provider to provide additional functionality in its 'Commission VMS-reporting status tool' in a web-based, exportable matrix. The new tool should separately, in addition to the data listed in the current tool, provide authorized flag CCM MCS entities each of their vessel's daily VMS-reporting status (how many position reports are transmitted by each vessel on each date), and determine and display a generic vessel status ('in port' or 'at sea', for example). Historical Record of Fishing Vessels (RFV) data"
WCPFC14,426,"Australia indicated that it wished to discuss access to historical data for the Record of Fishing Vessels, referring to paragraph 239 of the TCC13 Summary Report.  Australia on behalf of FFA Members noted the Secretariat’s update at TCC13 regarding its work to develop mechanisms to access and analyse historical information from the RFV. At TCC13, there was limited discussion of these developments. FFA Members provided the following responses to questions raised by the Secretariat at TCC13: i) FFA members considered historical RFV information as part of the RFV and, as such, should be considered “public domain information” in accordance with the WCPFC data access rules and procedures. This included related fields on fishing/non-fishing and interim lists of Non-Member Carrier and Bunker Vessels. ii) FFA Members requested that the RFV file in full should be periodically updated and made available for download from the WCPFC website until an automated extraction functionality was made available. iii) FFA Members considered this data as ‘historical data’ and it should not be subject to any revision by any party, unless associated arrangements for documentation and verification of changes could be agreed."
WCPFC14,427,The Chair clarified that the paper by the Secretariat to TCC13 provided an update on mechanisms that it had developed to disseminate historical RFV data.  The Secretariat welcomed the response to its questions and confirmed that it did not have anything further to add.
WCPFC14,428,"The Commission noted the Secretariat’s update at TCC13 regarding its work to develop mechanisms to access and analyse historical information from the Record of Fishing Vessels, and that there was limited discussion of these developments during TCC13.  The Commission thanked the Secretariat for its update, and agreed that: i. historical RFV information should be considered part of the Record of Fishing Vessels and, as such, should be considered “public domain information” in accordance with the WCPFC data access rules and procedures. This includes related fields on fishing/non-fishing and interim lists of Non-Member Carrier and Bunker vessels. ii. the Record of Fishing Vessels file in full should be periodically updated by the Secretariat and made available for download from the WCPFC website until an automated extraction functionality is made available; iii. this data should be considered as ‘historical data’ and it should not be subject to any revision by any party, unless associated arrangements for documentation and verification of changes can be agreed. 73  High Seas Boarding and Inspection The Commission tasked the Secretariat to make the list of vessels previously inspected under the HSBI scheme, published https://www.wcpfc.int/ccm/hsbi-report, exportable in MS Excel and CSV format to authorised CCM users. TCC14 ‘plastic bottle’ free"
WCPFC14,429,The Commission agreed to the TCC13 recommendation that TCC14 be 'plastic bottle' free. TCC13 Summary report
WCPFC14,430,The Commission adopted the report of TCC13 (WCPFC14-2017-TCC13). AGENDA ITEM 10 – COMPLIANCE MONITORING SCHEME 10.1 Consideration and Adoption of the Final Compliance Monitoring Report
WCPFC14,431,"The Commission considered the provisional Compliance Monitoring Report recommended by TCC13 and additional information provided by CCMs. WCPFC14’s consideration of the provisional Compliance Monitoring Report took place in a small working group led by the TCC Chair, which compiled the final Compliance Monitoring Report for adoption."
WCPFC14,432,"The TCC Chair provided a report to the Commission on the outcome of the SWG and the following points were highlighted: • WCPFC14 undertook its seventh annual review of compliance by CCMs against an updated priority list of Commission obligations agreed to at WCPFC13 for 2016 – 2018. (Attachment I to WCPFC13 Summary Report).  • WCPFC14 and TCC13 conducted its review in accordance with the revised Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS) adopted at WCPFC12 – CMM 2015-07. Unlike past versions of the CMS, the current CMS did not require an overall assessment of each CCM, but only asked WCPFC to identify a compliance assessment for each specific obligation.   • A number of CCMs provided additional information between TCC13 and WCPFC14. A small working group met in closed session during WCPFC14 to review and evaluate the additional information, and was chaired by TCC Chair Alexa Cole (United States). The small working group considered all additional information, including for CCMs not present at the working group meetings.   • After considering the additional information, the small working group was unable to assess five obligations for certain CCMs contained in the following measures: CMM 2009-03, para 2, CMM 2015-01, para 14, CMM 2014-02, paras 9a and SSPs 2.8, Convention Article 25 (2), and SciData 03.  • In accordance with Annex I of the CMS CMM, the following statuses were considered in making the assessments: Compliant, Non-Compliant, Priority Non-Compliant, Capacity Assistance Needed, Flag State Investigation and CMM Review."
WCPFC14,433,"The TCC Chair expressed her gratitude to Dr Lara Manarangi-Trott and ‘Ana Taholo from the Secretariat and to Peter Williams and Graham Pilling from SPC, noting their significant contribution to the implementation and development of the compliance scheme over many years. She 74  observed that it was important to note that when considering the future of the CMS and in the development of a revised measure, that CCMs did not lose sight of the significant progress the Commission had made over the years and especially how delegates had transformed into very sophisticated and highly engaged participants in the scheme, compared with early meetings."
WCPFC14,434,"The Chair acknowledged the work of the Secretariat and SPC, and further thanked them and the TCC Chair on their continued collective efforts to drive the compliance process forward and find efficiencies."
WCPFC14,435,The European Union sought clarification on some aspects noting that it was unable to participate in all sessions of the CMR-SWG due to its small delegation. New Zealand noted that FFA Members would also welcome the opportunity to talk with the TCC Chair about a couple of issues in the final draft CMR.
WCPFC14,436,"Canada provided a general comment on the Compliance Monitoring Scheme and its outcomes.  They noted their primary interest is in the Northern stocks and confirmed that there were no Canadian flagged fishing vessels in the Convention Area for 2016. In reflecting on the Compliance Monitoring Scheme outcomes, Canada admitted that on occasion being somewhat puzzled and perplexed at the outcomes.  Canada despite having no fishing vessels operating in the Convention Area was deemed non-compliant. In making this point, Canada confirmed that it does accept this outcome, because the non-compliant scores related to missed reporting deadlines and recently there have been some fields on the RFV that are incomplete.  Canada noted though that the outcome for the WCPFC VMS requirements also provides a puzzling outcome in the Compliance Monitoring Scheme.  The requirements for VMS are clearly specified in the Convention in Article 24 (paragraphs 8 and 9) and they are clearly a flag State responsibility.  Yet the four elements that are reviewed in this year’s Compliance Monitoring Report (covering 2016 activities) have either provided CCMs with fully compliant scores or the Commission has not been able to assess the obligations.  These outcomes in the final CMR is despite there being data and information that was discussed openly here at this meeting, that confirmed that some MTU units that are presently being used in the region have a delay of up to 14 hours.  It also is aware of information that confirms that vessels have been inspected on the high seas and were confirmed to be using a VMS that is not reporting to WCPFC VMS.  Considering these points, Canada urged that when the review of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme is further examined, that the Commission should look more broadly at how the Commission is doing its business in general, and the Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMM necessary to be able to support the decisions of the Commission, and for this Commission to be able to provide clear advice on monitoring, control and surveillance."
WCPFC14,437,"Vanuatu noticed that it is still listed in the Final Compliance Monitoring Report with a “capacity assistance needed” score.  It confirmed that its capacity need has been addressed, and it asked that the final report is corrected to reflect this."
WCPFC14,438,"The Commission adopted the Final Compliance Monitoring Report (WCPFC14-2017-finalCMR), and the Chair thanked the TCC Chair for her work in leading the SWG."
WCPFC14,439,"The Commission accepted the Final Compliance Monitoring Report (WCPFC14-2017-finalCMR, Attachment U).  10.2 Update on the Independent Review of Compliance Monitoring Scheme"
WCPFC14,440,"The Chair opened discussions, noting that the Secretariat had provided paper WCPFC14-2017-25A, Update on the Independent Review of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme, as an update on the progress of the Independent Review of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS). The paper was noted to contain a suggested process to facilitate and support the CCMs consideration of the Report 75  from the CMS Review, following the Reports submission at the end of February 2018 and before it is tabled at WCPFC15."
WCPFC14,441,"The Chair referred the meeting to WCPFC14-2017-25B Independent Review of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme: Substantive Progress Report by the Review Panel, which updated Members on the progress of the Review and a large number of issues that have been identified."
WCPFC14,442,"The Independent Review Panel, Chair Mr Don Mackay, Dr Chris Rogers and Mr Andrew Wright were then invited to present an update on the independent review of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme.  The Panel confirmed its understanding from the terms of reference that the expected output from the Review would be “an assessment of the efficacy of current structure of the CMS, and to be forward looking in providing suggestions for improvement”. The Review commenced work in June, and undertook research and initial consultations through August, including holding a meeting that was supported by the Secretariat and where some conference calls with key CCM representatives were arranged.  During September the Don and Chris observed the TCC13 session, and had consultation with a number of participants.  In December, the Review panel observed the WCPFC14 session and had continued consultations with participants.  In March 2018 the Report is to be submitted.  Each of the Review Panel members then contributed to the presentation, which intended to present some initial thoughts of the Panel as contained in WCPFC14-2017-25B as well as some ideas to stimulate further consultation and encourage further input.  The Panel was also looking to participants to assist them in identifying gaps and issues in the report to date."
WCPFC14,443,"Andrew Wright presented an overview of the Panels understanding of how the CMS is contributing to the work of the Commission.  Points that were noted in the presentation of matters related to contributions made included: improved submission of Annual Reporting since the commencement of the CMS; information sharing/shared appreciation of challenges associated with obligations; greater attention to CMM drafting to be clearer about matters of interpretation and strengthening of reporting deadlines; improved information/data availability for example operational level catch and effort data submission had improved; better utilisation by the Commission of data submitted under CMMs and other CMS sanctioned sources of information.  The capacity development plan and flag State investigation scores were noted to be positive recently included components of the CMS, but it was noted that capacity development plans need to be appropriately resourced and harmonised with other similar initiatives.  Institutionally, the CCMs were receiving positive support through the commission in the form of the Information Management System (IMS), and there was demonstrated significant investment at the national level to monitor, report and engage in the CMS process.  Secretariat was noted to be very responsive and proactive in servicing CCMs’ CMS requirements, and their hard work and efforts deserve acknowledgement."
WCPFC14,444,"Chris Rogers presented an overview of the Panel’s findings in respect of issues that have arisen in the discussions to date, including CCMs concerns.  The presentation was divided into three areas, and questions set out for each area: i) Effectiveness – does the current CMS enable the WCPFC to achieve its conservation and management objectives? Some of the points identified included: the potential of the CMS appears yet to be realised as many CMM requirements have changed since CMS was introduced, it was difficult to gauge the impact of Capacity Development Plans and there may be other factors, such as the absence of consequences for non-compliance, that mask the capacity-related compliance deficiencies.  ii) Efficiency – are the resources that are applied to the current CMS sufficient to achieve objectives? Are the resource demands excessive or incorrectly applied?  Some of the points identified included: the current CMS is resource demanding, the number of CMMs and level of detail subject to audit is resource/time consuming, lack of focus of the CMS on most serious issues of non-compliance, focus on detailed assessments precludes strategic focus on major issues, and holdover of unresolved CMS matters from the TCC meeting impacts the work of the Commission.  iii) Procedural fairness – are CCMs assessed fairly and consistently with regard to compliance with CMM obligations?  Does the outcome of the CMS process assist all CCMs in achieving compliance? Some of the points identified included: some significant challenges in assessing compliance in certain situations; ambiguity in CMM interpretation; adequate notices of potential compliance deficiencies 76  and opportunity to prepare responses; practicality of implementation of a CMM and expected remedial response; inconsistent compliance assessments across CCMs with similar situations and clarity needed in expectations for reporting Flag State Investigation status."
WCPFC14,445,"Don MacKay concluded with some of the considerations of the Panel in looking forward. First, it was noted that the Commission needed to reduce the burden of material that CCMs need to provide, particularly where duplicates information already provided and focus should also be on information which contributes to management decisions.  It was important to reduce the volume of material to be discussed in TCC and focus on what is important, rather than minutiae, and consider the introduction of a pre-screening process as in ICCAT. Second, it was important to clarify the requirements under CMMs, including reporting requirements and to provide a longer development time for CMMs, including drafting processes.  Part of the work that should be started is a review of existing CMMs for relevance, and clarity, with a 2-year moratorium on new (non-urgent) CMMs to provide time for this.  Third, in respect of capacity building proposals, it was clear that the present system and implementation need to be improved and further consideration needed to be given to other proposals to enhance training and assistance.  Fourth, fairness, effectiveness and efficiency issues at a broader level, requires common standards and means of assessment across all fisheries.  There is an issue of procedural fairness (“natural justice”) and CCMs need to be clearly and fully informed about allegations of non-compliance, given opportunity fully to put their case, against previously established criteria for assessment and given a fair “hearing” by others, without unfairness or bias, and on a consistent basis with all.  Finally, there was a need to address responses to non-compliance and a suggestion at least as an interim measure of a CCSBT Quality Assurance Review (QAR) type system in response to serious or systemic failures.  Such an approach would both assist CCMs in question to identify any issues, and be a process for recommendations to be made, and be done with a view to assisting CCMs rather than “sanctioning” them.  The Panel concluded noting that the presentation and the table in WCPFC14-2017-25B were still a work in progress and they welcomed feedback and further thoughts."
WCPFC14,446,"The Chair reminded delegates that the Final Report of the Independent Review Panel would be submitted in March 2018 which was in the Commission’s intersessional period. Accordingly, there was a need to consider how CCMs wanted to take this forward.  The Chair welcomed comments on this work but reiterated that the Panel was available in the margins of this meeting if CCMs had specific comments to be incorporated into the Review Panel Report."
WCPFC14,447,"Canada thanked the Panel for the information provided in the interim report and found the presentation useful. Canada considered this organisation as a teenager; on the process side there was a fairly solid process running, but at the strategic level there was much opportunity to make progress. This valuable work put the organisation in a good position to move ahead and better plan for the future. On the issue of how the Commission should consider the Panel’s Final Report, it suggested assigning that work to the next TCC meeting for consideration. TCC14 could also assess and develop a work plan to address various recommendations coming from the Review Panel which could then be considered at WCPFC15."
WCPFC14,448,"Tokelau on behalf of FFA Members thanked the Panel for their hard work on the review of the CMS and for their progress report. FFA Members provided their preliminary views in WCPFC14-2017-DP06 prior to the submission of the progress report. FFA Members confirmed that they had submitted another Delegation Paper WCPFC14-2017-DP28 setting out their detailed response to some of the issues raised in the progress report by the Panel (WCPFC14-2017-25B). They outlined the following general comments:  • The need to explicitly cover audit points in the design of each CMM, resource considerations, clear reporting requirements and how compliance will be assessed; 77  • It was essential for the Scheme to recognise and address two key fundamental areas (i) the need to build capacity, and to do so in a manner that complements existing national processes and (ii) the need to ensure that the Scheme was procedurally fair and produced fair outcomes;  • There was a clear need to improve the CMS in order to ensure that it was robust, fair, transparent and efficient, and produced meaningful assessments in a timely manner to inform management decisions; • The current CMS has become a long, drawn out process and unsustainable, and it would be critical to revisit the timing of review processes and the current list of obligations to be assessed; • It was essential to clarify the scope of the Scheme such that it properly and fairly assesses implementation of CCM obligations, including meeting flag State responsibilities; and • That a process needs to be set up to commence the development of remedial responses which help countries work towards compliance. Furthermore, in looking at the operation of the existing process over the last few years, it was clear to FFA Members that some of these points would demand redesign of the CMS that goes beyond mere tweaks to the existing measure. FFA members confirmed that they looked forward to further discussions with the Panel to ensure CMS improvements."
WCPFC14,449,"WWF on behalf of WWF, ISSF, International Pole and Line Foundation, International Environmental Law Project, Pew Charitable Trusts, Greenpeace and Sustainable Fisheries Partnership thanked the consultants on the comprehensive amount of work completed to date, and they appreciated the opportunity to provide feedback into the process. They were curious as to whether consultants had considered some of the issues of transparency in the process and particularly the admission of observers into the process.  They said that there has been a spirit of consideration to look into processes, and noted there has been a bit of backsliding in the process of developing the tropical tuna measure and the compliance monitoring scheme in general. It welcomed the Review Panels consideration and recommendations on these aspects for the CMS and the Commission going forward."
WCPFC14,450,"Don McKay responded that the Panel had received comments on the need to develop a possible way forward to address the need for greater transparency in this organisation and there is a section in the paper providing a suggestion of how this might be addressed. Comments were received confirming support for greater transparency, on the other hand there were comments received suggesting that the system needed to develop further before it could be fully open. The Panel’s advice was that it was important to address the issue of transparency, in recognition that civil society organisation made an important contribution to an organisation over time and over a number of areas. One possibility identified by the Panel in the paper was a suggestion for CCMs to include members of civil society on their delegations.  It was noted that whilst such a suggestion was not formally transparent and only in a limited area, in practice there was significant level of transparency that could be provided. The Panel looked forward to receiving further feedback on that approach as well as others."
WCPFC14,451,"Australia thanked the Panel for the comprehensive initial report and looked forward to their Final Report. Regarding Canada’s proposal on what TCC might need to consider next year.  On behalf of FFA Members, it advised that these CCMs were hoping next year’s TCC would consider what a future WCPFC Compliance Monitoring Scheme might start to look like.  It clarified that this was the basis for FFA Members’ suggestion that a reduced list of obligations be considered at next year’s TCC, with a view to freeing up space to consider what a draft CMS CMM might look like.  It urged that this meeting consider the process of how a draft measure for CMS would be developed over 2018 and in advance of TCC, rather than only considering a process of considering the recommendations of the Panel’s final report."
WCPFC14,452,New Zealand further noted that FFA Members had been discussing what such processes might look like mindful of the timeframes agreed to at the next Commission meeting. WCPFC14 could 78  appoint a CCM to develop and distribute a draft CMM to members before SC14. Advice could then be incorporated for formal consideration at TCC13. FFA Members would like to have the Republic of the Marshall Islands considered to lead that process.
WCPFC14,453,"The European Union also thanked the Panel, though it was still of the opinion that the Review was premature as the current CMS CMM had not been in place for long. It was therefore difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the measure because some concepts within it were still relatively new. Postponing the review for one more year might have been better as there had been three CMS CMMs developed in the last five years. Now there was a proposal from FFA Members to develop another measure at the next meeting, which seemed rushed."
WCPFC14,454,"The European Union could clearly support the intention to improve the CMS. It also attached a lot of importance to the issue of transparency. It also supported consideration of the Panel’s final report recommendations as suggested by Canada, but noted this process needed to be guided. TCC14 could look into the findings of the report thoroughly, and then a discussion paper could be tabled at WCPFC15."
WCPFC14,455,"The United States thanked the Panel for the helpful analysis of the issues heard around the room over the year. The United States was sensitive to the comments of the European Union and FFA Members, and thought the Commission needed to give some priority to developing a solid CMS measure. The work to revise the CMS should at least begin this year and should not wait until the final report was submitted to the Commission formally at the next annual session. It appreciated the offer of Republic of the Marshall Islands to lead that work."
WCPFC14,456,"The Republic of the Marshall Islands appreciated the Panel’s work. It welcomed guidance by other CCMs on how to proceed as the current CMS CMM was due to lapse. Moving forward there needed to be an acknowledgment that the measures adopted over the years had not been a level playing field and had been quite challenging for SIDS. Any new or revised measures should be designed specifically for the unique challenges of this Commission to ensure the fishery was well managed. It was thankful for the nomination from New Zealand and other FFA Members, and while shy about leading this work it was an issue very important to them."
WCPFC14,457,The Republic of Korea expressed deep gratitude to the Panel for its very well-structured progress report. It was pleased its views were reflected in that report and that a comprehensive analysis had been provided covering eleven areas. It suggested that it would be helpful if a gap analysis of individual legal systems to implement existing CMMs and other obligations could also be incorporated.
WCPFC14,458,The Chair summarised that based on the discussions to date there were two options that had received support.  First that the TCC is tasked to consider the Review Report recommendations.  Second that an intersessional working group is tasked with developing a draft CMM for consideration at TCC.
WCPFC14,459,"Australia expressed their preference for the second option and noted that under this approach, it felt that the Review Report would likely receive consideration through the intersessional working groups work as well as during TCC at the time that the IWG presents its report of progress.  It felt that this provided the best opportunity to ensure that a draft CMM on the CMS would be developed through 2018."
WCPFC14,460,Canada confirmed that an intersessional discussion would be a helpful way to consider the priorities and approaches to addressing the issues identified in the Review.
WCPFC14,461,The Commission agreed to establish an Intersessional Working Group on the Review of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS IWG).  The tasks of the Intersessional Working Group will be to facilitate consideration of the Report from the Independent Review of the 79  Compliance Monitoring Scheme (due by March 2018) and develop a proposed Conservation and Management Measure for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme for consideration at WCPFC15.  The Commission also decided that Republic of Marshall Islands would lead the Intersessional Working Group.   10.3 Expiry of CMM 2015-07 at the end of 2017
WCPFC14,462,"The Chair opened discussions on the expiration of CMM 2015-07 on the Compliance Monitoring Scheme which expires at the end of 2017, and noted that TCC13 discussed this but did not have a consensus recommendation, with a majority recommending to extend the existing measure."
WCPFC14,463,"The Republic of Marshall Islands noted it was regrettable that TCC13 could not agree on a recommendation to WCPFC14 on the expiration of CMM 2015-07 at the end of 2017. It inquired in absence of consensus, what would be the options moving forward."
WCPFC14,464,The Chair reiterated the need for the Commission to decide on a way forward with this measure as it would expire at the end of December 2017. TCC13 discussed the issue but could not agree on whether to extend the measure for 2018 though a majority of CCMs supported a one-year extension.
WCPFC14,465,The European Union strongly supported the continuation of the current measure. It expressed that it would be very worrying if the Commission did not have a framework to continue its compliance monitoring.
WCPFC14,466,"Australia on behalf of FFA Members referred to the views of FFA members that are contained in WCPFC14-2017-DP06 Views on Independent Audit of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme.  FFA Members could agree to rollover CMM 2015-07 for one year only based on two conditions. Firstly, that far less time, preferably one day, was given to the CMR process at TCC14 to assess a much-reduced and high-priority set of CMMs including: the Record of Fishing Vessels; Vessel Monitoring System; Regional Observer Programme; transhipment; tropical tuna; south Pacific albacore; Pacific bluefin tuna; Scientific Data rules. This would allow for a reasonable amount of time to prioritise work on a revised CMS measure, taking into account the recommendations of the independent review. Secondly, that the duplicative reporting burden specific to scientific data was addressed at this Commission meeting. FFA Members sought the support of all Commission members in addressing these key criteria.  In the more detailed delegation paper WCPFC14-2017-DP28, CCMs were asked to take due note that FFA members have highlighted the significant concerns they have with the current system and they requested that CCMs take due note that FFA support to a decision to allow a one-year roll-over has come at significant discomfort. FFA stated that it is incumbent on all CCMs to approach the redesign of the CMM next year in an open manner to address the concerns so as not to risk cessation of the Scheme beyond 2018."
WCPFC14,467,"Japan noted that it was one of the CCMs that blocked consensus at TCC13. It clarified that its intention at TCC13 was not to stop the Compliance Monitoring Scheme, rather it opposed a simple roll-over because a review was necessary.  After reviewing the Independent Panel consultant report, it confirmed that it was able to join consensus for the rollover of the scheme. Regarding FFA members conditions for the rollover, Japan supported focusing only on high priority set of CMMs for the CMR process at TCC14noting that it saw benefit to both SIDS and all CCMs.  As far as the proposal was for one-year application, Japan confirmed it could support the proposed approach of FFA members.  On the second condition, it indicated some discomfort with CCMs not submitting Annual Report Part 2. This report was seen as an important record that all CCMs should submit annually as a declaration confirming the CCMs annual implementation of measures.   80"
WCPFC14,468,"Solomon Islands delivered a statement on behalf of PNA members, in support of the FFA position in DP06. PNA members agree to a one-year roll-over of CMM 2015-07, on condition that the CMR work at TCC13 is much reduced and the reporting burdens are reduced."
WCPFC14,469,The European Union was concerned about the statements from PNA and FFA members. It seemed that either WCPFC14 agreed to their conditions or there could be no agreement to allow for the measure to rollover. It reminded CCMs that it was important to have a CMS measure in place.
WCPFC14,470,"The United States shared the sentiments expressed by Japan and to a certain extent by the European Union. It was comfortable with the list of obligations proposed for inclusion in the CMS next year in the FFA paper as it made sense to reduce the time spent on the CMS process.  The United States could not agree to the discussions being limited to only one day, but it could consider a more limited list of obligations for 2018 CMS, noting that this would likely reduce the length of time ordinarily spent at TCC for CMR reviews. It was concerned with the second condition of the rollover that the duplicative reporting requirements be eliminated, whilst it could see that reporting was burdensome to SIDS, they are also burdensome to all other CCMs, to the Secretariat to SPC-OFP and to TCC. Given this, it proposed that some work be undertaken to address duplicative reporting and that this be a recommendation from this meeting to ensure that progress is made.  It indicated that some specific language that provided softer consideration in recognition of the burdensome nature of reporting to SIDS could be considered, but confirmed that the language set out in DP06 was too broad based and unclear for it to be acceptable in its current form.  It was open to further discussions, but needed clearer language to be formulated."
WCPFC14,471,Samoa responded by noting there were several implications of the CMS on the small islands developing states and the intention was to provide an opportunity to address those implications.  The idea being that over the next twelve months small islands developing states would require adequate time to fully address those issues of concern.
WCPFC14,472,The Chair noted there was broad support for the extension of the measure. The Chair explained that the idea was to create sufficient time during TCC14 to allow for the consideration of the CMS review report and the development of a CMS measure.  The Chair also acknowledged that the duplicative reporting requirements was a key issue to resolve and she asked that FFA provide a list and some suggestions around how this might be addressed to provide further clarity around the recommendation so that other CCMs can further consider this.
WCPFC14,473,"The Commission agreed that FFA members would provide some further detail on the duplicative reporting aspect and for CCMs that had comments on the list of obligations provided in DP06, to communicate their edits to Australia who would provide an update."
WCPFC14,474,Australia briefly introduced the document related to the list of obligations and in this respect it noted that WCPFC14-2017-DP06_rev1 attachment 1 had been circulated and provided a revised draft list of obligations to be reviewed by the CMS in 2018.  The revised list was adopted following further discussions that took place in the meeting margins.
WCPFC14,475,The Republic of the Marshall Islands introduced revised WCPFC14-2017-DP29 which provided some points in respect of addressing duplicative reporting and the rollover of CMM 2015-07 (WCPFC14-2017-DP29).  The recommendation relating to duplicative reporting and the rollover of CMM 2015-07 was adopted.
WCPFC14,476,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2017-07 Conservation and Management Measure for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (Attachment W), which will be effective for 2018 only.   81"
WCPFC14,477,"The Commission adopted a revised list of obligations to be assessed by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme in 2018 (Attachment V), which will replace the multi-year list of obligations that was adopted at WCPFC13."
WCPFC14,478,"The Commission noted that in submitting WCPFC14-2017-DP29, FFA member CCMs had provided an initial analysis and reiterated their view expressed during TCC13 that the essential scientific information already provided as operational level catch and effort data submissions earlier in the year must be recognised as meeting obligations to provide a number of required reporting obligations specified to be included in Annual Report Part 1.  It was also expressed that rather than have CCMs submit duplicative information there must be improvements made to facilitate access to data that is already made available to the Commission."
WCPFC14,479,"The Commission agreed to task the Secretariat, in consultation with SPC, to review the Commission’s reporting requirements to minimise duplicate reporting by CCMs, with a particular focus on streamlining the provision and accessibility of scientific data to the Commission, as well as to prioritise the enhancement of the Commission’s information management system in response to that review, and report back to WCPFC15."
WCPFC14,480,"The Commission encouraged CCMs to submit their Annual Report Part 1 in a timely manner, and note this is linked to TCC’s efforts to minimise verbal reports to the CMR process.   AGENDA ITEM 11 – ADOPTION OF THE 2018 IUU VESSEL LIST"
WCPFC14,481,"The Chair introduced WCPFC14-2017-26 WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2018, which presented for the consideration of WCPFC14 the relevant information for a decision on the 2018 WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC14,482,"Australia drew attention to three key TCC13 recommendations regarding the need for the Commission to seek cooperation and information from relevant CCMs, flag States, and other relevant bodies for additional information on IUU fishing activities in the Convention Area. Australia requested that the Executive Director write to the Regional Plan of Action to Promote Reasonable Fishing Practices (RPOA-IUU), and to Asian colleagues as reasonable port state countries that may have some additional information to share with the Commission regarding IUU activities in the WCPO."
WCPFC14,483,The Commission adopted the 2018 WCPFC IUU Vessel List (Attachment X).
WCPFC14,484,The Commission agreed to seek the cooperation of those CCMs or flag States to whom the vessel was flagged at the time the vessel was placed on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List and other CCMs’ cooperation to actively find out any information about these vessels and inform the Commission.
WCPFC14,485,"The Commission requested that CCMs provide prompt advice to the Commission by all CCMs if the vessels have been located or, if there are any known changes to name, flag or registered owner, including any action that the port States have taken such as denial of port entry and services to those vessels or any information from the cannery States of any landings made by these vessels."
WCPFC14,486,"The Commission tasked the Executive Director to write a letter to other RFMOs and relevant bodies conveying this same message for cooperation to locate these vessels.  The 82  Executive Director was asked to include in these letters the Regional Plan of Action for Responsible fishing, including IUU fishing.   AGENDA ITEM 12 – REPORT OF THE ELEVENTH ANNUAL SESSION OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE 12.1 Report of the Eleventh Finance and Administration Committee"
WCPFC14,487,"The Commission considered the report of FAC11 (WCPFC14-2017-FAC11). The FAC Co-Chair Wataru Tanoue (Japan) thanked those CCMs that participated in the FAC sessions on 2, 6, 7 December 2017. Main recommendations included: that the Secretariat is to draft a proposed amendment to the financial regulations providing for the establishment of a contingency reserve fund dedicated to planned maintenance of physical assets; a review of options to provide a supplementary retirement scheme for the Secretariat’s support staff; and the continuation of the Special Requirements Fund Intersessional Working Group to develop a Strategic Investment Plan. 12.2 Budget approval for 2018 and Indicative Budgets for 2019 and 2020"
WCPFC14,488,The Commission considered for adoption the Budget for 2018 and indicative budgets for 2019 and 2020 (WCPFC14-2017-FAC11).
WCPFC14,489,"The Commission adopted the report of the Eleventh Session of the FAC (WCPFC14-2017-FAC11), including the 2018 budget of $ 8,028,552 and indicative budgets for 2019 and 2020 of $ 8,215,645 and $ 8,061,369 respectively (Attachments Y and Z). AGENDA ITEM 13 – ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS 13.1 Strategic Plan"
WCPFC14,490,"The Executive Director introduced WCPFC14-2017-27 Strategic Plan that sought guidance from the Commission on how to further pursue the development of a Strategic Plan for the Commission and its Secretariat. WCPFC13 tasked the Secretariat with progressing the development of a Strategic Plan in 2017 with interested CCMs and to report back to WCPFC14. In response to the mixed reactions to the need for such a plan, the Executive Director undertook informal consultations with several CCMs during the intersessional period to identify a way forward. Feedback was mixed, with some CCMs considering that while the strategic plan was an important piece of work there were other far more important priorities for 2017 like the tropical tuna measure negotiations, developing a target reference for South Pacific albacore, and the Independent Review of the CMS. Others shared doubts as to the utility of a Strategic Plan with the Convention as the principal document for the Commission. So, the Secretariat decided it was not ideal to engage members in another intersessional process in 2017 and no further work was done on the Strategic Plan. The Secretariat sought clear guidance from the Commission on whether it requires a Strategic Plan and if it does the Commission should determine a process to develop such a plan that is more robust, CCMs led, inclusive and participatory."
WCPFC14,491,"The European Union noted that it was in favour of developing the process further and that it appreciated the efforts made in preparing the paper for this meeting. A strategic plan gave the organisation direction, which the European Union believed was essential for the good management of an organisation and the efficient allocation of resources, whether human or financial. It was also important to ensure the process was inclusive so that all members who wanted to contribute could do so.  83"
WCPFC14,492,"The United States thanked the Executive Director for his report, and like the European Union, saw value in a Strategic Plan as it could help the Commission function more effectively. Like SIDS, the United States also felt its concerns were not properly included during the development process. Being mindful of the work load of the organisation, and the relationship tensions stemming from the tropical tuna bridging measure negotiations, it did not support expending further resources on the further development of the plan at this stage and did not support further in person meetings, though this could be picked up again at a later time."
WCPFC14,493,"Japan agreed that the plan was not needed right now, as the Convention itself and the Workplan was already sufficient to guide the work of the WCPFC. The Commission should use its time right now to concentrate on the CMMs."
WCPFC14,494,"Palau, on behalf of PNA Members, supported the United States view that there should be a Strategic Plan. They also supported the development of a corporate plan. PNA members proposed the Secretariat be tasked with developing a medium term corporate plan with activities in the intersessional period and report back to WCPFC15."
WCPFC14,495,"Samoa supported the proposal from Palau on a medium term corporate plan that would clearly identify the Commissions core business. It also agreed with Japans views, that efforts should be concentrated on measures at this time."
WCPFC14,496,The Chair noted there was no wide support for the Commission to further develop a strategic plan. She confirmed with Members that they supported the Secretariat developing a medium term corporate plan to guide the work of the Commission.
WCPFC14,497,The Commission tasked the Secretariat to develop a medium-term corporate plan and report back to WCPFC15.  13.2 Research projects 13.2.1 Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction Project (Common Oceans) (ABNJ)
WCPFC14,498,The working paper WCPFC14-2017-29 Report to WCPFC on Progress of the Project Sustainable Management of Tuna Fisheries and Biodiversity Conservation in the ABNJ which provided an update on the ABNJ Common Oceans Tuna Project was taken as read.
WCPFC14,499,"Mr Kim Stobberup from FAO expressed FAO’s appreciation for the frequent mention of the contribution of the ABNJ project to the work of the Commission. He acknowledged the project partners in the region and international partners for their achievements. He mentioned Dr Shelley Clarke’s relocation to FAO Rome to continue her work with the Project and he reiterated the project’s commitment to complete the programmed activities and provide the Secretariat with whatever support is needed to do so, including the direct assistance from Dr Clarke. The ABNJ Tuna Project has recently been through a favourable mid-term evaluation, indicating significant achievements in many areas. This creates a good opportunity to consider the possibility of a second phase of the project under GEF sponsorship. Informal consultation with current partners has shown interest and support to participate in the process of developing the concept for such a second phase. The focus on ABNJ is demonstrated it remains one of the three key areas of interest under the International Waters Programme of GEF. Addressing fisheries and in particular IUU fishing in the high seas will continue to be a high priority under the next cycle of GEF funding. In the coming months the project will initiate a consultative process with all the tuna RFMOs to ensure that the Tuna Project continues to serve the needs of the tuna management world."
WCPFC14,500,"The European Union also thanked the FAO-ABNJ project and Dr Clarke. As the European Union funded WCPFC participation in this FAO-ABNJ tuna project, it was especially pleased to be 84  given reassurances that Dr Clarke would continue to assist the Commission supported by the project despite physically relocating to FAO offices in Rome."
WCPFC14,501,The Chair on behalf of the Commission thanked Dr Clarke for her continued hard work on this project and thanked the EU for its continued funding support to this project through this Commission
WCPFC14,502,The Commission noted the updates on the ABNJ project (WCPFC14-2017-29).  13.2.2 West Pacific East Asia (WPEA) Project
WCPFC14,503,"The working paper WCPFC14-2017-28 Update on WPEA Project, was taken as read given time constraints."
WCPFC14,504,"The Philippines thanked the Commission and the Secretariat for their support and assistance to this project. It also acknowledged the contribution by SPC-OFP. Through this project, the Philippines was able to build its capacity to participate more effectively in the work of the Commission. Their capacity was also built through participation in the three countries sub-regional workshop, SPC’s Tuna Data Workshop, and the Scientific Committee meeting; and its observer programme and port sampling activities have been improved."
WCPFC14,505,"Indonesia thanked the Secretariat, the Commission and other bodies that supported the WPEA project. The project had enabled Indonesia to undertake port sampling programmes and they now have eight years of time series data from this project to contribute to various meetings and helped with the stock status work of this Commission. Indonesia now had a better understanding of the importance of managing their archipelagic waters and these project data helped them to develop their first harvest strategy for tuna in their waters, through strong collaboration with NGOs, industry and fisheries associations, and the Indonesian Government. Indonesia encouraged CCMs to read paper WCPFC14-2017-DP26 Information Paper on Interim Harvest Strategies for Tropical Tuna in archipelagic waters of Indonesia, as it was the first information it had provided to the Commission and it intended to bring this information in further detail to the next SC meeting. Indonesia deeply appreciated the support of the project and looked forward to further strengthening its collaborations to develop responsible use of tuna resources not only in its waters but also in the WCPO."
WCPFC14,506,The Commission noted the updates on the WPEA project (WCPFC14-2017-28).  13.3 Election of officers
WCPFC14,507,The Commission made a number of appointments to Commission positions commencing in 2018: a. Mr Ueta Jr. Fasiili (Samoa) was appointed as SC Chair; b. Mr Laurence Edwards (RMI) was appointed as TCC Vice-Chair;  c. Mr Wataru Tanoue (Japan) was appointed the new FAC Co-Chair on the first day of WCPFC14 to ensure the continuation of the co-chairing arrangement and the efficient progression of FAC work in the margins of the meeting; and  d. Mr Bradley Philips (FSM) was appointed as FAD Management Options IWG Chair.  85
WCPFC14,508,"In support of other 2018 Intersessional Working Group activities, to be progressed electronically, the Commission confirmed the following:  a. Mr Shingo Ota (Japan) would lead the IWG-Sharks; b. Mr Glen Joseph (RMI) would lead the Review of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme IWG (CMS IWG); c. Mr Tom Graham (USA) would lead the TCC-observer report and observer conduct IWG; and d. Ms Sarah Williams (New Zealand) would lead the south Pacific Albacore Roadmap virtual IWG. 13.4 Future meetings"
WCPFC14,509,"In 2018, the Commission agreed that:  ER and EMWG would be held from Monday 6th to Tuesday 7th August 2018 Busan, Korea SC14 would be held from Wednesday 8th to Thursday 16th August 2018 in Busan, Korea;  NC14 would likely be held in the first week of September in Japan, with the exact dates and venue to be confirmed; TCC14 would be held from Wednesday 26th September to Tuesday 2nd October 2018 in Majuro, Republic of Marshall Islands; FAD Management Options IWG would be held Wednesday 3rd October 2018 in Majuro, Republic of Marshall Islands; WCPFC15 would be held from Monday 3rd to Friday 7th December in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia; and FAC12 would be held immediately prior to WCPFC15."
WCPFC14,510,"The Commission agreed that $28,000 is to be transferred out of working capital fund to cover the additional costs of the 2018 agreed future meetings. AGENDA ITEM 14 – OTHER MATTERS"
WCPFC14,511,No other matters were raised for consideration at WCPFC14.  AGENDA ITEM 15 – SUMMARY REPORT OF THE WCPFC14
WCPFC14,512,The Chair outlined the process for adoption of the Summary Report for WCPFC14. The practice had been for an Outcomes Document containing agreed decision points to be circulated to the Commission within seven working days following the close of the annual session with the draft 86  Summary Report to be provided as soon as possible. CCMs would be given thirty working days after circulation of the draft Summary Report to provide any changes. The complete Summary Report would be finalised intersessionally and posted on the Commission website and representatives would be advised accordingly.  AGENDA ITEM 16 – CLOSE OF THE MEETING
WCPFC14,513,"The Chair thanked all participants and the Secretariat for their very hard work and engagement, not only at WCPFC14 but over the last year and a half to ensure the successful adoption of the bridging measure for tropical tunas.  Noting that the bridging measure was not the only outcome from this meeting, the Chair expressed that in her view the Commission had positioned itself to continue its good work into next year, and she expressed her congratulations to participants on the outcomes of their efforts and encouraged participants to look back on the meeting feeling satisfied with their hard work.  The Chair specifically thanked the meeting participants who were still present at the closing, and acknowledged that their presence and continued engagement at this late hour was a demonstration of their commitment to the Commission and its principles and objectives.  Finally, she wished the participants well in their travels back home, and confirmed that she looked forward to welcoming delegates to her home Pohnpei next year for WCPFC15."
WCPFC14,514,"The meeting closed at 3.07am on Friday, 8 December 2017."
WCPFC15,1,"The Fifteenth Regular Session of the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC15) took place from 10—14 December 2018 in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA."
WCPFC15,2,"The following Members and Participating Territories attended WCPFC15: American Samoa, Australia, Canada, the China, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), the Cook Islands, the European Union (EU), the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Fiji, France, French Polynesia, Guam, Indonesia, Japan, Kiribati, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea (PNG), the Philippines, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Chinese Taipei, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, the United States of America (USA) Vanuatu, and Wallis and Futuna."

WCPFC15,7,A full list of all participants is provided in Attachment A.
WCPFC15,8,"The 15th regular session of the WCPFC was preceded with a Hawaiian Oli at 9:15am on Monday, 10 December 2018."
WCPFC15,9,"Following the traditional Hawaiian presentation, Reverend Kaleo Patterson offered a Pule (prayer and ceremony of cleansing)."
WCPFC15,10,"The WCPFC Executive Director, Feleti P Teo, OBE welcomed delegates to Honolulu. He observed that technically there was no official host government for WCPFC15 after the decision to relocate the meeting from Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), but thanked the United States for its financial contribution and logistical support, and the Western Pacific Fisheries Management Council (WPFMC) for its help in securing the meeting venue at short notice, and for the help with organizational arrangements. He expressed appreciation to the United States’ tuna industry for hosting the welcoming ceremony. The Executive Director noted that the meeting facility has a special place in the history of the Commission, as it is where the WCPFC Convention was adopted and opened for signature in September 2000. He highlighted the following three issues: the importance of the science–management dialogue in expediting the implementation of the harvest strategy workplan; review of the compliance monitoring scheme (CMS) and the need to agree on a measure that will allow the CMS to continue beyond 2018; and the need to adopt a corporate planning document for the Commission.  He closed by wishing delegates success in their deliberations. The full statement of the Executive Director is in Attachment B."
WCPFC15,11,"The Commission Chair, Ms Rhea Moss-Christian, offered opening remarks in which she referenced the negotiations to establish the Commission. She noted that a number of individuals who were present when the Commission was established were again present at WCPFC15. The WCPFC was the first agreement established following adoption in 1995 of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement (FSA), and incorporates a number of key provisions of that Agreement, including the principle of compatibility, the need to take into consideration the special requirements of developing States, participation by territories, and adoption of the precautionary approach. She reviewed how the Commission has grown, as evidenced by its budget and the size of its reports.  She noted that conservation and management measures (CMMs) are in place for the key tuna species, and for a number of non-target, dependent and associated species, and that elements of a harvest strategy management approach are being developed and adopted. She noted that scientific knowledge forms the basis for the cornerstone of WCPFC management decisions, and that while national aspirations drive individual countries positions, a greater responsibility should be borne in mind, in light of the shared ancestry of the members of the Commission. She referenced two recent bold fisheries challenges put forth by Pacific Island leaders: the President of Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) challenged the region to eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing by 2023, and the President of Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) issued a challenge to achieve full transparency in tuna fisheries by 2023. She observed that it was not a coincidence that these two bold challenges came from two of the most vulnerable island nations, whose economies and futures are directly tied to the health of the tuna resources. She stated that WCPFC has the lead responsibility in meeting these challenges issued by the leaders of two of its  3    members, and that putting a timeframe to these tasks ensures that members stay focused and continue making ongoing progress. She acknowledged the hard work of the Executive Director and the Secretariat staff, and expressed gratitude to the United States and WPFMC for their arrangements and hospitality. She also noted that the Hawaiian Oli and the blessings received in the Pule served as significant reminders of the Commission’s origins. The Chair then officially opened the 15th regular session of the WCPFC. The full statement of the Commission Chair is in Attachment C.   1.1 Adoption of Agenda"
WCPFC15,12,The Agenda was adopted (Attachment D).  1.2 Statements from Members and Participating Territories
WCPFC15,13,"The United States welcomed delegates to Hawaii on behalf of the government of the United States and its Participating Territories, noting that representatives present included the Governor of CNMI. On behalf of all members, cooperating non-members and participating territories (CCMs) it thanked the Secretariat staff, local staff of United States agencies, and WPFMC, as well as industry stakeholders (Hawaii Longline Association, American Tunaboat Association, TriMarine, South Pacific Tuna Corp, and United Fishing Agency) who hosted the welcoming function."
WCPFC15,14,"The Hon. Dennis Momotaro, Minister of Natural Resources and Commerce, and Chairman of the Marshall Islands Marine Resources Authority Board (RMI), noted that he was attending his first annual meeting of the WCPFC, and was eager to see why essential issues at WCPFC meetings are not being resolved. He stated that SIDS are most affected by the issues under discussion and his delegation was ready to engage constructively. He hoped CCMs could come to agreement on a number of critical issues: the need to review transhipments, the CMS process, and participation by small islands developing states (SIDS) and territories. He noted the challenge made by RMI for an IUU-free Pacific by 2023, and the challenge from FSM to institute all electronic monitoring (EM) of fisheries by 2023. He looked forward to meaningful outcomes from WCPFC"
WCPFC15,15,"15. The Hon. Ralph D Torres, Governor of CNMI, stated that in October CNMI was hit by a Category 5 super typhoon that devastated Saipan and Tinian, but emphasized their resolve to rebuild. He thanked the State of Hawaii, federal agencies and the governments from neighbouring islands who provided aid. He stated that such devastation highlights the importance of food security and access to fisheries, and stated that CNMI shares many issues with other small islands, but lacks the capability to institute large-scale  fisheries. He expressed interest in exploring how the Commission can help CNMI access benefits from fisheries. He noted the commitment to combatting IUU fishing in Micronesia, which will require assistance from governments and NGOs. He also noted the need for assistance in monitoring fisheries resources and acknowledged the importance of the issues before the Commission."
WCPFC15,16,"France stated that, regarding the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area, France had drafted a letter of intent to WCPFC and IATTC to indicate its choice to favour WCPFC regulations during the next three years. This choice was motivated by a strong concern for clarification of the conservation and management regime applicable to French Polynesia’s vessels in the waters of this shared management zone. He stated that this legal clarification is not intended to call into question France’s participation in respect of its commitments to the IATTC. France continued to strongly support the harmonization of control and management rules between the two organizations, stating that it intended to maintain its high standards of control at sea and dockside monitoring. He also called for harmonization of high seas boarding and inspection measures between WCPFC and IATTC to enable more effective action against IUU fishing operations in the area, which faces permanent fishing pressure. France also expressed concern about  4    management of the Eastern High Seas Pocket (EHSP), ambiguities about its geographical configuration, and the lack of joint data available to neighbouring states and territories. France noted the need for better monitoring of fishing activity in the EHSP, such as through direct transmission of VMS data to Cook Islands, Kiribati and French Polynesia. He also addressed the need for management of drifting fish aggregation devices (FADs) and stated that there were many incursions into New Caledonia’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in violation of its laws. He noted most of these situations could be easily resolved by a single VHF contact in accordance with IMO resolution A 703, but that many vessels appeared not to monitor VHF channel 16."
WCPFC15,17,"The Hon. Tetabo Nakara, Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources of Kiribati, stated that the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) connects all members and necessitates their cooperation. He encouraged CCMs to push for adoption of a precautionary approach to fisheries management and noted the need for improved science-based decision making. He congratulated the WCPFC for adopting several critical CMMs and FAD-related measures that have contributed to improvements in the status of tuna stocks, while noting the need to establish harvest control rules, with target reference points (TRPs). He noted that all members can understand why this is difficult and encouraged continued dialogue in search of new and innovative solutions to ensure tuna resources are sustainably managed. He acknowledged that all CCMs have specific interests, while thanking all members for helping take into account the needs of SIDS. He referenced Article 10.3(i) of the Convention, and their experience with the CMS, stating that the new proposed measure by FFA members is based on principles of fairness and efficiency, and hoped it would be adopted by members."
WCPFC15,18,"The Hon. Marion Henry, Secretary of Resources and Development of FSM noted the many challenges in monitoring fishing in the region, and noted RMI’s declaration on IUU fishing, stating that all CCMs should be committed to 100% monitoring coverage to eliminate IUU fishing. He stated that FSM has committed to 100% monitoring of fishing in FSM’s EEZ by 2023 and was committed to full transparency through a combination of observer coverage and e-monitoring, which would provide much needed data on fisheries, and provide markets with assurance that catch is legal and sustainable with no slave labour involved. He expressed his hope that this will set the stage for global effort in this regard. He observed that the Commission can enhance sustainability, and reduce bycatch, and hoped that through this effort they can ensure the monitoring of over 50% of the tuna catch. He stated that FFA and PNA members are supportive of this effort. He stated that that they had a $2.3 million funding goal, and that The Nature Conservancy has contributed 10% of this goal. He asked for support from all stakeholders to find the technical and financial resources to put e-monitoring in place throughout the convention area. He also noted FSM’s desire to host an annual meeting of WCPFC, stating the importance of making decisions in places where people are most affected."
WCPFC15,19,"The Hon. Lopao’o Natanielu Mu’a, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries of Samoa acknowledged the work of the Commission and its decisions that greatly impact SIDS, including Samoa. He stated that on resource-constrained islands, living and non-living marine resources are essential resources, and tuna and other highly migratory species are critically important in providing food security, livelihoods and economic prosperity for Samoa. He noted key areas vital to Samoa and other SIDS. South Pacific Albacore tuna is the target species for Samoa’s domestic longline fishery, and a primary source of foreign revenue, food security and livelihoods. Failure to set a TRP for South Pacific albacore would further delay implementation of desired management interventions and prolong economic hardship and reduction in catches in Samoa’s fishery. He noted the subsidy support received by some foreign fleets and stated that an appropriate management strategy should be in place to ensure domestic and unsubsidized fleets remain economically viable. He asked CCMs, and particularly those interested in South Pacific albacore, to urgently develop an agreed, robust management arrangement for this species, including progressing with an agreement on various elements of a harvest strategy to reverse declining biomass trends and restore profitability. He noted Samoa is disadvantaged because its EEZ is zone- 5    locked by the EEZs of other Pacific Island states, which limits its ability to realise its fishing interests and development aspirations, especially opportunities for profitable domestic fleet operations, and also impacts its small artisanal fishery.  He stated Samoa is considering exploring development opportunities in the closest high seas areas and asked other members to consider supporting its efforts.  He opposed any revision to the tropical tuna CMM that would limit the opportunity of SIDS to participate in high seas fishing until a high seas limit and a fair process for allocating that limit has been agreed to. He noted the combined challenges of collapsing fisheries resulting from increasing fishing effort (including IUU), environmental impacts, and climate change and stated that these challenges threaten the integrity of the oceans and marine ecosystems, and potentially the survival of Pacific Islanders.  In that regard, he stated that members should be mindful that the burden of actions to protect the oceans and manage its fisheries resources should not disproportionately fall on SIDS."
WCPFC15,20,"The Hon. Semisi Tauelangi Fakahau, Minister for Agriculture and Food, Forestry, and Fisheries, of the Kingdom of Tonga, encouraged all participants to emphasise the importance of ensuring the sustainable management of tuna resources in the WCPO. He noted Tonga’s most important commercial fishery targets bigeye, yellowfin, albacore and other tuna-like species, with albacore tuna dominating the catch composition for many years. He stated Tonga’s wish that it would remain sustainable but noted a recent drop in catch rates in its national waters had hampered the fishing industry, affecting exports and the amount of fish available for local consumption. He stated that to maintain the long-term sustainability and economic viability of the tuna fisheries in the WCPO and secure livelihoods for local fishermen, it is important that stronger and more effective fisheries management arrangements for migratory tuna stocks and other species are agreed at WCPFC15. He highlighted the following priorities: (i) establishing a TRP for South Pacific albacore, and establishing management measures for the high seas fisheries; (ii) developing a new CMS that produces fair outcomes for CCMs and promotes and improved compliance, while recognizing the special requirements of SIDS, including by streamlining processes, strengthening capacity and requiring a widely consulted and well informed CMM 2013-06 SIDS impact assessment before a measure is adopted and used in the CMS; and (iii) renewal of the tropical tuna bridging measures, while retaining the additional high seas FAD closure, bigeye longline catch limits, and current purse seine effort limits on the high seas."
WCPFC15,21,"The Hon. Dr Puakena Boreham, Minister for Natural Resources of Tuvalu stated that Tuvalu believes science-based management is essential if the Commission is to secure the sustainability of WCPFC fisheries, and looked to WCPFC15 to implement the SC recommendations that there should be no increase in fishing mortality of bigeye tuna; and that the fishing pressure in the albacore longline fishery should be reduced to improve its economic viability. She stated that the review of the tropical tuna measure should not allow any relaxation of the controls agreed for this fishery by WCPFC14, and that deliberations on a TRP for albacore must reflect the need to ensure that this fishery can maintain profitability. She also stated that the surface fishery in Tuvalu’s waters is very dependent on FADs. She stated that Tuvalu is happy to support proposals to make FADs more environmentally friendly so as to prevent entanglement of marine creatures, and to move towards bio-degradable FADs that do not add to the plastic pollution of the ocean, but that Tuvalu did not want to see changes in the definition of what constitutes a FAD (noting that fish associate with floating objects whether or not they have been deployed by a fishing boat) and do not want to see the limit on the number of FADs deployed by each vessel reduced. She stated Tuvalu was working with their partners in the PNA on other ways of improving FAD management. She also noted that Tuvaluan crew are working on a number of fishing vessels and Tuvalu has long aspired to see more of its people employed on vessels, but that Tuvalu is very concerned at the poor working conditions and low wages paid to crew in some fishing fleets. She stated that if continued this will bring the fishery of the region into disrepute and urged CCMs to support the FFA proposal on working conditions for crew, which despite being non-binding, was an important step.  6"
WCPFC15,22,"PNG emphasised the importance of fisheries for SIDS and stated that the Commission must encourage adoption of measures that are fair and consistent, and do not place disproportionate burdens on SIDS. He noted the need to take precautionary measures to avoid a decline in stocks, and the need to promote sustainable fisheries that avoid any one member being worse off. He reaffirmed PNG’s sovereignty over its domestic waters, stating its wish to ensure measures apply to the high seas and EEZs, and not to waters landward of the EEZ. He noted that PNG was looking forward to hosting WCPFC16 in 2019."
WCPFC15,23,"The Philippines observed it faces many challenges, and stated its compliance with CMMs is a work in progress, but that with an enhanced policy framework in place, ongoing structural reforms, and significant investments in infrastructure for enhanced fisheries management, it is confident that with the support of the Commission and the continuing cooperation with other CCMs their compliance will continue to improve. He noted that the Philippines’s access in high seas pocket No. 1 is limited to 36 traditional catcher vessels. Catches in this area have a significant contribution to the Philippine economy and the food security of more than 102 million Filipinos. He stated that the Philippines intend to sustain the same CMM for the fleet in high seas pocket No. 1 and observed that the same FAD management as is currently in place. Philippine fishing operations in this area have 100% regional observer program (ROP) coverage as well as vessel monitoring system (VMS) coverage, including catch documentation and reporting to the Commission.  The Philippines looked forward to collaborating with other CCMs to achieve the priority goals and objectives of the Commission at WCPFC15."
WCPFC15,24,"French Polynesia stated that, as indicated by France, it has made the choice to apply the rules of the WCPFC in its EEZ and the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area for its fleet, as recommended by the “WCPFC9 decision on the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area”, paragraph (a) (iii). French Polynesia has a long history of cooperation in the WCPO as member of the Pacific Community, permanent observer of FFA, and Participating Territory of the WCPFC. French Polynesia expressed its gratitude to France for its support through this process. In choosing to apply the WCPFC CMMs to its activities, it hoped the Commission will make the best decisions to manage the tuna resources and consider the needs of the SIDS and Territories as set out in article 30 of the convention. He noted that French Polynesia has adopted a roadmap for the development of its fishing industry in compliance with the capacity building of the country and the potential of the tuna resources in its EEZ. To strengthen the development of the fishing industry, French Polynesia was certified by the Marine Stewardship Council for its albacore and yellowfin longline fisheries. To maintain this certification status, the tuna resources must be managed effectively on a long-term basis. To this end, French Polynesia expressed confidence that all the parties would reach consensus on the harvest strategies and the relevant harvest control rules and reference points for albacore, yellowfin and bigeye. French Polynesia also expressed concern about conservation of bycatch species, noting that the whole EEZ of French Polynesia is a sanctuary for marine mammals, turtles and sharks; some species of birds, including seabirds, are also protected. French Polynesia stated it is eager to adopt measures to protect those species provided the rules do not constitute a disproportionate burden for fishery development. French Polynesia also welcomed proposals to effectively regulate the use of FADs."
WCPFC15,25,"Fiji stated that its priorities included South Pacific albacore TRPs, a harvest strategy for tropical tuna, and the CMS. It looked forward to the discussions and said it would provide additional statements outlining their specific interests during the course of the meeting."
WCPFC15,26,"Australia stated it was a strong supporter of the WCPFC and that the Commission’s success is built on the hard work, cooperation and continued goodwill of its members. Australia stated its commitment to making progress on the tropical tuna measure, which is a foundation of WCPFC’s success and noted the responsibility to ensure that there are strong controls in place to manage these stocks that are critical to all members, and in particular SIDS. Australia anticipated an energetic discussion on the CMS, noting the need to focus on the commitment to improving compliance and implementation, and continuing to  7    demonstrate the effectiveness of this Commission.  Australia also expressed confidence that the Commission is on the right path towards harvest strategies  but that a better pathway was needed for scientists and manager to talk, and voiced strong support for the SC advice to establish a science-management dialogue."
WCPFC15,27,"The Cook Islands (speaking also as Chair of the Forum Fisheries Committee, and on behalf of FFA members) recognised the Chair’s leadership in advancing the Commission’s work and looked forward to her continued leadership.  She highlighted the following priorities of FFA members in WCPFC15:  maintaining the strength of the well-balanced tropical tuna measure; adoption of a meaningful TRP for South Pacific albacore; adoption of a new CMS CMM;  ensuring effective participation of SIDS in the decision-making and work of the Commission, which is a key requirement to ensure that the Commission can fulfil its objectives; preventing cruel and unfair treatment of crew on board fishing vessels through passage of a resolution to encourage all CCMs to establish basic minimum labour standards, as a stepping stone to a future CMM;  review of the transhipment measure in 2019 to effectively regulate transhipment activities; and enactment of flexible arrangements to enable a periodic reduction in delegation sizes and thereby facilitate the hosting of Commission meetings by SIDS."
WCPFC15,28,"The Hon. Dalton Tagelagi, Minister for Natural Resources of Niue stated Niue’s commitment to ensuring its sovereign rights and aspirations are protected. He stated that although Niue may be the smallest member, it is well aware of its responsibility to ensure resource use is sustainable. Niue looked forward to decisions on three key issues: (i) a TRP for South Pacific albacore; (ii) effective participation by SIDS at Commission meetings; and (iii) establishment of a high seas allocation for the purse seine fishery by 2019, and for the longline fishery by 2020. He noted the need for cooperation to ensure WCPO tuna resources are managed sustainably and reaffirmed Niue’s commitment to participating in and contributing to the work of the WCPFC. He noted that by working cooperatively the region could strengthen its fisheries management and contribute to the sustainability of resources for future generations. 1.3 Meeting Arrangements"
WCPFC15,29,"The Commission reviewed the meeting arrangements and indicative meeting schedule, and confirmed decisions made at the Heads of Delegation meeting, held on Sunday, 9 December.  1.3.1 Establishment of small working groups (CNMs, CMR, others)"
WCPFC15,30,"The Commission considered the need for the establishment of small working groups (SWGs) to progress work on specific issues. Ten SWGs were established to consider the following issues: (i) finalization of the provisional Compliance Monitoring Report (pCMR), led by the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC) Chair; (ii) the draft CMM on CMS under development intersessionally, led by the CMS intersessional working group (IWG) Chair; (iii) the tropical tuna CMM (led by the Commission Chair); (iv) south Pacific albacore TRP (led by Fiji); (v) requests for cooperating non-member (CNM) status (led by Australia); (vi) the TCC workplan (led by the TCC Vice-Chair); (vii) labour standards for crew (led by Vanuatu); (viii) the comprehensive CMM on sharks and rays (led by the Chair of IWG-Sharks); (ix) seabirds (led by New Zealand); and (x) terms of reference for a science–management dialogue (led by the Commission Vice-Chair and Australia)."
WCPFC15,31,"Canada highlighted the range of SWGs that were established and observed the need over the longer term to establish a workplan for the Commission to help focus, organize and prioritize its work. He noted the alignment between this suggestion and the concerns of SIDS with respect to ensuring the ability of members to effectively participate in the work of the Commission.   8     1.3.2 Hosting arrangements for WCPFC annual sessions hosted by SIDS"
WCPFC15,32,The Chair opened the discussion on hosting arrangements for WCPFC annual sessions hosted by SIDS by noting that she and the Executive Director considered this to be a priority issue for discussion in light of the decision to change the venue for WCPFC15.
WCPFC15,33,"Vanuatu, on behalf of FFA members, introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP15: Considerations for SIDS to host WCPFC Commission Meetings, which requests special consideration from the Commission and seeks flexibility, from time to time, to provide the opportunity for smaller island CCMs to host Commission meetings. They noted that the Commission had not adopted guidelines for hosting requirements, and that FFA members would continue to reject such suggestions, as this would effectively prevent some SIDS from hosting Commission meetings. They stated that the ability to host a Commission meeting in the countries that drove the establishment of this Commission is important, and that it is essential that Pacific peoples are provided the benefits derived from hosting delegations. More importantly, it provides an opportunity for those in the national fisheries administrations and domestic industries of SIDS to engage in and learn about the processes and work of the Commission. As such, they requested that CCMs accept that, from time to time, delegations will need to reduce the number of delegates they send to Commission meetings. To do this, they suggested that when a SIDS puts forward an offer to host a Commission meeting and meeting size will need to be restricted, that information on meeting capacity, infrastructure and logistics be provided to the Commission to inform their decision on what kind of actions and considerations each delegation would need to make to reduce their delegation size."
WCPFC15,34,"The Chair noted WCPFC15-2018-OP03: Alternative options to enable SIDS to host WCPFC meetings, submitted by Pew, WWF, Birdlife, EDF, IELP, ANCORS and IPNLF, and thanked the observers for providing the paper."
WCPFC15,35,"The United States thanked the FFA and observers for their papers. It acknowledged the desire of SIDS to host meetings and stated it would be happy to explore issues relating to this topic. The United States supported the suggestion that any logistical constraints be made known in advance, which would allow the Commission to make rational decisions on hosting and enable delegations to make appropriate decisions. The United States stated it would hesitate to have firm limits on delegation sizes, and limits on observers, but would be happy to work cooperatively with other CCMs in the future as needed."
WCPFC15,36,"Japan acknowledged the large size of its delegation of 77 people at WCPFC15 and explained this resulted from Japan’s different fisheries (coastal, offshore and long distance) that target various species with different gear types. The large delegation is needed to enable Japan to adequately represent these differing interests and make rapid decisions during meetings. Japan stated that it was sympathetic with SIDS’ concerns, but supported the approach taken by the United States in not wishing to make firm commitments at WCPFC15, especially with respect to firm limits on delegation size. Japan noted very strict limits (such as a restriction to 10 people per delegation) would not be acceptable to Japan but welcomed future discussions. Japan suggested provision of specific information by prospective host countries (such as the number of hotel rooms, distance from hotel to meeting facility, and number of rental cars and flights) would be very helpful. It noted that it would make its best effort to reduce the size of its delegation if necessitated by limited host country capacity."
WCPFC15,37,"FSM stated that it was hard for it to withdraw from hosting WCPFC15 as originally planned but understood that large delegations have interests in ensuring their participation. FSM thanked all CCMs and observers who were cooperating in trying to find solutions. They noted the realities of insufficient car rentals, hotel rooms, and other facilities, but stated that decisions made in the meetings affect SIDS.  9    It noted that FFA had submitted WCPFC15-2018-DP27: Proposal to Amend the Rules of Procedures – Rule 36 as a proposed amendment to rules of procedure, which would apply to all observers, and have the effect of removing the accreditation of any organization that does not participate for at least 3 years in one of the regular meetings of the Commission or its subsidiary bodies."
WCPFC15,38,"Chinese Taipei recognized the aspirations of SIDS to host meetings but stated that it was not in favour of limits on delegation size, and preferred that each delegation should determine its own size. It thanked the NGOs for submitting WCPFC15-2018-OP03, and expressed support for idea of co-hosting arrangements."
WCPFC15,39,"Korea thanked FFA and the observers for submitting papers. Korea stated that it fully understands the concerns raised by SIDS, and would need to reflect on limits to the number of delegates. It observed that some countries may need larger delegations than others, either because of language difficulties or interests at stake. It stated that it would be helpful to have suggestions from SIDS regarding delegation sizes, and looked forward to further discussion on the proposed amendment of the suggested change to the Commission’s Rules of Procedure as submitted in WCPFC15-2018-DP27."
WCPFC15,40,"The EU stated it understood the concerns as expressed by SIDS and FFA members, noting that this was an important issue. The EU fully supported the need for large delegations to make efforts to reduce their size, and suggested hosting by SIDS was in particular an option for meetings of subsidiary bodies of the Commission. It encouraged flexibility by all CCMs."
WCPFC15,41,"RMI expressed support for the views expressed by other FFA members. It noted that prior to the offer from FSM to host WCPFC15, which did not eventuate, Nauru had proposed hosting a Commission meeting, which also did not take place. RMI stated they would like to ensure that similar situations do not occur again in the future. It indicated that RMI would like to host the Commission meeting, and if it did propose to host, it would present all information required, and asked that all CCMs be flexible to enable RMI to host the Commission in the future."
WCPFC15,42,"PNG fully supported the FFA proposal, which it observed contained flexibility to allow SIDS that could host large numbers to do so, and those that cannot to be upfront about what is possible. It welcomed further discussion, and noted that PNG has a large delegation, and uses the opportunity to progress work of national interest through bilateral and other meetings."
WCPFC15,43,"Nauru presented draft language as contained in WCPFC15-2018-DP30: FFA Members proposed Recommendation under Agenda item 1.3.2. Following further consultations with members, FFA members proposed a revised recommendation addressing hosting of WCPFC meetings by SIDS."
WCPFC15,44,"The Commission agreed that when a SIDS or participating territory makes an offer to host a WCPFC meeting which may need meeting size adjustment, that the offer include information on the available meeting capacity, logistics and infrastructure. The Commission will take this information into account when considering offers to host WCPFC meetings and, where needed, CCMs will endeavour to accommodate such constraints, including by reviewing delegation sizes.   AGENDA ITEM 2   — ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR"
WCPFC15,45,"The Executive Director introduced WCPFC15-2018-04: 2018 Annual Report of the Executive Director, which is a requirement under Rule 13 of the Commission’s Rules of Procedure. He noted that the absence of a strategic plan for the Commission makes reporting on accomplishment of strategic  10    priorities of the Commission difficult. Consequently, the annual report is structured as a historical account of key developments, achievements and challenges of the Commission and its Secretariat as they pertain to the implementation of decisions and agreements of the Commission. The Secretariat’s work programme is largely based on the decisions of the Commission and in accordance with the provisions of the WCPFC Convention. WCPFC14 effectively set the work programme for the Secretariat during 2018, with the main highlight being the adoption of CMM 2017-01. Specific tasks were sanctioned by WCPFC14 to be progressed intersessionally through the IWG meetings on electronic reporting and electronic monitoring (ER and EM) and FAD management options. Other intersessional work were agreed to be progressed through virtual working groups to consider a comprehensive approach for: sharks and rays management (IWG-Sharks); South Pacific albacore management (SPA-VIWG); the continuing review of the CMS and development of a new measure (CMS IWG); the development of a strategic investment plan for the special requirement fund; and access to observer reports and conduct of observers. These were in addition to the routine work in support of the annual meetings of the four subsidiary bodies of the Commission. Key highlights of achievements for 2018 include: timely submission of the report of the Independent Review Panel that reviewed the CMS; successful meetings of the Scientific Committee (SC), Northern Committee (NC) and TCC meetings; timely completion and delivery of the draft CMR; an updated stock assessment for bigeye tuna and stock assessments for South Pacific albacore, Pacific bluefin tuna, North Pacific swordfish, North Pacific shortfin mako shark, silky shark and whale shark; successful convening of the third meetings of IWGs on ER and EM, and FAD options; progress on the work of the IWG-Sharks to develop a comprehensive sharks and rays CMM; and good progress on the work of the CMS IWG, and implementation of the Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction Program (Common Oceans) (ABNJ) and Western Pacific East Asia (WPEA) projects. The Executive Director noted that staff numbers had been relatively stable, and financial affairs were in good order, with an unqualified audit report. He noted the voluntary trust fund contributions (itemized on pp. 8–9 of his report) and thanked the donors. He also noted the contributions made by SPC for scientific services; FFA for VMS services; and the ISC for scientific services for the NC. He acknowledged the presence of the director of IATTC, which is an important relationship because of the shared border and management area with the WCPFC. He also noted relationships with other Pacific regional organizations."
WCPFC15,46,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the Executive Director and his senior officers for an excellent report. Tonga thanked the Executive Director for placing considerable emphasis on the issue of climate change when he reported in September to the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders in Nauru.  It stated that, as clearly articulated by Tokelau in the FAC meeting on 9 December, climate change is the greatest challenge facing all members, and particularly WCPFC’s SIDS members, both with respect to the future of their fisheries and their long-term survival. Tonga asked that all Commission members bear this in mind as the meeting progresses, stating that for many FFA member countries, the impacts of climate change are all too real, and it is essential that the Commission does everything it can, both to reduce its carbon footprint and to factor climate change impacts into the ongoing and future management of the key tuna stocks that are so critical to the future wellbeing of FFA members. Tonga stated that it looked forward to working together with members and the Secretariat to strengthen this aspect of WCPFC’s work in the years ahead and thanked the Executive Director and the Secretariat staff for their hard work throughout the past year."
WCPFC15,47,"The EU encouraged active involvement by WCPFC in the Kobe Process among tuna regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs), suggesting there is much to learn, share experiences and knowledge and discuss with other RFMOs, both at a broad, global level and on an issue-specific basis, including on FADs, where recent progress was made by other RFMOs. The EU inquired regarding a joint workshop with IATTC on bigeye tuna growth, and regarding funding for inclusion of the FLUX standard in WCPFC electronic reporting standards that was earmarked in the 2018 budget. In reply, the Chair noted the Kobe process would be addressed under Agenda Item 13. SPC indicated that IATTC  11    had invited SPC and other scientists to address bigeye growth at a workshop in January 2019 and that SPC and some CCMs would be taking part. The Secretariat stated that it would provide updates on funding for ER and EM during the meeting, and confirmed that Phase 2 of E-reporting for high seas transhipment reporting to accept data in XML conforming to FLUX standards would be scheduled in 2019 subject to availability of budgetary funds (refer pp. 19 of the report) . The EU asked to be kept informed about the IATTC meeting."
WCPFC15,48,The Commission accepted the 2018 Annual Report of the Executive Director (WCPFC15-2018-04).   AGENDA ITEM 3  —  MEMBERSHIP AND OTHER APPLICATIONS 3.1 Status of the Convention
WCPFC15,49,"New Zealand, as depositary of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, presented WCPFC15-2018-05: Status of the Convention. It advised that since its last report in December 2017, New Zealand had not received notification of any instruments of ratification or accession to the Convention."
WCPFC15,50,The Commission noted the report on the Status of the WCPFC Convention (WCPFC15-2018-05).  3.2 Update on Observer Status
WCPFC15,51,The Executive Director referred the meeting to WCPFC15-2018-06: List of Observers that provided the full list of observer delegations. A statement from the North Pacific Fisheries Commission was provided to WCPFC15 (WCPF15-2018-OP20).
WCPFC15,52,"FSM, on behalf of FFA members, noted that they recognise Article 21 of the Convention, which promotes transparency in the decision making of the Commission. It also noted the various calls made by observers regarding participation in certain areas of the Commission’s work. However, as they have noted previously, they believe that the current process for observer status and participation requires strengthening. Under Agenda Item 1.3.2, FFA members (in WCPFC15-2018-DP27) suggested an improvement to the management of observer participation at Commission and subsidiary bodies’ meetings. They also noted their ongoing concern regarding yearly increases in the number of participants, which is making it increasingly difficult for many FFA members to host Commission-related meetings. Considering this issue, FFA members have also suggested the Commission allow for flexible arrangements to enable FFA members to host WCPFC meetings."
WCPFC15,53,"Kiribati, on behalf of FFA members, noted that at WCPFC13, it was agreed that NGOs are to contribute to the meeting expenses as determined by the Executive Director and pay registration fees. FFA Members requested that the requirements relating to contributions and fees also be applicable to Non-Party Observers. In response to a request for clarification from the United States, the Chair indicated these were State observers as referred to in para.1 a) of WCPFC15-2018-06. The United States indicated it would like to have the opportunity for additional dialogue on the issue and would be interested in hearing from the State observers, what their views are, and whether they have a budget for this. In response to a query from Japan, the Chair indicated that only Nicaragua which is applying for CNM status was present as a State observer.  12"
WCPFC15,54,"In response to queries from the United States regarding the “fishing entity” and the more general question from the EU regarding the proposed amendments to Rule 36 of the Rules of Procedure, FSM indicated that the language in the proposal in WCPFC15-2018-DP27 was consistent with the Rules of Procedure, and that the intent was to remove accreditation for the purpose of participation, as opposed to being an observer."
WCPFC15,55,The Commission noted the updated list of observers to the Commission (WCPFC15-2018-06).
WCPFC15,56,"The Commission agreed to amend Rule 36 of the Commission Rules of Procedure as follows:  “4bis The Commission will automatically revoke the observer participation of: (a) any observer organisation, State or fishing entity referred to in paragraph 1 (c), (d), or (e); and/or  (b) a non-governmental organization pursuant to paragraph 4, unless that observer has participated in at least one (1) session of any of the Commission or its subsidiary bodies in the preceding three (3) years, with the three years being a rolling three-year period. The Executive Director shall notify the relevant organisation, State, fishing entity, or non-governmental organization in writing where this rule has been triggered, and observer status revoked, for that organization.  4ter  The automatic revocation of any observer status described in paragraph [4bis] (a) does not preclude that organization, State or fishing entity from reapplying for observer status to the Commission at any time. The automatic revocation of any observer described in paragraph [4bis] (b) does not preclude that non-governmental organization from reapplying for observer status at any time pursuant to paragraph 4.”  3.3 Applications for Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) status"
WCPFC15,57,"The Commission considered applications for Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) status for 2019 in accordance with CMM 2009-11, including recommendations from the 14th meeting of the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC14). As outlined in WCPFC15-2018-07: Cooperating Non-Member Requests for 2019, eight applications for CNM status were received from Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam."
WCPFC15,58,"Tokelau, on behalf of FFA members, noted that Mexico has refused to make a commitment to accept high seas boarding and inspection (HSBI), citing that they have no vessels authorised to fish in the WCPO. Mexico is non-complaint with para 11(e) of CMM 2009-11 which expressly requires CNMs to “accept boarding in accordance with Commission high seas boarding and inspection procedures”. They noted that if Mexico has no vessel authorised to fish in the WCPO, there is even more reason to accept boarding to ensure no unauthorised fishing activity occurs by any of its vessels. Additionally, FFA members maintained their full support for the WCPFC11 decision that CNMs are to provide a contribution to the Commission. This is premised on the principle that all participants in the organisation must share the costs of conservation and management of these stocks, and the contribution is 50% of the amount that would be payable if the CNM was a member. They noted that all other CNMs had paid their financial contribution for 2018, as required under paragraph 2(g) of CMM 2009-11, and thanked them for this, but stated that Mexico had not paid their contribution for 2018. For those reasons, FFA members asked that Mexico’s application for renewal for CNM status be denied unless these issues could be resolved during WCPFC15."
WCPFC15,59,"Nauru, on behalf of the PNA, strongly supported the statement made by Tokelau on behalf of FFA members. It stated that they were no longer prepared to accept the situation where a CNM dictates to  13    the Commission which CMMs they would adhere to, noting that discretion is not given to them in their duty to cooperate under the UN FSA, and is inconsistent with CMM 2009-11."
WCPFC15,60,"The United States thanked delegations for raising those concerns. In reply to their inquiry seeking confirmation if a representative from Mexico was present, the Chair noted that Mexico did not have a representative present."
WCPFC15,61,"Palau, on behalf of FFA members, stated that renewal of CNM status under CMM 2009-11 is conditional upon (a) compliance with measures adopted by the Commission and the fisheries laws and regulations of coastal States in the Convention Area, and (b) compliance with conditions in paragraph 11 of the measure, which includes the acceptance of high seas boarding and inspection. CMM 2009-11 para. 15 is very clear that a CNM that fails to comply with any of the CMMs is deemed to have undermined the effectiveness of the CMM and the Commission must take appropriate action including the revocation of CNM status and non-renewal. They stated that some CNMs have repeatedly been assessed as non-compliant with CMM obligations, and that the Commission must take appropriate action with respect to these CNMs. Further, all CNMs must comply with the requirements under CMM 2009-11, which some are currently not doing. The 2018 provisional CMR identifies that five CNM applicants were rated either non-compliant or priority non-compliant for 2017 activities. The Commission must consider the compliance status of CNMs when considering their applications. Compliance by CNMs with the measures adopted by the Commission is essential, and a clear requirement to participate in the Commission as a CNM. The Commission must take into account CNMs’ level of compliance when determining whether or not to renew their CNM status.  Finally, they noted it is in CNM applicants’ own interest to provide complete and accurate data and information."
WCPFC15,62,"Samoa stated its view that Mexico’s application should be denied, and that it should show a willingness to comply with the CMMs."
WCPFC15,63,"The Chair noted that as a matter of procedure, the Commission would accept or reject the application, and if accepted, refer it to the SWG to consider participatory rights. She noted Mexico’s application was not supported by CCMs in the absence of significant changes.  The Chair further noted that TCC had noted insufficient information was available regarding Nicaragua’s CNM status request and referred the matter to the Commission. The Chair advised the application could be referred to the SWG for further consideration."
WCPFC15,64,"Palau, on behalf of FFA, thanked Nicaragua for its interest in applying for CNM status, and noted that this was the first time Nicaragua had applied to be a CNM. In its application, Nicaragua indicated its commitment to comply with requirements under CMM 2009-11. FFA members sought further information on the following: (i) noting that Nicaragua is a member of IATTC and ICCAT, FFA members inquired regarding its compliance status with these RFMOs; (ii) noting it has 7 purse seiners, inquired regarding its vessels’ compliance status in the RFMOs in which it fishes; and (iii) asked what type of fishing activities, if other than purse seining, Nicaragua is interested in participating in within the WCPO."
WCPFC15,65,"Nicaragua stated it was were happy to answer any questions, and that it complies with all rules in IATTC and ICCAT. It indicated its readiness to comply with WCPFC CMMs and offered to give more information to the SWG."
WCPFC15,66,"PNG, on behalf of FFA members, stated that the decision of the Commission regarding financial contributions by CNMs was very clear. The non-payment of contributions and the lack of commitment to do so has been a subject of extensive discussion at previous Commission meetings. They stated that FFA members will not agree to CNM status for any applicant that has not paid outstanding financial  14    contributions or is unable to commit to making the contribution for the following year. Additionally, the Commission must take appropriate action for those CNMs that have blatantly undermined any CMMs and any requirement prescribed by the Commission."
WCPFC15,67,"The United States indicated it would be happy to have discussions regarding Nicaragua’s application. Regarding the broader issues, it noted that it did not consider financial contributions from CNMs to be a binding requirement. It stated that States faced a range of considerations in making voluntary contributions. WCPFC rules state that financial contributions are required only from States that are eligible to be members, but a number of CCMs have made it clear they do not wish to consider new members, suggesting CNM applicants should not be required to make financial contributions."
WCPFC15,68,"The Chair asked the SWG to consider Nicaragua’s application, which would be returned to plenary, with the financial contribution considered at that time."
WCPFC15,69,"Solomon Islands, on behalf of FFA members, stated that TCC14 noted that Panama provided its Annual Report Parts 1 and 2, but that there were reporting gaps requiring clarification. The Secretariat wrote to Panama (letters dated 19 October 2018) identifying the gaps and requesting the provision of additional information 30 days before WCPFC15, while Panama provided additional information on December 8. They noted that Panama was consistently non-compliant in the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) for serious violations of its obligations, and it was unclear whether Panama had addressed those non-compliance issues."
WCPFC15,70,"The Commission agreed to accept the applications for renewal of CNM status in 2019 submitted by Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Thailand and Vietnam. Members deferred consideration of requests from Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama pending further review by the SWG."
WCPFC15,71,"The SWG considering the CNM participatory rights made the following recommendations, in WCPFC15-2018-CNM_SWG01: SWG CNM Report (Final): i The SWG noted with appreciation the attendance and participation of Ecuador, Liberia, Panama and Nicaragua.  ii The SWG agreed to recommend that the CNMs accepted by the WCPFC plenary (i.e. Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Thailand and Vietnam) have the same participatory rights in 2019 as they had in 2018. iii Noting Nicaragua was a new CNM applicant, the SWG asked Nicaragua for further information on its compliance in IATTC and ICCAT, and to outline its prospective interests in the WCPFO. iv Nicaragua submitted documentation, including a letter of good standing from IATTC and evidence that no Nicaraguan flagged vessel was on either the IATTC or ICCAT IUU Vessel List.  Nicaragua explained that it was a Member of ICCAT but had no active fishing vessels in its Convention Area. Nicaragua affirmed its commitment to make a voluntary contribution. On the basis of the information provided, the SWG agreed to recommend that the Commission accept Nicaragua’s application. v With respect to Nicaragua’s participatory rights, the SWG recommends that Nicaragua’s participatory rights should be limited to purse seine fishing for one vessel, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area. The SWG further agreed to recommend that any introduction of fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2017-01 or its replacement measure. vi The SWG noted that Mexico had neither attended the Commission meeting nor responded to the Executive Director’s letter, and that this made it challenging to assess Mexico’s application. Some  15    members reiterated the importance of accepting a commitment to accept high seas boarding and inspection and a voluntary contribution; while other Members indicated flexibility on these aspects, noting that such commitments can be difficult to make in the absence of a binding treaty-level obligation. vii There was no consensus to recommend acceptance of Mexico’s CNM status. viii The SWG considered Panama’s application, noting the TCC’s advice that Panama had submitted its Part 1 and Part 2 Reports on time but that there were reporting gaps that could require clarification, and that some CCMs had also noted that Panama is consistently non-compliant in SPRFMO. ix Panama explained that it had worked closely with the SPRFMO Secretariat to address its outstanding data and compliance issues. x The SWG, with the support of Panama, recommends to WCPFC15 that Panama’s application be accepted, and that Panama should: a. Prepare an action plan outlining how it will improve its compliance with WCPFC, including to ensure that relevant data is provided on time and any improvement to its internal procedures necessary to improve its cooperation with WCPFC. This Action Plan should be provided to the Commission no later than the end of January 2019, and circulated to all CCMs; b. Provide all outstanding data no later than the end of January 2019 to the Secretariat; and c. Enhance its engagement with the Secretariat to ensure it can meet relevant reporting requirements. xi The SWG agreed that Panama’s participatory rights should remain as they were in 2018."
WCPFC15,72,"The Commission approved the applications for CNM status for 2019 from Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Thailand and Vietnam."
WCPFC15,73,"WCPFC also approved the application for CNM status for 2019 from Panama, subject to Panama: a Preparing an action plan outlining how it will improve its compliance with WCPFC, including to ensure that relevant data is provided on time and any improvement to its internal procedures necessary to improve its cooperation with WCPFC.  This Action Plan should be provided to the Commission by no later than the end of January 2019, and circulated to all CCMs; b Providing all outstanding data by no later than the end of January 2019 to the Secretariat; and c Enhancing its engagement with the Secretariat to ensure it can meet relevant reporting requirements."
WCPFC15,74,"Ecuador thanked WCPFC15 for approving Ecuador’s CNM application and reminded delegates that Ecuador has been insisting on the need to have a legal and transparent procedure for accession to full membership of the WCPFC. It noted that a change in the CNM application format was implemented by WCPFC13 asking applicants whether they would want to become a full member, and observed that this information had been useless, because no further steps had been taken to set up rules to make this happen. Ecuador stated that the United States presented a discussion paper in 2017 (WCPFC14-2017-DP18: Membership process in WCPFC), which addressed the most relevant elements of the issue, but action has not been taken to develop a procedure to address the issue. It stated that Ecuador has been a  16    CNM for many years, and that Ecuador and other Latin American and Asian countries had been asking to be full members for several years but had not received an adequate answer. Ecuador observed that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the UN FSA state that RFMOs shall not discriminate against any state or group of states having a real interest in the fisheries concerned. It stated that in coming to WCPFC annual meetings year after year and asking WCPFC to address the issue but not being listened to made them feel very much discriminated against as a country and member of the international community. It reminded delegates that following adoption by IATTC of a new Convention in 2003 (The Antigua Convention) several countries including, Belize, Canada, China, and Kiribati — became full members of the RFMO very easily, without impediments. It recalled having heard that the WCPFC is considered unique and stated that while it was sure this was the case, that uniqueness could not contravene specific principles of international law and the WCPFC Convention itself. Ecuador emphasized that the fear that some member countries might feel with regard to accepting new members had no basis, because it was very clear to it that becoming a member would not carry any automatic entitlement for participatory rights different than those it had as a CNM. Ecuador closed by encouraging delegates to set up a transparent framework and conditions for inviting new members, and specifically asked the Commission to accept Ecuador to become a full member."
WCPFC15,75,"The United States thanked Ecuador for its statement and agreed that the issue of membership was important. The United States noted it had not submitted an update to WCPFC14-2017-DP18 because there was not a lot of new information available, and the Commission had a very full agenda. It observed there was no apparent way forward, noting that some members obviously view the Commission as closed, while it and other CCMs had a different view. The United States acknowledged that invitations to new membership required consensus and stated it had never suggested that any particular application should be approved, but only that there should a clear process for application, and an examination of the costs and benefits of accepting new members. It indicated this was only fair to other members of the international community that had asked to be considered for membership. The United States indicated it would be happy to discuss the issue intersessionally."
WCPFC15,76,"Tuvalu, on behalf of FFA members, reiterated that the application for CNM status is not a stepping stone to becoming a full member of the WCPFC."
WCPFC15,77,"The EU expressed agreement with the intervention from Ecuador. It stated that according to UNCLOS and the UN FSA, countries with fishing interests for highly migratory species in the region had the right to become full members of the WCPFC, and to refuse membership the WCPFC would need to have good reasons. The EU stated the WCPFC risked having a case presented to the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea, which would not be good for the Commission."
WCPFC15,78,Canada encouraged holding a dialog as suggested by the United States.
WCPFC15,79,"Palau, on behalf of PNA, stated that new members must be invited by consensus. It stated that the language had been carefully drafted to reflect the special situation of the Commission, and that they did not see that changing in the future.  3.3.1 Participatory rights of CNMs"
WCPFC15,80,"The Commission agreed to the following limits to be applied to the participatory rights of CNMs (Convention / CMM 2009-11):  17    a) In accordance with the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following participatory rights apply to CNMs for fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area;  b) In addition, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under their national jurisdiction or other CCMs’ national jurisdiction, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements;  c) CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPFC Convention and the WCPFC conservation and management measures. In addition, CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV);  d) CCMs shall ensure that CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention; and  e) Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will take into account compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, and all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPFC Convention. CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the Secretariat for attention by TCC.  Participatory rights of each CNM in 2019"
WCPFC15,81,"Ecuador: The participatory rights of Ecuador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2018-01 or its replacement measure."
WCPFC15,82,El Salvador: The participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. The total level of effort by purse seine vessels of El Salvador on the high seas shall not exceed 29 days in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2018-01 or its replacement measure.
WCPFC15,83,"Liberia: The participatory rights of Liberia are limited to reefer vessels to engage in transhipment activities, and bunker and supply vessels to support fishing vessels in the Convention area."
WCPFC15,84,"Nicaragua: The participatory rights of Nicaragua are limited to purse seine fishing for one vessel, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area. Any introduction of fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11 and CMM 2018-01 or its replacement measure."
WCPFC15,85,"Panama: The participatory rights of Panama in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels. Panama’s participatory rights also apply to vessels that supply food, water and spare parts to carrier vessels that engage in transhipment activities, provided that these vessels do not engage in activities supporting fishing vessels, including providing and/or servicing FADs."
WCPFC15,86,Thailand: The participatory rights of Thailand in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.   18
WCPFC15,87,Vietnam: The participatory rights of Vietnam in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.    WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area
WCPFC15,88,"In accordance with the decision of WCPFC9 regarding the management of the overlap area of 4˚S and between 130˚W and 150˚W, vessels flagged to Ecuador, El Salvador Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama will be governed by the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area."
WCPFC15,89,"In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area."
WCPFC15,90,"For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with international and domestic laws, vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area.   AGENDA ITEM 4  — NEW PROPOSALS   4.1 Marine Pollution"
WCPFC15,91,"Canada presented WCPFC15-2018-DP02: Discussion paper — potential future amendments to WCPFC CMM on marine pollution (2017-04), which proposes changes to the measure for consideration (at WCPFC15, or when it is evaluated in the future). Canada suggested modifications to strengthen requirements regarding retrieval and reporting of lost fishing gear by vessels operating in the Convention Area.  4.2 Non-Entangling FADs"
WCPFC15,92,The EU introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP01: Proposal for amending CMM 2017-01 for the use of non-entangling FADs in WCPFC fisheries.
WCPFC15,93,The issue was addressed under Agenda Item 6.3.1a.  4.3 FAD Definitions
WCPFC15,94,"The United States introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP03: Proposal for a definition of fish aggregating device, and Korea introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP17: Proposed changes to conservation and management measure 2009-02 on the application of high seas FAD closures and catch retention."
WCPFC15,95,The issue was addressed under Agenda Item 6.3.1c.  19    4.4 Bigeye Longline Catch Limits
WCPFC15,96,"The United States introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP04: Proposal on bigeye longline catch limits in longline fisheries: Conservation and Management Measure on Tropical Tunas, which addresses para. 40 of the measure and proposes an objective method to adjust CCMs’ longline bigeye tuna catch limits to account for their respective levels of monitoring and control, particularly with respect to observer coverage levels and at-sea transhipment activity."
WCPFC15,97,"Korea thanked the United States for its efforts to fight IUU fishing and to submit a plan to improve reliability of data on the longline fishery, while noting the need for further consideration of the issue. Korea noted that the United States faces different conditions than other fishing nations, as it has Hawaii and American Samoa available as fishing bases, and stated that in its view it would be inappropriate to directly link observer and transhipment coverage to catch limits. It suggested the need for further discussion."
WCPFC15,98,"The issue was considered by the SWG on the tropical tuna measure, refer Agenda Item 6.3.1. 4.5 IMO Numbers"
WCPFC15,99,The United States introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP05: Amendment to CMM 2017-05 to expand the requirement for IMO numbers.
WCPFC15,100,The issue was addressed under Agenda Item 9.3.3.  4.6 Sea Turtles
WCPFC15,101,The United States introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP06: Revisions to CMM 2008-03 Conservation and Management Measure of Sea Turtles and WCPFC15-2018-DP07: Amendments to the WCPFC Regional Observer Programme Minimum Standard Data Fields.
WCPFC15,102,The issue was discussed under Agenda Item 8.5. 4.7 South Pacific Albacore Target Reference Point
WCPFC15,103," Fiji, on behalf of FFA members, introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP10: Proposal for establishing a target reference point for south Pacific albacore."
WCPFC15,104,The issue was addressed under Agenda Item 6.2.2. 4.8 Implementation of CMM 2013-06
WCPFC15,105,"Cook Islands, on behalf of FFA members, presented WCPFC15-2018-DP12_rev1: Views on the implementation of CMM 2013-06 (CMM on the Criteria for the Consideration of Conservation and Management Measures), stating they were pleased to see some improvement in how CMM proponents complete CMM 2013-06 impact assessments, although much improvement in the quality of the assessments was needed, which reflects CCMs’ poor understanding of what SIDS considerations are when these CCMs are designing potential measures. They noted that to overcome this, proponents must consult with SIDS, which is a fundamental element of the CMM 2013-06 assessments. Without this input, proponents will not be able to address implementation issues and adequately identify disproportionate burden, which requires collaboration and consultation with SIDS before proposals are submitted to WCPFC. WCPFC15-2018-DP12 (rev.1) seeks to help address this issue; it includes an  20    annotation of the questions in paragraph 3 of CMM 2013-06 for the SIDS impact assessments, to provide more structured guidance to inform how responses are developed. They hoped the Commission would find this useful to support CCMs in their development of proposals. They stated that genuine consideration of CMM proposals by SIDS requires active engagement, and that FFA members meet every year in October for management options consultations (MOC), which are dedicated to developing and reviewing work that will contribute to the annual Commission meeting, which was an opportune time for consideration of proposals. They thanked CCMs who provided proposals for consideration during their MOC meeting and looked forward to working with others and further enhancing the development and use of CMM 2013-06 assessments."
WCPFC15,106,"RMI supported the comments by Cook Islands on behalf of FFA, while noting the number of proposals submitted under Agenda Item 4 at WCPFC15 and stressing it would consider CMM 2013-06 and its applicable mechanisms with respect to any proposals under consideration."
WCPFC15,107,"The United States stated that guidance on how to improve implementation would be useful, but that it had not anticipated it would be formally adopted. It suggested that the delegation paper be noted, or the issues be further developed intersessionally. This position was supported by the EU; it also stated it understood the concerns expressed by FFA and underlined that it always assesses the potential impact of their proposals on SIDS but might face difficulties in exactly determining these impacts."
WCPFC15,108,"RMI noted CMM 2013-06 continued to be less than effective from the view of SIDS and participating territories, and the guidelines were being suggested to help in implementing the CMM and to help all CCMs meet their obligations; it stressed WCPFC15-2018-DP12 contained guiding questions, not obligations. RMI also thanked Japan for its continuous engagement with SIDS."
WCPFC15,109,"The EU thanked RMI and stated that it sought to faithfully implement CMM 2013-06 whenever it proposes a measure, and to engage proactively with FFA. It welcomed having the document as a reference submitted by FFA, but not as document to be approved by the Commission."
WCPFC15,110,"In the ensuing discussions, the Commission explored various ways in which the document could be made available to members for reference."
WCPFC15,111,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat to include WCPFC15-2018-DP12_rev1 providing FFA CCM views on the implementation of CMM 2013-06, on the webpage that will be established for and dedicated to the Implementation of Article 30 of the Convention.    4.9 Labour Standards"
WCPFC15,112,"Vanuatu, on behalf of FFA members, introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP13: Draft Resolution on Labour Standards for Crew on Fishing Vessels, and stated that Ministers from FFA members had reiterated that human rights abuses on fishing vessels operating in the Pacific must be addressed, and emphasised specifically the need for improved labour standards for all crew, including as part of the ongoing promotion of opportunities for Pacific Islanders working in the fishing industry. They stated the issue had rightly received significant international attention, thanked CCMs for providing constructive comments on the proposal to date, and voiced their appreciation for the support from all CCMs and the Commission to address the issue. They invited other CCMs to engage with FFA members in the margins of WCPFC15 to support progress of this resolution, including suggestions for improvement, and stated they view the resolution as a vital first step to ensure CCMs work constructively together to eliminate all human rights abuses inflicted on crew on fishing vessels. They  21    noted it was fitting that this was being discussed on the 70th Anniversary of the Declaration on Human Rights."
WCPFC15,113,The issue was further discussed by a small working group.
WCPFC15,114,"The EU stated it fully supported the principles put forward, that these were present in its own laws, and that its vessels fully respected them, but expressed doubts about the legal basis of the WCPFC to adopt a Resolution on labour standards under Article 10(h) of the Convention. This view was supported by Japan, who also supported the concept, but questioned whether the Commission was the proper venue to address the issues and stated it would not support the resolution being converted to a binding document in a future Commission meeting. China thanked Vanuatu for accommodating its concerns during the course of small working group discussions, and stated its belief that the issue should be addressed elsewhere, but agreed to support the resolution because it was not binding."
WCPFC15,115,The Commission adopted Resolution 2018-01 on Labour Standards for Crew on Fishing Vessels (Attachment E)
WCPFC15,116,"WWF, on behalf of IPNLF, WWF, Pew, and BirdLife International, commended the Commission for adopting the Resolution on Labour Standards for Crew on Fishing Vessels. They noted that WCPFC is the first tuna RFMO to consider this issue, and they thanked the Commission for its leadership in progressing fishery worker protections. They stated that human rights and labour abuses occur around the world, including in Pacific tuna fisheries, with stories of fishers being paid less than what they were promised, and stories of fishers being beaten, enslaved, or murdered. They stated that buyers and consumers expect their tuna to be free of human exploitation, and WCPFC has taken an important step in response. They supported WCPFC’s initiative in passing the resolution and urged the Commission to consider how to make the provisions substantive and effective."
WCPFC15,117,"Vanuatu noted the important progress WCPFC had made on many issues, and emphasized the importance of this accomplishment, stating that poor labour conditions and mistreatment of crew cannot be tolerated, and it was essential all crew are afforded their basic human rights. Cook Islands also commended all members on taking a decision to protect the welfare of crew on fishing vessels. Cook Islands stated that the resolution was a first step and it would continue to work on the issue until workers at sea are more effectively protected. Indonesia expressed appreciation to FFA for their efforts and for the leadership shown by Vanuatu on the issue, and echoed Cook Island’s view that this marked only a first step in protecting and ensuring the safety of labour at sea. 4.10 Seabird Mitigation"
WCPFC15,118,New Zealand introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP16: Seabird Interaction Mitigation: Amendment of CMM 2017-06.
WCPFC15,119,The issue was addressed under Agenda Item 8.4.   4.11 TCC Workplan
WCPFC15,120,The TCC Vice-Chair (RMI) introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP19: Update of TCC Workplan.
WCPFC15,121,The issue was addressed under Agenda Item 9.3  22    4.12 Pacific Bluefin Tuna
WCPFC15,122,Japan introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP25: Proposal for amending Conservation and Management Measure for Pacific Bluefin Tuna (CMM2017-08).
WCPFC15,123,The issue was addressed under Agenda Item 6.4.  4.13 Effective Participation of SIDS
WCPFC15,124,Niue introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP26: Proposal to amend the financial Regulations for the effective participation of SIDS.
WCPFC15,125,The issue was addressed under Agenda Item 5.  4.14 High Seas Boarding and Inspection: Authorities of the Fishing Vessel
WCPFC15,126,The United States introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP31: High Seas Boarding and Inspection: Authorities of the Fishing Vessel (originally notified under Circular 2018/74).
WCPFC15,127,The issue was addressed under Agenda Item 9.3.5.    AGENDA ITEM 5  — SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES  5.1 Implementation of Article 30 of WCPFC Convention and CMM 2013-07 (SIDS special requirements)
WCPFC15,128,"The Chair noted that para. 20 of CMM 2013-07 requires an annual review of implementation of this measure, and referenced WCPFC15-2018-IP01: Summary from Part 2 CMM 2013-07 paragraph 19 annual reports (WCPFC-TCC14-2018-11) and WCPFC15-2018-DP21: Report of the European Union on Article 30 of the Convention and Resolution 2008-01 of WCPFC (EU)."
WCPFC15,129,"Japan stated it fully recognized the importance of using the checklist in CMM 2013-06 and would continue doing so. It also stressed that more important is direct consultation with SIDS, where common grounds and differing views could be identified, and gaps filled. It stated it had held a number of intersessional consultations with SIDS, and would continue to do so in the future, and encouraged other CCMs to do the same. It noted it had provided overseas development assistance for infrastructure and capacity development equal to US$4.1 billion over 2007–2016, which includes fisheries related projects, focussing on conservation and management of highly migratory species and assistance to small-scale fishermen. Japan noted the recent commitment by Prime Minister Abe for additional assistance related to human resource development, including over 5,000 people-to-people exchanges over the coming three years. Established in 2008, the Japan Trust Fund within WCPFC has assisted SIDS with capacity development for fisheries statistics and management. Japan has also provided support for SIDS through the Japan Promotion Fund via Overseas Fishery Cooperation Foundation of Japan (OFCF) so SIDS can use interest from the fund for various purposes. In November 2017 this was renewed until 2027. Japan expressed the hope these projects and funds would contribute to the development of SIDS."
WCPFC15,130,"The United States stated that it had provided a report related to the agenda item through its Annual Report Part 2. Assistance includes bilateral and multilateral assistance to SIDS-related fisheries as well as assistance through WCPFC, such as voluntary contributions to the SRF. It noted that when looking  23    through the reports contained in IP01 it was hard to find detailed attachments, making accessing the relevant data difficult. The United States suggested that in the future it would prepare a delegation paper similar to WCPFC15-2018-DP21 and stated it would be happy to provide specific information to other CCMs on request. It also supported the provision of information on a dedicated webpage."
WCPFC15,131,"The EU stated that although it prepared a report each year, it seemed that it was not being read, because discussions in FAC and at other times seemed to support that view. The EU suggested that in 2019 when the Commission holds discussions in relation to application of Article 30 and related issues that development cooperation provided by members for SIDS directly related to WCPFC be detailed in the annexes prepared by the Secretariat for all members to review."
WCPFC15,132,"Palau, on behalf of FFA members, stated that the Special Requirements agenda item is always a priority. Embedding and operationalising the provisions of Article 30 across all aspects of the Commission’s work requires CCMs to acknowledge and commit to responding to particular issues as they arise. FFA members are pleased with recent work that should provide more structure and responsiveness to how the Commission will support developing state CCMs in meeting their obligations. They directed attention to: (i) ensuring the effective participation of developing States, (ii) facilitating the effective participation of developing States in the work of the Commission, and (iii) ensuring SIDS impact assessments required by CMM 2013-06 are comprehensively developed through more considered and consultative approaches. They looked forward to working with other CCMs in progressing these issues."
WCPFC15,133,"Nauru supported the comments from Palau and stated that the fact SIDS are overburdened contributed to difficulties in absorbing all information, and to the frustrations highlighted by the EU. Nauru noted this was why it was asking for SIDS support. 5.2 Strategic Investment Plan by the FAC Special Requirements Fund Virtual Working Group."
WCPFC15,134,"Dr Liz Brierley (Australia), Chair of the SRF-IWG introduced WCPFC15-2018-FAC_SRF IWG: Report from the Chair of the Special Requirements Fund Intersessional Working Group (SRF IWG) to the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC) of WCPFC. She briefly reviewed the history of the SRF-IWG and provided an update on the intersessional work of the SRF-IWG in 2018. The SRF-IWG engaged a research assistant (funded by New Zealand), who identified capacity needs of developing states and territories documented through WCPFC processes, and identified funding options available to fill these needs, both within provisions of the WCPFC and externally. The analysis demonstrated that most capacity development needs had associated support mechanisms. Members were asked to rank capacity development needs according to the priority they afforded the need from their national perspective. The responses were then aggregated. Some members felt that, despite access to the SRF, effective participation was inadequately supported by the Commission. She noted that members have differing views as to what effective participation means, particularly with regard to capability.  The Strategic Investment Plan (SIP) notes the need for flexibility to respond to the needs of individual countries, and for travel assistance for members to send two participants to Commission meetings. There is also a need for more in-country capacity building and support that does not remove people from their work. The SIP also documents capacity building needs documented in the TCC CMR, and WCPFC Part 2 Annual Reports. She stated the Commission should consider whether capacity development needs could become public domain data in the future, noting a need for greater transparency in implementation of Article 30. The SIP noted that some members raised the need for a consolidated page on the WCPFC website to record: capacity needs (as detailed in the current SIP); funding options, eligibility and application processes (including references to external funding mechanisms as raised through Annual Part 2 reports and work of the SRF-IWG); SRF funding proposals and SRF project completion reports  24    for projects under US$10,000 (enhanced transparency); 2013-06 templates and assessments; and reports by CCMs on implementation of 2013-07."
WCPFC15,135,"The SRF-IWG Chair noted the need for members to consider three (3) issues: (a) approval of the SIP, and thus whether the Commission would support the participation of two delegates from SIDS at Commission meetings; (b) making capacity needs of Part 2 Annual reports and the pCMR publicly available through a website dedicated to implementation of Article 30; and (c) agreement regarding enhanced transparency mechanisms around implementation of Article 30."
WCPFC15,136,"Niue introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP26: Proposal to amend the financial regulations for the effective participation of SIDS, noting that FFA members remain steadfast in their resolve to ensure the Commission enables the effective participation of SIDS in its work. They stated that ensuring effective and inclusive participation for all CCMs and providing the opportunity for those who need help in doing so, is a priority for FFA members, and in their view is the responsibility of the Commission and all CCMs. Effective and inclusive participation will ensure the Commission can continue developing robust fisheries management arrangements that take into account all members’ needs. WCPFC15-2018-DP26 proposes an amendment to the financial regulations to provide support for two SIDS delegates to attend Commission meetings but noted this was simply a starting point. They stated they were open to investigating different avenues, such as the funding proposals provided in the report of the SRF-IWG and recognised that all members needed to approach the issue with flexibility and understanding so that SIDS have the opportunity to build their capacity and capability to engage and participate in the Commission decision-making processes."
WCPFC15,137,"Tuvalu, on behalf of FFA members, extended their appreciation to the SRF-IWG Chair for her efforts in guiding development of the SIP, which would ensure that the Commission can direct capacity building assistance when and where it is required. Tuvalu noted that the detail of this work would be considered in the FAC, but raised the following points:  (i) Maintenance of the SIP is not a one-off process but requires the Commission and CCMs to incorporate it in various work streams to update and maintain the relevance of the SIP, in particular, the ongoing need to support developing States in implementing their obligations under the WCPFC. (ii) The SIP should be used as a basis to inform what assistance is required, where the priorities lie, and how these priority capacity building needs will be resourced. (iii) The need to provide support to facilitate effective participation. They stated that WCPFC15-2018-DP26 was a starting point but recognised that some CCMs may not be comfortable with this approach, and stated they were open to hearing other options, and being flexible on how to achieve this."
WCPFC15,138,"Tuvalu further stated that building the capability of individuals working in small fisheries administrations is a fundamental responsibility of the Commission, along with ensuring that the small fisheries administrations (which are dedicated to ensuring the Commission achieves its sustainable management objectives) are able to comprehend, engage and participate in, and effectively contribute to the work that culminates in deliberations at annual sessions, such as WCPFC15. The mechanism established by the Commission to do this is the SRF. Tuvalu stated the need to ensure that the SRF is sustainably supported by the Commission to enable it to deliver required capacity building assistance. Tuvalu looked forward to working with other CCMs to propel the SIP as the platform for delivering meaningful assistance."
WCPFC15,139,"The United States requested clarification on how aspects of the proposals would be implemented. FSM supported the comments made by Tuvalu and agreed that the issues could be discussed in greater  25    detail. It suggested the need to look carefully at what information is divulged from Part 2 reports, as some must be kept confidential."
WCPFC15,140,"The Chair observed that all members were likely able to support the principle of transparency, noting that the proposal was intended to support members, while acknowledging the need to understand what information was being made public. She confirmed the SRF-IWG Chair would develop a paper and the discussion on (b) and (c) (in para. 135 above) would then be resumed. On (a), she noted Tuvalu had referenced WCPFC15-2018-DP26, and stated that the Commission needed to look at how to fund effective participation, and that the FAC needed guidance as it looks at how to fund this. She observed that SIDS had indicated their needs, and that significant work had gone into developing the IWG outcomes, and that the Commission needed to look at how it would support those needs."
WCPFC15,141,"Japan indicated it supported the concept of funding a second person and understood there should be at least two people at each meeting, but raised the need for caution, as funding two delegates would increase the budget, and require a larger financial contribution from CCMs. It accepted that FAC needed direction but stated that they could not voice support until it was known how to fund participation by two delegates (e.g. through increased contributions or by dropping some projects), and the associated fiscal and program implications had been determined."
WCPFC15,142,The Chair noted the need for general in-principle support from the Commission; following that the FAC could develop options and submit those back to the Commission.
WCPFC15,143,"The EU observed that the issue is complex. It voiced support for helping to facilitate effective participation and capacity building by SIDS, but suggested that further support be integrated in the SIP, and separate from funding of WCPFC. It noted that the EU has other funds available to support development, but that funds for WCPFC are limited, and the EU’s contribution cannot always be increased. The EU noted that the issue was mainly development related and therefore should be preferentially addressed through the instruments available to fund development outside WCPFC. It also noted that Article 30 of the Convention refers to facilitating effective participation, not ineludibly ensuring effective participation, which is already in place and effective participation is not necessarily dependent on the number of representatives from a country; in this context, it observed that at other RFMOs, support was provided only for one person, and that the EU was in some cases represented by only one person. The EU agreed that having more representatives was a benefit, but suggested delegations of one could also be effective. It questioned whether additional funding would in fact support a third representative if a second was already in place, as SRF funds the participation of a second person for some developing states. It also suggested that needs varied among countries, and that for a lesser-developed country the situation would be different than for an emerging economy, although both may be SIDS. It observed that some small country delegations were relatively large and global effective and substantial participation of SIDS is already in place, which should be taken into account. The EU expressed its concern that financial contributions to WCPFC were increasing and noted that the IWG report presents some different options for funding participation of a second person. It suggested the need to set priorities, and see which countries were most in need of assistance for funding a second representative."
WCPFC15,144,"Cook Islands voiced strong support for the position put forward by FFA members, noting the issue was in fact not as complex as the current discussion suggested. It stated that the Commission is a decision-making body, and at the heart of the Convention is ensuring the effective participation by all members, and that SIDS have articulated what this means to them. It thanked the IWG for its work and noted that it identified several critical issues: numbers; capacity to participate; and being able to attend and participate in all elements of Commission meetings. The Cook Islands stated the need for the Commission to take a decision on principle, and to agree that effective participation means two persons  26    for each SIDS, while leaving the options for how this could be funded to the FAC, which could reprioritize some funding lines, rather than necessarily increasing individual contributions."
WCPFC15,145,"Niue thanked the Chair of the SRF-IWG and stated that it was one of the countries that had been advocating for effective participation. It agreed that the SRF was an option but stated that it posed an administrative burden on SIDS and the Secretariat. It supported the statement by Cook Islands and observed that for one person to attend from a country was ridiculous. It stated that effective participation required more than just support for travel, and that it was not possible to compare countries such as the EU and Niue. It observed that having two or three people attend Commission meetings was also part of its continuity and succession plan, and that it needed to be able to be prepared to engage in the working groups. Niue closed by emphasizing the need to have two people at the Commission meetings."
WCPFC15,146,"Canada thanked the SRF-IWG Chair and noted WCPFC15-2018-DP26. It agreed this is a core element of the Commission’s work and noted Canada had made some small voluntary contributions. It expressed the concern that if the Commission agreed to the approach in DP26 (as opposed to flexible funding of the SRF), the result could be that two delegates are funded, in place of possibly other support such as funding one delegate and increasing capacity development. Canada suggested looking at funding SRF but retaining flexibility for how that funding is used."
WCPFC15,147,"Samoa expressed thanks for the support expressed for the proposal. It noted the small size of its delegation, and questioned what effective participation means, suggesting it was much more than just being at the Commission meeting. It noted the number of working groups, and the difficulty attending and preparing for these, all of which have an impact on Samoa and the Pacific. It noted that the support being discussed was in fact itself insufficient to enable Samoa to effectively participate. Samoa noted the pressure SIDS face, as they lack the budget to attend the meetings, but are forced to make funds available to enable their attendance. It noted that SIDS are home to the fisheries resources that are being discussed by WCPFC. Samoa urged the Commission to fully consider the issues, and understand that while the proposal entailed extra expense, it would help in conserving the region’s fisheries resource and making these available to all."
WCPFC15,148,"Nauru thanked Canada for its support on the issue and observed that the SRF was already funding some additional delegates, but suggested that SRF funding should be used to increase the capacity of SIDS’ fisheries departments; in contrast, the funding in question was not developmental, but was to ensure the Commission can conduct its business. It noted that as an alternative it would be possible to implement Rule 1 of the Rules of Procedure, which requires that the Commission has just two meetings per year. Nauru suggested a readiness to look at budget reallocation to find the necessary funding."
WCPFC15,149,"Kiribati shared the views expressed by other SIDS, and acknowledged the assistance provided by developed states through the SRF and various trust funds, which have provided assistance to Kiribati. It lent its support to the statements of other FFA members, noting that their participation in the Commission meetings was vital, both as members of the Commission, and because much of the fishing activity in the WCPO take place in the waters of SIDS. It noted that it was very hard for SIDS to attend without having sufficient expertise and stated that their contribution has increased annually. Kiribati highlighted that its revenue from fishing constituted a basic contribution to the government’s budget, and stated it was happy that this issue was being considered."
WCPFC15,150,"RMI supported the comments by FFA members and stressed the need to end comparisons with other RFMOs, given the number of WCPFC members that are SIDS for whom these issues are of great importance. It highlighted the number of scientific issues on the agenda, stating SIDS face challenges in monitoring, managing observers, and carrying out other activities, and suggested more support was needed.  27"
WCPFC15,151,"The United States thanked the SRF-IWG and FFA members for providing DP26 and the views of their delegations, noting it appreciated how important the issue was to members and the Commission, and the broad support for the issue in principle. It noted the progress in building the SRF (to about US$150,000 in 2018), while appreciating the challenge of adequately supporting the SRF through voluntary contributions alone. It indicated their preference was to provide support through mandatory contributions to the SRF, with priorities then determined. The United States stated that it did want to see how this would affect overall contributions, which could be examined by FAC."
WCPFC15,152,"The Chair thanked members for their constructive interventions, noting the increased scope and workload of the Commission, which had not been met with an increase in support for all members to participate, and which led to the formation of the SRF-IWG. She surmised that the principle is broadly supported and appreciated the suggestion from Cook Islands that a reprioritization of the budget could be needed. She noted that the issue would be forwarded to the FAC with the provision that support be provided, and allow FAC to consider how this could best be done, with a report back to the plenary by the FAC."
WCPFC15,153,"Following the adoption of the Report of the FAC under Agenda item 12, and noting that this had considered funding to support the implementation of the Strategic Investment Plan, the Commission agreed to the following outcomes."
WCPFC15,154,"The Commission approved the 2018 Strategic Investment Plan as a means to target investment to address the priority needs as identified by developing states, including effective participation. (Attachment F).  The Commission agreed that this Plan would be updated annually by the Secretariat for approval by the Commission and that the Secretariat would report to the Commission on implementation of the Strategic Investment Plan each year."
WCPFC15,155,"The Commission agreed to make any capacity assistance needs identified in the provisional Compliance Monitoring Report and in Part 2 reports (as may be agreed by TCC each year to be contained in the Executive Summary of the Provisional Compliance Monitoring Report), public domain data that will inform annual updates of the Strategic Investment Plan."
WCPFC15,156,The Commission agreed to make the reports against implementation of 2013-07 (or its successor) contained in Part 2 Annual Reports public domain data.
WCPFC15,157,"The Commission directed the Secretariat to develop a webpage dedicated to the Implementation of Article 30 of the Convention. The Commission considered that the publicly available website would include the following information: • Current and historical Strategic Investment Plans • Funding options, eligibility and application processes • Special Requirements Fund proposals and project completion reports for projects >$10,000 • 2013-06 template and assessments to date  • Reports by CCMs on implementation of 2013-07     28    AGENDA ITEM 6  — WCPO TUNA AND BILLFISH STOCKS"
WCPFC15,158,"The Chair opened the session by acknowledging the contributions made by Dr John Hampton (SPC) to the work of the Commission, and management of tuna stocks in the region more broadly, noting that he would be stepping down as head of SPC’s Ocean Fisheries Programme in the coming year. She observed that his role was hard to summarize but stated that 2018 marked the 30th year he had attended an annual meeting on the status of the region’s tuna stocks, and that his sustained contribution from a scientific perspective was peerless. 6.1 General Overview of Stock Status (bigeye, skipjack, SP albacore, yellowfin, Pacific bluefin, NP albacore and NP swordfish)"
WCPFC15,159,"Dr John Hampton (SPC) provided a presentation on Status of Stocks and Fisheries, which represented recent information on the fisheries, focusing on purse seine and longline; the status of key tuna species assessed by SPC (skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye, and South Pacific albacore; and some information on ENSO and the impacts of climate change on tuna stocks. He noted that more detailed information was available in WCPFC15-2018-IP12: The western and central Pacific tuna fishery: 2017 Overview and status of stocks. He noted 2017 WCP-CA tuna catches by species as follows: (i) skipjack (64% of the total catch) was a drop from the highest value, recorded in 2014, and a decrease of 10% from 2016; (ii) yellowfin (27%) was a record catch; (iii) bigeye (5%) was the lowest since 1996; and (iv) albacore (4%) was a record catch. He noted that the bigeye catch was not a significant portion of the total catch but was important in terms of the impact on bigeye stocks.  Purse seine effort appeared similar to the level over the last three years. A large increase in purse seine sets on free schools (unassociated sets) was recorded since 2010, and a slight contraction in associated sets since 2011, related to implementation of the FAD closures. Many of the unassociated sets are “skunk sets”, with little catch recorded; once that is taken into account, the number of successful associated and unassociated sets is quite similar. There is significant variability in purse seine catch per unit effort (CPUE); FAD closures since 2009 have had a significant effect on bigeye CPUE, which is the goal. Overall CPUE has been reasonably consistent over time, while yellowfin CPUE has been high even during FAD closures.  The longline catch has seen relatively equal levels of bigeye, albacore and yellowfin catch, with recent decline in overall levels, but a strong increase in albacore in 2017. There are 2 components to the longline fishery: (i) the tropical longline fishery (20°N–10°S), with catches of bigeye and yellowfin, which recorded reasonably stable catch and effort over the last 10 years. Declines in catch and effort in 2017 may be an artefact of incomplete reporting; CPUE for both species spiked in 2014–2015, but has since returned to more normal levels; and (ii) the southern longline fishery, targeting South Pacific albacore, where catch and effort increased significantly in 2017; CPUE has declined over the long term, but has shown a small increase since 2011."
WCPFC15,160,"He provided an overview of stock status, noting that spawning biomass depletion was the metric for denoting stock status, and that there had been a long-term declining trend for all species. Three stocks are not near the 20% LRP, while yellowfin is starting to approach that LRP, which would need to be examined in future years; skipjack is trending close to the 50% interim TRP.  Regarding the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), he noted that the indicators suggest we are currently in a weak El Nino phase, and the median of the NOAA forecast models suggests that this is likely to continue through at least the first half of 2019. Projected climate change impacts show substantial declines predicted for skipjack as the 21st century progresses, and more modest declines for yellowfin and bigeye. South Pacific albacore is actually projected to increase, but with the caveat that there is very large uncertainty in these projections."
WCPFC15,161, In response to an inquiry from PNG regarding the increase in the number of skunk sets SPC stated it may be related to unassociated sets made by vessels in response to the FAD closures in effect since  29    2009 that were made in the absence of much experience in making such sets; he suggested the number of skunk sets may decrease as vessels gain experience.
WCPFC15,162,"Australia, on behalf of other FFA members, echoed the sentiments expressed by the Chair in relation to the enormous contribution of Dr John Hampton to the Commission and FFA members over many decades, and expressed their thanks. With respect to the presentation, they stated their understanding that the overview was for information but stated that FFA members wanted to draw attention to a number of larger issues raised in the report. These include the fact that the work of the Commission had been focused on bigeye tuna for several years, while currently the tropical tuna stock of most concern was yellowfin, meaning the Commission would need to broaden its focus. They stated that new work would likely need to be focused on better quantifying the catch of small yellowfin in the far west of the WCPFC Convention Area. They welcomed continuation of the WPEA project, and noted the work in progress on reducing uncertainty regarding yellowfin growth.  They stated that as long as there were major uncertainties about the status of tropical tuna stocks important to WCPFC CCMs, there could be no weakening of the tropical tuna measure."
WCPFC15,163,"Samoa, on behalf of FFA members, stated their concern over the South Pacific albacore stock status, and stated that the longline vulnerable albacore biomass is critical to the fishery."
WCPFC15,164,"The EU noted the value of the presentation on climate impacts despite the large uncertainty of the results. It stated that although all key tuna stocks were within safe biological limits, some other species were assessed with a different conservation status, and suggested that the presentation could include other WCPFC species (e.g., North Pacific bluefin tuna, North Pacific striped marlin), which would ensure that all species raising conservation concerns are adequately considered by the Commission. In response to a query from the EU regarding a decreasing trend in purse seine effort, SPC stated that the reduction was real (not an artefact of the data), and suggested the US treaty and departure of some fleets from fishery likely had an impact."
WCPFC15,165,"Indonesia asked what factors were driving the increase in South Pacific albacore effort. SPC replied there was some increase in fishing effort by the Chinese fleet, as well as an increase to the far east of the convention area, and around Vanuatu and Solomon Islands; much of the increase was in the high seas, with a spike in effort south of 10°S."
WCPFC15,166,"China inquired about the portion of the South Pacific albacore catch taken by the troll fishery, and whether SPC conducted the assessment for South Pacific albacore in conjunction with IATTC staff. SPC noted that chartering arrangements had altered over the previous 3 years, and that detailed information was presented in WCPFC15-2018-IP02: Trends in the south Pacific albacore longline and troll fisheries. The troll fishery accounts for a catch of some 2,000–3,000mt of albacore per year, much of this around New Zealand; the fish are usually 1–3 years old. Regarding cooperation with IATTC, SPC noted that the last few assessments had been restricted to the WCPFC Convention Area, including the overlap area, but not farther east. SPC stated this was done to provide more targeted advice to the Commission, but that it may be worth doing a Pacific-wide stock assessment, especially because IATTC indicates catches in the EPO may have increased in the last few years."
WCPFC15,167,"Chinese Taipei noted the climate change impacts on tuna stocks, which projected three species would be negatively impacted, while south Pacific albacore could be positively impacted, and asked about the impact of climate change on tuna migration patterns. SPC stated changes in stocks were a response to weakening of upwelling and currents that take that upwelling to the WPO, with a resulting displacement of stocks to the east. SPC noted there could be some increase (or greater stability) of bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack stocks in the EPO. South Pacific albacore are displaced somewhat to the south, and climate change impacts at 10°–30° S differ from those in equatorial waters, which is reflected  30    by the projected positive impact on these stocks. It noted there was large uncertainty in the climate change models with respect to changes in dissolved oxygen levels, to which South Pacific albacore are sensitive, and stressed that the projected 50% increase should not be considered reliable at present, noting the need for better resolution of the dissolved oxygen parameter."
WCPFC15,168,"In response to a query from New Zealand regarding trends in CPUE in the longline catch, SPC stated that yellowfin was a particularly important component in the southern longline fishery, and that it would need to look at this in the stock assessments. It noted that CPUE was relatively low in those areas, and that there were no striking differences in trends over time. SPC indicated it would examine the issue and report back to New Zealand."
WCPFC15,169,"Dr Shuya Nakatsuka (Japan), Vice-Chair of the Pacific bluefin tuna working group reviewed the status of Pacific bluefin tuna on behalf of the ISC, which is the science provider to the NC, and provided advice to SC. As the 2018 assessment was an update, the basic model construction was the same as that used for the 2016 assessment. Population dynamics were estimated using a fully integrated age-structured model (Stock Synthesis v. 3) fitted to catch, size-composition and CPUE data from 1952 to 2016 (fishing year). Life history parameters included a length-at-age relationship from otolith-derived ages, as well as natural mortality estimates from a tag-recapture study and empirical-life history methods. Nineteen fleets were defined for use in the stock assessment model based on a country/gear/season/region stratification. Quarterly observations of catch and size compositions, when available, were used as inputs to the model to describe the removal processes. Annual estimates of standardized CPUE from the Japanese longline fleets, the Chinese Taipei longline fleets, and the Japanese troll fleets were used as measures of the relative abundance of the population. Based on the diagnostic analyses, the ISC concluded that the model represents the data sufficiently and results were consistent with the 2016 assessment. He noted that ISC had previously assessed the stock to be at a historically low level, but that it was now gradually increasing, with a positive recruitment trend for the last 2 years. Fishing mortality is declining, presumably because of recently adopted conservation measures. The stock status assessment concluded overfishing is occurring and the stock is in an overfished condition based on commonly used reference points. The harvest strategy HS-02 (Harvest Strategy for Pacific Bluefin Tuna Fisheries) uses the low recruitment scenario until the initial rebuilding target is achieved and average recruitment thereafter, and it has been confirmed that the recent 10-year recruitment is better than that from the low recruitment period (1980–1989). The status quo projection resulted in a 98% probability of achieving the rebuilding target. In summary, the projection results indicate that the initial rebuilding target will be achieved. The 2018 results are more optimistic because of recent good recruitment. In its advice to the Commission, SC14 noted “the current very low level of spawning biomass (3.3% B0), the current level of overfishing, and that the projections are strongly influenced by the inclusion of a relatively high but uncertain recruitment in 2016. The majority of CCMs recommended a precautionary approach to the management of Pacific bluefin tuna, especially in relation to the timing of increasing catch levels, until the rebuilding of the stock to higher biomass levels is achieved.” (SC14 Summary Report, para 266)."
WCPFC15,170,"S. Nakatsuka further stated the North Pacific swordfish 2018 assessment used an integrated model, and stock status was relatively good, with projections undertaken in various scenarios; SC noted the results. For North Pacific albacore no assessment was done in 2018 (the last was in 2017), and SC advice from SC13 is current."
WCPFC15,171,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, stated it was aware of discussions regarding potential increases in catch limits. While very supportive of the harvest strategy approach, it stated it was also aware of the need for a precautionary approach and stated that catch increases should be considered only after continued positive developments.  31"
WCPFC15,172,"The EU welcomed the update on the Pacific bluefin tuna stocks, and the more positive outlook, while reminding members that the first rebuilding target was well below any biological reference points adopted for other stocks, and that there was a long way to go in rebuilding the stock. It inquired how uncertainty was addressed for Pacific bluefin tuna, in comparison to approaches used by SPC for tropical tuna species. In reply, the presenter stated that uncertainty is accounted for through variability in terms of catch rate and CPUE, and by using historical recruitment levels; in the initial rebuilding period the low recruitment period is used. Steepness is high but does not affect the future recruitment level in the projection. Japan noted that the approach taken by ISC for Pacific bluefin tuna was highly precautionary as the low recruitment period used (from the 1980s) was below recent recruitment. The presenter stated that SPC provides projections based both on recent recruitment and low recruitment levels for tropical tunas. That used for Pacific bluefin tuna was 30% lower than an average level, and thus assumes a recruitment reduction of 30%. The EU noted the need to keep in mind that tropical tuna species are 50%–100% above maximum sustainable yield levels, while Pacific bluefin is a depleted stock, and thus the management response needs to be proportionate.  6.2 South Pacific Albacore"
WCPFC15,173,The Commission was provided with WCPFC15-2018-08: Reference document for the review of CMM 2015-02 and development of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-06 (south Pacific albacore tuna).  6.2.1 Roadmap for effective conservation and management of South Pacific albacore
WCPFC15,174,"The Chair of the SPA-VIWG introduced WCPFC15-2018-SPalbroadmap:  Intersessional activity report from the South Pacific albacore roadmap virtual working group, and noted that WCPFC14 adopted terms of reference (TORs) for a South Pacific albacore working group. She noted that a formal review of the measure was not needed because issues with the CMM were well documented. She stated that WCPFC15-2018-SPalbroadmap_suppl: South Pacific Albacore Roadmap Previous SC, TCC, and Commission Discussions Regarding CMMs 2010-05 and 2015-02 compiled all comments since about 2010. A workplan was included as attachment 3 to WCPFC15-2018-SPalbroadmap and developing it would be the task for the SPA-VIWG over the next months. She stated that it was envisioned that a limit on the overall fishery should be in place as the harvest strategy was developed, with a TRP in place. The workplan contains three workstreams: the harvest strategy, addressing monitoring and reporting gaps, and establishing limits for the fishery. She also referenced WCPFC15-2018-09: Technical aspects of a potential south Pacific albacore harvest strategy (prepared by SPC) and noted that SC14 had recommended that WCPFC15 use the working paper to inform the development of the roadmap, and SC14 requested guidance from the Commission on the fisheries to be included, and the potential management control measures for that fishery."
WCPFC15,175," Vanuatu thanked New Zealand for leading the intersessional process, and stated it was glad to see agreement on the need for TRPs. It noted WCPFC14 agreed on the need to set a TRP at WCPFC15."
WCPFC15,176,China also thanked New Zealand and inquired whether the harvest control rule to be adopted by 2021 should also include a harvest allocation. It suggested that the Commission advises SPC that all fisheries should be controlled by a harvest control rule.
WCPFC15,177,"The EU stated in reference to WCPFC15-2018-09 that the focus on the WCPO (as opposed to the entire Pacific stock as is done in the North Pacific albacore stock assessment) could negatively impact the harvest strategy, observing there was a significant increase in albacore catch in the EPO (25,000 tons in recent years). It also raised the issue of the overlap area between the WCPFC and IATTC, where members can make their own decisions about how their catches are allocated. The EU spoke about  32    empirical and model-based approaches, and suggested these could be useful when used in conjunction, and asked whether current levels of longline observer coverage could impact the development of the proposed harvest strategy. New Zealand stated that the SPA-VIWG would not address which stocks were covered by the stock assessment, but acknowledged the concern, and that SC14 recommended both approaches be used. Observer coverage will help with data, and be beneficial in the long term, but how to do this remains a question. SPC stated that it formerly did a South Pacific-wide assessment, but then focused on the Convention area to tailor its specific evaluations. SPC noted the overlap area was included in the assessment. It stated that it could develop an estimate of implementation error using observer data from the Fiji fleet, where observer coverage is relatively good."
WCPFC15,178,China stated that it was premature to adopt an Electronic Reporting standard for South Pacific albacore at WCPFC15 and hoped that Electronic Reporting could be addressed at WCPFC16 in conjunction with a focus on transhipment.
WCPFC15,179,"The United States thanked New Zealand for spearheading the roadmap for South Pacific albacore.  It stated it was very concerned about the management of the fishery, as it is an important backbone to many island economies. It stated much work remained to be done to progress discussion on catch limits and allocation schemes and looked forward to continuing to participate in the IWG to move the roadmap process forward. The United States hoped the process can lead to economically viable fisheries, particularly for its longline fleet in American Samoa and its troll fishery."
WCPFC15,180,The Chair noted the need for a roadmap workplan at WCPFC16 and suggested the SPA-VIWG could reconvene later in 2019 to discuss SC15 and TCC15 outcomes. She noted the United States had suggested a focus on longline catch and effort while retaining some flexibility.
WCPFC15,181,"Cook Islands, on behalf of FFA members, stated that the management control rule that FFA members were likely to ask SPC to test in the Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) for the Harvest Control Rule is catch, although they noted this would be locally translated into national management control quantities for those FFA members that already use effort or other management controls on albacore fishing in their own jurisdictions. FFA would likely recommend to SPC that all fishing gears taking South Pacific albacore should be included as fisheries in the MSE, including the southern albacore troll fishery, while noting that future management action should be commensurate with the impact different gear types have on the stock.  They noted FFA members’ discussions were preliminary, with no decisions as of yet, and stated that as already agreed, WCPFC15 would adopt a TRP and then work would proceed in the Commission on determining catch and/or effort limits that will help us move towards the target."
WCPFC15,182,"WCPFC15 tasked the SPA-VIWG, Chaired by New Zealand, to continue work intersessionally to develop the Roadmap for Effective Conservation and Management of South Pacific Albacore.   6.2.2 Target reference point"
WCPFC15,183,"The Commission considered WCPFC15-2018-10_rev1: Potential target reference points for south Pacific albacore (prepared by SPC). Fiji, on behalf of FFA members, introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP10: Proposal for establishing a target reference point for south Pacific albacore, reminding members that WCPFC made a binding decision to adopt a TRP for South Pacific albacore at WCPFC15. They noted that each year FFA members gave a lengthy explanation of their TRP proposal, trying to anticipate and answer all questions, but that for every question they answer, a new question is raised, usually one that was answered the previous year. They posed the following question of other CCMs:  33    “What do you expect will be the likely result of taking no effective management action, and what impact this will have on South Pacific SIDS?”, stating that members likely know the answer, and FFA members are not prepared to let this happen. They noted their proposal was based on the best scientific advice and sought to start the Commission on the path towards effectively managing the stock in a way that would provide economic benefits to all participants. They thanked the CCMs that had engaged with them on the proposal and looked forward to the cooperation of all WCPFC members to ensure it is passed by WCPFC15."
WCPFC15,184,"China thanked FFA for the proposal, noting it had conducted bilateral discussions with FFA prior to WCPFC15. It noted that it supported the consensus at WCPFC14 to adopt a TRP, but stated FFA was now proposing a TRP based on 45% spawning biomass in the absence of fishing, and changing the concept through a focus on CPUE, and limiting the TRP to longline fisheries that target South Pacific albacore. China stated it would pursue the issue through bilateral contacts with FFA and would seek to reach a common understanding."
WCPFC15,185,"The Pacific Islands Tuna Industry Association (PITIA), on behalf of its members in the South Pacific albacore longline fishery, expressed deep concern that the WCPFC continues to fail in its mandate to respond effectively to dire conditions in the WCPO South Pacific albacore fishery.  It strongly encouraged WCPFC15 to come to agreement on the harvest strategy elements they committed to under the Harvest Strategy Workplan CMM 2014-06, including establishing a TRP and developing a Harvest Control Rule for South Pacific albacore. It stated that the most recent stock assessment for South Pacific albacore supports the conclusion that the southern albacore stock is not overfished or experiencing overfishing, but the fishery is in a perilous state.  Catch rates simply cannot support current costs, leaving many companies on the brink of financial failure. It stated it is fortunate that the southern albacore stocks are biologically healthy, but the key to economic viability of a fishery is CPUE.  It indicated it has observed a continually declining CPUE over several years, diminishing what was once a robust and attractive fishery to a shadow of itself, and said that the inability of the WCPFC to control a massive increase in high seas fishing effort is a sad indictment about this Commission’s ability to manage the fisheries under its charge. It stated WCPFC must take heed of the management advice and implications contained in recommendations from SC10 to SC14, noting the critical importance of the fishery for the fishing industry, their communities, their people and their livelihoods and well-being. PITIA strongly urged the WCPFC 15 to make a decision to ensure the long-term commercial viability and sustainability of the southern longline fishery."
WCPFC15,186,"Chinese Taipei thanked FFA and noted confusion over the figures. It stated its understanding that a TRP is a starting point, and that when a TRP is adopted the Commission would not take immediate action to reduce effort, but stated the need to know what the impact on effort would be in the future.  Chinese Taipei stated that South Pacific albacore has a healthy status.  It needed more time to understand a change to a CPUE-based TRP, and noted that such a change (as in WCPFC15-2018-10_rev1 and DP10) shall be reviewed by SC. Chinese Taipei also expressed that it would strive to work with other CCMs as there was agreement by CCMs last year to progress this matter this year."
WCPFC15,187,"Cook Islands, on behalf of FFA members, stated they envisage a bright future for distant water vessels partnering with FFA members to sustainably fish for South Pacific albacore in their EEZs, and also for developing their own domestic fleets, but stated all those vessels need to be able to catch enough fish to be profitable. They noted the absence of any benefit in a fishery that makes no profit, makes a profit only two years out of five, or requires long-term government funding and subsidisation to stay afloat. They stated that the only way that fishery managers can promote profitability is to manage the stock at a level that maintains good catch rates. South Pacific albacore is assessed as a healthy stock because the stock assessment shows that the total biomass is high, which may be accurate, but the longline fishery does not fish the total biomass, but rather large adult fish, what the SPC calls the  34    “vulnerable biomass”. There are far fewer fish in the vulnerable biomass than there are in the total biomass. So, as explained in DP10, FFA members propose that the Commission agree on a TRP that will restore and maintain the vulnerable biomass of the stock at 17% above its 2013 level in order to ensure economically viable catch rates in the future. This will set the stage for future work in the Commission, including the setting of limits that will apply in EEZs and in the high seas and the agreement of harvest control rules. They encouraged engagement from other CCMs on their proposal and stated that FFA members were not willing to leave WCPFC15 without agreement on a meaningful TRP for South Pacific albacore that will provide the basis for effective management of the stock by the WCPFC and ensure the economic viability of their fisheries for this important species."
WCPFC15,188,"The United States voiced support for a TRP for South Pacific albacore that ensures the profitability of Pacific Island fishing fleets, and tentatively supported FFA’s proposal. It noted it was very much in favour of adopting a TRP, but argued that this should be done through the harvest strategies, and not through CMMs, which are for binding actions on individual members."
WCPFC15,189,"Samoa suggested there are benefits for all with the TRP, stating that if all fish were caught now, no fish will be left for the future, including for distant water fishing nations’ future operations. Samoa noted that SIDS’ fisheries are not subsidized, and stated the need to ensure continuity of fishing."
WCPFC15,190,"American Samoa stated that the US market for canned albacore is the largest globally, and the American Samoa canneries are one of the major sources of canned albacore. It stated that American Samoa’s domestic longline fishery is almost entirely dependent on the South Pacific albacore stock, and has gone through great changes in the last ten years. In the early to mid-2000s, the fishery was profitable. In 2014, the economics of the fishery were so bad that it was better to tie up vessels in the fleet than to go fishing. Similar conditions were experienced in 2016 then, on average, every hook deployed by the fleet lost money. Several neighbouring domestic longline fleets have suffered similar economic conditions. It expressed the hope that WCPFC15 can adopt a TRP for South Pacific albacore that will lead to catch rates that restore profitability to domestic fisheries while maintaining adequate sources of albacore for processing, recognizing the importance of related impacts and vulnerabilities under Article 30 of the Convention. American Samoa looked forward to cooperating with other CCMs to address these important issues."
WCPFC15,191,"French Polynesia stated that it supported adoption of a TRP, which it sees as a first step to development of a harvest strategy."
WCPFC15,192,"China observed that in 2016 the Commission adopted a TRP for skipjack based on biomass in the absence of fishing. It stated that in its view a consistent approach should be taken in setting stock TRPs, and that they were confused regarding the suggested CPUE-based TRP for South Pacific albacore."
WCPFC15,193,"Vanuatu, on behalf of FFA members, stated that South Pacific albacore is the foundation of domestic longline fishery operations in many FFA member countries and many SIDS are taking steps to improve the management of the fishery within their own waters including through MSC certification. A target reference point for South Pacific albacore is a key first step in the development of harvest control rules, and without progress in this area MSC certification will lapse. This is yet another reason why the Commission needs to follow through on its management commitments this year and agree to the FFA’s TRP proposal."
WCPFC15,194,"Tonga stated that like other FFA member countries, South Pacific albacore is very important to Tonga. It noted that fish is its primary resource. It reflected on the development of Tonga’s fishing industry and contrasted the current risk of overfishing the Southern albacore stock. It highlighted the high seas IUU fishing adjacent to its waters, and the impacts of climate change, and stressed the  35    importance for sustainable management of these fisheries. It supported the proposal by FFA member countries, which they stated represents the best way to manage this resource, and stressed the importance of having a TRP approved by WCPFC15, which was being requested by 16 WCPFC members. Tonga sought the support of all member countries attending the meeting to ensure that the South Pacific albacore resource is managed sustainably."
WCPFC15,195,"EU stated that it is not directly involved in the fishery and could support the principle of a TRP that is based, in part, on economic factors. It expressed doubts about basing it solely on CPUE, but voiced support for the effort in principle. EU noted that SIDS were asking others to reduce their level of fishing effort to enable the fishing effort of SIDS. It acknowledged that some States are more vulnerable but there is also a socioeconomic impact on those who must reduce their effort. In the UN FSA, countries involved must cooperate. EU invited all those involved in the fishery to make a sacrifice."
WCPFC15,196,"New Caledonia stated that it is very dependent on South Pacific albacore, which accounts for 65% of their catch. It stated it has good catch rates in their EEZ, but that its fleet is suffering from the huge fishing effort in the high seas pockets around its EEZ. New Caledonia supported making progress on the issue."
WCPFC15,197,"Tuvalu supported other FFA members, noting that a CPUE-based approach has been proposed because this is what determines profit; it also noted that spawning biomass estimates are not as robust for this species as for other species. Tuvalu stated that the discussion was limited to a TRP, and that a later process would address catch levels."
WCPFC15,198,"Niue supported comments from FFA members and encouraged members to consider WCPFC15-2018-10_rev1, and consult with SPC."
WCPFC15,199,"Following further consultation, the SWG Chair (Fiji) thanked all CCMs for agreeing on a TRP number, which would be an interim TRP.  The SWG Chair acknowledged that FFA members had to give up a lot, but did so in the interest of moving forward and agreeing on a TRP. He stated this had been discussed for many years, and thanked the FFA Secretariat, SPC, and all delegations for their understanding and cooperation."
WCPFC15,200,"China stated that the 56% TRP for South Pacific albacore was a proposal from FFA, and in consideration to the wishes of FFA and the difficulty that the Chinese tuna industry has to face in the future, if there was consensus amongst other Members to adopt the proposed TRP, China would not block adoption of the TRP."
WCPFC15,201,"Japan thanked the SWG Chair and supported the proposed language. It stated that Japan catches a very small amount of South Pacific albacore but that it was active in the discussions because it understands the economic difficulties fishermen in FFA members face. It noted that WCPFC16 would look at skipjack, and that Japanese fishermen are facing economic problems because of changed migration patterns of skipjack. Japan hoped these considerations could be extended to the discussion on skipjack to be held in 2019."
WCPFC15,202,"Samoa, on behalf of FFA, felt very encouraged after the discussions with China and Japan. FFA and ministerial colleagues appreciated the support and concessions and thanked the EU and the United States for their support. They noted that at the ongoing climate change negotiations in Poland (COP 24), their Prime Minister spoke about the ocean and the need to preserve our resources, now and for the future, and stated that the obligations made today would go a long way to conserving our resources for the future. They thanked delegates, the WCPFC Secretariat, and the SWG Chair.   36"
WCPFC15,203,"Chinese Taipei thanked CCMs and noted that South Pacific albacore is a very important resource to their industry as well. It stated that it understood the importance of this step and said all CCMs must share the burden, which would require sacrifice on their part. Chinese Taipei expressed that it will not join the consensus, but it has no intention to block the adoption of the TRP, noting that there was consensus amongst other Members."
WCPFC15,204,"The Cook Islands thanked everyone for their hard work and stated that the stock could now be managed for the benefit of everyone, which sends a positive signal to the industry and to Pacific peoples."
WCPFC15,205,EU welcomed the compromise achieved. It noted there was a mention that there may be a need for stronger cooperation between the WCPFC and IATTC in relation to managing or working together for global assessment of South Pacific albacore in the EPO and WCPO.
WCPFC15,206,"The Chair reflected that the outcome reflected what was possible when all members cooperate, even if they all do not agree. She noted that the TRP for South Pacific albacore would be recorded in the harvest strategy section of the Commission webpage, not as a CMM."
WCPFC15,207,"WCPFC15 agreed on an interim target reference point (TRP) for south Pacific albacore at 56 percent of spawning stock biomass in the absence of fishing (0.56 SBF=0)1  with the objective of achieving an 8 percent increase in catch per unit of effort (CPUE) for the southern longline fishery as compared to 2013 levels.2 If a future stock assessment indicates that this interim TRP will not result in the desired longline CPUE, then the interim TRP will be revised in order to meet this objective. The TRP shall be reviewed every 3 years, consistent with the SP albacore assessment schedule."
WCPFC15,208,"The Commission shall amend or develop appropriate conservation and management measures to implement a harvest control rule, developed in accordance with CMM 2014-06, with the objective of maintaining the south Pacific albacore spawning stock biomass at the target level on average and according to the timeframes specified in paragraph"
WCPFC15,209," 209. In order to manage the required reduction in catches, the timeline for achieving the interim target reference point shall be no later than 20 years. The Scientific Services Provider is tasked with identifying a range of alternative catch pathways and timeframes that achieve this, for consideration in 2019."
WCPFC15,210,In undertaking the assessment identified in paragraph 209 information from all fisheries will be included while noting that any management measures must take account of the impact of different gear types.
WCPFC15,211,The Scientific Committee shall refer to the target reference point in its assessment of the status of the WCPO South Pacific albacore tuna stock and in reporting to the Commission on management advice and implications for this stock.
WCPFC15,212,"Considering that the distribution of the South Pacific albacore stock goes beyond the WCPFC Convention area and the management of this stock is responsibility of both WCPFC and IATTC, WCPFC15 requested the Scientific Services Provider to coordinate with the IATTC scientific staff with the view to consider including the entire South Pacific in future assessments.                                                       1 The method to be used in estimating the recent average spawning biomass in the absence of fishing shall be the same as that adopted by the Commission for the limit reference point, as described in paragraph 3 of CMM 2015-06. 2 The proxy for CPUE will be the southern longline vulnerable biomass as estimated within the stock assessment.  37    6.2.3 Harvest control rules"
WCPFC15,213,The Chair noted that the issue would be addressed through the future development of the workplan for the Roadmap for Effective Conservation and Management of South Pacific Albacore (Agenda Item 6.2.1). 6.2.4 Management strategy evaluation
WCPFC15,214,The Chair noted that the issue would be addressed through the future development of the workplan for the Roadmap for Effective Conservation and Management of South Pacific Albacore (Agenda Item 6.2.1). 6.2.5 Review of CMM 2015-02 (SP albacore)
WCPFC15,215,"Two papers were prepared relevant to this agenda item: WCPFC15-2018-IP03: Summary of CCM reporting under south Pacific albacore CMMs (Secretariat and SPC), and WCPFC15-2018-IP04_rev1: An assessment of the number of vessels fishing for south Pacific albacore south of 20°S (SPC). There was no discussion under this agenda item.  6.3 Bigeye, Skipjack and Yellowfin"
WCPFC15,216,"SPC introduced WCPFC15-2018-12_rev2: Evaluation of CMM 2017-01 for bigeye tuna, with additional evaluations for skipjack and yellowfin tuna. The 2018 Harvest Strategy work plan, as updated by WCPFC14, requested that “SC and SPC provide advice to the Commission on the likely outcomes of the revised tropical tuna measure” (CMM 2017-01) against its aim for bigeye that “the spawning biomass depletion ratio (SB/SBF=0) be maintained at or above the average SB/SBF=0 for 2012-2015”. SPC used the same detailed evaluation approach as used within previous tropical tuna CMM evaluations. Assumptions are made regarding the impact that changes to the FAD closure period and/or high seas effort limits will have on FAD-related effort, and the potential future catches of longline fleets. Under these assumptions, three scenarios of future purse seine effort and longline catch are defined: (i) ‘status quo’ (2013–2015 average fishing levels); (ii) ‘optimistic’ (e.g. CCMs with longline limits take their 2017 catch limit or 2013–2015 average level if lower); and (iii) ‘pessimistic’ (every CCM fishes the maximum allowed under the Measure)."
WCPFC15,217,"Stochastic bigeye stock projections were used to evaluate potential long-term consequences of resulting future fishing levels under each scenario, in comparison to status quo conditions (2013–2015 average), across the 2017 bigeye assessment grid incorporating updated growth information, weighted as defined by SC13 for management advice. SPC noted that the results were strongly influenced by the assumed future recruitment levels. If recent positive recruitments continue into the future, all scenarios examined achieve the aims of the CMM, in that median spawning biomass is projected to increase relative to recent levels, and median fishing mortality is projected to decline (exception being the pessimistic CMM scenario, although fishing mortality remains below FMSY). If less optimistic longer-term recruitments continue into the future, spawning biomass depletion worsens relative to recent levels under all scenarios, and the future risk of spawning biomass falling below the limit reference point (LRP) increases to 24%–40%, dependent on the scenario. In turn, all three future fishing scenarios imply notable increases in fishing mortality under those recruitment conditions, to median levels well above FMSY."
WCPFC15,218,"The analysis for skipjack and yellowfin was consistent with that for bigeye and made the following assumptions: overall purse seine effort is constant at the 2013–2015 average level; yellowfin longline catch is consistent with that assumed for bigeye, and skipjack longline catch is negligible. Long term  38    recruitment is assumed. For skipjack, all scenarios result in SB/SBF=0 of .47, with 0% chance of being below the TRP. For yellowfin  SB/SBF=0 is .33 for the 2013–2015 average and optimistic scenarios (with a 7% risk of breaching the LRP); SB/SBF=0 is .30 for the  pessimistic scenario, with a 16% risk of breaching the LRP. With respect to whether the CMM will achieve its objective skipjack: reasonably (SB/SBF=0 ~0.47), while yellowfin is marginal, given risk, and notably not under the pessimistic scenario (8% reduction in SB/SBF=0 from recent levels, 16% risk of breaching the LRP)."
WCPFC15,219,"  In response to a query from Korea, SPC clarified that 2012-2015 was used in calculating SB/SBF=0, while comparisons were based on the 2013-2015 period."
WCPFC15,220,"Solomon Islands, on behalf of the PNA, thanked SPC for the excellent work and for including skipjack and yellowfin in WCPFC15-2018-12_rev 2. They stated that given the latest stock assessments, there was no longer a need to focus solely on bigeye and so having information available on all three species is vital, and the main messages that PNA take from the projections are: • For bigeye, the measure is likely to achieve its objectives of stable spawning biomass, but there is certainly no room for increases in bigeye catch or effort. • For yellowfin, the results are far less positive, and spawning biomass is likely to fall below recent levels in the long term.  Of even greater concern is the introduction of reasonably high levels of risk that the stock will actually fall below the limit reference point. • For skipjack, the projections show that spawning biomass in 2045 will likely be marginally less than the target reference point. Solomon Islands surmised that the yellowfin and skipjack messages are concerning to PNA as these are the mainstays of PNA economies.  They noted PNA countries would need time to explore the full implications, including the new skipjack assessment in 2019, but that at present the projections in combination provided irrefutable support for the FFA position in WCPFC15-2018-DP08 that any weakening of CMM 2017-01 would be inconsistent with the objectives of that measure and the precautionary approach."
WCPFC15,221,"Indonesia referenced the tables in Appendix 1 of WCPFC15-2018-12_rev 2 that relate to the estimation of the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios and inquired how decisions were made regarding these scenarios. It noted that Indonesia was making these comments in light of its views on bigeye tuna longline catch limits, as set forth in WCPFC15-2018-DP29: Indonesia’s bigeye tuna catch limits in longline fisheries."
WCPFC15,222,"The EU stated its understanding that the pessimistic scenario assumed that bigeye catch was maintained at a high level although biomass is decreasing, resulting in a very high level of effort, and questioned whether this was realistic. In response, SPC confirmed that the assumption that catch levels were maintained in the future (over the long term) was likely to result in overly high fishing mortality estimates. The EU also noted it would be desirable to present in the tables the outcome of projections over shorter time periods, as was done at SC and that in the future short-term projections are used instead or at least in addition to the long term ones, since the fisheries concerned are assessed quasi-every three years. Regarding management objectives and follow-up on recommendations of SC, the EU stated that in CMM 2017-01 the management objectives in the CMM were based on SC13 advice, which was precautionary because of uncertainty regarding the growth curve. SC14 adopted the growth curve, but advice from SC14 remains the same as it was in 2017 from SC13. EU indicated it would like a rationale for that advice from SC, and would like advice to be more explicit, including when possible different options for the Commission to consider.   39"
WCPFC15,223,"Japan inquired regarding skipjack, and the future projection for 2045, which projects SB2045/SBf=0 will be 47%, or close to 50%. It noted that if the goal is to maintain the ratio at 50%, this result is close, but inquired what the threshold would be at which it could be considered that the spawning biomass was being maintained “at around 50%”. Japan noted that depending on the specifics, the Commission would likely want to recommend some deviation centred around 50% and asked how great that would be. SPC agreed there was a need to develop a definition of what “around an average” means (how close over time?). Japan stated this would have to be discussed under the harvest strategy."
WCPFC15,224,"Indonesia inquired whether TRP or LRP was the most important for determining the health of the bigeye stock. SPC noted this would be addressed in the discussion on TRPs.  6.3.1 Review of CMM 2017-01 (bigeye, skipjack, yellowfin)"
WCPFC15,225,"The Chair noted that a number of reference documents were prepared for WCPFC15, including WCPFC15-2018-11: Reference document for the review of CMM 2017-01 and development of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-06 (bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna); WCPFC15-2018-IP05: Summary of the reports received under tropical tuna CMMs - from 2017 to 2018 (update of TCC14-IP07); WCPFC15-2018-IP06: Catch and effort tables on tropical tuna CMMs - prepared by SPC-OFP (update of TCC14-IP08); and WCPFC15-2018-IP11: Summary of Notifications to WCPFC of Charter, Lease or other mechanisms.  The Report of the FAD Management Options Intersessional Working Group (WCPFC15-2018-FADMO-IWG) and the various delegation proposals were noted to be relevant to the discussions and were considered by the tropical tuna CMM SWG.  She noted that CMM 2017-01 had five provisions that were expiring in 2018. One, relating to the Cook Islands did not need to be considered for extension. The others were considered under this agenda item. 6.3.1.a Para 19 of CMM 2017-01"
WCPFC15,226,"The EU introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP01: Proposal for amending CMM 2017-01 for the use of non-entangling FADs in WCPFC fisheries, which proposes amendments to 2017-01 specifying that FADs to be deployed in the Convention Area be built using non-entangling materials, with a view to decreasing entanglement of sharks, sea turtles and other species. It also directs SC and TCC to work to develop biodegradable FAD designs by 2020. In response to a query from Korea regarding the impacts on catch of target species through the use of non-entangling FADs, the EU stated that its fleet was already using the designs in other fisheries, and its research revealed there was no impact. Responding to a question from Japan on the inclusion of biodegradable FADs in the proposal, the EU clarified that in its proposed text, biodegradable FADs were not considered but its inclusion was, in fact, suggested in a paper submitted by FFA, which could be supported by the EU and incorporated in the final text if all members agree."
WCPFC15,227,"Following discussion in the margins of WCPFC15, the EU reviewed proposed changes to their proposal. As a compromise the updated proposal introduced, as a first step, the low risk entangling FADs.  During the ensuing discussion France underlined the importance of adapting the best available standards for FADs, the need for WCPFC to contribute to the Kobe Process joint working group on FADs, and congratulated SPC for its work in monitoring drifting FADs in the Pacific. FSM stated that the PNA were moving to adopt a requirement for fully non-entangling FADS that will apply in all PNA EEZs in the future."
WCPFC15,228,"Members discussed the desirability and difficulties of applying the measure to drifting FADs, and the Chair noted that the measure applied only to WCPFC CCMs. Some CCMs highlighted the importance of addressing drifting FADs, and of ensuring fleets operating within the WCPFC  40    Convention Area complied with the standards set by the Commission, while the United States raised the potential compliance difficulties faced by its vessels fishing in both the WCPFC Convention Area and the adjacent IATTC waters."
WCPFC15,229,"Following further consultation, the United States observed that the language as proposed was sufficiently similar to that used by the IATTC to enable its vessels to comply with the requirements of both RFMOs, and supported the measure on that basis, while noting that if changes were made by IATTC to its FAD standards it would want to revisit this section of the measure to ensure continued compatibility."
WCPFC15,230,The Commission agreed to language for paras. 19–22 of CMM 2018-01.  6.3.1.b Para. 28 allocation process
WCPFC15,231,"The Chair referred to the text of para. 28 of CMM 2017-01: “The limits set out in Attachment 1, Table 2 do not confer the allocation of rights to any CCM and are without prejudice to future decisions of the Commission. By 2019 the Commission shall agree on hard effort or catch limits in the high seas of the Convention Area and a framework for the allocation of those limits in the high seas amongst all Members and Participating Territories that adequately take into account Articles 8, 10 (3) and 30 of the Convention. The Commission shall also consider options as to how CCMs would use their limits”, and noted the need to determine a process for allocations to take place, and enable considerations at WCPFC16. She asked members for proposals including on how the Commission could start discussions in early 2019."
WCPFC15,232,"Korea stated that the high seas fish effort needed to be adjusted in accordance with Convention Article 8 (Compatibility of Conservation and Management Measures). It noted the need for sufficient time for discussions, and stated that the limits set forth in CMM 2017-01 Attachment 1, Table 2 do not confer any rights to CCMs, and that there was therefore a need to start our discussions without any assumptions. Korea suggested the need for a special session to address allocations in early 2019."
WCPFC15,233,"Solomon Islands, on behalf of FFA members, stated that workshops should be undertaken to determine high seas allocations, and referenced the discussion in WCPFC15-2018-DP09: Views on Paragraphs 28 and 44 of CMM 2017-01. They emphasized the need for preliminary discussions in advance of WCPFC16."
WCPFC15,234,Kiribati noted it would participate in any work referred under para 28.
WCPFC15,235,"The EU stated that discussion on allocation needed a comprehensive approach, and that conversations regarding the high seas needed to also address allocation in EEZs. It noted both needed to be taken into account, and such an approach was in the spirit of cooperation and followed provisions of UNCLOS and the UN FSA; to address the high seas without considering the EEZs would be discriminatory and neglecting the large majority of tropical tuna fisheries."
WCPFC15,236,Niue noted that WCPFC15 had made important progress in addressing conservation and management of the fisheries. It noted that implementation of para. 28 must build a framework for the need to adequately take into account artisanal fisheries and stated that WCPFC needed to set aside sufficient time for needed discussions.
WCPFC15,237,"The Chair stated that Korea suggested a workshop be held in early 2019, and that a discussion on funding had not been held by FAC and might not be possible given the schedule. The workshop duration would need to be 1–2 days. She noted that the wording in para. 28 and work agreed to be done in 2019  41    was specific. If a standalone meeting was to be held in 2019, funding (possibly external) would be needed. She observed that in the past requests had been made to the Executive Director to explore options, but the meeting would in that case be contingent on securing funding. She agreed it was hard to think about planning another meeting but stated that if work did not begin before WCPFC16, there would be a delay in meeting the timeframes in para 28 of CMM 2017-01. The Chair suggested that WCPFC15 agree that the Commission hold a two-day meeting in early 2019, pending availability of funds, and the Executive Director is tasked to explore funding options and communicate with members intersessionally."
WCPFC15,238,"Japan stated that it could support the proposed meeting schedule and having it dependent on the availability of funds, but noted the need to determine the TORs, and observed the need to address the comment from the EU. Japan agreed with the need for the Commission to discuss para. 28, but stated there had to be a clear mandate in writing."
WCPFC15,239,"The Chair agreed that clear directions would be needed and stated she would work with the Executive Director to develop brief TORs, taking into account the comments raised. The WCPFC Vice-Chair subsequently presented draft TORs for a workshop for the framework for allocation for review, noting the objectives were drawn from para. 28 of CMM 2017-01. The Chair invited comments noting the proposal was to have a 2-day stand-alone workshop, dependent on availability of funds."
WCPFC15,240,"Japan noted that IOTC and IATTC were addressing allocation, but that their approaches were similar to Article 10 of the Convention and did not have a true allocation framework. The EU noted that its previous intervention on this point and stated that it could not address high seas without looking at the situation in the EEZs. The EU noted there was an obligation for members fishing in high seas and coastal States to cooperate in order to ensure effective conservation and management of the stocks, and this should be reflected in the tasks or background of the TORs."
WCPFC15,241,"Tuvalu expressed a preference to retain wording that focussed on holding a workshop on high seas allocation. RMI agreed with Tuvalu regarding the workshop focus and saw no need to consider processes of other tuna RFMOs. It stated that the workshop would not have a real outcome they could foresee, noting that limits are already in place, and that some members were seeking to reinvent the situation."
WCPFC15,242,"During the ensuing discussion, members reiterated their positions, with some advocating for consideration of stocks throughout their range, and others seeking to limit the focus to setting high seas catch and effort limits. Japan indicated that it would be conducting bilateral discussions with the PNA and FFA members in 2019, and with the EU and the United States. Japan expressed its willingness to visit any members in the Pacific to have discussions, but not to hold a workshop. It encouraged other members to undertake such direct consultations, which it felt would facilitate the discussions. Indonesia stated its view that it was mandatory to have a workshop, noting that a discussion of the allocation framework would accommodate all these issues raised, including the relationship between high seas and EEZ allocations."
WCPFC15,243,"The Chair stated that in the absence of an agreement on the task a workshop was unlikely to be productive, and suggested members consider updating para. 28 of the measure with a new target date of 2020. Korea and RMI expressed support for this suggestion and there were no views to the contrary.  6.3.1.c FAD definition"
WCPFC15,244,"The United States introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP03: Proposal for a definition of fish aggregating device, noting that the existing definition of FAD was overly broad, as it includes natural objects of any  42    size, and spoke of the need to adopt a definition of FAD that can be used in all of the Commission’s work. It noted that the FAD management options IWG had been working on FAD designs and materials, and in its third meeting proposed minimum guidelines for FADs. The United States proposed to modify the definition of FAD so as to focus on FADs of interest from the standpoint of management and noted the benefits of aligning the WCPFC definition of FADs with the IATTC definition. The United States noted that Korea had a very similar proposal, and suggested it be discussed in the tropical tuna CMM SWG. The EU noted that the proposed definition mentioned only “objects deployed and/or tracked by vessels, …. for purse-seine fishing operations” and noted that FADs are also used with other fishing gear."
WCPFC15,245,"Korea introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP17: Proposed changes to conservation and management measure 2009-02 on the application of high seas FAD closures and catch retention, noting its proposal was similar to that of the United States. Korea noted it had been almost 10 years since the current definition of FAD was adopted by the WCPFC, that improvements had been made in CMMs over this period, and that the current definition was overly broad."
WCPFC15,246,"Following further consideration of the two proposals by members in a SWG, Korea produced new proposed text in consultation with CCMs for inclusion in the FAD closure definition, which comprised a list of materials that should not be considered as FADs in the context of the FAD closure measure."
WCPFC15,247,"RMI thanked Korea for the proposed language, agreed in principle on the need to examine the issue, and suggested this be looked at in 2019. It noted there were some merits to the proposed list, but that some elements might require further assessment. RMI stated it was prepared to work with Korea and other members, and possibly examine the definition of FADs in 2019, including in the context of PNA FAD tracking."
WCPFC15,248,The United States reminded members that two proposals had been submitted on the issue and stated it had been involved with Korea in the discussions and would like to see progress at WCPFC15.
WCPFC15,249,"Japan thanked Korea for its efforts and expressed support for improving the definition of FADs, but raised the need to look at possible negative effects of changing the definition, and specifically about the potential impact of excluding logs; it suggested the need to look at the entire CMM with respect to the FAD definition, which could have a negative effect on tuna stocks, particularly on bigeye. New Zealand and Cook Islands supported the views expressed by RMI and Japan. Tuvalu also expressed concern regarding log sets and the impact on bigeye stocks. Tuvalu agreed to the issue of vessels setting on FADs when they assume they were setting on a free school should be addressed, but stated it was not yet prepared to develop a new definition. Its position was supported by FSM."
WCPFC15,250,"Following further consultations in the margins, Nauru, on behalf of the PNA, provided new language for consideration: “In applying the provisions of paragraphs 16 and 17, any set where small amounts of plastic or small garbage that do not have a tracking buoy attached are detected shall not be considered to be a FAD set for the purposes of the FAD closure.  This shall apply in 2019 only and will be reviewed to determine whether it resulted in increased catch of bigeye and small yellowfin tuna.”"
WCPFC15,251,"The WTPO reinforced its position statements made at WCPFC13 and WCPFC14, which called on the Commission to consider and adopt a more specific and enforceable FAD definition measure. The WTPO proposed defining FAD to mean “anchored, drifting, floating or submerged objects deployed and/or tracked by vessels, including through the use of radio and/or satellite buoys, for the purpose of aggregating target tuna species for purse-seine fishing operations.” It noted that using such a definition could help alleviate legal issues and penalties currently faced by vessels for making what they perceive to be unassociated sets.   43"
WCPFC15,252,"The United States thanked Korea, the PNA and others who contributed to the compromise. It noted that, as expressed by other CCMs, at times its vessel captains claimed to have trouble with FAD requirements, because they establish a set around small natural objects they might not be able to see. It noted the proposal was a one-year measure and hoped that the items Korea listed in its proposal could be considered further in 2019."
WCPFC15,253,Japan thanked all CCMs involved and noted for the record that chopsticks were included in the definition of “small garbage”.
WCPFC15,254,"New Zealand stated its reservations about changing the definition, while recognizing the compliance issues raised by other CCMs, and appreciated the efforts to develop a compromise solution. It inquired how it could it be determined if the revised definition would result in increased catch. In response to a suggestion from Indonesia to broaden the applicability to all tropical tunas, from bigeye and yellowfin, it noted that FAD closures are technical measures intended to address the catch of small bigeye and yellowfin and preferred retaining that focus. RMI stated that the issue of assessing changes in catch was not considered by the SWG. In response to a question from Australia, SPC noted that in the absence of a clear definition of what “small amounts of plastic” or “small garbage” represents, data currently collected by observers do not allow straightforward identification of this set type. Hence an assessment of whether the change in the FAD set definition results in an increase in catches of bigeye tuna is difficult.  While in the future observers could potentially provide data to assess catch changes, it would require a change to logbook instructions, specific instructions for observers, and clear definitions.   6.3.1.d Expiry of paras. 16, 17, 29, 39 and 56 of CMM 2017-01"
WCPFC15,255,"Members held a discussion regarding expiry of paras. 16, 17, 29, 39 and 56 of CMM 2017-01. The United States thanked the Commission for considering the needs of American Samoa, as addressed by para. 29 of CMM 2017-01. It noted that the territory faces a number of unique challenges and has aspirational and developmental goals but was unable to take advantage of the measures put in place to protect SIDS. The United States noted that one cannery was closed, and another closed temporarily, and that the United States had closed the high seas to its boats on multiple occasions. It noted its strong support for transparent universal measures, stating it would favour a 4-month FAD closure, if other CCMs would agree on this as a potential compromise."
WCPFC15,256,"Tokelau noted the proposal for a 4-month FAD closure as an alternative to para. 17 of CMM 2017-01was being made very late, had been examined at WCPFC14, and did not have its support. Cook Islands supported the position expressed by Tokelau. The United States noted the lack of consensus on a core compromise and stated that it remained concerned that para. 17 has a low conservation value, but stated it would allow it to continue for the 2-year duration of the measure."
WCPFC15,257,"Korea thanked CCMs for their efforts on the issue. It noted that some work remained to refine the definition of FADs, and welcomed the opportunity to work further with CCMs and PNA CCMs in 2019, in conjunction with work on the FAD tracking system. Kiribati thanked the United States and Korea for their efforts to develop a compromise."
WCPFC15,258,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2018-01 Conservation and Management Measure for Bigeye, Yellowfin and Skipjack Tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Attachment G)    44    6.3.1.e FAD management options-IWG report"
WCPFC15,259,The Commission adopted the report of the FAD Management Options Intersessional Working Group (WCPFC15-2018-FADMO-IWG03).    6.3.2 Target reference point (bigeye and yellowfin)
WCPFC15,260,"J. Hampton (SPC) introduced WCPFC15-2018-13_rev1: Minimum TRPs for WCPO yellowfin and bigeye tuna consistent with alternative LRP risk levels. He noted that SC14 reviewed information on what would be the minimum setting for a candidate spawning-biomass depletion-based TRP for yellowfin tuna that avoids breaching the agreed LRP with a specified level of probability under the current uncertainty framework (SC14-MI-WP-01). While SC14 noted that the main biological consideration for a TRP is that it should be sufficiently above the LRP, SC14 also noted that the choice of a TRP can be based on a combination of biological, ecological and socio-economic considerations. SC14 recommended that the analyses be repeated for bigeye tuna taking account of the updated 2018 bigeye stock assessment, and with both ‘recent’ and ‘long term’ recruitment assumptions. The additional bigeye analyses are contained within WCPFC15-2018-13_rev1, which updates SC14-MI-WP-01. SPC computed median levels of spawning biomass depletion (SB/SBF=0) that are consistent with specified risk levels of breaching the limit reference point (LRP) of 0.2SBF=0. The analysis used:  • the structural uncertainty grid of models used by SC13 for advice from the 2017 yellowfin tuna assessment, and  • the structural uncertainty grid containing only ‘updated new growth’ models used by SC14 as the basis for advice from the 2018 update bigeye tuna assessment, under both the ‘recent’ and ‘long term’ assumptions for future bigeye recruitment, to generate 30-year projections that included stochastic variability in future recruitment under a variety of fishing levels scaled to the 2013–2015 averages."
WCPFC15,261,The main results are summarised in Table 1.  Table 1: Median levels of SB2045/SBF=0 for the four nominated levels of risk of breaching the LRP. Risk level Yellowfin tuna Bigeye tuna   ‘Recent’ recruitment ‘Long-term’ recruitment 5% 0.36 0.33 0.38 10% 0.34 0.30 0.34 15% 0.31 0.29 0.32 20% 0.29 0.28 0.29
WCPFC15,262,"These are values of SB/SBF=0 that, if achieved on average, are predicted to result in the specified levels of risk of breaching the LRP, and thus may be interpreted as minimum levels of SB/SBF=0 consistent with those risk levels, under the current uncertainty framework. SC14 recommended that WCPFC15 take note of these results in consideration of management objectives upon which any candidate TRPs for yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna should be based, and in so doing clarify the management objectives for these species (including the selection of risk levels) so that additional work identified by SC14 can be undertaken.  45"
WCPFC15,263,Japan agreed that TRPs should be based on both biological and socioeconomic factors. It noted that a paper prepared for SC14 that addressed economic projections suggested the economic index of the longline fishery was declining but would increase for the purse seine fishery. Japan noted this needed to be considered when seeking to balance different gear types.
WCPFC15,264,"In response to a query from Indonesia, SPC stated that the 2018 bigeye stock assessment update showed a long-term increase in the spawning biomass ratio, but that that this did not really influence the current work. It noted the numbers represented minimum targets, and constituted a buffer from the LRP, with specified levels of risk. There are many other issues to consider, including economic aspects and ecological effects, and various parties may have differing views on what is important. SPC noted that rationalizing these issues is a focus of the harvest strategy work now underway."
WCPFC15,265,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members, introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP08: Views of tropical tuna CMM, setting out their broad management objectives for bigeye and yellowfin under the tropical tuna measure, and to be taken into account in considering TRPs for the stocks. The objectives are (i) to maintain the stocks above levels where there is a very low risk of breaching the LRP consistent with the guidelines in the UN FSA; and (ii) achieve modest increases to SB/SBF=0 compared to recent levels in order to support ongoing economic management of the purse seine fishery and facilitate development opportunities for SIDS longline fisheries. They noted the Commission was beginning a discussion that should result in a decision on TRPs in 2019. They noted their preferred objectives for the TRP-setting process and continuation of the current measure through 2019. They noted their objection to weakening of the measure."
WCPFC15,266,New Zealand supported the statement by Tonga regarding FFA members’ objectives.
WCPFC15,267,"The EU broadly agreed with observations made by SPC and SC, noting that if stocks remained within safe biological limits, TRPs could be adjusted based on other criteria. It questioned however the pertinence of a precautionary TRP based on a very low probability of breaching a very conservative LRP that is not species specific. It reiterated that the LRP of 0.2SBF=0originated with work on demersal species that are far less resilient than tuna stocks, and suggested that species specific LRPs should be developed that take into account the key biological features of the tuna stocks being managed by WCPFC. It indicated that the LRP of 0.2SBF=0 could not be considered a biological reference point.  It reminded that the LRP was decided before the Harvest Strategies concept is developed and that in the light of the new approach all the key elements of a Harvest Strategy should be open for discussion.  It also observed that development of TRPs for multi-gear fisheries could not be based on a species-specific approach, in the sense that it might not be possible to achieve simultaneously precautionary TRPs for all the key species in such a complex fishery. EU suggested testing the TRP adopted for skipjack, monitoring the trajectory of other key species and based on this experience consider appropriate and realistic TRPs for other species. SPC stated that Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) found 20% was an appropriate LRP for productive stocks; less productive stocks would have LRPs of 30%–40%, but most species were fairly resilient. SPC noted the difficulty in discriminating in terms of resilience across species that are fairly closely related from an evolutionary standpoint. SPC indicated the Commission had taken heed of the precautionary approach in choosing an LRP 20%, and that much thought had been given to this."
WCPFC15,268,"FSM, on behalf of the PNA, supported the FFA position in WCPFC15-2018-DP08 as outlined by Tonga, stating that the proposed objectives for bigeye and yellowfin are relatively consistent with the objectives of CMM 2017-01 but also seek to ensure biological safety through reference to the LRP and to allow for consideration of increases to SB/SBF=0 levels. They noted that these proposals were put forward as a starting point for discussions, but that much work was needed before these could be converted into candidate TRPs, including defining what “very low risk” and “modest increases” mean  46    for short or medium-term management measures. They looked forward to hearing from other CCMs on their objectives for these stocks, and for the fisheries they support."
WCPFC15,269," Japan stated, with respect to bigeye and the review of CMM 2017-01, that following adoption of CMM 2008-01, Japan has implemented all tuna measures faithfully, scrapped many vessels, and seen a large decline in catch, with a large reduction in purse seine FADs sets. Japan noted that despite these efforts the situation with respect to bigeye and skipjack was worsening in waters around Japan, with serious impacts on Japanese fishermen, particularly coastal small-scale fishermen, including their catches and cultural activities centred around tuna species. Japan also highlighted that SC14 noted there was a high risk of breaching LRP and zero probability of achieving the objective of CMM2017-01 under the long-term average recruitment scenario. Japan stated that it opposed any weakening of tropical tuna CMMs at WCPFC15."
WCPFC15,270,"Pew, on behalf of Pew, WWF, Sustainable Fisheries Partnership, IPNLF, ISSF, and EDF, urged the Commission not to weaken the overall impact of management measures in the tropical tuna bridging measure. They observed that WCPFC members have agreed to apply the precautionary approach and stated that the Commission should not agree to a measure that does not meet the scientific advice to maintain bigeye and yellowfin fishing mortality. They noted the somewhat improved bigeye tuna stock status and stated the challenge for the Commission is to maintain this status. Given the high levels of uncertainty with respect to the long-term scenarios for the stock under the current management arrangements, they urged the Commission not to increase fishing mortality, but instead to use this opportunity to carefully consider developing management objectives for the stocks and accelerate development of a long-term harvest strategy for bigeye and yellowfin. They also noted the agenda items with respect to FADs, and urged the Commission to also follow the scientific advice to improve the sustainability of the FAD fishery by adopting science-based limits on FAD deployments and/or FAD sets, and adopting a binding requirement to use FAD designs that minimize or prevent the risk of entanglement, with a clear timeframe to transition to the use of biodegradable materials as soon as possible."
WCPFC15,271,"The Chair stated that review of the measure would continue in a SWG. She referenced WCPFC15-2018-DP29: Indonesia’s bigeye tuna catch limits in longline fisheries, which reflects Indonesia’s views. She noted the Commission had not yet conducted a thorough review of WCPFC fisheries and management objectives."
WCPFC15,272,The outcome of discussions on the tropical tuna measure are under Agenda Item 6.3.1 (see above).  6.3.3 Harvest control rules (skipjack)
WCPFC15,273,There was no discussion under this agenda item.  6.4 Pacific bluefin tuna 6.4.1 Review of CMM 2017-08
WCPFC15,274,"The following reference documents were prepared on this agenda item: WCPFC15-2018-16: Reference document for review of CMM 2017-08 and for the development of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-06 (Pacific bluefin tuna), and WCPFC15-2018-IP07: Compiled information on Pacific bluefin tuna fishing effort and catch (TCC14-2018-IP12_rev1).   47"
WCPFC15,275,"Japan introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP25: Proposal for amending Conservation and Management Measure for Pacific bluefin tuna (CMM2017-08), which was previously submitted to NC14. It noted a lack of consensus among CCMs at NC14 regarding an increase in catch limits.  It stated that at the special session of NC held in the margins of the meeting, consensus was reached on a change to the existing CMM (reflected in DP25) that allows a CCM to carry forward the under catch of a catch limit up to 5% of its initial catch limit, to provide some flexibility regarding catch limits. The same measure was adopted by IATTC earlier in 2018."
WCPFC15,276,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the NC Chair, and stated they had no objections to the proposal. The EU noted the presentation on the stock status indicated the condition was poor, and felt the flexibility was not proportional to the stock status. The NC Chair stated that if CCMs could not accept the current draft, it must be returned to NC for its consideration."
WCPFC15,277,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2018-02 Conservation and Management Measure for Pacific Bluefin tuna, which will replace CMM 2017-08 (Attachment H).     6.5 North Pacific albacore  6.5.1 Review of CMM-2005-03"
WCPFC15,278,The Chair noted two relevant documents — WCPFC15-2018-17: Reference document for review of CMM 2005-03 and development of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-06 (North Pacific albacore) and WCPFC15-2018-IP08: Updated information on North Pacific albacore effort data (TCC14-2018-IP11) — and the stock assessment update provided under Agenda Item 6.1.  6.6 North Pacific striped marlin
WCPFC15,279,The WCPFC Secretariat prepared WCPFC15-2018-18: Reference document for the scientific information and development of harvest strategies for North Pacific striped marlin (Kajikia audax) for consideration by the Commission. 6.6.1 Designation as a Northern stock and rebuilding plan
WCPFC15,280,"The Chair noted that the issue of designation of North Pacific striped marlin and formulation of a rebuilding plan had been before the Commission for several years. WCPFC14 tasked SC14 to provide advice, which it did in the form of proposed criteria that could be used to determine whether this could be designated as a northern stock. A recommendation was made previously for the Commission to adopt a rebuilding plan for the stock, but that has not occurred."
WCPFC15,281,"The United States confirmed that the issue was a longstanding one but stated that SC14 had provided the needed information. It stated that it did not believe the language in the Convention is vague, but agreed that it could be helpful to formalize the process for designating a “northern stock”. The NC’s purview is stocks that occur mostly north of 20°N, and the United States stated the criteria should be based on where the majority (or greater than 50%) of the stock occurs. The first criteria suggested by SC14 to consider is the proportion of total biomass of the stock occurring north of 20°N;  if information is available to suggest that the total biomass of the stock occurring north of 20°N is greater than 50%, then the United States believes that the stock should be designated as a northern stock. For North Pacific striped marlin, the information provided by SC indicates that the proportion of the biomass north of 20°N was estimated to be 2–4 times larger than the proportion of biomass south 20°N; consequently, it should be designated as a northern stock for process reasons. The United States noted its continuing  48    concern about North Pacific striped marlin and looked forward to a new stock assessment from ISC in 2019, and stated it intended to introduce a rebuilding plan for North Pacific striped marlin in 2019. The United States stated the stock would benefit from the designation, because NC could then begin a discussion on rebuilding and bring a sound recommendation for the Commission to consider."
WCPFC15,282,"The EU stated that the table provided by SC14 was a useful tool for making such an assessment, but stated there was a need to list the CCMs involved in harvesting the species (directly or indirectly), as not all are members of the NC. The EU inquired whether any subsidiary bodies had taken action for the species, noting the recurring recommendations from the SC, and the continuing circular discussion at Commission meetings. It observed the stock is heavily overfished, and recommended that the Commission recommend that ISC conduct projections, and that based on that advice and recommendations from SC15, WCPFC16 should adopt a recovery plan."
WCPFC15,283,"RMI, on behalf of FFA members, noted the long-standing debate over whether or not certain stocks, including North Pacific striped marlin, should be designated as northern stocks. They stated that clear criteria for making this determination are still absent, and that while the debate has continued, important stocks are not being managed. They stated the problem was exacerbated by SC not being given the opportunity to properly review the science for the stocks, as assessments are conducted by ISC with no real opportunity for proper review by WCPFC. They stated that the lack of agreement on the designation of the stocks was affecting their proper management and impacting on the reputation of WCPFC and its members. They observed the NC has seemingly become a “Commission within a Commission” with its own science and rules. They opposed designation of any additional stocks as northern stocks, noting that a number of FFA members have an interest in the stocks under discussion and are determined to see them managed effectively by the Commission. They stated they expected stock assessments for the stocks to be presented to SC to allow for comprehensive review by all CCMs, and CCMs having the greatest impact on the stocks to bring management proposals to WCPFC for debate and hopefully approval."
WCPFC15,284,"Canada agreed that the issue had been tabled many times and appreciated the clarity SC brought to the issue. It endorsed the approach of the United States proposal, which it stated was in line with the convention text and intent, and enabled further action in response to the scientific advice."
WCPFC15,285,"FSM, on behalf of FFA members, stated that key information to determine whether North Pacific striped marlin is a northern stock is not available, and therefore it should remain as a WCPO stock. They noted the United States has submitted a draft rebuilding plan to NC14 for north Pacific striped marlin, but stated that a full stock assessment needs to be undertaken prior to the establishment of the rebuilding plan to inform the current starting point, the appropriate risk level, and the appropriate rebuilding period. They proposed that WCPFC15 request the ISC to present a new full stock assessment for north Pacific striped marlin to SC15 in 2019 so that Commission members are able to assess the appropriate level of risk and the appropriate rebuilding period to rebuild stocks to 0.2SBF=0."
WCPFC15,286,"Japan noted that its colleague from ISC indicated that results of the stock assessment have been provided to SC; the last assessment was performed in 2015, and presented to SC. It stated that it nevertheless seemed that the Commission, as a whole, was less interested than NC members in northern stocks. Japan stated if the species was designated as a northern stock, NC could act, based on the 2019 stock assessment; otherwise the Commission would be facing the same issues in 2019. Japan indicated its wish was not to occupy this stock by NC members, but to focus on conservation and management of the stock."
WCPFC15,287,"The Chair stated it was unfortunate that the same discussion was repeated each year. She noted any member could provide a recommendation to the Commission, and that there was no lack of data for  49    anyone to take action. She noted that WCPFC14 had agreed to try and resolve the designation issue, and that SC14 did what was asked, but that the criteria did not help, and inquired whether a rebuilding plan could be developed."
WCPFC15,288,"The United States stated that it was asking that North Pacific striped marlin be designated as a northern stock because it would raise the priority for NC and require NC to take action. It observed that all NC decisions are brought to the Commission for adoption, and that all stock assessments for northern stocks are reviewed by SC before they are acted upon. The United States noted again the clear information from SC14, and stated that if WCPFC15 declined to designate the stock as a northern stock the Commission should not come back to the issue."
WCPFC15,289,"The NC Chair acknowledged the frustration expressed by the WCPFC Chair. He noted that when NC advised on species not designated as northern stocks, that advice was typically ignored, and that NC was consequently very reluctant to work on species that had not been designated as northern stocks. The Chair noted that the designation issue was almost impossible to resolve, but that management of the stock, which is the is core business of the Commission, has been neglected in part because of the designation question, and stated it needed to be set aside."
WCPFC15,290,"CCMs held further discussions regarding designation and action on a rebuilding plan. RMI noted it was prepared to work with FFA and others to develop a measure for the stock. The EU agreed on the need to take action, and asked whether NC could be tasked with proposing a rebuilding plan, or SC or SPC should be tasked with this. EU suggested there should be a clear timeline of what is to be done and by whom."
WCPFC15,291,"The United States reiterated its view that harvest strategies need not be in the form of a CMM, and committed to submitting a draft rebuilding plan for consideration by WCPFC16."
WCPFC15,292,"The Commission noted that it was unable to agree on the designation of North Pacific striped marlin as a northern stock.  The Commission acknowledged that North Pacific striped marlin is experiencing overfishing and is overfished and notes that the ISC work plan for 2018-19 includes completing a benchmark North Pacific striped marlin assessment which will be presented to SC15.  The Commission agreed with the concern expressed by SC and NC over the status of North Pacific striped marlin.  It accepted the recommendations of SC11, SC12, SC13 and SC14 that the Commission develop a rebuilding plan, and of NC13 and NC14 which “urged the Commission to develop a rebuilding plan for the stock as a matter of priority”.  In the absence of any action in response to date, the Commission strongly encouraged those CCMs whose fleets are catching North Pacific striped marlin to submit a draft rebuilding plan to WCPFC16 to provide for the update of CMM 2010-01 Conservation and Management Measure for North Pacific Striped Marlin. 6.7 Others"
WCPFC15,293,"Australia noted the scientific advice and recommendation by SC13, which was confirmed by SC14, on the rapid increases in fishing mortality and declines in spawning biomass between the mid-1990s and 2010 and the subsequent need for stronger management of South Pacific swordfish, including development of appropriate management measures for the area north of 20°S. Australia noted that in the context of those recommendations it considers the current CMM to be relatively weak, with little capacity to prevent further increases in fishing mortality, representing a real risk for the future of the stock. Noting this and SC’s recommendations, Australia stated it would explore further options for improved management of the South Pacific swordfish and would submit recommendations to SC15 and  50    TCC15 in 2019. It stated it would be mindful of Article 30 of the Convention and the need to avoid disproportionate impact on SIDS.  AGENDA ITEM 7  — HARVEST STRATEGY  7.1 Management Objectives (all stocks/fisheries)"
WCPFC15,294,"The Chair noted that the outcomes of discussions on tropical purse seine fisheries at WCPFC13 and in the “strawman document” were not agreed but were used by SPC as indicative in terms of MSE, and have been included in SC discussions regarding performance indicators. She stated that the management objectives were likely to form part of the proposed 2019 dialog for which TORs are being considered.  7.2 Monitoring Strategy (all stocks/fisheries)  There was no discussion under this agenda item.  7.3 Harvest Strategy for Pacific bluefin, North Pacific albacore and North Pacific swordfish"
WCPFC15,295,"The NC Chair stated that a harvest strategy had been adopted for Pacific bluefin tuna and North Pacific albacore, and these have been adopted by the Commission. The NC is now working on MSEs; workshops have been held for Pacific bluefin tuna and North Pacific albacore. Work has started on a harvest strategy for North Pacific swordfish."
WCPFC15,296,"The representative of Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Foundation (who indicated it had an interest in the import and distribution of tuna, swordfish and mahi mahi into North American and EU markets) noted its specific interest in North Pacific swordfish and pan-Pacific mahi mahi. It stated that there is a growing market demand for sustainability assurance for all fish products and an imperative to support small-scale fisheries. With regard to swordfish, recognising the progress the Commission has made for the North Pacific stock, it asked the Commission to continue to develop the harvest strategy, but also to urgently implement management reference points for the stock to address the market needs. The same market needs for visible sustainability apply to mahi mahi. It requested the Commission to: (i) ensure all fishery participants are immediately required to provide catch and effort data for this species; (ii) instruct SC to develop an appropriate stock assessment within the next three years; and (iii) in advance of the delivery of the stock assessment, define precautionary management measures based on the results of the productivity-susceptibility analysis reported in WCPFC–SC2–2006/EB WP–1. The Foundation noted that all stocks need reference points, but believe these stocks should be prioritised."
WCPFC15,297,"In reply to a query from the EU regarding financial support needed for the MSE work, the NC Chair stated that financial support was provided by member countries, including Japan and the United States, and that enough resources were available to pursue the work. 7.4 Terms of Reference for a Science-Management Dialogue"
WCPFC15,298,"SPC introduced WCPFC15-2018-20: Key decisions for Managers and Scientists under the Harvest Strategy Approach for WCPO tuna stocks and fisheries, noting that the paper provides ideas on decisions managers will need to consider as the harvest strategy process proceeds.  It noted the key role of the science–management dialogue was to address cross-cutting issues, enable managers to provide leadership and guidance to scientists, and to facilitate the iterative decision-making process and enable provision of feedback.  51"
WCPFC15,299,"RMI noted the need to address multiple gear and species fisheries, and to examine principles and practicalities for data collection. It warned against revisiting issues that had already been addressed."
WCPFC15,300,"The EU suggested that the Science Management Dialogue, at least in the beginning, should not be seen as the forum where the decisions for the key elements of harvest strategies would be decided, but rather as an opportunity for Managers to better understand their role and effectively get involved in the MSE process. That would allow staring a constructive dialogue by focusing initially on non-contentious issues."
WCPFC15,301,China stated that it understood the majority of CCMs would like to have a mechanism for a science-management dialogue but stated that participation in this approach in other RFMOs is very low.
WCPFC15,302,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC15-2018-21: Terms of reference for a science management dialogue. He stated that WCPFC14 agreed to reprioritize the agendas for the Commission and SC meetings to provide sufficient time to allow for a discussion of the WCPO harvest strategy, and recognized the need for a dedicated science-management dialogue. The terms of reference (TORs) were developed in response to that recognition by the Commission, and were developed jointly by the Secretariat and SPC, to provoke discussion on two components: consideration elements and consultative draft TORs. Discussions were held at SC14, both in plenary and in a SWG. The TORs in WCPFC15-2018-21 are a refinement that account for the discussions at SC14. The objectives of the dialogue are to (i) enhance mutual understanding and capacity building, (ii) facilitate the iterative process of harvest strategy decision-making by the Commission and its committees, and (iii) to refine candidate harvest strategy options and forward a reduced number of acceptable candidates to the Commission to increase effectiveness.  The key tasks of the dialogue are to review and refine SC outputs on MSE, and make recommendations to the Commission regarding appropriate candidate harvest strategies that meet management objectives for the fishery stocks."
WCPFC15,303,"SPC outlined Appendix 1 of WCPFC15-2018-21 to provide an idea of how an initial meeting could be structured, suggesting two days would be appropriate."
WCPFC15,304,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the Executive Director and recalled agreement at SC14 that such a dialogue would be useful to help the Commission make use of best-practice fishery management processes, as well as some disagreements on matters of detail. They outlined that FFA members’ view was that the first meeting of the science-management dialogue should be a trial — if the subsequent Commission meeting assesses it has not met its probationary objectives, it would be discontinued.  They stated the recommendations of the body should carry weight within the Commission, and it should be a formal subsidiary body of the Commission in the form of a Committee under Article 11(6) of the Convention. It would not be a capacity-building workshop, but would make recommendations for consideration by the Commission, and should include a scientific and a management representative from each CCM. They noted the paper suggests the dialogue begin through an informal ""capacity-building"" session, followed by a formal ""decision-making"" session, but FFA members feel strongly this should not be a capacity-building process; after four capacity-building management objectives workshops, further learning about the Harvest Strategy Approach should be by implementing it. Other stakeholders should either be included in national delegations, or as observers, and closed sessions should be allowed for any discussions as decided by the committee."
WCPFC15,305,"Japan expressed no preference whether this should be a subsidiary body or more informal working group, but stated that if it will make recommendations, it should be a subsidiary body. It preferred it be held in conjunction with the annual meeting, because its scientists attend SC, while managers attend the annual meeting. It expressed concern that SPC stated it could not calculate all indicators for skipjack and stated a discussion would have to be held on how these could be calculated.  52"
WCPFC15,306,"Niue, on behalf of FFA members, supported earlier comments by New Zealand, and stated that in their view: a) this would not be a body to filter the output of SC, and SC would continue to report directly to the Commission. This would be a body for generating science-based management recommendations to the Commission, while SC would continue to provide scientific input and answers to questions posed by the Commission; b) it should not be restricted to considering only the application of the harvest strategy approach —other aspects of best practice management should also be considered, including the application of the ecosystem approach, and measuring and accounting for social and economic drivers of fishery performance. It could also be useful in advising the Commission on aspects of allocation between CCMs, in their roles as flag States and coastal States; c) the dialogue should have a role in reviewing (and possibly developing) harvest strategy measures, and should not affect the right of individual or groups of CCMs to propose measures; and  d) FFA members feel very strongly it should meet immediately after SC, as clearly explained at SC14. SC should to be shortened slightly to make room for the dialogue to follow, and FFA members have a proposal for doing so."
WCPFC15,307,"PNG, on behalf of the PNA, supported the comments of New Zealand and Niue, and supported beginning a science-management dialogue in 2019. They noted this could help the Commission to mainstream harvest strategy development in its work. They noted that PNA support for the dialogue is contingent on the meeting happening immediately after SC, in order to optimise efficiency and have the greatest chance of influencing decision making at the following Commission meeting."
WCPFC15,308,"The EU expressed its general agreement with the principles of the TORs of the working group and voiced a preference to adopt a progressive approach on the science-management dialogue that might start by the constitution of a working group, and which could later evolve to a subsidiary body, if necessary. At the same time, for practical reasons and to contain financial participatory costs related to the participation of managers in this group, the meeting of the working group should be organised back to back to the Annual Meeting, at least in the first stages of the working group. This would facilitate the participation of all relevant stakeholders and enable a smooth start of the working group but could be changed at a later stage to another schedule arrangement when the working group is more organised and according to the needs of the dialogue."
WCPFC15,309,"The United States voiced general support for establishment of a working group for the harvest strategy. It suggested it could be open to involvement of external experts, and suggested the need for flexibility in terms of its function and size, but stated that the focus should be on the harvest strategy."
WCPFC15,310,"Chinese Taipei supported having a physical meeting in 2019 to progress harvest strategy development. It suggested the meeting be held as a working group in 2019, and whether or not to form a subsidiary body could be considered in the future. It supported having managers, scientists and stakeholders at the meeting, and stated it should be held one or two days before the annual meeting to be most cost-effective. This position was also voiced by the EU which noted the importance to consider the cost implications."
WCPFC15,311,"Canada support holding a dialogue that includes fisheries managers, scientists and others (e.g., industry and NGOs). It suggested further discussion was needed on the structure of the body."
WCPFC15,312,"Korea supported establishment of a dialogue through a working group under the control of the Commission. It noted it could be given authority in the terms of reference to ensure that it can make appropriate recommendations, and suggested it be co-chaired initially by the TCC and SC chairs (with  53    others possibly elected subsequently to reduce the workload of the TCC and SC chairs). Korea suggested one senior fisheries scientist and one manager should attend for each CCM, as well as other stakeholders, with a two-day meeting to cover the four key stocks. Korea suggested that the dialogue be scheduled in conjunction with the annual meeting and focus on the development of the harvest strategy."
WCPFC15,313,The Philippines supported the statements by the EU and Korea.
WCPFC15,314,"Palau on behalf of the PNA Chair, stated they were only prepared to support the proposed dialogue if it is held immediately following SC. They noted this has been their consistent position since the management objectives/harvest strategy workshop process ceased in 2015, and that the PNA sees no merit in a meeting held in conjunction with the WCPFC annual meeting because delegations then arrive with their national positions already determined.  They noted that some key delegations did not participate at the senior level in the management options workshops, making the discussions there useless. Holding meetings late in the year and in conjunction with the Commission presents serious disruption to FFA and PNA member preparation, which they cannot sustain. PNA was adamant the proposed dialogue can only work in conjunction with the SC."
WCPFC15,315,"RMI, on behalf of the PNA, stated they were relatively relaxed about the formal classification of the dialogue, but that to be effective it: • should be able to make recommendations to the Commission that have the same weight as issues forwarded by SC and TCC;  • not be simply a capacity building workshop;  • be subject to the normal rules of participation, quorum, chairing and decision-making; and  • have funding for participation by a scientist and a manager from each SIDS."
WCPFC15,316,"Indonesia supported the proposal for a science–management dialogue, but noted the need for information on the cost implications. The Executive Director provided the following estimates: for a 2-day meeting attached to SC and held in Pohnpei, about US$85,000. If a stand-alone meeting in Pohnpei, around US$180,000. If held in conjunction with WCPFC16 in Port Moresby, about US$98,000. In response to a query from the EU, the Executive Director stated that for a dialogue held after SC, the amount quoted was the cost of an additional ticket to bring in a manager, because the Commission already funds a delegate to SC. For stand-alone meetings the cost is for both delegates. If the dialogue is held in conjunction with the annual meeting the cost is for one additional ticket, hopefully for a national scientist."
WCPFC15,317,"The Chair summarised that there was broad support for the need for the dialogue to happen, which would focus on development of harvest strategy elements. With regard to the structure, while there was no broad support for a formal subsidiary body, members supported formal status, so it can provide advice to the Commission. She noted the divergence was on the timing. She suggested putting the timing issue aside and focussing on the TORs."
WCPFC15,318,"Following further discussion in a SWG, Japan stated that while Article 11, paragraph 6 of the Convention allowed for the establishment of subsidiary bodies, including working groups, which can report to the Commission, Japan was unsure whether it can make recommendations to the Commission, or to SC or TCC. The Legal Adviser confirmed that Article 11, paragraph 6 of the Convention provides for the Commission to establish subsidiary bodies and working groups. She noted this was a broad function within the Convention. She stated that a review of past practice in the Commission indicated that intersessional working groups had been established and had provided recommendations directly to  54    the Commission and also to other subsidiary bodies. She noted the Commission has a fairly broad mandate. Japan stated that while past practice was not strictly speaking legal advice, if the Commission had been doing this, and CCMs supported it, Japan could also support it."
WCPFC15,319,"The Chair stated that members were in agreement to see how the process would work during the first year, and had agreed on it being a working group, but needed to determine how outcomes are handled, and whether they should be channelled through SC and TCC. Earlier discussions had suggested a separate forum was needed to develop harvest strategy options and if the aim is to advance harvest strategy work, the group needs to have that ability. Currently practice is to establish IWGs that provide recommendations to the Commission, and this proposed process would be similar. The Commission is adopting a long-term approach to harvest strategies but are taking a trial approach for 2019."
WCPFC15,320,"Canada stated its assumption that recommendations would come to the Commission, and if needed to SC for further advice and analysis."
WCPFC15,321,"Indonesia stated its understanding that the proposed working group would focus on communications between scientists and managers. It noted SC outputs mostly address stock assessment work, but MSEs and the harvest strategy will be different, and not really focussed on stock assessments. Indonesia suggested a step could be missing, and requested further explanation, perhaps from SPC, on the harvest strategies and how to arrange the process."
WCPFC15,322,"The Chair noted the issue was how the dialogue communicates with SPC so that the Commission can then make decisions. She noted that after past discussions on the harvest strategy, the Commission tasked SPC with work that was provided to subsequent meetings. She asked members whether they preferred tasking SPC in December to return the next December, or to provide the taskings in August, with results provided in December. She noted that the objective was to help inform the Commission and enable it to make decisions. The timing of meeting would influence the ability of SPC to provide advice, and asked delegates to confirm their views on timing of the meeting."
WCPFC15,323,"The members reiterated their previous positions, with some advocating for holding the dialogue in conjunction with SC, and others for holding a two-day session prior to the annual meeting. The Chair summarized the views expressed, and the challenges associated with each proposal. She asked the Commission to consider how quickly it sought to progress the harvest strategy work, noting that a workplan exists but has not been advanced."
WCPFC15,324,"Following further discussions with members, and in the absence of a compromise, the Chair proposed the harvest strategy discussion be held during the Commission regular annual session, where the SC report and SPC advice were available. She noted this would entail extending the Commission meeting (with some cost implications) or reducing its agenda."
WCPFC15,325,"Pew stated that Commission members had agreed that development of harvest strategies was a core component of the Commission’s business and one of the most important elements of its future work. It stated that the Commission needed to give the harvest strategy work the serious attention it deserves, which requires both time and having the right people at the table. It encouraged the Commission to revisit the idea of a science-management dialogue and find a way to allow the necessary discussion to occur, and experiment with different schedules, perhaps rotating from being associated with one Commission meeting to another."
WCPFC15,326,"RMI and Tokelau supported the Chair’s proposal in view of the lack of a compromise, with Tokelau stating that it was a sound idea to mainstream the harvest strategy issues into the work of the Commission, while allowing for some discussion in the SC.  The EU stated it would support the Chair’s  55    proposal, noting it was clear that various members had different ideas of what the dialogue should achieve, and that some saw it as an opportunity to prepare for the next annual meeting. The EU reiterated its view that initially the dialogue should focus on improving managers capacity to engage effectively in shaping the MSE framework. It stated that if it is scheduled as a stand-alone dialogue it should be distinct from the agenda of the Commission. EU noted that at present only a few people understand the mechanics of the MSE (and they probably work for SPC), and there was a need to have managers involved, which is in the essence the dialogue. Tonga stated they understood the importance of the dialogue and supported the Chair’s proposal. Australia stated they had hoped to secure agreement for a dialogue, but in its absence recognized the importance of progressing the work through the SC, TCC and Commission meetings. Australia suggested that the harvest strategy dialogue discussion should continue in 2019, and the question of how to progress the science-management dialogue be revisited at SC16."
WCPFC15,327,"Commission members agreed to extend the WCPFC16 meeting by one day to allow for more in-depth discussion of harvest strategy issues. The Secretariat estimated that the additional cost for such an extension was approximately US$6,000. The Chair noted that members would have input to the agenda and scheduling when arrangements for WCPFC16 were finalized, and that a decision on whether to continue this approach for subsequent Commission meetings could be made by WCPFC16, particularly in light of the desire of some members to revisit the issue of a dialog at WCPFC16."
WCPFC15,328,The Commission agreed to hold a 6-day annual meeting in 2019 with additional time devoted for the Commission to discuss harvest strategies.    7.5 Review of Work Plan
WCPFC15,329,"The Chair noted that WCPFC14 adopted WCPFC15-2018-IP09: Agreed workplan for the adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06. The Chair of the Harvest Strategy SWG (Australia) introduced revisions to the workplan that reflected SPC capacity and resource constraints. It noted that the workplan had initially called for SPC to commence MSE work on bigeye and yellowfin in 2019, but that work was now deferred to 2020 because of constraints faced by SPC. Australia noted the addition of three items for 2019:  a) South Pacific albacore — identifying a range of alternative catch pathways to the interim TRP and timeframes that achieve this; b) Skipjack — SC to advise on required analyses to support TRP review; and c) SPC to review potential options to capture multi species issues under the harvest strategy process. Regarding the need for clarity on whether decisions on harvest strategy elements are “interim”, the proposed approach is for the workplan to not state whether a future decision will be interim or otherwise but to simply schedule the decision and then let the Commission determine its interim nature. A more substantial review of the Harvest Strategy Workplan, with inclusion of more detail, is anticipated during SC15 and WCPFC16."
WCPFC15,330,"Japan noted its earlier concern regarding difficulties faced by SPC in calculating some performance indicators for skipjack for the purpose of estimating skipjack MSE, especially in relation to avoiding impacts on small fishers. Japan noted its prior intention to address the issue through the harvest strategy working group, but given that a working group meeting would not be held it wanted to (i) confirm that SPC cannot calculate these indicators, and (ii) if that was correct, confirm that a CCM could present the issue in a paper relating to calculation of the skipjack TRP.  56"
WCPFC15,331,"SPC stated that as part of the harvest strategy work it was conducting extensive stakeholder engagement as it sought to develop performance indicators. SPC agreed that the MSE framework would not include as many of the performance indicators as stakeholders wanted to see because of the need for a proper modelling framework, and some aspects (e.g., allocation) are very hard to model. SPC stated it would do its best to develop proxies or other quantities that can inform these questions. With respect to the issue raised by Japan it stated it should be possible to get some information on skipjack abundance in areas where small scale fisheries are located, but that it would discuss the issue in detail as work progressed. Japan stated it would be happy to cooperate with SPC on the issue."
WCPFC15,332,"In response to a suggestion from China, the Chair noted the presentation of species in the workplan was not an indication of their priority."
WCPFC15,333,"The Commission adopted the Updated Workplan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 (WCPFC15-2018-HS_SWGWorkPlan_01, dated 14 December 2018) (Attachment I*).   AGENDA ITEM 8  — WCPO SHARK STOCKS AND BYCATCH MITIGATION"
WCPFC15,334,"The Chair noted that a reference document had been prepared — WCPFC15-2018-22: Reference document for bycatch mitigation CMM reviews.    8.1 Report of the Shark-IWG, including Proposal for a Comprehensive CMM for Sharks and Rays"
WCPFC15,335,"Shingo Ota (Japan), the IWG-Sharks Chair noted that the IWG had operated under TORs agreed at WCPFC14, and thanked the participants, and Dr Shelley Clarke, who had assisted as technical advisor. He stated that prior drafts had been circulated, with the 4th draft reviewed by SC14, the 5th draft by TCC14, with the 6th draft available for review at WCPFC15 (WCPFC15-2018-IWGSharks: 6th Draft Consolidated Text for the Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks)."
WCPFC15,336,"During WCPFC15 an SWG was established to review and refine the 6th draft. After several rounds of discussion, the SWG produced a draft CMM for sharks. During the SWG Japan submitted a proposal to replace, among others, para 7 of CMM 2010-07 (how to implement full utilization of sharks) as follows: “9. In order to implement the obligation in paragraph 8, in [2019, 2020, 2021] as an interim measure, CCMs shall require their vessels to land sharks with fins naturally attached to the carcass or to take alternative compatible measures to ensure that individual shark carcasses and their corresponding fins can be identified on board the vessel, such as:  • individual shark carcass with corresponding fins are stored in bag; • fins are bound to the carcass using rope or wire; or • tags are attached both to shark carcasses and corresponding fins 10.  All CCMs shall report on the implementation of the measures in paragraph 9 no later than 30 July each year for review by TCC. The report by CCMs shall contain the detailed explanation of implementation of paragraph 9 including how the compliance can be monitored. The TCC in [2021] shall recommend the measures for [2022] and thereafter to implement the obligations in paragraph 8 [and 8bis] to be adopted in the Commission.”  57"
WCPFC15,337,"Although the SWG extensively discussed this proposal and made many refinements, no consensus was reached. The SWG agreed, however, that this proposed language could be a good basis for future discussion, and thus should be recorded in the minutes of WCPFC15."
WCPFC15,338,"During plenary discussions regarding the SWG outcomes, some members noted the need for better reporting requirements, and others called for review of the proposal by TCC."
WCPFC15,339,"Australia stated that while it was disappointed that the Commission is unable to adopt a combined measure on sharks at WCPFC15, it wished to thank Japan for the huge amount of work in consulting with Commission members through the year, leading the small working group, and its efforts to develop alternative measures in concert with their industry. Australia looked forward to building on this work at WCPFC16. The United States also expressed its thanks to the IWG-Sharks Chair, and looked forward to further discussions in 2019 to strengthen the measure."
WCPFC15,340,"The EU also thanked the IWG-Sharks Chair for his hard work to progress a new CMM for Sharks. Despite no consensus being reached the EU considered that the work done during the Annual Meeting SWG opened new avenues that could be important for next year's decision making, which would also require intersessional preparation. The EU regretted that the alternative/compatible measures proposed for the monitoring of the implementation of the finning ban had not been discussed during the intersessional work of the dedicated IWG. It indicated that these alternative measures were proposed too late (towards the end of the Annual Meeting) and were not documented to allow members to make informed decisions. It invited the proponents to develop these intersessionally and to provide to SC and/or TCC15 documented evidence that these measures can be effectively enforced (including at sea), monitored and that they will not create any loopholes."
WCPFC15,341,The Commission tasked TCC15 with considering the outputs of the shark intersessional working group and encouraged interested Members to submit proposals to TCC15.   8.2 Proposal for Best Practice Guidelines for Safe Release of Sharks
WCPFC15,342,The Commission adopted the Best Practice Guidelines for Safe Release of Sharks (Attachment J).    8.3 North Pacific blue shark – Designation as a northern stock
WCPFC15,343,"The United States stated that it examined the information provided by SC14 regarding designation of North Pacific blue shark as a northern stock, but stated that the data did not allow making a determination that the stock is mostly located north of 20°N, and that the United States believes it does not support designation as a northern stock at this time. There were no other discussions under this agenda item.  8.4 Review of CMM 2017-06 on Seabirds"
WCPFC15,344,"New Zealand introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP16: Seabird Interaction Mitigation: Amendment of CMM 2017-06 and expressed thanks to various members for helping with the proposal, and to SPC for helping to prepare scientific information to support the proposal. The amendments would add hook-shielding devices to the list of acceptable measures to reduce seabird bycatch south of 30°S, and add a requirement to require the use of seabird mitigation measures in the area 30°S to 25°S.   58"
WCPFC15,345,"The measure was discussed in a SWG, and members reached consensus in plenary regarding WCPFC15-2018-DP16_rev2 following further small changes. New Zealand thanked all members for their support for the measure and for their work over several years."
WCPFC15,346,"Australia expressed its appreciation to New Zealand for its work on the issue. New Caledonia thanked all the delegates for their input on this issue and particularly delegates from the EU, China, Korea and Japan for the efforts made to take into account their specific circumstances. New Caledonia stated that it would continue operating transparently and seeking to ensure sustainability, and would seek to improve data collection between 25° S and 30° S by increasing observer coverage as much as possible."
WCPFC15,347,"French Polynesia also thanked all those involved, and especially New Zealand for coordinating the positions of all interested parties, and for considering the fisheries development aspirations of SIDS. It noted that much remained to be done for seabirds, and that French Polynesia was ready to assist whenever possible."
WCPFC15,348," The EU also thanked members for their hard work. It noted that during the discussion that the EU was opposed to the exceptions within the measure but stated that these were not that important at present, because they did not have relevant impacts on seabirds. EU stated that if fisheries are developed in zones that are currently exempted from the measure there would be impacts and given that members have a responsibility to protect endangered species, there could be a need for revisions in the future."
WCPFC15,349,The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2018-03 Conservation and Management Measure to Mitigate the Impact of Fishing for Highly Migratory Fish Stocks on Seabirds (Attachment K).   8.5 Review of CMM 2008-03 on Sea Turtles
WCPFC15,350,"The United States introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP06: Revisions to CMM 2008-03 Conservation and Management Measure of sea turtles and WCPFC15-2018-DP07: Amendments to the WCPFC Regional Observer Programme minimum standard data fields, both of which seek to increase sea turtle protection, and stated it looked forward to additional work in the margins of WCPFC15 to progress the measures."
WCPFC15,351,"Following significant discussions in the margins of WCPFC15, the Commission reached agreement regarding revisions to CMM 2008-03. The United States thanked members for their cooperation on the issue, noting it was a very important step. Regarding WCPFC15-2018-DP07, the United States noted that work to modify the ROP minimum data standards was ongoing and stated that it looked forward to continuing work with members to further progress the issue in 2019 and beyond."
WCPFC15,352,"The Commission agreed to adopt CMM 2018-04 Conservation and Management Measure for Conservation and Management of Sea Turtles (Attachment L), with a date of implementation of 1 January 2020.   AGENDA ITEM 9  — ADOPTION OF REPORTS FROM SUBSIDIARY BODIES"
WCPFC15,353,"The reports of the subsidiary bodies were taken by the Chair as read and were not presented to the Commission. However, recommendations of subsidiary bodies not addressed under other agenda items were considered under this agenda item.   59    9.1  SC14"
WCPFC15,354,"The Chair referred the Commission to WCPFC15-2018-23: Synopsis of SC14 summary report for agenda item 9.1. She noted that in addition to SC14 recommendations addressed under other agenda items, SC14 had recommended to the Commission that it initiate efforts to identify and promote best practices for safe release of whale sharks."
WCPFC15,355,"The EU stated that the work of the SC and advice the Commission received was outstanding and thanked its members. It suggested that it would be useful when discussing projections for species under management to consider both very long-term projections, and shorter periods (e.g. 5 years, and up to 15 or 20 years) to further inform Commission decisions. It also stated that it perceived there were inconsistencies in terms of the advice offered for various species. As an example, the EU contrasted the very precautionary advice offered for bigeye tuna, which had a quite positive stock status assessment, and the lack of proportionately cautionary advice for Pacific bluefin tuna, the stock of which has been assessed to be overfished, with overfishing occurring. The EU suggested the need to ensure there is greater consistency among species when advice is elaborated (e.g., advice reflecting the conservation status and existing management objectives)."
WCPFC15,356,"The Chair noted these were helpful suggestions for members to keep in mind, observing that the stakes of Commission decisions were increasing, and members could always think about how to do business better. She stated there was a need to match information, advice and decisions, and a need to look at cases where the Commission did not receive advice on issues for which it asked for advice."
WCPFC15,357,The Commission adopted the SC14 Summary Report (WCPFC15-2018-SC14).   9.2  NC14
WCPFC15,358,"The Chair referred the Commission to WCPFC15-2018-NC14: NC14 Summary Report (Revision 1), during the discussion of the NC14 Summary Report and relevant recommendations."
WCPFC15,359,"The United States stated it was encouraged by progress in undertaking the North Pacific albacore MSE, and that an MSE for Pacific bluefin tuna had been initiated. It noted these multi-year evaluations required resources from commission members and stated that a good plan to undertake the MSE was in place for North Pacific albacore, and that a plan was being formulated for Pacific bluefin tuna."
WCPFC15,360,The Commission adopted the report of NC14 (WCPFC15-2018-NC14).   9.3  TCC14
WCPFC15,361,"The Commission was referred to WCPFC15-2018-24_rev1: Reference Paper for TCC14 Recommendations for Agenda 9.3 – revision 1, which was prepared as a quick reference guide to the recommendations of TCC14 of relevance to WCPFC15 discussions. The full report of TCC14 was also tabled for consideration (WCPFC14-2018-TCC14: TCC14 Summary Report Final - issued 30 November 2018).  60    9.3.1 Regional Observer Programme"
WCPFC15,362,"The Commission agreed to adopt the TCC14 recommended amendments to CMM 2007-01, CMM 2018-05, Conservation and Management Measure for the Regional Observer Programme, (Attachment M)."
WCPFC15,363,The Commission agreed to adopt the TCC14 recommended amendments to the ROP minimum standards (Attachment N).
WCPFC15,364,"The Commission agreed that the TCC Observer-related working group would continue to operate electronically in 2019, led by Mr. Tom Graham (United States).  The TCC Observer-related working group was tasked to: a. Conduct further work, with input from the Secretariat and drawing from experiences using the Compliance Case File System and CCMs’ investigations, to determine what additional data fields, if any, should be added to the ROP minimum required data fields to support CCM investigations and more general compliance-related needs, such as flagging possible violations of Commission decisions to trigger CCM investigations or as part of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (also see task (f)).  b. More fully consider gaps in the capacity of ROP Providers to respond promptly and fully to requests for observer reports, such as in terms of human resources, training, and equipment, and explore ways to fill those gaps, including the possibility of a process through which ROP Providers may seek and receive financial or other support from the Commission to improve their capacity. c. Explore ways to support ROP Providers’ efforts to improve their debriefing processes such that observer reports can be more fully vetted and provided more quickly, including the possibility of giving higher priority to trips that are flagged through the Pre-Notification Process (also see task (g)). d. Explore the potential utility of using the Compliance Case File System to facilitate and track CCM requests for observer reports. e. Explore whether pre-notifications can be sent by ROP Providers directly to the Secretariat without first having to be entered in the data service provider’s ROP database along with all the minimum required data fields. f. In concert with task (a), reconsider the summary data fields to better align with the Commission’s priorities in terms of compliance. g. In concert with task (c), explore the role debriefing can have in reviewing and filtering Trip Monitoring Summaries to make pre-notifications as efficient and useful as possible.  h. Explore, as part of the Pre-Notification Process, the possibility of supplementing the WCPFC Observer Trip Monitoring Summary form with more detailed information from the observer (e.g., using “comments” pages) regarding any affirmative indications on the Summary form, such as more detailed information about the activities in question, which could support a CCM’s investigations of those activities, and/or references to particular sections/pages of the full observer report that could help narrow a CCM’s request for more information from the ROP Provider. i. Continue to develop mechanisms related to the provision of observer reports, taking into account the outcomes of the tasks listed above and the possible approaches described in WCPFC-TCC14-2018-14 and WCPFC-TCC14-2018-DP07.    61    9.3.2 Transhipment"
WCPFC15,365,"The Chair noted that TCC14 held a lengthy discussion on transhipment, and that FFA member CCMs had submitted a paper on the issue to WCPFC15 (WCPFC15-2018-DP14: Transhipment Regulation: Review of CMM 2009-06)."
WCPFC15,366,"Tuvalu, on behalf of FFA members supported endorsement of the TCC report and its recommendations, in particular undertaking a review of CMM 2009-06 regarding transhipment as a priority in 2019. Noting that review will require detailed analysis, they offered to work with other CCMs on the terms of reference (TORs) and workplan for this issue."
WCPFC15,367,"China stated that high seas transhipment was of vital importance for distant water fisheries, which is why China has participated in the establishment of transhipment regulations in several RFMOs, including WCPFC. It noted unregulated high sea transhipment may be used for IUU fishing activities, and regulation of high seas transhipment is the basis of CMM 2009-06, with 100% observer coverage on receiving vessels, and detailed procedures. China noted that CMM 2009-06 had been implemented for eight years, and it was time for WCPFC to review its effectiveness, with a view not to ban high seas transhipment, but to simplify procedures for the purpose of reducing the work load of the WCPFC Secretariat staff and flag CCMs in reference to other tuna RFMOs (e.g., IOTC and ICCAT), especially with regard to reviewing the need to “notify the information in Annex III to the Executive Director at least 36 hours prior to each transhipment”, as called for in para. 35a(iii). In addition, China noted that the obligations under para. 35a(i-v) were to be undertaken “as appropriate”, and that its interpretation of “as appropriate” was that it should not conduct the obligation assessment of the paragraph as it had been in the past. With respect to para. 35.a.(v) calling on CCMs to “Submit to the Commission a plan detailing what steps it is taking to encourage transhipment to occur in port in the future”, China stated its view that this was not mandatory, because of the phrase “as appropriate” in para. 35a. It stated that its policy was to encourage Chinese fishing companies to invest in and use ports in SIDS, and that Chinese authorities could provide financial assistance to Chinese companies for infrastructure improvement, noting they had several examples where this occurred. China noted that current regulation of high seas transhipment activity was in line with the relevant provisions and objectives of the WCPFC Convention, but stated that it had been unable to access an annual transhipment report from the WCPFC Secretariat, and thus were unaware what the current level of high sea transhipment was, and could not assess the overall trend. China requested that the Secretariat provide such a report for WCPFC16."
WCPFC15,368,Tuvalu reiterated its strong support for a review of the measure in 2019.
WCPFC15,369,"The EU also supported a revision of the CMM on transhipment. It noted the various views held by members, and stated that transhipment is an open door for IUU fishing and other problems. The EU observed that its preference was to have no transhipment at sea, and that revising CMM 2009-06 would be difficult. The EU stated that, at a minimum, the level of observer coverage of transhipment should be increased."
WCPFC15,370,"Japan thanked FFA for their views, and agreed that transhipment at sea should be discussed at TCC15. It supported China’s intervention, and stated that strengthening the monitoring of existing legal transhipment would prevent illegal activities. Japan suggested that the TCC review should focus on how to prevent illegal transhipment by carrier vessels without observers."
WCPFC15,371,"RMI supported the intervention by Tuvalu and looked forward to working with other members on the issue. In response to a query regarding inclusion of the issue in the TCC workplan, the TCC-Vice Chair clarified that the issue had not been addressed in detail in the working group discussion on the TCC workplan.   62"
WCPFC15,372,"Chinese Taipei supported a review of the measure in 2019, and also supported the positions expressed by Japan and China."
WCPFC15,373,"Korea agreed that the measure be reviewed in 2019, noting that at-sea transhipment was an integral part of longline operations, especially for fishing fleets from Asia. It noted that the CMM was in the form of a recommendation rather than a regulation. Korea stated that very high penalties should be imposed in response to IUU activity but did not agree with a ban on at-sea transhipment."
WCPFC15,374,Papua New Guinea supported a review of the transhipment measure and asked that the Secretariat provide as much information as possible on transhipment on the high seas to support this.
WCPFC15,375,"FSM supported the comments from FFA, RMI and PNG, noting the issue had been discussed for some time. Given the proposal to ban high seas transhipment, it agreed a review was warranted, both to strengthen the measure and to enable a more robust approach to monitoring and compliance, and supported inclusion of the issue in the TCC workplan."
WCPFC15,376,"Canada supported holding a discussion on transhipment in 2019 and requested that the Secretariat provide an analysis of the existing situation with regard to transhipment, which should be included in the Secretariat’s workplan."
WCPFC15,377,"The Commission discussed establishment of an electronic IWG to review CMM 2009-06, and agreed it would be co-chaired by RMI and the United States, with data support provided by the Secretariat as available. PNG noted the importance of information related to the VMS, HSBI, and catch in the high seas pockets. The Chair noted that data availability could impact the work of the IWG and highlighted the need for consultations between the Secretariat and the co-chairs regarding timing and resource availability."
WCPFC15,378,"The Commission agreed to the TCC14 recommendation that the template provided in TCC14-2018 RP03 Annex 3 be used by all applicable CCMs for their future reporting in Annual Report Part 1, as per CMM 2009-06 paragraph 11 (Attachment O)."
WCPFC15,379,The Commission agreed that TCC’s assessment of a CCM under paragraph 13 of CMM 2009-06 will include that CCM’s report on observer coverage achieved for their carrier vessels conducting transhipment at sea in their Annual Report Part 2.
WCPFC15,380,"The Commission agreed to conduct a review of the existing transhipment measure (CMM 2009-06) in 2019, with the review to commence through an electronic intersessional working group, with the group led by two co-chairs, from RMI and the United States.    9.3.3 Commission VMS"
WCPFC15,381,"The Chair raised the issue of assessment of CMM 2014-02 paragraph 4. The TCC Chair stated that the issue arose at TCC14 during compliance analysis. Members expressed differing views on whether the measure was still relevant, but there was agreement that assessments could not be made against the obligation. The Chair stated that Commission should acknowledge that this presented difficulties for compliance assessment. The Chair stated that a resolution was not possible at WCPFC15. The Commission agreed not to assess the provision in 2019."
WCPFC15,382,"The EU stated that a key output of TCC was the identification of areas where TCC faced difficulties in making compliance assessments. It noted the limited time available to follow-up on key findings from  63    TCC and encouraged members to consider a process to resolve such issues. The EU observed that TCC14 had difficulties assessing compliance with the CMM related to FAD closures, and indicated that there was a risk that this happens again at TCC15."
WCPFC15,383,"The Chair stated that the CMR was adopted early during WCPFC15 in an effort to enable discussion on difficulties faced by TCC with respect to compliance monitoring. She noted that this could occur during regular reviews of CMMs, but stated that some issues did not come up for regular review. She stated that known problems must be addressed, and thanked the EU for its comments, and encouraged Members to consider the issue for resolution in the future."
WCPFC15,384,"Canada agreed that the issue should be considered during the review and the update of the CMS and TCC workplan, and suggested that review and development of audit points would be of help. The TCC Chair stated that TCC had worked to address a number of simpler issues over a number of years, and that what remained were the more complicated obligations, for which it was more difficult for TCC to provide good recommendations. She noted that the revised CMS process may enable additional room for this review."
WCPFC15,385,"The Commission agreed to extend the “Manual reporting in the event of ALC malfunction” requirement (Attachment 1 to the VMS SSPs) for a further two years (until 1 March 2021), taking into consideration the need for more timely provision of manual reports through automated online facilities or via electronic reporting where flag CCMs directly upload the required information."
WCPFC15,386,The Commission approved the addition to the WCPFC approved ALC/MTU list of the following ALC units: Model/Approved MTU Type Manufacturer Comm System Service Provider Skywave IDP-690 ORBCOMM/Skywave INMARSAT ISATDATA PRO Skywave ORBCOMM ST6100 ORBCOMM/Skywave INMARSAT ISATDATA PRO Skywave iTrac101B (iTrac II) MetOcean Telematics Iridium SBD MetOcean Telematics BB3 SASCO Iridium (mini LEO) SASCO BB5 SASCO Iridium (mini LEO) SASCO RomTrax Wifi Rom Communications Iridium SBD Rom Communications
WCPFC15,387,"The Commission agreed to amend the WCPFC VMS SSPs, section 2 paragraph 7, so that ALC/MTU units can be included on the approved ALC/MTU list based on the Secretariat’s Assessment that any newly nominated ALC/MTU meets the minimum standards and following a  64    specified period after the circulation of this advice to all CCMs.  The replacement paragraph for section 2 paragraph 7 is provided below: 7. The Secretariat will assess proposals for inclusion of additional ALC/MTU makes and models on this list from both CCMs and equipment manufacturers. The Secretariat shall include the ALC/MTU make or model being proposed on this list, if no CCM objects in writing within 30 days of the Secretariat circulating notice of its intent to all CCMs, and, if in the Secretariat’s assessment, the ALC/MTU make or model meets the minimum standards for the Commission VMS as set out in Annex 1 of CMM 2014-02 (or its successor measure), the WCPFC SSPs, as relevant, by determining that the ALC/MTU make and model has the ability to successfully report to the Commission VMS, and by using the methodology established by the FFA with expenses for type approval processing to be borne by the proposing entity. Where the Secretariat concludes in its assessment that a proposed ALC/MTU make or model does not meet these requirements, or if a CCM objects in writing to the Secretariat's proposal to approve a new ALC/MTU make or model, the Secretariat within the annual report shall make recommendations regarding the proposed ALC/MTU make or model for the TCC’s consideration and the Commission’s approval. The Secretariat will recommend, as needed, to TCC the removal of units currently on the list of approved ALC/MTU makes and models that it has determined no longer meet the minimum standards set out in Annex 1 of CMM2014-02 (or successor measure), or do not have the ability to successfully report to the Commission VMS. If an ALC/MTU make and model is removed from the list of approved ALC/MTU types, flag CCMs will ensure that their fishing vessels replace non-type approved ALC/MTUs with approved ALC/MTUs by the next replacement of the ALC/MTU, but no later than three years after the Commission’s decision."
WCPFC15,388,The Commission approved the updated Standard Operating Procedures for the WCPFC VMS (Attachment P).
WCPFC15,389,The Commission agreed that CMM 2014-02 paragraph 4 should not be included in the list of obligations for review by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme in 2019.     9.3.4 Expanding the requirement for IMO Numbers
WCPFC15,390,"The United States introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP05: Amendment to CMM 2017-05 to expand the requirement for IMO numbers, as recommended by TCC14, and expressed appreciation for the overall support for the proposal from Commission members. In reply to a query from Canada the United States stated that the proposed language was drawn from that used by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to avoid any conflicts with IMO Ship Identification Number Scheme. PNG, on behalf of FFA members, expressed their support for the proposal."
WCPFC15,391,The Philippines stated that at TCC14 its delegation asked for assistance from the proponent before adoption and noted that its concerns had been addressed.
WCPFC15,392,"Pew, speaking also on behalf of EDF, IPNLF, ISSF and WWF, commended the Commission on its decision to expand the requirement for IMO numbers, which they stated would have a positive effect on transparency and the ability of fisheries managers and enforcement agencies to identify and trace vessels. They stated it would further strengthen the monitoring, control, and surveillance programme of the WCPFC and the efforts of coastal States and fishing States in fighting illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Obtaining IMO numbers for eligible vessels is becoming increasingly easy, as the managers of the IMO work closer with flag States to help them fill their data gaps and obtain numbers  65    for their fleet, in bulk. They stated that they were ready to assist delegates in accessing further information on obtaining IMO Numbers, or get in direct contact with the programme’s managers."
WCPFC15,393,"The Commission agreed to amend CMM 2017-05 to expand the requirements for IMO numbers, and adopted CMM 2018-06 Conservation and Management Measure for WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels and Authorisation to Fish (Attachment Q, WCPFC15-2018-DP05).    9.3.5 High seas boarding and inspection: authorities of the fishing vessel"
WCPFC15,394,"The United States introduced WCPFC15-2018-DP31: High seas boarding and inspection: authorities of the fishing vessel (originally notified under Circular 2018/74) regarding submission to the Executive Director of the name(s) and contact information of its Authorities of the Fishing Vessel for the purpose of CMM 2006-08, noting that 11 CCMs have not identified their relevant authorities."
WCPFC15,395,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, noted that the United States should review their proposal in accordance with CMM 2013-06 to evaluate its impact on SIDS. Japan thanked the United States for its submission, and stated that it could support the proposal, but stated that in some cases it had provided contact points, but these were not shared within the same country. Japan noted this was particularly a problem with respect to the United States, which sometimes used old contact points. It requested that the United States distribute the most updated contact points within its government."
WCPFC15,396,"The Commission agreed that no later than 1 March 2019, any CCM that has not done so already shall submit to the Executive Director the name(s) and contact information of its Authorities of the Fishing Vessel for the purpose of CMM 2006-08.  If a CCM fails to do so by that date, the CCM’s primary official point of contact for the Commission shall be considered its Authorities of the Fishing Vessel, and the Executive Director will make that information available to CCMs on the public side of the WCPFC website, on the list of Authorities of the Fishing Vessel.  9.3.6 Update of TCC Workplan"
WCPFC15,397,"Mr Laurence Edwards (RMI), TCC Vice-Chair introduced the outcome of the SWG to update the TCC workplan: WCPFC15-2018-SWG TCC Work Plan: TCC Workplan 2019-2021.  He expressed his appreciation to the SWG participants and confirmed that the TCC Workplan was ready for adoption."
WCPFC15,398,"The Commission adopted the TCC Workplan 2019-2021 (Attachment R, WCPFC15-2018-SWG TCC Workplan)."
WCPFC15,399,The Commission adopted the report of TCC14 (WCPFC15-2018-TCC14).  9.4  ERandEMWG3
WCPFC15,400," The Chair referenced WCPFC15-2018-35: Reference paper for ERandEMWG3 recommendations for Agenda Item 9.4, taking the report as read."
WCPFC15,401,"The EU stated it supported acceptance of the report, with the understanding that the planned work to include FLUX in the WCPFC ER and EM standards will continue to be progressed, to ensure notably that those already using FLUX will not face compatibility issues.   66"
WCPFC15,402,"Vanuatu, on behalf of FFA members, supported the endorsement of the report and its outcomes, and suggested the working group next meet in 2020, consistent with the previous 2-year spacing of meetings, which would allow some important related work to be undertaken, such as Project 93."
WCPFC15,403,"Korea thanked the ERandEMWG Chair, Kerry Smith (Australia), for her hard work. It noted that E-Monitoring could be a useful tool, and detailed some of the progress Korea was making at the national level on E-Reporting and E-Monitoring. Korea supported endorsement of the report."
WCPFC15,404,"FSM, on behalf of the PNA, supported the statement made by Vanuatu and FFA members. The PNA thanked the working group chair for her efforts and the WCPFC Secretariat for the support they provided. They looked forward to contributing to the comprehensive data review proposed by the working group and now included in the SC draft workplan. PNA ministers have directed the development of a PNA Electronic Monitoring Program, which was reinforced by the recent call by the President of FSM to have all longline vessels subject to electronic monitoring by the year 2023. Building on the results of several trials of E-Monitoring technology on longliners in PNA waters, PNA members have started work with The Nature Conservancy on developing a PNA Electronic Monitoring Program. PNA members stated they that look forward to working with other CCMs in this important area, particularly to improve monitoring and scientific data collection on high seas distant water longliners. Update or revision of E-reporting SSPs"
WCPFC15,405,"The Commission agreed with respect to maintaining adopted standards, matters of substance (such as major changes or new proposals) shall be considered in a manner consistent with already established processes for new proposals. The Secretariat shall administer minor changes to the SSPs that reflect decisions of the Commission by circulating a draft to all CCMs advising that the change had been made and would come into effect on a date at least consistent with that in the SSPs. CCMs shall be provided the opportunity to raise concerns and if so, the change becomes a matter of substance and will be handled as such. Standards for E-reporting of high seas transhipment"
WCPFC15,406,"The Commission adopted the E-Reporting Standards for transhipment declarations and transhipment notices (WCPFC-2018-ERandEMWG03-03 Attachment 1, Attachment S)."
WCPFC15,407,"The Commission agreed that where transhipment declarations and transhipment notices are submitted to WCPFC in accordance with the E-Reporting Standards for transhipment declarations and transhipment notices, the following information will not be required: a. the observers signature;  b. a unique document identifier;   c. for the offloading vessel to supply data on the quantity of product already on board the receiving vessel;  d. for the receiving vessel to supply data on the fishing gear that the offloading vessel used to take the fish; and  e. for the receiving vessel to supply data on the quantity of product to be transhipped."
WCPFC15,408,The Commission also agreed to   67    a. add a footnote to Annex I of CMM 2009-06 that says “CCMs shall submit information required in Annex I or in accordance with E-reporting Standards for transhipment declarations and transhipment notices”; and b. add a footnote to Annex III of CMM 2009-06 that says “CCMs shall submit information required in Annex III or in accordance with E-reporting Standards for transhipment declarations and transhipment notices E-monitoring concept paper
WCPFC15,409,The Commission agreed to prioritising E-monitoring in areas where independent data collection and verification is currently low and asked SC15 and TCC15 for advice on priority areas.
WCPFC15,410,"The Commission supported the continuation of intersessional work, led by the ERandEMWG Chair Kerry Smith (Australia) to further develop a draft conservation and management measure on E-monitoring for consideration by the Commission in 2020.  The ERandEMWG Chair was tasked to provide a report on progress to WCPFC16 in 2019.   ERandEMWG3 Report"
WCPFC15,411,The Commission adopted the ERandEMWG3 Summary Report (WCPFC15-2018-ERandEMWG3).   AGENDA ITEM 10  —  COMPLIANCE MONITORING SCHEME  10.1 Consideration and Adoption of the Final Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR)
WCPFC15,412,"The Commission considered the provisional CMR recommended by TCC14 through a small working group led by Alexa Cole (United States), the TCC Chair, which compiled the final CMR for adoption.  The TCC Chair provided a report on the SWG outcomes. The review of compliance by CCMs was undertaken against an updated priority list of Commission obligations agreed to at WCPFC14 for 2018, and in accordance with CMM 2017-07. The current CMS does not require an overall assessment of each CCM, but only asks WCPFC to identify a compliance assessment for each specific obligation. Some obligations were assessed by WCPFC15 as “CMM Review”. The CMS working group noted that in some cases, such as in relation to CMM 2016-01, the obligations in question have already been revised in CMM 2017-01, but encouraged the Commission to consider whether additional revision is needed to resolve the difficulties in assessment. WCPFC15 assessed the following obligations as CMM Review: CMM 2014-02, para 4; and CMM 2016-01, paras 14, 16 and 18. There were two obligations that WCPFC15 was not able to assess due to a lack of consensus as to the compliance status. Therefore, the following obligations were not assessed: CMM 2016-04, para 3(2) (Japan, relating to a difference of opinion on the management period and associated reporting for the measure) and CMM 2016-01, para 22 (Philippines)."
WCPFC15,413,Commission members and the Commission Chair expressed their appreciation to Alexa Cole for her work in chairing TCC.
WCPFC15,414,"The Commission adopted the 2018 Final Compliance Monitoring Report (covering 2017 activities) (WCPFC15-2018-finalCMR, Attachment T).   68    10.2 Review of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme  10.2.1 Report from the independent panel to review the Compliance Monitoring Scheme"
WCPFC15,415,"The Chair stated that WCPFC15-2018-26: Report from the independent panel to review the Compliance Monitoring Scheme was considered by the CMS IWG, as discussed in WCPFC15-2018-27A, and highlighted by the CMS IWG Chair under Agenda Item 10.2.2."
WCPFC15,416,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the Review Panel for their comprehensive and valuable report that incorporated FFA members’ views. FFA members had reviewed the recommendations and recognised several of these in development of the FFA proposal on the draft CMS measure. As stated at TCC14, while the priority task for FFA members is development of the measure, some recommendations are distinct from the measure and it would be useful to progress these to support the CMS process and the broader work of the Commission. These relate to continued development of the Commission’s IMS to support implementation of the CMS and support MCS activities; continued development of training resources and learning aids for the IMS; and options to mitigate the impacts of unscheduled disruption to the Secretariat and trends analyses of capacity development information. These were discussed in the context of the revised TCC workplan and FFA members strongly recommended they be included in the workplan."
WCPFC15,417,The Chair noted that members should draw on the report’s recommendations. She expressed gratitude to the three members of the review panel for considering a very large body of work that should serve as a guide.
WCPFC15,418,"The Commission noted the Report from the Independent Panel to review the Compliance Monitoring Scheme and agreed that the recommendations therein would serve as a reference for the Commissions consideration of future work to enhance the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (WCPFC15-2018-26).    10.2.2 Report of the CMS-IWG, including Proposal for a CMM for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme"
WCPFC15,419,The Commission considered the following papers related to the CMS: WCPFC15-2018-27A: Summary of CMS IWG comments on the report from the independent review of the CMS; WCPFC15-2018-27B: Compilation of CMS IWG comments on the “Draft list of principles document”; and WCPFC15-2018-DP11_rev1: Comments on the working draft text for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme - revision 1.
WCPFC15,420,"Mr Glen Joseph (RMI), as CMS-IWG Chair noted that the IWG was established at WCPFC14 to undertake two tasks: (i) to consider the report from the Independent Panel on the Review of the CMS (WCPFC15-2018-26), and (ii) to develop a proposed conservation and management measure for the CMS for consideration at WCPFC15. A summary of the views of the CMS-IWG on the Independent Panel report is contained in WCPFC15-2018-27A. The development of the proposed CMM for the CMS was progressed through submission of draft text from members, including a consolidated draft from FFA, and discussed at an informal meeting held in conjunction with SC14. A face-to-face meeting of the IWG was financially supported by New Zealand and was convened immediately prior to TCC14. Further work produced WCPFC15-2018-CMS IWG: Review of the WCPFC Compliance Monitoring Scheme — CMS IWG Working Draft Text – revision 3. The CMS-IWG welcomed further development of the proposal through the CMS SWG during WCPFC15.   69"
WCPFC15,421,"Following further work, Glen Joseph (RMI) as the CMS SWG Chair, presented the sixth working draft. Members expressed support for the proposal, and the TCC Chair noted that it was a strong measure that would support the CMS. CCMs also acknowledged the efforts of the CMS-IWG Chair and all Commission members for engaging in a spirit of compromise and cooperation."
WCPFC15,422,"FSM, on behalf of FFA members, stated that various areas of future work were contemplated by the proposed CMS measure: (i) the development of a risk-based framework to inform compliance assessments; (ii) the development of audit points for assessing CCMs' compliance with obligations; and (iii) a comprehensive review of the Commission's reporting requirements. They noted the work has been generally considered by FAC, with budgetary allocations made for CMS work. Two of these work areas have also been specifically included in the TCC Workplan. They noted the need to finalise any terms of reference for the work and suggested these be developed based on the draft terms of reference submitted by FFA in WCPFC15-2018-DP11_rev 1: Comments on the working draft text for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme. FSM also thanked the United States for its cooperation and engagement in developing the measure."
WCPFC15,423,"The United States stated some of the future work identified in the new CMS CMM could be accomplished by Members without additional resource implications. In particular, the United States stated it would be happy to engage with other interested CCMs intersessionally on the development of audit points."
WCPFC15,424,"The Commission adopted CMM 2018-07 Conservation and Management Measure for Compliance Monitoring Scheme (WCPFC15-2018-CMS IWG_04, Attachment U)."
WCPFC15,425,"The Commission noted that the measure includes an ambitious workplan for 2019 and that FAC had allocated some budgetary resources to support this work.  The Commission welcomed the expressions of interest from some Members to work with other Members during the intersessional period in 2019, to develop draft audit points for the assessment of obligations through the Compliance Monitoring Scheme."
WCPFC15,426,The Commission agreed that the list of obligations to be assessed in 2019 through the Compliance Monitoring Scheme should be based on the approved list from 2018 (Attachment V).     AGENDA ITEM 11  — ADOPTION OF THE 2019 IUU VESSEL LIST
WCPFC15,427," The Chair introduced WCPFC15-2018-28: WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2019, which presented for the consideration of WCPFC15 the relevant information for a decision on the 2019 WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC15,428,The Commission adopted the 2019 WCPFC IUU Vessel List (Attachment W).
WCPFC15,429,"The Commission tasked the Executive Director to: a. seek the former flag CCM’s or non-CCM’s cooperation to provide any information on these vessels, including their respective master’s names and nationalities; b. write to all CCMs to provide information to the Commission if the vessels on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List are located, or if there are any known changes to name, flag or registered owner,  70    including any action that port states have taken such as denial of port entry and services to those vessels or any information from cannery State of any landings made by these vessels;  c. write a letter to other RFMOs and other relevant bodies conveying this same message for cooperation to locate these vessels; and  d. promptly reported any information received to CCMs.   AGENDA ITEM 12  — REPORT OF THE TWELFTH ANNUAL SESSION OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE  12.1 Report of the Twelfth Finance and Administration Committee"
WCPFC15,430,"The Commission considered the report of FAC12 (WCPFC15-2018-FAC12-14). The FAC co-Chair Magele Etuati Ropeti (Samoa) presented the FAC report, and thanked CCMs who participated in the FAC sessions held on the 9th, 12th, 13th and 14th of December. The main recommendations included: that a supplementary retirement plan for locally engaged staff be implemented in 2019; support for the Secretariat’s efforts to develop and implement an environmental policy; approval of the terms of reference and budget for a consultancy to undertake a building survey and develop a maintenance plan for the Commission buildings; and agreement to keep the SRF at a target base level of US$150,000, which is equivalent to ~2% of CCM contributions, to support implementation of the SIP and other needs as identified by developing States parties."
WCPFC15,431,"Australia stated that FFA members requested that US$100,000 amount be set aside in a dedicated line item in the TCC budget for future CMS work. The Chair confirmed that this would be done by the Secretariat."
WCPFC15,432,"PNG inquired whether the observer budget for cross endorsements had an allocation to include cost recovery in the future. The Secretariat stated that cost recovery had been discussed, but the Secretariat had not considered this as a tasking for the next session of the FAC. RMI expressed agreement with PNG and asked that the intention to arrange for full future cost recovery be indicated. The United States recalled that it had offered to fund this through voluntary contributions and stated it would like to see what funds it could arrange to help continue the training. The United States proposed that the issue and any suggestions regarding cost recovery be raised at FAC13.   12.2 Budget Approval for 2019 and Indicative Budgets for 2020 and 2021"
WCPFC15,433,"The Commission adopted the report of the Twelfth Session of the FAC (WCPFC15-2018-FAC12), including the 2019 budget of $8,041,652 and indicative budgets for 2020 and 2021 of $7,966,937 and $8,092,140, respectively (Attachments X)."
WCPFC15,434,"The Commission agreed that a new row should be included in Part 2.3 titled “CMS Future Work” with an amount of $100,000 in 2019, that is transferred from Sub-Item 2.3 “Information Management System” in 2019.  Note 6 should also be shifted to be notation for the “CMS Future Work” budget line."
WCPFC15,435,The final adopted 2019 budget and Annexes are provided in (Attachment Y).     71    AGENDA ITEM 13  — ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS  13.1 Corporate Plan
WCPFC15,436,"The Executive Director introduced WCPFC15-2018-29: Draft medium-term corporate plan, as required by WCPFC14. He explained that in 2016 and 2017, the Commission was engaged in developing a new long-term planning framework, and an annual short-term planning document. Following significant work, at WCPFC14 the Commission was unable to agree on a way forward for the strategic plan, so decided on a medium-term corporate plan. But when it agreed on the tasking, the Commission provided little instruction in terms of process and key objectives, and no budget for its development. The draft Corporate Plan in WCPFC15-2018-29 is the Secretariat’s best effort to provide a framework to assist the Commission and the Secretariat in organizing its work. In the absence of consultations with members, the Secretariat relied on the materials gathered during the consultations with members and stakeholders in 2016 when developing the draft Strategic Plan, as a reflection of some of the views and perspectives of Commission members and stakeholders. Accordingly, the goals and guiding objectives for the Medium-Term Corporate Plan were adapted and are refinements of those in the draft Strategic Plan. The plan is an organic and living document, subject to regular renewal and refreshment. A short-term consultancy was involved. The Executive Director noted he was seeking guidance on the process to further progress development of the plan, which needs to benefit from input from stakeholders and members. He stated he was encouraged that FAC sought to develop terms of reference for that process."
WCPFC15,437,"The EU suggested holding consultations intersessionally, and noted it was important to consider the cost implications of the plan. It suggested that regarding Goal 6 of the plan (Enhance the transparency and effectiveness of Commission governance and operations) the EU would like to have language added to ensure that relevant aspects of UNCLOS and the UN FSA are implemented, with provisions that apply to WCPFC applied through the Commission’s daily work."
WCPFC15,438,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, noted with concern that the matter had been before the annual meeting for the past two sessions without substantive progress.  They stated their concern to ensure the agenda item was not subject to prolonged discussion with little real value. They stated their view that there were two options: a.        Abandon the Corporate Plan, and continue to run the Commission on a year-to-year basis as necessary to implement the Convention, its CMMs, and any subsidiary body workplans formally adopted by the Commission (this is not an ideal option); and b.       Task the WCPFC Secretariat to work with members to refine a draft Corporate Plan focusing on the Secretariat, and bring it back to WCPFC16 next year for adoption. FFA members’ view is that the Commission needs to provide guidance to the Secretariat on how to progress development of the Plan, and that FFA members see clear value in having a Corporate Plan focussing on the work of the Secretariat. In an effort to progress the issue, a number of members developed draft terms of reference for the development of a Corporate Plan for the Secretariat (WCPFC15-2018-FAC12-13). FAC received the report positively but there has been no opportunity to seek more formal agreement on the terms of reference. However, FFA members consider there is a need for a Corporate Plan for the Secretariat, developed in consultation with Members."
WCPFC15,439,"Noting that some members needed further time to consider the terms of reference, the Commission agreed to request that the Executive Director should continue to progress the draft intersessionally during 2019.  72"
WCPFC15,440,"The Commission directed the Executive Director to progress, intersessionally with interested CCMs, the further development of the draft Medium-Term Corporate Plan (WCPFC15-2018-29) to guide the work of the Secretariat and to report back to WCPFC16.  13.2 Kobe Process"
WCPFC15,441,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC15-2018-30: Kobe Process, which includes (as Attachment A) a concept note from the Chair of the Steering Committee of the Kobe process, which last met in in July in the margins of the meeting of the FAO Committee on Fisheries. The Executive Director noted that the Chair of the Steering Committee was present at WCPFC15. The Executive Director provided a background on the Kobe Process, which is intended to provide a platform for cooperation among the five tuna RFMOs."
WCPFC15,442,"The Chair of the Kobe Process Steering Committee stated that cooperation between RFMOs was useful where common challenges exist, where cooperation can be beneficial, and where such cooperation does not impinge on autonomy. He briefly reviewed the history of the Kobe Process, and the current effort to determine the correct format, scale and focus for cooperation. He stated the Concept Note proposed three main categories: (i) cooperation, exchange of information and coordination among RFMO secretariats (members of the Kobe Process steering committee); (ii) organisation of meetings of existing or new working groups covering specific topics (e.g., FADs, MSE, and bycatch), with open participation and voluntary contributions; and (iii) organisation of new large-scale meetings, which he noted could only work if properly prepared, and which are accompanied by many reservations. He encouraged members to discuss the options, and asked the Commission to allow the Chair and Executive Director to work further on these issues."
WCPFC15,443,"Japan stated that it had indicated at meetings of other RFMOs where it is a member that Japan very much supported cooperation among RFMOs, and the organisation of small and medium-sized meetings that focus on specific themes, such as MSE, which is a very new and emerging issue. It expressed reservations regarding large-scale meetings that inevitably cover a wide range of issues, including some that are very controversial, and noted the severe conflicts that develop in those settings were not helpful."
WCPFC15,444,"Tokelau, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the members of the Steering Committee of the Kobe Process for bringing forward some suggestions regarding the future work of the tuna RFMOs. They noted FFA members have always recognised the potential benefits of a process that allows the tuna RFMOs to learn from each other's successes by facilitating better information sharing and cooperation. However, they stated they were also very aware of the risks that the global process can pose for FFA members. They stated they have worked hard in the WCPFC to establish management frameworks that recognise the sovereign rights and aspirations of the SIDS in the Pacific, in whose EEZs the vast majority of WCPO catch is taken. They stated they are wary of any process that could undermine the progress made in the region, and stated that unfortunately, the earlier Kobe process did exactly that. They also raised the issue of the cost of engaging in additional processes on top of the already congested schedule of regional meetings and deadlines. They stated they had yet to be convinced that the potential benefits of reinvigorating the Kobe process will outweigh the costs."
WCPFC15,445,"Canada stated it did not participate in the earlier high-level sessions of the Kobe Process, and understood the current smaller-scale meetings seemed to have good results. It noted that it was unfortunate it was being raised at the conclusion of WCPFC15 and stated it did not fully understand the concerns of FFA members. Canada noted the issue was to how to make the process work better, and suggested that sharing specific practices and experiences (e.g., on managing transhipment at sea) could  73    be very useful among tuna RFMOs. Canada supported involvement in the Kobe process, while expressing reluctance regarding high-level meetings."
WCPFC15,446,"The EU thanked the presenters, noting the Kobe Process is important, and creates synergies and enhances complementarities between RFMOs. It suggested the process offered only benefits to members. Based on the Concept Note, the EU suggested meetings and working groups offered the most value in the short and medium term. It expressed regret that the WCPFC was not represented in the 2018 Tuna RFMO FAD working group meeting, and stated this was an essential subject for WCPFC members. The EU expressed less interest in the large-scale meetings, but said they may be useful at some time. It saw no risks for any members of the WCPFC in participation, noting that the rights of coastal states were not discussed at the level being proposed, and that the Kobe Process could in any case only reinforce these rights. Furthermore, the EU stated that issues could be addressed in a manner to support developing states throughout the different RFMOs, which offered benefits and synergies rather than risks."
WCPFC15,447,"The United States stated it would be most interested in working group meetings, which provide an opportunity for technical cooperation. It stated it would like to see support from all RFMOs."
WCPFC15,448,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, stated they could support ongoing meetings of the steering committee, if these were restricted to the Chairs and directors of the tuna RFMOs, and if they developed suggestions for areas of work where coordination and cooperation across the tuna RFMOs could lead to tangible outcomes. It does not support proposals for large global omnibus meetings of all tuna RFMO members as seen under previous iterations of the Kobe Process. Australia asked that the WCPFC Executive Director communicate this position when discussing the potential viability of reigniting the Kobe Process, either in the Kobe Steering Committee or in other forums such as the network of Regional Fisheries Bodies."
WCPFC15,449,The EU requested that WCPFC be represented at the 2019 Tuna RFMO FAD working group meeting.
WCPFC15,450,The Commission noted the update on the Kobe Process (WCPFC15-2018-30).
WCPFC15,451,"The Commission supported continued involvement by the Commission Chair and the Executive Director in meetings of the Kobe Process Steering Committee, and the participation in a 2019 meeting of the joint tuna RFMO FAD Working Group by the WCPFC FAD-IWG Chair and a member of the WCPFC Secretariat.   13.3 Research Projects  13.3.1 ABNJ Project"
WCPFC15,452,"Janne Fogelgren (FAO ABNJ Tuna Project) introduced WCPFC15-2018-31: Report to WCPFC on Progress of the Project Sustainable Management of Tuna Fisheries and Biodiversity Conservation in the ABNJ. He thanked FAO’s partners in the region (WCPFC, FFA, SPC, IATTC, and the government of Fiji), as well as ISSF, WWF and Birdlife International for their collaboration. FAO highlighted the large, successful electronic monitoring and surveillance program in Fiji, involving over 50 vessels, and a new project (to begin in 2019) in conjunction with ISSF to provide training and undertake trials on biodegradable FADs in the WCPO.  They also noted the possible interest from The Global Environment Facility (GEF) in supporting a follow-up ABNJ project.   74"
WCPFC15,453,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, acknowledged many of the good outcomes of the various ABNJ tuna projects, particularly in the areas of bycatch mitigation and data improvement. They supported the proposed extension of the Common Oceans project through December 2019 and the associated work programme. Regarding the proposed Phase 2 of the ABNJ Project, FFA members stressed the need for any project development to be consistent with, and support, the WCPFC’s priorities. They noted with disappointment that a Phase 2 planning meeting was scheduled at the same time as WCPFC15. They stated it was critical that the Commission was meaningfully engaged with the project coordinators to ensure that the WCPFC and the priorities of its CCMs are taken into account."
WCPFC15,454,"The EU supported the continuation of the project, and noted its contributions, especially in the area of bycatch mitigation. It also acknowledged the commitment and quality of the work of the coordinator of the project, Dr S. Clark, that have been instrumental in achieving the key objectives of the first phase of the project and allowing WCPFC to be a leading RFMO in terms of conservation and management of by catch species"
WCPFC15,455,"Nauru on behalf of the PNA, fully supported the statement made by New Zealand on behalf of FFA members that any future ABNJ project must support rather than drive the objectives of WCPFC SIDS.  They stated that while the ABNJ project has provided valuable input in many areas, it has also introduced some anomalies, such as the huge amount of time spent on shark and other bycatch issues at SC. Any future ABNJ project must be mindful of GEF’s purpose, which is to assist developing countries and countries with economies in transition to achieve environmental outcomes and fulfil their international obligations. The purpose of GEF is not simply to supplement RFMO funding. They stated that the ABNJ project has delivered a range of benefits to WCPFC SIDS, but has also invested in a wide range of activities that are very loosely related to that overall purpose. They noted they will convey these views throughout the design phase, but requested that the Executive Director and all CCMs also be mindful of this when the design team conducts its consultation."
WCPFC15,456,"The United States echoed the sentiments expressed by other members, and noted it appreciated the hard work done by the project and encouraged the Secretariat to work with ABNJ in the design of a phase 2."
WCPFC15,457,The Commission noted the updates on Progress of the Project Sustainable Management of Tuna Fisheries and Biodiversity Conservation in the ABNJ (WCPFC15-2018-31).  13.3.2 Pacific Tuna Tagging Project
WCPFC15,458,"J. Hampton (SPC) introduced WCPFC15-2018-32: Pacific Tuna Tagging Programme, noting that the programme remains an important part of the Commission’s science programme, and undertakes tuna tagging cruises each year. In 2018 the programme targeted bigeye tuna in the western tropical Pacific, and in 2019 the focus will be on skipjack within the warm pool. He noted the cooperation from many CCMs, including in assisting with the complex task of tag recovery, and noted in particular the observer programmes and fishery administrations that provide assistance with recovery."
WCPFC15,459,"Korea thanked SPC and the Secretariat and offered congratulations on the voyage conducted in 2017 targeting skipjack. Korea expressed its satisfaction that it could support the tagging program through voluntary contributions, which will continue through 2021."
WCPFC15,460,"RMI, on behalf of FFA members, thanked SPC for the report. They noted they had strongly supported the project at SC14, and value it highly because the tuna tagging data is becoming increasingly important in reducing the uncertainty in tropical assessments, and in providing an index of abundance  75    for the most valuable stock in the region, as well as helping with ageing, and migration and connectivity studies."
WCPFC15,461,The Commission noted the updates on the Pacific Tuna Tagging Project (WCPFC15-2018-32).  13.3.3 WCPFC Tissue Bank – application of the Nagoya Protocol
WCPFC15,462,"J. Hampton (SPC) introduced WCPFC15-2018-33: Project 35b: WCPFC Tuna Tissue Bank, stating that it is an important science activity of the Commission that provides important biological inputs to the stock assessments. Implementation of the Nagoya protocol involves access to and sharing of genetic resources, and SPC, the Secretariat and the WCPFC Legal Adviser are working to assess any associated legal issues and will provide SC and the Commission with options to address any that arise."
WCPFC15,463,"Kiribati on behalf of FFA members, stated they supported Project 35b at SC14, including the recommendations to maintain and enhance the WCPFC Tissue Bank and its associated workplan and budget for 2019. They noted that the work is extremely important to many components of the Commission’s work, particularly regarding the improvement of stock assessments. In addition, they highlighted the valuable work being completed by CCMs’ observers and port samplers that are trained and tasked with collecting the biological samples, stating that their contribution is essential to the ongoing success of the Commission’s work."
WCPFC15,464,"The United States supported the suggestion to seek technical advice to better understand the issues associated with the tissue bank and stated it would be happy to engage with the Secretariat and SPC, possibly through SC, to ensure any concerns it had were addressed."
WCPFC15,465,The Commission noted the updates on Project 35b: WCPFC Tuna Tissue Bank (WCPFC15-2018-33).  13.3.4 WPEA Project
WCPFC15,466,"Dr SungKwon Soh (WCPFC Science Manager) introduced WCPFC15-2018-34: Update on the WPEA Project, which is active in Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam. The project will be completed in April 2019.  The third phase WPEA project (Western Pacific East Asia Improved Tuna Monitoring Activity) funded by New Zealand is expected to be fully implemented in 2019 and scheduled for completion in 2022. Key activities of the current WPEA project include: a) collection of tuna catch data and estimation of national annual tuna catch by species and by gear; b) capacity building in science; c) development of guidelines on adaptive management and monitoring of HMS to address climate change; d) market-based sustainability, including characterizing tuna supply chain in each country and establishing certification/eco-labeling systems; e) development of reference points and harvest control rules at national level; f) application of an EAFM to selected tuna fisheries; g) updating of national tuna management plans, and national tuna fishery profiles; and  h) review of legal, policy and institutional arrangements in line with WCPFC requirements.  76"
WCPFC15,467,"Tuvalu, on behalf of FFA members, stated that the WPEA project has provided the Commission with very valuable data on previously unavailable catch landings in Indonesia, Philippines and Viet Nam. They noted the project is now entering its third iteration with funding from New Zealand after two cycles of support under the GEF International Waters Initiative, and that data from this project is crucial to the ongoing refinement of stock assessment models prepared by SPC. They also noted a need to continue to improve data collection, especially in artisanal fisheries, and asked the countries involved to further enhance and resource this project."
WCPFC15,468,"Indonesia thanked WCPFC for supporting the project, noting the positive outcomes, both for Indonesia and other countries. It noted the development of a tuna management plan and harvest strategy work in its waters that will be compatible with the harvest strategy being developed for the WCPO. Indonesia also noted outputs in progress, and the increase in the capacity of its scientists and managers. Indonesia acknowledged the support from New Zealand for the third phase of the project."
WCPFC15,469,"The Philippines thanked the Commission, UNDP, SPC and the Secretariat for their support through the project. The Philippines looked forward to continuing cooperation with the Commission, and thanked New Zealand for its support."
WCPFC15,470,"Viet Nam stated that it was happy to be present and able to express its thanks to WCPFC for its help in implementing the project, stating its fisheries management has improved and the project helped in revising Viet Nam’s fisheries law. The project also helped build capacity to collect fishery data and increase capacity in fisheries management. Viet Nam signalled its readiness to implement the project funded by New Zealand, which was just approved by its government. Viet Nam reiterated their interest in being a full member of WCPFC in the future."
WCPFC15,471,The Commission noted the updates on the WPEA Project (WCPFC15-2018-34).  13.4 Election of Officers

They also congratulated the Vice-Chair on being confirmed as Chair beginning in 2019."
WCPFC15,484,"The Executive Director voiced his gratitude for the Chair’s leadership and guidance in the work of the Commission, noting that in his various roles in many Pacific organisations he had never worked with a Chair who was as engaging, inspiring and easy to work with. He thanked the Chair for being a tremendous leader and a good friend to the Secretariat, and assured the incoming Chair that the Secretariat would offer her the same support and cooperation."
WCPFC15,485,"The Chair said that to call 2018 a busy year would be an understatement, but observed WCPFC15 was finishing before midnight. She thanked members for working through long days and late into the night, and for making good progress and delivering good outcomes to the Commission. She noted that it was a testimony to how important the Commission is, and why participants do the work. The Chair thanked the United States and Hawaii for welcoming the Commission to Honolulu, and expressed the hope that members would have the opportunity to enjoy Honolulu before returning home. She noted the lack of agreement on the harvest strategy dialogue and a consolidated sharks measure, but said that engagement on these issues would continue until agreement is reached. She noted the excellent progress on many other issues, including adopting a strong tropical tuna measure and other important CMMs, including a TRP for South Pacific albacore. She congratulated all CCMs for their hard work that culminated in these outcomes. She thanked CCMs for their warm appreciation, and the Executive Director and the Secretariat staff, as well as SPC, for their excellent support. She wished everyone success and expressed her full confidence in the incoming Chair."

WCPFC16,9,"The WCPFC Executive Director, Feleti P Teo, OBE in his welcoming remarks welcomed participants to the opening ceremony of WCPFC16. He extended, on behalf of the WCPFC and all delegates, appreciation and gratitude for the attendance at the meeting of the Honourable James Marape, Prime Minister of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea and looked forward to the prime Minister’s address and insights. The Executive Director thanked the government and people of PNG for the warmth of their welcome and for hosting WCPFC16, and acknowledged with gratitude PNG’s Minister for Fisheries, the Hon. Dr. Lino Tom and his officials and staff for the excellent meeting arrangements. He also acknowledged the presence of other ministers of fisheries from member states of the Commission, particularly Pacific Island developing states, and noted that their continued attendance was sending a powerful message regarding the serious concern of Pacific Island states regarding the health and sustainability of tuna and other highly migratory fish stocks in the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO). He further noted that the Pacific has the world’s richest tuna resources and production, contributing over half of global tuna catch in 2018. He also highlighted that all the key commercial tuna stocks in the WCPF Convention Area are assessed as being managed and maintained above agreed sustainable levels, an accomplishment not matched in any other region. He cautioned, however, that there was a temptation to be complacent and less vigilant with regard to conservation efforts, and reminded CCMs that the WCPFC is first and foremost a conservation organisation, which must have as its central focus the biological sustainability of the fish stocks, with all other considerations and interests — whether financial, economic or commercial — remaining subservient to that central focus. The Executive Director’s full remarks are attached as Attachment B."
WCPFC16,10,"The Commission Chair, Ms. Jung-re Riley Kim, welcomed the Prime Minister of PNG, as well as honourable ministers, delegates, representatives, and attendees to WCPFC16. She expressed her gratitude to the government of PNG, remarking on the professionalism and efficiency which the government of PNG had demonstrated as host of the WCPFC. She also remarked in particular the significance of the attendance by the Prime Minister of PNG at the opening of WCPFC16. She stated her immense pleasure and honour to lead the discussions that would contribute to shaping the future of resource conservation and management in the WCPO. The Chair noted that critical issues facing WCPFC16 included making further progress on harvest strategies; improving the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS), which is set to expire in 2019; discussing and producing a workplan to develop high seas purse seine catch or effort limits and longline bigeye limits and relevant allocations as set out in the WCPFC’s tropical tuna measure; and discussing ways to ensure effective conservation and management of South Pacific albacore. She drew particular attention to the harvest strategy, which is a core objective of the Commission, and stated that WCPFC15 agreed on a 6-day annual meeting for WCPFC16 to enable the Commission to move forward with discussions and development of a harvest strategy in accordance with Conservation and Management Measure (CMM) 2014-06, and noted her expectation that WCPFC16 would make meaningful progress in that regard. She highlighted the significant contribution by SPC-OFP in providing science and data inputs into this work, and their innovative efforts and initiatives for engaging with and building the capacity of CCMs with respect to harvest strategies. She also noted the importance of giving consideration to the special requirements of small island developing states (SIDS) and appreciated the efforts by all CCMs to uphold this important principle. The Chair offered special thanks to the Executive Director and his team for their support in preparation for WCPFC16; and thanked the Commission Vice Chair, and chairs and vice chairs of the subsidiary bodies of the Commission for their hard work and leadership. She also offered congratulations to FFA members on their 40th anniversary. The Chair closed by expressing thanks and acknowledgement to WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  3    the former WCPFC Chair Ms. Rhea Moss-Christian, who she said led the Commission with dedication, focus and stewardship; the Chair emphasized her intention to carry on that legacy. The WCPFC Chair’s full remarks are attached as Attachment C."
WCPFC16,11,"The Honourable James Marape, MP, Prime Minister of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, gave the keynote opening address. On behalf of his government and the people of PNG he extended a very warm welcome to his country, which he noted is a land of many cultures, tradition and languages, with over 8 million people, 800 languages and 1000 tribes. He observed that PNG was not new to United Nations (UN) processes, recalling that PNG hosted a PrepCom conference in Madang preceding the first WCPFC conference. He recalled the importance of UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 and the declaration by Pacific Island Forum Leaders of a Blue Pacific, in recognition of the region’s shared stewardship of the Pacific. He observed that the WCPO contains the world’s most productive tuna fisheries, which are unique in that they occur mostly under national jurisdiction, largely within the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of Pacific SIDS, where about half of the global supply of skipjack is caught. He highlighted that there are issues and challenges affecting the sustainability of tuna and other highly migratory stocks in the WCPO, noting in particular illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, with its far-reaching consequences for long-term sustainable fisheries management. Among the other pressing issues facing WCPFC16 he mentioned the need to develop harvest strategies for key commercial tuna species; controlling high seas fishing effort and transhipment; the special requirements for SIDS; and an effective CMS. However, he observed WCPFC’s actions have helped ensure that all major tuna stocks in the WCPF Convention Area are currently at sustainable levels, which is not the case in any other regional fisheries management organization (RFMO). He stated the need for all CCMs to work together in true partnership to ensure WCPFC’s fish stocks remain healthy, noting PNG’s commitment in that endeavour, and his government’s vision to encourage growth through onshore and downstream processing in the fisheries sector in the region, providing jobs, livelihoods, foreign exchange and food security, with the goal of seeing the region recognized in the global market as the home of sustainable fishing and catch. He also called upon WCPFC to address climate change and its impact on the low-lying islands of the Pacific, its waters, and fish stocks; the growing impacts of pollution from plastics and marine debris; harmful fisheries subsidies that impacting fragile Pacific economies; and social accountability standards for those employed be fisheries. He stated that such issues are real for Pacific peoples, and they must be properly managed. He expressed confidence that WCPFC’s deliberations would strengthen existing measures and reach consensus on adoption of new CMMs, noting the reality that the Pacific islands could not move on to new regions if they soiled their resources. He wished participants success in their deliberations and declared the 16th Annual Regular Session of the WCPFC open. The Prime Minister’s full remarks are attached as Attachment D.  1.1 Adoption of Agenda"
WCPFC16,12,The Chair presented the revised Provisional Agenda (WCPFC16-2019-01) for consideration and adoption of the Commission. She noted the addition of agenda Item
WCPFC16,14,"The Hon. Semi Koroilavesau, Minister for Fisheries of Fiji, acknowledged the Prime Minister of PNG for his address, and gave tribute to the traditional owners of Papua New Guinea for their hospitality. He stressed that the shared ocean and its resources formed an identity that had sustained Pacific Islanders for generations, and that Fiji and its Pacific Island neighbours were thus passionate about voicing their concerns during WCPFC meetings. He reviewed several items of concern to Fiji:  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  4    i. Finalising the preferred South Pacific albacore target reference point (TRP), with a focus on an overall hard limit split between the high seas and EEZs, and implementing overall hard limits that recognise zone-based management, EEZ limits, data collection and reporting requirements until a harvest strategy is agreed upon;  ii. Developing control measures on effort in the high seas through limits and an allocation framework for purse seine and longline fisheries;  iii. Improving current coverage and more effectively implementing broader monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) priorities; iv. Recognising the adverse impacts of climate change in the WCPO, and collectively taking stronger action on climate change in the form of better science, robust measures that help mitigate impacts of climate change, and a general reduction of the WCPFC’s carbon footprint; and  v. Recognising the limitations of SIDS and what needs to be undertaken to ensure that CMMs are not burdensome and are passed through consensus."
WCPFC16,15,"The Hon. Dennis P. Momotaro, Minister of Natural Resources and Commerce, and Chairman of the Marshall Islands Marine Resources Authority, expressed gratitude for the excellent hosting of the meetings, and for the Prime Minister’s address. He also congratulated the WCPFC Chair for her new role, and acknowledged the prior Chair, Ms. Rhea Moss-Christian. He addressed three key issues, in addition to supporting the comments raised by Fiji:  i. the ongoing challenges of IUU fishing, and work toward achieving an IUU-free Pacific by 2023; ii. the immediate need to address marine pollution through effective implementation of CMM 2017-04; and iii. the response to the impacts of climate change, as expressed in WCPFC16-2019-DP04."
WCPFC16,16,"The Hon. Esa Sharon-Mona Ainu’u (Niue) wished the Chair all the best in her leadership; acknowledged the Vice Chair of WCPFC, Dr Josie Tamate, from Niue; and expressed appreciation and thanks to Ms. Rhea Moss Christian for her dedication and hard work during her term as Chair of WCPFC. She thanked the host government of PNG for the warm hospitality accorded to her delegation and stated that her presence was an indication of Niue’s continual commitment to the management and sustainable development of its vital fisheries. She stressed the responsibility CCMs have to ensure the tuna resources in the WCPO are managed sustainably. She noted three particular concerns Niue would focus on at WCPFC16:  i. Climate change, which she stated was an existential threat to the region, and directly threatens Pacific livelihoods, security and wellbeing. She stated that action on climate change needs to be a primary concern in all areas and called on WCPFC to adopt the FFA resolution that would be introduced;  ii. The need to agree and implement a process and workplan to establish limits and allocations for high seas purse seine and longline fisheries that specifically recognizes the special circumstances of SIDs, and the rights of SIDs to develop fisheries in the high seas; and iii. The South Pacific albacore roadmap, as albacore is the key species of interest for Niue’s EEZ.   She stated that she looked forward to cooperating with Niue’s regional partners to strengthen management of the high seas in order to cater for future generations."
WCPFC16,17,"The Hon. Lino Tom, Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources, PNG, welcomed all delegations to PNG, congratulated the Chair of WCPFC, and looked forward to working with her as chair. He noted that measures adopted by the Commission had resulted in demonstrated sustainable management of tuna and other highly migratory fish stocks in the WCPO, and that the Commission’s legacy was achieving cooperation between the competing interests of its various members. He mentioned some significant issues on the agenda, including high seas allocation, the harvest strategy, CMS, and climate change. He stated that the outcomes of the discussions should continue to strengthen and enhance existing management regimes, WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  5    in particular CMMs adopted for the high seas. He referenced the need to ensure that measures adopted did not have a disproportionate impact on SIDS and the need to adopt a skipjack TRP and noted with concern the approach being taken by the Commission regarding harvest strategies. He stressed the importance of addressing climate change, and of ensuring the need to comply with and be vigilant in maintaining the integrity of the Commission’s CMMs."
WCPFC16,18,"The Hon. Tetabo Nakara, Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources Development, Kiribati, offered warm gratitude to the government and people of PNG for hosting WCPFC16, and thanked the Secretariat and NFA for their support for WCPFC16. He acknowledged Commission members in recognizing Kiribati’s unfortunate situation with three non-contiguous EEZs across vast areas of high seas, and the accommodations made to Kiribati in recognition of this. He noted the dependence of Kiribati on the region’s shared tuna stocks and noted the need to honour and respect each other’s interest and sovereignty, in a spirit of good faith and cooperation. He noted that the success of the WCPFC’s CMMs was encouraging, while calling for more work on the science and economics of the fisheries to enable informed and active participation in decision-making. He also asked that developed CCMs recognise the Third Implementing Arrangement of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement, which he stated was embedded in the CMM for tropical tunas, and thus form part of the institutional structure of tuna management in the WCPO."
WCPFC16,19,"The Hon. Minute Alapati Taupo, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Fisheries and Trade of Tuvalu, thanked the government and people of PNG for the excellent hospitality and courtesy accorded to their delegation, and congratulated the Chair, while assuring her that his delegation would support and work with her in her tenure as chair of WCPFC. He also conveyed thanks and congratulations to the outgoing Chair, Ms Rhea Moss Christian. On behalf of the government of Tuvalu he noted the following priorities.  i. Climate change, which he described as threatening the very survival of Tuvalu. Tuvalu strongly supported the views expressed by FFA member countries in WCPFC16-2019-DP04, and urged WCPFC members to work towards effective and equitable solutions to address climate change impacts on the management of fisheries resources in this region;  ii. The review of the TRP for skipjack, which accounts for about 90% of the commercial tuna catches in Tuvalu’s waters. He noted Tuvalu favours a TRP that will maintain stocks and effort at or near 2012 levels. He also addressed the need to reach agreement on TRPs for yellowfin and bigeye, while suggesting a better understanding of the practical and economic impacts on Tuvalu’s multi-species fisheries was needed for setting TRPs for these tunas, observing that experience with the skipjack TRP also showed the need for caution;  iii. The process for setting limits for high seas purse seine and longline fisheries, while not re-opening the effective systems that PNA members have in place to manage the fisheries in their EEZs; and  iv. Concerns regarding the definition FADs. He noted that although Tuvalu would benefit from relaxing the FAD definition as proposed by two CCMs, it opposed it at WCPFC15 because of concerns over the impact on bigeye tuna stocks. Tuvalu also stated concern that the new exemption for “small items of garbage”, which was trialled in 2019, caused confusion for Tuvaluan observers. While always willing to consider measures to improve FAD management, Tuvalu was not inclined to agree to simply extend the arrangement.  He looked forward to further discussion on the issues before the Commission and stated his hope that CCMs could reach consensus. He closed by expressing sincere sympathies and condolences to the countries affected by the recent outbreak of measles which caused sad and unexpected casualties."
WCPFC16,20,"Mr. Eugene Pangelinan, Executive Director of FSM’s National Oceanic Resource Management Authority, and Chair of the Forum Fisheries Committee (FFC), spoke on behalf of the 17 members of FFA. He congratulated the Commission Chair, stating that she had the full support of the FFA membership, and again thanked the outgoing Chair, Ms. Rhea Moss-Christian for her past leadership. He thanked the PNG government for hosting the meeting and NFA for the excellent arrangements. He stated that at their 2019 WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  6    annual meeting Pacific Island Forum Leaders highlighted that climate change is the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the people of the Pacific, and reaffirmed their commitment to progress the implementation of the Paris Agreement. He stated that it is an unprecedented global challenge — the impacts of climate change are particularly severe in Pacific Island countries, where for many the threat posed by climate change is existential. He stated that climate change places the benefits to Pacific SIDS from the region’s tuna fisheries at great risk; for many countries, tuna fisheries are their most critical renewable resource, one that provides essential social, cultural and economic benefits, and tuna stocks are increasingly important for food security in the region and essential for the achievement of all SDGs by Pacific Island countries. He stated that as outlined in WCPFC16-2019-DP04, FFA members called on WCPFC to take stronger action on climate change, and that FFA members’ broader priorities for WCPFC16 were outlined in WCPFC16-2019-DP01 and other delegation papers. He closed by highlighting several other issues of concern to FFA members: i. The lack of thought in the CMM 2013-06 assessments on the impacts of new proposals on SIDS, noting the need for better advance consultation between proponents of measures and SIDS CCMs;  ii. The status of certain stocks, with North Pacific striped marlin being the most critical, noting that management of these stocks must be a priority; and iii. The need to resolve some longstanding issues, including the consolidated shark CMM."
WCPFC16,21,"France stated that their primary concern at WCPFC16 was the fight against IUU fishing, which requires continued improvement. It referred to enforcement actions taken by French authorities, stating that France will maintain the highest level of inspections possible near New Caledonia, French Polynesia, and Wallis and Futuna. France looked forward to efforts to increase Port State control and strengthen CMM 2017-02 (Conservation and Management Measure on Minimum Standards for Port State Measures). As of 1 January 2020, France stated it will apply the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Port State measures in Papeete. France stated it would support adoption of a CMM ensuring transhipment is conducted in port instead of at sea, and supported cooperation with other tuna (t)-RFMOs, especially with regard to inspections at sea and in port."
WCPFC16,22,"Mr. Va’amua Henry Sesepasara, Director of the Department of Marine and Wildlife Resources in American Samoa stated that, like Fiji, American Samoa identifies very closely with tuna — its culture and economy are tuna dependent, and American Samoa therefore supports the effective management of the tuna resources under the stewardship of the Commission. He looked forward to discussing all of the potentially contentious management issues such as high seas allocations, TRPs and harvest strategies, reflecting that, thanks to the good work of the Commission, tropical tunas in the WCPO are in good condition, but observed that the same cannot be said for tuna-dependent economies. He stated that there was simply too much tuna being caught, and the oversupply of purse seine-caught tuna had reduced the value of tuna for canning, noting that the current tuna fishery was simply not economically sustainable for any CCM. Therefore, like the albacore fishery, American Samoa believed economic considerations should be included when developing management measures for the purse seine tuna fishery. 1.3 Meeting Arrangements"
WCPFC16,23,"The Commission reviewed the meeting arrangements, the indicative meeting schedule, and confirmed decisions made at the Heads of Delegation meeting held on 4 December.  1.3.1 Establishment of small working groups"
WCPFC16,24," The Commission agreed to progress work on specific issues through the following small working groups: (i) CNM SWG, led by Nauru; (ii) SWG to finalise the CMR, led by the TCC Chair (RMI); (iii) , SWG to consider the E-Monitoring Concept Paper, led by ERandEM WG  Chair (Australia); (iv) Review WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  7    of Transhipment CMM IWG terms of reference, led by IWG Cho-Chairs (RMI and USA); (v) Draft CMM for Sharks, led by the Shark IWG Chair (Japan); (vi) Considering enhancements to the CMM on CMS in accordance with the future work in Section IX of CMM 2018-07, led by the TCC Vice Chair (Canada); (vii) SWG on the list of obligations to be assessed by the CMS in 2020, led by the WCPFC Vice-Chair (Niue); (viii) Harvest Strategy Workplan SWG, led by Australia; and (ix) SWG to develop a terms of reference for a workshop on high seas purse seine effort limits and bigeye longline limit allocation, led by Papua New Guinea.  AGENDA ITEM 2  — ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR"
WCPFC16,25,"The Executive Director introduced WCPFC16-2019-04: 2019 Annual Report of the Executive Director, which is a requirement under Rule 13 of the Commission’s Rules of Procedure. He indicated that if the Corporate Plan was approved, future annual reports would address the requirements of that plan. He stated that WCPFC15 key outcomes included approval for the continuation of the tropical tuna CMM, a TRP for South Pacific Albacore, and bycatch CMMs (for seabirds, turtles, etc). He observed that the lack of agreement regarding a science–management dialogue resulted in a 6-day meeting for WCPFC16. The Executive Director reviewed the work of SC15, which was undertaken under four thematic areas, and thanked the theme conveners for their efforts on behalf of the Commission. He reminded CCMs that the WCPO catch totals 81% of the Pacific Ocean catch, and 51% of the global catch. The services of the SPC-OFP supports the work of the SC, and he noted that the outcomes of their assessments would be addressed at WCPFC16. He reviewed the work of the NC during 2019, noting the joint activities undertaken with IATTC. He also reviewed the work by TCC15, which adopted a provisional CMR, while work on streamlining reporting requirements and development of audit points would continue into 2020. Terms of Reference (TORs) were adopted for the work of the transhipment review IWG, while the working groups addressing the flow of observer reports and electronic reporting and electronic monitoring were able to meet in the margins of TCC15. Institutional issues raised by the Executive Director included strategic planning; a summary of staffing matters; and financial and administrative arrangements, in particular, he highlighted the healthy financial status of the Commission as expressed in the unqualified auditor’s report. The Executive Director noted WCPFC’s trust funds and thanked the CCMs responsible for funding these (a list of voluntary contributions is provided in para 37 of his report). The Executive Director also noted the tremendous contributions made by SPC (scientific services provider), FFA (as Vessel Monitoring System [VMS] services provider), and ISC (scientific services provider to NC). The Executive Director also highlighted the relations of WCPFC with other organisations (including the UN and FAO, tuna and non-tuna RFMOs, and other Pacific regional organisations) and touched on the ABNJ Common Oceans and WPEA projects. Among key future activities, he highlighted the harvest strategy development work, and work on the new tropical tuna CMM."
WCPFC16,26,"FSM, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the Executive Director for the report, and noted that the Secretariat had tabled a draft Corporate Plan for consideration at WCPFC16, which they considered good progress, and looked forward to commenting on it later in the meeting. FFA members thanked the Commission for allocating an extra day at WCPFC16 to allow discussions on harvest strategies and noted with concern that Southwest Pacific striped marlin is likely overfished and that North Pacific striped marlin is overfished and subject to overfishing. FFA members encouraged all CCMs to take the required collective action to start rebuilding these stocks. FFA members also thanked the Secretariat staff that have moved on and welcomed new staff, noting that good staff are critical to supporting the work of the Commission."
WCPFC16,27,The Commission accepted the 2019 Annual Report of the Executive Director (WCPFC16-2019-04).  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  8    AGENDA ITEM 3 — MEMBERSHIP AND OTHER APPLICATIONS 3.1 Status of the Convention
WCPFC16,28,"New Zealand, as the Depositary of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, presented WCPFC16-2019-05: Status of the Convention. It advised that since its last report in December 2018, New Zealand had not received notification of any instruments of ratification or accession to the Convention."
WCPFC16,29,The Commission noted the report on the Status of the Convention (WCPFC16-2019-05).  3.2 Update on Observer Status
WCPFC16,30,"The Executive Director referred the meeting to WCPFC16-2019-06: List of Observers that provided the full list of observer delegations. The Executive Director noted that Curaçao sought CNM status for 2020, and observer status for WCPFC16, explaining Curaçao needed to be formerly invited as a non-party state observer to attend WCPFC16. The Executive Director also explained that Rule 36 of the Rules of Procedure (regarding Observers) was adopted in 2018, but that issues with implementation of paragraph 1(e) were raised at the Heads of Delegation meeting."
WCPFC16,31,The Commission accepted Curaçao as a Non-Party State Observer.
WCPFC16,32,The Commission agreed to exclude Inter-governmental Organisations from the application of Rule 36 (5) of the Commission Rules of Procedure and agreed to amend Rule 36(5) to omit the cross-reference to subparagraph 36 (1 e).
WCPFC16,33,"The Commission confirmed that the Secretariat should use 2017, 2018 and 2019 as the base years for the initial application for Rule 36 (5) of the Commission Rules of Procedure."
WCPFC16,34,The Commission noted the updated list of observers to the Commission (WCPFC16-2019-06).  3.3 Applications for Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) status
WCPFC16,35,"The Commission considered applications for CNM status for 2020 in accordance with CMM 2009-11, including recommendations from the TCC15. As outlined in WCPFC16-2019-07: Cooperating Non-Member Requests for 2020, eight applications for CNM status were received in 2019 from Curaçao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam."
WCPFC16,36,"Kiribati, on behalf of FFA members, stated that it is a privilege to fish and engage in related activities within the WCPO, and that renewal of CNM status was conditional upon full compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, and all WCPFC CMMs, and provisions of the WCPF Convention. FFA members stated that the Commission should consider the question of whether a failure to comply with established requirements should be rewarded with renewal of CNM status. They noted the difficulty in determining appropriate action when a CNM has been found non-compliant until “Actions in response to non-compliance” were progressed as part of the overall CMS. As identified by TCC15, issues of non-attendance (at least for the TCC and Commission meetings), late financial contributions, and compliance and data gaps were to be addressed at WCPFC16. FFA members sought guidance from the Secretariat on issues and information gaps identified at TCC15 and to be reported to the Commission before a decision to grant CNM status to an applicant is made. They noted that CNM applicants should at the least WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  9    participate in the meetings of the Commission and the TCC and must be available to respond to any questions relating to their application, stating that the Commission and TCC could not receive information from a person who does not represent the CNM applicant, and that the Commission must remind CNMs that there is an expectation that CNMs participate actively to respond to queries and rectify issues in a timely manner. FFA members thanked all CNMs for payment of financial contributions. On the issue of late payment of financial contributions, TCC15 recommended that the Commission apply the same expectations regarding payment deadlines and outstanding payments that are applied to full members of the Commission."
WCPFC16,37,"Solomon Islands, on behalf of FFA members, noted that certain CNM applicants were identified as non-compliant or priority non-compliant with respect to a number of CMMs during the CMS process in 2019. Where a compliance issue is priority non-compliant, CNMs are required to provide an explanation as to how these repeated instances of non-compliance will be addressed and not repeated each year so that this can be critically assessed by the Commission in determining whether or not to grant CNM status to each applicant. The issue of non-compliance must be addressed before a decision is taken. With regards to Curaçao, FFA members requested they provide information on their compliance record in other RFMOs."
WCPFC16,38,The Compliance Manager noted that para. 10 of WCPFC16-2019-07 contained the additional information received by the Secretariat.
WCPFC16,39,"The representative of Curaçao thanked the Commission for granting it non-party observer status for WCPFC16. Curaçao related that it is a member of ICCAT and has been a full member since 2014. Curaçao attended ICCAT’s last meeting, when only one item was notified (no information received regarding fishing in the EEZ of Curaçao). Curaçao indicated that no information had been received because no fishing licenses had been issued for Curaçao’s EEZ, and thus no data was provided. Curaçao stated it has been a member of SPRFMO for 2 years but was not fishing in that area. Regarding the Northeast Atlantic Fisheries Commission (of which Curaçao is a cooperating non-contracting party), Curaçao stated there were no compliance issues."
WCPFC16,40,"Tuvalu, on behalf of FFA members, noted that considerations in the grant of participatory rights to a CNM are captured in paragraph 12 of the CNM CMM. Rights may also be reviewed in accordance with the measure. They noted that where a CNM has failed to comply with any of the CMMs, it “shall be deemed to have undermined the effectiveness of the conservation and management measures adopted by the Commission” (para. 15 CMM 2009-11)."
WCPFC16,41,"FSM sought clarification regarding the interest of Curaçao in the WCPFC area, noting that while there appears to be a focus on providing supporting services to fishing vessels, Curaçao also has fishing vessels. Curaçao stated that they do have purse seine vessels and trawlers operating in other areas and have six carrier vessels and two supply vessels flagged. Curaçao stated it has no intention of becoming engaged in fishing activities in the WCPF Convention Area and is only interested in conducting transhipment in ports within the Convention Area. Curaçao would seek to comply with all CMMs and CMS (e.g., with VMS) to align with the WCPFC Convention."
WCPFC16,42,"The EU stated that they have formal dialogues on IUU fishing with some countries that are applying for CNM status and noted that some of these countries have been preidentified as non-cooperating with respect to fighting and preventing IUU fishing.  In this context, the EU also stated that despite the non-compliance issues identified in the Compliance Monitoring Report, it would agree to accord this year CNM status to all countries applying for it.  However, the EU will not support the renewal of CNM status to these countries next year, unless they will achieve clear and concrete progress in addressing the shortcomings in compliance with WCPFC rules and in fighting IUU fishing.   WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  10"
WCPFC16,43,"The Commission agreed to accept the applications for CNM status in 2020 submitted by Curaçao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand, and Vietnam."
WCPFC16,44,"The Chair noted that Ecuador was registered but not present at WCPFC16. Palau inquired why the Commission should entertain CNM applications if parties were not present. The Chair stated they would provide an update on Ecuador’s attendance at WCPFC16 and sought input from CCMs regarding the granting or renewal of CNM status to CNMs who were not present. The United States noted that CNM status had been granted by the Commission for 2020 through the preceding discussion, noting it was important to look at the rules for CNM applications. The United States suggested it might be possible to change the rules for consideration of future applications. RMI stated that it was hard to assess applications if representatives were not present, and that it was not inclined to support applications when representatives were absent. Japan agreed that more time should be taken to consider changing the CNM CMM. It agreed with the USA’s position, while observing that other RFMOs are not inclined to give CNM status if a representative is not present. Japan suggested one approach would be to give existing CNMs a warning but in the case of new applicant warnings would not be needed."
WCPFC16,45,"Nauru stated that, as the chair of the CNM SWG, and in light of the preceding discussion, the SWG would not consider El Salvador’s non-attendance, and would only take up the matter of participatory rights for the approved CNMs."
WCPFC16,46,"China requested that, to assist the SWG in its work, the Secretariat provide a reference paper regarding participatory rights that have been granted in the past."
WCPFC16,47,"The SWG considering the CNM participatory rights made the following recommendations and observations:  i. The SWG noted with appreciation the attendance and participation of Curaçao, Ecuador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand, and Vietnam.  ii. The SWG was made aware that El Salvador would be arriving the following day. The SWG delayed consideration of El Salvador’s participatory rights until they arrived.  iii. The SWG agreed to recommend that the participatory rights of Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand, and Vietnam remain the same in 2020 as they were in 2019.  iv. Curaçao clarified for the SWG that they would only be seeking participation for carrier and bunker vessels in the WCPO. The SWG agreed to recommend that the participatory rights of Curaçao would be limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels."
WCPFC16,48,"China inquired regarding supply vessels, noting that in other RFMOs this covered vessels deploying FADs to help purse seine vessels, and asked if that was the Curaçao’s intent. It asked for specific details regarding the vessels, and their number. The representative from Curaçao stated that it did not foresee deploying any supply vessels in the Convention area, and that it was comfortable with eliminating the reference if desired by the Commission. Curaçao stated that it has 6 carrier vessels."
WCPFC16,49,"The Chair inquired of Liberia if any FAD deployment was planned, and the representative of Liberia stated that it was engaged only in transhipment activities."
WCPFC16,50,"The Chair addressed the issue that had been raised by CCMs regarding non-attendance of CNMs at relevant meetings and the annual meeting. The Chair and Secretariat proposed changes to CMM 2009-11, in the form of a new para. 3(b) and an amendment to para 6."
WCPFC16,51,"The Commission agreed to amend paragraph 3 and paragraph 6 of CMM 2009-11 to include consideration of the attendance by an applicant for CNM status at the TCC and Commission meetings WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  11    where its application is considered, subject to the applicant being able to attend the meeting as an observer (Conservation and Management Measure 2019-01, Attachment F*)."
WCPFC16,52,"The Commission approved the applications for CNM status for 2020 from Curaçao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam."
WCPFC16,53,"Ecuador thanked the Commission for again approving Ecuador’s application as a CNM, a status it has been granted for more than 10 years. Ecuador stated that, along with other CNMs, it had been waiting for a long time for a legal, clear, fair and transparent procedure to become full WCPFC members. It recalled the discussion paper (WCPFC14-2017-DP18) presented by the United States to WCPFC14, which it stated could have represented a good starting point for dealing with the issue, but that the Commission expressed very little interest in changing the situation. The CNM application template was changed in 2015, asking applicant countries whether they had interest in becoming a full member. Ecuador stated it wondered why the change was made, if the information was not being used. Ecuador observed that it and most WCPFC members are members of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA), which are pillars of the legal international framework for oceans and fisheries, which stated that RFMOs shall not discriminate against any state or groups of states having a real interest in the fisheries concerned. Ecuador stated that attending annual Commission meetings year after year, asking WCPFC to address the issue, and not being listened to, undoubtedly constituted discrimination, and was a violation of UNCLOS and UNFSA. It noted this was quite different than what had happened following adoption of the new IATTC Convention (The Antigua Convention) in 2003, where several non-EPO coastal states (e.g., China, Belize and Kiribati) became IATTC members without any barriers. Ecuador again encouraged the Commission to set up a transparent framework and conditions to allow CNM countries to become full members, and specifically asked the Commission to accept Ecuador as a full member."
WCPFC16,54,"The EU supported Ecuador’s statement, noting that the Commission was failing to fully respect UNCLOS with respect to countries who have fishing interests in the Convention Area and wish to become a member, and stated that this could result in problems in the future that could lead to a trial in ITLOS."
WCPFC16,55,"Nauru, on behalf of the PNA stated that they did not support the expansion of the Commission to include new members. PNA members joined the Commission with the understanding that the WCPFC is a closed Commission, which they stated is reflected in the Convention, where the Commission has a different and less open process for considering new members compared to some other commissions. The WCPF Convention provides that new members can only join by invitation, and that invitation has to be decided by consensus. Nauru stated that the process reflected the nature of the Commission, where over 85% of the catch was made in the waters of developing countries, especially SIDS, which are highly dependent on those resources. PNA members believe it is misleading to invite applicants for CNM status to indicate whether they are interested in becoming a member of the Commission."
WCPFC16,56,"The United States stated that this was not a new issue, but one which had been previously debated at length. The United States confirmed it had tried previously to provide information to support a process by which new member applications may be considered. It stated it shared some of the concerns raised by the EU, stressing that Commission discussions should at least be consistent with the UNFSA, and looked forward to developing a way forward. The United States noted its concern was with the Commission’s lack of process which would at least enable respectful discussion of expressions of interest. The United States stressed it was not in a position to say that the Commission should be expanded, but that there should at least be a process in place to have that discussion."
WCPFC16,57,Palau stated that PNA members considered that the CNM process provided adequate opportunities for participation by countries that had not been engaged in the process of drawing up the Convention. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  12    3.3.1 Participatory rights of CNMs
WCPFC16,58,"The Commission agreed to the following limits to be applied to the participatory rights of CNMs (Convention / CMM 2009-11): a. In accordance with the WCPF Convention and WCPFC conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following participatory rights apply to Cooperating Non- Members (CNMs) for fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area;  b. In addition, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under their national jurisdiction or other CCMs’ national jurisdiction, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements;  c. CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPF Convention and the WCPFC conservation and management measures. In addition, CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV);  d. CCMs shall ensure that CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention; and  e. Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will take into account compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, and all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPFC Convention. CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the Secretariat for attention by TCC.  Participatory rights of each CNM in 2020"
WCPFC16,59,Curaçao: The participatory rights of Curaçao are limited to carrier vessels to engage in transhipment activities in the Convention area.
WCPFC16,60,"Ecuador: The participatory rights of Ecuador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2019-01 and CMM 2018-01 or its replacement measure."
WCPFC16,61,El Salvador: The participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. The total level of effort by purse seine vessels of El Salvador on the high seas shall not exceed 29 days in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2019-01 and CMM 2018-01 or its replacement measure
WCPFC16,62,Liberia: The participatory rights of Liberia are limited to carrier vessels to engage in transhipment activities in the Convention area.
WCPFC16,63,"Nicaragua: The participatory rights of Nicaragua are limited to purse seine fishing for one vessel, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area.

WCPFC16,67,"In accordance with the decision of WCPFC9 regarding the management of the overlap area of 4˚S and between 130˚W and 150˚W, vessels flagged to Ecuador, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Panama will be governed by the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area."
WCPFC16,68,"In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area."
WCPFC16,69,"For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with international and domestic laws, vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area.   AGENDA ITEM 4 — NEW PROPOSALS DP01"
WCPFC16,70,"FSM as the FFC Chair introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP01 FFA key priorities for WCPFC16. The FFC Chair called attention to CMM 2013-06 on SIDS assessment and the Harvest Strategy Work Plan and the need for more consideration of implications of harvest strategies and associated capacity building needs (addressed under agenda item 6.1). He also noted the skipjack TRP review, with a specific proposal for revising the wording of CMM 2015-06 on the skipjack TRP, which needs to be adjusted to reflect the revised skipjack stock assessment, observing that the updated analysis indicates that, with the new assessment model, a spawning biomass depletion ratio of 42% is projected to achieve roughly the same fishery outcomes as the 50% TRP was projected to achieve when it was adopted in 2015; therefore FFA proposes the TRP be adjusted from 50% to 42%; and that the text describe the TRP in terms of the conditions of the fishery in 2012 to avoid a similar problem in the future. Other items highlighted by the FFC Chair included yellowfin and bigeye tuna TRPs, timing of the management-science dialogue, the review of the Transhipment CMM, the work of the ERandEM Working Group, SW Pacific swordfish, renewal of CMM 2016-05 (Charter Notification Scheme), and fisheries subsidies.   WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  14    DP02"
WCPFC16,71,"Palau on behalf of FFA members introduced WCPFC-2019-DP02 Proposal for a CMM on Mobuild Rays caught in Association with fisheries in the WCPFC Convention Area. It stated that the proposal was presented to TCC15 and acknowledged the feedback received from many CCMs. As noted by SC12, mobulid rays are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of fishing, both as a target and bycatch species. There are insufficient data to properly monitor their status, meaning that a precautionary approach to management is required. For that reason, mobulid rays are already protected under the Convention on Migratory Species, CITES and by both the IATTC and the IOTC. The proposal would provide an equivalent level of protection in WCPFC fisheries. The proposal implements a prohibition on targeting and retaining mobulid rays, requires the prompt release of unintentionally caught rays, and the collection and submission of scientific data, obtained through interactions with these rays, to the Commission for an assessment of mobulid rays by 2023. It also incorporates best practice voluntary handling guidelines for the safe release of mantas and mobulid rays."
WCPFC16,72,"The EU stated it was fully supportive of the measure and reminded CCMs of its prior offer (at TCC15 and subsequently before the WCPFC16) to be a co-sponsor of the measure, which is repeatedly and inexplicably not endorsed by the proponents. The EU inquired whether extending the measure to recreational fisheries was appropriate. It was agreed that this proposal would be addressed under Agenda Item 8.4.  DP03"
WCPFC16,73,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP03 Proposal on CMM 2018-07, Section XI: Future Work, para 46(i): development of a process for assessing CCM actions in accordance with para 7(ii)(b) to replace para 27, which seeks to resolve the issue of conducting compliance assessments against CCMs based on individual vessel-level infringements identified in the WCPFC Secretariat’s online compliance case file system (CCFS). Australia stated that for several years the Commission had invested considerable effort to scrutinize CCM’s implementation, monitoring, and enforcement of certain obligations based on the activities of single vessels. The result is a compliance status for “Flag State Investigation” and a required accompanying report, “Investigation Status Report” that CCMs must submit yearly to update their internal actions with respect to specific cases involving each flagged vessel. This is counter to the purpose of the CMS (in paragraph 1 of the CMM): “...The purpose of the CMS is also to assess flag CCM action in relation to alleged violations by its vessels, not to assess compliance by individual vessels.” Australia stated that while the CCFS is an important tool for all CCMs to track and manage alleged infringements by their vessels and persons, their proposal would change the way in which information coming from the CCFS is used, by making the aggregated report provided by the WCPFC Executive Director pursuant to paragraph 26(ii) of the CMS measure the main report used by TCC in assessing implementation by CCMs of their obligations. That aggregated report provides a broad overview of systemic implementation issues across obligations, by flag CCMs, enabling identification of particular issues that require further attention, with a view to providing CCMs with needed support and assistance. Australia reiterated that resolving the issue at WCPFC16 was the highest CMS priority for FFA members and looked forward to working with other CCMs to reach a suitable outcome. The proposal was further discussed under Agenda Item 10.2. DP04"
WCPFC16,74,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members, introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP04 Climate Change. FFA members, proposed action on three fronts: WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  15    i. Increased focus and attention under SC’s Ecosystem and Bycatch Theme on the implications of climate change for the region’s tuna stocks; ii. Active consideration by the Commission of how, through appropriate CMMs, it can: a.  mitigate the impacts of climate change on Pacific Island countries arising from the influence of climate change on regional tuna stocks;  b.  reduce the carbon footprint of fishing in the Convention Area for fish stocks managed by the Commission; and  iii. Ongoing action by the WCPFC Secretariat and members, as well as other participants to Commission meetings, to reduce their collective carbon footprint, and the carbon footprint associated with WCPFC meetings.  FFA members stated that they looked forward to working with fellow CCMs to respond proactively to the threat of climate change."
WCPFC16,75,"The EU noted for the record that having the delegation proposals shortly before the meeting made it difficult for CCMs to take a position, referring in particular to the paper on climate change, given the need to have time to consult with stakeholders, and its member states."
WCPFC16,76,The proposal was further discussed under Agenda Item 13.2A. DP05
WCPFC16,77,"Samoa, on behalf of FFA members, introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP05 South Pacific Albacore Roadmap and Harvest Strategy. They stated that the much needed work to recover the fishery to the TRP as soon as economically possible should begin in earnest, and that zone-based management would be a key component in management of the stock and ensuring that FFA members’ sovereign rights were preserved within regionally-compatible limits. FFA members stated that they would reinvigorate the Albacore Roadmap Work Plan to clearly lay out realistic timelines for development of a revised South Pacific albacore CMM, including timely implementation and monitoring. FFA members nominated Fiji to take over the chairing of the Roadmap process and thanked New Zealand for their prior work in that role. The proposal was further discussed under Agenda Item 7.3.1. DP06"
WCPFC16,78,"Niue, on behalf of FFA members, introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP06 Views on high seas limits and allocation in the tropical tuna CMM, which presents FFA members’ views on high seas limits and allocation. Specifically, the paper provides the FFA position on the provisions of CMM 2018-01 that commit to agree on limits and an allocation framework for the purse seine fishery in the high seas and the longline bigeye fishery. The proposals were discussed under Agenda Items 7.2.2.1, 7.2.2.3 and 7.2.2. DP07"
WCPFC16,79,"New Zealand introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP07, Proposal on guidelines for the safe-handling and release of seabirds. New Zealand stated that it has the highest global diversity of albatross and petrel species in the world, with several species assessed as being at high or very high risk from commercial fisheries bycatch; accordingly, protection of seabirds is of great importance to New Zealand. Bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries is one of the greatest threats to seabirds, particularly albatrosses and petrels. New Zealand proposed adoption of non-binding guidelines for the handling and safe release of seabirds, which represent best practice advice developed by ACAP. The guidelines were endorsed by SC15, highlighted at TCC15, and supported by FFA members. The issue was further discussed under Agenda Item 8.3.    WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  16    DP08"
WCPFC16,80,"The EU introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP08 Proposal to amend CMM 2010-06 (WCPFC IUU List), stating that the proposal includes two key components: it introduces procedures for cross-listing and delisting of vessels engaged in IUU activities, and actions to be taken by CCMs against their nationals who are involved in IUU activities. It follows up on discussions at TCC15 (TCC15-2019-06a). The EU stated its belief that the proposed amendments would allow WCPFC to more effectively combat IUU fishing, and that cross-listing could effectively contribute to close the door in all regions to all vessels involved in IUU fishing, which would help to reduce incentives to become involved in IUU activities."
WCPFC16,81,"Australia on behalf of FFA members affirmed their commitment to combating IUU fishing, including through information sharing and cooperative responses to IUU. They acknowledged the risk posed by vessels that undermine international fisheries frameworks when they come into the Pacific region and that IUU fishing can only be effectively controlled by the cooperative actions of coastal states, port states, market states, states with nationals involved and regional bodies such as WCPFC. FFA members noted the proposal introduced two issues: the recognition of the IUU lists of other RFMOs, and a mechanism for the sharing of information on nationals engaged in IUU fishing. FFA members recognised and supported the principle the EU sought to achieve but raised concerns regarding the proposal’s administrative impact and implementation and noted their finding that the proposal would have significantly more impact on national administrations than suggested by the EU’s CMM 2013-06 assessment. They noted that the process is operational in other RFMOs and welcomed further explanations and guidance from the EU, and requested a proper analysis and assessment of the legal and institutional implications associated with recognition of IUU vessel lists of other RFMOs, especially non-tuna RFMOs, in order to enable a discussion of the potential risks for and liability of the Commission and CCMs. Regarding the control of nationals and reciprocal and cooperative arrangements for the exchange of information, FFA members requested that the EU provide a proper analysis/assessment of the legal and institutional implications, including but not limited to risks and liability associated with confidential information. FFA members stated that while control of nationals is important, as is information sharing, it must be subject to domestic laws and regulations."
WCPFC16,82,The proposal was further addressed under Agenda Item 11. DP09
WCPFC16,83," The EU introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP09, Joint T-RFMO FAD Work Group recommendations for consideration by WCPFC. The main recommendations focussed on effectively managing the use of FADs  and sharing information among RFMOs. The EU stated that given the importance of FAD fisheries in the WCPFC it suggested that the FAD management options WG consider the recommendations and continue engaging with the joint t-RFMO FAD working group. The issue was further discussed under Agenda Item 7.2.2.4. DP10"
WCPFC16,84,"The United States introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP10 Proposals on Tropical Tunas, containing three discrete proposals relating to the Commission’s CMMs for the tropical tuna stocks as follow:  i. A proposal to establish a plan of work for the Commission to move forward on its task, under paragraph 44 of CMM 2018-01, of agreeing on hard limits for bigeye tuna in the longline fishery. This was further considered under Agenda Item 7.2.2.3; ii. A proposal to establish a plan of work for the Commission to move forward on its task, under paragraph 28 of CMM 2018-01, of agreeing on purse seine fishing effort or catch limits in the high seas of the Convention Area. This was further considered under Agenda Item 7.2.2.1; and WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  17    iii. A proposal to (a) revise paragraph 18 of CMM 2018-01 with respect to the treatment of floating objects for the purpose of the FAD closures, (b) revise paragraph 4 of CMM 2009-02 with respect to the distance from FADs that must be maintained during FAD closures, and (c) request SPC to undertake work to inform consideration by the SC and the Commission of narrowing the definition of a FAD to objects with tracking buoys for the purpose of the FAD closures. This was further considered under Agenda Item 7.2.2.4.   DP11"
WCPFC16,85,"The United States introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP11 Rules of Procedure Relating to the Northern Committee. It noted that the NC has twice failed to obtain a quorum at its long-planned and properly noticed regular annual sessions. To enable those engaged in the NC to take timely decisions and to help ensure that the NC can fulfill its functions in a cost-effective manner, the United States proposed that the Commission reduce the proportion of NC members that must be present to open meetings and permit debate."
WCPFC16,86,"FSM on behalf of FFA members stated their view that the same threshold for quorum should apply to all meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies, and that to allow for a lower threshold for a quorum in NC was not agreeable. FFA members encouraged the members of the NC to consider how they could incentivise participation in NC meetings, noting that the meetings often take place outside the region and attendance can be a challenge for administrations that are already stretched with their regional meeting agenda and tackling domestic fisheries priorities. They suggested that one possibility was to hold NC meetings alongside one of the meetings of a subsidiary body of the Commission."
WCPFC16,87,The proposal was further discussed under Agenda Item 9.2.  DP12
WCPFC16,88,"The United States introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP12, Rebuilding Plan for North Pacific Striped Marlin, noting that because North Pacific striped marlin is generally not targeted, it was more appropriate to develop a rebuilding plan for the stock than a harvest strategy, and that the rebuilding plan could be incorporated as appropriate into harvest strategies for other fisheries. The United States stated that the primary objective in any rebuilding plan is to rebuild the stock to a specific level in a specific time, and for the purpose of designing CMMs to achieve that objective, the plan included a specific probability for achieving the objective. Given the WCPFC’s hierarchical approach for setting reference points, and because the stock recruitment relationship for North Pacific striped marlin is not well known, the rebuilding target was expressed in terms relative to the size of the estimated unfished spawning stock."
WCPFC16,89,"China inquired what the intention was for the format of the rebuilding plan — whether this would be part of the meeting record, or in the form of a CMM? The United States stated that the rebuilding plan would be a standalone document that would be posted under the Harvest Strategy section of the WCPFC website. The Commission would then have an obligation to reach the rebuilding targets; the specific requirements of how this would be done would be in the form of a CMM."
WCPFC16,90,"The EU stated that while the proposal was a step in the right direction, the very depleted state of the stock required urgent action. The EU stated it understood the difficulty in managing North Pacific striped marlin, which is caught as bycatch, but stressed the need to do more in the form of concrete actions based on a fully-fledged rebuilding plan. The EU noted the need to discuss potential actions that would contribute to the rebuilding when the issue would be discussed later in the agenda."
WCPFC16,91,"In response to an inquiry from PNG, the United States confirmed that the last benchmark assessment was in 2019, using figures up to 2017.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  18"
WCPFC16,92,The proposal was further discussed under Agenda Item 7.7.1. DP13
WCPFC16,93,"United States introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP13 Proposal for CMM for Charter Notification Scheme. It noted that the current WCPFC Charter Notification Scheme, CMM 2016-05, would expire on 31 December 2019 unless renewed by the Commission. SC15 (Summary Report, para. 71) and TCC15 (Workplan 2019–2021) identified potential issues with the management of chartered vessels under the current CMM. To allow time to identify and fully consider these issues, the United States stated it was proposing that the Commission roll the current measure over for a period of two years during which time the Commission and its subsidiary bodies should fully consider outstanding issues with the measure and explore potential improvements. The proposal was further discussed under Agenda Item 13.2.A DP14"
WCPFC16,94,"The United States introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP14 Draft guidelines for participation of observers in closed meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies which consider the compliance monitoring report. The United States stated that at WCPFC13, the Commission agreed to develop and adopt guidelines to enable the participation of NGO observers at closed meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies, in advance of TCC13 (WCPFC13 Summary Report, para. 658). The United States volunteered to develop a set of draft guidelines as well as a draft confidentiality agreement to be signed by observer representatives for their participation in closed sessions that consider the compliance monitoring report. CCMs provided comments on early versions of the draft guidelines and a final version was circulated for intersessional adoption in advance of TCC13. However, CCMs were unable to agree on the proposed guidelines. Some CCMs indicated that it would be more appropriate to wait for the final report from the Independent Panel to review the CMS prior to making a final decision on the adoption of guidelines. The final recommendations from the Independent Panel to review the CMS were circulated in March 2018 (WCPFC Circular 2018-15) and included a recommendation to adopt a phased process for observers to participate in all CMS discussions (Final Report from the Independent Panel to review the Compliance Monitoring Scheme, para. 34). In 2018, the Commission adopted CMM 2018-07, (CMM for the CMS), which commits the Commission to a multi-year work plan, including the development of guidelines for participation of observers in closed meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies that consider the CMR. The measure specifies that the work will take place during 2020–2021. During TCC15, in an effort to ensure that the work progresses during 2020, the United States offered to recirculate the previously drafted guidelines for the participation of observers in closed TCC and Commission sessions that consider the CMR. WCPFC16-2019-DP14 comprises the draft guidelines and draft confidentiality agreement as circulated in WCPFC Circular 2017-40. As agreed at TCC15, the United States stated it was offering the same draft guidelines for consideration by WCPFC16, where they could be considered under Agenda Item 10.2, review of the work plan of tasks to enhance the CMS."
WCPFC16,95,"Vanuatu, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the United States for their work on this issue, and recognised it as a constructive effort to address the concerns that CCMs, including FFA members, had raised with respect to the participation of observers in sessions dealing with the CMR. FFA members stated they would be ready to consider the issue once they had collectively agreed to a revised CMS measure that FFA members are comfortable was working as intended. They noted there was much work yet to be done, particularly on the issue of removing the “Flag State Investigation” elements of CMM 2018-07."
WCPFC16,96,The issue was further discussed under Agenda Item 10.2   WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  19    DP15
WCPFC16,97,"Korea introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP15 Proposed amendment to CMM for protection of cetaceans from purse seine fishing operations (CMM 2011-03), noting that according to a technical paper by FAO (Bycatch in longline fisheries for tuna and tuna-like species: A global review of status and mitigation measures, presented in draft form to SC10 as SC10-2014/EB-IP04), marine mammals such as cetaceans and seals are known to interact with longline gear, although information on marine mammal interaction with longline fisheries is limited. Korea stated that CMM 2011-03 addresses protection of cetaceans from purse seine fishing operations but no WCPFC CMMs pertain to the issue of operational interactions between marine mammals and longline fisheries. There is no specific advice from SC regarding the population of cetacean species or bycatch mitigation measure but Korea stated that this is a result of the lack of information and data on cetacean interactions with longline as well as purse seine fisheries, and that it was crucial for the Commission to collect as much information and data as possible while protecting all cetacean species to the extent practicable, as a precautionary and comprehensive ecosystem approach. Korea stated it believes that, once sufficient information and data are accumulated, SC may produce specific recommendations for cetaceans, preferably by species. In that context, the proposal seeks to expand the scope of application of CMM 2011-03 to longline fisheries. Because no fishery under the purview of WCPFC is known to target cetaceans, Korea stated that in its view the new obligation would not create practical difficulties for CCMs."
WCPFC16,98,"Fiji, on behalf of FFA members, stated it supported the intent of the proposal to improve the information available on potential interaction of cetaceans with longline fisheries, which in the long term could help the Commission to understand these interactions and enact effective measures to prevent incidental catches of these species, some of which are endangered. With this understanding FFA members stated they believed the information collected should be that which is of value to SPC’s work, and therefore referred the proposal to SC for their analyses on the type of information that should be collected."
WCPFC16,99,The proposal was further addressed under Agenda Item 8.4. DP16
WCPFC16,100,"Korea introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP16, Proposed changes to the Rules for the FAD Closure, noting that periodic FAD closures had been in place between 20°N and 20°S since 2009, following the adoption of CMM 2008-01. However, Korea raised the issue of compliance resulting from observer-reported alleged FAD sets during FAD closures (i.e. vessels setting on FADs when they assumed they were setting on a free school), which required effort and at times money to address. Korea stated that other tuna-RFMOs (e.g., IATTC and IOTC) had adopted much clearer FAD definitions, and Korea stated those organizations had been able to implement FAD-related measures more effectively and systematically, and avoided many unnecessary disputes that would have arisen in the absence of such definitions. Korea submitted a proposal to WCPFC15 to change the existing rules for FAD closures with a proposed FAD definition very similar to that in place in IATTC. However, the Commission adopted compromise text (paragraph 18 of CMM 2018-01) as a result of diverging views on the proposal. Nevertheless, Korea stated that in its view there was still room for improvement. Analysis by SPC (WCPFC-SC15-2019/MI-WP-11) suggested the potential impacts of paragraph 18 of CMM 2018-01 on the measure’s performance could be assumed to be negligible, although it was challenging for SPC to evaluate impacts precisely as key words (e.g., ‘garbage’ and ‘small’) in the paragraph were not defined. Korea raised this as one reason the Commission should revisit the issue and further refine the paragraph. Korea suggested a definition of FAD such as that used by IATTC would be much clearer and enforceable, but acknowledged this could be a drastic change for some CCMs, and stated that it shared their concerns to some extent. Consequently, Korea submitted the proposal in DP16 as an interim measure and looked forward to its adoption by the Commission; it stated its view that it was WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  20    highly inappropriate to regress to the previous definition of FAD or rules for FAD closure — i.e. the provisions in CMM 2017-01 — and that at a minimum the current text of paragraph 18 of CMM 2018-01 should be retained until the Commission agreed with and adopted an alternative definition of FAD."

WCPFC16,102,"Japan introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP17 Proposed research project to compare WCPFC aggregated historical VMS data with AIS data on the WCPFC high seas, stating that Japan’s Fisheries Research and Education Agency (FRA), the Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources and Security (ANCORS) at the University of Wollongong and Global Fishing Watch (GFW) had entered into a collaborative partnership agreement to investigate IUU fishing and strengthen transparency and governance of fisheries. Japan drew attention of CCMs to a research project proposed by FRA, GFW and ANCORS, which intends to compare AIS data and aggregated WCPFC high seas VMS data. The research project seeks to estimate AIS data coverage, identify data gaps between AIS data and WCPFC VMS data, and estimate total fishing effort in the WCPFC high seas area. Japan stated that the proposed project would increase the transparency of high seas fishing activities and enable the further development of methodologies for estimating and verifying fishing effort estimates, which would bring significant benefits to the understanding of high seas fishing operations and improve the accuracy of AIS data used for scientific studies."
WCPFC16,103,PNG and Indonesia thanked Japan for making the information available in the delegation paper.
WCPFC16,104,"The EU inquired why the project was limited to the high seas and noted that VMS data would be aggregated to flag. It stated that given the EU has just 2 vessels eligible for the project, aggregated data was not suitable in terms of the data rules. Japan stated that under the current data rules (2009) paragraph 13.5 stipulates that high seas VMS data will be made available, and thus the data rule allows use of VMS data for the high seas only."

WCPFC16,106,"Indonesia introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP20 Harvest Strategies for Tropical Tuna in Archipelagic Waters of Indonesia. It reminded that the WCPFC adopted CMM 2014-06 on establishing a harvest strategy for key fisheries and stocks in the WCPO, and agreed to a work plan for the adoption of harvest strategies in 2015. Indonesia stated that it intends to develop harvest strategies for its archipelagic waters that are compatible with measures mandated by WCPFC and IOTC. The paper provides an update on Indonesia’s progress to develop harvest strategies for its archipelagic waters. DP21"
WCPFC16,107,"Indonesia introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP21 Improvement on data collection for shark as bycatch in tuna fisheries, which details Indonesia’s challenges and capacity building needs. Indonesia related that provision of shark catch data (by species and gear) remains challenging for Indonesia to provide to the Commission. Indonesia submitted a capacity development plan to the Secretariat on 28 September 2017, with progress reported to the TCC15. Previous national annual catch estimate workshops focused on the catch by gear of the main tuna species, while shark catch data (by gear and species) were not discussed in detail. Discussion of the catch estimate on sharks (by species and gear) using available statistical fisheries data, port sampling data, log book and observer data have been proposed to be included in the next annual catch estimates workshop, which may require extending the workshop; it will also discuss issues related to WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  21    the provision of bycatch and discarded data. It is expected that the workshop will provide an estimation of shark catch (per species and gear) as well as catch of shark from logbooks and the observer program.  IWG Sharks"
WCPFC16,108,"The IWG Sharks Chair (Japan) introduced the work of the IWG Sharks, which began in 2018. During WCPFC15 many discussions were held on the comprehensive shark CMM. Disagreements were reduced until only one issue remained: addressing the issue of “fins naturally attached”. An 8th version of the draft CMM was submitted to TCC15, and the comments received were incorporated in a new 9th version of the draft CMM (WCPFC16-2019-IWGSharks-01) submitted for consideration by WCPFC16."

WCPFC16,114,"Indonesia introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP22 Information on Database of Indonesian Vessels Authorized to Fish for Tuna, noting that in accordance with CMM 2018-06 (Record of Fishing Vessels and Authorization to Fish), and Indonesia’s Presidential Regulation No. 61 of 2013, the WCPF Convention applies only to that portion of Indonesia’s EEZ within the Pacific Ocean (as defined by Article 3 of the Convention), and does not cover archipelagic waters, territorial waters, and internal waters. Therefore, Indonesia’s fishing vessels that are authorized to fish in archipelagic waters, territorial waters, and internal waters of Indonesia have no obligation to register in the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (ROFV). However, Indonesia faces a marketing issue, whereby a few importing countries were questioning the registration status of Indonesian fishing vessels that fish within Indonesian waters but are not under the jurisdiction of the Commission, and were not accepting Indonesian tuna products from these vessels. To address this issue Indonesia is developing a Database of Indonesia Vessels Authorized to Fish for Tuna (DIVA-TUNA), a database of authorized fishing vessels that catch tuna and neritic tuna within Indonesian waters, which includes archipelagic waters, territorial waters, EEZ waters, and fishing vessels authorized to fish in the convention area and registered in the RFV. The aim is to register, verify and monitor all WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  22    Indonesian fishing vessel that are authorized to fish for tuna, with the objective of applying and ensuring the traceability of tuna products throughout the tuna supply chain for better acceptance by international and high-value markets, to implement the management practices according to RFMO standards, to have transparency of tuna fishery management within Indonesian waters, and help combat IUU fishing activities. In establishing DIVA-TUNA Indonesia is seeking compatibility with CMM 2018-06, and DIVA-TUNA will serve as a complete repository of fishing vessels that are legal to operate within Indonesian waters.  DP23"
WCPFC16,115,"Indonesia introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP23 Information Paper on Labour Rights in the Fishing Industry (The Case of Unpaid Salary Disputes on Fishing Vessels), stating that on 13 November 2019 Indonesia was notified via email by the WCPFC Secretariat regarding an unpaid salary dispute at Apia Port in Samoa concerning several Indonesian crew members who tried to retrieve their salary from a fishing company based in one of the member countries of the WCPFC. Indonesia stated its belief that the company was breaking the law, and running a salary scam by not paying salary dues for at least 97 crewmen since January, 2019. In the hope of resolving the situation, the crewing agency sent correspondence via e-mail to UNESCO, UNDP, and UN-ILO offices in the area. In the same spirit Indonesia stated it was raising this concern to the Commission, and it considered the dispute an issue of labour abuse, particularly in terms where crews are forced to work intensely, over long periods of time, in difficult and dangerous conditions, with low or no pay. Indonesia stated that it hoped that the case could be resolved immediately to ensure the safety and the wellbeing of all the fishing crews, and that various actions, as detailed in WCPFC16-2019-DP23, could be taken to reduce the potential for such problems in the future."
WCPFC16,116,"Samoa thanked Indonesia for its statement explaining DP23 relating to an unpaid salary dispute involving a vessel and its crew that called in to Apia Port in Samoa. Samoa also thanked the Chair for considering Samoa’s paper notwithstanding Rule 20 of the Commission Procedures. Samoa stated that it was very concerned that such incidents and reports relating to the welfare of crews, and in this case, alleged labour abuse were being reported in relation to fishing vessels operating in the Pacific region. The matter was brought to the attention of the Samoan government through an email communication from an agent of the crew working on the vessels. The government looked into the matter when the fishing vessels in question visited Samoa’s port. Samoa noted that the vessels concerned are not licensed to fish in Samoa and primarily operate in the high seas. Samoa raised the matter with the relevant flag state for necessary attention and corrective actions through government-to-government processes, and also raised this matter with both the WCPFC and FFA Secretariats. Samoa reiterated the importance of the responsibilities of flag states as well as the collective effort of all CCMs as these relate to WCPFC Resolution 2018-01 to ensure the wellbeing of crews on fishing vessels operating in the WCPO. The FFA Minimum Terms and Conditions for Access by Fishing Vessels (MTCs) is also a fundamental mechanism to regulate access, and Samoa called for stronger actions by the WCPFC in this regard."
WCPFC16,117,"New Zealand on behalf of FFA members thanked Indonesia for submitting DP23 and supported the statement by Samoa. New Zealand stated that DP23 highlighted the serious labour issues occurring on vessels in the region, and the need for CCMs to take stronger action to address these issues; as well as to take steps to prevent further human rights abuses occurring on vessels in the Convention area. New Zealand encouraged other CCMs to follow Indonesia’s example and report similar incidents to the Commission, consistent with paragraph 5 of Resolution 2018-01 on Labour Standards for Crew on Fishing Vessels. FFA members noted that Resolution 2018-01 was an important step for the Commission and highlighted the decision by FFA Ministers in June 2019 to include labour standards in the region’s -harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions for access to commercial tuna vessels fishing in FFA members waters. They looked forward to working with CCMs to further strengthen WCPFC’s efforts to promote fair working conditions for crews on fishing vessels, including a safe and secure working environment with minimum risk to health WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  23    and wellbeing; fair terms of employment; decent working and living conditions on board vessels; decent and regular remuneration; and the opportunity to disembark, and seek repatriation if so entitled."
WCPFC16,118,"Cook Islands updated CCMs regarding its efforts regarding Resolution 2018-01, which they supported to ensure that working conditions on fishing vessels operating in its waters and of vessels flying its flag would be consistent with international best practice. Cook Islands acceded in November 2019 to the IMO’s 2012 Cape Town Agreement and encouraged other CCMs to do the same, and stated that Cook Islands’ Accession to the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006, which would take place in December 2019, would mean that Cook Islands would implement a suite of international legislation and take specific measures to ensure that the rights of all seafarers are protected within their waters, and further abroad for vessels flying its flag."
WCPFC16,119,"Indonesia thanked Samoa, New Zealand and Cook Islands for addressing the labour issue, which it stated it had sought to raise because similar problems had been ongoing for years. It noted that Resolution 2018-01 was not binding, and that Indonesia would seek to collect evidence and propose to discuss and adopt a CMM that is binding for all members. Indonesia noted that the incident described in DP23 involved WCPFC-registered vessels and was therefore appropriately addressed by WCPFC. DP24"
WCPFC16,120,"Indonesia introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP24 Vessel Monitoring System in Indonesia, detailing the situation in Indonesia with respect to VMS reporting. Indonesia confirmed at WCPFC14 that some vessels are still using Argos units, as well as another type of MTU that was not in the WCPFC approved list. Indonesia stated that it is not easy to replace VMS systems for a country the size of Indonesia, given the replacement costs; it is still being decided whether the replacement costs will be covered by the government or by the fishing industry and fishers. At WCPFC14 the Commission agreed that CCMs shall ensure vessels flying their flag do not purchase, install or transfer several VMS units and that they be removed from the WCPFC approved ALC/MTU list. The Commission further agreed that existing units on vessels shall be allowed to continue to operate for 5 years (until 1 January 2023). CCMs whose vessels use these models shall provide a list of vessels that are using the units to the Secretariat and shall update the list annually. Indonesia stated that additional details are provided in WCPFC16-2019-DP24."
WCPFC16,121,All proposals tabled for WCPFC16 consideration were introduced and proponents of proposals were encouraged to discuss them at the margins of the meeting and to report back on their progress to plenary.     AGENDA ITEM 5 — SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES  5.1 Implementation of Article 30 of WCPFC Convention and CMM 2013-07 (SIDS special requirements)
WCPFC16,122,"The Chair noted that para. 20 of CMM 2013-07 requires an annual review of implementation of this measure, and referenced WCPFC16-2019-IP01: Summary from Part 2 CMM 2013-07 paragraph 19 annual reports (WCPFC-TCC15-2019-11) and WCPFC16-2019-DP18: Report of the European Union on Article 30 of the Convention and Resolution 2008-01 of WCPFC (EU)."
WCPFC16,123,"Tuvalu, on behalf of FFA members, stated that implementation of Article 30 of the WCPF Convention is fundamental to the success of the Commission. FFA members recalled the decision taken at WCPFC15 to establish a separate page on the WCPFC website dedicated to information relating to the WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  24    Implementation of Article 30 and were pleased to see that the WCPFC Secretariat has completed that task. The webpage contains useful information that all CCMs and Observers can regularly consult. FFA members stated that the discussion under this agenda item was the foundation of all of work at WCPFC16, in ensuring that the principles in the Convention relating to the special needs and requirements of developing States are at the forefront of Commission decisions. Equally important is the need to ensure that the Commission’s processes are supporting both the capacity limitations and needs of SIDS CCMs. FFA members noted with appreciation the efforts by non-SIDS CCMs to report against CMM 2013-07 in their Annual Report Part 2. They stated that in the future it would be helpful for everyone if a standardized reporting format was adopted, and stated FFA members would seek to provide some guidance at WCPFC17. Given the busy agenda FFA members reminded CCMs to be mindful of small delegations and their fundamental right, not just to participate, but to participate effectively in the Commission’s work, which in some cases, relies on the support and cooperation of other CCMs."
WCPFC16,124,"The EU stated its main source of funding for development is the European Development Fund (EDF), which finances several programmes and projects in SIDS of the region and all western and central Pacific.  Currently, the most important fisheries related development action in the region funded by the EDF is the Pacific–European Union Marine Partnership Programme, also co-funded Sweden, and totalling about $50 million. The objective is to improve economic, social and environmental benefits through stronger regional economic integration and the sustainable management of natural resources and the environment. The program has several components—on oceanic fisheries, coastal fisheries, IUU fishing, and capacity development through capacity building on education, training and research. It is primarily implemented by SPC and FFA, with involvement by SPREP and USP. The program started in 2018, and some developments are directly related to WCPFC. In terms of IUU fishing, support was provided to enhance MCS efforts, both oceanic and coastal, and provide support for surveillance capabilities to support regular MCS exercises. Directly related to fisheries, the EU contribution also includes, among others, three initiatives on climate change, with the objective of adaptation and reliance building for SIDS and Territories, and a programme for sustainable use of marine resources. A contract will also be signed soon with the Secretariat for research on FAD acoustics that will be financed by funds from DG MARE (fisheries budget). The EU stated that the information should be reflected in the capacity needs table; it acknowledged this required additional work, but stated that was the objective of the Commission’s new website, and would increase transparency. Regarding the suggestion for a template to provide information on different actions to address Article 30, the EU suggested it would like to receive reports from countries regarding how they are using the support."
WCPFC16,125,"RMI noted and thanked the EU for their report and supported the statement by Tuvalu. On behalf of FFA members RMI reminded CCMs of the obligation in CMM 2013-06 to conduct a SIDS impact assessment in respect of new proposals and to consult with FFA SIDS members in the development of that assessment. They noted with appreciation Japan’s efforts over the last few years to consult directly with FFA members ahead of the Annual Meeting and encouraged other CCMs to do the same. RMI stated that the absence of CMM 2013-06 impact evaluations made it challenging for SIDS members to engage meaningfully in discussions on new proposals, which could delay or prevent their adoption, and stated that implementation of CMM 2013-06 was not a checklist, but a process. They stated that over time various approaches have been used to conduct the CMM 2013-06 impact assessments, which has made it difficult for SIDS members to review the true impacts of proposed new measures. If CCMs are still unsure as to how the CMM 2013-06 evaluations should be completed, FFA members referred to WCPFC15-2018-DP12_Rev1 available on the WCPFC web page under the Article 30 Implementation tab which provides guidance to CCMs on completing CMM 2013-06 evaluations. FFA members observed that CMM 2013-06 has been in place for six years and CCMs have had ample time to work with SIDS CCMs to understand the requirements of the CMM. They encouraged CCMs to engage early in consultations with SIDS CCMs as to any potential impacts of a proposal on SIDS so as to avoid situations where SIDS CCMs are forced to reject new proposals that lack adequate impact assessments. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  25"
WCPFC16,126,"Japan stated it fully recognized the importance of the CMM 2013-06 criteria, noting that FFA members, in DP01, stated that CMM 2013-06 can only be fully implemented through consultations with SIDS. It stressed the importance of multiple consultations through which an understanding between the parties could be developed. Japan thanked RMI for acknowledging Japan’s efforts in this regard. Japan stated it provided SIDS with ODA and capacity building through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Overseas Fishery Cooperation Foundation of Japan (OFCF). Between 2008–2017 Japan provided $1.1 billion in development assistance to the Pacific Islands, which included fishery-related projects, and cover conservation and management of highly migratory species and assistance to small-scale fishermen. In 2018 Japan’s Prime Minister pledged to implement development cooperation over 3 years, with a particular focus on human resource development, including people-to-people exchanges. Japan also noted that in 2008 it established the Japan Trust Fund in WCPFC, which has been building the capacity of SIDS for fishery statistics and management. In November 2017 OFCF signed an agreement with FFA to continue cooperation through the Japan Promotion Fund until 2027. Japan stated its hope that these programs and funds would contribute to the development of SIDS."
WCPFC16,127,"Korea stated that if SIDS CCMs were unhappy with how CMM 2013-06 is implemented this should be addressed. Korea observed that paragraph 3 of the CMM 2013-06 states that only the Commission shall assess the impact of a proposed CMM on SIDS, and suggested the need for a procedure for how an assessment is carried out (i.e., when and where an assessment takes place). Korea noted that it had shared its view with FFA members and would undertake further consultation with FFA and SIDS."
WCPFC16,128,"Indonesia observed that although it is not a member of FFA, Indonesia is also a developing country. It acknowledged the aid provided by the EU and Japan to assist SIDS. Indonesia stated that it hoped that CCMs would recognize that Indonesia also has some capacity building needs in complying with new CMMs."
WCPFC16,129,Cook Islands noted the comments from Korea regarding implementation of CMM 2013-06. It thanked the Secretariat for setting up the webpage and stated that it would prove very useful for evaluating CMM 2013-06 impacts.
WCPFC16,130,RMI stated that they appreciated the efforts by all countries to provide assistance to Pacific countries and stressed that CMM 2013-06 focusses on the need to take into account the needs and capacity of SIDS. RMI thanked the Chair for her efforts to address the issue.
WCPFC16,131,WCPFC16 reaffirmed the importance of assessing the impact of proposals on SIDS and encouraged CCMs to undertake such assessment when submitting proposals to the Commission.  5.2 Updated Strategic Investment Plan
WCPFC16,132,"The Executive Director referred to WCPFC16-2019-08, stating that one of the mechanisms adopted by the Commission to increase support for SIDS was adoption of a strategic investment plan. The plan seeks to match capacity building needs with appropriate capacity building strategies. The Executive Director referred CCMs to the Commission’s Article 30 webpage, which is a work in progress, and will continue to be updated."
WCPFC16,133,"The EU referred to Table 1 and asked if this could be enhanced to show what actions are under implementation. The EU acknowledged this would involve more work, and would require that each CCM that is providing funds also provides specific information on how that funding is being used are, but stated it is important to know what is being done by all members. The EU also inquired regarding the funding source for the capacity building identified in Attachment A (about $300,000 for meeting participation). The Finance and Administration Manager stated that funding comes from a number of different sources. About WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  26    50% is from CCMs (Canada, the United States, Australia, and Korea) via the Special Requirements Fund; other sources are the Working Capital Fund, the CNM Contribution Fund, and observer fees, as agreed to by WCPFC15."
WCPFC16,134,"Cook Islands, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the WCPFC Secretariat for their report on Strategic Investment Plan implementation in 2019. They thanked Australia, Canada, Korea, and the United States for their voluntary contributions to the Special Requirements Fund, which has provided critical support to SIDS CCMs in their ability to participate in important Commission work throughout the year. FFA members noted during the FAC discussions at WCPFC16 that the SRF balance is high and acknowledged this was unlikely to be the case in future years as meeting participation needs continue to grow and capacity assistance requests are increasingly matched to the SRF for support. Some SIDS members still had unmet needs for support to attendance at WCPFC16 and FFA members looked forward to working closely with the WCPFC Executive Director on how best to ensure that the Strategic Investment Plan is implemented as intended and appropriate assistance is provided through the Strategic Investment Plan, where needs are clearly identified. FFA members also thanked the governments of Japan and Chinese Taipei for establishment of their respective Trust Funds that provide important support to SIDS CCMs in their national efforts to more effectively manage their fisheries. They noted the requests from SIDS that have come through various sources and the potential avenues for assistance identified by the Secretariat. For future Strategic Investment Plan updates, they requested that further detail be provided on how and whether specific requests were met, including how the Secretariat assisted with any administrative support, where relevant. Overall, FFA SIDS members stated they were pleased with the adoption of the Strategic Investment Plan by WCPFC15 and they looked forward to its further development and to working with the WCPFC Secretariat and other CCMs on its continued successful implementation."
WCPFC16,135,"Australia supported the issues raised by Cook Islands, noting that the intent was to identify needs, and match those needs to potential funding sources. Australia looked forward to seeing improvements as outlined by the Cook Islands."
WCPFC16,136,The Commission approved the Updated 2019 Strategic Investment Plan (Attachment G*) and tasked the Secretariat to provide additional information and context to the revisions and updates made to the Strategic Investment Plan.   AGENDA ITEM 6 — HARVEST STRATEGY
WCPFC16,137,"The Chair introduced the agenda item by noting that the discussion would focus on progressing implementation of the Agreed Work Plan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 covering South Pacific albacore, skipjack, bigeye and yellowfin. She noted that the species-specific elements of the Work Plan would be considered under Agenda Item 7, and that updates on harvest strategies relating to northern stocks would be considered in conjunction with those stocks under Agenda Item 7. She observed that the Commission had made some progress in implementing the work plan, but that progress has been rather slow. At WCPFC15 the Commission agreed to an extra day for WCPFC16 to progress discussion and development of elements of the work plan. She observed some CCMs expressed concern that they did not all have the same level of understanding of some of the complex issues under discussion, and noted that, in recognition of the need for capacity building, SPC-OFP was making significant effort to build CCM capacity, including through some innovative approaches. The Chair also thanked NGOs for their involvement in that process.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  27    6.1 Overview of Harvest Strategy"
WCPFC16,138,"Dr Rob Scott (SPC-OFP) introduced WCPFC16-2019-09 An overview of progress in developing WCPFC Harvest Strategies, which outlines the elements of a harvest strategy and details the progress made to date in developing these elements for each of the four tuna stocks, as well as the outstanding issues that need to be addressed in order to meet the objectives of CMM 2014-06. In addition, a brief summary was provided of the measures taken to enable stakeholder consultation and capacity building on the subject of harvest strategies. The paper notes that work to date has focussed on developing single stock evaluation frameworks for skipjack and South Pacific albacore but that the development of frameworks for bigeye and yellowfin will require further consideration of mixed fisheries interactions. The paper concludes that, while substantial work has been completed and significant progress has been made, it will be necessary to revise and update some elements of the work plan."
WCPFC16,139,"PNG, on behalf of PNA members, thanked SPC for the important overview paper. PNA members stated that they have strongly supported work to develop harvest strategies for key tuna stocks, and continue to support that work because they believe that harvest strategies offer potential improvement in the management of WCPO tropical tuna stocks that are important to the PNA, and have already contributed to improving management of those stocks. In particular, PNA members see the potential benefits resulting from having pre-agreed rules for how fishing will be adjusted as the status of stocks changes, and from better taking into account uncertainty. However, for PNA members, this means that harvest strategies should not be seen as a way of reshaping arrangements and approaches that have already been agreed, except where this is necessary to ensure sustainability. PNG stated that if all CCMs try to use the harvest strategy to reshape existing arrangements to their own advantage, then the harvest strategy work will not progress, and the Commission will all lose the potential benefits from improved decision-making that harvest strategies offer. On this basis, PNA members looked forward to further progress on harvest strategies and would provide more specific comments on other elements of the Commission’s work on harvest strategies during WCPFC16. PNG also remarked on the need for further capacity building to enable meaningful stakeholder engagement."
WCPFC16,140,"Indonesia acknowledged the work of SPC, and the effort to share details on the harvest strategy work. They noted that TRPs can be based on various management objectives, (biological, social and economic), which may sometimes conflict. Given that, Indonesia inquired how the Commission would assess the future success of the management of its stocks, particularly if the objectives result in a relatively ambitious TRP, such as 0.56 for albacore. Indonesia also inquired regarding the setting of catch limits and catch allocations in the harvest strategy process, and how decisions were made regarding the number of scenarios that were considered. The presenter stated that the TRP is often selected because it reflects conditions that were favourable at some time in a fishery. Reaching the TRP would imply those other conditions are being achieved. However, he noted there may be additional objectives beyond those, and these can be in conflict. He noted this would be further discussed under Agenda Item 6.2. Regarding allocation, he noted SPC assumed some future distribution of fishing, but that its harvest strategy work did not reflect detailed negotiations regarding the allocation of catch into individual fisheries. Regarding the difference in the size of the grid of models, he agreed that 288 would be more than needed for skipjack, and that there was some redundancy. SPC seeks to capture major aspects of uncertainty over time using a factorial approach, with the result the grid can become very large. He noted some aspects of the skipjack model could be removed, while for albacore SPC had received requests for additional aspects to be examined."
WCPFC16,141,"Japan commented that in its view it would be best to use a multi-species approach. It was concerned regarding the presenter’s comment that some performance indicators (PIs) cannot be calculated, noting that one social PI important to Japan is “avoiding impacts on small scale fishers”. Japan stated that while it understood this is not easy to calculate, it is of critical importance for Japan as it would be very hard for WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  28    Japan to support the approach, without this PI. Although the paper states that a “skipjack management strategy evaluation has been developed”, Japan understood that MSE is a process, which should include a dialog. Stakeholders need the opportunity to give feedback, but that has not occurred, and Japan inquired what would happen in that regard. Japan noted the presenter’s suggestion that the harvest strategy process begin with skipjack in 2020. While understanding the difficulty in applying a multi-species approach, it inquired what the impact would be on outcomes for other species if this process began for skipjack, as there was the potential for unpredicted impacts on other species or ecosystems. Japan argued for the need to establish a multi-species approach over time. It agreed with PNG regarding the need for more stakeholder dialogue, and acknowledged that SPC was working on this, including discussing a possible workshop in Japan, and expressed its appreciation. It noted that the TRP combines biological and socioeconomic factors; for albacore the agreed value of 0.56 takes into account economic factors proposed by FFA members, and although high, Japan supported the level because it would mitigate the economic difficulties experienced by FFA members. Japan suggested that similar consideration should be given to the TRP for skipjack. Japan also asked whether allocation should be considered in the skipjack harvest strategy, noting that that of the IOTC does include allocation, and that some CCMs were opposed to this approach. Japan further inquired regarding how changes to SPC’s assumed historical distribution between different gear types (e.g., between longline and purse seine) would be handled, and whether this would force calculations to be done again. Japan closed by observing that CCMs probably have a general fear of what will happen if harvest strategy is pursued, and advocated for taking a slow approach, and ensuring all CCMs understand the process. The presenter stated that under the approach being used the harvest control rule (HCR) applies to the entire fishery, and scales up and down, assuming a constant distribution of fishing. If this changes slightly, it may have a minimal impact; however, significant changes in allocation could produce very different evaluation results. SPC’s expectation is that allocation changes would not change the HCR that was selected."
WCPFC16,142,"Australia stated it remained optimistic that the harvest strategy approach would be productive, and these would need to be considered. Australia noted the comments by Japan regarding allocation and stated its position that the harvest strategy process is separate and distinct from the allocation process and should be run separately and in parallel. It noted it would discuss the multi-species issues separately. On behalf of FFA members Australia stated they remain committed and optimistic that the harvest strategy approach is a sound pathway to achieving collective objectives with a clear and long-term perspective, and that they stand ready to play their part in progressing this work and finding solutions. Australia noted that there were clear implications for updating the harvest strategy workplan, and the schedule of work for the coming years, that would need to be considered at WCPFC16. Australia stated that FFA members are increasingly conscious of the complexity of the issues that the Commission seeks to tackle through the harvest strategy approach, noting the need to understand the full implications of decisions. Australia stated that FFA members would share additional points as WCPFC16 progressed."
WCPFC16,143,"The EU thanked SPC for their work, and agreed that the issue is complex, observing that not all members have same level of understanding. The EU highlighted that it is committed to the work and has supported it over time through voluntary contributions. It stated that given the complexity, doing harvest strategies for several species at the same time, including a multispecies approach, complicates the Commission’s work; other organisations have first focussed on a case study (single species fishery/stock approach), to allow everyone to understand the process before expanding to other species, while WCPFC is taking a different approach. The EU stated it did not see how this could be achieved while remaining fully engaged on all aspects. It noted that SPC had stated the process must be driven by members but suggested this was not currently the case because of the complexity and a lack of opportunities on the part of most CCMs to engage sufficiently with SPC on the process. The EU stated it would make suggestions during WCPFC16 on how to build capacity to enable CCMs to remain engaged."
WCPFC16,144,"Chinese Taipei noted that despite several years with significant discussion of harvest strategies, the process remained complex and complicated, and difficult for many CCMs to understand. Chinese Taipei WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  29    encouraged more engagement and education of stakeholders and stated that 4 years ago the Commission had chosen an interim Target Reference Point for skipjack which could serve as an example for other species."
WCPFC16,145,"In response to an inquiry from the Chair, SPC stated there was an opportunity to further investigate TRPs for skipjack, and that this could be discussed later in the meeting."
WCPFC16,146,"Kiribati, on behalf of PNA members commented in detail on progress on harvest strategies at SC15. They stated their view that while important progress has been made, the harvest strategy work was not going according to plan, and it was time to look carefully at the workplan. They noted that SPC’s comments and suggestions in WCPFC16-2019-09 were very helpful and agreed regrettably that it was unlikely that the 2021 timing for the adoption of HCRs for bigeye and yellowfin would be met for a range of reasons. They noted that a review of the workplan was needed in part because some harvest strategy decisions produced the expected results, with the failure of the interim skipjack TRP being just one example. The PNA considered the outcomes to date as good experience before CCMs had committed to any harvest strategy decision-making processes. However, the experiences increased the awareness of PNA members regarding the uncertainty and complexity in the harvest strategy process, and their caution about committing to additional decisions without a clearer understanding regarding the results. PNA members stated they were moving to a more holistic view of the process and outcomes of harvest strategies, rather than dealing with individual elements sequentially; thus PNA members understanding that nothing is agreed until the whole package is agreed."
WCPFC16,147,"The Chair noted that the workplan would be discussed under Agenda Item 6.7, following discussion of the species-specific aspects."
WCPFC16,148,"Tuvalu, on behalf of the PNA, agreed with observation in WCPFC16-2019-09 that developing harvest strategies that will address multi-species aspects is more complex than originally expected and that was a primary reason for the need to extend some timeframes in the workplan. They noted that two important principles would affect the outcomes of the multi-species work: first the need for the Commission to avoid transferring a disproportionate burden from the outcomes of harvest strategies onto SIDS — given the current structure of the purse seine and longline fisheries, it is impossible to have a harvest strategy for bigeye that constrains purse seine effort without transferring a disproportionate burden onto SIDS, and therefore that kind of outcome will not be possible; and second the need for trade-offs between the achievement of TRPs for different stocks — it will not usually be possible to achieve all the TRPs, and mixed fisheries harvest strategies will likely lead to one or two stocks being fished above or below the TRP. Ultimately, the models need to be able to evaluate mixed fishery harvest strategies of this kind."
WCPFC16,149,"Korea stated that it sought to implement a harvest strategy as soon as possible. It agreed with the concerns voiced by prior speakers, regarding complex, multi-species fisheries, and the resulting challenges that should be tackled by all members. It inquired when a harvest strategy for bigeye and yellowfin might actually be implemented, considering their complexity and the scheduled harvest strategy for skipjack in 2021 (with bigeye and yellowfin scheduled for 2022 in the workplan). The Chair state that this was impossible to predict at present."
WCPFC16,150,"China observed that WCPFC had not yet agreed to holding a science-management dialogue, with the result that harvest strategies were being discussed at WCPFC16. China stated it requires more time to understand the implications of the new approach. It agreed with the EU that any management measures should be driven by CCMs; noting Australia’s comment that harvest strategy should be pursued in parallel with allocation, China stated it could not devote sufficient time to do that. In general, it agreed with the PNA and Japan over the approach. At SC15, the conclusion was that more PIs are needed, but China stated it faces difficulty in providing the economic information needed for development of economic indicators. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  30    China stated it needed more time to consider the harvest strategy scenarios and the positions of various CMMS."
WCPFC16,151,"RMI stated that it had benefitted from capacity building in relation to harvest strategies, but that unfortunately there were new considerations that must be taken into account. It agreed regarding the complexity related to the consideration of new TRPs and a multi-species approach, including socioeconomic considerations, and noted that the workplan needed revision. RMI advocated for decisions to be made slowly, with allowance for differing capacity of CCMs accompanied by having the requisite resources to cater for those capacity building needs. RMI also noted the need to evaluate mixed fishery issues and looked forward to discussion of the workplan."
WCPFC16,152,"Japan recalled its previous advice to proceed with great caution. It noted that as long as harvest strategies remain a conceptual exercise CCMs would not be able to see what will happen, and suggested proceeding with a specific species; if the outcomes are unacceptable, the Commission could return to the starting point and try again through an iterative process. Japan suggested taking the approach that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and stressed the need to examine specific species, candidate management procedures, and actions."
WCPFC16,153,"FSM supported comments about capacity building and need for slow progress. It noted that SIDS economies are very dependent on fisheries and are just starting to see economic benefits. FSM stated that when HCRs are defined CCMs will be bound by these and stressed the need to ensure that the harvest strategy process will not have a negative impact on SIDS’ economies. FSM stressed the complexity of multi-species, multi-gear fisheries, and stated there is much to take into account before making firm decisions."
WCPFC16,154,The Chair stated that elements for individual species would be discussed under Agenda Item 7. Australia volunteered to revise the harvest strategy workplan as the discussion proceeded. 6.2 Harvest Strategy Display Software
WCPFC16,155,"Dr Finlay Scott (SPC-OFP) provided a presentation in reference to WCPFC16-2019-10 Using PIs to select a management procedure for skipjack and WCPFC16-2019-11 Using the PIMPLE software to explore skipjack PIs. He observed that developing a harvest strategy is a stakeholder-led process and stakeholder engagement is a key component of the approach. An important area of stakeholder engagement is the communication of results. When developing a harvest strategy, candidate management procedures (MPs) are evaluated using management strategy evaluation (MSE). Performance indicators are used by stakeholders to evaluate the expected relative performance and trade-offs between candidate MPs, allowing preferred MPs to be identified. Not all indicators will be of interest to all stakeholders and different stakeholders will likely focus on different sets of indicators depending on their priorities for the fishery. It is important that the results from the evaluations, including the indicators, are communicated to stakeholders in a way that allows them to select their preferred MPs. In evaluating WCPO tuna stocks, each PI will be calculated over three time periods (short-, medium- and long-term). Additionally, to reflect the uncertainty in the results each indicator reports a distribution of values rather than a single value (except for the probability-based indicators, such as the probability of SB/SBF=0 being above the LRP). Therefore, a lot of information can be presented through the PIs and other results from the MSE, making selecting a preferred MP difficult. For example, for the current preliminary results for the skipjack evaluations seven PIs are calculated and each indicator is calculated over the three time periods. This gives 21 indicators to consider for each candidate MP, nearly all of which are distributions rather than single values. As more MPs are evaluated and more indicators are included, the amount of information that needs to be communicated to stakeholders can become very large, potentially making it difficult to select a preferred MP. To assist in the communication of the evaluation results SPC is developing an interactive software tool: Performance Indicators and Management Procedures Explorer (PIMPLE). The aim is to facilitate the interactive WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  31    exploration of the evaluation results, thereby making it easier to compare and evaluate the relative performance of candidate MPs. By selecting and deselecting from the list of available PIs and candidate MPs it is possible to “drill down” into the results. This makes it easier for each stakeholder to focus on the key indicators of interest and consequently identify their preferred MP. As different stakeholders have different preferences for how the results are presented, the tool includes a range of different plot types including bar charts, box plots, time series plots and radar plots, as well as summary tables. The development version of the tool is available online. To help stakeholders use PIMPLE, two reference sheets have been produced. One summarises the currently available PIs used in the skipjack evaluations, the other has an overview of how to use PIMPLE, including the different plot types that are available. These reference sheets are available through PIMPLE."
WCPFC16,156," PNG acknowledged the work done by SPC to date and inquired whether this tool would be used in the in-country workshops, and if various harvest control rules (HCRs) (e.g., some with less drastic management responses than used in the examples previewed at WCPFC16) could be trialled. The presenter stated that PIMPLE was used in the last in-country workshop, and its use would continue. The HCRs were developed by SPC simply to explore the evaluation framework, and those currently in use were selected to offer contrasting results. He described the results displayed in PIMPLE as preliminary and stated that as work progresses SPC will seek for input from CCMs on trial HCRs."
WCPFC16,157,"Indonesia inquired regarding selection of HCRs and MPs when using PIMPLE, observing that there were no options provided to select different MPs. The presenter stated that at present all use the same data collection and estimation model, which, with the HCR, are the elements that make up the MP. Alternative MPs will be examined in the future. For South Pacific albacore (where the HCR is driven more by CPUE), enabling the use of differing analytical methods will be much more important."
WCPFC16,158,"Japan asked how the HCR would be affected when a new stock assessment model was employed. The presenter stated that SPC would recondition the current operating models using the current stock assessment. He noted that the HCR currently does not use either the 2016 or 2018 stock assessment model; it is similar to the 2016 model, but with different assumptions that make it more robust. He stated the same would be true for the management procedures."
WCPFC16,159,"The EU wondered if it would be possible to have incompatible PIs when defining the model, which could produce bizarre results, because the PIs affect each other, and asked what could be done in such a case, and if this had to be taken into account when defining the model, or would be addressed when looking at the results? The presenter stated that this was related to the nature of trade-offs with regard to various indicators, and that it was unlikely a HCRs could be defined that would perform well across all indicators, meaning the trade-offs would always be present; he stated this trade-off process may not have been discussed in detail by the Commission."
WCPFC16,160,"Kiribati inquired whether PIMPLE was being used with actual or theoretical data for skipjack or other stocks, stating it would prefer that actual data was used. The presenter stated that the results displayed to date related only to skipjack evaluations, but that the tool could also be used for South Pacific albacore. He noted that the historical results were all based on real data, but that 2015 was the last year with real data, but that this would be updated using the 2018 skipjack model."
WCPFC16,161,"China stated that the current international price of tuna was very low and asked whether a PI reflecting the principle that fisheries should avoid oversupply was included, noting that most CCMs would be interested in including such an indicator. The presenter stated this was part of a broader discussion regarding what PIs various CCMs would be interested in using. He stated that it could be tricky to narrow down the underlying assumptions and associated calculations, but that it could be possible for SPC to work with FFA to develop some relevant PIs. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  32"
WCPFC16,162,The Commission received a presentation from the Scientific Services Provider on the harvest strategy display software (PIMPLE) and encouraged CCMs to provide feedback to the Scientific Services Provider on the software.  6.3 Management Objectives
WCPFC16,163,"The Chair stated that the Commission needed to review management objectives annually and inquired whether CCMs were comfortable with the management objectives that have guided the Commission to date with respect to modelling, noting the management objectives from CMM 2018-01."
WCPFC16,164,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, stated that they had concerns regarding the value of including discussions of management objectives and their associated PIs on the agenda, given that the Commission already had recorded its management objectives. It recognised that PIs may need to be adjusted as the Commission moves through harvest strategies, particularly depending on adopted TRPs, and that FFA members would like to discuss how best to align these topics within the Commission’s harvest strategy development process, including if it is even necessary to discuss these issues in the future."
WCPFC16,165,"The United States observed that there is a disconnect between the recorded management objectives developed for the harvest strategy, which are a work in progress, and those already adopted objectives for the four main stocks, which are in effect through 2020 (the life of the tropical tuna CMM). The United States stated there are therefore two discussions: one regarding development of the objectives housed in the harvest strategies, and one regarding the objectives in the tropical tuna measure, which would be discussed in 2020, and become effective in 2021. The United States suggested that the current objectives in the tropical tuna measure could be somewhat outdated given that a good paper on minimum TRPs had recently been produced, which contained information that was critical to modification of the objectives for the next tropical tuna CMM."
WCPFC16,166,"The EU agreed with the USA, reflecting that discussion of the two sets of objectives did tend to become mixed. It suggested that the management objectives in place were precautionary given the uncertainty in the stock assessment for the tropical tunas, although somewhat arbitrary."
WCPFC16,167,"PNG, on behalf of the PNA, noted that it had been difficult to make progress on agreed management objectives and PIs, which was not surprising given CCMs’ diversity of interests. As a result, the list of PIs is longer than SPC would like for analysis, and different PIs are going to be important for different Commission members. PNG noted the importance of a PI related to disproportionate burden, which might not be important for single species harvest strategies but would be critical for the multi-species work. Without this indicator, a lot of work might be done on alternative management procedures that are simply not feasible for the Commission to adopt, because of the disproportionate burden implications."
WCPFC16,168,"Indonesia stated its understanding that the management objectives in the tropical tuna measure are very broad, and stated it was difficult to address all management objectives, including the PIs. Indonesia suggested the need to prioritize which management objectives must be achieved, and to base the TRP on traceable, quantifiable scientific findings, although other factors may also contribute."
WCPFC16,169,"The Chair stated that the Commission would bear in mind the comment by FFA members, and the observation by PNG (and the PNA) regarding the importance of considering disproportionate burdens, issues that also related to PIs.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  33"
WCPFC16,170,"The Commission reviewed the Management Objectives for tropical tunas contained in CMM 2018-01 and for South Pacific albacore and considered that there was no need to review the Management Objectives on an annual basis, but they should be amended as required.  6.4 Performance Indicators and Monitoring Strategy"
WCPFC16,171,"The Chair noted that CCMs had raised various issues regarding Performance Indicators (PIs) in discussions under other agenda items, and that the Scientific Committee had reviewed various PIs for both skipjack (SC14-MI-WP-03) and South Pacific albacore (SC15-MI-WP-03)."
WCPFC16,172,"Nauru, on behalf of FFA members, stated their concern that there were no direct indicators that measure the economic impact on SIDS. They expressed concerns about relegating such an important issue to the monitoring strategy. FFA members inquired whether the Scientific Services Provider felt this was adequate to minimise the risk of adverse economic effects to SIDs by a particular candidate management procedure. They also expressed concern about the issue of subsidies being taken into account in the PIs, observing that is not done at present; one indicator does address maximising economic yield from the fishery, but is not necessarily helpful because some CCMs may affect their economic yield in other ways (e.g., by employing subsidies)."
WCPFC16,173,"Japan referenced its prior statement on the issue and observed that the specific PIs of interest to CCM should be included, but observed it is essential to be able to calculate the PIs. Japan noted that SPC has made efforts to calculate a range of PIs, including the disproportionate burden on SIDS, and impacts on small-scale fisheries, and that this is particularly important for multispecies fisheries. Japan suggested that CCMs assist SPC to develop ways to calculate specific PIs, whether through provision of data or sharing of ideas."
WCPFC16,174,"Indonesia noted this is a very challenging process, and that data and papers considered by SC that inform how to achieve the management objectives and measure the PIs are based only on catch and effort data, and lack other data, including regarding economics. Indonesia stated that the Commission was better able to address biological and ecological aspects of fisheries than the socioeconomic aspects; it suggested that it may not be possible to assess all the PIs and management objectives and proposed the Commission should prioritize among the objectives. It suggested asking SPC which management objectives and PIs could be evaluated using available data."
WCPFC16,175,"RMI, on behalf of PNA members, stated they consider the discussion on PIs and management objectives for the tropical tuna measure and harvest strategies to be separate, and that the outstanding success of the existing tropical tuna measure shows why the major elements of this measure should not be changed."
WCPFC16,176,China agreed with the statements by FFA and PNA.
WCPFC16,177,"The United States commented that what is missing in the PI checklist is some reference to the economic viability of the fishery. This issue is not simply sustainable, healthy fish stocks, but also capacity and effort, as these impact the price of tuna and the economic viability of the fishery. In 2012 (a reference point for the viability of the fishery) skipjack sold for $2150/t; in 2019 the price was about $750/t. Central to the theme of PIs is economic modelling that includes many aspects that allow it to be profitable for vessels to catch fish. The United States observed the need to define the factors that help the fishery remain profitable and include these as PIs."
WCPFC16,178,"The Chair summarised that CCMs agreed there is a clear distinction between management objectives and PIs, and that there is no need to review management objectives. Questions were raised over WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  34    specific PIs and how these can be determined, and she noted Japan had proposed that members assist with provision of data."
WCPFC16,179,"SPC stated that with the MSE framework for skipjack, the assumption is that changes in the level of fishing are proportional across the fleet: allocation is not currently examined, so impacts on distant water fishing nation (DWFN) or Pacific Island fleets are proportional. Under multispecies approaches disproportionate burden could be calculated. SPC discussed the PIs in papers prepared for SC and welcomed further data and assistance from CCMs as works continues. SPC stated it had developed proxies for economic indicators, total catch, and catch rates, but lacked a detailed understanding of the economic costs within the fishery; such costs are currently calculated at the aggregate fleet level. Therefore, any economic data from CCMs would be welcomed. SPC stated it currently does not look at price elasticity but this could be done. Economic indicators should be included in the monitoring strategy, because many outcomes depend on how allocations are made. Monitoring changes in PIs is important, as it allows CCMs to compare the actual outcomes verses the model projections."
WCPFC16,180,The Chair noted that some of these issues would be further addressed under Agenda Item 6.5.
WCPFC16,181,"The Commission considered that it was important to consider economic indicators as performance indicators (PIs) and encouraged CCMs to assist the Scientific Services Provider by providing economic and other data to assist in development of PIs, including in relation to the disproportionate burden on SIDS, particularly with respect to multi-species fisheries.  6.5  Management Strategy Evaluation"
WCPFC16,182,"Dr Rob Scott (SPC-OFP) presented WCPFC16-2019-09 An overview of progress in developing WCPFC Harvest Strategies, which reviews the proposed approach for developing a mixed fishery and multi-species approach for the development of fishery-based harvest strategies. The approach has been devised to allow for the continued development of single species modelling frameworks for the four tuna stocks, which can be subsequently incorporated into a mixed fishery framework; this would investigate the implications of management procedures (MPs) for one stock on each of the other stocks. Under this approach, management procedures would be developed for skipjack, south Pacific albacore and bigeye tuna. Yellowfin tuna would not have a dedicated species-based MP. Rather, the impact on yellowfin tuna would be evaluated from the application of the combined MPs for skipjack, bigeye and South Pacific albacore to all fisheries that significantly impact yellowfin. This framework would be used to identify those MP combinations that have an acceptably high chance of achieving management objectives for all stocks, including yellowfin. While the proposed approach would not fully capture mixed fishery/mixed species interactions in an integrated framework (which would require multi-species MPs), it provides a staged approach for developing fishery-based harvest strategies from a collection of single species modelling frameworks."
WCPFC16,183,The Chair noted that the hierarchical approach introduced by SPC was endorsed by SC.
WCPFC16,184,"Japan referred to the prioritisation in the “Combined Modelling Framework”, which depicts the skipjack MP affecting bigeye and yellowfin management, and noted that prioritisation of species is important, and that SC had not agreed to prioritise skipjack over bigeye and yellowfin management procedures. The presenter agreed regarding Japan’s understanding of the SC outcomes."
WCPFC16,185,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, noted that the SC endorsed the development of a hierarchical approach to dealing with multispecies harvest strategy issues and thanked SPC for their development of an example of a hierarchical approach that might meet this need. While some FFA members are not ready to endorse an approach that includes no management procedure for yellowfin, and need to understand the WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  35    implications of these more clearly, they stated their recognition that this initial work was an exploratory analysis, and looked forward to further development."
WCPFC16,186,"Vanuatu stated that it required more time to fully understand the concept of management procedures and hoped capacity building options would be available to facilitate this. It stated its understanding regarding the need for harvest control rules, and indicated it had been supportive of that work, but needed to ensure a similar level of comfort with the evaluation of management procedures through the management strategy evaluation process."
WCPFC16,187,"PNG, on behalf of the PNA, thanked SPC for the large volume of work on the development of an MSE framework for skipjack, as reported in WCPFC16-2019-09. PNG stated that one of the elements that PNA members struggled with was the shift from the idea of testing alternative HCRs to testing alternative MPs. They stated their understanding was that the aim was not to adopt HCRs, as stated in the current workplan, but rather to adopt management procedures for each stock or fishery. PNG raised the following questions on this approach:  i. Should the workplan be revised to refer to adopting management procedures instead of adopting HCRs? If so, PNA members suggested this may involve substantially more work and take longer than is currently provided for in the workplan.  ii. As noted in WCPFC16-2019-09, various models may perform differently and CCMs will probably want to evaluate performance of models over time, which may take some time; would SPC agree with this assessment? iii. What information is available on the development of management procedures for other (non-WCPFC) tuna stocks, in terms of the volume of work and the process for completing it?"
WCPFC16,188,"The presenter stated that under the workplan the intent had always been to develop management procedures for stocks, which comprises data collection methods to establish status, and HCRs. He noted that the discussion had focussed on HCRs, but the intention had always been to develop the management procedures. The shift to a multi-species framework and the additional work it requires may require changes to the harvest strategy workplan, with a second method to determine the status of a stock. The primary requirement of the model is that it tracks the status of the stock through time and gives a good estimate of stock status. He agreed that there could be a need to evaluate the estimation model further. Regarding the experience with the development of management procedures in other RFMOs (in terms of the work volume and process), he noted that this was a lengthy process — for example, southern bluefin tuna took several years."
WCPFC16,189,"The EU thanked SPC, and supported continuation of the exploratory work.  It also expressed concerns about the lack of inclusiveness and opportunities of CCMs scientists to engage with SPC during the year (before SC) which is a fundamental requirement for such a process, especially noting that the work is expanding rapidly despite the concerns expressed by many CCMs for lack of time and opportunities to engage in this process."
WCPFC16,190,Japan noted that in ICCAT it was estimated that to develop a single species management procedure five 5-day meetings were needed.
WCPFC16,191,"Indonesia acknowledged the process to address mixed fisheries, and noted the major catch figures, but observed that no specific procedures for yellowfin were proposed. For “other fisheries” the yellowfin catch is quite large, and Indonesia observed it will be important to develop specific yellowfin procedures in archipelagic waters; it looked forward to further consultations with SPC to develop such procedures. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  36"
WCPFC16,192,"FSM, on behalf of the PNA supported the SC15 endorsement of a hierarchical approach to developing a multi-species modelling framework, and agreed with the initial focus on developing a single species harvest strategy for skipjack, which would subsequently be incorporated into a mixed fishery and multi-species framework. The PNA reiterated their expectation that the framework would provide for an analysis of trade-offs between the achievement of TRPs for different stocks. SC15 was presented with some interesting examples of how these trade-offs are analysed in harvest strategy models for other multi-species mixed fisheries. Such models allow for analysis of the outcomes of different arrangements for making trade-offs between the TRPs for different stocks. These include options for determining outcomes that maximize yields, or the value of yields, across the stocks as a whole. They stated their expectation that multi-species models would ultimately include consideration of schemes that would involve such a trade-off analysis."
WCPFC16,193,PNG stated that PNA members proposed that the workplan be considered an ‘Indicative’ Workplan so there is no sense of an obligation to meet the timelines.
WCPFC16,194,The Chair noted that the Commission requires time to provide guidelines in terms of the multispecies approach.
WCPFC16,195,The Commission agreed to task the Scientific Committee and the Scientific Services Provider with progressing work on a multispecies approach and to report back to the Commission.  6.6 Terms of Reference for a Management Dialogue
WCPFC16,196,"The Chair noted WCPFC16-2019-12, Reference Document on Terms of Reference for Science-Management Dialogue and encouraged CCMs to provide input on how to progress with harvest strategies in a way that would engage both scientists and managers."
WCPFC16,197,"Kiribati, on behalf of FFA members, reaffirmed their view that the dialogue be held immediately after SC. They noted that the intent of the dialogue as initially recommended by SC was to progress more expeditiously harvest strategy work, but stated that its increasingly complex nature meant more time was needed to ensure that all CCMs fully understand the concepts. FFA members requested more targeted capacity building at the national level on the concepts for their managers, noting that the existing national workshops by SPC, particularly on harvest strategies, were relevant for this. They stated that many FFA members did not see the value of holding the dialogue in 2020, although they would be interested if the dialogue could be initiated in the form of capacity building exercises for all CCMs."
WCPFC16,198,"The Chair stated that SPC had advised that they are working with CCMs through workshops and would visit CCMs to undertake capacity assistance in 2020–2021. She asked CCMs to provide input on how best to progress the harvest strategy (e.g., through an extended Commission meeting or via a workshop or other standalone meeting)."
WCPFC16,199,"Several members stated the extended Commission meeting was useful at WCPFC16 and gave tentative support for using the same approach in 2020 but noted the schedule would have to take into account the various working groups that were also planning to meet in 2020. Other mechanisms for enabling managers and scientists to interact, such as holding an extended pre-stock assessment workshop, or creating an electronic working group, were also suggested. The question was raised whether such a dialogue would make use of the TORs developed previously by the SWG, which had focussed on technical issues, and had envisioned a separate working group."
WCPFC16,200,"PNG, on behalf of PNA members, supported the prior comment by Kiribati regarding the need for significant capacity building prior to holding such a working group. PNG noted that the PNA agreed to the WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  37    Harvest Strategy Workplan on the basis that it would not require additional Commission bodies or meetings such as the science-management dialogue and would be integrated into the ongoing processes of the Commission. PNA members were reprioritising building their capacity to ensure they could participate effectively in the harvest strategy process and stated that they were not ready to engage in a separate science-management dialogue."
WCPFC16,201,"The EU stated the view that CCMs’ scientists should be able to interact intersessionally with SPC and failed to understand why this would be problematic for any CCMs. It referenced its proposal, as outlined elsewhere, including under Agenda Item 7.2.1.3.  PNG restated its view that capacity building would be needed to enable all CCMs to discuss these issues, because of its increasing complexity. Kiribati supported PNG’s statement, and stressed the need for national workshops before beginning processes such as the science-management dialogue."
WCPFC16,202,"In reference to suggestions from the EU regarding alternative mechanisms for CCM involvement, SPC noted that the SPC’s pre-assessment workshop is designed to receive feedback to inform SPC’s stock assessments and would not be suitable for discussing MSE work. It suggested there would technical issues to consider prior to conducting an electronic working group. The EU reiterated its interest in enabling CCM scientists to be involved in the MSE work, which suggested it was a matter of sovereignty. The EU stated its desire to be involved on a regular basis and observed that other CCMs had the opportunity to interact with SPC throughout the year. SPC stated that it could look at technical approaches to enabling increased participation, and that it intends to make the code used for MSE work available to CCMs. It confirmed that the MSE process should be transparent, while being mindful that these are very technical issues, and some members would have more capacity to contribute than others. SPC stated it would look into ways CCMs and SPC could work together more closely and suggested the SC meeting could provide such an opportunity."
WCPFC16,203,"Japan stated that it generally shared the concern expressed by the EU. It noted that with respect to typical stock assessments, some very technical discussions were held at the pre-assessment meeting, but with respect to MSEs — which are more complex — there is no opportunity for in-depth technical discussions with SPC experts. Results of the MSE work are reviewed at SC, but some CCMs feel the information presented is insufficient to evaluate what is being done. Japan observed that the more that CCMs feel uncomfortable, the slower the process will be; at a minimum CCMs should feel they have good access to information. Japan reiterated that there should be more inclusiveness in the MSE process than in the stock assessment process, and encouraged SPC to consider how to improve the situation. SPC observed there had been further requests for provision of additional information at SC and suggested it might be possible for SPC to work with colleagues at ISC to come up with a common approach to making these methods more transparent."
WCPFC16,204,"Canada supported the comments by Japan and the EU, and noted the TORs developed by the working group were not for a management meeting, but for a joint meeting where all stakeholders are involved. Canada encouraged consideration of moving forward on a process such as that discussed at WCPFC15, if significant progress was to be made."
WCPFC16,205,"The Ocean Foundation (TOF), on behalf of Pew, TOF, and WWF, stated that the Commission had committed itself to developing harvest strategies for key stocks or fisheries. Despite difficulty in reaching decisions on some elements of the harvest strategy approach that were scheduled for adoption in the workplan in 2019, there was significant detailed and productive discussion at WCPFC16, and TOF supported continuation of these discussions, stating that NGOs support capacity building in any form because harvest strategy work requires frank and open discussions among scientists and managers, and they need adequate time to focus on this work. They observed that for that reason both SC14 and SC15 recommended creating a scientist-manager dialogue working group. Other RFMOs, such as NAFO, CCSBT, ICCAT and IOTC, are using or have used scientist–manager dialogue groups and found them essential to WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  38    developing the harvest strategy process. TOF observed that CCMs agreed this work to be incredibly valuable to the future of the tuna fisheries in the WCPO, and stated that if such a body could not be created, the Commission should devote time and resources to continue to progress this work at WCPFC17, noting the discussions should continue, so as not to lose the momentum and consensus for the work that had been generated to date."
WCPFC16,206,"RMI fully agreed on the need to continue the discussion on building capacity regarding efforts to manage these stocks. It reminded the Commission that CCMs that are SIDS and coastal states need additional time, given the increasing number and complexity of issues being discussed. It supported the statements by PNG, Kiribati and others, noting the need for building capacity. RMI stated it was very important for processes such as the science–management dialogue to involve those who play a major part in the fishery and observed most of the fishery was in the waters of coastal states who depend very highly on these resources. It stated that all decisions made on the stocks affect each SIDS inhabitant, and thus SIDS need to be able to participate effectively."
WCPFC16,207,The Commission noted that the Scientific Services Provider is planning to continue to undertake workshops for individual CCMs to build capacity on harvest strategies.  6.7 Review of Work Plan
WCPFC16,208,The Chair referenced WCPFC16-2019-IP02 Agreed Workplan for the adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 and asked CCMs for their views on needed changes.
WCPFC16,209,"The United States stated that it was clear that the workplan would need adjustment, certainly in terms of the schedule, but that it did not see the need for large structural changes. It noted Australia had taken the lead in drafting some revisions. The United States observed that in terms of terminology “management procedure” is a new term, not used in CMM 2014-06, and that perhaps the next version of the workplan can explain what management procedure means if the term will continue to be used."
WCPFC16,210,"Japan noted its understanding that the Commission could proceed with skipjack management procedures, but establishment of a management procedure for skipjack did not mean it would be used, but rather that the Commission would then go on to address multi-species management procedures. This was confirmed by the Chair."
WCPFC16,211,"Tokelau, on behalf of FFA members, stated that while the work plan was a critical document for guiding the Commission’s development of harvest strategies, it clearly needed to be reframed, because development of harvest strategies for WCPO stocks is an ambitious task, particularly given the complexities of intersecting stocks and fisheries. FFA members considered it important that the workplan addresses those complexities in a way that provides clear guidance to the Commission, but the workplan must also be realistic. FFA members noted that Australia had offered to help update the workplan to reflect decisions at WCPFC16 and encouraged all members to provide inputs to that revision so it would remain a useful guide for the Commission."
WCPFC16,212,"PNG stated that it would be useful to frame the workplan as indicative, reflecting that some elements will change."
WCPFC16,213,"New Zealand stated that the goals for harvest strategy capacity building were described in WCPFC16-2019-IP14 National Harvest Strategy Capacity Building Workshops for WCPO tuna fisheries. It noted that the workshops described were funded by New Zealand, and that the intention was not to include these in the workplan.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  39"
WCPFC16,214,"FSM on behalf of the PNA stated that on page 7 of WCPFC16-2019-09, SPC indicated that WCPFC remained on course for implementation of a single species harvest strategy for skipjack in 2020. However, PNA members stated that in their view it was not realistic to plan for completion of a skipjack harvest strategy in 2020. If a skipjack TRP was agreed at WCPFC16, it would still require a revision of the skipjack operating model and agreement on several elements of a skipjack management procedure; that work could take several years, especially taking into account that less progress is likely in 2020 because of the effort needed to renegotiate the tropical tuna CMM, thus making even 2021 an optimistic timeframe for a skipjack harvest strategy. In the absence of agreement regarding a revised skipjack TRP at WCPFC16, it almost certainly take longer than 2021 to complete the skipjack harvest strategy."
WCPFC16,215,The EU reiterated that priority in the workplan should be on skipjack. It also reminded CCMs it had made suggestions to increase the participation of CCMs in the MSE work and encouraged CCMs to consider these.
WCPFC16,216,The Chair observed that adoption of the harvest strategy would entail a long-term commitment by the Commission and stated that CCMs should take as much time as needed to consider capacity building and the special needs of members.  The Chair confirmed that would be Australia work in the margins of WCPFC16 to update the Harvest Strategy Workplan.
WCPFC16,217,"After incorporating feedback and suggestions from CCMs, the Chair of the Harvest Strategy Workplan SWG (Australia) presented the Harvest Strategy Workplan. It was first developed in 2015, with an ambitious schedule, and was intended to be updated to reflect developments and progress. The workplan review planned for 2019 was intended to be thorough, and the SWG Chair stated CCMs had provided extensive comments, noting that CCMs were driving the process. The workplan is intended to be ambitious but realistic, and recognizes the need for time and capacity building, and learning from the collective experiences of CCMs. The SWG Chair thanked CCMs for their assistance with the update."
WCPFC16,218,"PNG, on behalf of PNA members, stated they supported the FFA statement regarding WCPFC16-2019-DP-01. They stated that the harvest strategy work had not gone according to plan in a number of important respects and required substantial amendments. Initial timeframes were clearly too short, and almost every element of the work is taking longer than in the initial plan, largely because the work is more complex than expected (and not because of a lack of effort by CCMs or SPC). In addition, the nature of some of the work has changed, the original goal was to adopt harvest control rules (HCRs)for each major stock, while now the goal is to adopt management procedures for each stock, which seems to involve reaching agreement on a monitoring strategy, the settings of the estimation model, and  HCRs. This could take several years even for skipjack, where progress has already been made. PNA members restated that 2020 was not a feasible completion date for that work. In addition, PNG observed that some elements simply did not work — for example, the skipjack TRP must be revised and reformulated. These developments have made PNA members much more cautious about agreeing to any further decisions on any elements of the harvest strategy work until the likely implications and outcomes are better understood. PNA members asserted that the harvest strategy must be approached as a package, rather than separate elements, and stressed the need to build CCMs’ capacity to engage in the work and understand its implications. They noted that future sustainable development of PNA members was very heavily dependent on the tuna resources being managed. While harvest strategies can enhance the long-term value of those resources, PNA members cannot afford to take the risks associated with work on harvest strategies without being fully informed about the implications of the decisions that have to be made."
WCPFC16,219,"China thanked the Chair of the SWG and supported the comments by PNG on behalf of PNA members. The EU thanked the SWG Chair for the updated indicative workplan, and suggested that in the future it might be possible to organise a SWG with interested CCMs to assist the SWG Chair with updates. The United States thanked the SWG Chair for their work, and made some specific drafting suggestions.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  40"
WCPFC16,220,"FSM, on behalf of PNA members proposed that the timeline for development of a skipjack management procedure be extended to 2022. They noted their prior hope that the timeline of 2021 for completion of a skipjack HCR could be maintained, but in supporting the FFA proposal for a revised skipjack TRP PNA members made it clear that failure to agree on a revised skipjack TRP would put that timeline at risk. However, they recognised that the questions raised about the FFA proposal were important and needed more consideration than possible at WCPFC16. In addition, as previously noted, the management procedure for skipjack has additional elements, as well as the harvest control rule. PNA members stated they found the advice of SPC and Japan provided at WCPFC16 on the experience in other RFMOs of development of management procedures daunting but very helpful. Consequently, PNA members regretfully concluded that it is likely to take longer than 2021 before the Commission can adopt a skipjack management procedure. PNA members stated they did not want to be bound by an unrealistic timeline for adoption of elements of the skipjack harvest strategy and could not agree to an unrealistic timeline of 2021, rather they could accept 2022, with the proviso that it may take longer."
WCPFC16,221,"The Commission adopted the Updated Indicative Workplan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 (Attachment H*).   AGENDA ITEM 7 — WCPO TUNA AND BILLFISH STOCKS  7.1 General overview of stock status (bigeye, skipjack, South Pacific albacore, yellowfin, Pacific bluefin, North Pacific albacore and North Pacific swordfish)"
WCPFC16,222,"Dr John Hampton (SPC-OFP) provided an overview of stock status, with reference to SC15 outcomes on status of stocks and WCPFC16-2019-IP03_rev1 Western and Central Pacific Tuna Fishery:2018 Overview and Status of Stocks. The total catch of main tuna species in 2018 was approximately 2.8 t, the second highest ever but within the range of catches over the past seven years. Purse seine catch in 2018 was approximately 1.9 t. Effort, as measured in vessel days, has been lower since 2015 compared to the record level in 2014. Total catch has also been slightly lower over the same period. Purse seine CPUE shows a long-term increasing trend, and was particularly high for most of 2019, which will likely result in a record catch when all data are available. As in recent years, the purse seine catch is approximately equally distributed between associated and unassociated sets. Longline effort has tended to decline since 2012, and catch has also trended slightly downwards since 2010, primarily through reduced bigeye catches. CPUE of yellowfin and bigeye in the tropical longline fishery and albacore CPUE in the southern longline fishery have been stable or slightly increasing over recent years. None of the key tuna stocks in the WCPFC Convention Area are currently estimated to be overfished or experiencing overfishing, in contrast to other ocean areas. However, the spawning biomass in relation to unfished levels of all stocks has declined substantially over several decades as the fisheries developed, before stabilising, or increasing slightly, in the most recent years. All stocks are above the LRP with high probability, while skipjack and South Pacific albacore are slightly less than their respective interim TRPs. However, several other stocks of billfish (e.g. north and southwest striped marlin) and sharks (e.g. oceanic whitetip and silky sharks), as well as Pacific bluefin tuna are estimated to be either overfished, experiencing overfishing, or both. The recent evolution of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was reviewed, indicating that the WCPFC Convention Area continues to be in an ENSO-neutral state, with most forecasting models predicting maintenance of neutral conditions through the first half of 2020. Long term impacts of climate change continue to suggest overall negative impacts on skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna in the WCPO, with projected eastwards displacement of these stocks towards the central and eastern Pacific, particularly in the second half of this century. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  41"
WCPFC16,223,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members, thanked SPC for another comprehensive overview of the status of the four main tuna stocks, which shows that the WCPO produces over half the global supply of the larger tunas, and all four of the stocks that straddle the equator are sustainable."
WCPFC16,224,"The EU noted that WCPFC has management based on a zoned approach and suggested it would be valuable to see graphics showing the catches inside and outside of the EEZs, as it would help understand the dynamics of the stocks and the fisheries. It also suggested it would be helpful to have additional graphs and tables on non-tuna species, including a figure showing the status of all species for all RFMOs. Regarding climate change, the EU inquired about the range and levels of uncertainties and how they are captured in the projections. SPC referred to Figure 17 of WCPFC16-2019-IP03_rev1, which displays (with orange shading showing 5% and 95% uncertainty) SPC’s best estimate of biomass, based on the use of a variety of models. SPC first estimates the impact of climate change on the oceans, and then projects the effect on tuna biomass. The uncertainty is quite high for some species, in particular albacore, which is driven by sensitivity to dissolved O2; climate models are not good at predicting dissolved O2."
WCPFC16,225,"Palau, on behalf of PNA members, stated that the continuing positive status of the major stocks was a good reflection of the quality of the management arrangements in place for tropical tunas. They noted that while this was encouraging, there is more to be done to address the gaps and weaknesses in those arrangements. They also noted that there are some other important stocks, particularly bluefin, where the Commission record is very poor; for PNA members a major priority continues to be the need to strengthen arrangements for FAD management, because uncontrolled growth in FAD use remains the biggest threat to the sustainability of the major tropical tuna stocks, and PNA members give high priority to measures to improve information on FADs and FAD tracking in PNA waters."
WCPFC16,226,"Japan stated that while the number of purse seine fishing days has decreased, catch has fluctuated, meaning that fishing vessels are likely becoming more efficient, and inquired (i) regarding the reasons for the increase, (ii) whether the number of sets was increasing, (iii) the effects of echosounder use, which is apparently increasing. SPC noted there was a very large increase in the number of free school sets starting in 2008, when WCPFC introduced a FAD closure. Vessels were then relearning how to set on free schools. A project at SPC funded by the EU is looking at detail at purse seine fishery evolution; SPC is seeing an increase in the number of sets per day, which increases CPUE based on number. FAD technological development is also a factor — vessels can select the most effective FADs, thereby increasing CPUE."
WCPFC16,227,"Kiribati, on behalf of the PNA, thanked SPC for the presentation and for the continuing high quality of the regional fishery overview paper on which the presentation was based. PNA members supported the EU’s request relating to the breakdown of catches by national waters and high seas, stating this was important because of the importance for CCMs of trends in relation to high seas fishing, and of the relative balance of fishing between high seas and national waters."
WCPFC16,228,"China noted all tuna species are in good health, which is not the case in other t-RFMOs. It agreed with the EU’s suggestion of the need for data to understand each CCM’s catch by year and species and inquired regarding linking stock projections with TRPs and harvest strategies."
WCPFC16,229,"SPC noted that detailed annual information on fishing distribution and catch statistics by CCM are published in the WCPFC Tuna Fishery Yearbook, and that these include aggregate distributions. Stock status in relation to LRPs and TRPs is provided in the detailed stock assessment documents."
WCPFC16,230,"The EU highlighted that the aggregated information should be broken down and catch and effort data displayed to CCMs, in order to enable a comprehensive understanding of the state of the fisheries and the impact of the Conservation and Management Measures in force.   WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  42"
WCPFC16,231,"RMI on behalf of PNA members thanked SPC for the chart on the status of stocks managed by different RFMOs, and noted the information relating to climate change. RMI asked SPC to confirm their understanding that yellowfin stocks managed by other t-RFMOs were overfished or subject to overfishing and all bigeye stocks were in the same state. SPC indicated that it directly reports what the scientific bodies of other t-RFMOs have reported. The reasons for the WCPO’s healthy stocks include the large component of the WCPFC fishery composed of skipjack, and the proportion of FAD verses free school catch (50/50); purse seine fisheries with a high FAD content will have a greater effect on yellowfin and bigeye. PNG inquired further on how estimates of stock status in other t-RFMOs was calculated. SPC stated that these reflect the standards used in those RFMOs. Not all use 20% SBF=0 (e.g., limits in the EPO are related to MSY, or a fraction thereof). Japan stated that other t-RFMOs sometimes use MSY as a borderline between these categories, and that it was not possible to simply compare stock status directly between t-RFMOs."
WCPFC16,232,"Indonesia noted (i) the higher uncertainty for South Pacific albacore compared to skipjack, and inquired whether this had been incorporated into the harvest strategy models; (ii) the low number of model scenarios for South Pacific albacore (24) verses skipjack (288); and (iii) the issue of dissolved O2, and increased uncertainty for South Pacific albacore, and inquired whether uncertainty related to environmental factors would be included in the operating model for the MSE work. SPC stated that albacore differs in that most (90%) is exploited as large adult fish by the longline fishery, with only a small troll fishery around New Zealand, which means that SPC’s data are less informative (there is a lot of tag data for tropical tunas, but not for albacore); this contributes to the uncertainty for albacore. SPC is considering how environmental impacts can be taken into account in the MSE, possibly using the Spatial Ecosystem and Populations Dynamics Model (SEAPODYM)."
WCPFC16,233,"New Caledonia noted that 2019 was the third year of decline in its albacore catch. It has only 20 longline vessels fishing in its EEZ, with historically very low fishing pressure, but overall catch trends are down (30% in 3 years), including a 15% reduction in albacore, and the industry is suffering economically, and New Caledonia requested insights from SPC. SPC indicated it would follow up directly with New Caledonia. PNG asked how to reconcile the decline in stocks in New Caledonia, as reflected by their comment, and the possible 50% increase in albacore is projected over the next 50 years, based on climate change projections."
WCPFC16,234,"RMI stated that that the indications of overfishing from other t-RFMOs provided an incentive for WCPFC to adopt the precautionary approach, while recognizing the need to be cautious in how overfishing is compared between regions.  Northern stocks"
WCPFC16,235,"Dr S. Nakatsuka (Chair of the ISC Pacific Bluefin Working Group) provided an introduction regarding the work of the ISC. He introduced general information regarding the stock status and catch of the northern stocks; North Pacific albacore catch was stable or declining in the last two decades, with the primary catch taken by Japan; Pacific bluefin tuna stocks have declined, and catch is low, with protective measures in place; and swordfish stocks are stable. He also referenced the stock assessments being conducted by ISC."
WCPFC16,236,"In response to a query from the EU regarding supplementary information, the ISC WG Chair and the Chair noted that WCPFC16-2019-22, -23 and -24 and WCPFC16-2019-IP10 and -IP11 had been prepared as reference documents for WCPFC16. The EU indicated that these documents were useful but some information was missing and that it would share with Secretariat what additional information it was seeking. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  43"
WCPFC16,237," The EU stated that the presenter mentioned that there are no reference points defined for the Commission that allow the ISC to derive stock status, and suggested where there is no defined reference point, that the default reference point defined by the Convention (MSY) should be used. In response ISC WG Chair stated that the evaluation was conducted against FMSY as one of 7 reference points, to provide as much information as possible."
WCPFC16,238,"The United States stated its understanding that there is no automatic MSY-based limit if the Commission has not adopted a limit reference point. It noted that it is very useful to have status against potential reference points examined, and voiced appreciation for how this was done by ISC. The United States stated that if MSY-based objectives are important for any CCMs, they should be among the potential candidates, as done by ISC."
WCPFC16,239,"Palau inquired how the bluefin stock could be rebuilding when there is still overfishing. Japan indicated that given a rebuilding target and projection, all that is possible is to take uncertainty into account, implement measures, and observe the results; with targets and measures it is necessary to see the interactions. SPC observed that some of the confusion on the part of CCMs regarding Pacific bluefin tuna is that there is a rebuilding strategy but overfishing is continuing, which raises the question of how these can be reconciled. The ISC WG Chair stated he is often asked this by fisheries managers: how can a stock rebuild when fishing mortality is over MSY? This can happen if stock levels are very low, but fishing mortality is lower than current biomass can support; as stock levels increase and catch level is maintained, the stock can rebuild, even given small increases in fishing mortality. Japan observed that despite the stock being shown to be overfished with overfishing occurring, stock size has been increasing since 2010, with the stock assessment indicating recovery will take place more rapidly than originally projected. Japan suggested ISC should consider altering the description so as to reduce confusion. The ISC WG Chair stated that the same could happen with any species covered by SPC stock assessments. He emphasised Kobe charts provide a snapshot but can be used with a threshold to indicate whether a stock is recovering; projections are useful as they provide an idea, albeit uncertain, of the future trend."
WCPFC16,240,"The EU noted that the discussion was very illustrative of how differently various CCMs understand key concepts regarding the status of the fisheries and the MSE framework. Regarding the United States’ intervention, the EU stated its understanding that the use of the reference point was not as a limit, but a benchmark for understanding stock status. The EU stated that for all tuna stocks MSY is used in Kobe plots as a benchmark and suggested that this should be done for bluefin as it is for other species.  7.2 Bigeye, Skipjack and Yellowfin 7.2.1 Harvest Strategy Issues 7.2.1.1 Review of target reference point for skipjack"
WCPFC16,241,"Dr Graham Pilling (SPC-OFP) presented WCPFC16-2019-14, Current and Projected Stock Status of WCPO Skipjack Tuna to Inform Consideration of an Updated Target Reference Point, which describes the 2019 assessment of WCPO skipjack tuna agreed at SC15. It incorporates new information on skipjack biology and improved model settings similar to how the assessment of WCPO bigeye tuna performed in 2017 changed the perception of stock status and productivity compared to previous assessments. The paper also presents results of analyses requested by SC15 based upon the 2019 assessment to assist WCPFC16 in its review of the performance of the interim skipjack tuna TRP. Those analyses indicate changes in effort and biomass from 2012 and ‘recent’ levels, and median equilibrium yield (as a proportion of MSY) associated with strategies that maintain a median of spawning biomass depletion (SB/SBF=0) of 40%, 45%, 50%, and 55%. These are compared to results under 2012 ‘baseline’ fishing levels.

No future ‘effort creep’ assumed, i.e. CPUE is assumed proportional to abundance."
WCPFC16,242,"Chinese Taipei addressed three issues: (i) the effect of effort creep, noting this was discussed in 2018, and stating that this has implications for understanding trends in fishing effort, with increases possibly related to technical improvements to existing vessels, or the addition of vessels. Chinese Taipei asked how much effect SPC considered this would have on the results. (ii) Regarding the baseline year (Fig 2. of the paper), the stock level in 2012 was much lower than in the 2014 stock assessment. The 2012 level in the new stock assessment is very close to lowest level of whole series. Chinese Taipei asked if it was still suitable to use 2012 as a baseline level for choosing a TRP? (iii) Chinese Taipei referenced (in Fig 2) the new stock assessment historical trend, which appears different from that presented by Dr John Hampton under Agenda item 7.1, and inquired why this was the case. The presenter replied (i) that effort creep is very hard to estimate. In WCPFC16-2019-14 SPC assumes it is not happening in the future, which is OK for a TRP. The question is then how management adjusts if effort creep is detected and conditions diverge from the TRP in the future. The approach is to manage around the TRP in the face of uncertainties such as effort creep. (ii) Regarding the baseline year: the lowest level identified in a particular year is 41%. The level in 2012 was 42%. The decision regarding suitability for defining a TRP depends on whether this gives what is desired in terms of the social and economic aspects. (iii) For Fig. 2, the historical trend is different between models, probably because of the settings in the 2019 stock assessment. The difference with what was shown under Agenda item 7.1 is that it represents instantaneous depletion in one year relative to an unfished condition in that year, while the TRP is in relation to the previous 10 years; the figures and projections are consistent with how SPC would calculate the TRP."
WCPFC16,243,"Japan suggested the need to separate issues to be decided by the Commission and those that should be the focus of conversations with SC or SPC. Japan agreed that the TRP needs to be decided by the Commission, but raised the question whether the explanation was scientifically justifiable. Japan recalled that it previously posed several questions about effort creep, and the answers from SPC suggested there could be some increase in the number of sets per day, and possibly increased CPUE as a result of echosounder use. SPC had indicated it was trying to assess this, and Japan stated it looked forward to receiving that information, but that it was difficult for the Commission to make an informed decision regarding a TRP if effort creep is hard to identify and estimate, and is to be left up to the Commission to react to over time. Japan stated that given that vessels are becoming more efficient, assuming unchanging effort over 30 years is not a precautionary approach. Japan agreed that the decision regarding the use of 2012 as a baseline is up to the Commission and stated that if the existing TRP of 50% depletion ratio should be automatically converted to 42%, that would be acceptable. SC had stated that because the median spawning biomass has been below the TRP, the Commission should take measures to ensure this fluctuates around 50%; that is now 42%, and thus not in agreement with the SC recommendation, and Japan stated it WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  45    should be addressed again by SC. In addition, Japan noted that additional discussion was needed regarding changing the model maturity schedule so it could be compared directly with 2012. SPC stated it does not have a good estimate of how effort creep is impacting effective effort in the purse seine fishery, which is proving very difficult to estimate, and making it very hard to project what will happen in the future. The effective effort on the stock will go up with effort creep, resulting not in a level of 42%, but an even lower number. This is not included because if a stock size equivalent to the 2012 stock levels is desired, and effort creep is present, it will be necessary to lower F to maintain the stock. SPC stated it would be happy to engage with Japan on the modelling issues, which are also discussed in an appendix to the paper."
WCPFC16,244,"Solomon Islands, on behalf of PNA members, stated that in DP01, FFA members proposed an approach to reformulating the TRP following SC’s advice: the TRP would be the spawning biomass depletion ratio consistent with the level of fishing effort for skipjack in 2012, and the condition of the skipjack stock in 2012. This percentage is estimated in the 2019 assessment at 42%. They acknowledged that this was a new approach that CCMs would need time to consider seriously because it was likely the Commission would need a similar approach for other TRPs."
WCPFC16,245," New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, noted that under the new skipjack stock assessment model, a spawning biomass depletion ratio of 42% is projected to achieve roughly the same outcomes as the 50% TRP was projected to achieve when it was adopted in 2015. FFA members stated they sought to avoid the need to revise the TRP in the future to reflect changes in the assessment model and model results not related to the state of the stock. SC pointed to the value of using a clearly stated reference period as the baseline for a skipjack TRP, comparable to the approach used for the South Pacific albacore TRP agreed in 2018. Therefore, FFA members suggested that the skipjack TRP be framed along the following lines as outlined in DP1 that: the target reference point for the WCPO skipjack tuna stock shall be the percentage of the estimated recent average spawning biomass in the absence of fishing (SBF=0, t1-t2), calculated as the median across the grid of models agreed by the Scientific Committee, that is consistent with the level of fishing effort for skipjack in 2012 and the condition of the skipjack stock in 2012. This percentage is estimated in the 2019 assessment as 42%."
WCPFC16,246,"The United States concurred that effort creep assumptions should not be included in the stock assessment; referencing changes in purse seine catchability, the United States inquired if there was a better year to use than 2012 as a reference year."
WCPFC16,247,"China raised the following issues (i) inquired if climate change impacts (on recruitment and distribution) were considered; (ii) stated if a TRP of 42% was used, this would mean increasing fishing effort by 16%, and inquired if this would negatively impact juveniles; and (iii) observed that skipjack prices were sharply down, possibly because of oversupply, and suggested that increased effort may not be wise. The presenter stated that (i) climate change has not been factored into the projections. Similar to effort creep, it is very hard to know the impacts of climate change, as the key impacts start around 2050, beyond the time range examined. (ii) Regarding increasing the level of fishing relative to the more recent period, a 12% increase would maintain stock at 42%, but the pattern of effort has fluctuated, making it hard to know if this will be constant. Juveniles are taken largely through FAD sets, and the impact of increased effort on juveniles would depend on the proportion of FAD sets. (iii) Regarding oversupply, he stated it was not known if this is due to oversupply in the global market."
WCPFC16,248,"The EU stated that this was a mechanical process, and that there was no need to alter the limits and management, as fishing conditions could be maintained with no impact on the stock. The EU stated that catch would have to be reduced to keep the TRP at 50%, which was not justified, because the stock is exploited sustainably. The EU supported New Zealand’s position, and suggested the TRP be adapted to fit the new data. It noted purse seine efficiency is improving, which is normal because of technological development. Limits are based on fishing days, and as a fishing day becomes more efficient, the limit will WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  46    become risky. The EU suggested there may be a need to change the methodology used to limit the fishery, which would impact allocation discussions."
WCPFC16,249,"Indonesia raised three issues namely (i) stated that the skipjack Majuro plot in the 2019 stock assessment uses different year ranges for spawning biomass (2015–2018) and the ratio of fishing mortality (2014–2017), and asked why; (ii) inquired why recent biomass and fishing levels are considered over a 4-year period, rather than a longer period (e.g. 5 years); and (iii) regarding Table 2 (change in purse seine effort from 2012 levels), Indonesia noted the wide range of fishing effort, and inquired whether this considered only fishing days, or other factors as well? The presenter stated that (i) SC used the last 4 years of the stock assessment for SB because the last year’s data was acceptable, but that was not the case for fishing mortality, so the earlier period was used; (ii) the 4-year period for the TRP was decided by SC, and avoids yearly fluctuations; and (iii) regarding effort, in 2019 SPC switched from fishing days to fishing sets, which produce roughly equivalent results in the current data. Indonesia further inquired whether the tables provide targeting for purse seine operating in the high seas only or include others areas (EEZs), and whether small purse seine fisheries were included? The presenter stated that SPC manipulated the effort in the key industrial purse seine fisheries in the stock assessment model; both EEZs and high seas areas are included, and the industrial purse seine fisheries operating in those areas."
WCPFC16,250," PNG stated that the interim TRP for skipjack was to progress the work on the harvest strategy, and is doing what was expected, and achieving the desired conditions. PNG suggested this view was likely supported by most delegations. PNG thanked the presenter and the team at SPC for their work, which was exactly what SC asked that they present."
WCPFC16,251,"The United States stated that the value of the fishery is one objective, and that there is a need to recognize the close connection between effort, catch and price. It noted that the price has recently crashed and is not sustainable. It looked forward to working with other CCMs to set an appropriate TRP."
WCPFC16,252,"Australia stated that it lacks an active skipjack fishery and thus was making its intervention from a scientific and technical perspective. As outlined by New Zealand on behalf of the FFA, Australia was lending further support to the FFA proposal to rescale the interim skipjack target reference point and tie it to a particular year rather than a fixed biomass, which would bring skipjack into line with the approach taken for the albacore TRP and that taken for the yellowfin and bigeye management objectives within the tropical tuna measure. Australia affirmed that each new stock assessment serves to update and improve the Commission’s understanding of stock status; this is the case with the latest skipjack assessment and was the case with other recent assessments (e.g., South Pacific albacore and bigeye). In each case the understanding of historical biomass levels has changed substantially with the most recent assessment. The FFA proposal reflects updated understanding of skipjack biomass levels and also seeks to “future-proof” the reference point against future stock assessments outcomes."
WCPFC16,253,"Nauru, on behalf of PNA members, thanked Japan for sharing their ideas on the revised skipjack TRP, and expressed disappointment that Japan couldn’t support the FFA approach, stating that while they could understand Japan’s position, it was not the way FFA saw harvest strategies working. The aim of a harvest strategy is to have in place a stable means to keep the stock near the TRP, with effort fluctuating around the level associated with the TRP. FFA members expressed the hope they could work with Japan to find a way forward. Japan stated that it had not addressed the TRP, but rather the SPC presentation. It noted that there had not been an agreement “that the new 42% is equivalent to the old 50%”, and suggested that given the series of questions posed, against some assumptions made, the matter should be discussed at SC."
WCPFC16,254,"Kiribati, on behalf of PNA members thanked China and Chinese Taipei for their questions regarding the FFA proposal for the revised TRP. They stated some questions could require further work by SPC and other CCMs and looked forward to making progress on those issues.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  47"
WCPFC16,255,"The EU inquired regarding the suggested tasking to SC, and what that would bring to the discussion. Japan stated its concerns regarding the assumptions, and whether this was a purely mechanical conversion. It reiterated its need to ensure the assumptions are valid."
WCPFC16,256,China noted that the impact on the juvenile catch from an increase in effort depends on the proportion that is associated with FADs. China stated it would assume that if total effort increases by 12% there will be an equivalent impact on the juvenile catch.
WCPFC16,257,"The Chair noted that a number of members expressed a preference for a TRP based on a median depletion level of 42% of SB F=0 in 2012. But some CCMs expressed concern whether this is indeed a simple mechanical exercise, and are concerned over the impact on juveniles."
WCPFC16,258,"The Commission requested the Scientific Committee to provide advice on:  a. the formulation of TRPs for skipjack tuna, noting:  i. the SC15 advice on a skipjack tuna TRP “that the Commission may identify a reference year, or set of years, which may be appropriate to use as a baseline for a skipjack TRP.”; and  ii. the approach to the formulation of a skipjack tuna TRP proposed in WCPFC162019-DP01; and    b. effort creep estimated in relation to the TRPs."
WCPFC16,259,"The Commission also requested the Scientific Service Provider to revise WCPFC16-2019-15 using candidate revised interim skipjack TRPs of 42%,44%, 46%, 48% and 50% of SB/SBF=0.  7.2.1.2 Target reference point for bigeye and yellowfin"
WCPFC16,260,"Dr Rob Scott (SPC-OFP) presented WCPFC16-2019-15, Minimum Target Reference Points for WCPO yellowfin and bigeye tuna consistent with alternative LRP risk levels, and multispecies implications (an update of SC15-MI-WP01). The paper re-presents median levels of spawning biomass depletion (SB/SBF=0) for bigeye and yellowfin tuna that are consistent with specified risk levels of breaching the LRP of 0.2SBF=0. The results are summarised in the tables below. Those tables present values of SB/SBF=0 that, if achieved on average, are predicted to result in the specified levels of risk of breaching the LRP, and thus may be interpreted as minimum levels of SB/SBF=0 consistent with specific risk levels. The outcomes associated with achieving the different risk levels, and the associated consequences for other stocks, were investigated and compared against the objectives of CMM 2018-01. The analyses were conducted across the uncertainty framework defined for the most recent assessments of yellowfin (2017), bigeye (2018) and skipjack tuna (2019).

WCPFC16,261,"Japan stated that the approach examines the level of risk of breaching the LRP, and then determines the TRP, but observed that the TRP includes non-biological factors. Japan expressed concern about the current stock level, although in the “green zone”, because fishing is not currently economically viable for some longline fishing vessels. Japan stated it had made some investigation about what level is more appropriate by looking at the historical level of the stock, and suggested one approach would be to use the 2000–2005 depletion level, when the Japanese fleet was able to operate successfully. This would result in a TRP of 0.41 SB/SBF=0 for BET. However, a problem remains in terms of which scenario will be used for recruitment, with many cases where the result of the stock assessment diverges because of differing recruitment. Japan inquired what SPC was suggesting in this regard. The presenter stated that the impact of different recruitment levels is given in Table 2 of the paper. The recommendation from SC is that more recent recruitment is the preferred option, but SPC also had requests from CCMs that other scenarios be considered."
WCPFC16,262,"Solomon Islands, on behalf of FFA, noted that as stated by FFA to WCPFC15, an important purpose for TRPs is to maintain stocks above levels where there is a very low risk of breaching the LRP, consistent with the guidelines in the UNFSA; and secondly, preferably achieve modest increases to SB/SBF=0 compared to recent levels in order to support ongoing economic management of the purse seine fishery and facilitate development opportunities for SIDS longline fisheries. Generally, FFA members are comfortable with the state of the skipjack and bigeye stocks but see some possible future issues with yellowfin, especially given significant impact on yellowfin juveniles by Indonesian small-scale fisheries, where there are some large uncertainties, and this may need extra consideration with respect to a yellowfin TRP. FFA members welcomed the views of other CCMs on this issue. However, due to the high importance of these fisheries to the economies of most FFA members, they stated more time would be needed to consider the economic implications of any TRP decisions, and stated that therefore TRPs could not be agreed during WCPFC16. FFA members expressed their strongly held view that current objectives for yellowfin and bigeye tuna in the Tropical Tuna CMM be maintained."
WCPFC16,263,"Korea stated that in setting TRPs for bigeye and yellowfin all these considerations are necessary, as mentioned in WP15, but it may not be possible to achieve them simultaneously for all species. Korea suggested giving priority to the species with the lowest estimated TRP."
WCPFC16,264,"FSM on behalf of PNA members thanked SPC for the analysis and supported the statement made by Solomon Islands on behalf of FFA. They noted that this was another critically important issue for the Commission and PNA. They noted with regret they could not support the adoption of bigeye and yellowfin TRPs at WCPFC16, as a result of (i) the need for economic analysis of the implications; (ii) uncertainty about the skipjack TRP and the need to formulate these TRPs using a specific reference period; and (iii) new assessments of bigeye and yellowfin will be prepared in 2020, with possible implications for the TRPs. WCPFC16-2019-15 will then need to be updated to take into account the results of these assessments and a revised skipjack TRP. FSM looked forward to progress on the work in 2020, to the extent allowed by the need to spend time on the tropical tuna CMM."
WCPFC16,265," Chinese Taipei suggested that, as TRP determination involves multi-fisheries, stocks and objectives trade-offs, the minimum values (SB/SBF=0 is to be maintained at or above the average SB/SBF=0 for 2012–2015), as specified in CMM 2018-01 paragraphs 12 (for bigeye) and 14 (for yellowfin), could be used as the interim minimum TRPs, which could be refined in the future."
WCPFC16,266,"The United States stated that the information in the paper was very informative for setting TRPs, but emphasised that TRPs should ideally include social and economic objectives. The United States referenced the TRPs proposed by Japan and FFA, and indicated the United States would be happy to consider those and others. The United States noted the Commission had tasked itself with revisiting the purse seine and longline limits, and that the paper was an essential information source for this. The United WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  50    States observed that FFA members had stated the current objectives for tropical tunas should be maintained, and stated it would agree to keep the objectives through 2020, but not necessarily after that, as they could be outdated by then. The United States asked FFA members to clarify what they would like to see happen with respect to the objectives in the tropical tuna measure."
WCPFC16,267,"The EU noted that the Commission had entered uncharted waters with the multispecies harvest strategy approach, noting it had already shared its views on the complexity of the one species approach. It observed that the risk-based approach is based on an extremely conservative LRP adopted by the Commission, and stated that it was clear that focussing on a TRP based only on the spawning stock biomass could lead to endless discussion every time a stock assessment is updated. The EU stressed the need to consider this for the future."
WCPFC16,268,"Tokelau, on behalf of PNA members, stated that discussions about how the TRP for one stock would affect the achievement of TRPs of other stocks was the wrong way to look at the issue. Given the current structure of the longline and purse seine fisheries, constraining purse seine effort and skipjack catches as a response to a harvest strategy for bigeye would involve the transfer of a very large burden of conservation action onto the SIDS in whose waters purse seining occurs. But practically that cannot occur because of the obligation on the Commission in Article 30 to avoid the transfer of a disproportionate burden onto SIDS. This obligation is repeated specifically in relation to harvest strategies in paragraph 12 of CMM 2014-06 on harvest strategies. PNA members stated that in practice this would mean that the achievement of the bigeye TRP would be related to the level of FAD effort and not the level of purse seine effort."
WCPFC16,269,"Indonesia inquired regarding the multispecies considerations for the TRP for bigeye and yellowfin, and whether these would also be considered for skipjack, and whether SPC had prepared a paper to more generally inform how the TRP is adopted for these species. The presenter stated that SPC had received no requests to extend this to approach to the skipjack TRP, and stated there was no plan to produce any further documents related to the skipjack TRP."
WCPFC16,270,"China observed that at WCPFC15, it agreed with the proposal for the South Pacific Albacore TRP, but received criticism internally because the proposal did not go through the SC."
WCPFC16,271,"Palau stated that its position was to maintain the current management objectives for the two stocks, and then revisit the issue at WCPFC17."
WCPFC16,272,"The Ocean Foundation (TOF), on behalf of TOF, Pew, and WWF, reiterated the importance of the harvest strategy process, which responds directly to the objectives in the WCPF Convention that all members share with respect to achieving sustainable fisheries. They stated that it was encouraging that CCMs generally agreed on the importance of the harvest strategy process in the WCPO, and that for bigeye and yellowfin, CCMs had the opportunity to make progress by adopting TRPs for those stocks. They stated their understanding that these decisions required careful consideration, but that the Commission could agree on interim points that could be used for future analysis. They also noted that despite significant previous investment in education and capacity building around harvest strategies development, over the course of several years, the discussion at WCPFC16 underscored the need to create a body such as the scientist–manager dialogue working group. This would help progress the process of developing harvest strategies and improve understanding by answering some questions via dialogue among managers, scientists and other stakeholders. It would also be another opportunity for members to take greater control of the process. If needed, the dialogue group could be configured to focus its first meeting or meetings on capacity building or informal discussions, to enable a greater understanding and comfort with the harvest strategy approach. They also emphasised that the Commission had a responsibility to ensure stocks are sustainably managed for the long term, and that each year of inaction risks their long-term sustainability. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  51"
WCPFC16,273,"The Commission requested the Scientific Committee to provide advice on the formulation of TRPs for bigeye and yellowfin tuna for other candidate TRP indicators other than depletion ratio, such as longline CPUE."
WCPFC16,274,"The Commission further requested the Scientific Service Provider to conduct an analysis for bigeye and yellowfin tuna similar to that undertaken in WCPFC16-2019-14 for skipjack. It further tasked SC16 in 2020 to review the bigeye and yellowfin assessments, advise on the uncertainty grid and provide advice on the range of depletion for analysis. With regard to the range of depletion, the Commission tasked the Scientific Service Provider to conduct the analysis and present their outcomes in 2020 to the TCC16 and WCPFC17."
WCPFC16,275,The Commission considered the development of target reference points for bigeye and yellowfin and agreed that in the interim paragraphs 12 and 14 of CMM 2018-01 be retained. It further tasked the Scientific Committee and the Scientific Service Provider to continue to explore potential candidate target reference points for the two stocks.   7.2.1.3 Harvest control rules and management strategy evaluation for skipjack
WCPFC16,276,"Dr Rob Scott (SPC-OFP) with reference to WCPFC16-2019-16 Results of Initial Evaluations of Management Procedures for Skipjack, provided a brief presentation on the current status of the Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) framework for skipjack tuna and the design of the harvest control rules (HCRs) that are currently under investigation. It was noted that model-based management procedures (MPs) were currently being investigated but that the option to investigate empirical MPs had not been ruled out. The HCRs currently under investigation for skipjack are based on the level and distribution of fishing in 2012 and apply to all fisheries with the exception of the archipelagic waters of the Solomon Islands and PNG, for which status quo (2012) conditions are assumed. Members were invited to propose alternative HCRs that could also be evaluated within the framework."
WCPFC16,277,"Tuvalu, on behalf of FFA members emphasised the importance of including a PI for skipjack addressing disproportionate burden, and noted this was equally if not more important in multi-species analyses. It inquired whether SPC could reinstate this indicator for future analyses?"
WCPFC16,278,"Japan suggested that in practice employing an HCR would entail some level of fluctuations (e.g., 10%) around a TRP; at present the limit for such fluctuations is set at a stock status of 0.4 SB/SBF=0, beyond which the Commission must take measures to regulate the stock. Japan made following points (i) inquired how that breaking point was decided, whether one criterion was the expected natural variation in the stock over the time, and whether other factors were involved; (ii) remarked on the importance of calculating various PIs (including the indicator on disproportionate burden mentioned by FFA members), and inquired if SPC could make another effort to calculate the PIs considered important by CCMs; (iii) noted, regarding a mixed fishery and MSE approach, that while SPC could conduct a MSE focussing only on skipjack, before applying management procedures it was important to examine the effect of skipjack management procedures on other species, to ensure they did not have a negative effect, and to at least be aware of and consider trade-offs; (iv) stated that if skipjack was the priority species, then procedures could maximize benefits with regard to skipjack, but that the Commission needed to be aware and clearly understand the trade-offs that could result; and (v) reiterated that it supported the process but wanted to look at all species before applying this approach to skipjack."
WCPFC16,279,"In response, the presenter stated that the value of 0.4 was fairly arbitrary, and a different assumption could be used. He noted that variability does enter through recruitment, and that under the HCR being discussed, effort was maintained at the 2012 level even if the stock was below the TRP. He noted that WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  52    achievement of the TRP was just one PI — others are stability in catch, yield and effort. This TRP would be better at maintaining stability in effort, and possibly in catches, with a small leeway around the target; it would then be compared with other TRPs. Regarding calculation of PIs, problems arise because of the degree to which fisheries are aggregated in the evaluation framework. The work presented is based on the current stock assessment, and the level of aggregation in the stock assessment thus determines what SPC can do with the TRP. Proxies are used, and the level of depletion of the stock may be a good proxy —if the stock level is maintained, it may indicate that small-scale fishers are not overly impacted. Regarding the mixed fishery component and the impact on other species, SPC has not looked at this to date, but will do so."
WCPFC16,280,"PNG supported the comments made by Japan regarding PIMPLE. It suggested the HCR design was possibly overly stark or drastic in terms of changes that are made once a point of inflection is reached and suggested more staggered points of inflection (and thus more gradual changes to the fishery) would be better. PNG agreed regarding the need to look at trade-offs in the future, and inquired what ratios would be used (50%, or 42%, which is FFA’s preference). PNG noted that PNA members wanted to ensure that a failure to agree on a revised TRP did not bring the work on a skipjack management procedure to a halt. For PNA members, proceeding with MSE work on the basis of the previous interim TRP (based on a different characterisation of the skipjack stock than the model that will be used for the MSE) did not make sense, and suggested this would probably require identifying more than one candidate revised TRP to be used in further analyses. PNA members proposed that the MSE work should continue using a 42% depletion ratio, at least as one of the options for the TRP."
WCPFC16,281,"The EU stated it understood this was a work in progress, and that it was a priority. Given the Commission’s limited resources, the EU suggested progressing this as a case study, and using the experience to better consider other species in the future, while improving the current process, especially by increasing the participation by CCMs. The EU proposed developing a process through which CCMs could be more involved in key issues (e.g., conditioning of the model, determination of key assumptions, and the design of the HCR). It suggested doing this either by extending the SPC’s pre-assessment workshop to allow for more time and discussion on the MSC work, or by creating an electronic working group coordinated by SPC or a member, which would allow participation by CCM scientists in the MSC work. The EU stated it would be happy to consider other options but that a way to involve all members was needed."
WCPFC16,282,"Indonesia stated that the paper (Section 3.1) made the assumption that all fisheries are subject to HCRs, except fisheries in archipelagic waters in region 5, and stated their understanding that this included Indonesian waters. Indonesia noted there had been some efforts to develop harvest strategies for tropical tuna in Indonesia’s archipelagic waters (discussed in WCPFC16-2019-DP20), and that further collaboration and consultation with SPC to develop a harvest strategy in their archipelagic waters was anticipated. Indonesia also asked for clarification on the reference to scalers in Section 3.1 of the paper. SPC affirmed that what was Area 4 in the 2016 stock assessment model was subject to the HCR, and that SPC was aware of the effort to develop harvest strategies for Indonesian waters, and that any future changes arising from this could be addressed, but for now SPC assumed that all fisheries in Region 4 of the 2016 stock assessment were subject to the HCR. Regarding scalars, it noted that large purse seine fisheries are scaled through effort, while others are scaled through catch, which corresponds to how the fisheries tend to be managed."
WCPFC16,283,"Samoa inquired regarding the use of a proxy for small-scale fisheries and wondered how that accounted for disparity in small scale fisheries between CCMs, which could significantly impact on the development of such fisheries in SIDS. SPC stated that currently the HCR applies across the entire stock and tries to maintain the stock against that in region. The assumption is that if the stock is maintained around the TRP then fishery conditions should be stable around 2012 level in the region. But this is indeed a proxy, and more information may be revealed through monitoring of the PIs. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  53"
WCPFC16,284,"United States thanked the EU for their suggestion, which it said it would consider. It noted the importance of PIs, stating it understood the desire for specific PIs, with the understanding that some are difficult to measure. The United States noted CCMs should be aware of what PIs have been tentatively adopted. In  addition to the six in the paper, others are referred to in the paper as “indicators that have been requested by CCMs”, but in fact they have been adopted on an interim basis by the Commission. The United States suggested that those decisions, which might be in previous meeting reports, be compiled, made readily available, and referred to and used where appropriate. The United States suggested the need for a standalone document that includes all indicators adopted to date, which is then made readily available on the harvest strategy webpage."
WCPFC16,285,"PNG, with regard to the EU’s suggestion, stated that while it may be technically more efficient to work on HCRs electronically, doing will not allow effective participation by all CCM. PNG referred to the amount of work that must happen before a more detailed discussion can be held among all CCMs."
WCPFC16,286,The Chair noted the importance of ensuring effective participation by all CCMs and stated that the issue would be taken up later during WCPFC16.
WCPFC16,287,"SPC noted the question from Japan and stated that variability is addressed in PI 8, and this enables examination of how the HCR performs around the TRP. Regarding disproportionate burden, he stated that the current assumption is that any burden is spread evenly; the HCR does not examine allocation. However, this can be looked at in detail in the multispecies fisheries HCR. Regarding small-scale fisheries, the fisheries currently considered under the HCR are those included in the current stock assessment model. To incorporate small scale fisheries requires good data. If there is a strong desire to include these fisheries, and data is available to allow this, SPC can look at doing this.  7.2.2 Review of CMM 2018–01 (bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack)"
WCPFC16,288,"Dr Graham Pilling (SPC-OFP) presented WCPFC16-2019-17 Evaluation of CMM 2018-01 for tropical tuna, with the following documents prepared for reference: WCPFC16-2019-13 Reference document for the review of CMM 2018-01 and development of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-06 (bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna), WCPFC16-2019-IP04 Summary of the Reports received under Tropical Tuna CMMs - from 2017 to 2018, and WCPFC16-2019-IP05_rev1, Catch and effort tables on tropical tuna CMMs. WCPFC16-2019-17 evaluates the potential for CMM 2018-01 to achieve its objectives for each of the three WCPO tropical tuna stocks as specified in paragraphs 12 to 14. The evaluation was based upon the latest SC-agreed stock assessments. The paper evaluates the adjustments from CMM 2017-01 to CMM 2018-01, and finds that, overall, the changes do not materially affect the management conditions assumed under the evaluation. However, while paragraph 18 (FAD definition excluding “small amounts of garbage”) was found to have negligible impact on the evaluation, any increase in the number of “FAD sets” due to this paragraph will “result in increased catches of bigeye and small yellowfin tuna”. As in previous evaluations, it is difficult to identify exact future fishing conditions resulting from the CMM. Therefore, two future scenarios were evaluated, representing “optimistic” and “pessimistic” future fishing levels under the CMM. Overall, the ability of the CMM to achieve its objectives for bigeye tuna was dependent upon the assumption made for future recruitment to the stock. Under the more positive “recent recruitment” assumption, all scenarios for future fishing under the CMM achieved CMM objectives, while all failed to do so under the less positive “long term” assumption. For yellowfin tuna, the “optimistic” scenario approximately achieves CMM objectives, but the “pessimistic” scenario does not. For skipjack tuna, based upon the 2019 stock assessment, the CMM does not achieve the corresponding objective, as the stock settles below the interim TRP of 50% SBF=0. The paper also evaluates additional requests made by CCMs at SC15. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  54"
WCPFC16,289,Korea noted that that in regard to high seas fishing effort Korea was working to reconcile differences between its own data and that of SPC and identify the origins of the differences. It stated that it would keep CCMs informed.
WCPFC16,290,"Tokelau, on behalf of FFA members stated their concern that SPC did not taken into account the requests made at TCC to evaluate the impact of all ""special provisions"" on the performance of CMM 2018-01, and that the evaluation still concentrates mainly on the SIDS special provisions. They stated that they understood SPC had not had time to complete the work but stated that the only equitable solution was for the review to be postponed to 2020. It suggested this involved politicisation of the SC, when some CCMs can ask for an analysis of the impact of certain exemptions and not others, and with no scientific rationale for making these distinctions. FFA members stated they had no interest in having the Commission’s science processes used for “national point scoring”, which they stated mars discussions in many RFMOs. They stated the special provisions for developing and small island states were not new, but were incorporated into the Convention for good reason and accepted by all signatories, including those invited to join the Commission following finalisation of the final text. They requested a review of the tropical tuna measure be postponed until all special provisions could be evaluated and considered by SC16, and stated that meanwhile the purpose of the measure is to provide a ""robust transitional management regime that ensures the sustainability of bigeye, skipjack, and yellowfin tuna stocks"" continues to be achieved."
WCPFC16,291,"The EU stated that it was normal and legitimate to expect that the Commission evaluates and takes into account in its deliberations the impact of exemptions in the fishery, and seek to base decisions on the relevant data. It stated that deciding on allocations in the high seas, especially for states fishing there with no limits, was important as this would impact stock status and could compromise the work and conservation efforts of the Commission. The EU also referenced the need to regulate FADs, and to harmonize FAD rules in the high seas and EEZs, because of increased FAD sets in EEZs."
WCPFC16,292,"Japan referenced effort creep, which it stated has clearly been seen in purse seine fisheries as a result of increased use of echo sounders and new technology, noting that almost all FADs were now equipped with echo sounders, which has not been taken into account. Japan noted the gap between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios was narrow and requested SPC to take effort creep into account during the subsequent evaluation of the CMM."
WCPFC16,293,Kiribati supported the statement by Tokelau and stressed that these were important issues for SIDS and were really the basis of having Article 30 in the Convention text.
WCPFC16,294,"Palau, on behalf of other PNA members, supported the FFA statement, and stated they were not in a position to consider the report, because, in their view, it was incomplete because (i) no scientific rationale was provided by SC for the choice of the specific provisions for which separate analyses were requested; and (ii) it does not deal in a comprehensive and balanced way with the various specific provisions in the CMM. Consequently, PNA members supported the FFA proposal that the report be referred back to the SC for further consideration."
WCPFC16,295,"SPC stated it was trying to get better analyse patterns of effort creep in the fishery, with a number of ongoing studies looking at FAD acoustic data, and thanked it partners in those efforts. It stated that although it was doing it best to examine the issue, it might not be able to incorporate this into the evaluation prepared in 2020."
WCPFC16,296,"The United States stated that while there were good reasons for including particular special provisions and exceptions, it was important for the Commission to understand the implications of these decisions. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  55"
WCPFC16,297,The Commission acknowledged the need to negotiate a successor measure to replace CMM 2018-01 which will expire at end of 2020.   7.2.2.1 Purse seine limits for high seas
WCPFC16,298,"Niue, on behalf of FFA members, referenced WCPFC2019-DP06 Views on High Seas limits and Allocation in the Tropical Tuna CMM, which presents the views of FFA members on high seas purse seine limits. FFA members stated that agreeing to a high seas limit and allocation for the tropical purse seine fishery was a priority as it was discussed in depth and agreed to in 2017, resulting in CMM 2018-01. FFA members stated that in their view a high seas allocation framework for purse seine fisheries would not include considerations of current limits that apply within the EEZs of FFA member countries. FFA members expected any high seas limits to be consistent with achieving the agreed TRPs and maintaining or reducing current catch and/or effort accordingly. They stated that the allocation framework should commence with setting an overall limit for the high seas, which is then divided to create a share of this limit that specifically recognises the special circumstances of SIDs as outlined in Article 30, and the rights of SIDs to develop fisheries in the high seas. To facilitate development of limits and an allocation framework, FFA members proposed that WCPFC hold a two-day workshop in conjunction with one of the meetings of its subsidiary bodies in 2020 with a view to the WCPFC reaching decisions at WCPFC 17. Sufficient budget should be allocated for the additional days to ensure SIDS are able to attend. In order to progress the workshop proposal, FFA members drew attention to the draft TORs for such a workshop developed by the WCPFC Chair (in her role as vice-Chair) during WCPFC15."
WCPFC16,299,"FSM on behalf of PNA members referenced paragraph 28 of CMM 2018-01, where CCMs committed to agreeing on hard effort or catch limits for the high seas, noting that such an agreement would close one of the major gaps in the Commission arrangements for management of the tropical tuna fisheries. They suggested some CCMs sought to go back on what was clearly agreed in paragraph 28 and considered it would be a serious lost opportunity for strengthening the management of purse seine in the high seas if that occurred."
WCPFC16,300,"Korea stated it sought additional fishing opportunities in the high seas, noting anecdotal evidence from its industry that indicated recent aggregations of tropical tuna appeared in the high seas more frequently compared to past years, and that the pattern is especially evident in El Nino seasons, and may reoccur any time in future. Under such a circumstance, Korea stated that if it had only allocations to fish in EEZs, and none for the high seas, it would be unable to fish, even if fish were present in the high seas. Korea stated its goal was not to change the existing system, but instead to explore the possibility of using vessel days purchased under bilateral fishing arrangements in the high seas, while making sure that such a system does not negatively affect the sovereign rights or aspirations of SIDS. If established, such a system would enable more flexible positions in future negotiations of high seas arrangements and allocations, and would give more flexibility to fishing operations. Korea stated that the Commission must ensure in any case that overall purse seine effort or catch limits are controlled within the upper limit that the Commission sets. Korea requested that FFA members carefully consider this idea and looked forward to in-depth technical discussions with FFA members and other interested CCMs."
WCPFC16,301,"The United States reemphasised that examining limits for the high seas necessitated looking at exploitation of purse seine fisheries across the entire Convention Area. It stated that the overall limit is driven primarily by the TRP for skipjack; the Commission does not know if that TRP should be adjusted, so all aspects should be addressed together. It supported the FFA proposal to pursue that work."
WCPFC16,302,"The EU agreed that allocation should be discussed prior to WCPFC17, but stated that this necessitated considering allocations in both the high seas and EEZs. The EU noted that these are highly WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  56    migratory stocks; and allocation must take into account the dynamics of stocks and the fisheries on those stocks, in line with international law (UNCLOS and the UNFSA). The EU agreed that Article 30 must also be considered and suggested that all nations fishing in the high seas should be considered DWFNs, and be considered according to the same rules."
WCPFC16,303,"Japan agreed on the need to discuss the issues in 2020, but expressed concern that it would be difficult to find time for separate meetings."
WCPFC16,304,"American Samoa made a statement intended to explain the relationship between American Samoa and the United States as it relates to the workings of the WCPFC. It stated that American Samoa is a territory of the United States, similar to a number of members (e.g., French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, New Caledonia, and Tokelau). American Samoa relies on the United States to represent the interests of the Territory in many forums but in the specific case of tuna, feels it is very important to directly engage the Commission. Like all Pacific Islands, American Samoa depends on tuna to maintain the economic and social health of its people. It currently has one fully operational cannery that employs over 2000 workers and has worked hard over many years to develop a locally based United States-flagged fleet of purse seiners and longliners to supply that cannery. The EEZ of American Samoa is surrounded by the EEZs of other countries, territories and the high seas and its fleets are dependent on maintaining access to those areas. The high seas are especially important as it is one of the largest fishing areas that is within an economically viable area of operation for American Samoa’s locally based fleet and has historically been very important to support the local canneries. American Samoa stressed that it had its own very specific needs to have access to the high seas for its locally based fleet."
WCPFC16,305,"Indonesia stated that according to CMM 2018-01, Indonesia has zero limit and that zero limit is in brackets, which means that Indonesia has the opportunity to utilize the high seas purse seine effort limit in the future. It also stated that in 2018-01 para 45 Indonesia is able to add flagged purse seine vessels larger than 24m with freezing capacity operating between 20°N and 20°S, by considering that Indonesia is a developing state that has the opportunity to develop its own domestic fishing fleet to fish in the Convention area. It also supported the FFA proposal to have a workshop to discuss high seas effort limit during WCPFC17."
WCPFC16,306,"China thanked FFA for its proposal and agreed such a meeting was needed to establish a common understanding of what the catch limit is. It suggested fishing days could be used as now applied for DWFN, but stated that fishing effort must not be increased, and negative impact must be avoided."
WCPFC16,307,"Kiribati stated it had already established a limit for its EEZ, and noted that as Palau and FSM stated, CCMs committed themselves in paragraph 28 of CMM 2018-01 to agreeing on hard effort or catch limits for the high seas. It stated that PNA members considered that it would be a serious lost opportunity for strengthening the management of purse seine in the high seas if CCMs go back on that agreement."
WCPFC16,308,"RMI reiterated the FFA proposal, emphasising it only wanted to look at a framework for allocation, and was not ready to discuss allocation at present. It emphasised the need to think broadly, beyond any meetings or workshops, and to use an equitable principle."
WCPFC16,309,"Tuvalu supported a workshop to address the issue, while noting that it is not in the same position as others in relation to fishing in the high seas, as the high seas are adjacent to Tuvalu’s EEZ. Tuvalu stressed that it was unfair for high seas allocation to be based on historical catch."
WCPFC16,310,"PNG thanked China for their comments on the success of the management regime applied by SIDS, while stating that the high seas were different, and urged CCMs to come together regarding their expectations from the proposed workshop.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  57"
WCPFC16,311,"CCMs held an extended discussion regarding whether and when to hold a dedicated workshop, and the TORs for a workshop. Reference was made to the TORs drafted at WCPFC15 (included in an annex to WCPFC16-2019-DP06). Discussion was continued by a SWG to develop a terms of reference for a workshop on high seas purse seine effort limits and bigeye longline limit allocation, led by Papua New Guinea,, which was unable to reach consensus and recommended that the Commission hold an extended meeting in 2020. The issue was further discussed under Agenda Item 7.2.2.3"
WCPFC16,312,The Commission agreed to consider the requirements of paragraph 28 of CMM 2018-01 at an extended WCPFC17 meeting which will be a seven (7) day regular annual session in 2020.  7.2.2.2 Purse seine EEZ limits for concerned CCMs yet to notify their limits
WCPFC16,313,"The Chair referenced WCPFC16-2019-IP04, Summary of the Reports received under Tropical Tuna CMMs from 2018 to 2019."
WCPFC16,314,"The Philippines stated that it was required to submit the limits of its purse seine effort and/or catch of skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye within its EEZ in accordance with the effort limits established and notified to the Commission as required under paragraph 25 of CMM 2017-01. During TCC15, the submission was considered unclear because the effort limit was in number of fishing vessels instead of fishing vessel days. The Philippines received guidance on the issue at TCC15 from other CCMs and stated that it sincerely appreciated that assistance. The Philippines finalized, after consulting with its stakeholders, its purse seine limits in its EEZ. This is set at 42,000 fishing vessel days in lieu of the original submission, based on the current capacities and conditions of the small purse seine fishing vessels operating in the Philippines Pacific seaboard EEZ. These include wooden hulled ring net/purse seine fishing vessels.  The Philippines referred the meeting to WCPFC16-2019-DP25 for the latest notification."
WCPFC16,315,"Indonesia stated that it is in the process of formulating the effort or catch limit of its purse seine fishery, with several areas still outstanding to calculate total purse seine effort in its EEZ and territorial waters, noting there is an overlap of effort for these areas. Two consultation workshops were held to determine the EEZ purse seine catch limit using the historical data of annual catch estimates and it was estimated at 68,935 tons, including skipjack 54,817 tons, yellowfin 13,850 tons and bigeye 633 tons (with a standard deviation of 20%)."
WCPFC16,316,"The Commission noted the notifications in reference to paragraph 25 of CMM 2018-01 on purse seine EEZ limits that were submitted by the Philippines, Korea and Chinese Taipei (in WCPFC16-2019-IP04) and the subsequent update from Philippines (WCPFC16-2019-DP25).   7.2.2.3 Longline limits for bigeye"
WCPFC16,317,"The Chair referenced two papers introduced under Agenda Item 4: WCPFC16-2019-DP06, Views on High Seas limits and Allocation in the Tropical Tuna CMM and WCPFC16-2019-DP10, Proposals on Conservation and Management Measures on Tropical Tunas. DP06"
WCPFC16,318,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members, stated that work should begin on determining high seas longline bigeye allocations. FFA members thanked the United States for their proposal (WCPFC16-2019-DP10) on the matter and the process they suggested. FFA members sought to clarify that before agreeing to any process and in particular to the allocation process, they would not agree to a continuation of flag-based, WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  58    convention-wide bigeye limits for longline, stating that agreement must be reached to pursue area-based limits that treat EEZs and high seas separately before embarking on any longline bigeye limit-setting and allocation process. FFA members proposed that para 44 be considered together with para 28 (discussed under Agenda Item 7.2.2.1) to be discussed in a workshop in 2020 on the margins of one of the meetings of the Commission’s subsidiary bodies. FFA members looked forward to working closely and constructively with all CCMs to agreeing on hard limits for the longline bigeye fishery in the high seas in the next 12 months, stating that such limits would have to be compatible with limits put in place by FFA members to manage longline fishing within their EEZs."
WCPFC16,319,"Japan stated that the situation surrounding the longline fishery was different from the purse seine fishery. Most of Japan’s purse seine fishing is in EEZs, but it undertakes substantial longline fishing on the high seas. Japan stated it was difficult to agree to such a drastic change from flag-based to zone-based allocation for longline catch. Japan agreed limits would have to be determined in 2020 and looked forward to an exchange of views."
WCPFC16,320,"China stated that flag-based catch limit on the high seas was a long-standing practice, both in the WCPO and other areas. China stated it was happy to discuss the issue. It stated its understanding that allocations could only be to members and stated the need for fairness. New Caledonia asked for clarification regarding China’s intervention. China stated that if tropical tuna was allocated to French Polynesia, New Caledonia, or Wallis and Futuna, it should be under France. French Polynesia stated that they preferred to keep each territories allocation separate, noting that the Commission should consider the needs of each SIDS and developing territory, as their needs and aspirations are completely different, and stated that France supported this view. New Caledonia supported the statement by French Polynesia, noting they have specific economic conditions, and wanted to preserve their right to fish in their EEZ. New Zealand stated that in relation to the points raised by China, under Article 43 of the Convention New Zealand had granted Tokelau full participatory rights in the work of the Commission and that further detail on the role of participating territories was provided in Annex II to the Rules of Procedure."
WCPFC16,321,"Korea referenced DP06, and its statement that “work should also begin on determination of high seas longline bigeye allocations. This will require changes to the current flag based big eye catch limits which should be re-engineered so as not to apply to catches taken inside EEZs.” Korea inquired whether this was intended to mean that (i) historical catch taken in EEZs should be attributed to coastal states? If so, Korea stated it could not agree, as it would entail drastic changes in catch limits for CCMs; or (ii) does it mean in future catch taken in EEZs will be attributed to coastal states? If the latter, Korea stated that was subject to negotiations between costal states and fishing nations."
WCPFC16,322,"Chinese Taipei stated that its longstanding position on longline fishery management was clear, and that it could not accept a change from flag to zone-based management. However, it welcomed the chance to discuss the issue in 2020 and onwards."
WCPFC16,323,Indonesia stated it favoured the current arrangement with regard to the bigeye longline catch limit. Allocations would apply only to the high seas and not apply to catches in EEZs and territorial waters.
WCPFC16,324,"The EU agreed with the plan of work proposed by the USA. It did not see the need for drastic changes in the allocations for bigeye longline fisheries, noting that even if changes were made it was not clear how this would impact the current fishery. The EU argued for the need to avoid drastic change to the rights of those involved."
WCPFC16,325,"FSM on behalf of PNA members supported the FFA proposal to replace the current bigeye catch limits with a more effective set of limits for fishing for bigeye. It stated that the current limits are of little value, being partial, with no effective monitoring; because they are based on historical catch levels, the WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  59    current flag-based limits inevitably come with a SIDS exemption, and any other arrangement would mean that the Commission is effectively determining who could fish in EEZs, and obstructing SIDS from developing the capacity to harvest their fair share of the resources, even in their own waters. FSM stated that the only fair and effective way forward was to move to zone-based limits, with limits for each EEZ, and a separate scheme of limits for the high seas. For PNA members, EEZ limits would be based on the longline VDS; the limits should be associated with a comprehensive scheme, to ensure robust monitoring and independent verification. DP10"
WCPFC16,326,"The United States referenced WCPFC16-2019-DP10, noting that other than adding limits for some CCMs, it was not proposing significant changes to the scheme for the longline industry. It stated that the intent was to establish catch limits for all CCMs. This would be done by first determining a bigeye longline total allowable catch (TAC), which would be based on (i) determination of a target or allowable exploitation for bigeye by all sectors, tied to a TRP, or informed by the risk of breaching the LRP; (ii) determining the proportion of this target to be allocated to the longline sector, using fishery impact on SSB as the unit of measurement; and (iii) converting the longline allocation into a TAC. It would then be necessary to specify how shares of the longline TAC are allocated among CCMs and provide a scheme for transfer of TAC shares among CCMs."
WCPFC16,327,"Japan stated that the proposal by the United States was an option that should be considered. It noted its support for a continued flag-based approach, and also referenced the option it provides for sharing between gears. Japan inquired how to proceed with this idea, and if the Commission could receive scientific input on how this might work, noting the need to discuss how to manage bigeye longline catch in 2020."
WCPFC16,328,"The Chair addressed the need for CCMs to determine the data needs for the proposed workshop, noting the suggestion to estimate how to share TAC between different gear types."
WCPFC16,329,"Korea stated its position that the proposal appeared reasonable, but expressed the concern that in case of purse seine fisheries, it is very hard to estimate bigeye catch in a timely manner, with the result that RFMOs control bigeye catch through effort rather than catch limits. It suggested that any new system should not bring too drastic a change to the existing system."
WCPFC16,330,"RMI asked for clarification that the proposal applied to the high seas, and inquired how the United States proposed to consider the FFA proposal in the context of its proposal."
WCPFC16,331,"United States stated that it was proposing a new idea with respect to allocating bigeye exploitation among the fishing sectors, but one that was very similar to what the Commission has done in the past, which led to the combination of longline catch limits and FAD closures. In that case SPC provided tables with various combinations of FAD limits/closure lengths and longline bigeye limits; the result was specific catch limits for the longline fishery, and specific FAD limits/closure lengths for the purse seine fishery. In DP10 the United States stated it was suggesting using a common unit of measurement for all the sectors (fishery impact on SSB) for the purpose of achieving a fair allocation of exploitation among the sectors, and then converting those sector-specific allocations to appropriate units for each sector – for example, catch limits in the longline sector and FAD limits in the purse seine sector. Regarding the question posed by RMI, the United States stated that the task in paragraph 44 of the tropical tuna measures is not a high seas-specific task; its understanding is that the task is to establish limits across the Convention Area. The United States stated that to accommodate the FFA proposal as part of the USA proposal would be difficult, as it was proposing something very different. The United States welcomed further discussion, but stated these were very different ideas.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  60"
WCPFC16,332,"Kiribati stated that in the discussion of bigeye limits, it was not in a position to agree to any proposal that would undermine its sovereign rights and would focus only on the high seas discussion."
WCPFC16,333,"The Chair stated that it was necessary to move forward in 2020 on addressing longline limits and purse seine limits as currently set in paragraphs 28 and 44 of 2018-01. CCMs discussed various options, including establishing a virtual workshop, having a dedicated face to face meeting, and holding an extended session of the Commission meeting; varying opinions regarding provision of data were also expressed. Agreement was reached that the Commission would discuss revisions to 2018-01 during an extended (7-day) WCPFC17 meeting. She encouraged CCMs to be mindful regarding the existing understanding that establishes a 30-day deadline prior to the meeting for submission of proposals."
WCPFC16,334,The Commission agreed to consider the requirements of paragraph 44 of CMM 2018-01 at an extended WCPFC17 meeting which will be a seven (7) day regular annual session in 2020.  7.2.2.4 FAD Management
WCPFC16,335,"The Chair referenced three papers introduced under Agenda Item 4: WCPFC16-2019-DP09, Joint T-RFMO FAD Working Group Recommendations for consideration by WCPFC16, WCPFC16-2019-DP10 Proposals on Conservation and Management Measures on Tropical Tunas; and WCPFC16-2019-DP16 Proposed changes to the Rules for the FAD Closure. DP09"
WCPFC16,336,"The EU introduced DP09, stating that it was proposing that the WCPFC FAD Management Options IWG consider the recommendations from the Joint t-RFMO FAD WG, evaluate their merits for the WCPFC, and continue to work with the Joint t-RFMO FAD WG."
WCPFC16,337,"French Polynesia supported the continued collaboration with other RFMOs, and consideration of the recommendations by the IWG on FAD management options. It noted that it is located within the Convention Overlap Area, and promoted greater consistency across the Pacific, especially in relation to FADs. French Polynesia stated its perspective that strong collaboration across RFMOs is a good way to address concerns such as limitation of the number of FADs, FAD definition, FAD identification registration and tracking, lost FADs, and beaching events."
WCPFC16,338,"Vanuatu, on behalf of FFA members, noted the number of technical recommendations and suggested it was most appropriate that these be referred to the FAD Management Options IWG to assess what is of value to their current work, and if needed, further guidance from the Commission. While FFA members supported cooperation with other t-RFMOs, in particular those with work relevant to WCPFC, it stated FFA members are very cautious of internationally driven initiatives that often pose more harm than good to the work of WCPFC, in particular to CCM’s rights as coastal states in the management of these fisheries. FFA members stated they would be very clear in the FAD Management Options IWG when deliberating these recommendations, to ensure the work of the FAD Management Options IWG and FAD management are not distracted by these initiatives."
WCPFC16,339,"Kiribati, on behalf of PNA members supported the statement by FFA members, stating they were concerned that many of the recommendations reflect conditions in regions with lower standards of FAD management than the WCPO. Kiribati stated that high levels of FAD fishing are causing the destruction of bigeye and yellowfin stocks in every ocean outside the WCPO. In the Indian Ocean, according to a recent Pew study, around 80% of the catch in the purse seine fishery is taken from FADs, and yellowfin is overfished and overfishing of bigeye is occurring. In the Atlantic Ocean, around 75% of the purse seine WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  61    catch is taken from FADs, with the result that the bigeye and yellowfin stocks are overfished. The EPO is a little different because of the amount of setting on dolphin-associated schools, but FAD use is high and increasing, and there is overfishing of bigeye and yellowfin. In the WCPO, by comparison, about half of the purse seine catch comes from free schools, resulting in less pressure on juvenile bigeye and yellowfin and other bycatch species. PNA members noted that it wasn’t always that way. When the Commission first met in 2004, 76% of the purse seine catch came from FAD sets and, if it hadn’t been for the FAD closure, the MSC free school certification, and tighter controls on FADs generally, the WCPO bigeye and yellowfin stocks would likely be in the same condition as those elsewhere. PNA members acknowledged that WCPO FAD management arrangements are not completely effective, and need to be strengthened.  PNA members looked forward to working with other CCMs at the FAD Management Options IWG to consider relevant recommendations from the Joint t-RFMO FAD WG, but don’t see it as a major priority for the meeting."
WCPFC16,340,"The United States agreed that in many respects the WCPFC is ahead of others in the management of FADs, but observed this did not mean work done elsewhere should be ignored, and supported the recommendations made by the EU."
WCPFC16,341,France supported the regulation of FADs.
WCPFC16,342,New Caledonia stated that its EEZ is entirely a national park. It said that FADs should be better managed to reduce the impact on the environment and supported the proposal.
WCPFC16,343,"The EU thanked CCMs for their support, and agreed with some of the comments, including the observation that the WCPFC is ahead of other RFMOs regarding FAD management. It noted several research activities that should be considered. It also observed that there was no meeting schedule for the IWG, and suggested that the IWG could meet and discuss these issues at TCC or another meeting."
WCPFC16,344,Nauru supported the comment by Kiribati and noted that PNA members valued the opportunity to work in the FAD working group. It supported consideration of relevant recommendations of the Joint t-RFMO FAD WG through the FAD IWG.  DP10 (FADs) and DP16
WCPFC16,345,Korea stated that there had been some progress in relation to the FAD management proposals in DP10 (USA) and DP 16 (Korea) following discussions between the United States and Korea in the margins of WCPFC16 and introduced the text of the merged proposal. The United States confirmed that it was withdrawing its proposal and welcomed discussion on the combined proposal.
WCPFC16,346,"Tuvalu, on behalf of PNA members, stated they did not agree the WCPFC should amend its FAD definition to align with that of the IATTC and other RFMOs as suggested by Korea. They noted the following: i. FADs are managed very differently in the WCPFC compared to other RFMOs. The IATTC and the other RFMOs have not yet adopted a FAD closure, although it is clearly global best practice for FAD management, meaning the definition and distinction of set types is an academic and scientific issue in those regions. ii. In the WCPO, the FAD definition is a compliance issue because it is an important component of the FAD closure. Therefore, the WCPFC must have a specific, tightly defined and unambiguous definition of a FAD and cannot use the inadequate definitions adopted by other RFMOs.  iii. There is a much greater level of fishing on logs in the WCPO than in the EPO. In the understanding of PNA members, the definition of some other RFMOs would allow fishing on logs during the FAD WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  62    closure with a significant increase in catch of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin. In addition, evidence suggests that the definitions used by other RFMOs do not contribute to better FAD management. iv. Importantly, most FAD fishing in the WCPO occurs in national waters under national laws, and PNA national laws do not provide scope for the proposals by Korea and the US, which would require changes to regulations and licence conditions in several PNA members. Thus, PNA members will require much better evidence of the need for such changes than provided to date."
WCPFC16,347,"Kiribati on behalf of FFA members stated they were open to constructive proposals to improve the effectiveness and flexibility of FAD management, noting that the FAD definition was in their national laws. In that respect, they appreciated the United States approach of suggesting a possible extension to the FAD closure, in association with a revised FAD definition. They noted it did not appeal to FFA members because of the adverse economic effects of the FAD closure, but stated they were prepared to develop, with the United States, a description of the work that could be undertaken by SPC for discussion of this issue at the FAD Management Options IWG in 2020. The IWG could examine scientific information available on alternative FAD definitions and associated measures such as the extended FAD closure and a pre-dawn set ban, subject to the fact that the definition of a FAD is embedded in CCMs’ national laws. FFA members noted that how a FAD is defined will affect fishing practices and ultimately catch or effort limits. They looked forward to a holistic approach to discussing the different parts of CMM 2018-01 measure and the best way to progress in 2020."
WCPFC16,348,"Japan thanked the United States and Korea for their combined proposal and raised two concerns: practical differences in terms of compliance and judgement, and possible impacts by changing the definition of FADs. It noted past problems with FADs caused by some extent by the FAD definition and suggested changing the definition could help inspectors and fishing masters avoid any unnecessary compliance issues. Japan also observed a change in definition could also have a potential negative impact on fish stocks, and therefore supported the suggested changes in paragraph C of the combined proposal. Japan noted it might not be possible to reach consensus at WCPFC16, but supported the direction proposed. It suggested that SPC could examine the impacts of the proposal, and noted that it understood the issues raised by the PNA and FFA members, while stressing that narrowing the definition could avoid unnecessary problems."
WCPFC16,349,"The EU agreed on the need for a clearer definition on FADs to reduce confusion regarding compliance. It agreed the proposal could contribute to globally increase catches.  However, it is not clear what is the magnitude of this increase and therefore the EU would need some input from SPC to better judge if it is accurate to support the proposal."
WCPFC16,350,"SPC stated that the evaluation performed was specific to the particular factors and indicators that observers noted in their logbooks (it looked at man-made objects). SPC observed that any increase in sets would increase the catch, and that the proposal mentioned sets on floating objects without FAD buoys, which would serve to increase the number of sets, and could also lead to a perverse incentive to place tracking buoys on floating objects after setting on those."
WCPFC16,351,Chinese Taipei agreed that it was very difficult to determine whether a vessel was setting on a FAD because of the ambiguous definition of FADs and encouraged the Commission to consider the practical application of the definition.
WCPFC16,352,RMI reaffirmed the position taken by FFA and PNA members regarding national laws and regulations regarding the definition of a FAD. RMI suggested that the proposal might only apply in the high seas in view of Para. 32 of the CMM. It also noted that a CMM 2013-06 assessment would have been helpful.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  63
WCPFC16,353,The United States noted that it had just come from a compliance meeting and stated that for a monitoring and compliance scheme to work it must be achievable and realistic. It noted that it is impossible to see a piece of floating trash from a distance of 1 mile and stated that the issue involved the basic credibility of the Commission.
WCPFC16,354,"China thanked Korea and the USA, and stated it had no problems in principle. It raised the issue discussed by Tuvalu, regarding the change in domestic law, and asked whether domestic laws would be affected if the measure applied only to the high seas."
WCPFC16,355,"Indonesia thanked Korea and the United States for their proposal, and stated they understood the reasons for regulating FADs, and how powerful FAD fishing is, especially when combined with the use of lights, and suggested these techniques should possibly be considered in combination. Regarding the operation of FADs, Indonesia noted that drifting FADs with tracking buoys are addressed, but anchored FADs may not need tracking buoys. Indonesia suggested any FAD closure exclusion should not include objects intentionally designed to attract fish."
WCPFC16,356,"Cook Islands stated, on behalf of FFA members, that they could not agree to the proposal to roll over paragraph 18, but stated their willingness to work with Korea, in 2020, on improving FAD management in a way that strengthens and does not undermine the effectiveness of the FAD closure. The United States also stated it was ready to work with other CCMs to find appropriate language to modify the measure."
WCPFC16,357,"Korea stated, regarding comments by FFA and PNA members, that the reference to IATTC’s definition was by way of example, and not to advocate for adopting the same definition, given the differences in the circumstances and characteristics of the fishery in the WCPO and EPO. Korea emphasised it was not trying to change the definition of FADs, but to change the rules for FAD closures, through an interim measure to address issues that had been experienced. Regarding the comments that changes would be required to national laws, Korea suggested it might be possible to mitigate or address those concerns by adjusting the list of floating objects in the proposal. Korea stated that it was concerned with the impacts of any changes on bigeye and yellowfin juvenile tuna and noted that in order for SPC to conduct more precise analyses, more precise text was needed in the CMM. Korea stated its preference to apply the CMM throughout the Convention Area, but if that was not possible, to apply it at least in the high seas. Finally, it stated the need to further consider the issue of anchored FADs."
WCPFC16,358,"Following further revisions of its proposal, Korea requested further input from CCMs regarding their concerns."
WCPFC16,359,"Tuvalu, on behalf of PNA members, stated they had given serious consideration to the latest revisions to the joint FAD proposal put forward by Korea and the United States. They reaffirmed that revising the definition was a serious issue for PNA members because the definition of a FAD is in their national laws and is not easily changed, and is also an important factor in the work of observers, and there would have to be a strong rationale to move in that direction. Tuvalu stated that moving towards practices adopted by other RFMOs with a record of complete failure in control of FADs and management of bigeye and yellowfin was not a strong basis for convincing lawmakers of the need for change. Tuvalu stated PNA members had considered agreeing to the application of some elements of the joint proposal in the high seas through amendment of CMM 2009-02, but noted that would explicitly contradict the important principle of compatibility, and had concluded that was not a good way to strengthen FAD management. For these and other previously explained reasons, PNA members stated they were unable to agree to the joint proposal to revise the FAD definition."
WCPFC16,360,"The United States stated that there was clearly a lack of consensus to address the issue as set forth in paragraph C in the Korea–United States proposal. The United States stated its understanding of the need WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  64    for compatibility, and for further work on the issue of FAD management, including regarding managing untracked floating objects. The United States stated it wished to continue to explore how best to manage FADs, and in order to better understand how to address untracked objects the Commission would benefit from additional data, as called for under paragraph C of the proposal."
WCPFC16,361,"Korea agreed with USA’s comment regarding information and para C. Regarding Tuvalu’s comments, Korea reiterated that the proposal was not an attempt to change the definition of a FAD, but to change the rule for FAD closures only. Regarding the national laws of coastal states, it stated that amendments might be needed, and acknowledged how difficult that could be, but noted that the CMM stated that CCMs would determine how this should be applied in their waters."
WCPFC16,362,"Kiribati supported the statement by Tuvalu on behalf of PNA. Regarding para. C, Kiribati stated it had problems with the language as proposed but would work with the United States on language for FAD management that could be used in 2020."
WCPFC16,363,"Japan thanked Korea and USA, reiterated its disappointment and concern regarding returning to the previously used approach and stated it would continue to work to find a better definition for FADs in 2020 in the context of the tropical tuna negotiations. It agreed with the perspective of the United States and Korea regarding para C and stated that unless the Commission had an improved assessment of possible impacts of changing the FAD definition, it would be very hard to consider the issue in the future."
WCPFC16,364,"Indonesia noted it also faced difficulties with respect to ensuring consistency between its domestic regulations and proposed CMMs, as commented on by FFA and PNA members. It noted it still faced issues with respect to anchored FADs and inquired if a solution could be found that did not require changing the FAD definition."
WCPFC16,365,New Zealand observed the need to avoid undermining the effect of FAD closures and suggested other means could be found to address the “chopstick” compliance issue that had been raised.
WCPFC16,366,"The Commission agreed the FAD Management Options Intersessional Working Group would meet in 2020 and that the Working Group would consider the report and recommendations of the second Joint t-RFMO FAD Management Working Group and report back to the Commission on the merits and relevance for tropical tunas of those recommendations.  7.2.2.5 Other commercial fisheries for bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin"
WCPFC16,367,"The Chair introduced WCPFC16-2019-IP05_rev1, Catch and effort tables on tropical tuna CMMs, which is a direct reference from TCC15, relating to the difficulty in assessing compliance with paragraphs 50 and 51 of CMM 2018-01; TCC15 asked WCPFC16 to clarify the interpretation and assessment of those provisions"
WCPFC16,368,"SPC stated that regarding the tasking by TCC15, it worked with the Philippines and Indonesia on a paper, but unfortunately could not complete the task."
WCPFC16,369,"Indonesia stated that TCC15 had a long discussion on the assessment of “other commercial fisheries”, particularly for Indonesia and the Philippines, and reiterated its view on these fisheries for bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin. It noted that tuna fishing in Indonesia has been practiced by local fishermen, mostly using small boats, for many years, which gives them traditional fishing rights that also have value in the form of traditional knowledge. Moreover, the fish resource utilization rights are regulated and protected in Indonesia by the Law on Local Government and the Law on Protection and Empowerment of Fisherman. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  65    Indonesia stated that catch limits for small scale fisheries will directly impact food security and livelihoods of small-scale fishers, and it will be very difficult to implement these in Indonesia. Indonesia is still having difficulty in determining the catch from its EEZ and territorial waters, which creates uncertainty in determining the effort levels of its tuna fisheries, including “other commercial fisheries”. Indonesia stated that it is trying to overcome these issues by improving its data collection system to obtain a reliable time series catch and effort data estimation by increasing the coverage of its port sampling, logbook and onboard observer program. To improve data collection Indonesia is developing an electronic fishing logbook system, which began implementation in October 2018. The e-logbook is obligatory for vessels above 30 GT and voluntary for vessels 30 GT and below. However, data improvement for “other commercial fisheries” remains a challenging process and source of uncertainty for Indonesia. Determining catch limits for these fisheries remains premature, because the exact catch baseline is still uncertain. Despite the challenges it faces, Indonesia has discussed the importance of “other commercial fisheries” with the Philippines and SPC, noting that the large range of uncertainties and the complexity of the fishery make it especially difficult to address the issue. Indonesia and SPC intend to have additional discussions on these fisheries in conjunction with the annual catch estimate workshop for Indonesia in 2020, and Indonesia proposes that Vietnam fully participate in the project with WPEA-ITM support."
WCPFC16,370,"The Philippines stated that it believed that handlines in the Philippines should not be included as part of “other commercial fisheries” because of the size of the vessels and relatively low CPUE for each vessel. It stated that the general understanding of commercial fisheries does not cover these types of vessel — by international standards, only vessels that are more than 24m in length are considered commercial. Current handline (using pakuras) originated in General Santos City sometime in 2000, and that from 2001–2005 the entire catch was landed in General Santos port. The fishing grounds where these vessels operated were mainly in Mindanao Sea (Celebes Sea), Sulu Sea and the waters in the Convention Area. Therefore, the arbitrary proportion of 20% of the total catch should only be applied to the landed catch in General Santos City. Eventually other areas in the Philippines started to operate small scale handlines, hence the increase in annual production. It noted, however, that the catch in recent years covers the total production of handlines nationwide, with only a small portion operating in the Pacific EEZ, even those that are landed in General Santos City. Thus the 20% estimated from beyond archipelagic waters in the Convention Area maybe applied only to landed catch in General Santos City. However, the Philippines proposed that this should be further studied, to enable determination of the actual catch from the Pacific EEZ, and stated the work was in progress with assistance from Peter Williams and others from the SPC. Beginning in 2020, the Philippines is planning to activate a system that will be able to track both the location and catch of each vessel."
WCPFC16,371,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, stated their continuing concern with the significant data gaps associated with non-purse seine and longline fisheries in the Philippines and Indonesia, and noted that while significant progress was being made, the absence of information for these fisheries was continuing to impede compliance reporting as demonstrated by the inability of the Commission to reach an assessment of these obligations in the final 2019 CMR. Australia stated that the situation also has substantial implications for determining appropriate limits and properly accounting for these fisheries in WCPFC’s management arrangements. The impacts on the Commission’s shared fisheries are substantial, particularly for yellowfin tuna, which is the most depleted tropical tuna stock. FFA members strongly supported the ongoing work of SPC, Indonesia and the Philippines through the WPEA project to improve data availability for these fisheries. FFA members recognised the challenges associated with these fisheries, and stated they were encouraged by the advice provided by Indonesia and the Philippines on steps taken to address these challenges. They strongly encouraged continuation of the work to ensure that WCPFC’s efforts to manage its stocks are not undermined. FFA members recommended that the Commission task SPC, in collaboration with Indonesia and the Philippines, to develop a paper containing all information on “other fisheries” to be presented to SC16 and TCC16, to review and advise the Commission with the aim of reviewing para.51 in the tropical tuna measure to ensure appropriate limits can be determined, measured and assessed in the CMS. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  66"
WCPFC16,372,Indonesia noted that Vietnam is also a full participant in the WPEA project.
WCPFC16,373,"EU stated it would work with FFA and encouraged the work by SPC. It noted the species ae highly migratory, and suggested all information, even from small-scale fisheries, is essential, and encouraged collection of fisheries data from those fisheries. The EU stated that TCC received some assurance from the delegations concerned that work would be done by WCPFC16 to progress the discussion, but observed that no reassurance was provided at WCPFC16 that this was likely to happen in the short term. The EU suggested making the tasking more precise, stating that it was necessary to define the data the Commission needs; and if the data do not exist, the Commission needs to know this so it can proceed accordingly. The EU also noted that the data available might not allow defining the levels indicated in CMM 2018-01"
WCPFC16,374,"China agreed with the EU’s suggestion that a clear reference limit on “other” commercial fisheries was needed. It observed that while Vietnam is included within the WPEA for the purpose of information exchange, its fishing area is outside the Convention Area."
WCPFC16,375,"The Commission noted the progress being made in Indonesia and the Philippines in respect of data collection for other fisheries for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack in their waters."
WCPFC16,376,"The Commission tasked the Scientific Services Provider, in collaboration with Indonesia and the Philippines, to develop a paper containing all information on ‘other fisheries’ to be presented to the Scientific Committee and Technical Compliance Committee in 2020, to review and advise the Commission with the aim of reviewing paragraph 51 in CMM 2018-01 to ensure appropriate limits can be determined, measured and assessed in the Compliance Monitoring Scheme.  7.2.2.6 New CMM for tropical tunas"
WCPFC16,377,"The Chair noted that CMM 2018-01 expires in 2020, and that a new measure was needed."
WCPFC16,378,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, noted that CMM 2018-01 is currently performing well, the stocks controlled by the measure are all within tolerances and the fisheries in the tropical area, particularly the purse-seine fisheries, are beginning to produce sustainable economic and social benefits for developing countries in the tropical area. The objectives of the measure are already expressed in terms that are easily translated into a harvest strategy approach and FFA members stated that it was likely to be fit for its purpose for another 3–4 years. They stated they saw no reason for significant change beyond addressing the requirements of paras 28 and 44. 7.3 South Pacific Albacore 7.3.1 Roadmap for effective conservation and management of South Pacific albacore"
WCPFC16,379,"Dr Graham Pilling (SPC-OFP) presented WCPFC16-2019-19 Alternative Trajectories to achieve the South Pacific albacore interim TRP. As requested by WCPFC15, the paper evaluates a range of alternative catch pathways and timeframes that achieve the interim TRP no later than 20 years. Following requests from SC15, the paper also evaluates effort-based management pathways that achieve the objective. These pathways are compared to “status quo” (2014–2016 average catch or effort) scenarios, which lead to stock declines. A wide range of management scenarios can be applied, and a small subset were examined in the paper. A recovery period of 20 years, the longest time period specified by WCPFC15, implies lower short-term impacts on fisheries compared to shorter recovery periods. However, the stock will decline in the short term if catch reductions are insufficient or management action is delayed. Overall management interventions would then need to be greater as stock recovery will be from a lower biomass level. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  67"
WCPFC16,380,"Samoa, on behalf of FFA members, introduced WCPFC16-2019-DP05, South Pacific Albacore Roadmap and Harvest Strategy. FFA members thanked SPC for the informative analyses on the catch and effort pathway options presented for deliberation, stating that it was clear there would be difficult decisions to make, especially on commitments to be made to achieve the agreed TRP, and asked all CCMs for their cooperation. They noted that South Pacific albacore is important to FFA members, who are committed to achieving the TRP in as short a time as economically possible. FFA members proposed reinvigorating the South Pacific Albacore IWG in 2020 and confirmed Fiji would chair the IWG. They stated they had taken the lead in providing revisions for the roadmap work plan to focus on three key elements: (i) an agreement on an overall TAC/TAE and a subsequent pathway to the TRP; (ii) a division of the overall TAC/TAE between the high seas and EEZs; and (iii) a measure for the implementation of overall TAC/TAE and/or subregional TACs/TAEs that recognises zone-based management, EEZ limits, data collection and reporting requirements until a harvest strategy is finalised and agreed. FFA members stated they were encouraged that China voiced their preference at SC15 for a TAC for this fishery as soon as possible. They looked forward to working with other CCMs, including through a face-to-face IWG meeting 2020 in conjunction with a meeting of one of the WCPFC’s subsidiary bodies."
WCPFC16,381,"Fiji acknowledged the work and leadership by New Zealand since the adoption of an interim TRP for South Pacific Albacore at WCPFC15, and similarly thanked CCMs that had been actively engaged throughout the process. Fiji accepted the appointment as Chair of the South Pacific Albacore IWG and sought the continued support and active engagement of CCMs in 2020 as it reinvigorated a revised Roadmap and sought to make key decisions related to returning South Pacific albacore stocks to the TRP. Fiji noted that the albacore stock and its fisheries are critical to the livelihoods and wellbeing of its people, and makes up more than 80% of the sector’s contribution to Fiji’s gross domestic product, through 93 fishing vessels, 5 processing companies, and the employment (directly and indirectly) of thousands of Fiji nationals. Fiji stated it has experienced low catches of albacore and the long-term viability of its fisheries and associated processing factories is grim. Fiji therefore called on CCMs to quickly work together to either (i) agree on harvest strategies, or (ii) adopt enhanced zone-based measures that recognize the existing measures adopted by FFA members in their zones, and MCS and reporting requirements, while finalizing harvest strategies. Fiji emphasised that any delay would most probably lead to the demise of their domestic industry and the thousands of people that depend on it. Fiji also raised a few key issues related to CMM 2013-07, specifically section 5 on the Support for Domestic Fisheries Sector and Tuna Fisheries Related Businesses and Market Access. These include (i) maximizing benefits from the development of their fisheries resources; (ii) that domestic fishing and related industries of SIDS in the Convention Area account for ~50% of the total catch and value of highly migratory fish stocks harvested in the Convention Area; and (iii) the need therefore to support investment and collaborative arrangements with SIDS and territories. Fiji reflected on the Harvest Strategy Workplan, and adoption of HCRs by 2021 for South Pacific albacore, and stated that one issue CCMs may encounter is the difficulty of remaining committed to this process. Fiji referenced the TRP adopted at WCPFC15 and stated that the sooner the fishery recovers to that point, the better it is for the people and national economies that are dependent on it, while acknowledging that this would not be an easy task, as the preliminary scenarios provided by SPC indicated. Acknowledging the differing development aspirations of CCMs, Fiji asked that the dialogue, decisions and collective actions remain focussed on how these shared stocks have created wealth and benefits for the people and national economies of CCMs, and reflected that this was an urgent call to action."
WCPFC16,382,"New Caledonia stated that its longline fishery is highly dependent on the South Pacific albacore stock, which accounts for 70% of its catch; there is low fishing effort in New Caledonia’s EEZ, and managers and the fishing industry have worked cooperatively for decades with good results, but yields have decreased for the last 3 years, with no apparent explanation. Possible reasons include climate change, the strong fishing effort that occurs all around New Caledonia’s EEZ, especially in the high seas pocket to the south, or a combination of these. New Caledonia stressed that South Pacific albacore is vital both for food WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  68    security and the fisheries industry. New Caledonia stated it would be fully involved in the work of the Commission on this issue and indicated the need to have face-to-face meeting so that issues could be discussed in detail."
WCPFC16,383,"French Polynesia stated that South Pacific albacore is its main fishery and is very important in terms of profitability and food security. French Polynesia stated it would also actively participate in the roadmap IWG. Given the topics that must be addressed, French Polynesia supported face to face meetings."
WCPFC16,384,"The United States stated that its fishery operating out of American Samoa is very reliant on South Pacific albacore, which is very important both culturally and economically. It noted that it was in the Commission’s best interest to reach the TRP as quickly as possible. It asked for more details on the proposed revisions to the workplan and supported in-person meetings of the IWG in 2020."
WCPFC16,385,China affirmed the importance of South Pacific albacore for China’s fleet and looked forward to discussions in the SWG.
WCPFC16,386,"New Zealand, as outgoing chair of the Albacore Roadmap IWG, thanked all CCMs for their previous engagement, and looked forward to further work on the issues. It thanked Fiji for taking over as Chair and agreed that the Commission should work to reach the TRP as soon as economically feasible."
WCPFC16,387,"Chinese Taipei affirmed the importance of South Pacific Albacore and supported the Roadmap IWG but stated it could not agree to replace the current workplan with the proposed workplan, and it would discuss further in the IWG."
WCPFC16,388,Samoa thanked all CCMs for their support.
WCPFC16,389,"The EU stated that it catches South Pacific albacore as bycatch and noted that it had some concerns with WCPFC16-2019-DP05, noting the need to take into account the principles of the UNFSA and UNCLOS. In this context, it stated it saw no reason to strongly differentiate between the high seas and EEZs. It suggested the need to review the IATTC’s albacore management, and the need for close contact with IATTC in order to ensure sustainable management. Cook Islands encouraged CCMs not to be selective in making references to the need for consistency with international law."
WCPFC16,390,The Commission agreed to reinvigorate the South Pacific Albacore Roadmap Working Group in 2020 under the leadership of Fiji and for it to continue to work intersessionally to develop the Roadmap for Effective Conservation and Management of South Pacific Albacore.
WCPFC16,391,The Commission further agreed that the South Pacific Albacore Roadmap Working Group would meet in the margins of SC16 and TCC16 and that during the intersessional period it would work to develop its workplan and terms of reference.   7.3.2 Performance indicators
WCPFC16,392,The Commission noted the progress on the development of performance indicators for South Pacific Albacore.    WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  69    7.3.3 Harvest control rules and management strategy evaluation
WCPFC16,393,"Dr Rob Scott (SPC-OFP) referenced to WCPFC16-2019-20 Performance indicators for comparing management procedures for South Pacific albacore using the MSE modelling framework (SC15-2019-MI-WP03), and WCPFC16-2019-21 South Pacific albacore management strategy evaluation framework (SC15-2019-MI-WP08), and provided a brief presentation on the current status of the MSE framework for South Pacific albacore tuna and the design of the HCRs currently under investigation. It was noted that empirical MPs based on recent trends in CPUE were currently being investigated but that the option to investigate model-based MPs had not been ruled out. The HCRs currently under investigation for south Pacific albacore are based on the average level and distribution of catches for 2012–2014 and apply to all fisheries. CCMs were invited to propose alternative HCRs that could also be evaluated within the framework."
WCPFC16,394,"In response to a query from Japan regarding how the Human Resource Development PI is assessed, SPC stated it is difficult to evaluate in an informative way. Some proxies could be applied: for example, if the stock is maintained around the TRP, that could be taken as enabling achievement of the human development objectives."
WCPFC16,395,"In response to a query from Chinese Taipei regarding PI 12 (regarding Optimizing Capacity), SPC indicated this referred to optimizing capacity of the southern longline fishery but stated that optimal capacity in a fishery first had to be defined before it could be evaluated."
WCPFC16,396,"The EU noted its understanding that SC recommended focusing on empirical HCRs and inquired if SPC had examined model-based HCRs. It inquired how a change in targeting would be addressed, as well as effort creep. SPC stated that questions were raised at SC regarding the HCR design for skipjack, including whether it should apply to all fleets in the fishery, and whether management should be through catch or effort. Regarding effort creep, SPC incorporated this for skipjack, and could investigate it for albacore. Although the recommendation was to first look at empirical approaches, the key challenge is identifying a CPUE trend that matches trends in the fishery. A model-based approach could be used."
WCPFC16,397,"China inquired regarding (i) a PI for continuity of market supply; (ii) how food security is evaluated; and (iii) regarding the time frame for finishing the work of the South Pacific albacore HCR. SPC stated that both PI 7 and PI 8 seek to address stability and continuity of market supply. SPC is examining how to evaluate Food Security as a PI and may employ a proxy. Regarding the HCR workplan, it is somewhat dependent on the next stock assessment, which is scheduled for 2021."
WCPFC16,398,"Chinese Taipei inquired whether predicted climate change impacts on recruitment should be used in the projection. SPC stated that there is significant uncertainty in the albacore framework regarding future recruitment. Climate change projections are long term (50–100 years), while the harvest strategy projection is for 30 years. SPC will try and reconcile these differences and include projected climate change impacts into the framework if possible."
WCPFC16,399,"RMI on behalf of FFA members thanked SPC for the update on the harvest strategy work, stating that while they understand this is separate from the work to achieve the TRP, they understood the importance of endorsing required PIs for it to proceed. They encouraged SPC to continue these analyses and through the national harvest strategy workshops work to update and build the understanding of CCMs (and particularly SIDs) on these key components of the harvest strategies for the South Pacific albacore fishery."
WCPFC16,400,"Japan inquired regarding changes in fishing mortality between a typical LRP and TRP. SPC stated that if a stock is at high level, the HCR simply says that either catch or effort can increase. Various HCRs have differing trade-offs; some maintain high biomass, while others have higher catch, but lower biomass WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  70    as a result. Japan clarified that an HCR is likely based on the assumption that the stock will stay above the TRP. If a stock decreases, either F or effort must decline, while the stock will require recovery (through a recovery plan), and inquired whether the same HCR would be applied before and after reaching the TRP. SPC indicted that in the case of albacore the starting point is below the TRP, based on the 2018 SA. A stock rebuilding program, based on progressive catch controls, will have the objective of achieving the TRP at some point, followed by management procedures to maintain stocks at that level. If the recovery period is, for example, 10 years, then there is no immediate need for a HCR."
WCPFC16,401,"The EU noted that the Commission was surprisingly discussing about “recovery” of a stock that was well above MSY levels. It noted the wide-scale mixing of South Pacific albacore between the EPO and WCPO as revealed by tagging, and that the stock assessment takes into account only the WCPO. The EU inquired whether there was scope to consider this mixing, and how it would affect SPC’s work. The EU also commented regarding PI 3 regarding maximizing economic yield, and noted that this was already taken into consideration by the TRP. the EU suggested that the PI was not well defined because the economic yield is being maximized for some fisheries, but minimized for others, and stressed the need to look at all aspects of the fishery. SPC stated that the issue of potential mixing in the EPO and WCPO was raised at SC15. The next stock assessment is scheduled for 2021; depending on the structure of that SA, it may be necessary to redesign the operating model. Ideally this would not have to happen but including the EPO would be a significant change."
WCPFC16,402,"In response to a query from China regarding the various periods used, SPC noted that these were chosen based on an initial inspection of values. It is not necessary to have consistent 3-year periods. The management period is assumed to be 3 years; CPUE is measured every 3 years, with catch values revised based on that, while CPUE is calculated over 5-year intervals. These were chosen as they seem appropriate but could be changed if desired."
WCPFC16,403,The Commission noted the progress on the development of harvest control rules and management strategy evaluation for South Pacific albacore.   7.3.4 Review of CMM 2015-02 (South Pacific albacore)
WCPFC16,404,"The following documents were noted for reference: WCPFC16-2019-18, Reference document for the review of CMM 2015-02 and development of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-06 (south Pacific albacore tuna); WCPFC16-2019-IP08 Trends in the South Pacific albacore longline and troll fisheries; and WCPFC16-2019-IP09 Summary of reporting received by WCPFC under CMM 2010-05 and CMM 2015-02: South Pacific albacore."
WCPFC16,405,The Chair noted that the roadmap WG would discuss future CMMs.
WCPFC16,406,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members, stated that as confirmed in recent meetings of the Roadmap WG, FFA members considered that there was no need to revise the existing measure, which had failed to restrict the build-up of fishing effort for South Pacific albacore, and stated that they were instead focused on the development of a new measure based on moving the stock towards the TRP and recognising zone-based limits to be established within EEZs and for fishing on the high seas."
WCPFC16,407,China noted the need for a comprehensive South Pacific albacore CMM and stated their hope that a new CMM would replace CMM 2015-02.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  71
WCPFC16,408,The Commission noted that possible future amendments to CMM 2015-02 would be among the matters to be considered through the South Pacific Albacore Roadmap Working Group.   7.4 Pacific bluefin  7.4.1 Harvest strategy for Pacific bluefin
WCPFC16,409,"Mr Masanori Miyahara, Chair of the NC, presented the NC15 outcomes with respect to Pacific bluefin tuna. NC adopted a harvest strategy for Pacific bluefin in 2017, and the stock is projected to rebuild in accordance with the HCR. NC15 held a long discussion on the possibility of increasing the catch limits for Pacific bluefin. He noted some members (notably Japan and Korea) face difficulties in controlling coastal fishery activities, especially given recent very favourable recruitment, and sought an increase in the catch limits; other members expressed concerns and preferred to wait for the results of the 2020 benchmark stock assessment. As a result, NC members did not achieve a consensus to recommend an increase in the catch limits. But NC15 agreed upon increased flexibility within the existing CMM (in the revised CMM), for 2020 only, an increase in the carry-over from 5% to 17%, the figure chosen for consistency of management measures between the eastern (IATTC) and western Pacific (WCPFC). The revised CMM also allows for a transfer of catch limit of 300 t from Chinese Taipei to Japan for 2020. The NC also agreed on TORs for the Pacific bluefin tuna MSE (Attachment F of the NC15 Summary report), and adopted Candidate Reference Points (Attachment G of the NC15 Summary report)."
WCPFC16,410,"Tuvalu, on behalf of FFA members, noted their continuing serious concerns at the extremely low status of the Pacific bluefin stock. They stated their concern at (i) the lengths Japan has gone to seek special arrangements to allow for increased catches in 2020, in particular a transfer of allocation from another CCM, although there are no provisions for quota transfer in the existing measure; and (ii) the dramatic increase in allowed carryover of underage from 5% to 17% of the 2019 annual initial catch limit for all CCMs. FFA members acknowledged that the principle of the Harvest Strategy approach does allow for the possibility of a catch increase, but stated they were strongly of the opinion that this should be considered in conjunction with the results of the full stock assessment and not to be the subject of lengthy negotiations of special arrangements favouring Japan during intervening years."
WCPFC16,411,"The EU expressed concern that the Pacific bluefin stock is still in very poor condition. It noted the efforts toward recovery and requested that NC provide more detailed information on this and other northern species in poor status in the future. In response the NC Chair reviewed the history of the NC, referenced prior requests by the Commission regarding presentation of NC measures, and stated that he would present additional information in the future if that was desired."
WCPFC16,412,"The United States noted that the NC had made a very serious effort to rebuild the Pacific bluefin stock, which is proving successful. It noted that the rebuilding plan allows for consideration of catch increases, if rebuilding is expected to continue with a high degree of certainty. The United States noted the NC was not proposing any catch increases in the revised CMM, but the revised CMM would allow for carryover, because of the economic implications. It noted there are no prohibitions to carryover of catch limits within the existing CMM."
WCPFC16,413,"Solomon Islands, on behalf of PNA members, supported the FFA statement, and said they appreciated the work that had gone into the proposal for a revised Pacific bluefin measure. However, they noted that with the spawning biomass at 3% of the unfished level and overfishing continuing, they considered that this was not the time to be making ad hoc adjustments to the CMM that would clearly increase catches in 2020. Given that a new assessment will be performed in 2020, any further action should WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  72    wait for the results of that assessment. PNA members stated they did not support revisions to the measure at WCPFC16."
WCPFC16,414,"Japan responded to some questions from FFA and PNA regarding the catch limit transfer from Chinese Taipei to Japan. Japan noted that WCPFC16-2019-22 contains the details; Table PBF-02 and Figure PDF-01(p. 4) show how rapidly the stock will rebuild. If the catch limit is not increased, the interim rebuilding target is projected to be reached in 2021 (> 60% probability), 3 years before the target of 2024, with a 97% probability of reaching the target in 2024. The projection assumes that catch made by Chinese Taipei would be more than its actual catch plus the transfer, thus, even if a transfer is made from Chinese Taipei to Japan, the stock is projected to achieve these targets as outlined."
WCPFC16,415,"Tokelau, on behalf of PNA members, stated that with the stock at 3% of its unfished level, the management of Pacific bluefin tuna is a failure that reflects badly on all CCMs. When the approach to managing Pacific bluefin tuna is compared with that used for other stocks managed by the Commission, PNA members think that fishing on this stock should probably be closed and closed for a long time. They stated they agreed, with some reluctance, to an HCR with a slow rebuilding programme and were prepared to continue to support the HCR. They stated that the proposed changes are not part of the HCR and are being made on an ad hoc basis without any apparent exceptional circumstance that would justify taking action outside the HCR, and that any additional management actions should await the 2020 stock assessment."
WCPFC16,416,"PNG sought clarification regarding paragraph 11 of the NC Summary Report with regard to the 50/50 split of any catch limit increases to IATTC and WCPO. The United States indicated that this restated the outcome of a joint IATTC and NC WG meeting, which were acted on by NC. The working group used a pan-ocean management approach and agreed that any catch increases must address the distribution of fishing opportunities across both commissions."
WCPFC16,417,"Japan addressed the comment by the PNA that the fact that the 3% SB/SBF=0 level means the fishery should be closed. It noted that while this could be done, PBF is taken by a coastal fishery, with most catch taken in inland and territorial waters, with 20,000 small-scale coastal fishermen and over 1,000 set nets. Closing the bluefin fishery would require giving up all other species in the multispecies fisheries and would negatively impact many fishermen. Japan noted while the 2014 recruitment was the lowest in history, it has since recovered, and 2016 recruitment was almost twice the projected level; these are now becoming adult fish and being caught. It stressed the NC decided not to recommend a change in the catch limit, and that the objectives, as endorsed by WCPFC, were being met. It noted the HCR was not being used in 2019."
WCPFC16,418,"The ISC representative clarified that the method used in the projection uses F as well as the catch limit to evaluate the probability of achieving certain targets. The model assumes Chinese Taipei catches 900 t or 1000 t, while the actual catch is below 500 t; thus, the transfer from Chinese Taipei to Japan would not affect the projection. Regarding the carryover increase (from 5% to 17%), it is difficult to simulate what effect this will have, but over time it will not increase total catch. He noted that not all countries are using their total quota and observed that the impact on the stock if they did could be negative, but would not be very large."
WCPFC16,419,China noted in relation to the ISC intervention that the stock is subject to rebuilding. It stated that in ICCAT such transfers are allowed and voiced its support for the transfer from Chinese Taipei to Japan.
WCPFC16,420,"Japan noted that some CCMs members had expressed concerns and suggested the need for more dialogue. Japan noted its view that prior consultation is very important and observed it had previously explained its domestic situation with respect to this issue to FFA and PNA members, including through the use of videos, photos and data.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  73"
WCPFC16,421,The Commission noted the update from the Northern Committee on the progress on the development of a harvest strategy for Pacific Bluefin.  7.4.2 Review of CMM 2018-02 and consideration of any proposed amendments
WCPFC16,422,"The Chair of the Northern Committee introduced the proposed revision to CMM 2018-02 as approved by NC15, with reference to WCPFC16-2019-22 Reference Document for the Review of CMM 2018-02 and Development of Harvest Strategies (which provides a quick reference guide to the recommendations of the SC, NC and TCC of relevance to the discussions on stock status and management advice for Pacific bluefin tuna) and WCPFC16-2019-IP10 Compiled information on Pacific bluefin tuna fishing effort and catch."
WCPFC16,423,"The NC Vice-Chair (USA) stated that the NC met briefly on the margins of WCPFC16 to consider two outstanding NC recommendations. Changes that CCMs discussed were largely adopted by NC, both for CMM 2018-02, and for the harvest strategy for North Pacific swordfish (discussed under Agenda Item 7.6.1)."
WCPFC16,424,"The EU stated that taking into account the constraints and difficulties expressed by Japan it would not oppose the revised proposal to amend CMM 2018-02. It commented in relation to the reporting requirement that allows some CCMs to report not in the calendar year but the management year, stating that TCC had struggled to assess compliance with limits in situations where this was the case. The EU stressed this was not a very meaningful way of reporting against limits and that its generalisation should be avoided."
WCPFC16,425,"Pew, on behalf of Pew, WWF, and The Ocean Foundation, expressed concern that the revised CMM for Pacific bluefin would increase the size of the allowed carry over and allow transfer of quota in 2020, which would effectively increase the catch of PBF for 2020. The stock remains severely depleted, at just 3.3% of unfished biomass, and continues to experience overfishing. They stated that any increase in catch further jeopardizes the recovery of the species, reducing the probability that the rebuilding targets agreed to by the Commission will be met. The changes to CMM 2018-02 approved by WCPFC16 did not change the effects of the measure and Pew stated it is very concerned that it was accepted by the Commission. ISC will perform a full benchmark assessment of the stock in 2020 and Pew urged members to take the opportunity in 2020 to fully debate the implications and merits of the measure."
WCPFC16,426,"The Commission adopted Conservation and Management Measure 2019-02, Attachment I* which amends CMM 2018-02 Conservation and Management Measure for Pacific Bluefin tuna.   7.5 North Pacific albacore 7.5.1 Harvest strategy for North Pacific albacore"
WCPFC16,427,"The NC Chair stated that the NC is developing a MSE for the stock; two stakeholder meetings have been held, and a TRP is under discussion. He stated that details are provided in the NC15 Summary Report (paragraphs 21–24)."
WCPFC16,428,The Commission noted the update from the Northern Committee on the progress on the development of a harvest strategy for North Pacific albacore.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  74    7.5.2 Review of CMM 2005-03 and consideration of any proposed amendments
WCPFC16,429,"The Commission considered WCPFC16-2019-23 Reference document for review of CMM 2005-03 and development of harvest strategies and WCPFC16-2019-IP11 Updated information on North Pacific Albacore effort data. The NC Chair stated that revision of CMM 2005-03 had been under discussion for some time. NC recommended slightly amending the CMM by removing the 6-month reporting requirement, which is not required by IATTC."
WCPFC16,430,"In response to a query from Vanuatu, the United States stated that para. 4 of CMM 2005-03 requires that “All CCMs shall report annually to the WCPFC Commission all catches of albacore north of the equator and all fishing effort north of the equator in fisheries directed at albacore.”"
WCPFC16,431,"The Commission adopted Conservation and Management Measure 2019-03, Attachment J* which amends CMM 2005-03 Conservation and Management Measure for North Pacific Albacore, by removing the reporting requirement set out in paragraph 3.  7.6 North Pacific swordfish 7.6.1 Harvest strategy for North Pacific swordfish fisheries"
WCPFC16,432,"The NC Chair stated that the North Pacific swordfish stock is in good condition and noted the following: NC15 agreed on a harvest strategy for the stock; and if the harvest strategy is approved by the Commission NC will approve specific management measures. The harvest strategy objective is maintaining the stock around MSY level. The exploitation rate (F-limit) LRP is FMSY. A TRP will be developed later. The F-limit rule is as follows: in the event that average exploitation rate for the most recent period has been found, with at least 50% probability, to exceed the F limit, the NC will formulate CMM recommendations designed to reduce, with over 50% probability, the F rate below the F-limit as soon as possible."
WCPFC16,433,"In response to queries from the EU regarding the use of FMSY as the LRP, the United States noted that, because a reliable estimate of steepness is available, the stock of North Pacific swordfish is to be treated as a Level 1 stock under the Commission’s hierarchical approach for setting biological LRPs. The LRP for the exploitation rate (F-limit) is thus FMSY."
WCPFC16,434,The Commission accepted the recommendation from the Northern Committee on a harvest strategy for North Pacific Swordfish (Attachment K*).  7.7 North Pacific striped marlin    7.7.1  Limit reference point for North Pacific striped marlin
WCPFC16,435,The NC Chair stated that NC15 had discussed a consultative proposal for a rebuilding plan and requested that ISC provide advice on which future recruitment scenario might be the most likely over the near term. NC15 also requested the ISC to explain why the striped marlin stock decreased and the fishing mortality increased after a drastic decrease in fishing effort by high seas driftnet fisheries in the early 1990s. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  75    7.7.2 Review of CMM 2010-01 and consideration of any proposal for a rebuilding plan
WCPFC16,436,"The Chair referenced WCPFC16-2019-DP12 Rebuilding Plan for North Pacific Striped Marlin, and WCPFC16-2019-24, Reference document for the review of CMM 2010-01 and development of Harvest Strategies for North Pacific Striped Marlin (Kajikia audax)."
WCPFC16,437,"The United States noted that the 2019 stock assessment for North Pacific Striped marlin found the stock is both overfished and experiencing overfishing, relative to MSY-based reference points. Given the concerns regarding the stock, WCPFC 15 strongly encouraged CCMs to submit a rebuilding plan, which the United States submitted to WCPFC16 in the form of WCPFC16-2019-DP12. The United States highlighted that the plan includes no changes to the CMM for North Pacific striped marlin; but it does contain a rebuilding target and a timeline and probability level for reaching the targets. The proposed rebuilding target is 20%SSBF=0 to be reached by 2039, with at least 60% probability."
WCPFC16,438,"FSM, on behalf of FFA members, stated that the issue was of major concern to FFA members. They thanked the United States for their proposed rebuilding plan and called on the Commission, with the support of CCMs in whose waters the fishery takes place, to take action as a matter of priority. Noting the proposed rebuilding target for North Pacific striped marlin FFA members stated that this at least represented a start, albeit one delayed for too long. They noted the proposed time frame of 20 years to reach the LRP, which was the point at which the Commission would ordinarily be considering taking immediate action to reduce fishing mortality and rebuild the stock. FFA members stated their hope that action could now be agreed upon and stated they would support a more ambitious timeframe to rebuild the stock to the LRP. They looked forward to some positive action with North Pacific striped marlin and other northern stocks that are also at depleted levels in order to align the stocks with the management of stocks in other tropical and southern areas."
WCPFC16,439,"The EU requested that the NC provide additional information on the stock to WCPFC17, including which members are involved in the fishery. Regarding the rebuilding plan, it noted that at WCPFC15 CCMs raised concerns about the status of the stock, and that a commitment was made that at WCPFC16 the most recent information along with a complete rebuilding plan would be presented. It noted that DP12 provided an objective and timeframe, but no indication of how this was to be achieved. The EU suggested discussions to determine if additional elements could be added."
WCPFC16,440,"Japan clarified that North Pacific striped marlin is not recognized as a northern stock, under the purview of the NC, but is to be managed by WCPFC. It thanked the United States for developing the proposed rebuilding plan, while noting that the 2019 stock assessment undertaken by ISC had quite divergent results, depending on which of two recruitment scenarios was used; ISC was unable to determine which scenario was more likely. Japan noted that North Pacific striped marlin stocks started declining following the cessation of high-seas drift net fishing in the 1990s when the fishing mortality was much higher, and that the reasons were not clear. Japan stated it could support the rebuilding target, but noted that the time frame and the probability of reaching the target were uncertain, and perhaps better determined following receipt of additional information from ISC."
WCPFC16,441,"The United States confirmed that while North Pacific striped marlin was a North Pacific species, it had not been designated as a NC stock, meaning it was up to all CCMs to rebuild the stock. The United States stated that in its view the rebuilding plan and actions needed to realize the plan’s objectives are distinct. The plan defines the objectives, but does not take steps to control fishing effort, which would be part of a rebuilding strategy. The United States noted the uncertainty in the stock assessment, especially regarding the recruitment scenario, and the projected recovery timeframe. The United States looked forward to working with Japan with the hopes of adopting a rebuilding plan during WCPFC16. WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  76"
WCPFC16,442,PNG supported the comments made by Japan and thanked the United States for the plan.
WCPFC16,443,"The Chair recalled that during WCPFC15 a lengthy discussion was held on possible designation of the stock as a northern stock (and therefore under the NC), but that this had not been done, and stated the Commission would not revisit that issue. She noted that ISC provided information and advice to the Commission. In response to further queries from CCMs, the Secretariat confirmed that WCPFC and ISC has a formal relationship and cooperate through a formal MOU the details of which are provided in the Relations with Other Organisations section of the Commission’s website."
WCPFC16,444,RMI inquired regarding the obligations of CCMs that are not members of either the NC or ISC.
WCPFC16,445,"Following further consultations among CCMs, the United States stated that based on feedback regarding the recruitment uncertainty, the rebuilding pan would be considered an interim plan, which would be updated following additional advice from SC regarding future recruitment. The United States then sought further input from CCMs regarding the timeline."
WCPFC16,446,"The EU thanked the United States and other CCMs for finding a way to make progress. The EU stated that their preference would be that the timeframe be 2029, because the Commission adopted a CMM aiming at rebuilding the stock 10 years previously, effectively making 2029 a 20-year target."
WCPFC16,447,"Japan suggested adopting 2029 with the proviso that the plan be subject to further consultations, in anticipation of further advice from ISC. The EU stated it could agree with Japan’s proposal."
WCPFC16,448,"Chinese Taipei noted that the current F was around FMSY, and that the species was bycatch for many CCMs. Regarding the rebuilding objective, it stated that 20% SSBF=0 was over MSY, and thus very high. They stated that if the Commission chose a 10-year (2029) target, there would be large impacts on those fisheries where the species is caught as bycatch. Chinese Taipei stated its preference was to use 2039, but that it would compromise with a target of 2034."
WCPFC16,449,"Japan stated it could support 2034, but would look to further scientific advice from ISC, probably in the form of Kobe metrics showing probabilities for various years; the best one would then be selected, taking into account socioeconomic factors. This could then change the target."
WCPFC16,450,"The EU stated that the stock is heavily depleted, meaning F for the current level of biomass is excessive. The EU also stated that the previous stock assessment stated that biomass estimates were very optimistic. The EU agreed reluctantly with proposed 2034 and stated that it should be considered again in 2020 based on the most recent scientific advice."
WCPFC16,451,"The Chair noted the support among CCMs for a 2034 timeframe to reach the target, subject to further consideration in 2020."
WCPFC16,452,The Commission adopted the Interim Rebuilding Plan for North Pacific Striped Marlin (Attachment L*).  7.8 South Pacific striped marlin 7.8.1 Limit reference point for South Pacific striped marlin
WCPFC16,453,"Dr Graham Pilling (SPC) provided background on recommendation points from SC and TCC on the review of the CMM for Southwest Pacific stripe marlin, WCPFC16-2019-25, Reference Document for WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  77    the review of CMM 2006-04. He stated that as a billfish stock South Pacific striped marlin has no agreed LRPs. SPC thus uses default MSY reference levels when reporting stock status, and on that basis the stock is likely overfished and subject to overfishing. SC discussed whether MSY is appropriate as a reference level for these stocks. It is a biological limit under which the stock may be subject to reduced recruitment, which triggers concerns. SC needs to advise on the setting of a LRP; a level of 20% of SBF=0 could be considered. Regarding geographic range, the current CMM applies S of 15° S. The most recent assessment raised concerns regarding catch between 15° S and the equator, which is not currently controlled by the CMM. The recommendation extends the northern boundary to the equator."
WCPFC16,454,"The Chair noted the two questions that had been raised by SC and SPC: is an LRP of 20% of SBF=0 appropriate; and should the boundary of the CMM be extended to the equator, and invited comments by CCMs."
WCPFC16,455,"The EU stated it did not share the same understanding; it stated that as indicated by SPC, the LRP must be biologically based, and indicate a limit beyond which there is a risk for a given stock to face impaired recruitment, collapse or something similar. The EU stated that SC should explore what that LRP should be and argued that it should not be 20% of SBF=0. It noted that this was used by the United States in its proposal not as a limit but a rebuilding target, and that the Commission had not agreed that there would be specific biological risk to the stock at that point. The EU stated it would be useful to expand the geographic scope of the CMM."
WCPFC16,456,Australia stated that a hierarchical approach to determining LRPs provides precautionary LRPs for species such as tuna and billfish. It stated it was comfortable with asking SC whether this could be applied to billfish. Chinese Taipei also agreed that SC could examine the issue and suggested more information would be useful.
WCPFC16,457,China stated that action was premature for what it considers a bycatch species. It stated that to decide whether to extend the CMM’s effective area to the equator it would require more information on the implications for China’s fleet. It suggested discussing the issues at SC16 and making a decision at WCPFC17.
WCPFC16,458,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members stated its concern with the stock status of South Pacific striped marlin, stating that the results of the assessment were worrying, indicating the spawning biomass is less than SBMSY and below 20% of SBF=0. Moreover, negative recruitment was seen in the three last stock assessments (2006, 2012 and 2019). While acknowledging it is difficult to specifically manage the stock, given that it is bycatch, FFA members stated it is an important stock for sport fisheries and thus tourism. FFA members considered this a priority and aim to bring forward proposals to address the situation at WCPFC17. For the SC15 recommendation to the WCPFC16 to identify an appropriate LRP for the stock, FFA members suggested this be referred back to the SC to identify a LRP and then be returned to the Commission for a decision. They noted the need for more effective measures to reduce the overall catch and stated this would be considered in developing FFA proposals for 2020."
WCPFC16,459,The Commission noted with concern the current status of South Pacific striped marlin and agreed to revisit the limit reference point in 2020 at WCPFC17.   7.9 Others — SW Pacific broadbill swordfish
WCPFC16,460,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, noted that WCPFC has an obligation to manage South Pacific Swordfish in the Convention Area, in a manner consistent with the objectives of the Convention. It stated that South Pacific Swordfish are a valuable resource and an important economic contributor to a number of WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  78    WCPFC member fisheries and presents a fishery development opportunity for SIDS) and Participating Territories in the stock area. Australia noted that in its current form, the swordfish CMM (CMM 2009-03) does not ensure the ongoing sustainability of swordfish in this region, the ongoing economic viability of current fisheries nor future development opportunities for SIDS and participating territory fisheries, noting that:  i. Between the equator and 20°S – There is currently no restriction on catch or effort for swordfish in this area, where catch on the high seas has increased substantially since CMM 2009-03 was developed. SC13 identified that the Commission should consider developing appropriate management measures for this area.  ii. South of 20°S – The most recent stock assessment estimated a 32% probability of overfishing. However, fully caught catch limits south of 20°S combined with recent catches north of 20°S would substantially increase the probability of overfishing and an overfished stock.  iii. Sub-regional depletion – The movement and aggregation behaviours of this species make it particularly vulnerable to subregional depletion, a key risk to the economic viability and development potential for coastal State fisheries in particular.  iv. South East Pacific management – there is potential connectivity between the south-eastern WCPFC area and the adjacent South East Pacific Ocean (SEPO). The SEPO has seen very substantial increases in catch, but has no CMM, and no stock assessment since 2011."
WCPFC16,461,"Recognising these issues and risks, Australia stated that it sought support of WCPFC members to strengthen CMM 2009-03, so as to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the stock regionally, ongoing economic viability of existing WCPFC member coastal State fisheries, and future development opportunities for SIDS and participating territories such that even stronger CMMs are not required in the future in response to an overfished stock, which could also impact tuna fisheries. Australia proposed that a future revised measure would apply in EEZs and high seas throughout the whole area of the stock (consistent with Article 3 and Article 5); be reflective of the current best understanding of swordfish science and its assessed status; prevent further increases in fishing mortality on the stock to avoid future overfishing and an overfished stock (consistent with Article 5); accommodate subregional zone-based management approaches and limits and ensure compatible management and limits on the high seas (consistent with Article 8); recognize the sovereign rights of coastal States to explore, exploit, conserve and manage HMS within areas under their national jurisdiction (consistent with Article 7); recognize the special requirements of, and avoid transferring a disproportionate burden of conservation upon, SIDS and participating territories (consistent with Article 30); and seek the development of a consistent set of CMMs for fish stocks that occur in both the WCPFC and IATTC Convention Areas (consistent with Article 22). Finally, FFA members noted the standing advice from SC relating to the need to strengthen provisions in CMM 2009-03 (Conservation and Management of Swordfish) and strongly encouraged Commission members to engage in discussions during 2020 to achieve this outcome."
WCPFC16,462,"New Zealand commended Australia for its proactive approach on the issue, stating it would be appropriate to approach IATTC with WCPFC’s concerns regarding the management of the species. It suggested the Chair write to IATTC with concerns regarding the need for a proactive approach to management of the stock in light of the concerns highlighted by Australia."
WCPFC16,463,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members also thanked Australia for the leadership role it had taken to improve the management of the stock and the consultative approach being taken to gauge the views CCMs. They noted that swordfish is of importance to a number of FFA members and express their broad support for the development of a CMM that recognises zone-based management and would seek to manage swordfish on the high seas to complement action taken within EEZs WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  79"
WCPFC16,464,"China thanked Australia for it work and stated that it agreed with some of the principles that had been addressed, including the application of the CMM in EEZs and the high seas. China also encouraged that WCPFC seek consistent measures with IATTC for shared fish stocks. It stated it would work with Australia to find a solution, although stated it was unsure if agreement could be reached in 2020. China noted that if a new measure was to be adopted China would find it challenging, but stated it was willing to work on the issue."
WCPFC16,465,"The EU also thanked Australia for its work on the issue, stating that proactive work was welcome, and that it supported addressing management throughout the stock’s geographic range for all species. It agreed with the suggestion to collaborate with IATTC in view of taking into account the situation in the SEPO. It stated it would work with Australia to develop a tasking for SPC, including defining the fisheries, which could be difficult, as in many cases, in the area between the equator and 20oS this may be mainly bycatch. The EU noted that to date the stock remained within safe biological limits."
WCPFC16,466,"French Polynesia supported the approach proposed by Australia for the revision of this CMM and stated that in particular because it is located in the overlap area, French Polynesia favours the development of a consistent approach to fish stocks at the Pacific Ocean level."
WCPFC16,467,"Chinese Taipei thanked Australia for tabling the proposal and agreed with the remarks made by China. It supported application to both area the high seas and EEZs, but cannot support zone-based management, as it held that limit development should be flag-based.  It stated it was prepared to work with other CCMs to discuss the issue."
WCPFC16,468,New Caledonia stated that it has a very low catch of swordfish as bycatch but was very interested in the sustainability of the stock.  It supported the proposal.
WCPFC16,469,The Cook Islands stated that South Pacific swordfish is an important stock for its domestic fisheries and looked forward to working with Australia on the CMM.
WCPFC16,470,"Australia thanked CCMs for their suggestions and support. It stated that undertaking projections (based on the status quo, fully caught limits, and max catch)1 would be critical for the robustness of the measure. It thanked the EU for assistance in developing text for the SPC tasking, while noting that, following meetings of the FAC during WCPFC16, this was no longer a funding priority for WCPFC. As a result, Australia stated it would provide a voluntary contribution to support the completion of the work by SPC."
WCPFC16,471,"New Zealand thanked Australia for its proactive approach, and for providing a voluntary contribution to ensure it could be done."
WCPFC16,472,"The EU thanked Australia for acknowledging the EU’s contribution in developing the roadmap. It raised the issue of timing, stating that a stock assessment would be conducted in 2021, which could involve significant changes in the stock assessment model. It suggested this would be very useful to inform discussions of any proposed amendments to the current CMM, and proposed that any projections be rescheduled to 2021, based on the new SA, with a management review of the fishery N of 20°S conducted in 2020.  1  Status quo assumes recent (2016–2018) levels of fishing both north and south of 20°S. Fully caught limits assumes recent (2016–2018) levels of fishing north of 20°S and CCM-nominated maximum total catch levels (para 4 CMM 2009-13) of fishing south of 20°S. Max catch assumes peak (2011–2013) levels of fishing north 20°S and CCM-nominated maximum total catch levels (para 4 CMM 2009-13) of fishing south of 20°S.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  80"
WCPFC16,473,"Australia stated the need to undertake the work on the basis of most recent currently available stock assessment, noting that the EU was suggesting waiting 2 years for the next assessment. It stated that this practice had not been followed for other species and argued it should not be necessary to wait that long to get the best possible scientific advice on how to proceed. Australia stated that SPC ran projections for tropical tunas in 2019, even though it would conduct stock assessments in 2020. Regarding the work on fisheries that take the species as bycatch, Australia stated that this would be directly addressed by the proposal, and self-funded by Australia."
WCPFC16,474,The EU stated that its view that (i) this was not a good use of SPC’s limited time because it would have to be repeated in 2 years; (ii) that the key priority was to understand the impact on the stock north of 20oS; and (iii) the stock was assessed to be above MSY with 100% probability. It stated its interest in ensuring that the timing be correct and limited resources be employed to do the work correctly.
WCPFC16,475,New Zealand stated it supported Australia’s position on the issue and saw no reason to wait 2 years. Cook Islands noted that the species was very important for its local market and observed that SPC had not suggested it could not undertake the work. Cook Island also stressed that Australia was proposing to provide the funding.
WCPFC16,476,"Australia stated it was confused and disappointed over the objections for the EU, which its suggested set a dangerous precedent, noting that the EU had a significant stake in the fishery, and thus has a stake in its sustainability. Australia stated that projection work did not concern current fishing mortality, but is about exploring whether the measure is effective under a range of scenarios and protects the future sustainability of the stock and that this work was critical for revision of the CMM.  Australia expressed concern that while there is a relatively new stock assessment, the CMM has not been considered or updated since 2009 and therefore the CMM is not reflective of the best available science. Australia stated that it was simply trying to ensure the Commission had the information to understand the current measure and help WCPFC members draft a new measure. Australia reiterated that the proposed work was not about current catch but rather about the future sustainability of the stock, the future economic viability of coastal state fisheries reliant on this stock (noting that coastal state domestic fleets cannot simply move to another region of the Pacific or another Ocean if depletion becomes too high) and for SIDS and developing territories – the future of their fishery development opportunities."
WCPFC16,477,SPC confirmed it could conduct the projections as part of its workload for 2020.
WCPFC16,478,"The EU stated that it was supporting the work and roadmap but wanted to implement it stepwise, starting with the core issue in 2020 and pursuing it in 2021, noting that SC had not raised it as a concern or priority, with their advice recommending maintaining the current measure S of 20° S, and taking appropriate measure N of 20° S."
WCPFC16,479,"Niue supported Australia’s proposal and thanked it for funding the work and expressed concern regarding the proposed delay. New Zealand registered its disappointment, as did Cook Islands, which stated that it was investing in swordfish research through small contributions, and was seeking to take a precautionary approach, noting that it could not move its islands the way other CCMs can move their vessels."
WCPFC16,480,"CCMs held an extended discussion regarding the possible timing of the three actions put forward by Australia in its revised proposal. Many CCMs voiced their support for the work and schedule proposed by Australia; Australia thanked the various CCMs for their support for what it characterised as an important action that the Commission could undertake at no cost. The EU stated its view that not all CCMs’ comments necessarily reflected the actual status of the stock and supported conducting projections in 2021.The EU reiterated its position that any stock projections to be conducted by SPC be based on a the forthcoming stock assessment, while supporting conducting the tasks in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Australia’s proposal in 2020, WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  81    which it stated were most important, and were supported by SC. Tokelau voiced its strong concern over the EU’s position, noting that the fishery was very important for some small Pacific Islands, which it stated were seeking to manage the stock sustainably for their people, through an approach consistent with that employed for skipjack and other stocks.  The EU expressed its concern with what seemed to be a lack of consistency in some CCMs position and indicated that for example, north Pacific striped marlin which is severely depleted did not trigger much enthusiasm or eagerness to address urgently its dire conservation status. Unfortunately, the EU proposal for an ambitious rebuilding plan for that species did not gather any support, whereas southwest Pacific swordfish, which is assessed to be above MSY with 100% probability, triggered reactions from some FFA members that did not seem to take into account key facts such as the stock status and scientific advice."
WCPFC16,481,"The Commission tasked the Scientific Committee in 2021 (SC17) to provide an evaluation of the long-term future of the southwest Pacific swordfish stock status under CMM 2009-03 based upon the latest SC-agreed stock assessment, utilising a limited number of projections. Projections should include: a. “Status quo” – this projection will assume recent (2016 to 2018) levels of fishing both north and south of 20°S.  b. “Fully caught limits” – this projection will assume recent (2016 to 2018) levels of fishing north of 20°S and CCM-nominated maximum total catch levels (para 4 CMM 2009-13) of fishing south of 20°S. c. “Max catch” - this projection will assume peak (2011 to 2013) levels of fishing north 20°S and CCM nominated maximum total catch levels (para 4 CMM 2009-13) of fishing south of 20°S. d. An additional limited number of projections which assume a range of fixed catch scenarios that are a percentage above and below “status quo” (such as -10% and +10%) that result in a range of upward and downward longterm biomass trends. WCPFC16 noted that this work would be funded via a voluntary contribution by Australia so as to not impact on Commission budget allocations for other priority work."
WCPFC16,482,"The Commission tasked the Scientific Committee in 2020 (SC16) to consider a review (self-funded and developed by Australia, in consultation with interested CCMs) of possible measures and options relevant to the management of swordfish taken as bycatch in longline fisheries. The review may include information from available research and literature, logbook and observer data (in appropriately aggregated forms)."
WCPFC16,483,"The Commission requested the WCPFC Chair to write to the IATTC Chair to: a. Express the Commission’s significant concern over the lack of scientific assessment and specific management measures for South Pacific Swordfish in the IATTC area;  b. Seek that the IATTC prioritise the development of a management measure that ensures catch levels are maintained within sustainable levels, and c. Urge cooperation between IATTC and WCPFC on this issue.   WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  82    AGENDA ITEM 8 — WCPO SHARK STOCKS AND BYCATCH MITIGATION  8.1 Review of existing shark measures and consideration of limit reference points for sharks"
WCPFC16,484,The Commission noted that the Scientific Committee is working on appropriate LRPs under Project 103 and encouraged the Scientific Committee to develop appropriate LRPs given their importance in harvest strategies.  8.2 Proposal for a comprehensive CMM for sharks and rays
WCPFC16,485,The Shark IWG Chair reviewed the efforts undertaken by the working group and presented a final draft CMM for sharks.
WCPFC16,486,"New Zealand, joined by China, thanked the Shark IWG Chair for his hard work and supported adoption of the CMM."
WCPFC16,487,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, welcomed the work done over the preceding two years to consolidate the broad suite of shark measures into a single, comprehensive measure. They congratulated Japan for its leadership on this difficult but worthwhile task. FFA members advocated for a process to consolidate the measures to ensure that the Commission is meeting its goals of mitigating the impact of tuna fisheries on sharks stocks effectively. In particular, they welcomed the efforts by Japan to look for alternative methods to ensure full utilisation of sharks, which has always been a key goal of WCPFC’s shark CMMs. They noted this as a significant step forward for the Commission, stating they were very pleased to adopt the CMM and welcomed the constructive engagement of all CCMs in developing the comprehensive shark and ray CMM."
WCPFC16,488,"The EU congratulated the Chair of the Shark IWG, and complemented him for his competence, resilience and patience. The EU stated that the adoption of the new CMM on sharks is an important step forward towards the sustainable management of sharks. However, the new measure still has some potential gaps that should be improved in the future, notably taking into account lessons learned on the implementation of the monitoring procedures enabling inspectors to identify and match carcasses and corresponding fins. It asked whether the Mobulid ray text should be incorporated in the CMM. The Shark IWG Chair stated he had considered this but stated that it would be very cumbersome to update the comprehensive CMM each time a new CMM is adopted. He suggested the Commission consider updating the comprehensive Shark CMM every 3 or 5 years."
WCPFC16,489,"PNG, on behalf of the PNA, stated they appreciated the hard work and the huge effort by the Shark IWG Chair, and joined in voicing appreciation and support to the Shark IWG chair, and voiced support for adopting the measure."
WCPFC16,490,Chinese Taipei stated sharks are very important to it and it voiced its congratulations to the Shark IWG Chair for a difficult task and expressed its support for the new CMM.
WCPFC16,491,"In adopting this CMM, Japan stated that the main reason for supporting this CMM was that WCPFC has the high-seas boarding and inspection scheme and the adoption of this CMM should not be a precedent for Japan in other RFMOs without such scheme."
WCPFC16,492,"WWF, on behalf of WWF, Pew, SFP, and The Ocean Foundation stated that sharks and rays continue to make up a large percentage of annual bycatch, which current stock assessment trends suggest is unsustainable. They stated that in the last 9 months, both shortfin and longfin mako sharks have been WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  83    upgraded to endangered and the previous day oceanic whitetip was elevated to critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. The recent stock assessment for oceanic whitetip shark presented at SC15 highlighted a dramatic collapse in what was once one of the most abundant pelagic sharks in the Pacific. Spawning stock biomass is estimated to be likely less than 5% of its unfished biomass and the species is predicted to become extinct in the WCPO under current levels of fishing mortality despite a no-retention measure. With that in mind, WWF stated it continued to support recommendations from SC15 for oceanic whitetip shark, including improved observer coverage and data; further efforts to mitigate catch, including closer adherence to the best practices in safe release; and the urgent development of a precautionary LRP for the stock. Overall, WWF stated they remain increasingly concerned about shark conservation and sustainability in the WCPO region but suggested that urgent action is required to further reduce fishing mortality on oceanic whitetip so as to enable the population to rebuild. They stated they appreciated the progress the Shark IWG had made toward agreed recommendations for a Comprehensive Shark CMM at WCPFC16, and they noted several important provisions were removed or watered down. They supported recommendations within the proposed CMM to include methods to further prohibit finning and incorporate the necessary language to encourage CCMs to land sharks with their fins naturally attached, specifically the elimination of the 5% fin to carcass ratio that was proven repeatedly to be ineffective. They also supported recommendations such as those for capacity building. However, they stated they were very disappointed that the provisions to prohibit both shark lines and wire leads, which the best available science suggests would further reduce the mortality of vulnerable species like oceanic whitetip shark, were not adopted. They suggested that because the Commission is unable to implement simple mitigation measures such as these to avoid unnecessary mortality of oceanic whitetip shark and other vulnerable species, other measures to reduce fishing mortality, such as time and area closures, should be explored as a matter of priority. Lastly, they stated their disappointment that, despite the framing of this measure as a “comprehensive” or “omnibus” measure, the final version of the Shark CMM lacks key components of good fisheries management practice. WWF urged the Commission to consider amending this measure to include: (i) a directive to establish recovery plans as the appropriate management response for heavily depleted species, and (ii) a mechanism and requirement to establish LRPs for all key shark and ray species consistent with the WCPF Convention."
WCPFC16,493,"The Commission adopted Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks (Conservation and Management Measure 2019-04, Attachment M*). The Commission further agreed that this measure would become effective on 01 November 2020 and that it shall replace CMM 2010-07 Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks, CMM 2011-04 Conservation and Management Measure for Oceanic Whitetip Sharks, CMM 2012-04 Conservation and Management Measure for the protection of whale sharks from purse seine operations, CMM 2013-08 Conservation and Management Measure for Silky Sharks, and CMM 2014-05 Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks at that time."
WCPFC16,494,The Commission also agreed that there would be an additional twelve-month period before Indonesia is expected to implement the new shark conservation and management measure.  8.3 Review of CMM 2018-03 on Seabirds
WCPFC16,495,"New Zealand introduced the review of CMM 2018-03 by stating it has the highest global diversity of albatross and petrel species in the world, with several species assessed as being at high or very high risk from commercial fisheries bycatch, and as a result the protection of seabirds is of great importance to New Zealand. Bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries is one of the greatest threats to seabirds, particularly albatrosses and petrels. New Zealand stated its concern that despite the implementation of a CMM since 2006 to reduce seabird bycatch, Project 68 estimates bycatch levels as high as 13,000–19,000 birds per year, not including cryptic mortality. This includes a high proportion of seabird bycatch in the northern Pacific. SC, reflecting estimates from Project 68, noted that longline fisheries north of 20°N accounted for WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  84    approximately two-thirds of total seabird mortalities, while longline fisheries south of 30°S accounted for approximately one-quarter of seabird mortalities. New Zealand emphasised the need to consider ways to reduce seabird bycatch and mortality as a result of longline fishing, and accordingly proposed adoption of non-binding guidelines for the handling and safe release of seabirds, as outlined in WCPFC16-2019-DP07, Proposal on guidelines for the safe-handling and release of seabirds. The proposed guidelines represent best practice advice developed by ACAP. The guidelines were endorsed by SC15, and New Zealand also highlighted the proposal at TCC15. New Zealand also stated it was grateful for the support of its FFA partners. The proposal aims to meet the requirements of paragraph 11 of CMM 2018-03 — ensuring that seabirds captured alive are released alive in as good a condition as possible. Wherever possible, hooks are removed without jeopardizing the life of the seabird concerned. As noted by SC15 some seabirds are captured and released alive, with higher chances of survival when safe handling procedures are implemented. Together with the implementation of effective seabird bycatch mitigation measures, safe handling and release of seabirds will help reduce the impact of pelagic longline and other hook fisheries bycatch on these vulnerable seabirds. The proposed advice has been tailored for fishing vessel crews and is freely available in multiple languages. The guidelines are simple, and the materials required to safely release seabirds (i.e. towels/blanket, pliers, net, box/bin and gloves) are likely to be available on most longline vessels. New Zealand stated its hope that WCPFC could adopt the guidelines as a further step towards the protection of vulnerable seabirds affected by longline fishing."
WCPFC16,496,"New Zealand further stated that CMM 2018-03 included the addition of hook-shielding devices to the list of acceptable measures to reduce seabird bycatch south of 30°S, and expanded the area to be covered by seabird mitigation measures from 30°S to 25°S with effect from 1 Jan 2020. It also noted that improved observer coverage is needed in key longline fleets in high latitude areas (both north and south) in order to obtain better estimates of seabird bycatch over time and over a wider geographic range, and that electronic monitoring will be helpful in this regard. Continued support for research on seabird bycatch mitigation methods in longline fisheries is needed, as well as attention to assessing compliance against the requirements of CMM 2018-03."
WCPFC16,497,"Fiji, on behalf of FFA members stated that SC 15 noted that some seabirds are captured and released alive, with higher chances of survival when safe handling procedures are implemented. The implementation of effective seabird bycatch mitigation measures, safe handling and release of seabirds will help reduce the impact of pelagic longline and other hook fisheries bycatch on these vulnerable species. FFA members supported New Zealand’s proposal for the adoption of non-binding safe handling and release guidelines for seabirds, as well as the other seabird-related recommendations from SC15. FFA members also reminded CCMs that the revision of paragraph 1 of the CMM 2018-03 to include hook-shielding devices as a mitigation measure will come into effect on 1st January 2020."
WCPFC16,498,"The EU supported the adoption of additional measures as proposed by New Zealand. New Caledonia, French Polynesia and RMI also voiced their full support."
WCPFC16,499,"Indonesia supported the proposal and understands the importance of preserving the biodiversity of seabirds. It acknowledged the strong efforts of New Zealand and FFA members, and thanked ACAP for translating the guidelines into Bahasa Indonesia so these could be distributed."
WCPFC16,500,"Korea thanked New Zealand, stating that it provided some suggestions to New Zealand to improve the guidelines, but that it understood that these come from ACAP originally, and that it could be difficult to reflect these suggestions in a short time period, while encouraging New Zealand and ACAP to work together in the coming years to make improvements based on their suggestions. Korea supported the proposal.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  85"
WCPFC16,501,"China also thanked New Zealand, stating it could support the guidelines. China noted that its industry found that branch line weighting reduced fishing efficiency by some 20%, while new hooks are too expensive."
WCPFC16,502,Chinese Taipei also supported the proposal.
WCPFC16,503,"The representative of ACAP welcomed and supported the New Zealand proposal.  ACAP notedthat, following the welcome adoption of CMM 2018-03 in 2018 the challenge would be ensuring compliance with the measure, as discussed in WCPFC16-2019-OP08, and that compliance is at the heart of any mitigation. Mitigation measures have had a demonstrated impact in reducing seabird bycatch, meaning that the conservation crisis for albatrosses and petrels can be positively addressed. ACAP stated that it produces useful tools in the form of proactive advice and fact sheets, with translated versions available on its website; ACAP has prepared guidelines on the safe release of seabirds from hooks, and information relevant to injured birds. ACAP welcomed submission by delegations of suggestions for their next update. ACAP noted the financial support from the FAO Common Oceans project ACAP is also working on new entangled bird release guidelines, which would be useful for the purse seine fishery, and on an updated seabird ID guide. ACAP stated that it would celebrate the first World Albatross Day on 19 June 2020 and invited all countries to commemorate this occassion."
WCPFC16,504,"The EU introduced, as presented in WCPFC16-2019-DP26 EU Proposal for two WCPFC16 Decisions on Seabirds (rev 2), the following two recommendations from SC15 (Summary Report, paragraph 581), and asked that the Commission consider these for adoption:  i. WCPFC notes that, in view of analysing the effectiveness of night setting within the seabird bycatch mitigation measure, the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) set time will need to be provided or obtainable from the WCPFC ROP longline data field.  ii. WCPFC consider supporting the analysis of overlap between fishing effort distribution and species-specific seabird distribution (as outlined in SP15-EB-WP-03) to both the WCPO Southern and Northern Hemispheres and to support an assessment of risk to populations resulting from fisheries- induced mortalities."
WCPFC16,505,"The Commission adopted the Safe handling and release guidelines for seabirds as a Supplement to CMM 2018-04, Attachment N*)."
WCPFC16,506,"WCPFC16 noted that, in view of analysing the effectiveness of night setting within the seabird bycatch mitigation measure, the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) set time will need to be provided or obtainable from the WCPFC ROP longline data field."
WCPFC16,507,WCPFC16 supported the analysis of overlap between fishing effort distribution and species-specific seabird distribution (as outlined in SC15-EB-WP-03) to both the WCPO Southern and Northern Hemispheres and to support an assessment of risk to populations resulting from fisheries- induced mortalities.   8.4 Others 8.4.1 Proposal by FFA in WCPFC16-2019-DP02 for a CMM on Mobulid Rays
WCPFC16,508,"Australia discussed changes to the proposal in WCPFC16-2019-DP02_Rev1, Proposal for a Conservation and Management Measure on Mobulid Rays caught in association with fisheries in the WCPFC Convention Area, which was first introduced under Agenda Item 4.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  86"
WCPFC16,509,"Japan thanked Australia, but expressed concern regarding the scientific basis for the paper, and specifically the reference to the listing by CITES, which Japan had opposed. Japan stated it wanted to see information from SC regarding the status of Mobulid rays."
WCPFC16,510,"Tuvalu, on behalf of PNA members stated it supported the proposal and thanked FFA members for developing it and Australia for developing the revisions as proposed. FFA members stated that the proposed measure would protect those species that are extremely vulnerable to the effects of fishing and would require careful handling of any Mobulid rays that are taken unintentionally as bycatch. The proposed measure would also improve the information available on the status of Mobulid rays. PNA members strongly supported the proposal and looked forward to its adoption by WCPFC16."
WCPFC16,511,"French Polynesia stated that it has a territory of 5 million km2, which is a sanctuary for all species of sharks and manta rays. As is true for many other Pacific islands cultures, manta rays have significant cultural importance. French Polynesia expressed its support for the FFA proposal aiming at increasing the consideration and protection of mobulid rays."
WCPFC16,512,"New Caledonia stated that mobulids are protected species in its waters, and stated it shares the concern of FFA members regarding these species. It voiced its full support, and thanked FFA for providing Annex 1, regarding best handling practices. To facilitate training, New Caledonia suggested that SPC could provide training materials for fishermen on best practices."
WCPFC16,513,"The EU, Korea, and Indonesia voiced support for the measure, with China supporting the measure if the CITES reference in the preambular was removed."
WCPFC16,514,"Following further discussions between CCMs, and revisions by Australia, Japan stated that it would not block adoption of the measure, as it was supported by all other CCMs. However, Japan stated its concern regarding the lack of scientific justification for the proposed CMM, and that it believes that this type of CMM should be adopted based on a clear recommendation from the SC. Japan stated that it considers that adoption of the CMM did not prejudice Japan’s future position on any CMM."
WCPFC16,515,"The Commission tasked the Scientific Services Provider with reviewing the data available via the Regional Observer Program and Scientific data to be provided to the Commission and identify any additional data requirements to undertake an assessment, either via traditional stock assessments or on the basis of quantitative risk assessments, ecological risk assessments, indicators assessment or other data-poor analytical techniques. Such information shall be considered by the Scientific Committee to advise the Commission on the feasibility and schedule for an assessment for mobulid rays."
WCPFC16,516,"If the Scientific Committee advises that an assessment is feasible, and resources are made available, the Commission tasks the Scientific Services Provider to present, by 2023, an assessment of the status of mobulids to the Scientific Committee."
WCPFC16,517,"The Commission adopted the Conservation and Management Measure on Mobulid Rays caught in association with fisheries in the WCPFC Convention Area (Conservation and Management Measure 2019-05, Attachment O*)."
WCPFC16,518,"The Commission requests the Scientific Committee to recommend, whenever considered adequate based on evolving knowledge and scientific advice, further improvements to the handling practices detailed in Annex 1 of CMM 2019-05.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  87    8.4.2 The proposal by Korea in DP15 for the protection of cetacean from purse seine fishing operations."
WCPFC16,519,"CCMs discussed the proposal by Korea, first introduced under Agenda Item 4, and revised as WCPFC16-2019-DP15_rev2, Proposed Amendments to Conservation and Management Measure for Protection of Cetaceans from Purse Seine Fishing Operations (CMM 2011-03) - revision 2. CCMs were unable to reach consensus on adoption of the proposal. In particular, concerns were expressed by Japan regarding the lack of a scientific justification for the proposal. The United States proposed specific taskings for SC16 and SPC to progress work on cetacean bycatch while addressing the concerns raised by Japan. WWF, Pew and IOF stated they supported the recommendation by the United States and stated that in their view cetacean bycatch does need to be addressed."
WCPFC16,520,"The Commission tasked the Scientific Committee in 2020 (SC16) to develop and recommend best handling practices for the release of cetaceans, taking into account existing standards or guidelines adopted in other fora, for consideration at WCPFC17."
WCPFC16,521,"The Commission tasked the Scientific Services Provider to review available data to provide estimates of fishery interaction types and levels with cetaceans, without respect to particular flags, to the lowest possible taxonomic level, in the WCPF Convention Area, and to provide a report to the Scientific Committee for its review.  AGENDA ITEM 9 — ADOPTION OF REPORTS FROM SUBSIDIARY BODIES"
WCPFC16,522,"The reports of the subsidiary bodies were taken by the Chair as read and were not presented to the Commission. However, recommendations of subsidiary bodies not addressed under other agenda items were considered under this agenda item. 9.1 SC15"
WCPFC16,523,The Chair referred the Commission to WCPFC16-2019-SC15: SC15 Summary Report.
WCPFC16,524,The Commission noted the recommendations from SC15 set out in WCPFC16-2019-27 and adopted the SC15 Summary Report (WCPFC16-2019-SC15).   9.2 NC15
WCPFC16,525,"The Chair referred the Commission to WCPFC16-2019-NC15: NC14 Summary Report. The NC Chair stated that NC16 would be held in Japan in early September, 2020. In addition, Japan will also host a joint NC and IATTC Working group meeting in late July 2020, with a CDS working group meeting held in conjunction."
WCPFC16,526,"The Joint IATTC-WCPFC NC CDS WG Chair, Mr Shingo Ota, discussed their second meeting, held on 2 September 2019, and reviewed interest in development of an electronic CDS for Pacific bluefin tuna, which most participants favoured. It discussed various options for establishment of an electronic CDS (independently, building on the existing ICCAT CDS, or using the system developed by ICCAT). He suggested that the Commission may want to consider development of an electronic CDS for all tuna species, including tropical species, noting that although the IATTC-WCPFC NC CDS WG is scheduled to finish its work by the end of 2020, it could be advantageous to delay a decision, pursue further investigation, and report back to the Commission.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  88"
WCPFC16,527,"The Compliance Manager stated that the Secretariat’s understanding of the CDS development situation was that the WCPFC CDS Intersessional Working Group Chair had withdrawn over 1 year previously, and that the IWG was waiting for development of draft CDS standards to be developed by the FFA."
WCPFC16,528,"The United States discussed it proposal, in WCPFC16-2019-DP11 Rules of Procedure relating to the Northern Committee, regarding a modification to the rules of procedure for the NC, which it stated reflected a problem faced by the NC in reaching quorum, which had occurred twice. The proposed change to the rule of procedures would enable NC to open and permit debate with a simple majority (rather than 75% of members) present."
WCPFC16,529,"Canada stated that as a member of NC, it found the situation challenging when a quorum was not achieved and encouraged the participation of all members. It supported the proposal by the USA. Chinese Taipei also supported the proposal."
WCPFC16,530,"RMI inquired regarding the effect of the proposed rule change, and what would happen if a fragmented decision came back to the Commission. It inquired if this had been done before in other RFMOs. The United States stated that when quorum was not achieved at what was a regularly scheduled meeting, the NC chair would allow discussion to take place, with a subsequent meeting conducted on the margins of the Commission’s annual meeting, as occurred at WCPFC16. It noted that the Commission only received legitimate decisions from a quorum of the NC. RMI stated that the precedent that would be set was significant, and needed to be considered holistically, and inquired if rules for TCC should be changed to make it possible to hold meetings without a quorum?"
WCPFC16,531,"The EU stated that it understood that the proposal would simplify the NC’s work, but stated that this flexibility should not be used as a precedent and expressed the view that the rules governing the NC within the Commission were not fully satisfying, whereby decisions or recommendations could only be approved or rejected. It stated that it would like to be able to participate as a member of the NC and suggested that the way the NC functions should be modified. While suggesting these issues should be kept in mind, it stated that while the EU would not oppose the proposal, it sought greater transparency."
WCPFC16,532,"FSM, on behalf of FFA members, stated that the same threshold for quorum should apply to all meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies. To allow for a lower threshold for a quorum for NC was not agreeable to FFA members. FFA members suggested that the NC meeting could be held in conjunction with other WCPFC meetings, which would enable SIDS to participate more effectively."
WCPFC16,533,Vanuatu stated its opposition to the proposal.
WCPFC16,534,The Commission noted the subsequent discussions that occurred at WCPFC16 related to North Pacific Swordfish and Pacific Bluefin and adopted the report of NC15 (WCPFC16-2019-NC15).
WCPFC16,535,"The Commission noted that Japan will host the next meeting of the Northern Committee – IATTC Working Group for Pacific Bluefin Tuna in late July 2020, and that this includes a one-day meeting of its Pacific Bluefin CDS Working Group.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  89  9.3 TCC15"
WCPFC16,536,"The Chair stated that the recommendations of TCC were highlighted in WCPFC16-2019-28, and noted the TCC15 Summary Report, WCPFC16-2019-TCC15."
WCPFC16,537,The United States confirmed it would provide a chair for the VMS IWG (proposed by TCC15) to address VMS data gaps and improve reliability of VMS reporting to the Commission.
WCPFC16,538,"FSM on behalf of FFA members supported the TCC15 recommendation that WCPFC16 establish an IWG to develop specific recommendations to address VMS data gaps and improve the number of vessels reporting to the Commission VMS. It stated that VMS Non-Reporting to the Commission VMS has been a long-standing issue and is discussed at length at each TCC, where the persistence of vessels on the WCPFC RFV not reporting to the Commission VMS is noted. It appears that the problem is worsening. They reminded CCMs of Article 24(8) of the Convention, which obliges each CCM to require its fishing vessels to use MTUs that meet agreed WCPFC VMS Standards Specifications and Procedures (SSPs) while operating in areas covered by the Commission VMS within the Convention Area. FFA members supported the USA’s nomination to chair the IWG, and Australia as possible co-chair."
WCPFC16,539,"Cook Islands on behalf of FFA members acknowledged the efforts by the TCC Vice-Chair to revise the workplan during the margins of TCC15 and following TCC15. They stated they were pleased to note that the draft workplan covers key work areas of priority to FFA members, including future work under the CMS, and that it takes into consideration the TCC workload beyond 1 year, but highlighted that implementation of the workplan would require adequate resourcing."
WCPFC16,540,"Kiribati on behalf of FFA members referenced the report from the TCC WG on flow of observer reports and observer conduct (WCPFC15 Summary Report para 364). FFA members supported the TCC15 outcome that agreed for continuation of the TCC WG’s efforts, stated their support for any work to strengthen the flow of observer reports for the purpose of supporting investigation by CCMs, including considerations of tracking observer report requests through the Commission’s Case File Management System as a way to improve transparency on the nature and timing of requests for observer reports from observer providers by flag State CCMs. However, they highlighted that FFA members would not support any amendments to the ROP Minimum Standards for observer reports that: dilute the authority of observer providers; impinge upon the ownership of data and information by coastal States with respect to fishing within EEZs; or discriminate or allow for unfair treatment of observers."
WCPFC16,541,"WWF, IELP, TOF, IPLNF, SFP, and Pew submitted a joint intervention with respect to the TCC Summary Report, and also with regard to all subsidiary bodies of the Commission. They stated that at present, a lack of sufficient data that is typically generated through adequate observer coverage represents the single largest obstacle to establishing appropriate management measures. In fact, uncertainty and a lack of data is continually cited in the WCPFC process as a reason for inaction or delay. It is unquestionable that information collected as part of a successful observer programme is critically important to the proper conservation and management of our tuna fisheries. Data collected by observers plays a central role in informing fisheries scientists and managers on everything ranging from stock assessments to non-target species impacts as demonstrated by New Zealand's seabird proposal discussed earlier and the marine mammal proposal put forward by Korea. Furthermore, observers play an indispensable role in monitoring and documenting compliance with very important CMMs in the WCPO. Therefore, the WCPFC must consider securing full observer coverage in the longline fishery, whether through human observers or electronic monitoring, a top priority. All CCMs agreed to the WCPF Convention text and other Commission obligations to ensure the best scientific information or evidence available is used in WCPFC decisions. This obligation not only requires CCMs to actively seek out and use the best available scientific evidence, but also to ensure that measures generate the best available scientific evidence. WCPFC established CMM 2007-01 which specifies that fisheries observer coverage is to be 5% of effort in each non-purse seine fishery. At that time low observer coverage in the longline fishery was identified as a significant conservation risk, with the arbitrary benchmark established at 5% considered a starting point for a stepwise progression toward full observer coverage. By failing to adopt a higher, scientifically and statistically valid level of observer coverage on longline vessels, the WCPFC has failed to meet the charge of the WCPF Convention to generate WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  90    and use the best available scientific information. Therefore, the WCPFC must take action to improve observer coverage across all longline vessels operating in the WCPFC Convention Area."
WCPFC16,542,The Commission noted the recommendations from TCC15 set out in WCPFC16-2019-28.
WCPFC16,543,"The Commission agreed to establish the VMS-Small Working Group (SWG) to address the VMS data gap and improve the number of vessels reporting to the Commission VMS for consideration by TCC16 (TCC Summary Report, paragraph 211). The Commission agreed that the SWG would be co-chaired by the United States and Australia."
WCPFC16,544,The Commission noted that the update of the TCC Workplan would be progressed electronically during 2020.
WCPFC16,545,The Commission adopted the Summary Report of TCC15 (WCPFC16-2019-TCC15).   9.4 Intercessional Working Groups 9.4.1 Working Group to Review the Transhipment Measure (CMM 2009-06)
WCPFC16,546,The Commission noted the report on the progress by the IWG to Review the Transhipment Measure CMM 2009-06 (TS-IWG) from the Co-Chairs.
WCPFC16,547,"The Commission agreed to the TS-IWG to continue its work in 2020. Following significant progress on its draft Scope of Work for the analysis of transhipment information, the TS-IWG will reconvene electronically in 2020. While the IWG was able to reach agreement on a considerable number of elements in the draft, there remain a few outstanding issues for which the IWG will need to consider and agree upon intersessionally. Moving forward, the TS-IWG Co-Chairs will welcome comments only on the outstanding proposed language in the draft Scope of Work by 13 January 2020. The Co-Chairs will circulate the updated Scope of Work following the conclusion of WCPFC16 and provide further instructions to the IWG by email.   9.4.2 ERandEM WG"
WCPFC16,548,"The ERandEM WG Chair (Australia) stated, that as noted under Agenda Item 4, the ERandEM WG responded to a tasking from TCC to revise the Electronic Monitoring concept paper and present it to WCPFC16. The ERandEM WG met at WCPFC16 as a SWG and had a very useful discussion on objectives and standards. There was interest from the working group in using the ROP objectives for EM work in the future, but an endorsement by the Commission of that objective will be needed at WCPFC16."
WCPFC16,549,"Kiribati sought to clarify the focus of the objective, noting its understanding that the focus for EM is on data gaps, specifically with respect to longline fisheries and transhipment on the high sea."
WCPFC16,550,"The ERandEM WG Chair recalled that the Commission had considered the priority areas a number of times, beginning through a consultancy in 2014. It highlighted the data gaps referenced by Kiribati. More recently Project 93 (involving the FFA, PNAO, SPC and WCPFC secretariats) confirmed the need to address the longline and transhipment data gaps. That focus is captured in both the concept paper, and the implementation schedule.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  91"
WCPFC16,551,"New Caledonia inquired regarding incentives for the use of Electronic Monitoring, and whether there is information available regarding onboard technical equipment and automatic treatment of video. The ERandEM WG Chair noted that incentives for the use of Electronic Monitoring will depend on national priorities in relation to data collection and needs. The Chair stated that there were a number of ways to incentivise the uptake of electronic monitoring systems by industry.  The Chair stated that Australia has implemented Electronic Monitoring across a number of fleets and fishing methods to support data collection and verification, and has seen some strong outcomes including much improved bycatch reporting, but noted that electronic monitoring systems were not the only solution to improving data collection."
WCPFC16,552,"Kiribati reiterated that it was uncomfortable with the proposed language for the objective, stating that the focus should be on the identified data gaps."
WCPFC16,553,"The ERandEM WG Chair noted the following principles that were raised during discussions in the margins of WCPFC16, in relation to progressing the implementation of Electronic Monitoring in the WCPO: ▪ ensuring that the objectives remain broad to accommodate the priorities of CCMs as they develop their use of EM technology; ▪ as noted at TCC15, taking into consideration the outcomes from Project 93 that describe areas where independent verification of data is low; ▪ that EM technology in the WCPO should be used to target data gaps and uncertainties and as noted in Project 93 outcomes and recommended previously by TCC11 (and endorsed by WCPFC12) – the priority areas for implementation are longline and high seas transhipment activity; ▪ that EM systems should be used to complement and supplement other data verification methods, such as observers; and ▪ recognising the constraints and limitations of this technology as identified during trials."
WCPFC16,554,The Commission noted the intersessional progress by the Electronic Reporting and Electronic Monitoring Working Group on the development of draft Minimum Standards for Electronic Monitoring Programmes.
WCPFC16,555,"The Commission endorsed the following objectives for electronic monitoring: “The objectives of the Commission Electronic Monitoring Programme (EMP) shall be to collect verified catch and effort data, other scientific data, and additional information related to the fishery from the Convention Area and to monitor the implementation of the conservation and management measures adopted by the Commission”."
WCPFC16,556,The Commission agreed that the conclusions from Project 93 in relation to data gaps be considered in the implementation of regional electronic monitoring standards.   AGENDA ITEM 10 — COMPLIANCE MONITORING SCHEME  10.1 Consideration and Adoption of the Final Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR)
WCPFC16,557,"The Commission considered the provisional CMR recommended by TCC15 through a small working group led by Laurence Edwards (TCC Chair), which compiled the final CMR for adoption. The TCC Chair provided a report on the SWG outcomes.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  92"
WCPFC16,558,"Vanuatu responded to paragraph 19 of the final CMR by providing additional clarification on North Pacific albacore catch and effort by Vanuatu vessels in 2018, and stated that this information had been incorporated into the NC15 report submitted to WCPFC16 for adoption. Essentially, effort directed at North Pacific albacore has declined by 30%, and North Pacific albacore catch by 37%, since the 2002–2004 reference period. This change was not clear from the data originally submitted to the NC. Vanuatu concurred with the view of Korea that the current text of CMM 2005-03 needs to be clarified."
WCPFC16,559,"The Commission adopted the Final Compliance Monitoring Report for 2019 (WCPFC16-2019-finalCMR, Attachment P*).   10.2 Review the workplan of tasks to enhance the Compliance Monitoring Scheme"
WCPFC16,560,The Commission noted the recommendations from TCC15 and the progress on the workplan of tasks to enhance the Compliance Monitoring Scheme as set out in WCPFC16-2019-30.   10.3 Expiry of CMM 2018-07 at the end of 2019
WCPFC16,561,The TCC Vice-Chair presented the outcomes of the SWG to consider the Expiry of CMM 2018-07.
WCPFC16,562,"The Commission adopted Conservation and Management Measure 2019-06, Attachment Q* which amends the Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMM (CMM 2018-07) and extends the Scheme for a further two years."
WCPFC16,563,"The Commission agreed to establish a Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS) Intersessional Working Group under the leadership of the Vice-Chair of TCC, Dr Robert Day (Canada) which would work virtually to progress work intersessionally to undertake the CMS Future Work, including on audit points and the risk-based framework."
WCPFC16,564,"FSM, on behalf of FFA members, stated they were the original proponents of the CMS CMM because FFA members take their responsibilities under the Convention seriously and recognise the importance of demonstrating accountability and transparency. They stated that implementation and enforcement of obligations, in accordance with our national laws, are essential in ensuring the long-term sustainability of our tuna resources. FFA members welcomed the Commission’s agreement to extend the CMS for two years and recognised the value of having a process in place that provides an appropriate level of scrutiny on CCMs. FFA members indicated their understanding that some CCMs sought a different outcome on certain aspects of the CMS, and appreciated the flexibility that was shown, noting that FFA members had also worked in good faith, and demonstrated flexibility, in achieving the outcome. FFA members highlighted their intention to ensure the focus of the CMS remains on systemic issues, to enable the Commission to continue to enhance its ability to meet the objectives of the Convention. They observed that the aggregated tables would ensure continuing access to relevant information and a structured process for following up on identified systemic issues, and suggested the revised measure would demonstrate that CCMs continue to effectively discharge their responsibilities. FFA members sought to clarify that the tables to be included in the provisional CMR (as per paragraph 37 of the CMM) are a summary of the para 26(ii) report for previous years, by obligation, not identified by CCM. FFA members agreed that it is important to have information on the public record to demonstrate the good progress that the Commission as a whole is making on compliance with its agreed obligations. They stressed their interest in maintaining a positive WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  93    compliance culture in the WCPFC and hoped that the new CMM would enable the Commission to move forward with a more positive spirit. FFA members stated they would continue their efforts to improve the process through efforts to ensure the CMS is robust, effective, efficient and fair, and looked forward to working with other CCMs in this regard."
WCPFC16,565,"The TCC Chair (RMI) acknowledged and thanked Dr Robert Day (CMS WG Chair and Vice Chair of TCC), the Compliance Manager, Secretariat staff and CCMs for producing a CMS CMM for the next two years. He noted that CCMs have endured many deliberations, challenges and debates over the CMS proposal, but welcomed the progress in renewing the CMS with a new process that will be focused on assessment at CCM level, which correlates to the Convention’s relevant Articles and moves away from past practices that have hampered TCC meetings in dealing with alleged infringements (case by case, day by day, night by night). He noted this would help provide assurance to the Secretariat and CCMs that compliance assessment would be effective, efficient, and fair."
WCPFC16,566,"The EU expressed it congratulations to the CCMs that worked on and supported the measure. The EU stated that the impossibility to assess compliance at a vessel level risks to water down the compliance system in WCPFC. However, the EU could join the consensus to support the measure based on the reassurances made by the proponents indicating that assessments could still be taken at TCC when Flag States do not initiate any action following alleged infringements. The EU also stated that it looked forward to testing the new process over the forthcoming 2 years with a view to further improvements and hoped that a frank and open deliberation could be held at TCC16 in support of a good compliance outcome."
WCPFC16,567,"New Zealand expressed appreciation to the chair of the SWG, all CCMs who cooperated, and Cook Islands for its efforts. New Zealand stated that its objective was a robust but streamlined system that focusses on compliance with the obligations which pose the greatest risk to the objectives of the Commission.  and noted its view that a risk-based assessment framework would be critical to the success of the other components of the CMS program. It looked forward to working with other members at TCC to enhance additional parts of the CMS."
WCPFC16,568,"The United States expressed its satisfaction that WCPFC16 could agree on a revised CMS measure. It stated its hope that in the future the CMS measure could be adopted for longer periods, and that the approach would be robust, and would continue to allow WCPFC to have one of the best CMSs. It noted the need to focus on the ambitious TCC workplan, with almost no progress made in 2019. It thanked New Zealand for its work on risk-based assessment, which it hoped could soon be circulated to other members for review and looked forward to beginning work on audit points."
WCPFC16,569,"IELP, The Ocean Foundation, Pew, IPNLF, and WWF commented regarding the CMS process generally and, more specifically, the draft guidelines for participation of observers in closed meetings that consider the compliance monitoring report stating that:  i. They were pleased CCMs reached agreement on a new CMS because compliance is critical to the success of Commission members in achieving their conservation and management objectives, and were pleased that some of the information from the tables to be included in the CMR will be made public, which would assist civil society to help CCMs achieve compliance through technical, financial, and other assistance. They stated that more generally, transparency increases the legitimacy of decision making, and that stakeholders who are invested in, and rely on, the WCPFC fisheries, will be able to better understand how the fishery is being conducted and how decisions are being made.  ii. They remained disappointed that CCMs were unable to reach agreement to allow observers to participate in discussions of the draft CMR, stating they had consistently strived to provide positive contributions to the work of the Commission and individual CCMs, and that excluding observers WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  94    from CMR discussions was at odds with Article 21 of the Convention, as well as the conclusions of the Independent Review Panel, which found that excluding observers from CMR discussions was a major exception to the implementation of Article 21 on transparency. They noted that observers possess information and technical knowledge relevant to the compliance process, and their participation could help improve CMM implementation and lead to more targeted capacity assistance to address compliance-related gaps.  iii. With respect to the draft guidelines on observer participation submitted by the United States, WCPFC16-2019-DP14, the observers noted their willingness to comply with guidelines and sign a confidentiality agreement in order to participate in Commission discussions regarding the CMR, but stated the rules must be clear, fair, and equitable, which DP14 did not achieve. They called attention to WCPFC16-2019-OP13, which they stated more effectively balances the concerns for confidentiality of CMS discussions with clear, fair, and equitable guidelines for observer participation. They looked forward to collaborating with CCMs to progress this work."
WCPFC16,570,On behalf of the Commission the Chair thanked Dr. Robert Day for his work on the CMS CMM.  List of Obligations to be Reviewed by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme in 2020 567. The Vice-Chair presented the outcomes of the SWG to develop the list of obligations to be reviewed by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme in 2020.
WCPFC16,571," The Commission agreed to the List of Obligations to be reviewed by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme in 2020, covering 2019 activities (Attachment R*)."
WCPFC16,572,The Commission noted that this is the third time the list of obligations is being rolled over and tasked the TCC16 to recommend a proposed list of obligations to be assessed in 2021 (covering 2020 activities) for consideration by WCPFC17 in 2020.    AGENDA ITEM 11 — ADOPTION OF THE 2020 IUU VESSEL LIST
WCPFC16,573," The Chair introduced WCPFC16-2019-31: WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2020, which presented for the consideration of WCPFC16 the relevant information for a decision on the 2020 WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC16,574,The Commission agreed to maintain the three vessels currently on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List and adopted the 2020 WCPFC IUU Vessel List (Attachment S*).
WCPFC16,575,The Commission approved the TCC15 recommendations that the Executive Director request information about the vessels on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List and to promptly advise CCMs.
WCPFC16,576,"The Chair advised the meeting that the EU submitted proposal WCPFC16-2019-DP08 Proposal for Amending CMM 2010-06 to provide for cross-listing of IUU vessels among RFMOs and measures concerning the involvement of nationals in IUU fishing. In addition, the Chair also reminded actions to be taken to capture the name and nationality of the master and beneficial owners of IUU vessels; cross listing and the name and nationality of the master and beneficial owners were also addressed through recommendations from TCC15.   WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  95"
WCPFC16,577,"Australia stated its resolute commitment to combatting IUU, both in the Pacific and across the globe, and that its strong partnership with its regional neighbours is demonstrated by ongoing engagement and cooperation, through the FFA, to secure fisheries resources within the Pacific region. It stated that Australia actively collaborates with FFA members and seeks to enhance participation in cooperative activities in the Pacific by sharing resources, exchanging information and maximising the effectiveness of monitoring, control and surveillance tools; Australia also has a proven record of taking action to secure regional fisheries resources, including through their contribution to regional surveillance such as Operation Nasse, as reported on to TCC15. It has long recognised the value of cooperating regionally and extended its sincere thanks to France, New Zealand and the United States for ongoing cooperative activity in the Pacific. Australia stated that it is continuing its long-term investment in the Asia-Pacific region and has committed to a new 30-year programme providing boats and aerial surveillance to help deter illegal fishing. It is also conducting regional maritime surveillance and enforcement capacity building activities, which contribute to the ability of CCMs to ensure the safety and security of their maritime zones. Australia observed that IUU fishing continues to threaten the sustainability of the ocean and the economies that depend on it, it compromises opportunities for legitimate fishers, and undermines the rules-based order designed to ensure cooperation in the management of fish stocks and the disruption of IUU business models. Australia stated it was pleased that the level of illegal fishing in the Pacific remained relatively low, which signals that CCMs’ collective interventions are working, but that careful attention and scrutiny on issue remained the best insurance. Australia urged all CCMs to continue their efforts as coastal, market, and port States and States with nationals engaging in IUU fishing to do everything within their power to combat IUU fishing."
WCPFC16,578,"Japan addressed the proposal that the Secretariat indicate the master’s name and nationality on the IUU vessel, stating its view that procedurally there was a need to amend CMM 2010-06."
WCPFC16,579,"RMI addressed the three vessels that had been on the IUU list for many years, during which time the Commission had been unable to take any effective action, and suggested that until the Commission could reduce the existing IUU vessel list, it should not make the list longer by adding vessels from other RFMOs."
WCPFC16,580,"Tonga stated on behalf of FFA members that, as recommended by TCC15, the master’s name and nationality should be included in the WCPFC IUU List, so that rogue persons involved in IUU fishing could be tracked. They recalled that WCPFC13 agreed that “where the vessel is not listed on the Record of Fishing Vessels and the master’s name and nationality are not known, the flag State is responsible for providing the name and nationality of the master, so that these details can be included into the WCPFC IUU Vessel List”, and request that the Executive Director ensure that master’s name and nationality are captured for any future listings on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC16,581,"Japan stated that it appreciated efforts to revise the IUU CMM. Regarding the comment from RMI, it observed that the frustrations are understandable, and that many RFMOs have a long list of IUU vessels, and that most of the vessels had probably changed their name, flag, etc. Japan stated that one way to address this would be through the use of the IMO number, because that cannot be changed. Most vessels are now required to obtain IMO numbers, and hopefully this could help solve the issue. Japan stated it was not sure if the RFMOs should keep long lists of vessel names on IUU lists, but suggested that for now it was perhaps the best approach, while considering a cut-off, such as deleting vessels after 10 years, as otherwise the list would expand and become less useful."
WCPFC16,582,"The EU stated that all CCMs were engaged in the fight against IUU, and stressed the need to proceed step by step, to reinforce the means contributing to reduce IUU fishing,. It stated that fundamentally the Commission should recognize vessels from other RFMOs, when they have already been identified elsewhere as IUU. The EU stressed the need for a comprehensive approach, as IUU fishing would continue, and could be reduced only through common effort. It noted that the proposal provided more instruments to fight IUU fishing.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  96"
WCPFC16,583,"Fiji, on behalf of FFA members, stated that since TCC14 FFA members had broadened their approach to combating IUU fishing, from a heavily vessel-focused approach to include greater scrutiny and profiling of individuals and companies involved in IUU fishing. That approach was fully endorsed by the fisheries ministers of FFA members and involves the inclusion of information on the beneficial ownership of a vessel in the WCPFC IUU listing process, in particular for any new listings. FFA members proposed that any person with at least 25% equity interest in a vessel, whether directly or indirectly, should be considered a beneficial owner. The flag State of the vessel is primarily responsible for providing information on beneficial ownership. FFA members sought the views of other CCMs."
WCPFC16,584,"RMI suggested that the proposal be re-examined by TCC in order to develop a better option in the interest of achieving an IUU-free Pacific, noting that cross listing had to be examined in relation to the practicality of implementing CMM 2010-06 and its obligations."
WCPFC16,585,"New Caledonia stated that all CCMs were concerned about IUU, especially Pacific coastal states, and termed IUU fishing a poison for WCPFC fishing, one that directly affects resource sustainability and profitability. It supported any action that can help reduce IUU fishing."
WCPFC16,586,"Canada supported cross-listing of IUU vessels, and stated it listened with interest to the FFA statement regarding beneficial owners. The WCPFC added 0 vessels over the prior 10 years, while other RFMOs have added IUU vessels, which are apparently operating in those areas. Canada inquired if those IUU vessels were possibly fishing in the WCPO? It encouraged using the available tools that were not very costly and could help identify vessels as they come into WCPO waters to fish and visit ports. Canada stressed it should be a straightforward issue, which could be but should not have to be deferred."
WCPFC16,587,"The EU stated that not supporting cross-listing was a good way to obstruct the fight on IUU fishing, noting that the issue had been fully discussed and supported at TCC and other RFMOs. The EU rejected the suggestion that CCMs could not implement and take into account a larger IUU vessel list, stating that a longer list would simply enable a CCM to refuse port entry or further inspect vessels on the list, which would not entail a burden, more than the obligations that port States have to fight IUU fishing. The EU acknowledged there would be additional work for the Secretariat, but stated it had worked with the Secretariat in formulating revisions to DP08, and that are presented in DP08_rev1 that aim to facilitate the cross-listing processes. It stated that the arguments being raised were not good ones to justify not to support the proposal."
WCPFC16,588,French Polynesia shared the concerns raised about IUU fishing and supported adoption of the proposals at WCPFC16.
WCPFC16,589,"PNG supported the FFA comments in terms of inclusion of new processes to address IUU through listing of beneficial owners and persons of interest, while supporting the views of RMI that alternatives should be found to simply continuing to list IUU vessels."
WCPFC16,590,"China stated it is a member of both IATTC and IOTC, and both adopted IUU cross-listing in 2018, which created legal issues for China, and stated that it could only agree to cross listing on a case-by-case basis for organisations of which China is a member."
WCPFC16,591,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, stated that they had taken several opportunities to discuss the proposal by the EU regarding cross-listing, but that the EU has not yet responded to the queries that they had raised earlier in the session. They further stated that they supported the principle of IUU vessel cross-listing but needed further time to consider the issue of administrative burden for the Secretariat and national administrations, as well as problems identified in other RFMOs. Australia stated that the FFA also needed time to consider the underlying process to ensure WCPFC’s listing procedures remained robust. It expressed WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  97    concern that the information that led to the original listing by another RFMO would not be readily available to TCC without the agreement of those RFMOs. Australia also stated that the CMM 2013-06 assessment of the EU’s proposal did not meet FFA members’ expectations. and needed further work. It suggested that the critical questions be considered by TCC, along with a revised and improved 2013-06 assessment to accompany any new proposal. It stated it would keep working with the EU to this end."
WCPFC16,592,"Japan stated it recognized the position of FFA members, but encouraged them to consider that other RFMOs might consider that there was a lack of reciprocity and cooperation on the part of WCPFC, given that other RFMOs will incorporate the IUU vessel list from WCPFC, but WCPFC won’t incorporate their lists. Japan suggested that if the Commission receives a list from other RFMOs, it should be posted on the Commission’s webpage and CCMs could think about how to use this."
WCPFC16,593,"Korea thanked the EU for its efforts to combat IUU activities, and stated that it supported the sentiments expressed in the proposal, but had some concerns about the process, especially the delisting process."
WCPFC16,594,"The Chair observed that despite extensive discussion, the Commission could not reach agreement on IUU vessel cross-listing."
WCPFC16,595,"Australia, in closing reiterated its position that the issue should be discussed at TCC. It suggested working through implementation of the proposal with the EU, including to assist in the development of an accurate and comprehensive CMM 2013-06 assessment, with a view to revisiting the cross-listing issue at WCPFC17. RMI supported the comment by Australia but sought a recommendation that TCC focus first on ways to address WCPFC’s IUU vessel list before taking on the IUU vessel lists of other RFMOs."
WCPFC16,596," The EU expressed its disappointment, noting that the cross-listing procedure recommendation was made by TCC, and that the procedure is already used by other RFMOs, and that some CCMs who supported it in those other RFMOs did not support it at WCPFC. The EU proposed that the Commission task the Secretariat to stay in contact with other RFMOs and include on its website the list of other RFMOs’ IUU Vessel lists."
WCPFC16,597,The Commission approved the TCC15 recommendations that the Executive Director ensure that details on name and nationality of master and beneficial owners are captured for any future listings on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC16,598,"The Commission adopted Conservation and Management Measure 2019-07, Attachment T* which amends CMM 2010-06, to include “master of the vessel at the time of the IUU fishing activities, and the nationality(ies) of that master” as a new subparagraph in paragraph 19.    AGENDA ITEM 12 — REPORT OF THE THIRTEENTH ANNUAL SESSION OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE 12.1 Report of the Thirteenth Finance and Administration Committee"
WCPFC16,599,"FAC Co-Chair Camille Movick-Inatio (FSM) reported the key highlights and recommendations from FAC 13 and referenced the comprehensive summary report (WCPFC16-2019-FAC13-11). She thanked all CCMs who participated in FAC13, which met four times. The recommendations from FAC 13 included that the Commission adopt the audited financial statements for 2018 and adopt proposed amendments to the Regulations pertaining to the Special Requirements Fund.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  98"
WCPFC16,600,The Chair thanked the FAC Chair for her leadership.
WCPFC16,601,Japan noted that it had extended the deadline for the Japan Trust Fund to the end of January 2020. Palau thanked Japan for its flexibility.
WCPFC16,602,Australia stated it would accept the FAC’s recommendations and acknowledged the work of the Secretariat and the FAC Chair.
WCPFC16,603,"Kiribati inquired whether, in light of its difficulty in meeting its annual contribution with annual increases, the offset of the annual assessed contributions could be increased. The United States stated its view that given the modest increase in contributions this was possible, although it preferred that this be done in the FAC and recommended to the Commission."
WCPFC16,604,RMI and the EU supported the proposed budget.
WCPFC16,605,"Regarding the tri-annual salary review, Canada noted that the staff rules require it be conducted every 3 years. Canada stated its conclusions were ignored by the FAC; the study cost $20,000, which would have paid for 33% (1 year) of the increase. Canada reminded CCMs that the WCPFC Executive Director receives a cost of living allowance adjustment, but staff do not. 12.2 Budget Approval for 2020 and Indicative Budgets for 2021 and 2022"
WCPFC16,606,"The Commission adopted the report of the Thirteenth Session of the FAC (WCPFC16-2019-FAC13), including the 2020 budget of $ 8,118,261 and indicative budgets for 2021 and 2022 of $8,074,268 and $ 8,087,288 respectively (Attachments U*)."
WCPFC16,607,"The Commission adopted the FAC13 recommendation to amend the Financial Regulations to add a new sub-paragraph 7.8 as follows:  “REGULATION 7 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FUND  7.8: For the purposes of supporting attendance by Chairs of SC, TCC, FAC Co- Chair and the WCPFC Vice Chair from Small Island Developing States to the Annual Session, Financial Regulation 7.5 and 7.7 on the application process and reporting requirements, respectively, shall be waived.”"
WCPFC16,608,"The Commission agreed to offset the annual assessed contributions by an additional USD50,000 from the CNM Fund."
WCPFC16,609,The final adopted 2020 budget and Annexes are provided in (Attachment V*).    AGENDA ITEM 13 — ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS  13.1 Secretariat’s Corporate Plan
WCPFC16,610,"The Executive Director introduced WCPFC16-2019-32: Draft WCPFC Secretariat Corporate Plan. He explained that the Commission agreed in 2015 to a two tier planning framework. Such a framework was developed through a process of broad consultation and a dedicated workshop and reviewed by the Commission in 2016. The Commission in 2017 did not support a long-term strategic plan, and instructions WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  99    were given to develop a mid-term corporate plan. In 2018 the Commission was not able to agree to the draft mid-term corporate plan that was presented. The new instructions from WCPFC15 were to develop a corporate plan, (as presented in WCPFC16-2019-32) to guide the Secretariat’s work. The Executive Director stated he was mindful of the Convention’s mandate for the Secretariat when developing the plan; Article 15(4) of the Convention stipulates the functions of the Secretariat, and he noted that all tasks outlined in the plan are consistent with that mandate. Other guiding principles were that the plan be simple, user-friendly, readily understood, with realistic and achievable targets, and regularly updated (i.e., a living document). Furthermore, it must enable the Secretariat to be strategically organised and managed; adequately resourced; and serve to make the Secretariat more transparent and accountable. The Executive Director reviewed the plan’s organisation and structure, with a mission (to provide efficient and effective secretariat services to enable the WCPFC to fulfil its key mandate), which is supported by goals and underlying objectives. The operational part of the plan comprises activities (with specific actions, and operational plans) and indicators (desired outputs and deliverables), with the latter guiding assessment of the Secretariat’s performance. The plan is intended to be regularly reviewed (updated annually), with the Executive Director annual reporting on the performance of the plan. He noted that the entire Secretariat was consulted in the drafting of the plan."
WCPFC16,611,The EU thanked the Executive Director for the work done and stated that the plan was a useful document. It observed that the plan was more of a reference document rather than one that should be adopted and provided several specific suggestions.
WCPFC16,612,"Cook Islands on behalf of FFA members thanked the Executive Director and the Secretariat for producing the document, which they stated clarifies the role of the Secretariat, and includes important tasking with timelines. FFA members stated they were happy to adopt it, and approved of the Secretariat’s proposal on annual reporting and review of the Corporate Plan. They suggested that this was an appropriate task for the FAC to assess the Plan at their next meeting in 2020 and provide an update to the Commission on the implementation and monitoring of the Plan."
WCPFC16,613,The Chair noted that the plan was a living document and encouraged CCMs to provide feedback to the Secretariat.
WCPFC16,614,The Commission noted the medium-term WCPFC Secretariat Corporate Plan 2020-2023 as a living document to guide the work of the Secretariat and agreed for the Secretariat to proceed to finalise it as an internal planning document (WCPFC16-2019-32).   13.2 Research projects 13.2.1 ABNJ Project
WCPFC16,615,"Janne Fogelgren (FAO) introduced WCPFC16-2019-33, Report to WCPFC on Progress of the Project Sustainable Management of Tuna Fisheries and Biodiversity Conservation in the ABNJ. He noted six years of work had gone into the Common Oceans Tuna Project, and it was time to assess the results of the partnership of over 20 actors including states; RFMOs, and other intergovernmental arrangements; NGOs; private sector and academia working to advance the sustainability of tuna fisheries globally. An ongoing project terminal evaluation found some outcomes were outstanding and contributed significantly to the Project’s goals; many resulted from activities conducted by partners in the Pacific. He cited support work for the development of MSEs, a pilot on EM systems for compliance in Fiji, certification-based courses for compliance officers coordinated by the FFA, the shark and bycatch mitigation work through WCPFC and SPC, and work on biodegradable FADs with ISSF. He invited CCMs to consult the project website for full information on achievements. The successes prompted interest by partners to propose a new set of WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  100    activities for a second phase of the Project that would involve projects on deep-sea fisheries as well as cross-sectoral activities in the high seas. Although it was expected GEF funding would be reduced in Phase II, he stated that the strong partnerships developed during the first phase  involving all the tuna RFMOs, several NGOs, the private sector and other actors  would serve to generate funding from additional donors. FAO received close to 60 proposals for Phase II activities from various partners and was working to prioritize these. Themes include (i) follow-up activities from Phase I, to reinforce their impact, such as MSE, various compliance support activities, capacity building on various subjects (governance and compliance), continuation on the mitigation of bycatch issues; plus (ii) new areas of potential interest such as innovative financing mechanisms related to sustainable/blue economy activities, data limited assessments, and climate change. An initial proposal for the Program, including a concept note for the Tuna Project, will be presented to the partners at the last Program and Project Steering Committees at the end of January 2020. The Program proposal is expected to then be finalized and submitted for consideration by the GEF Council by June 2020. If endorsed, FAO and the partners will work together to develop a fully-fledged project document within 12 months. He invited the Pacific partners to continue to explore jointly better ways to ensure sustainable management of tuna fisheries, maximizing the benefits for the participating communities."
WCPFC16,616,"Nauru, on behalf of FFA members thanked the ABNJ Tuna Project for significantly increasing WCPFC’s understanding of the bycatch components of WCPO tuna fisheries. The project has also provided significant support to some FFA members to advance trials on EM that have been instrumental in making progress on EM in the region. FFA members supported the development of proposals for a second phase of the ABNJ Tuna Project and sought clarification on the timing of the process as its membership seeks to be more involved with the development of these proposals. ABNJ stated that by the final Project Steering Committee meeting in January 2020, a draft concept note would be submitted to the GEF council; assuming approved then the project document would be developed over 12–25 months, with the second phase beginning in early 2022."
WCPFC16,617,The EU affirmed its appreciation for the contributions of the first ABNJ project and supported further collaboration between the Secretariat and Phase II of the ABNJ.
WCPFC16,618,"Tonga thanked the ABNJ Project for increasing its understanding of bycatch, including of sharks; it noted that there were complaints from fishermen of the impact of sharks on fisheries, because of the economic losses, and inquired whether the Commission could examine this, including determining and monitoring the species of sharks, and better understanding the ecology of sharks and their interaction with tuna. The intervention was supported by Niue, which stated it faces the same issues."
WCPFC16,619,The Chair thanked FAO for their contribution through the ABNJ project.
WCPFC16,620,The Commission noted the updates on Progress of the Project on Sustainable Management of Tuna Fisheries and Biodiversity Conservation in areas beyond national jurisdictions and the fact that the project is ending at the end of 2019 (WCPFC16-2019-33). The Commission was also informed on arrangements for a potential second phase to the project.  13.2.2 Pacific Tuna Tagging Project
WCPFC16,621,"Dr Graham Pilling (SPC) introduced WCPFC16-2019-34: Pacific Tuna Tagging Project steering committee, which reports on the Pacific Tuna Tagging Project (PTTP) steering committee meeting held on the margins of SC15 in Pohnpei, FSM in August 2019. PTTP is a joint research project aimed at obtaining data to contribute to and reduce uncertainty in stock assessments of skipjack, bigeye and yellowfin tuna, and improve understanding of interactions between stocks and gears to inform management options. Dr Pilling thanked all CCMs and partners that have contributed to the programme, which currently include PNG, the WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  101    Republic of Korea, Australia, the EU, New Zealand, the WCPFC and ISSF, as well as long-standing partners throughout the region that facilitate and support the work and access to EEZs and fishing grounds. The meeting at SC15 focussed on the 13th central Pacific cruise, which took place in 2018, lasted for 39 days, and focussed on data collection for studies on tuna movements, exploitation rates and FAD association dynamics. During the cruise, almost 1,150 tags were deployed, ranging from conventional to archival and sonic tags. SC15 noted the need for continued CCM participation and support in tag reporting, and the work to reinstate tag recovery officers in key locations and tagging cruise awareness raising efforts. Activities ‘marking’ otoliths in fish through strontium chloride injection, with the aim of improving understanding of tuna growth through validation of ageing estimates, was noted and encouraged. This work relies on the support of CCMs to collect samples and measurements from the recaptured fish. SC15 supported the 2020 tagging programme and budget, along with the 2021–2022 programmes and indicative budgets, and the PTTP workplan in general."
WCPFC16,622,"Vanuatu, on behalf of FFA members noted the report of ongoing progress and success in implementation of the PTTP, and the importance of effective tag seeding to estimating reporting rates and supported increased deployment and fleet coverage of tag seeding experiments. FFA members encouraged continued member participation and support in tag reporting."
WCPFC16,623,"Korea acknowledged the successful accomplishments of the PTTP thus far, including data on specific movements and behavioural issues, and stated that Korea would continue to provide financial support."
WCPFC16,624, The Commission noted the updates on the Pacific Tuna Tagging Project (WCPFC16-2019-34).  13.2.3 WCPFC Tissue Bank
WCPFC16,625,"Dr Graham Pilling (SPC) introduced WCPFC15-2018-35: Report of the Tuna Tissue Bank steering committee, which reports on the steering committee meeting held on the margins of SC15 in Pohnpei, FSM in August. WCPFC established its tissue bank so that national and international fisheries research institutes could access the collections to undertake necessary research to enhance understanding of the dynamics of tuna and related species in the WCPFC region and also of ecosystem dynamics. As an example it has proved pivotal in the recent work on tuna growth that has had significant positive impacts on the stock assessments. SC15 noted the biological samples collected over the past year, with almost 2,700 samples collected from 600 fish, including the key tuna species, billfish and ‘bycatch’ species. However, declines in the rate of sample collection were noted and plans have been developed to reinvigorate sampling in the coming years, such as reward programmes. SC15 tasked the SC to develop initiatives to improve the situation. Other issues noted include the need to improve sample collection and storage processes to maximise the potential for these samples to be used in future genetic analyses, a key area of work planned for the coming years. SC15 endorsed the work plan for the coming year as detailed in WCPFC15-2018-35, and associated budgets, both 2020 and indicative for 2021–2022, as reflected in the SC budget request."
WCPFC16,626,"Solomon Islands, on behalf of FFA members, supported the continuation of the Tuna Tissue Bank program, and emphasised the importance of the project, which provides valuable data in a number of different areas for the work of the Commission."
WCPFC16,627,"The EU stated it was delighted to see that the project, initiated by a voluntary contribution from the EU, had become a key component of the Commission’s scientific work, and supported its continuation."
WCPFC16,628,"Indonesia acknowledged the important work being done and inquired about future close kin analysis; maintenance of the tissue bank and what that entailed; and work done to collect tissue from other WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  102    areas. SPC stated that close kin analysis is used in PBFT for estimating stock size, and that a project (workshop) is proposed to do this. SPC is also considering whether close kin may be most appropriate with respect to management measures for sharks. SPC stated the tissue bank would be involved, but it was first important to determine the value of the research for these applications. The tissue bank has two locations Noumea and Brisbane (through CSIRO). A website provides information on available samples. Samples are obtained from SPC’s own sampling, the wider WCPFC tissue bank, and other programs as well."
WCPFC16,629,The Commission noted the updates on Project 35b: WCPFC Tuna Tissue Bank (WCPFC16-2019-35).  13.2.4 WPEA Project
WCPFC16,630,"Dr SungKwon Soh (WCPFC Science Manager) introduced WCPFC16-2019-36: Update on WPEA Project. The third phase of the Western Pacific East Asia (WPEA) project (the Western Pacific East Asia Improved Tuna Monitoring Activity) funded by New Zealand for 5 years, is now being implemented, and scheduled for completion in 2022. WPEA has a new project manager (Alice McDonald). Key features of the WPEA-ITM Project include: expansion of the capacity of enumerators in collecting catch data from port sampling; building the capacity and sustainability of fisheries observer programs; supporting national policy and legal review to improve tuna fisheries monitoring and governance; and improving the capacity of national fishery staff in data management and analysis. The three countries (Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam) continued to collect tuna catch data at tuna landing sites throughout 2019, which is the core part of the WPEA project. A number of workshops (Annual Data Review, Annual Total Tuna Catch Estimates, and Observer Training) were convened in 2019, and assisted by Peter Williams (SPC-OFP), produced national annual total tuna catch estimates by species and by gear. In 2018, the annual total tuna catch by species in the three countries was around 868,000 mt, which is about 32% of the WCPFC Convention Area catch of 2,716,396 mt in 2018."
WCPFC16,631,New Zealand welcomed the new WPEA project manager and thanked the three countries for their engagement.
WCPFC16,632,"PNG, on behalf of FFA members, noted the progress of this project and its critical importance for addressing data gaps and improving information on tuna catch and fishing effort in Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam. They encouraged the countries to engage actively in the project and expressed gratitude to New Zealand for funding the continuation of the project. They asked how this project would be continued after the current end date to ensure the data continues to be collected and provided for the use of the Commission."
WCPFC16,633,"The Science Manager stated that the project first began in 2005 in the Philippines, and 2007 in Indonesia. Two phases (7 years) were funded by GEF, during which time the Philippines fully took over the responsibility of supporting its enumerators and data collection. Indonesia plans to take over data collection aspects in the near future. Vietnam’s research institute is working to allocate funding to support data collection. He noted that the project has several years to go, and the countries are increasing their responsibilities."
WCPFC16,634,"Indonesia acknowledged the support from New Zealand for the WPEA – ITM Project, stating that increasing its capacity (for data collection and management of tuna fisheries) was a lengthy process. It stated that a significant output was the ability to conduct data collection for stock assessment and harvest strategy. Indonesia is in the process of developing a harvest strategy for tuna in its archipelagic waters and repeated its expectation that this work would be linked with the harvest strategy work in the WCPFC. It stated that the work involved the government and related stakeholders through data collection and appropriate fisheries WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  103    management activities. Indonesia also acknowledged support from Australia through ACIAR in collection of biological data in its archipelagic waters relating to stocks in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It stated that there were many challenges, as Indonesia has one of the most complex tuna fisheries in the world, with most of the catch from small scale fisheries managed by both central and local governments. Currently 60%–70% of the data collection budget is covered by the various stakeholders in Indonesia; further reports on progress will be delivered to SC16, TCC16 and WCPFC17."
WCPFC16,635,"The Philippines acknowledged the assistance provided by the Commission under the project, especially for data collection and looked forward to continuing the work under the project. It noted that the Philippines provides 100% financial support for its data collection."
WCPFC16,636,The Commission noted the updates on the WPEA Project (WCPFC16-2019-36).     13.2.A Others       13.2.A.1  Japan’s proposal to compare high seas VMS data with AIS data
WCPFC16,637,Japan’s proposal (in WCPFC16-2019-DP17) was introduced under Agenda Item 4.
WCPFC16,638,"CCMs generally supported the proposed project. However, several CCMs expressed concerns regarding the use of VMS data differentiated by flag. The EU noted that it has only 2 vessels in the Convention Area and was concerned these could be identified. China stated that its regulations and associated legal issues would preclude the use of China’s VMS data for the project. Chinese Taipei requested that advice on the project be obtained from Scientific Committee.  It also stated its understanding that VMS data was treated as non-public domain data, and was only for the use of the Commission, and requested its data not be used even if the project had acquired scientific advice and some CCMs agreed to provide their VMS data. The United States raised the need for consistency in terms of what data is provided by various CCMs."
WCPFC16,639,"Despite general support for the proposal, Japan withdrew its proposal with the aim to conduct further consultations and presenting the proposal for consideration by the Scientific Committee before re-tabling it to the Commission.     13.2.A.2  MOU with SPRFMO (WCPFC16-2019-37)"
WCPFC16,640,"The Commission’s Legal Adviser addressed the draft MOU between WCPFC and SPRFMO, noting that Article 22 of the Convention provides for suitable arrangements to be made with eligible government organisations. WCPFC has MOUs with other RFMOs. SPRFMO covers same geographic area as WCPFC, and the two Secretariats have discussed a draft MOU between them. A draft was circulated for comments, and revisions are reflected in WCPFC16-2019-37. She noted the MOU is not binding; it was suggested to be in operation for 3 years, with a provision for extension. If approved, the MOU would be forwarded to SPRFMO for their consideration at their meeting in January 2020. If need be it would be returned with their comments and again circulated to CCMs for their advice."
WCPFC16,641,"FSM on behalf of FFA members stated they were generally quite supportive of the MOU, but had some concerns about the scope of the information and data sharing provisions. The protection of confidential information and data that is provided to the Commission is critical. They sought clarity on whether such information and data would be shared under the MOU and emphasised the need for effective confidentiality WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  104    and non-disclosure provisions. The Legal Adviser stated that any data sharing would need to be consistent with the WCPFC Data sharing requirements. The Secretariat would ensure that all requirements were met, and consultations would be held with CCMs if needed. She stated that the Secretariat did not anticipate that significant data sharing would take place, but some (such as regarding IUU fishing and the ROFV) could be anticipated."
WCPFC16,642,The EU supported the process and noted that the text was very comprehensive. It inquired whether the draft had also been discussed by SPRFMO. The Legal Adviser stated that an earlier draft had been discussed by SPRFMO; the document in WCPFC16-2019-37 reflects those consultations.
WCPFC16,643,"Japan stated it was not a member of SPRFMO and voiced the need to be cautious about data exchanges, which it stated should be subject to data rules. It also inquired regarding the degree of data confidentiality in SPRFMO and suggested that if SPRFMO’s data confidentiality rules were weaker than those of WCPFC, and WCPFC provided non-public domain data, it could be at risk of leaking to the public. The Legal Adviser stated that if the Commission requested that the Secretariat ensure reciprocity in sharing non-public data, this would have to be taken into account; additionally, there could be an undertaking that if data was shared the WCPFC rules would apply to that data, meaning confidential data would remain confidential. She stated that those issues could be handled through a decision by the Commission."
WCPFC16,644,"Japan noted that in the case of WCPFC’s MOU with IATTC, there is a separate MOU on exchange and release of data and inquired regarding the differences between the two approaches. The Legal Adviser Stated that in the IATTC the exchange of data is in respect of highly migratory species, meaning there is much more data exchanged. SPRFMO does not cover highly migratory species, thus it is expected that much less data would be exchanged. The focus is more on what vessels are fishing in the area than on what they are catching."
WCPFC16,645,"Japan inquired regarding the exchange of information about IUU vessels. The Legal Adviser stated that under the terms of the draft MOU, the IUU lists would be shared, but noted that simple sharing of the IUU vessel list did not implicate any cross listing."
WCPFC16,646,The Commission endorsed amendments to the draft text of an MOU between SPRFMO and WCPFC to be referred to SPRFMO for the consideration of the SPRFMO Commission. (Attachment X*)     13.2.A.3  Climate Change (WCPFC16-2019-DP04 and DP04_SUPP)
WCPFC16,647,"CCMs held an extensive discussion regarding the resolution. In the course of that discussion several CCMs noted the difficulty they faced in receiving approval from their national authorities for some of the resolution language being proposed. Several other CCMs spoke regarding their obligations under various international agreements to take strong action regarding climate change in all sectors, including fisheries. The issue was further discussed through a SWG on climate change."
WCPFC16,648,"FSM, which served as the chair of the SWG on climate change, presented the outcomes of the SWG as presented in WCPFC16-2019-DP04_SUPP_rev3 11 December 2019."
WCPFC16,649,"New Caledonia stated that all CCMs are impacted by climate change, with some suffering direct impacts during the course of the meeting (e.g., extensive fires in Australia and New Caledonia). It supported the resolution, noting it is a first step.  WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  105"
WCPFC16,650,"Fiji stated that it takes the issue of climate change very seriously, which it stated was already affecting many communities. It described the impacts on coastal fishermen, businesses and food security. At the national level, implementation is underway in Fiji, which committed to 100% sustainable management of Fiji’s EEZ by 2030 with at least 30% marine protected areas. To implement the Paris Agreement Fiji is creating a new law (the Climate Change Act), which will place climate action and ambition at the centre of all of Fiji’s obligations. Climate change impact is a cross-cutting issue, and Fiji is also working regionally on ocean issues; at the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders meeting in Tuvalu in August 2019, Forum Leaders agreed to the Kainaki II Declaration, which it considered the work programme on oceans within the UNFCCC process. Fiji stated that although climate change may not be a priority agenda for the Commission, most if not all of the members are also parties to the UNFCCC, where national governments are actively engaged in the issue across all sectors. It stated that climate change threatens over 60% of WCPFC members on a daily basis, and should command some attention in the dialogue, decisions and actions of the Commission. Fiji urged CCMs to align their efforts on fisheries management and the work of the Commission with this critical issue; supported the FFA proposal; and requested that the Commission task SPC and SC to focus their work programme and research, among others, on the management of tuna stocks due to the impacts brought about by climate change."
WCPFC16,651," The EU supported the resolution, noting that climate change is a very important priority that extends across almost all sectors in the European Community. The EU referenced the importance of considering climate change impacts on fishing activities, as well as impacts of the related industry (e.g., harvesting and processing activities)."
WCPFC16,652,"French Polynesia stated that it was important for the Commission to demonstrate to the world that it is tackling the issue, noting that the Commission’s many island members are the most vulnerable globally to the impacts of climate change. French Polynesia stressed that this was a first step that establishes a framework for further work and supported the resolution."
WCPFC16,653,"Niue supported the resolution, stating that this is priority, and noting the impacts on Tuvalu and others small states. Niue noted that it had hosted a side event at COP 25 (held in Madrid concurrently with WCPFC16) showing what SIDS are doing, and stated that taking action would show that the WCPFC is not working in isolation, but taking into account issues that affect everyone."
WCPFC16,654,France agreed that the issue is urgent and supported the resolution.
WCPFC16,655,"Samoa noted that the resolution reflected instructions from Pacific leaders and stated that given the location of the WCPFC Convention area, it was a duty to pass the resolution."
WCPFC16,656,"Canada noted the importance of climate change, and in particular the impacts being experienced in the region. It also stated that for Canada climate change was also a profound concern in the arctic. Canada appreciated the flexibility CCMs showed in reaching agreement."
WCPFC16,657,"Tuvalu thanked FFA members for the work done, supported the resolution, and urged all members to agree."
WCPFC16,658,The Philippines stated it fully supported the objective of the resolution.
WCPFC16,659,"WWF, on behalf of WWF, IELP, SFP, IPNLF, Pew, CI, and The Ocean Foundation, expressed their agreement with the FFA and congratulated the WCPFC on reaching agreement on a resolution on climate change. They stated that the issue that affects all members with interests in WCPFC fisheries, and in particular WCPFC16 heard the very clear message from FFA member states, which are among the first to directly experience the reality of climate change. Across the Pacific Islands, many are facing unprecedented WCPFC16 Summary Report issued 2 April 2020  106    challenges such as those described by Fiji, which also include flooding, saltwater intrusion into groundwater, and shoreline erosion. These directly impact the business of fisheries and, in turn, the Commission. Additionally, WCPFC16 received the best available scientific information from the science service provider, with projections for all stocks that do not bode well for the future. WWF reflected that during WCPFC16, the United States government authorities had closed the multi-million dollar Pacific cod fishery in the Gulf of Alaska for the first time in history, and that there was a sequential, and possibly related, collapse of the area’s lucrative crab fisheries. WWF stated that the idea that fisheries and climate change exist in isolation is false. WWF stated that this was a cautionary tale, which WCPFC must heed by taking steps to ensure climate change is considered in management actions. Management must be focused to ensure long-term sustainability, and therefore must consider stock resilience in relation to climate change, and engage in a precautionary approach to exploitation in all contexts. Failing this WCPFC could very well be in a similar situation as the Pacific cod fishery in 10 years, wondering where the fish have gone and wishing action had been taken sooner. Therefore, in view of the urgency of this issue and recognizing the Pacific Islands are most impacted by climate change, WWF again congratulated the WCPFC regarding the resolution on climate change with a view to establishing a formal CMM in the near future."
WCPFC16,660,"The Commission adopted the Resolution on Climate Change as it Relates to the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission. (Resolution 2019-01, Attachment X*).    13.2.A.4   Expiry of Charter Notification CMM (WCPFC16-2019-DP01 and DP13"
WCPFC16,661,"The Commission agreed to extend the Charter Notification CMM (CMM 2016-05) for a further two years. (Conservation and Management Measure 2019-08, Attachment Y*)."
WCPFC16,662,"The Commission encouraged Chartering CCMs to report on their application of the chartering measure, to EEZs, high seas, or both EEZ and high seas."
WCPFC16,663,"The Commission agreed that the Scientific Committee, the Technical and Compliance Committee, and the Commission will continue to consider improvements to the charter notification requirements and/or the treatment of chartered vessels under the Commission’s conservation and management measures more generally.  13.3 Election of Officers"
WCPFC16,664,"The Commission made a number of appointments to Commission positions commencing in 2020: a) Ms. Camille Movick-Inatio (FSM) and Mr. Michael Brakke (USA) were appointed as FAC Co-Chairs; and b) Mr. Ueta Faasili Jr (Samoa) was appointed as SC Chair, and Dr. Tuikolongahau Halafihi (Tonga) as SC Vice-Chair."

WCPFC17,18,resilience of the Commission members and stakeholders and their desire to ensure that the work of the  Commission should continue to progress and not be halted or regressed simply because members were not  able to meet physically as they usually do The outcomes of the 16th regular meetings of the Scientific  Committee SC16 Northern Committee NC16 and Technical and Compliance Committee TCC16 and  working groups that were all held virtually provided the requisite technical and scientific advice information  and opinions needed to inform the deliberations and key decisions of the Commission at WCPFC17 The  Executive Director stated that it is very gratifying and uplifting to witness and be part of the collective efforts  of members and stakeholders working diligently and industriously to furnish the Commission with the  necessary advice and information to enable it to continue its work He expressed thanks to the Chair for her  guidance and leadership to the Secretariat CCMs for their resilience and patience in their dealing with the  Secretariat and the chairs and vice chairs and officers of the subsidiary bodies and working groups for their  commitment support and cooperation He also acknowledged the work of SPC FFA and ISC and other  services providers and publicly thanked and commended the Secretariat staff for their commitment and  dedication He closed with wishing the Commission well in its deliberations The Executive Directors  remarks are included as Attachment C

WCPFC17,21,12 Statements from Members and Participating Territories  The Chair mindful of the time constraints encouraged CCMs to avoid presenting lengthy  statements but to provide copies of statements to the Secretariat for distribution
WCPFC17,22,American Samoa stated that it is a United States territory and depends on the USA for its diplomatic  relationships As permitted by Article 43 of the WCPFC Convention the USA has authorized American  Samoa to participate in the WCPFC In that capacity and as provided in Article 30 of the Convention  American Samoa is entitled to all the rights and privileges of other SIDS and territories that participate in  the Commission American Samoa stated that its participation is critically important to it for reasons that it  has often explained namely that its economy is dependent on tuna It asserted that the rules that apply to  other SIDS in recognition of their dependence on their fisheries and the vulnerability of their small island  economies have not been afforded to American Samoa American Samoa stated that it does not have a  registry for the tuna boats based in the territory which fly the USA flag and are subject to the USAs  regulations and their compliance with the Commission is measured according to their flag not where they  are based These boats are therefore subject to stricter regulations and enforcement actions than other fishing  fleets The result is increased cost and lost fishing time American Samoa stated that USAflagged purse  seiners are rendered uncompetitive with other fleets because of higher operating and compliance costs and  reduced fishing opportunities this is especially true in comparison with SIDS fleets which have exemptions  from FAD closures and fish without limits on the high seas America Samoa stated that the USAflagged  purse seiner fleet is in decline with vessels changing flag to escape the high cost of compliance and to  increase their fishing opportunities In 2014 there were 40 USAflagged purse seiners operating in the  Convention area which declined to 31 in 2019 24 in 2020 and as few as 18 in 2021 American Samoa  stated that this is alarming because it cannot simply switch the source of supply from USAflagged boats to
WCPFC17,25,nonUSAflagged purse seiners In 2019 95 of the purse seiners calling to American Samoa were USA flagged vessels nonUSA flag purse seiners are unwilling to call to American Samoa out of fear of being  inspected and fined by government agencies such as the United States Coast Guard and the Environmental  Protection Agency American Samoa stated that the future of its economy is unnecessarily at risk unless  something is done and asked for  the Commissions understanding and support to reverse this devastating  trend It suggested two actions to help remedy this disaster One is to clarify that fishing effort by purse  seiners in the high seas and in domestic zones can be managed together especially in the case of combining  the domestic EEZ days with the high seas days as this will help make their boats more operationally  efficient The other is to recognize the USAflagged purse seiners based in American Samoa as documented  by the American Samoa Board of Marine Inspectors is indeed a SIDS fleet entitled to the same rules as  other SIDS fleets when it comes to the application of CMMs as provided in Article 30 This would help  remove an incentive for vessels to change their flag and leave American Samoa
WCPFC17,26,The Philippines stated that it supports the consensus among CCMs to roll over CMM 201801 to  the year 2021 and to fully engage during the intersessional discussions to progress work so that stocks of  bigeye yellow fin and skipjack tuna are maintained at sustainable levels The Philippines recommended  amending Attachment 2 of CMM 201801 by removing the  adjective traditional  freshchilled  preceding  the word fishing vessels  in Section 1 with the objective of significantly reducing postharvest losses  improving quality and increasing the market value of the Philippine tuna catches from High Seas Pocket  No 1 noting this is also in accordance with thePhilippines  Republic Act No 10611 An Act to Strengthen  the Food Safety Regulatory System in the Country The proposed deletion seeks to conform with the  Philippines  regulation requiring the use of refrigerated vessels to ensure food safety and minimize waste  from fish spoilage The use of refrigerated vessels will further enable the Philippines to comply with its  treaty obligation under the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement UNFSA on the prevention of fish waste  The Philippines further supported progressing the discussions on purse seine effort limits in the high seas  during the review of CMM 201801 on labour standards for crews in fishing vessels and stands committed  to sustaining efforts and initiatives to further improve its level of compliance with its obligations under the  Convention The Philippines congratulated the Commission for successfully convening all meetings and  discussions in 2020 through innovative approaches and flexibility in responding to the challenges of the  COVID19 pandemic
WCPFC17,27,PNG congratulated the WCPFC Executive Director and his staff for their efforts in facilitating the  arrangements for WCPFC17 during these unprecedented and difficult times noting that despite the COVID19  pandemic members must continue to work to address the critical issues at hand and expressing  confidence that the Commission could achieve successful outcomes during WCPFC17 PNG also thanked  CCMs for respecting and upholding the spirit of the Convention through solid consensus on critical issues  PNG stated it sincerely appreciated the active dialogue with developed CCMs in recognizing the special and  unique circumstances of SIDS stating that this is essential to achieving mutually beneficial outcomes PNG  also stated that SIDS as leaders of their respective countries representatives of the people of the Blue  Pacific and custodians of the Pacific Ocean collectively envisioned a healthy productive resilient safe  and thriving ocean while recognizing this cannot be achieved alone PNG stated that meetings such as  WCPFC17 establish a platform for effectively managing the regions fisheries and marine resources while  supporting CCMs in deriving optimal value from the fishery within sustainable limits Nationally PNG has  refocused its attention to developing its natural resources closely guided by its domestic development and  strategic plans Various advancements have been made to strengthen revenue generation and add greater  value to PNGs fisheries industrialization aspirations PNG noted the need for SIDS to gain real and lasting  benefits to enable them to address various levels ofdisproportionate burdenin fisheries  development  and  management and appealed to other members to respect these developments and work in close partnership  with SIDS to advance them for greater mutual benefit PNG further drew the attention of delegates to the  following points
WCPFC17,30,i Obligations under the UNFSA which enables membership to interested parties wishing to  participate in fishing activities in the Convention Area are already being met under WCPFCs CNM  status PNG stated that the issue it has with granting full membership is that it diminishes the  influence SIDS have over their resources  ii Reaching consensus at multilateral negotiations is difficult and PNG commended all CCMs for the  tough decisions that were made by each CCM on the tropical tuna measure despite their respective  views PNGexpressed confidence in the Commissions  ability to uphold the integrity of the CMMs  agreed to during WCPFC17 PNG stated it recognizes the importance of the tropical tuna measure  and the role it plays in the livelihoods of their people and stated that discussing the issue virtually  was not the most practicable and effective means of discussing such as critical issue based on shared  past experience PNG stated that the only way to effectively discuss the CMM is facetoface and  that a rollover of CMM 201801 would be appropriate  iii PNG reaffirmed its position on issues relating to its archipelagic waters and the use of zonebased  management that has contributed to national economic development for its people PNG  additionally affirmed its sovereign right to develop its domestic fisheries a position echoed by all  SIDS to address their development aspirations and stated that the proposals presented by FFA  members are closely aligned to those principles endorsed by their leaders and given in the spirit of  the Convention  PNG stated its awareness that no country or entity can do what is required alone and stated that the difficult  discussions that sometimes take place have one goal to protect and preserve the regions ocean and marine  resources PNG called on CCMs to work together and demonstrate to the world that the WCPFC is second  to none

WCPFC17,57,The Commission discussed the process by which CNM applications would be reviewed The Chair  noted that normal practice was to discuss the CNM applications during plenary and then task the SWG to  consider any outstanding issues and the issue of participatory rights Because of  WCPFC17s  format  and  time constraints the SWG would consider both the applications and the participatory rights and present  recommendations to plenary for decisions
WCPFC17,58,The USA advocated that the Commission not accept the application by the DPRK which would  make consideration of  the DPRKs CNM application by the SWG unnecessary It noted that TCC16 had  made a very clear recommendation to the Commission to deny CNM status to DPRK The comments from  the USA were supported by Australia EU New Zealand and France
WCPFC17,59,The Commission agreed that it would not accept DPRKs  application
WCPFC17,60,The Bahamas stated that it had provided the additional information requested by TCC16 to the  Secretariat and would provide any additional information to the Commission that might be needed It  confirmed its interest to be included in the CNM SWG to facilitate provision of information
WCPFC17,61,Ecuador thanked the Commission for its invitation to WCPFC17 It stated it had complied with all  requirements and invited CCMs to consider its application for CNM status and also for full membership It  also confirmed its interest to participate in the CNM SWG
WCPFC17,62,The Commission forwarded the applications for CNM status in 2021 submitted by the Bahamas  Curaao Ecuador El Salvador Liberia Nicaragua Panama Thailand and Vietnam Ecuador El Salvador  Liberia Thailand and Vietnam to the SWG for further review
WCPFC17,63,Following further deliberations the CNM SWG Chair confirmed that all information requested by  TCC had been submitted to the Secretariat
WCPFC17,64,The EU raised a concern based on very recent information regarding the possible inclusion on the  North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission NEAFC Illegal Unreported and Unregulated IUU Vessel List  of a vessel from Panama The EU stated that it had been unable to raise the issue with Panama and suggested  that the Commission request clarification
WCPFC17,65,China suggested the information was not relevant as it pertained to activities in the current year and  the Commission was reviewing information relating to fishing activities in 2019 China stated the hope that  Panamas application could be approved in conjunction with those of  other  applicants
WCPFC17,66,The EU noted that CMM 201901 on CNMs states that the Commission shall consider certain
WCPFC17,67,criteria outlined in paragraph 3 of the CMM these include its record of responding to any IUU activities by  vessels flying its flag and its record of compliance with CMMs of other RFMOs The EU stated that it was  therefore fully relevant to consider a possible IUU listing by NEAFC
WCPFC17,70,Panama stated that it was discussing the issue with NEAFC that the case was ongoing and that it  would seek to provide more information to the Commission The EU stated it appreciated the response from  Panama and suggested Panama could provide further information to the CNM SWG Chair
WCPFC17,71,The Commission approved the CNM applications from the Bahamas Curaao Ecuador El  Salvador Liberia Nicaragua Thailand and Vietnam It also tasked the CNM SWG to consider the specific  participatory rights to be granted those CNMs The Commission further tasked the CNM SWG to  additionally consider the CNM application of Panama
WCPFC17,72,Following further consultations the EU provided additional details on the FV Boyang Capella  which it stated was flagged to Panama and appeared to be registered on the WCPFC RFV with an active  authorisation The EU stated that the Boyang Capella was apparently listed on the NEAFC provisional IUU  list in early November of 2020 and that as a result of this listing Panama did not obtain CNM status for  2021 in NEAFC The EU stated it appreciated the efforts of Panama for providing at short notice additional  information on the Boyang Capella issue while expressing regret that the information was not proactively  brought to the attention of WCPFC by Panama ahead of WCPFC17 The EU stated that it appeared that  Panamas failure to provide adequate information to NEAFC on the Boyang Capella issue before the 2020  meeting of the NEAFC Permanent Committee on Monitoring and Compliance resulted in i the listing of  the vessel on NEAFCs provisional IUU list and ii in  Panamas  application for  Cooperating  Non Contracting Party status not being supported by NEAFC Members The EU stated that to its knowledge to  date no additional information had been submitted by Panama to NEAFC
WCPFC17,73,Panama informed the WCPFC CNM SWG that a Sanction Administrative Process had been opened  against the Boyang Capella The EU urged Panama to urgently address this outstanding issue in NEAFC  and to keep WCPFC members abreast during the coming weeks of the result of this administrative process  including any relevant action for the Boyang Capella noting that to its knowledge the vessel remained on  the WCPFCs RFV  In addition to the NEAFC case the EU noted its concern over several repeated issues  of noncompliance with the WCPFCs obligations that  were identified again during the  2020 CMR process  for Panama As the EU highlighted in 2019 while recognizing improvements made by Panama on the  management of its fishing fleet it noted with concern that Panama has been again identified as priority non compliant especially for obligations related to the Transhipment CMM The EU stated that transhipment at  sea must be strictly monitored and controlled so as to mitigate the risks of facilitating IUU fishing operations  that undermine sustainable fisheries Therefore the EU stated that it strongly believes that Panama must  achieve clear and concrete progress in addressing the shortcomings in compliance with WCPFC  transhipment rules as matter of priority and urgency In conclusion the EU stated that if in light of the above  CCMs supported the granting of CNM status to Panama for 2021 the EU would not oppose this decision  but that in the absence of tangible progress by Panama it would be very difficult for the EU to support an  application for  the renewalof Panamas CNM status in 2022
WCPFC17,75,China thanked the EU  and stated it  would like to see that  Panamas CNM status be continued for
WCPFC17,76,2021 China urged Panama to carefully note the EUs statement and ensure it made significant progress  on  the issues raised in the near future
WCPFC17,77,Panama stated that it had provided detailed explanations on the issues raised in the CNM SWG It  stated that it was complying with the requirements of NEAFC which would include a fine to the Boyang  Capella suspension of  the vessels license and withdrawal of the vessel from the RFVs of all RFMOs  Panama acknowledged past difficulties in meeting certain deadlines including with regard to the Boyang  Capella but stated its understanding that all supporting documents would be available in January 2021  Panama noted some improvements made during 2020 and stated it would strive to do even better in 2021
WCPFC17,80,The Commission approved the CNM application from Panama and referred it to the CNM SWG to  consider the participatory rights to be granted to Panama
WCPFC17,81,The CNM SWG presented its report to the Commission including recommended limits to be  applied to the participatory rights of each CNM in 2021 During the CNM SWG Ecuador had reiterated  their interest in becoming a full member of the Commission and the SWG had noted that the issue of  membership would be taken up by the Commission and was outside the mandate of the SWG
WCPFC17,82,The Commission discussed the participatory rights to be granted to CNMs and whether any limits  should be placed on the number of carrier vessels The Bahamas stated that it had indicated in comments  submitted to the Commission in October 2020 that it would have 30 carrier vessels in 2021 China stated  that it would support the wording regarding participatory rights agreed to in the CNM SWG but stated its  view that in the future the Commission should give consideration when granting participatory rights to  specifying the number of carrier vessels for each CNM
WCPFC17,83,The EU stated that many years after entry into force of the Convention the Commission still lacked  a procedure for consideration of applications for full membership It referenced a paper submitted by the  USA in 2017 WCPFC142017DP18 Membership Process in WCPFC that contained an overview of  other RFMOs  membership processes and the benefits to the Commission of a more open approach to  membership The EU stated that no progress had been made since then and raised the issue as an outstanding  item that should be duly addressed
WCPFC17,84,Japan supported the EU intervention It noted the concerns expressed by some CCMs while stating  that WCPFC should at a minimum have a process for discussing applications from potential members
WCPFC17,85,Palau on behalf of FFA members reiterated the FFA position expressed at WCPFC15 and  WCPFC16 that the application for CNM status is not a stepping stone to becoming a full member of the  WCPFC It requested deletion of the inclusion of a question in the CNM application form on whether an  applicant wants to become a member stating it is not a relevant consideration for the granting of CNM  status It noted that Article 352 of the Convention sets out the procedural requirements for membership
WCPFC17,86,FSM on behalf of PNA members stated that under the Convention WCPFC has a different and less  open process for considering new members compared to other fisheries Commissions In the WCPFC new  members can only join by invitation and that invitation has to be decided by consensus PNA members  further stated that the process reflects the nature of the Commission where over 85 of the catch is made in  the waters of developing countries especially SIDS who are highly dependent on those resources PNA  members stated that the CNM process provides adequate opportunities for participation by countries other  than those who were engaged in the process of drawing up the Convention PNA members stated they do  not support the EU proposal for an additional process relating to Commission membership
WCPFC17,87,Ecuador expressed its appreciation to the WCPFC by accepting Ecuador as a CNM since 2009  Ecuadornoted it  had committed to fully comply with the WCPFCsCMMs and administrative and financial  obligations and had done so over the years Ecuador stated it had expressed its desire to become a full  member of  WCPFC at several WCPFC annual meetings but unfortunately Ecuadors official request had  not received a positive response Given this Ecuador stated it was officially requesting once again what the  legal procedure would be to achieve that objective suggesting that it should be clear fair and transparent  Ecuador recalled that at WCPFC14 the USA delegation delivered a discussion document on this issue  WCPFC152017DP18 and that it had been raised again by the EU Ecuador stated that these analyses  could facilitate consideration of this important matter It noted that in 2015 WCPFC took a first step by  implementing a change in the CNM application form in which candidate countries were asked whether
WCPFC17,90,they would like to become full members In this regard Ecuador inquired as to the benefit of this question  and if there has been any followup Ecuador noted that the general framework of RFMOs states that no  State or group of States that have a real interest in the fisheries should be discriminated against and that  Ecuador and most WCPFC members are members of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas  UNCLOS as well as the UNFSA which are the foundation of the international legal framework for oceans  and fishing In this regard Ecuador stated it considers that having officially and repeatedly expressing to  WCPFC  its interest  in becoming a full  member without even receiving a response constituted  discrimination and a violation of the UNCLOS and UNFSA rules Finally it noted that the foregoing  contrasts with the treatment that has been given in other RFMOs By way of example since the new IATTC  Convention was adopted in Antigua Guatemala in 2003 IATTC opened its door for several coastal states  not located in the Eastern Pacific Ocean such as Belize the Peoples Republic of China and Kiribati to  become full members without any barrier Ecuador reiterated its request that the Commission consider  establishing a framework and conditions to allow interested countries with CNM status to become full  members Ecuador closed by reiterating its interest in becoming and requested to be accepted as a full  member of the WCPFC
WCPFC17,91,The Commission noted the strong concerns from TCC16 regarding DPRKs application and  decided to deny CNM status for DPRK
WCPFC17,92,The Commission accepted the report of the Cooperating NonMember Small Working Group  SWG and noted that
WCPFC17,93,i The SWG had noted with appreciation the attendance and participation of The Bahamas  Curaao Ecuador El Salvador Liberia Panama Nicaragua Thailand and Vietnam  ii The SWG confirmed that all CNM applications were complete and all additional information  requested by TCC16 had been submitted  iii SWG participants expressed concern surrounding the recent listing of two Panamanian  flagged vessels on the IUU Fishing Vessel Lists of NEAFC and CCAMLR One participant  notedthatPanamas applicationforCooperating NonContracting Party status in NEAFC for  2021 was denied by the organization Panama acknowledged the concerns expressed by  members and submitted additional information on the actions taken by Panama to address  the issues which included sanctions and the revocation of vessel licenses Panama confirmed  that the vessels included in NEAFC IUU List A would be removed from the vessel registers  of all RFMOs including WCPFC until the process is concluded In relation to the vessel  included in CCAMLR NonContracting Party IUU Vessel List Panama informed that this  vessel was selfreported by Panama and it no longer flies the Panama flag since March 2020  iv The SWG supported the application of Panama for CNM status in 2021 but encouraged  Panama to continue to make improvements to the management of vessels both in the  WCPFC and in other RFMOs The SWG noted that in the absence of tangible progress and  improved compliance with WCPFC management measures it would be difficult for the  Commission to support an application from Panama for CNM status in 2022  The Commission approved the applications for CNM status for 2021 from The Bahamas  Curaao Ecuador El Salvador Liberia Nicaragua Panama Thailand and Vietnam

WCPFC17,117,Vietnam The participatory rights of Vietnam in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier  and bunker vessels only
WCPFC17,119,In accordance with the decision of WCPFC9 regarding the management of the overlap area of
WCPFC17,120,4S and between 130W and 150W vessels flagged toEcuador ElSalvador Nicaraguaand Panama will
WCPFC17,122,In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions fishing vessels flying  the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are  not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly  migratory species in the overlap area
WCPFC17,123,For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with  international and domestic laws vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC  will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by  voluntarily providing VMS reports date time and position to those coastal States when operating in the  overlap area
WCPFC17,128,On behalf of FFA members New Zealand presented WCPFC172020DP01 FFA Key Priorities  for the WCPFC17 referring in particular to Attachment 1 Proposed List of Obligations to be assessed under  the Compliance Monitoring Scheme in 2021 FFA members stated they recognized the list of obligations for  assessment by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme CMS as a priority item for the Commission at  WCPFC17 and in that context submitted the proposal in Attachment 1 for WCPFC17 consideration New  Zealand stated that in the absence of the riskbased assessment approach the proposal takes into  consideration
WCPFC17,129,the factors identified in CMM 201906 paragraph 6    the proposal tabled by the United States at TCC16    members views expressed on this issue at TCC16    obligations assessed under the CMS and the percentage of past noncompliance    the need to be mindful of the volume of obligations to be assessed on an annual basis given the  burden it will put on the WCPFC Secretariat TCC and CCMs in particular SIDS and    ensuring that the CMS is effective and efficient balanced and fair amongst the different fisheries  within the Commission  New Zealand noted that the Secretariat submitted to FFA and through the ODF its views on the  proposed list with regards to the obligations related to the WCPFC Decisions under the context of COVID19  WCPFC17202009 WCPFC17 Online Discussion Forum Summary Topic K1 In particular the  Secretariat noted they may not have enough information to be able to review each CCMs implementation  of these requirements FFA members therefore agreed to remove these obligations from the list to be  assessed in 2021 but stated they would seek a decision under Agenda Item 5 for CCMs to report in 2021  on their implementation of these decisions in their Annual Part 2 reports and for the Secretariat to prepare a  paper  on  this for  TCC17s  consideration  FFA members also received and responded to comments and  questions from the United States through the ODF and looked forward to working with all CCMs towards  an agreed list for 2021 FFA members further proposed that an SWG be established to discuss and agree on  the list of obligations to be assessed under the CMS in 2021 and nominated Mat Kertesz from Australia to  lead this SWG
WCPFC17,130,The EU thanked FFA for the proposal and for addressing some of its comments made at TCC16
WCPFC17,131,The list of obligations to be assessed under the CMS was discussed further under Agenda Item 102
WCPFC17,133,The United States stated it had withdrawn a previously submitted proposal to revise several aspects  of the tropical tuna measure WCPFC172020DP02 Proposal for a CMM for Tropical Tunas This  followed discussions during 2020 with a number of other CCMs to understand their positions and  expectations for WCPFC17 It recognized that the challenges in meeting electronically would make  substantive discussions and consensusbuilding difficult In light of this and as explained in its message  circulated on December 7 the United States has decided pending review of the precise language of the  CMM to support a rollover of the tropical tuna measure It stated its understanding that a rollover is the  expectation of most if not all other CCMs Although the USA would support a rollover at WCPFC17  because of the extraordinary circumstances and limited time available it emphasized that its proposal in  DP02 reflects important issues and objectives for the United States and its stakeholders and that it remained
WCPFC17,136,committed to looking for equitable solutions to stakeholder interests and concerns and looked forward to  engaging on those issues in 2021 The USA stated it recognizes that the fisheries managed through the  measure are very important to all CCMs including SIDS and territories that are particularly dependent on  fisheries and as such all CCMs deserve the opportunity to work through these issues in a spirit of  cooperation The USA stated that its proposal highlights the important issues that will need to be addressed  in developing future versions of the measure specifically noting the following
WCPFC17,137,Some openended exemptions undermine the effectiveness of WCPFCs conservation regime    USAflagged vessels in both the longline and purse seine sectors are hamstrung by allocations that  are much more restrictive than necessary to meet  the Commissions conservation objectives and
WCPFC17,138,despite often applying monitoring control and surveillance measures that exceed those that apply  to other fleets
WCPFC17,139,American Samoa as a small island Participating Territory is suffering a disproportionate  conservation burden from the measure and continues to push the United States to insist on changes  that will support its fisheriesdependent economy  The USA stated that WCPFC17 needs to agree on a clear intersessional process with a timeline to make  progress on improving the measure in 2021 including to address the outstanding work identified in CMM  201801 and to conduct good faith negotiations on the priorities raised It stated its openness to different  ways of progressing that work and that it envisions the Commission Chair andor Vice Chair leading the  intersessional work which could be done through email correspondence and virtual meetings until WCPFC  can again meet in person The USA stated that progress made intersessionally will inform its ability to agree  on a measure in 2021 when CCMs must be prepared to make needed adjustments to the CMM The USA  stated its recognition that its proposal conflicted with the views of some other members on how the regions  collective fisheries should be managed It noted its intent was not to inflame but to reflect that its industries  feel disadvantaged and are concerned about their very survival It observed the need to respect the needs  and interests of other members including in particular the SIDS and territories and stated it was willing to  work hard towards a CMM that works for all CCMs While that has not been possible in 2020 as CCMs  adjust to the new virtual format the USA stated it hoped and expected all CCMs would be in a better position  to do that hard work in 2021
WCPFC17,140,The intersessional process for developing a new tropical tuna measure was further discussed under  Agenda Item 72
WCPFC17,142,The Philippines introduced WCPFC172020DP06 Request to amend Attachment 2 of CCM 2018
WCPFC17,143,01 It stated the objective was to significantly reduce postharvest losses improve quality and increase the  market value of the Philippine tuna catches from the High Seas Pocket No 1 and to comply with Republic  Act No 10611 to strengthen the food safety regulatory system The Philippines recommended that  Attachment 2 of CMM 201801 be amended byremoving the adjective traditionalfreshchilled preceding  the word fishing vessels  in Section 1 The recommended amendment  would allow the use of freezers in  carrier boats or refrigerated vessels thereby significantly reducing postharvest loss and ensuring catch  quality  DP08
WCPFC17,144,The USA introduced WCPFC172020DP08 Conservation and Management Measure for North  Pacific Striped Marlin Consultative Draft Proposal It recalled that in 2010 WCPFC adopted a CMM  establishing catch limits for CCMs that had historically caught North Pacific striped marlin however
WCPFC17,147,reductions in CMM 201001 were inadequate to eliminate overfishing or rebuild the stock stock  assessments conducted in 2015 and 2019 found the stock to be overfished and experiencing overfishing In  2019 WCPFC adopted an interim rebuilding plan with an interim rebuilding target of 20SSBF0 to be  reached by 2034 with at least 60 probability the plan includes the following rebuilding strategy
WCPFC17,148,Beginning in 2020 and based on the best scientific information available members will develop  measures to rebuild the stock in accordance with the rebuilding objective with the aim of adopting  revised conservation and management measures for North Pacific striped marlin at WCPFC17  Members should consider reduced catch limits and retention release and gear requirements  among other potential tools
WCPFC17,149,The USA stated that its consultative draft revised CMM for North Pacific striped marlin was designed to  ensure that the interim rebuilding target is met according to the specifications of the interim rebuilding plan  adopted in 2019 Attachment 1 to WCPFC172020DP08 It noted that it investigated the efficacy of  requiring live release of all captured striped marlin elimination of the shallowest hooks on deep sets and  the use of circle hooks as potential mitigation methods The USA stated that while none of these measures  would meet the rebuilding target as standalone requirements they could help to reduce catch if used with  other mitigation options The USA proposed that CCMs consider the consultative draft revised CMM as a  basis for intersessional consultations with the aim of adopting a revised CMM at WCPFC18 The USA also  noted some discrepancies between ISC stock assessment catch estimates of striped marlin in the Convention  Area north of the equator and WCPFC catch estimates for that area by CCM and stated it was working  with SPC to improve the WCPFC estimates and better understand reasons for the differences
WCPFC17,152,Indonesia introduced WCPFC172020DP09 Proposal for a CMM on Labour Standards for Crews  on Fishing Vessels Indonesia noted cases and disputes had taken place over several years with regards to  crew welfare on fishing vessels operating within the Commission Area In the spirit of responsible fisheries  management and common decency Indonesia considers these disputes to be labour abuse issues It stated  that fishing crews have been subjected to abuse forced labour and human trafficking because of the absence  of proper labour and wellbeing standards training and insufficient language aptitude and that workers  exploitation forced labour and human trafficking in capture fisheries are connected to transnational crime  and corruption The expanding worldwide interest to harvest more fish far from national waters and the need  for cheap workers to ensure these fishing operations are profitable also leads to labour abuse Vessel owners  and operators can have a competitive advantage by crewing their vessels with cheap labour Indonesia stated  that under WCPFC Resolution 201801 Resolution on Labour Standards for Crew on Fishing Vessels  CCMs are encouraged to make every effort to ensure that their relevant national legislation fully extends to  all crews working on fishing vessels flying their flag in the Convention Area and where appropriate and  applicable CCMs are encouraged to adopt measures into their national legislation to establish minimum  standards regulating crew labour conditions Furthermore CCMs are encouraged to implement measures  consistent with generally accepted international minimum standards for the crew on fishing vessels where  applicable to ensure fair working conditions on board for all their flagged vessels operating within the  Convention Area However cases of labour abuse are nonetheless continuing in the region As a member of  WCPFC Indonesia acknowledged that the issue of labour rights for the crews of fishing vessels needs  broader attention particularly with respect to making and implementing binding regulations and stated that  it therefore submitted the draft proposal on the issue in DP09 which proposes improved measures on  tackling labour abuse through the implementation of law and policy comprehensive research on the effect  of labour abuse for fisheries as a system more knowledge sharing among members handling similar cases
WCPFC17,155,increased communication and awareness among stakeholders including media government inter government agencies fishing operators migrant workers and consumers and representatives of fishing  industry employees and workers and improved cooperation and coordination among WCPFC CCMs  Indonesia welcomed any input from CCMs and proposed to have an Intersessional Working Group draft a  CMM during 2021 for submission to TCC Indonesia underlined its willingness to work constructively and  cooperatively with other delegations
WCPFC17,156,Vanuatu on behalf of FFA members thanked Indonesia for bringing forward its proposal on this  very important matter As noted at previous meetings FFA members are appalled by the continued instances  of crew abuse in the region including towards Indonesian nationals FFA members have approved an  amendment to the minimum terms and conditions on labour standards for fishing crews and stated it is  appropriate that the Commission begins work on a compatible measure for the high seas The draft CMM  proposed by Indonesia provides a basis to begin that process and FFA members congratulated Indonesia for  bringing this forward They noted that considerable work would be required to develop a practical CMM  but FFA members believe it essential that the Commission instigate a process to move forward FFA  members supported the establishment of an IWG on crew labour standards and stated their strong position  that that the Commission is the right place to address this issue
WCPFC17,157,New Zealand expressed support for the comments by Vanuatu on behalf of FFA and by Indonesia  It agreed that the establishment of an IWG is appropriate and that it is appropriate and essential that the  Commission consider these issues New Zealand acknowledged that other regulatory agencies also have a  role but that this does not preclude efforts on the part of WCPFC
WCPFC17,158,The Philippines stated that it fully supports formation of an IWG and that it would fully engage in  the process It noted that it already has domestic regulations that addresses labour standard on fishing vessels
WCPFC17,159,The USA supported Indonesias interventionalignedwith the comments by New Zealand and FFA  and supported the formation of an IWG
WCPFC17,160,China stated that it did not support the proposal and would not support the formation of an IWG
WCPFC17,161,Korea thanked Indonesia noting that the issue of rights and welfare of crew is very important and  that calls to address the issue were increasing It stated that it had been closely working with industry  stakeholders to prevent possible incidents on Korean fishing vessels and would join the IWG if it is  established and would cooperate fully on the issue
WCPFC17,164,Masanori Miyahara the Chair of the Northern Committee NC introduced the revised CMM for  Pacific Bluefin Tuna as contained in Attachment B of WCPFC17202018 Reference Document for the  Review of CMM 201902 and Development of Harvest Strategies Pacific Bluefin Tuna The NC Chair  stated that NC16 agreed on the recommendation which would allow a oneyear rollover of CMM 201902  He also stated the revised measure would delete the previously allowed catch limit transfer from Chinese  Taipei to Japan
WCPFC17,169,The EU introduced WCPFC17202011rev1 Discussion Paper on IUU Vessel Cross Listing  Procedures   revision 1 noting that a full proposal was tabled at WCPFC16 and a range of concerns were  expressed by FFA members The EU stated it had reflected on these concerns and provided additional  insights in the hope of addressing the points made by FFA members The EU stated that in light of the  reduced agenda of WCPFC17 it did not intend to table a proposal for adoption in 2020 but rather sought  to collect views comments and inputs from CCMs with the objective of continuing the discussion  intersessionally ahead of WCPFC18 and in the hope of working toward adoption of crosslisting measures
WCPFC17,170,Tuvalu on behalf of PNA members requested the WCPFC Secretariat to advise intersessionally  how many vessels would be on an expanded IUU List under the crosslisting proposal noting that this  information would help in assessing any burden associated with the proposed measure
WCPFC17,173,The EU introduced WCPFC172020DP12 Discussion paper on Improving the Effectiveness of  CMM 201801 The EU stated that the aim was to address the unintended effect of the exemptions in CMM  201801 and to better understand how these exemptions are used and to take into account the full range of  implications and potential impacts deriving from their use on the effectiveness of the CMM for tropical  tunas andor its successor CMMs The paper has three sections i the effects of the FAD closure ii the  trend of increasing effort by CCMs that are not bound by limits in the high seas and iii and the potential  for use of exemptions beyond their intended purpose through misinterpretation of the attribution of catch  and effort under paragraph 8 of CMM 201801 The EU stated that these issues in particular the use of  exemptions potentially make TCC assessments difficult and most importantly might severely weaken the  effectiveness of CMM 201801 in the near future The issues were further discussed under Agenda Item  722
WCPFC17,174,AGENDA ITEM 5   INTERSESSIONAL DECISIONS IN RESPONSE TO COVID19
WCPFC17,175,The Secretariats discussion paper  WCPFC17202008 COVID19 Related Intersessional  Decisions was presented by the Legal Adviser Dr Penny Ridings The paper updates WCPFCTCC162020 14 provided to TCC16 on the measures taken as of 10 November to prevent the spread of the  COVID19 on fishing vessels and on travel and port entry restrictions in CCMs The Legal Adviser  highlighted some of the context and the questions posed for WCPFC17
WCPFC17,176,i The Legal Adviser first reviewed the Intersessional Decisions    The Commissions first Intersessional Decision temporarily suspended the 100 observer  requirement on purse seine vessels She noted that most ROP observers have been repatriated with  the exception of 23 observers Of those the majority remain on board vessels including carrier  vessels either to continue their duties or pending suitable arrangements for repatriation Some  observers are awaiting repatriation in another country    The second Intersessional Decision states that where it is not feasible to tranship in port CCMs may  authorise their purse seine vessels to tranship at sea in areas designated by port States within its  jurisdiction Assessing the implementation of this decision has proven difficult She stated that it  21
WCPFC17,178,appears most purse seine transhipments are taking place in an area designated by the port State at  the wharf or within the general area of the port even if not at the wharf One port State has  designated an area beyond three Nautical miles for this purpose but this appears rare Five CCMs  have notified the Executive Director of their authorised vessels but have implemented the Decision  in different ways either by way of a blanket authorisation or by notification of individual  transhipment events on a vesselbyvessel basis
WCPFC17,179,The third Intersessional Decision suspended the requirement to have atsea transhipment observers  on either the fishing or carrier vessel Of reported transhipments between 1 April and 23 October  2020 approximately 9 of transhipments were not observed The relatively high rate of  observations results from some observers on carrier vessels not yet being repatriated There are  likely to be fewer observed transhipments in 2021 until observers on carrier vessels are redeployed  ii The Legal Adviser noted that assessing implementation was difficult and stated that to facilitate a  review at TCC17 of the implementation of the Intersessional Decisions the Commission could  consider the following as suggested by the Secretariat in comments to WCPFC172020DP01  WCPFC17202009 discussion under Topic K a CCMs could be required to provide in Annual  Report Part 2 covering 2020 activities a specific report on their implementation of the Intersessional  Decisions taken in response to COVID19 b task the Secretariat to include in Annual Report Part  2 covering 2020 activities appropriate questions that can suitably support CCMs reporting on their  implementation of the Intersessional Decisions taken in response to COVID19 and c task the  Secretariat to prepare a paper for TCC17 that provides a summary of the available information on  the implementation of the COVID19 Intersessional Decisions in 202021  iii The Legal Adviser made the following observations in describing the context of the Commissions  consideration of the Intersessional Decisions it is not clear when a return to normal observer  requirements will be feasible while some observer data is still coming in SPC has indicated that  the prolonged suspension of observer requirements could compromise certain scientific assessments  TCC16 noted the importance of placing observers safely back on vessels and referred to the possible  use of the FFA COVID19 Operating Protocols and to date the COVID19 decisions have been  temporary   usually of 3 or 4 months duration to enable periodic assessments of the situation to be  made  iv The Legal Adviser encouraged the Commission to consider the following issues    The appropriate timeframes for lifting of the suspension of obligations under the three Intersessional  Decisions whether priority should be given to reinstatement of atsea transhipment observers on  carrier vessels and the necessary conditions for this to occur    Implementation issues associated with the suspension of the prohibition of atsea transhipment for  purse seine vessels the lack of clarity on the number of port States that are undertaking  transhipments outside the general area of their ports and within their internal waters and whether  the suspension should be tightened and its implementation clarified    Challenges associated with redeployment of observers on purse seine vessels to once again meet the  100 observer coverage requirement whether a staged approach to redeployment is feasible and  the conditions under which redeployment should occur    The Commissions position on the  FFA Operating Protocols  v The Legal Adviser also encouraged the Commission to consider preparing and circulating a draft  decision prior to expiry of the current Intersessional Decisions on 15 February 2021 Given the  continued uncertainty over what the situation will be in 2021 an indication of the period of validity  22
WCPFC17,181,of any Decision would be useful It would also be useful if WCPFC17 could agree to use the same  expedited decisionmaking process as used for the original COVIDrelated Intersessional Decisions
WCPFC17,182,RMI on behalf of FFA members noted that they proposed in WCPFC172020DP01 a list of  obligations to be assessed under the CMS in 2021 of which six are related to decisions taken in response to  COVID19 They noted the views from the WCPFC Secretariat posted to the ODF regarding review of  implementation of intersessional decisions WCPFC17202009 Topic K Upon consideration of these  views FFA members suggested that the Commission
WCPFC17,183,task CCMs to provide in their 2021 Annual Report Part 2 covering 2020 activities a specific report  on their implementation of the Intersessional Decisions taken in response to COVID19    task the Secretariat to include in 2021 Annual Report Part 2 covering 2020 activities appropriate  questions that can suitably support CCMs reporting on their implementation of the Intersessional  Decisions taken in response to COVID19 and    tasks the Secretariat to prepare a paper for TCC17 providing a summary of the available information  on the implementation of the COVID19 Intersessional Decisions in 2020  FFA members stated that CCMsfulland effective implementation of  the Intersessional Decisions remained  critical including ensuring all reporting requirements are clear and consistently applied to allow the  Commission to assess the impacts of the decisions and guide future decisions
WCPFC17,184,The EU stated it could support the proposal but suggested that when considering future decisions  that the Commission include better guidance on how it expected CCMs to implement and assess its  decisions
WCPFC17,185,Tuvalu on behalf of FFA members thanked CCMs and vessel operators for their assistance in  safely repatriating observers to their home countries during the temporary suspension of observer coverage  requirement for purse seine vessels and at sea transhipment They reiterated that their end goal is to ensure  that observers can safely return to fishing vessels after 15 February 2021 To support this end goal of  deploying observers FFA members encouraged all CCMs to implement the FFA COVID19 Operating  Protocols and for the Commission to recognise them as voluntary best practice guidelines to minimise  COVID19 transmission on fishing vessels They stated their understanding that no alternate COVID19  Protocols for fishing vessels had been put forward to the Commission and stressed that the protocols are  extremely important for helping prevent COVID19 transmission FFA members highlighted that they are  considering requirements to be met by vessel operators in order for FFA members to be comfortable  deploying observers on purse seine vessels again FFA Members noted the WCPFCSecretariats suggested  framework elements and process which is a useful way forward for the COVID19 Intersessional Decisions  in particular the staged approach to redeploying observers and the emphasis on Article 295 should there  be any dispensation due to the COVID19 on atsea transhipment except where a port State designates an  area within its territorial sea for transhipment purposes
WCPFC17,186,The EU observed that the absence of observers for long periods may impact the collection of  scientific data but that it was difficult to assess the impact without more information and inquired regarding
WCPFC17,187,i the rate of observations in 2020 noting that some CCMs have embarked observers throughout their  operations ii how observer data gaps could impact the work of SPC in the short term and iii whether  the Secretariat or SPC have suggestions on how to compensate for the lack of observers The Compliance  Manager Dr Lara ManarangiTrott stated the Secretariat would consult with SPC and seek to provide an  answer to these questions  23
WCPFC17,189,PNG stated that the observer program is essential to provide and verify data and compliance relating  to a number of WCPFC CMMs It inquired how the lack of observers impacted assessment of WCPFC  stocks PNG also noted that the ability to safely place observers on vessels during the COVID19 pandemic  would be different for domestic and international operations as the latter presented logistical issues and  required resumption of international flights
WCPFC17,190,The USA supported extension of the Commissions Intersessional Decisions until observers can be  placed safely on the vessels without increased risk from COVID19 It noted that the USAs  industry went  to great length and expense to repatriate all observers from its vessels and remained concerned that some  observers have not yet been repatriated It noted that timely repatriation of all observers where requested  is a requirement of the Commissions  Intersessional Decisions and urged all CCMs to implement the  decisions quickly and equitably The USA stated it would support discussion of proposed frameworks for  continuing to make intersessional decisions related to COVID19 and generally supported implementing  an expedited intersessional process for expedited review of the suspension of purse seine observer coverage  to ensure that the suspension does not become the norm Given the rapid evolution of information and best  practices related to COVID19 the USA stated that it would be impractical to implement regional guidelines  or protocols months ahead of a vaccine and observer deployment Further given that COVID19 related  decisions are likely beyond the authority of most fisheries officials the USA stated it would not support  adoption of binding COVID19 guidelines through WCPFC
WCPFC17,191,The EU sympathized with all observers that are still stranded and noted that the safety of observers  and crew is of paramount importance ItaffirmedPNGs statementthatthecurrentproblem was more related  to the logistics and the risk related to bringing observers aboard and then repatriating them rather than to  the risks to observers while onboard It noted that the FFA Operating Protocols included guidelines for  onboard safety but the issue was how to come up with options for getting observers to vessels The EU  suggested that before simply renewing its Intersessional Decisions the Commission could consider  alternatives that could compensate for the lack of data The EU made several suggestions have vessels call  in at ports that have strong observer programs have SPC possibly develop a stratified sampling program  and have certain vessels collect a minimum amount of data and possibly rely on port sampling while waiting  for the situation to return to normal It stressed that any decisions adopted intersessionally should be  accompanied by clear reporting requirements which is not currently the case
WCPFC17,192,China stated it appreciated the Commissions  actions with respect to the Intersessional Decisions  and noted it was uncertain when the situation would return to normal and suggested the Commission  carefully consider the situation and then extend the current decisions intersessionally China stated that it  had been very difficult to meet the 5 observer coverage requirement on longline vessel on the high seas in  2020 and hoped that TCC17 could consider not assessing this requirement in 2021
WCPFC17,193,The Ocean Foundation on behalf of The Pew Charitable Trusts WWF and the International Pole  and Line Foundation IPNLF thanked the Legal Advisor and CCMs for their contributions and urged  CCMs to commit to redeploying observers as soon as it as safe in order to ensure that the necessary data on  fishing and transhipment operations are collected They also noted the urgent need to progress work on  electronic monitoring EM standards and develop a draft CMM on EM as a comprehensive EM program  would be a key way to increase the resiliency of the observer program and reduce impacts of any future  shocks to the fisheries management system
WCPFC17,194,The Chair asked the Commission to consider the process for addressing the Intersessional Decisions  noting that the current COVID19 Intersessional Decisions expire on 15 February 2021 and the constraints  of virtual meeting made it difficult to address these decisions at WCPFC17 She suggested the Commission  could consider whether a draft Decision could be prepared based on discussions at WCPFC17 and circulated
WCPFC17,197,in good time prior to the expiry of the current Intersessional Decisions WCPFC17 could give an indication  of the period of validity of any Intersessional Decision and WCPFC17 could agree that this and any  subsequent Intersessional Decisions be subject to the same 7day expedited decisionmaking process as used  for the original Intersessional Decisions
WCPFC17,198,Japan supported the suggestion made by the Chair regarding the process and stated its  understanding that in light of the deadlines a draft decision would by necessity be circulated by early  February It suggested a short extension possibly 2 months would be appropriate with a 7day decision  process Regarding the FFA Operating Protocols Japan thanked FFA members for formulating these but  noted that its authority had also issued guidelines and that each CCM faces a different situation related to  COVID19 Therefore recognizing the FFA operating protocols as bestpractice guidelines would be  difficult for Japan it stated its respect for the efforts of FFA members but could not support the recognition  by the Commission of the voluntary Operating Protocols as bestpractice guidelines
WCPFC17,199,China supported the statement by Japan with regard to the FFA COVID19 Operating Protocols
WCPFC17,200,Chinese Taipei expressed its appreciation to FFA members for tabling the COVID19 Operating  Protocols It reflected on the effort taken by CCMs to protect the safety of observers and crew and noted  the need to respect that different members have different measures It noted that it would accept if the FFA  protocol is voluntary for other CCMs In terms of the process for extension of the Intersessional Decisions  it supported circulation of a draft by early February as suggested by Japan It also noted the need to have a  grace period for the industry when reinstating observer requirements as restrictions may differ among ports  and it takes time for the vessels to carry observers back onboard fishing vessels
WCPFC17,201,The USA supported the interventions by China Japan and Chinese Taipei It stated its appreciation  for the FFA Operating Protocols while noting that the USA had continued to place its observers on vessels  during the COVID19 pandemic It maintained 100 observer coverage in the swordfish fishery and 15  in its longline fisheries but had challenges in the fishery in American Samoa because of flight restrictions  The USA stated it is important that all measures that were not suspended be assessed including observer  coverage as this was not waived unilaterally stressing that it was important to understand the reasons for  any noncompliance and the resultant impact
WCPFC17,202,FSM stated it was encouraged that many CCMs supported the Operating Protocols and encouraged  that CCMs are developing their own guidelines At TCC16 CCMs were encouraged to share any protocols  to ensure there is consistency of applications so the Commission can ensure that safety of observers and  crew as observers are redeployed FSM asked that all CCMs to share their protocols and guidelines
WCPFC17,203,Pew on behalf of Pew The Ocean Foundation Birdlife WWF Marine Stewardship Council ISSF  and IPNLF stated that to date WCPFC had handled the chaos of the COVID19 pandemic relatively well  as noted by the discussions at WCPFC17 but had done so in part by delaying some decisions that otherwise  would have been made in 2020 Development of an effective vaccine provides hope of a return to facetoface  meetings where discussions can be more productive but the logistics and efficacy of a vaccine program  makes it uncertain whether WCPFC will be able to return  to  normal meetings  in 2021 as noted by the  Chair in her opening remarks As such they urged WCPFC to dedicate some time to discussing how it can  make progress in such a circumstance stating that the recent developments in IATTCwhere it appears  there may be no measure managing tropical tunas as of January 2021was a stark reminder of an unwanted  outcome from ineffective negotiations in a virtual environment Pew stated that 2020 has involved a steep  learning curve and everyone had gained insight into  what  works  and what doesnt  under travel restrictions  within WCPFC as well as other RFMOs and urged all CCMs to build on that knowledge to ensure that 2021  is not another year to delay progress
WCPFC17,206,FSM suggested that the Commission could request that the Secretariat could develop COVID19  best practices based on the FFA Operating Protocols and those developed by other CCMs In reply the  Executive  Director  referenced the  Secretariats dedicated  COVID19 webpage and its standing request to  all CCMs to provide any relevant information regarding COVID19 for posting and information sharing He  suggested that WCPFC17 task CCMs with providing pertinent COVID19 information to the Secretariat for  posting
WCPFC17,207,Japan stated it supported the dissemination of information related to COVID19 protocols or  guidelines and would consider providing its information to the Secretariat for posting on the WCPFC  webpage Regarding the FFA proposal it stated the situation relating to COVID19 differs among CCMs  and that best practice may vary
WCPFC17,208,China stated it understood that the FFA Operating Protocols could be applied for vessels fishing in  FFA waters and entering ports of FFA member countries but noted that many vessels fish far from FFA  membersEEZs where those protocols should not be required It also stated it was very difficult to provide  comprehensive documents related to its own COVID19 protocols in English to WCPFC China suggested  simply recognizing that the FFA protocols are one of the best and apply voluntarily to operations in FFA  waters
WCPFC17,209,Australia stated it was encouraging to hear so many CCMs taking the issue so seriously It noted  that the FFA Operating Protocols were the result of a collective regional effort to address COVID19  Australia referenced the susceptibility in the Pacific to COVID19 stating that this was why FFA members  had been asking CCMs to cooperate It stated that any protocols must be appropriate for the region and  must be adequate to keep the Pacific Islands and observers safe and for that reason sought to have CCMs  share their protocols
WCPFC17,210,The USA stated it recognized that the CCMs that had developed the FFA Operating Protocols  considered them appropriate The USA recognized that when observers return to vessels various issues  would need to be considered including the need to conform to certain regional terms and conditions and  that discussion of those issues would need to be held in the future The USA stated that it had recorded no  cases on vessels in the Convention Area including vessels operating from American Samoa Hawaii Guam  and Saipan but that the USA had experienced cases in other areas such as Alaska For that reason it did  not support a single approach to COVID19 as being appropriate for all vessels in all areas
WCPFC17,211,The Commission noted the paper on COVID19 related Intersessional Decisions prepared by  the Secretariat WCPFC17202008
WCPFC17,212,To facilitate a review at TCC17 of the implementation of the COVID19 Intersessional  Decisions the Commission agreed to
WCPFC17,213,require CCMs to provide in Annual Report Part 2 covering 2020 activities a specific  report on their implementation of the Intersessional Decisions taken in response to  COVID19
WCPFC17,214,task the Secretariat to include in Annual Report Part 2 covering 2020 activities  appropriate questions that can suitably support CCMs reporting on their  implementation of the Intersessional Decisions taken in response to COVID19 and
WCPFC17,217,further task the Secretariat to prepare a paper for TCC17 that provides a summary  of the available information on the implementation of the COVID19 Intersessional  Decisions in 202021
WCPFC17,219,noted the importance of placing observers safely back on vessels
WCPFC17,220,agreed to work intersessionally on a process so that observers can be redeployed  safely on vessels
WCPFC17,221,agreed that a draft COVIDrelated Intersessional Decision will be circulated at the  end of Januaryearly February 2021 for decision by the Commission under the 7day  expedited decisionmaking process for COVID19 Decisions
WCPFC17,222,tasked the Secretariat to followup the discussion at WCPFC17 and assist in the  development of future COVID19 Decisions and
WCPFC17,223,noted with appreciation the FFA COVID19 Operating Protocols and encouraged  CCMs to share their own national COVID19 Operating Protocols in order to  broaden the database of COVID19 measures on the WCPFC website
WCPFC17,225,61 Implementation of Article 30 of WCPF Convention and CMM 201307 SIDS special  requirements  The Chair noted that paragraph 20 of CMM 201307 requires an annual review of implementation  of this measure and referenced WCPFC162020IP01 Summary from Part 2 CMM 201307 paragraph  19 annual reports WCPFCTCC16202011rev1 and the EU posted WCPFC172020DP10 Report of  the European Union on Article 30 of the Convention and Resolution 200801 of WCPFC EU both papers  were taken as read
WCPFC17,226,Japan stated it fully recognizes the importance of the criteria in CMM 201306 and carefully  considers the checklist contained in the CMM when submitting a proposal Japan agreed with FFA members  that CMM 201306 can only be effectively addressed by consulting with SIDS either individually or  through FFA Japan further considered that multiple consultations are required because the position of both  sides on important issues usually develop gradually towards annual meetings Japan stated that unfortunately  it could not have physical meetings with FFA and PNA members in 2020 due to COVID19 but that it did  hold several virtual consultations Japan urged other members to contact FFA and PNA members and stated  it hopes to visit Honiara and Majuro to meet physically in 2021 Japan stated it has been providing SIDS  with assistance for infrastructure and capacity building through the Japan International Cooperation Agency  and Overseas Fishery Cooperation Foundation OFCF During 2009 to 2018 Japan provided about 180  billion in development assistance to the Pacific islands including fisheryrelated projects Fisheryrelated  projects cover conservation and management of highly migratory species and assistance to smallscale  fishermen At the Eighth Pacific Leaders Meeting held in Japan in 2018 Japan pledged to implement  development cooperation over the three years with particular focus on human resource development to date  approximately 61 billion has been contributed in development assistance Japan has also carried out human  resource development and peopletopeople exchanges for about 6500 people In addition in 2008 Japan
WCPFC17,229,established the Japan Trust Fund JTF within WCPFC which has been assisting capacity building of SIDS  for fishery statistics and fishery management Japan reminded CCMs that a call for proposals for the JTF  was sent to CCMs on November 17 through WCPFC Circular No 2020135 and encouraged SIDS CCMs  to apply by the deadline of 22 December In addition Japan stated it has supported SIDS since 2008 through  the Japan Promotion Fund via OFCF and that SIDS can utilize this fund for various purposes including  enhancement of management capacity In November 2017 in response to the strong request from SIDS  OFCF signed a 10year renewal of its agreement with FFA Also in 2020 OFCF increased the size of its  Promotion Fund Japan stated its hope that these programs and funds will contribute to fishery development  of SIDS
WCPFC17,230,The EU stated it submitted a comprehensive report of its assistance to SIDS in WCPFC172020DP10  It remarked that it had received no comments on the report and requested feedback from CCMs  regarding the utility of the report and the usefulness of the actions it describes
WCPFC17,231,RMI thanked Japan for its comments regarding CMM 201306 and thanked Japan for their  continued support RMI noted that the requirements of CMM 201306 are simple It stated that the analysis  of impacts on SIDS was inconsistent in new proposals and that CMM 201306 analyses must be  implemented in the manner that was envisaged by the measure and that this should be a strict requirement  for proposals in the future
WCPFC17,232,The USA thanked CCMs who intervened on the issue stating that it understands the importance of  the agenda item to all SIDS and territories The USA stated it reports on its support provided through the  WCPFC and outside WCPFC through an attachment to its annual report Part 2 and inquired whether it  should continue this approach in the future It noted that it had assumed that such reports were accessible to  other CCMs but that it had trouble finding these The USA stated that the process under CMM 201306 for  assessment and consultation was very important as the Commission engages on CMM 201801 update and  that this applied to all SIDS and territories The USA encouraged CCMs to ensure their consultations also  covered American territories including American Samoa
WCPFC17,233,The EU stated its understanding that RMI had suggested the EUs discussion paper  WCPFC172020 DP11rev1 Discussion paper on IUU Vessel Cross Listing Procedures did not follow CMM 201306  as FFA members would have expected The EU noted that the paper is not a proposal but aims to address  the concern expressed by FFA members regarding the impact proposals have on SIDS
WCPFC17,234,The Compliance Manager stated that the CMM 201307 provided by each CCM in Annual Report  Part 2 are accessible on the Article 30 page on the Commission website She stated in response to the query  from the USA that the Secretariat would ensure that any attachments are also included
WCPFC17,235,WCPFC17 continued to recognise the importance of assessing the impact of proposals on SIDS  in accordance with CMM 201306
WCPFC17,236,62 Updated Strategic Investment Plan  The Chair noted the Secretariats  report  on the  updated status of the Strategic Investment Plan  WCPFC17202010 which was taken as read
WCPFC17,237,The Commission noted with appreciation the update provided by the Secretariat on  implementation of the Strategic Investment Plan WCPFC17202010
WCPFC17,240,The Commission approved the updated 2020 Strategic Investment Plan Attachment E
WCPFC17,242,71 General overview of stock status bigeye skipjack South Pacific albacore yellowfin Pacific  bluefin North Pacific albacore  Dr John Hampton SPC presented an overview of the stock status of bigeye skipjack South  Pacific albacore and yellowfin tuna including an update on recent events in the fisheries focussing on  longline and purse seine activity and a summary of the stock status of the major species as references he  noted WCPFC172020IP02 The Western and Central Pacific Tuna Fishery2019 Overview and Status of  Stocks and the WCPFC Tuna Fishery Yearbook 2019 The 2019 total catch of 30 million mt was the  highest recorded the purse seine catch of 211 million mt was also a record Total effort in effort days in  the purse seine fishery by the large international fleet declined since peaking in 2011 indicating that a day  of purse seine effort today is more effective than it was 78 years ago Regarding the use of FADs and  unassociated set types by the purse seine fleet there was an increase in unassociated sets and a slight decline  in FAD sets but total catch was split fairly equally between these set types although in 2019 there was a  strong increase in catch attributed to unassociated sets Preliminary data on effort in fishing days in 2020  shows it to be slightly higher than average for the last 10 years Tropical purse seine CPUE has increased  somewhat over the last decade In 2020 there was a decline in CPUE as indicated by VMS data which show  longer trips but further analysis will be possible once more log sheet data has been received by SPC The  longline fishery has had fairly stable catch around 250000 mt over the last 20 years Species composition  is also relatively stable with a slight decline in bigeye in recent years There was a significant increase in  effort in the late 1990s In 2019 longline effort was fairly high but short of the record VMS data shows  2020 longline effort was the highest since 2012 The tropical longline fishery 20N to 10S shows variable  total effort over the last 20 years with no strong trend the same is true of bigeye and yellowfin catch Bigeye  and yellowfin CPUE shows some decline since the early 1990s but has been stable over the last decade The  southern longline fishery south of 10 S targets south Pacific albacore it shows a strong increase in effort  up to early 2000s with some recent increase The catch is fairly constant since 2010 while CPUE has  declined moderately over some years CPUE in 2019 was close to the lowest overall since 1990 In terms  of stock status all major tuna stocks are in good condition with 0 probability of breaching the TRP In  comparison with other tuna RFMOs the WCPFCs  Convention Area is the only ocean area and WCPFC is  the only tuna RFMO whose key tuna stocks not overfished or experiencing overfishing With regard to  levels of spawning biomass depletion the spawning biomass depletion ratio has declined over time for the  four major stocks but the ratios including the uncertainty boundaries are all well above the LRP of  20SBSBF0 Projections 25 year of spawning biomass depletion which use recent levels of catch and  effort indicate bigeye yellowfin skipjack all remain well above the LRP for all bounds of uncertainty For  South Pacific albacore the uncertainty is much greater if current levels of catch and effort are maintained  the median level of spawning biomass depletion shows some chance of exceeding the LRP in the future  Among other species southwest Pacific striped marlin is likely overfished North Pacific striped marlin  oceanic whitetip shark and Pacific bluefin tuna are likely overfished and experiencing overfishing and  Pacific silky shark is likely experiencing overfishing All other species are either not overfished or  experiencing overfishing or data are inconclusive Regarding the El Nino Southern Oscillation the current  La Nina will continue through the second quarter of 2021 The current negative sea surface temperature  anomaly should ease in next few months There is currently a westward intrusion of cold water which  pushes the purse seine fishery to the west and this is confirmed by recent VMS data
WCPFC17,243,Japan requested clarification on four issues i purse seine effort trend ii whether the increase in  purse seine CPUE and trip length in recent years indicates vessels must spend more time to find fish and
WCPFC17,246,whether the number of set per day has increased iii whether SPC incorporates any efficiency increase  when conducting stock projections given that catch efficiency appears to have increased in the past and
WCPFC17,247,iv what accounts for the larger uncertainty in the projection of South Pacific albacore stock compared  with other 3 main tuna species  Dr Hampton replied as follows i regarding purse seine effort effort as measured in days fished  showed a decline while effort in terms of the number of sets was fairly constant He indicated that there has  been a gradual increase in the number of sets per day and thus the overall number of sets has remained  fairly constant and referred to a paper on effort creep submitted to SC16 SC16MIIP15 Examining  Indicators of Technological and Effort Creep in the WCPO Purse Seine Fishery ii there is a gradual  increase in purse seine CPUE for a given trip length from CVMS data iii regarding future catchability  increases it is hard to foresee how effort may evolve and thus all projections assume constant catchability  SPC does advocate for harvest strategy approaches which can better respond to increases in catchability  This is examined in more detail in SPCs harvest strategy work and details are available on WCPFCs  website and iv the uncertainty for South Pacific albacore is greater because of the strong variability in  growth across all models There is a recommendation that SPC conduct a new stock assessment for South  Pacific albacore in 2021 and SPC will examine growth in connection with that stock assessment He noted  that recruitment variability also contributes to the wider confidence intervals
WCPFC17,248,Dr John Holmes ISC Chair made a presentation on the stock status of North Pacific albacore and  Pacific bluefin tuna and provided an update on Western and North Pacific striped marlin For North Pacific  albacore a benchmark assessment was conducted using fishery data from 1994 to 2018 Total biomass age  1 has declined from 916529 mt 1995 to 641391 mt in 2018 Total and spawning biomass increased  between 2016 and 2018 SSB201820SSBcurrent F0  230 The ISC concluded that the stock is likely not  overfished relative to the limit reference point Although no Fbased reference points have been adopted to  evaluate overfishing current fishing intensity F20152017 is likely at or below seven potential reference  points Two harvest scenarios were considered constant F20152017 and constant catch The constant catch  scenario was found to impact uncertainty estimates in projections If a constant fishing intensity is applied  to the stock then median female spawning biomass is expected to increase to 62873 mt and there will be a  low probability of falling below the 20SSBcurrent F0 LRP by 2028 Furthermore if a constant average catch  C20132017  69354 t is removed from the stock in the future then the median female spawning biomass is  also expected to increase to 66313 mt and the probability that SSB falls below the LRP by 2028 will be  slightly higher than the constant fishing intensity scenario A benchmark assessment was conducted for PBF  using 19522018 fishery data SSB declined from 62784 mt 1995 to 10837 mt 2010 and has slowly  increased to 28228 mt 2018 The estimate of SSB2018 is 3000 mt greater than SSB2016 due to increase in  young fish 02 years The belowaverage recruitment for 20102014 was a concern in the 2016 assessment  The 2017 and 2018 recruitment estimates are also below average There has been a substantial decrease in  F for ages 02 in 20162018 relative to previous years As for the stock status no biomassbased reference  points have been adopted for PBF However the PBF stock is overfished relative to potential biomassbased  reference points SSBMED and 20SSBF0 adopted for other tuna species by the IATTC and WCPFC The  recent 20162018 FSPR is estimated to produce 14SPR Although no fishing mortalitybased limit or  target reference points have been adopted for PBF recent fishing mortality is above the level producing  20SPR However the stock is subject to rebuilding measures including catch limits which do not  compromise the capacity of the stock to rebuild as shown by the projection results Under all examined  scenarios rebuilding to SSBMED by 2024 with at least 60 probability is reached and the risk of SSB falling  below historical lowest observed SSB at least once in 10 years is negligible The projection results assume  that the CMMs are fully implemented and are based on certain biological and other assumptions Given the  low SSB the uncertainty in future recruitment and the influence recruitment has on stock biomass  monitoring recruitment and SSB should continue so that the recruitment level can be understood in a timely  manner In response to a request from NC15 that the ISC provide advice on which future recruitment
WCPFC17,251,scenario is the most likely one over the near term for striped marlin the ISC found that there is a linearly  decreasing trend in estimated recruitment with time If the longterm recruitment scenario is used for future  projections then the observed longterm recruitment time series requires the assumption that there is no  time trend The ISC concluded that the shortterm recruitment scenario is most appropriate for conducting  MLS projections In response to a request from NC15 that the ISC explain why the striped marlin stock  decreased and the fishing mortality increased after a drastic decrease in fishing effort by high seas driftnet  fisheries in the early 1990s the ISC could not provide a straightforward explanation at present in part  because it is difficult to identify explanatory factors due to uncertainties in assessment model The ISC  Billfish Working Group will attempt to address this issue in the next assessment of this stock ISC concluded  that there is no change to the stock status of striped marlin As for conservation information if the stock  continues to experience recruitment consistent with the shortterm recruitment scenario 20122016 then  catches must be reduced to 60 of the WCPFC catch quota from CMM 201001 3397 mt to 1359 mt in  order to achieve a 60 probability of rebuilding to 20SSB03610 mt by 2022 This change in catch  corresponds to a reduction of roughly 37 from the recent average yield of 2151 mt In addition  retrospective analyses ISC19ANNEX11 show that the assessment model appears to overestimate  spawning potential in recent years which may mean the projection results are ecologically optimistic
WCPFC17,252,The USA stated that the information provided would support adopting the rebuilding plan approved  by WCPFC16 for North Pacific striped marlin and removing the interim  designation
WCPFC17,253,The EU referenced discussions at SC16 regarding the status of Pacific bluefin tuna and the decision  by ISC to not use a grid approach to structural uncertainty the EU suggested that resulting projections are  therefore relatively optimistic The EU inquired why the ISC continued to use this approach and whether it  could be envisaged to undertake a benchmark exercise the results and compare the robustness of the two  approaches In relation to North Pacific striped marlin the EU referenced that the WCPFC Convention  defines MSY as a default target reference point for all stocks The ISC Chair stated that ISC was optimistic  on the probability of achieving rebuilding of the stock The Chair of the ISC Pacific Bluefin Tuna Working  Group Dr Shuya Nakatsuka noted that SPC in conducting analyses for WCPFC had only recently started  employing structural uncertainty grids which were used mainly to address data inconsistencies There are  very detailed data available for Pacific bluefin tuna which clearly shows the biomass trend of the stock and  the data are very consistent For that reason the Working Group has adopted a bestcase approach to find  the best model to fit the data He stated that sensitivity tests are also used to check if the current model has  the best fit He stated that they were aware of the issues raised by the EU but did think the results generated  were necessarily optimistic He stated the various points that had been raised would be considered for the  next stock assessment The ISC Chair concurred regarding the default TRPs mentioned by the EU and  stated that they sought to illustrate that these defaults may not be the best choices for particular stocks
WCPFC17,254,Korea noted its concern regarding the stock status of North Pacific striped marlin and expressed  interest in working with the USA on their proposal detailed in WCPFC172020DP08 in 2021 Korea  inquired why the initial rebuilding target 20SSB F0 used a timeframe of 2022 The ISC Chair stated that  this date was set in CMM 201001 when 2022 presumably seemed to be far into the future
WCPFC17,255,The Commission noted the stock status of bigeye yellowfin skipjack and South Pacific albacore  as presented by the Scientific Services Provider SPC
WCPFC17,256,The Commission noted the stock status of North Pacific albacore Pacific Bluefin tuna and North  Pacific striped marlin as presented by the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tunalike  Species in the Northern Pacific Ocean ISC
WCPFC17,259,72 Bigeye Skipjack and Yellowfin  721 Harvest Strategy Issues  7221 Review of target reference point for skipjack  Dr Graham Pilling SPC presented WCPFC17202011 Updates to WCPO Skipjack Tuna  Projected Stock Status to Inform Consideration of an Updated Target Reference Point which is an update  of WCPFC16201914SC162020MIWP02 and made the following points
WCPFC17,260,i The paper presents the results of analyses requested by WCPFC16 and SC16 to assist WCPFC17 in  its review of the performance of the interim skipjack tuna TRP in particular examining candidate  revised interim skipjack TRPs of 42 44 46 48 and 50 of SBSBF0 It also provides  further requested information to aid WCPFC17 paras 258 and 259 of the WCPFC16 Summary  Report on    the formulation of TRPs for skipjack tuna noting  o  SC15 advice on  a skipjack tuna  TRP that  the  Commission may identify  a reference  year  or set of years which may be appropriate to use as a baseline for a skipjack TRP and  o  the approach to the formulation of a skipjack tuna TRP proposed in WCPFC162019DP01  and    the impact of effort creep estimated in relation to the TRPs  ii The WCPO skipjack tuna assessment agreed at SC15 incorporated new information on the biology  of the stock eg the pattern of maturityatlength a new spatial structure and new model settings  In a similar way to the assessment of WCPO bigeye tuna performed in 2017 this changed the  perception of the status of the stock and its productivity compared to the model upon which  decisions on the skipjack TRP was based CMM 201506 The paper compares the results of the  2014 2016 and 2019 assessments to illustrate this As requested by WCPFC16 the paper also  presents a comparable analysis to that of WCPFCMOWWP03 using the agreed 2019 skipjack  assessment and indicates changes in effort and biomass depletion from 2012 and recent 2015  2018 average levels and median equilibrium yield as a proportion of MSY associated with  strategies that maintain a median of spawning biomass depletion SBSBF0 at WCPFC16specified  depletion levels These are compared tothe results  under  2012 baselinefishing levels 2012  effort  levels in the purse seine fishery and recent catch levels in IndonesiaPhilippinesVietnam domestic  fisheries Under baseline 2012 fishing levels the stock is predicted on average to fall slightly  compared to recent  20152018 levels 44 SBF0 to 42 SBF0 This is very slightly below  2012 depletion levels but is an equivalent  SBF0 value at 2 decimal places Examining the four  other median depletion levels requested by WCPFC16 50 48 46 and 44 SBF0 these  levels imply reductions in purse seine effort from 2012 levels of 7 to 25 lead to predicted  increases in spawning biomass from 2012 levels of 318 and either maintained biomass at  recent levels or predict an increase by 513 Total equilibrium yield is predicted to reduce  compared to that  under  2012 baseline  levels to 6978 of MSY There was no risk of falling  below the LRP associated with any of these depletion levels based on the current uncertainty  framework  iii SC16 requested additional information comparing TRP levels to baseline years used for other  tropical tuna stocks in CMM 201801 20122015 average conditions and an indication of the  recent effort levels relative to the 2012 baseline used here For the former a column has been added  to the results table For the latter recent effort levels in terms of numbers of sets in the tropical purse  seine fishery have been 87 20152018 average and 98 2019 levels of those in 2012 SC16  32
WCPFC17,262,also requested an analysis of the TRP where fishing mortality rather than fishing effortcatch was  maintained The results of that analysis are presented in Annex 3 of WCPFC17202011
WCPFC17,263,iv Regarding the additional two requests from WCPFC16 SC15 advised that WCPFC16 might  identify  a  reference year  or  set  of  years  which may be  appropriate  to use as a baseline for a  skipjack TRP WCPFC162019DP01 called for  a TRP that  is consistent  with the  level of fishing  effortforskipjack in 2012 and the condition ofthe skipjack stock in 2012 The textdefining  a TRP  should refer to the management objectives that the TRP is designed to achieve The formulation as  specified in WCPFC162019DP01 does that and is suitably explicit in that it allows the technical  reestimation of the appropriate TRPconsistent stock depletion value when new knowledge of the  stock is obtained as for skipjack here It is broadly consistent with the approach adopted for South  Pacific albacore However SPC notes two things    The assumption has been made that 2012 fishing effort levels are those in the purse seine fishery  specifically as this is not specified within the TRP text    As examined within this paper this formulation is consistent 2012 fishing conditions lead to  an equilibrium  stock status equal  to that  in 2012 but  care must  be taken if the incorporation  of increased biological or fishery understanding within the skipjack assessment meant this  consistency was then lost Therefore the weighting of each objective the fishing effort and  2012 stock status should be specified  v WCPFC16 requested advice on whether effort creep should be considered when identifying TRP  levels In theory where the primary management objective was to maintain a level of CPUE within  the fishery this might need to be considered In practice this is not feasible as the future level of  effort creep within the purse seine fishery is not known Estimates of historical trends if available  do not necessarily indicate future fishery performance while assuming some arbitrary level of effort  creep within an analysis could lead to an inappropriate TRP level if that effort creep assumption  were to prove incorrect Therefore effort creep within the purse seine fishery has not been assumed  in these analyses To ensure objectives are met if effort creep occurs an adaptive approach where  the management settings are reviewed as required over time is suggested as the most appropriate  This would occur automatically within the harvest strategy framework where management  procedures robust to effort creep can be identified and the monitoring strategy can identify whether  the adopted management procedure is effective  Japan stated that this issue had been discussed for several years whether 42SBF0 is equivalent to  50 SBF0 based on the latest stock assessment Japan made the following points i inquired regarding the  comparison of depletion trajectories Figure 2 in WCPFC17202011 and asked for clarification regarding  the fluctuations in these trajectories for the 2014 2016 and 2019 stock assessments ii noted that  calculating an interim TRP based on a new stock assessment differed from establishing a TRP for skipjack  as the latter must take into account biological and socioeconomic factors and iii regarding effort creep  noted that SPC suggests adaptive management which would be incorporated into management procedures  but inquired how this would be done and what parameter would be put into the management model
WCPFC17,264,In response to i SPC clarified that the 2014 and 2016 stock assessments had very similar spatial  structures with 5 regions The 2019 model has an 8region structure and the model must then fit to all the  data within it using different maturityatlength data and spatial structure This can account for some  differences between the 2019 and other trajectories However in the recent period postabout 2007 the  2019 stock assessment depletion trajectory is below those for 2014 and 2016 Regarding ii SPC stated  that in the future the 2019 stock assessment would be the basis of its assessment and harvest strategy work  and ensuring management reference points are consistent with that perception of the stock would be helpful
WCPFC17,267,Regarding iii SPC stated that in the stock assessment it assumes that catchability is constant In the harvest  strategy operating model SPC can assume that effort does not remain constant SPC can adjust the effective  effort to try and capture the range of uncertainty and effort creep and then see how effective the management  procedure is at dealing with this and whether the stock remains around the TRP over time
WCPFC17,268,PNG on behalf of FFA members noted the work by SPC in support of the discussions relating to  the TRP for skipjack and thanked SPC and all CCMs for work in support of the development of a harvest  strategy for skipjack However FFA members stated their concern that these efforts may be at a risk of  being delayed if the Commission is not able to agree to a TRP FFA members stated they have carefully  considered the results of the analysis requested by WCPFC16 from SC16 on the formulation of a skipjack  TRP and understand that a depletion ratio of 42 SBF0 is consistent with the objectives for the fishery that  defined the previous interim TRP FFA members stated that this should be adopted by this Commission  noting that
WCPFC17,269,the assumption has been made that the 2012 fishing effort levels are those in the purse seine  fishery specifically and    that the weighting of each objective the fishing effort and 2012 stock status should be  specified  If the Commission is unable to agree on a TRP for skipjack at WCPFC17 and to aid in ongoing discussions  on the TRPs in 2021 FFA members requested that SPC provide additional analysis on the options of 36  38 and 40 depletion ratio TRPs FFA members stated they look forward to reengaging with all CCMS  during 2021 and hope for a productive discussion of a new TRP for skipjack at SC17 and WCPFC18
WCPFC17,270,The USA stated its view that the interim skipjack TRP of 50 remains in effect the fact that the  Commission did not adopt a new TRP does not mean the interim TRP lapsed It suggested that a rollover of  the tropical tuna measure should maintain the text in paragraph 13 which refers to the interim TRP The  USA stated it was open to revising the interim TRP noting two approaches had been suggested by  decreasing it noting that SPCs workprovides the information needed to do that or by expressing the TRP  so it is directly tied to conditions in 2012 or another baseline year this would require deciding whether to  link to the stock size level of effort CPUE or both and then weight in some specific way The USA noted  this was addressed in WCPFC17202011 and advocated by FFA members The USA suggested that if the  Commission ties the TRP to a specific level of effort or CPUE it need not translate that to a specific stock  size It could simply say 2012 level  of  fishing effort for  example  The USA looked forward to further  discussion on this in 2021
WCPFC17,271,Indonesia inquired i whether the decrease in the depletion trajectory using the 2019 stock  assessment reflected biological parameters used in the analysis or was because of the new regions or other  factors such as the increase in the purse seine catch in 2019 and ii regarding the level of risk beyond  2019 In reply SPC stated regarding i that it would have to review the impact of the change in regional  structure and the biological information Regarding ii in terms of risk of being below the 42there is no  risk of falling below the LRP if the stock is on average at 42 based on the current risk framework used in  the current projection work If the TRP was 42 then on average there is a 50 risk of being above or  below the TRP at any time
WCPFC17,272,Solomon Islands on behalf of PNA members supported the FFA statement and maintained support  for a skipjack TRP as formulated by FFA in WCPFC172020DP01 PNA members stated that deciding  on a revised skipjack TRP is critically important  to maintain the momentum  of  the Commissions work on  Harvest Strategies and they looked forward to a revised TRP being adopted when circumstances allow
WCPFC17,275,Chinese Taipei commented regarding effort creep that fishing effort showed a substantial decline  since 2011 while catch has increased indicating there is clear effort creep in the fishery Chinese Taipei  stated they understood that it is difficult to predict effort creep in the future but suggested estimates for past  effort creep could be made to gain an appreciation of how large it is Chinese Taipei stated its understanding  that effort creep was not included in the skipjack stock assessment and inquired whether the current stock  status would be more pessimistic if effort creep was included
WCPFC17,276,SPC stated that effort appears to have declined while catch is fluctuating but is relatively stable  overall It stated that its preference would be to be able to estimate how much of that is due to biological  factors and how much to effort creep SPC noted it examined factors such as sets per day for SC but that  these are simply indicators SPC has a staff member dedicated to getting results on this issue Regarding the  effect on the skipjack stock assessment abundance is based on the pole and line fishery and SC is looking  at using purse seine information in region 8 SPC noted that the pole and line industry is changing rapidly  and SPC is looking at transferring to a purse seinebased abundance index in the future
WCPFC17,277,The EU noted that prior to 1990 the depletion trajectories for SBSBF0 exceed 1 and asked i how  this is possible and inquired ii whether the median depletion level of 42 in 2018 based on the 2019  assessment was correct The EU stated that the Harvest Strategy concept is new for all CCMs noting that  when the TRP was adopted it was not expected that changes in the stock assessment could have such an  impact on the TRP The EU supported defining the TRP so that the Commission does not have to face a  similar situation for other species in the future and noted the useful proposals in the SPC and FFA papers  The EU also noted the need for fairness It stated that while it would agree that the measure that was adopted  for the SKJ TRP was aiming at maintaining the status quo of the reference period it has not expired  observing that other measures have similar provisions and these have not expired just because they have  not been reviewed The EU agreed with the USA that the CMM is still in place and that there was a need  to revise the CMM to reflect the Commissions intent SPC replied regarding i that over a 10year period  it was possible to have the spawning biomass exceed the unfished spawning biomass leading to a ratio  greater than 10 as seen in the late 1980s in the 2019 skipjack projections and ii that the figure of 42  SB2018SBF0 is specific to 2018 and calculated in the same way as LRPs and differs from the SBrecentSBF0  that appears in some stock assessments or SC reports
WCPFC17,278,RMI on behalf of PNA members supported the view in WCPFC172020DP01 that the CMM  201506 is redundant and should be removed from the WCPFC list of active CMMs The CMM states in  paragraph 2 that  the  interim  TRP set  out  in the CMM shall  be an interim  target  reference  point  until  it  is  reviewed  Last year the Commission reviewed the interim TRP and could not agree on a revised TRP On  that basis PNA considers that there is no interim TRP in place and supported the FFA proposal for CMM  201506 to be removed from the WCPFC list of active measures
WCPFC17,279,Japan agreed with the USA and the EU that unless the Commission agreed to eliminate CMM 201506  it remained in force Japan noted that the CMM does not state it will expire in the absence of an agreement  in 2019 Japan noted that it had consulted with the Legal Adviser on the issue of the interim TRP and  confirmed that  Japans understanding is correct Japan also observed that the CMM 201506 TRP is an  interim TRP changing the 50 to say 42 is one thing but did not address the TRP that needed to be  selected for use in the harvest strategy or management strategy for tropical tuna
WCPFC17,280,USA observed that there was a consensus that the TRP needed to change Regarding whether the  interim TRP remained in effect the USA noted that no member had made a proposal to change CMM 201506  which is directly referenced in other CMM eg paragraph 13 of CMM 201801 and that as such the  CMM would by necessity remain in force
WCPFC17,283,RMI on behalf of PNA members requested that a note be placed on the List of Active Measures to  indicate that most CCMs consider that CMM 201506 is not active In response the USA objected to the  inclusion of such a note noting there was no consensus regarding the CMMs current  status or  changing its  status
WCPFC17,284,The Legal Adviser confirmed that CMM 201506 provides in paragraph 8 for a review in 2019  and thereafter whenever relevant information may be made available She stated there is no indication in the  measure of an intent for CMM 201506 to expire if no agreement on a review was reached before 2019 In  addition the context of CMM 201506 as a whole and the fact that it is referred to in other CMMs indicates  there is no automatic expiry of CMM 201506 if the 2019 review produced no result
WCPFC17,285,The Commission noted the presentation by SPC of the results of analyses it undertook to assist  WCPFC17 in its review of the performance of the interim skipjack tuna TRP
WCPFC17,286,The Commission agreed to continue intersessional work to review and revise as appropriate a  TRP for skipjack in the future
WCPFC17,287,The Commission requested SPC to update the skipjack TRP work by including additional  candidates including 36 38 and 40 in the median depletion table
WCPFC17,288,7212 Target reference point for bigeye and yellowfin  Dr Steven Hare SPC presented WCPFC17202012rev1 SC16Requested Analyses to Inform  WCPFC17 Discussions on Candidate Target Reference Points for WCPO Bigeye and Yellowfin Tuna New  stock assessments for WCPO bigeye and yellowfin tuna agreed to by SC16 indicated that both stocks are  on average not overfished nor subject to overfishing This paper presents results of analyses requested by  SC16 to assist WCPFC17 in the identification of interim target reference points for WCPO bigeye and  yellowfin tuna stocks Tables 1 3 in WCPFC17202012rev1 It presents the stock and fishery  consequences of SC16defined stock depletion levels SBSBF0 consistent with specified historical  conditions and stock risk levels SC16 Outcomes Document paragraphs 7678 For each depletion level  results are presented comparably to those in WCPFC16201914 for skipjack tuna indicating changes in  biomass from both 20122015 and recent 20152018 average levels changes in fishing from baseline  20162018 average levels median equilibrium yield as a proportion of MSY risk relative to the agreed  limit reference point and SC16requested perrecruit metrics Steven Hare made the following points
WCPFC17,289,i Tables 13in WCPFC17202012rev1 indicates that under baseline 20162018 average fishing  conditions both bigeye and yellowfin stocks were projected to increase relative to 20122015  average levels and either remain at recent 20152018 average levels yellowfin or increase  bigeye For both bigeye and yellowfin CMM 201801 specifies that pending agreement on a TRP  the spawning biomass depletion ratio SBSBF0 is to be maintained at or above the average  SBSBF0 for 20122015 Achieving that depletion level for bigeye implied increases in fishing from  20162018 levels by 38 recent recruitment and 22 assuming longterm recruitment and  resulted in a calculated risk of falling below the LRP of 3 recent recruitment or 14 longterm  recruitment For yellowfin it also implied increased fishing by 29 and no calculated risk of  falling below the LRP  36
WCPFC17,291,ii The implications of achieving depletion levels 10 from the 20122015 average levels are also  presented in Tables 1 3 in WCPFC17202012rev1 An alternative SC16specified candidate  reference point was equivalent to 20002004 average depletion levels For bigeye this depletion  level required fishing to be reduced by 4 recent recruitment or 17 longterm recruitment and  resulted in no or a minimal 1 assuming longterm recruitment patterns risk of falling below the  LRP For yellowfin 20002004 average depletion levels implied increasing fishing by 34 from  baseline levels and there was no risk of falling below the LRP calculated at that level Final SC16specified  depletion levels related to those equivalent to a 10 and 20 risk of falling below the  LRP For bigeye this implied increases in fishing by 55 and 70 recent recruitment and 12  and 33 longterm recruitment respectively Under recent recruitments those risk levels were  achieved at stock sizes 1223 lower than 20122015 levels Under the less productive longterm  recruitment assumption those risk levels implied a 6 less depleted stock and 10 more depleted  stock respectively relative to 20122015 average depletion For yellowfin 200 greater fishing  than baseline levels a scalar of 3 was required to achieve a 10 risk level these were considered  unrealistic and a 20 riskbased depletion level was therefore not pursued further for this stock  iii With reference to the riskrelated depletion levels  which represent  minimum  TRP values  consistent with those risk levels as noted in previous papers the choice of a TRP can be based on a  combination of biological ecological and socioeconomic considerations which would likely imply  higher TRP levels than the  minimum  TRPs calculated  As agreed at SC16 within this analysis  purse  seine effort  and longline catch are scaled  equally relative to  baseline levels Scalars are  applied to overall purse seine effort ie both associated and unassociated sets are increased or  decreased with the relative pattern reflecting that over the 201618 baseline period Results will  therefore generally differ from that in the CMM 201801 evaluation being presented to WCPFC17  It should be noted that candidate TRP levels can be achieved under different combinations of future  purse seine and longline levels which will have implications for the other metrics calculated If  desired identification of a limited subset of candidate interim TRP levels is strongly recommended  before that style of analysis is undertaken As noted in previous papers discussing TRP formulation  there is a need to have specific language defining the TRP level based upon the management  objective that the TRP is designed to achieve That language needs to be suitably specific so that  the TRP can be recalculated in the case that in the future new biological or fishery knowledge leads  to an updated perception of stock status from the stock assessments The new information  incorporated within the 2020 yellowfin tuna stock assessment implies a more robust stock than  estimated previously as seen by the minimal risks of falling below the LRP identified at the levels  identified here It should be noted that key areas for further work on the yellowfin assessment were  identified for the coming year and an external review of the assessment is planned for 2022 While  the assessment is viewed as the best scientific information currently available the further work  underway may lead to changes in the perception of stock status and robustness  PNG on behalf of PNA members stated that the analysis indicates CMM 201801 is working well  and is projected to achieve its objectives At this point the major concern of PNA members is the recovery  in purse seine effort in 2020 shown in the SPC presentation and PNA members are interested in seeing  whether this would affect the conclusions of the paper when the full 2020 data become available SPC stated  that as these new data come in and a better estimate of the purse seine effort is available SPC will revisit the  TRP calculations for both species
WCPFC17,292,Kiribati on behalf of FFA members stated that is a substantive issue that requires significant time  and effort to discuss They stated their understanding that there will be an external review of the stock  assessment for bigeye and yellowfin tuna over the next few years although that should not prevent  progressing the Commissions work on developing potential TRPs FFA members stated they will consider
WCPFC17,295,the results of SPCs analysis and the outcomes of the assessment review process when these become  available with the intention of making a decision on the TRPs in the near future and within the time frames  under the Harvest Strategy Work Plan
WCPFC17,296,Indonesia indicated that it found it difficult to consider the results for yellowfin and bigeye when  combined and requested that these two species be treated separately in future to make it easier to follow the  outcomes
WCPFC17,297,Japan inquired whether skipjack could be included when producing tables to show the depletion  ratios in different scenarios acknowledging that this would be complicated because the longline fishery  does not target skipjack SPC stated that it could add skipjack to the analysis and could separate the various  analyses in the future
WCPFC17,298,The Commission noted the presentation by SPC of the results of analyses it undertook on  candidate TRPs for bigeye and yellowfin WCPFC17202012rev1
WCPFC17,299,The Commission agreed it would be difficult to identify TRPs for bigeye and yellowfin during  WCPFC17 and to continue its consideration in the future
WCPFC17,300,The Commission requested SPC to include skipjack equivalent depletion levels and to provide  separate TRP presentations for bigeye and yellowfin in the future to aid the Commissions consideration  of candidate TRPs for bigeye and yellowfin
WCPFC17,301,722 Review of CMM 201801  Dr Paul Hamer SPC presented WCPFC17202014 Evaluation of CMM 201801 for Tropical  Tuna 2020 Update which evaluates the potential for CMM 201801 to achieve its objectives for bigeye  yellowfin and skipjack stocks as specified in paragraphs 1214 of CMM 201801 The evaluations are based  on the most recent SCagreed stock assessments and for all three tropical tuna stocks these now include  data through 2018 The evaluation applies a twostep approach consistent with recent tropical tuna CMM  evaluations first quantify provisions of each option such that translate each specified management option  into future potential levels of purse seine effort and longline catch and second evaluate potential  consequences of each option over the longterm for bigeye yellowfin and skipjack tuna against the aims  specified in CMM 201801 Paul Hamer made the following points
WCPFC17,302,i Step 1 For the evaluation assumptions are required regarding the impact that the FAD closure  period andor high seas effort limits will have on FADrelated effort and the potential future catches  of longline fleets These assumptions are consistent with those made in previous CMM evaluations  and include whether effort and catch limits specified within the CMM are taken by a flag CCM  particularly where those limits are higher than recent fishing levels Under these assumptions SPC  defines three scenarios of future purse seine effort and longline catch based upon a baseline average  period of 20162018 the most recent period available in the latest assessments for all three key  tropical tuna In calculating the implications of CMM 201801 SPC calculated adjusted CMM  equivalent  catches  and effort  for  each baseline year  and then averaged those adjusted values due  to differences in annual management arrangements across 20162018 The scenarios are  summarised as  38
WCPFC17,304,20162018 average purse seine effort and longline catch levels are maintained at the average  levels seen over the years 20162018 providing a baselinefor comparison    Optimistic under a 3 month FAD closure purse seine CCMs make an additional 18th FAD  sets relative to the number in 2016 and 2017 when a 4 month closure was in place ie 8  months FAD fishing in those years The additional2 month high seasFADclosure 5 months  in total on the high  seas  reduces the number of FAD  sets by 18th of  those  made on the high  seas  in 2016 when the 4  month closure was in place In 2017 when the high seas were closed  to FAD fishing all year an additional 7 months of high seas FAD sets based on average  monthly high seas FAD set levels in 2016 and 2018 were assumed to be made In 2018 purse  seine effort was not adjusted as management arrangements were consistent with those under  CMM 201801 CCMs with longline limits take their specified catch limit or 20162018  average level if lower and other CCMs take their 20162018 average catch    Pessimistic every CCM fishes the maximum allowed under the CMM Purse seine CCMs  undertake an additional 18th FAD sets relative to the number over 2016 and 2017 when the 4  month closure was in operation The additional 2month high seas  FAD  closure reduces  the  number of sets by 18th of those set on the high seas in 2016 but increases them by the  equivalent of 7 months for 2017 Where specified high seas  effort  limits allow  additional  fishing relative to actual annual levels in 2016 2017 and 2018 additional FAD sets are assumed  on a proportional basis Limited longline nonSIDS CCMs take their entire specified2000 mt  limits and US Territories take the 2000 mt limit applied in USA domestic legislation 20162018  average level assumed for other SIDS  ii Based on these scenarios and the most recent catch and effort data October 2020 catch and effort  scalars were calculated relative to the 20162018 baseline and these were applied in the stock  projections in step 2 The  Optimistic  and Pessimistic  scenarios assume the change in FAD  closure periods under CMM 201801 equates to a proportional increasedecrease in FAD sets see  also Appendix 1 of WCPFC17202014 Other key assumptions across stocks were that total purse  seine effort remained constant increases in FAD sets led to a decrease in free school sets while  for yellowfin longline catch changes were assumed to proportionally match those evaluated for  bigeye tuna Otherfisheries which haveanotableimpacton  yellowfin stock status were assumed  to remain constant at 20162018 average levels within the analysis  iii Step 2 SPC uses 30year stochastic stock projections to evaluate potential longterm consequences  of resulting future fishing levels under each scenario in comparison to 20162018 average  conditions for each of the three tropical tuna stocks For each projections were run across the grid  of models agreed by SC as the basis for advice WCPFC16 Summary Report paragraphs 275  considered the development of TRPs for bigeye and yellowfin and agreed that in the interim paras  12 and 14 of CMM 201801 be retained and therefore continue to apply to this evaluation However  SPC notes that the interim TRP for skipjack CMM 201506 referenced in CMM 201801  paragraph 13 was expected to be reviewed no later than 2019 Formal review and a decision on the  skipjack TRP are not yet complete WCPFC17202014 therefore does not presume a TRP for  skipjack but expresses spawning biomass depletion relative to 20122015 consistent with bigeye  and yellowfin  iv The potential longterm performance of the CMM against those objectives varied between stocks  For bigeye tuna performance of CMM 201801 was influenced by the assumed future recruitment  levels Table 1 in WCPFC17202014 If recent aboveaverage recruitments continue into the  future all scenarios examined achieve the aims of the CMM in that median spawning biomass is  projected to remain stable or increase slightly relative to 20122015 levels and the median fishing  39
WCPFC17,306,mortality is projected to decline slightly for the 20162018 average  and optimistic  scenarios but  increase for  the pessimistic  CMM  scenario  although still remaining below FMSY If the less  positive longterm average recruitment continues into the future spawning biomass depletion also  improves relative to 20122015 levels for the 20162018 average and optimistic  scenarios but  declines under  the  pessimistic  scenario Under that recruitment assumption future risk of  spawning biomass falling below the LRP SBSBF0  02 increases to between 5 and 19  dependent on the CMM scenario In turn all three future fishing scenarios imply increases in fishing  mortality under the longterm recruitment conditions and for the pessimistic  scenario F exceeds  FMSY at the end of the projection period For  yellowfin and skipjack longterm  historical  recruitment patterns were assumed to hold into the future Results for skipjack Table 2 in  WCPFC17202014 were consistent across the different CMM 201801 scenarios as overall purse  seine effort was assumed to remain constant at 20162018 average levels and the impact of longline  catch is negligible Under 20162018 average  fishing levels and long term  recruitment the  skipjack stock is projected to stabilise at 43 SBSBF0 around 10 lower than the average  depletion over 20122015 while F increases slightly to around 70 FMSY There was no risk of  breaching the adopted LRP but a 1618 risk of F exceeding FMSY by the end of the projection  period Results for yellowfin tuna under all scenarios produced similar results Table 2 in  WCPFC17202014 with the stock stabilising at 5759 SBSBF0 a slight increase above the  target levels in 20122015 and F remaining well below FMSY For all scenarios there was a 0 risk  of breaching the adopted LRP or F exceeding FMSY
WCPFC17,307,v Examining the levels of fishing in 2019 the first year in which CMM 201801 applied purse seine  FAD effortlevels were lowerthan thoseanticipated underthe optimisticCMM scenarioThe total  number of FAD sets decreased by 3 compared to the baseline average The total 2019 longline  bigeye catch was 17 higher than the 20162018 baseline average producing a scalar somewhat  higher than the optimistic  scenario but  lower  than the  pessimistic  scenario Similarly  for  yellowfin the catch was higherthan thatanticipated underthe optimisticscenarioforlongline The  longline yellowfin catch was 37 higher than the 20162018 baseline a level still within the range  estimated for  the optimistic  and pessimistic  longline scenarios The new information  incorporated within the 2020 yellowfin tuna stock assessment implies a more robust stock than  estimated previously as seen by the zero risks of depletion falling below the LRP and F increasing  above FMSY It should be noted that key areas for further work on the yellowfin assessment were  identified for the coming year and an external review of the assessment is planned for 2022 While  the assessment is viewed as the best scientific information currently available the further work  underway may lead to changes in the perception of stock status and the implications of CMM 201801  Appendices 2 to 4 of WCPFC17202014 present the results of additional analyses requested  by CCMs at previous Commission meetings and subsidiary body meetings  The Chairdrew CCMsattention to the specific recommendations from SC16 and TCC16 that relate  to the review of the CMM 201801 as set forth in WCPFC17202013 rev1 Reference Document for the  Review of CMM 201801 and Development of Harvest Strategies under CMM 201406 Bigeye Yellowfin  and Skipjack Tuna WCPFC172020IP03 Summary of the Reports Received Under Tropical Tuna CMMs  20182020 and WCPFC172020IP04 Catch and Effort Tables on Tropical Tuna CMMs
WCPFC17,308,Dr Graham Pilling SPC presented WCPFC17202016 Additional SC16 requested analyses of  relevance to CMM201801 review SC16 requested that SPC provide information to inform the Commission  of options for the tropical tuna CMM SC16 Outcomes Document paragraph 79 see Appendix 1 Following  agreement with the latest stock assessments for WCPO bigeye and yellowfin tuna at SC16 the SC called  for updates to specific plots in SC15MIWP01 Figures 2 and 3 for yellowfin and bigeye tuna  respectively with further summaries of the implications of different fishing levels on these stocks To this
WCPFC17,311,end stochastic projections from the latest bigeye and yellowfin stock assessments have been performed  where future fishery conditions are defined under the specified grid elements of fishing effort purse seine  and catch longline multipliers The resulting levels of bigeye and yellowfin equilibrium stock depletion  SBSBF0 have been estimated The following procedure was used
WCPFC17,312,Stochastic projections were run for 30 years into the future from each 2020 stock assessment model  within the agreed structural uncertainty grid for the bigeye or yellowfin stock    Sufficient projections were performed from each grid model to approximate 1000 simulations for  each purse seine effortlongline catch fishing combination for a stock    Each future purse seinelongline fishing level combination was defined as a multiplier scalar  relative to a baseline average period of 20162018    Future recruitments to the stock were defined by the estimated stock recruitment relationship with  variability around it defined by recruitment estimates from the stock assessment over the most recent  10 years recent recruitment bigeye only orthe longterm 19622016 both stocks    Catchability was assumed to remain constant into the future ie no effort creep    The equilibrium depletion level under  the specified purse  seinelongline fishing combination  was  calculated as the median SB2048SBF0 20382047 after 30 years the median level had reached  equilibrium with the future fishing conditions assumed    Risk of the stock falling below the limit reference point LRP under the specified purse  seinelongline fishing combination was calculated as the proportion of depletion outcomes across  the projections under the specified purse seinelongline fishing combination that in 2048 were below  20SBF0  Results are presented in terms of the equilibrium depletion level and level of risk of falling below the LRP  resulting from each gear combination for bigeye tuna shown in Figures 14 in the paper for recent and longterm  recruitment assumptions and yellowfin tuna Figures 5 and 6 Levels of future fishing anticipated  under CMM 201801 scenarios relative to the 20162018 baseline  period  is summarized in Table 1 in  WCPFC17202016 The presentation also briefly addressed a the relative contribution of purse seine and  longline gears to the change in stock depletion and the approximation of the absolute quantities that  correspond to the scalars for each purse seine scalar numbers of both associated sets and unassociated sets  and for each longline scalar longline species catch in mt SC16 paragraph 79 1a and b fishery impact on  WCPO bigeye tuna SSB by fishery sector for just the diagnostic case model and including longline purse  seine associated purse seine unassociated poleandline and other As noted within other SPCOFP papers  to WCPFC17 the new information incorporated within the 2020 yellowfin tuna stock assessment implies a  more robust stock than estimated previously as seen by the minimal risks of falling below the LRP identified  at the levels identified here It should be noted that key areas for further work on the yellowfin assessment  were identified for the coming year and an external review of the assessment is planned for 2022 While  the assessment is viewed as the best scientific information currently available the further work underway  may lead to changes in the perception of stock status and robustness
WCPFC17,313,France stated its support for a rollover of CMM 201801 and for improvement of the current  measure noting that the virtual meeting would not allow negotiations regarding the CMM in 2020 France  stated that the priority is to avoid any gap in management In identifying priorities to be given consideration  in 2021 France recalled the concerns expressed in relation to maritime pollution by FADs stating that  French territories were impacted on a daily basis by FADrelated pollution France reiterated its growing  concern on the increase in the use of FADs the cost to local authorities associated with the recovery of  discarded FADs and the increase of fishing effort in the high seas and called for the adoption of measures  to address these in 2021  41
WCPFC17,315,Pew observed in reference  to SPCs projections related to CMM  201801 that  the pessimistic  scenario assumes SIDS fleets maintain their catch at current levels in the future and inquired whether it  would not be reasonable to assume some arbitrary levels of growth in those fleets in light  of  SIDS  aspirations SPC replied that it did not know what level of catch should be assumed and therefore within  the analysis catch levels are maintained at current levels
WCPFC17,316,The EU observed in reference to the exemptions in CMM 201801 and their impact on the CMMs  effectiveness that the number of vessels that benefit from footnote 1 in CMM 201801 increased from about  50 in 2018 to about 150 in 2020 that were notified to the Commission and suggested this was more than  50 of the total that could potentially benefit in 2020 The EU inquired if the following questions could be  addressed in similar future work by SPC to help clarify the impact of the exemptions i Are all the notified  vessels setting on FADs during the closure ii What is the number of sets on FADs from these vessels  during the closures iii Are those sets taken into account in scientific analyses eg evaluation of the  performance of CMM 201801 iv Do these vessels use these exemptions on the high seas v Do these  vessels use compatible measures and have those been tested to demonstrate their compatibility in terms of  conservation benefits vi Does the FADs closure exemption affect the robustness of the regular simulations  of future scenarios for purse seine effort when projecting the status of the tropical tuna stocks into the future  and in that case what is the scale of the bias introduced and how can this be overcome in future evaluations  The EU also requested clarification regarding the calculation of purse seine scalars in Table 14 of  WCPFC17202014
WCPFC17,317,SPC stated that there is some confusion regarding the approach to estimating the number of vessels  that fall under this exemption SPCs calculations  finds that  there were  49 distinct vessels in 2018 58 for  2019 and 92 in 2020 with a total of 95 distinct vessels over the 3year period operating under CMM 201801  footnote 1 based on data from WCPFC Circulars Data for the catch and effort for the 92 vessels in 2020  were not yet available Regarding the scalars in Table 14 of WCPFC17202014 the potential impact of  each SC15 additional request has been expressed as the potential change in the overall number of FAD sets  SPC subtracted or  add  those estimated FAD  sets to  the overall  number  under  the  CMM  optimistic  and  pessimisticscenarios and recalculated the purse seine scalars Based upon the assumed impact of a month  of FAD closure on the purse seine effort scalar a months closure being  equivalent  to  a scalar  of  012  relative to the 201618 baseline SPC related the number of FAD sets thus estimated to the equivalent  primary FAD closure period
WCPFC17,318,EU thanked SPC and stated that it hoped its other questions ivi which were also listed in  WCPFC172020DP12 could be captured in future SPC work on this issue Regarding high seas purse  seine effort limits the EU note this is related to the recent trend in fishing effort of CCMs that are not bound  by effort limits which increased from 243 fishing days in 2012 to over 3000 fishing days in 2019  WCPFC172020IP04rev1 Catch and effort tables on tropical tuna CMMs This additional effort  appears to exceed by 50 the total allowable fishing effort of all CCMs listed in Attachment 1 Table 2 of  CMM 201801 The EU had requested that SPC evaluate the impact of this effort that was not accounted for  in the CMM but stated it was unsure that the evaluation was undertaken in the way it had hoped It compares  the actual levels of effort with those expected in the various scenarios which shows the global level of effort  is slightly underestimated but the EU noted that it is important to note that the effort by the CCMs not bound  by limits is buffered by the overall trend in the fishery The EU stated the analysis should take into account  that the effort of those CCMs not bound by limits has increased in recent years The EU stated its hope this  could be addressed in the future and asked if figures based on the data in WCPFC172020IP04 could be  added in the future to allow better visualization of trends SPC stated regarding the issue of nonconstrained  flags fishing on the high seas that effort is included in the baseline period of 20162018 but SPC stated it  now realized that the EU was seeking to address the particular impact of that change on the scalars
WCPFC17,321,Regarding data visualization SPC stated this was possible but there are significant notes that must be  appreciated when viewing trends in the data
WCPFC17,322,The USA acknowledged SPCs efforts to provide updates to help in designing a better measure  and the EU for submitting DP12 and agreed it is very important to take into account all aspects of the  measure including the lack of limits and exemptions and noted SPCs efforts to address those The USA  stated it was important to take into account all those effects and do a thorough analysis when revising the  measure
WCPFC17,323,Australia on behalf of FFA members stated that exemptions in CMMs were there to protect the  development  aspirations of  SIDs and that  FFA  members shared the EUs goal  of  removing  these but that  this would only be possible when SIDS development  aspirations were catered  to in a CMM framework  through agreed limits and allocations that recognize the rights of SIDS as provided for under the Convention  FFA members looked forward to addressing these issues in 2021  EU stated that having the exemptions without a framework leads to results that are detrimental to  the goals of the CMM which is why having an analysis is important as it allows the exemptions to be  framed rather than open ended The EU stated it was seeking to avoid the use of some exemptions beyond  their initial intent observing that it seemed that under some circumstances exemptions granted for SIDS for  the development purposes referenced by Australia are used by nonSIDS which does not in any way  facilitate the development of SIDS  domestic fisheries The EU noted that this was the type of deviation  from the intent of the exemptions that should be addressed
WCPFC17,324,Korea recognized the importance of Article 30 of the Convention and stated that the Commission  should give due consideration to the requirements of SIDS but agreed that the exemptions in CMM 201801  may undermine the intent of the measure Korea stated that the Commission should address the issue  urgently in 2021 by WCPFC18 based on the best scientific information together with the issue of  chartered vessels It stated that in any event the scope of the exemption should not be broadened further
WCPFC17,325,RMI on behalf of PNA members stated that the exemption was not the problem and highlighted  the efforts of SIDS to ensure the sustainability of the stock They stated most SIDS exemptions are in place  because larger developed CCMs insist on flagbased limits based on historical fishing patterns that serve  their interests The SIDS exemptions are there in those cases to protect the interests of SIDS to be able to  exercise their sovereign rights in respect of developing fisheries in their own waters and to participate fairly  in high seas fisheries in accordance with international law The problem in managing high seas purse seine  effort and longline bigeye fishing is the flagbased limits based on historical fishing  as shown in the analysis  in Appendix 3 in WCPFC17202014 PNA members stated that is why the Commission agreed in  paragraphs 28 and 44 of the CMM to work on sorting out the outdated flagbased arrangements so that hard  limits without exemptions can be adopted for high seas purse seine effort and for longline bigeye fisheries
WCPFC17,326,China noted that in 2017 the Commission in a closed meeting addressed the issue of chartering  arrangements and that these have become part of the domestic fleet of SIDS China stated its understanding  that the current issue is that charter vessels do not implement the 3month FAD closure China inquired what  the result was for the bigeye catch noting that if it had increased too much it could be a serious issue It  looked forward to addressing these issues in 2021
WCPFC17,327,PNG stated it wanted to see the removal of exemptions but referenced the issue of capacity and  noted the avenues for cooperation that are developed through charters and other mechanisms PNG stated it  looks forward to the point where it can fully utilize the resources at its disposal and urged all CCMs to  avoid using provocative language in addressing the issue
WCPFC17,330,7221 Purse seine effort limits for the high seas  The USA stated it had been looking forward to a robust discussion and negotiations on the tropical  tuna measure but accepted this was not possible in 2020 It remarked on the improvements in video  technology and the fact that online meetings may be the new norm for a few years and suggested the  WCPFC could not delay adopting a new measure for too long The USA stated its ongoing concern about  the structure of CMM 201801 and how it drives financial dynamics for CCMs With regard to longline  catch limits it stated the Commission should use the available stock for those CCMs that can add quota  without adding capacity so that the risk of overfishing remains low With regard to the purse seine fishery  the USA expressed concern about the viability of its fleet and stated it has proposed some measures to bring  equity to the CMMs The USA also stressed its responsibility for its territories The USA stated that although  it had withdrawn its proposal in WCPFC172020DP02 it had concerns with the current tropical tuna  measure and sought to engage with CCMs in the future through a process that would enable all CCMs to  help shape a CMM that is viable ensures stewardship and provides a structure that allows reasonable  economic viability for fishing vessels The USA offered several suggestions for a process that would ensure  that all CCMs have a voice during the upcoming intersessional work i create a series of working groups  addressing an aspect of the issues under consideration purse seine effort longline quotas FAD  management which would enable continuing progress even if roadblocks were encountered in one area
WCPFC17,331,ii leave WCPFC17 with a clear timetable for starting these workshops the USA suggested the first quarter  of 2021 and iii have the workshops led by the WCPFC Chair and Vice Chair The USA stated the goal  of holding an intersessional meeting in May or June of 2021  American Samoa agreed there is much work to be done intersessionally to enable the Commission  to develop a successor to CMM 201801 It agreed that working groups could be organized and convened  around those issues that are most contentious so those working groups could bring ideas and hopefully some  degree of consensus regarding the issues to the intersessional meeting It stated it would support a working  group on the high seas as this is an important issue to American Samoa because of the relatively small size  of the United States EEZ around American Samoa The fleet of USAflagged purse seine vessels based in  American Samoa to serve the raw material needs of its canneries have historically fished primarily in  neighbouring EEZs and high seas areas When the high seas are unavailable for fishing because of the high  seas limits purse seiners have to operate in fishing grounds more distant from American Samoa and the  boats sometimes find it uneconomical to return to American Samoa to unload their catch In August 2016  NOAA published a report analyzing closures to purse seiners which indicates the very costly impacts from  the closure on the American Samoas economy and highlights the strong connection between  USAflagged  purse seine vessels and the broader American Samoa economy American Samoa noted it depends on USA flagged purse seiners for over 95 of the purse seine caught raw material supply needed by its canneries  When those vessels cannot fish in the high seas near American Samoa they must change their fishing  grounds While this has no true conservation benefit it does affect where the fishing vessels unload their  catch placing a significant conservation burden on American Samoa The loss of fish supply caused by  boats changing fishing grounds is compounded by the loss of supply resulting from boats changing from  USA flag to nonUSA flag in pursuit of increased fishing opportunities in the absence of FAD closure  exemptions and high seas limits and expectations of a less rigorous compliance regime
WCPFC17,332,Kiribati on behalf FFA members remarked on the importance of the tropical tuna measure and the  fact that all the key tropical tuna stocks managed by WCPFC are considered to be biologically healthy FFA  members observed that through successive tropical tuna measures the Commission is improving the  management of these fisheries that support economic development in Pacific SIDS and provide an important  source of food for the world Looking to 2021 and the development of the next tropical tuna measure FFA  members will focus on closing gaps in CMM 201801 particularly with respect to the setting of limits for  fishing on the high seas and ensuring that the rights of developing CCMs in particular SIDS to participate
WCPFC17,335,in high seas fisheries are given effect as envisaged in paragraphs 28 and 44 of CMM 201801 FFA members  stated they will continue to strengthen the management of tropical tuna fisheries within their EEZs and  emphasised their commitment to the Harvest Strategy workplan and the need to work towards agreed harvest  strategies for tropical tuna fisheries and to ensure that a revised tropical tuna measure helps in this effort
WCPFC17,336,China stated its view that a new tropical tuna CMM should be for three years and suggested that  the longline catch limit be returned to 2014 level while noting it was uncertain what the impact would be  on the tuna stock
WCPFC17,337,CNMI supported the principles behind the USA proposal notably the need to revise the bigeye  catch limits CNMI commented on the need for a transparent process to develop a tropical tuna measure  and advocated for a series of workshops in 2021
WCPFC17,338,Niue on behalf of FFA members recognised the need for a structured intersessional process in 2021  particularly in the latter part of the year to make progress before WCPFC18 and stated they would bring  forward specific proposals for consideration as part of this process They stated that SPC would need to be  tasked with supplying a range of analyses to support decision making particularly in relation to the impacts  of different management options in relation to overall management objectives With regards to the process  FFA members proposed that WCPFC hold a series of workshops in July and October 2021 to discuss  proposals relating to the tropical tuna measure The workshops would discuss proposals put forward by  CCMs and make progress towards a new CMM they suggested proposals would have to be accompanied  by a complete and accurate 201306 SIDS assessment if they were to be discussed and should be shared  with SIDS in advance to maximise the benefits of the process Should physical meetings prove viable a  sufficient budget should be allocated to ensure SIDS can attend FFA members noted their commitment to  cooperative engagement on these issues stated they would schedule regular bilateral discussions with CCMs  in 2021
WCPFC17,339,Guam supported the USAs  request for workshops leading up to an intersessional meeting and  noted the need for a more transparent process Guam stated that in the past it was an integral location for  tuna fisheries and that it looked forward to regaining that status
WCPFC17,340,The EU agreed on the need to undertake intensive intersessional work and stated that the earlier  this could start the better The EU noted COVID19 restrictions could require using electronic means to  initiate meetings but expressed the hope for an inperson meeting It reiterated its earlier recognition of  legitimate aspirations for domestic fisheries development and concerns with the broad use of openended  exemptions stating that it would aid discussions if exemptions could be clearly documented with clear  indications who would be entitled to use them their scale and time frames The EU also suggested CCMs  should have the ability to make requests to SPC for analysis of relevant issues
WCPFC17,341,Tokelau on behalf of PNA members stated it was supportive of the interests of American Samoa  in terms of access to the regions tuna resources stating they had worked with American Samoa previously  to meet that need and were prepared to do so again They noted their surprise that only a small proportion  of the catch by the United States fleet based in the region and vessels of the cannery owner is landed in  American Samoa and stated they would be happy to work with American Samoa to improve that outcome
WCPFC17,342,French Polynesia expressed its view that it was unlikely travel would be possible in 2021 and  supported holding a series of online workshops as soon as possible and noted that attention should be given  to FAD management including better marking monitoring and reporting of FADs whether through the  tropical tuna measure or a specific FAD CMM
WCPFC17,345,China suggested that the issue raised by the EU regarding the impact on fish stocks of nonSIDS  fleets chartered by SIDS could possibly be addressed through work by SPC
WCPFC17,346,RMI on behalf of the PNA members suggested using CMM 201801 as a starting point for a  process and stated that PNA members looked forward to reshaping the measure in ways that retain its  strength but fill existing gaps RMI noted that moving from flagbased limits to zonebased limits would  remove the need for exemptions and supported the FFA proposal for workshops to advance the process  PNA members stated they would develop proposals to contribute to the discussion on strengthening the  CMM
WCPFC17,347,7222 Longline bigeye catch limits  The Chair noted that despite paragraph 44 of CMM 201801 and due to the constraints of online  meetings the Commission would instead focus its attention on developing of a process to address the limit  and allocation issues in paragraph 44 the decision regarding that process is captured under Agenda Item  7224
WCPFC17,348,7223 Other commercial fisheries for bigeye skipjack and yellowfin  The Compliance Manager noted that the issue of paragraph 51 of CMM 201801 is addressed by  WCPFC172020DP04 and WCPFC172020DP05 regarding the availability of catch estimates from the  other commercial fisheries in Indonesia and Philippines respectively and there is also a TCC  recommendation in the 2020 Final Compliance Monitoring Report covering 2019 activities The two  delegation papers were circulated to SC16 and TCC16 but there was insufficient time in those virtual  meetings for detailed review TCC16 therefore recommended that the Commission task TCC17 and SC17  to review the papers to help facilitate a decision
WCPFC17,349,Australia on behalf of FFA members thanked Indonesia and the Philippines for their papers on the  application of paragraphs 50 and 51 of the tropical tuna measure FFA members welcomed the effort that  these CCMs have put into these papers to provide clarity on this important issue and acknowledged the  support of SPC on the issue FFA members supported the proposed approach
WCPFC17,350,The Commission noted that in recommending a  status  of  CMM  Review to paragraph 51 of  CMM 201801 TCC16 had recognized the difficulty of the application of this paragraph in terms of the  scope of other commercial fisheries in Indonesia and the Philippines
WCPFC17,351,The Commission noted that Indonesia and the Philippines had submitted delegation papers to  SC16 TCC16 and WCPFC17 WCPFC172020DP04 and WCPFC172020DP05 in response to the  request from TCC15 to inform a Commission discussion on the application of paragraph 51 of CMM  201801 However the virtual format of these meetings made it difficult to consider these papers at SC16  and TCC16
WCPFC17,352,The Commission agreed to task SC17 and TCC17 to review these papers and provide advice to  the Commission to facilitate a decision by WCPFC18 on the application of paragraph 51 of CMM 201801
WCPFC17,355,7224 New CMM for tropical tunas  The Chair referenced WCPFC17202015 Draft CMM 201801 RollOver The Commission
WCPFC17,356,discussed approaches to updating CMM 201801 and agreed to a simple rollover of the measure for 2021  taking into account the time and other constraints imposed by the virtual meeting protocol at WCPFC17  During their discussion CCMs agreed that all aspects of CMM 201801 that applied in 2020 should remain  in force in 2021 and that where CMM 201801 calls for completion of specific tasks by 2020 this should  be read through application of CMM 202001 as 2021
WCPFC17,357,The Chair outlined the discussions regarding a way forward to developing a new tropical tuna  measure in 2021 noting that CCMs had generally agreed that a series of virtual workshops would be held  chaired by the Commission Chair to which CMMs could submit proposals for discussion She reviewed the  divergent views expressed on the timing of the tropical tuna measure workshops and sought further input  from CCMs
WCPFC17,358,Korea supported holding the meetings in the first half of 2021 as the latter half of the year is  typically very busy with many meetings Korea suggested that if the tropical tuna measure meetings must  be held in the second half of 2021 the timing should be adjusted to avoid meeting in parallel with meetings  of other RFMOs
WCPFC17,359,The USA echoed Koreas intervention  that  the fall September December is busy for RFMOs  noting that some CCMsheads of delegations would attend several RFMO meetings The USA also  expressed concern about starting the tropical tuna measure meetings too late in the year and referenced the  outcome at IATTC which failed to provide adequate time to resolve outstanding issues and thus failed to  reach consensus at its 2020 annual meeting The USA noted the need to respectfully weigh and consider all  CCMs  views and encouraged Commission members to meet early in the year to enable full discussions
WCPFC17,360,Japan agreed with Korea and the USA in terms of the difficulties in coordinating the various RFMO  meetings and suggested the Commission recognize the varying situation of each member agree when  timing meetings to give consideration to avoiding conflict with other RFMO meetings as much as possible  and thus make small schedule changes if needed to avoid direct conflicts and recognize that if a CCM is  unable to fully participate in a meeting they will reserve the right to return to an issue at a later stage
WCPFC17,361,The EU agreed that 2021 would prove difficult because additional meetings would be held as a  result of the postponement of many meetings in 2021 The EU suggested that delaying intersessional work  until later in the year could make it more difficult to schedule while meetings held early in 2021 would  necessarily be virtual although this which would provide challenges for the EU in terms of the daily meeting  times The EU stressed that the work is very important and needs to be initiated during the first quarter of  2021
WCPFC17,362,The Cook Islands stated that virtual meetings do not provide a platform for side discussions which  are an important complement to plenary discussions It also referenced the need to allow time for bilateral  discussions and referenced FFA processes in which the 17 FFA members needed to determine their  collective positions stating that many of the FFAs timing considerations were based on the need for FFA  members to meet ahead of the WCPFC meetings
WCPFC17,363,FSM supported the comments by Cook Islands It stated that development of the tropical tuna  measure would involve balancing various issues and that discussions would be very challenging FSM  agreed that the timing was critical and noted that half of WCPFC CCMs are not members of other RFMOs
WCPFC17,366,It stated that the focus at WCPFC was on the WCPO and that CCMs needed to set aside the time to have  the necessary discussions
WCPFC17,367,The EU suggested the strawman approach previously used by WCPFC in developing the tropical
WCPFC17,368,tuna measure where key elements were listed and CCMs could provide their views and suggestions on  these options could be useful
WCPFC17,369,The USA acknowledged the comment by the FFA regarding timing and the logistics of dialog
WCPFC17,370,among FFA members and suggested as a compromise starting the meetings in April
WCPFC17,371,The Commission discussed how to determine what analyses to request from SPC The EU noted the
WCPFC17,372,difficulty CCMs would face in developing meaningful sciencebased proposals in the absence of support  from SPC and suggested the need to build consensus regarding the support different members might need  China commented regarding information requests to SPC and referenced the need for additional information  on specific issues that may not be typically addressed such as i the issues related to vessel charters raised  by the EU and ii issues raised by the USA with regard to EEZ and high seas fishing effort SPC stated it  would provide analyses as requested by CCMs but would ask that CCMs agree on the analyses they want  SPC to perform based on a realistic suite of options
WCPFC17,373,The Commission agreed on a simple rollover of CMM 201801 for one year and accordingly  adopted CMM 202001 Conservation and Management Measure for bigeye yellowfin and skipjack tuna  in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean Attachment F
WCPFC17,374,In terms of the process for developing the CMM 202101 Tropical Tuna Measure the  Commission agreed
WCPFC17,375,i to convene at least two weeklong workshops one to be held in April 2021 and another one  to be held in JuneJuly 2021 prior to WCPFC18 to discuss any proposals to develop a CMM  202101 tropical tuna measure All efforts would be made to avoid conflict of timing with  Pacific fisheries meetings and other RFMO meetings The workshops would be chaired by  the Chairperson of the Commission  ii that the tropical tuna measure should continue to support the pathway for the adoption of  harvest strategies in accordance with the work plan and indicative timeframes set out in the  Agreed Indicative Work Plan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 201406  To this end the first workshop would focus in particular on a discussion on the objectives  and scope of a new measure  iii that the first workshop would provide clarity on the information needed by the Commission  including the analyses required from the Scientific Services Provider SSP for a CMM  202101 on tropical tuna  iv that given the likelihood that some or all of these workshops would be virtual and given the  challenges already identified with this format it is essential for CCMs to engage  cooperatively in the intersessional period between workshops to provide the best possible  opportunity for a CMM 202101 on tropical tuna  v that proposals or other supporting papers to support discussions should be to the extent  possible submitted 30 days in advance of the date fixed for the opening of each workshop to  ensure all Members and the SSP have adequate time to review the information  48
WCPFC17,377,vi that the workshops would aim to discuss all proposals made by Members and make progress  towards CMM 202101 on tropical tuna Proposals must be accompanied by a 201306  SIDS and territories impact assessment asis required by CMM201306  vii If sufficient progress is made the Commission Chairperson with the assistance of the  Secretariat will prepare a draft CMM 202101 for discussion at WCPFC18 based on the  discussions atthe workshops withoutprejudiceto any Members right  to makeproposals to  WCPFC18
WCPFC17,378,viiithat any new CMM shall be fully consistent with the WCPF Convention in particular  Articles 10 and 30 of the Convention and CMM 201307 As part of the preparation for the  WCPFC workshops early consultation with all SIDS and participating territories is  encouraged taking into account the obligations reflected in CMM 201306
WCPFC17,379,ix that it was essential to avoid a situation in which the WCPFC had no tropical tuna CMM  73 South Pacific Albacore  731 Roadmap for effective conservation and management of South Pacific albacore  Fiji on behalf of the Chair of the South Pacific Albacore Roadmap IWG provided a summary of
WCPFC17,380,the 13 November 2020 meeting of the South Pacific Albacore Roadmap IWG referencing WCPFC172020 SPALBRoadmapIWG The IWG is considering amendments to the CMM or a new CMM which  will be a comprehensive measure to address all occurrence of the species in EEZs and the high seas and  including the entire area south of the equator including the IATTC Convention Area It also recognised  the need to address the TRP and improve monitoring of the southern longline fishery
WCPFC17,381,New Zealand on behalf of FFA members thanked the IWG Chair for convening the IWG despite
WCPFC17,382,the challenges in 2020 FFA members stated they are fully committed to the objectives and work of the IWG  and progressing the three key work streams identified by the IWG namely the setting of limits and  allocations for South Pacific albacore the achieving of the TRP and the development of a new CMM for  South Pacific albacore are all very important FFA members stated they look forward to cooperative  engagement with other CCMs for 2021
WCPFC17,383,New Caledonia stated it is highly dependent on South Pacific albacore both economically and in
WCPFC17,384,terms of selfsufficiency as this is a major source of protein for New Caledonia It noted it has developed a  sustainable approach to managing its South Pacific albacore fishery which comprises 65 to 70 of the  total tuna catch and is carried out by domestic vessels and local crews only It noted that decreasing yields  are affecting economic profitability and stated it supports to establishing a TRP in the near term New  Caledonia noted that as shown in WCPFC172020IP05 half the catch volume is in the high seas pocket  of the Convention Area and supported monitoring transhipment especially in the high seas
WCPFC17,385,Niue on behalf of FFA members reiterated that this is a critical fishery and prioritised improved
WCPFC17,386,management of the fishery by achieving the South Pacific albacore TRP on the agreed timing setting a total  allowable catcheffort and setting high seas limits In addition FFA members stated they are developing  management arrangements to apply within their collective EEZs based on agreed zonebased limits and  would inform the Commission accordingly
WCPFC17,389,China supported the work of the IWG and stated it would cooperate with CCMs to make progress
WCPFC17,391,French Polynesia stated that South Pacific albacore is a very important stock and comprises more
WCPFC17,392,than half its tuna catch and is important for food security particularly given the ongoing increase in  ciguatera It stated that its catch is exclusively from its EEZ and is sustainable but that French Polynesia is  surrounded by high seas areas and it is concerned about the high catch levels in those waters French  Polynesia is also located in the WCPFCIATTC overlap area and thus appreciates efforts to address the  stock on a Pacificwide basis French Polynesia stated its hope that the Commission could adopt the same  approach as will be used to develop the tropical tuna measure and that the issues could be progressed in  2021 through online workshops
WCPFC17,393,The EU acknowledged the efforts made by FFA to move the work forward noting its importance
WCPFC17,394,for SIDS and territories It stated that SC indicated that South Pacific albacore catch in the Eastern Pacific  Ocean had recently increased significantly and that a stock assessment is scheduled for 2021 The EU stated  it was important to include all available population dynamics in this work and suggested that could possibly  enable WCPFC and IATTC to have compatible measure
WCPFC17,395,Canada supported the roadmap and stated it would take part in any intersessional work in 2021
WCPFC17,396,France stated the stock is very important as highlighted by French Polynesia and New Caledonia
WCPFC17,398,Chinese Taipei stated that South Pacific albacore is very important to its fisheries and committed
WCPFC17,399,to working with the IWG Chair and CCMs on the management of the stock
WCPFC17,400,The Commission noted the report of progress from the SP Albacore Roadmap Working Group  WCPFC172020SPALBRoadmapIWG
WCPFC17,401,732 Review of CMM 201502 South Pacific albacore  The Chair noted WCPFC17202017 Reference Document for the Review of CMM 201502 and
WCPFC17,402,Development of Harvest Strategies under CMM 201406 South Pacific Albacore
WCPFC17,403,Samoa on behalf of FFA members noted they had called for revision of the measure over a number
WCPFC17,404,of years due to its ineffectiveness FFA members stated they would like a CMM with a clear direction on  setting limits particularly on the high seas and compatible with the inzone limits improved monitoring  and a commitment to achieve the TRP via an agreed trajectory including a requirement to transition  management to the harvest strategy when that work is completed FFA members stated they would be  contributing to work in the IWG
WCPFC17,405,American Samoa strongly supported revising CMM 201502 as soon as possible and referenced its
WCPFC17,406,fishery aspirations and economic development under Article 30 It looked forward to consultation with other  CCMs on the disproportionate burden American Samoa faces in this fishery a fishery with strong historical  significance to the people culture and economy of American Samoa It highlighted that similar to the USA flagged purse seiners operating out of its port its longline vessels are also in dire straits It stated that unless  CMM 201502 is revised to achieve the interim TRP for south Pacific Albacore in less than 20 years its  fleet and the indigenous fleets of other SIDS face a perilous future and that immediate action is needed to  ensure that its fleets have a future in the fishery
WCPFC17,409,The Commission noted that the review of CMM 201502 Conservation and Management  Measure for South Pacific Albacore is ongoing as part of the work of the SP Albacore Roadmap Working  Group
WCPFC17,410,74 Pacific bluefin tuna  741 Review of CMM 201902  The USA referenced the presentation by the ISC Chair under Agenda Item 71 and stated that  latest stock assessment indicates the spawning biomass is increasing and the stock is rebuilding It supported  the NCs recommendations for the CMM stating that this would support rebuilding the stock while enabling  greater management flexibility
WCPFC17,411,RMI on behalf of PNA members supported a 1year rollover of the CMM However they noted that  SB remained at less than 5 of SBF0 suggesting overfishing is continuing and suggested the fishery may  need to be limited or closed
WCPFC17,412,The EU support the rollover of the CMM and while recognizing the efforts of CCMs that are  involved in the fishery reminded the Commission that the stock was still at very low biomass levels and  under overfishing the EU stated that it hoped the recent slight increase in biomass would continue
WCPFC17,413,Japan supported the rollover of the CMM It noted that in 2020 the ISC conducted a new stock  assessment indicating a steady increase in spawning biomass more than expected when implementing the  rebuilding targets A proposal to increase the catch limit based on the harvest control rule HCR was  proposed but not adopted at NC16 mainly because of difficulties resulting from the virtual setting Japan  stressed that the difficulties faced by coastal fisherman were increasing every year noting that when they  cannot catch and must release bluefin tuna they must sometimes sacrifice other species These coastal  fishermen face increasing problems and Japan asked other CCMs to understand the situation Responding  to RMI and the EU Japan acknowledged that the stock status is below the WCPFC standard but stated that  the HCRs are based on the understanding that stock status is low and that these rules should allow for  increase in catch even though status is below the standard Japan asked CCMs to recall that the Commission  adopted HCRs that enable consideration of a catch increase Japan noted that the species migrates deeply  into the coastal waters and inquired how it could close the fisheries that catch bluefin tuna especially those  that use traps catching other fish as this would have a drastic impact on coastal fisheries
WCPFC17,414,PNG stated that it understands that the spawning stock biomass increase is in line with the rebuilding  target However it still considers the level to be quite low and supported a rollover of the CMM to see that  additional rebuilding does occur
WCPFC17,415,Korea supported a 1year rollover of the CMM It stated it would welcome discussion regarding  revision of the measure and possible increase of the total allowable catch based on best available science  and management advice
WCPFC17,416,The Commission adopted CMM 202002 Conservation and Management Measure for Pacific  Bluefin Tuna Attachment G
WCPFC17,419,75 North Pacific striped marlin  751 Interim Rebuilding Plan  The USA noted that WCPFC16 adopted an interim rebuilding plan for North Pacific striped marlin  WCPFC16 Summary Report Attachment L and that ISC provided no advice to WCPFC in 2020 on North  Pacific striped marlin The USAs Consultative  Draft  Proposal  on a CMM  for  North  Pacific  striped marlin  WCPFC172020DP08 notes that stock assessments conducted in 2015 and 2019 continued to find the  stock to be overfished and experiencing overfishing The USA stated its consultative draft CMM for North  Pacific was designed to ensure that the interim rebuilding target is met according to the specifications of the  interim rebuilding plan adopted in 2019 The USA also stated its understanding that some CCMs may be  hesitant to discuss revision of the North Pacific striped marlin proposal at WCPFC17 and asked CCMs to  consider the consultative draft revised CMM as a basis for intersessional consultations with the aim of  adopting a revised CMM at WCPFC18 The USA also noted some discrepancies between ISC stock  assessment catch estimates of striped marlin in the Convention Area north of the equator and WCPFC catch  estimates for that area by CCM and stated it was working with SPC to improve the WCPFC estimates and  better understand reasons for the differences The USA proposed that WCPFC17 task SPC to examine the  differences between the ISC stock assessment catch estimates of striped marlin in the Convention Area north  of the equator and the WCPFC catch estimates for that area by CMM and provide an assessment to SC17  of any shortcomings in or notable uncertainties associated with the WCPFC estimates with the aim of  allowing CCMs to improve their estimates where appropriate
WCPFC17,420,FSM on behalf of FFA members stated that in discussions at WCPFC16 two Commission members  Japan and USA clarified that striped marlin in the North Pacific is not designated as a northern stock but  is managed by WCPFC FFA members stated that the correct terminology to be used when referring to this  stock is striped marlin in the North Pacific and notNorth Pacific striped marlin
WCPFC17,422,Korea stated that North Pacific striped marlin is a bycatch species for many CCMs including Korea  and noted it is very concerned about the stocks status and supported work to reconcile differences and  uncertainties in catch estimates between ISC and WCPFC It looked forward to working with the USA on  the issue in 2021
WCPFC17,423,The EU stated it appreciated the efforts and leadership of the USA in addressing this important  issue which is pending since 2010 when the Commission first expressed its concerns for the stock which  had been assessed to be in a very poor conservation status since 2011 The latest assessment indicated again  that the stock was overfished and subject to overfishing and that under recent recruitment catches needed  to be reduced to 60 of the catch quota in CMM 201001 to achieve a 60 probability of rebuilding to  20SSBF0 by 2022 The EU stated it understands that the stock assessment was affected by several  uncertainties and data conflicts there was uncertainty in the catch amounts in the beginning of the series in  the level of gillnet catches and in life history parameters such as growth which significantly impacted the  assessment results In addition there was a retrospective pattern suggesting that the projections might have  been too optimistic Given this context the EU stated the need to improve if possible the model and the  data inputs used in the assessment The EU fully agreed with the USA proposal to task SPC to examine the  differences between ISC and WCPFC catch estimates and to provide an assessment on the uncertainties  However the EU stated that for this stock it would be central to assess the potential of catch limits to achieve  mortality reductions that is noting the bycatch nature of most of the catches catch limits might result in  lower landings but not in a reduction of fishing mortality if it is offset by a higher level of dead discards  Therefore the EU recommended that SPC also be tasked with an assessment of the potential for mortality  reductions through estimations of atvessel mortality and postrelease survival and that ISC be tasked to  develop a roadmap to address the issues identified in the latest stock assessment with special emphasis on
WCPFC17,426,revisiting the growth estimates the reconstruction of catch time series and model development Despite  these technical limitations the EU supported the intersessional work that should allow development of a  CMM for WCPFC17 and called on CCMs involved in the fisheries that harvest North Pacific striped marlin  to contribute to this endeavour While supporting the USA proposal to task ISC SPC SC and TCC to  provide advice for the development of the CMM the EU asked that it be clarified what each of these bodies  should be doing and ensure the appropriate sequence and timing of these tasks to avoid losing more time
WCPFC17,427,Chinese Taipei agreed on the need to strengthen management of North Pacific striped marlin to  rebuild the stock It noted the importance of accurate catch estimates and supported close communication  between ISC and SPC to resolve the catch estimate discrepancies Regarding the rebuilding plan it supported  the approach of intersessional consultations Chinese Taipei stated its understanding that the intent is to  improve the existing CMM 201001 and stated that the new plan should be based on the existing CMM  when considering catch reduction It stated any revised CMM should be reviewed by SC
WCPFC17,428,RMI on behalf of FFA members stated they supported the rebuilding plan for this stock at  WCPFC16 and had considered the draft consultative proposal submitted by the USA It noted the following  concerns
WCPFC17,429,the proposal is based on flagbased limits and it is a longstanding FFA position that it does not  support flagbased limits that cover the EEZs especially if they are based on flagbased catch  history in their waters This proposal removes SIDS exemptions and is encroaching on the  sovereign rights of SIDs who are responsible for managing stocks within their EEZs    in terms of Article 30 of the Convention and Article 25 of the UNFSA SIDS need to have access  to the high seas and this proposal severely limits SIDS access to the high seas    WCPFC lacks an effective longline monitoring regime for the high seas and is therefore unable to  monitor flagbased catch limits effectively Until such time that there is a robust high seas  monitoring regime with integrity in place it will be difficult to enforce this CMM Robust  monitoring includes electronic monitoring a catch documentation scheme with independent  verification and robust port inspections and transhipment regimes and    the CMM201306 assessment attached with the proposal is unsatisfactory as the USA failed to  consult with SIDS to understand the true implications of the proposal on SIDS This is a  significant fishery for FFA members north of the equator and the proposal may have significant  implications for them and their management of this species Unfortunately no FFA members were  consulted in compliance with the requirements of CMM 201306  For these reasons FFA members stated they did not support the proposal while noting their commitment to  ensuring that this stock is rebuilt FFA members stated they would continue to work constructively with  CCMs to improve bycatch management and mitigation for the stock including considerations of live release  and removal of shallow set hooks In this respect FFA members hoped to develop a more appropriate CMM  that takes into account SIDS needs aspirations and sovereignty and ensure that the stock of striped marlin  in the North Pacific is rebuilt
WCPFC17,430,Japan thanked the USA and agreed that all CCMs have the obligation to use this stock sustainably  It noted that the interim rebuilding plan stated the rebuilding objective would be subject to revision at  WCPFC17 Japan stated that until the early 1990s Japan operated 500 vessels that used 5060 kmlong drift  nets per vessel most of which targeted squid but some of which also targeted billfish This fishery ended  as a result of a UN moratorium but the ISC stock assessment indicates that following the end of this fishery  fishing mortality increased and biomass decreased Japan has queried ISC as to possible causes and ISC is
WCPFC17,433,studying the issue Japan stated it would be very difficult to consider amendments to the CMM until this  issue had been resolved Japan also noted the need for a review of the science underlying the conclusions in  WCPFC172020DP08and asked thatthe USAsscientistsshare theirdata with  ISC if the latter approved  the conclusions these could then be sent to the WCPFC Japan noted this process should take place before  WCPFC considers an amendment to the CMM It summarized that to consider the USA paper it would  require the underlying scientific evidence and justification which it hoped could be provided to ISC in 2021
WCPFC17,434,Palau on behalf of PNA members thanked the USA for providing a consultative draft proposal to  strengthen CMM 201001 but did not support the approach in the draft noting that as FFA members had  also stated the PNA did not support current flagbased catch limits it stated these should be replaced with  a system of zonebased management arrangements which include allocations by zones without regard to  flag and arrangements for high seas fishing that provide fair opportunities for CCMs to participate in high  seas fisheries This approach would remove the need for the current SIDS exemption Palau stated that  improvements are also needed to the monitoring and verification of any catch limits that are implemented  PNA members stated that moving striped marlin management in the direction of zonebased management  would take time In the meantime given the urgent need for stronger measures to reduce fishing mortality  PNA members suggested that the Commission look at alternative measures to reduce targeting of striped  marlin in the North Pacific such as nonretention PNA members encouraged the USA to look to developing  its proposal in that direction
WCPFC17,435,The EU again noted with concern the stocks very poor conservation status It stated that many  CCMs were advocating broad principles but stressed CCMs  responsibility to rebuild the stock with some  urgency The EU noted that the USA proposal suggested tasks for SPC TCC SC and ISC and encouraged  CCMs to support this work
WCPFC17,436,Recalling the comment by FSM on behalf of FFA members the USA noted that the use of the term  North Pacific striped marlin  was in no way intended to suggest that the stock is not managed by the  Commission as a whole It agreed on the need for significant work and suggested that SC be requested to  resolve some of the outstanding issue It noted that the stock is overfished and that all CCMs are responsible  for rebuilding the stock It noted that it had put forward a consultative draft proposal and looked forward to  intersessional discussions The USA stated it realizes that discussion was needed in ISC and SC and that  additional scientific discussion would help inform the Commissions options It noted that live release may  be helpful and suggested that tasking ISC and SPC could be helpful The USA stated that the Commission  needs to take action and asked CCMs to commit to action
WCPFC17,437,The Ocean Foundation on behalf of The Pew Charitable Trusts Sustainable Fisheries Partnership  and WWF thanked the USA for its consultative draft proposal to rebuild North Pacific striped marlin They  stated that although this stock is often described as abycatch species WCPFCs mandate requiresmanaging  this stock just as strongly as it manages targeted tunas and that North Pacific striped marlin has significant  ecological importance as well as considerable value for commercial and recreational fisheries This stock  has been overfished continuously since the early 1990s and experienced overfishing during most of that  period relative to MSY reference points They encouraged all members with an interest in this stock to  collaborate with a view to agreeing at WCPFC18 on a measure that rebuilds this stock in accordance with  the target and timeline agreed last year Precautionary management of billfish should include setting and  enforcing sciencebased catch limits and implementing additional protections that include measures to  mitigate catch and minimize mortality when striped marlin are encountered These strategies should be  tested ideally via Management Strategy Evaluation and put in place via a fully specified harvest strategy  to ensure they will achieve the rebuilding target and timeline and maintain sustainability once secured The  stock is just one of several billfish and swordfish stocks that deserves greater attention from managers and
WCPFC17,440,they urged CCMs to consider in 2021 how to follow the advice of the SC to improve the management of  this stock as well as Southwest Pacific swordfish and Southwest Pacific striped marlin
WCPFC17,441,RMI stated that its concern regarding the reference to ISC stock assessment catch estimates by CCM
WCPFC17,442,and WCPFC catch estimates noting the RMI is a member of the WCPFC in the North Pacific but is not a  member of the NC or the ISC and does not look to them for stock assessments relying instead on the  WCPFC SSP SPCOFP
WCPFC17,443,The EU stated that despite a willingness to progress the scientific work the significant efforts by
WCPFC17,444,the USA to propose a more ambitious way forward to address the very dire status of the stock had largely  come to naught The EU stated that the outcome fell short of its expectations but more importantly of the  Commissions obligations to take due consideration of the very poor status of the stock The EU stated its  hope that in 2021 CCMs could resume the work needed to develop a framework to allow rebuilding of the  stock The EU expressed the hope that the outcome at WCPFC17 would prove useful but stated it was  definitely inadequate given the very poor conservation status of this stock
WCPFC17,445,The USA stated it would continue seek to make progress by working intersessionally in 2021
WCPFC17,447,i examine differences between ISC stock assessment catch estimates by CCM and WCPFC  catch estimates and work with the Scientific Services Provider to provide an assessment of  the shortcomings  ii provide explanation why the striped marlin stock decreased and the fishing mortality  increased after a drastic decrease in fishing effort by high seas driftnet fisheries in the early  1990s and  iii develop a roadmap to address the issues identified in the latest stock assessment by ISC  AGENDA ITEM 8   HARVEST STRATEGY
WCPFC17,448,81 Review of Indicative Work Plan  At the request of the Chair Dr James Larcombe Australia presented a summary of the Indicative
WCPFC17,449,Work Plan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies Under CMM 201406 WCPFC17202020 noting the  actions for 20202022 as contained in pages 8 to 10 of the working paper He stated that the technical and  management strategy evaluation MSE work being conducted by SPC is proceeding well noting progress  with regard to the candidate harvest control rule HCR designs for both skipjack and South Pacific  albacore communication of MSE results for decision makers calculation of performance indicators for the  skipjack monitoring strategy uncertainties included in the skipjack and South Pacific albacore MSE  framework and a range of other technical work However SC16 could not discuss most of the work in detail  because of its very limited virtual meeting and he observed that the same was likely to be true at WCPFC17  He also noted much remains to be done in terms of CCM capacity building In summary Dr Larcombe  stated that there had been delays in some very important areas meaning it was likely the overall schedule  would not be met
WCPFC17,452,Korea stated it generally supported the revised workplan and expressed its hope that the  Commission would be able to make more progress on the harvest strategy work in 2021 and that Korea  would do what it could to progress the work
WCPFC17,453,Kiribati on behalf of FFA members noted WCPFC17202020 and emphasized their commitment  to the successful implementation of the Harvest Strategy Workplan and stated that they were encouraged  by the plans particular focus on the need for more time and more work on the multispecies framework for  all tuna species which they stated is critical They also noted the recognition of the need for more time to  build capacity particularly for SIDS on understanding how harvest strategies function and their  implications FFA members stated they would continue to encourage a focus on the capacity building  workshops that will assist CCMs particularly SIDS to participate fully in this complex process and thereby  increase confidence in the harvest strategy development process and its outcomes when implemented
WCPFC17,454,PNG stated it understanding that the work is quite substantive noted the complexity for multispecies  is challenging and called for capacity building including on a virtual basis for CCMs including PNG to  enable full participation
WCPFC17,455,The EU agreed that harvest strategy issues are complex and that capacity building for all CCMs is  needed to enable them to fully engage observing that this was one reason they had supported a science  management dialogue The EU stated that given the complexity of the process and the need to ensure it is  conclusive it is important that there is an opportunity for CCM scientists to engage with SPC  intersessionally in the same way that they participate in the prestock assessment workshops and  encouraged that such a process be adopted for the harvest strategy work
WCPFC17,456,Japan agreed regarding the complexity and the need for capacity building for all CCMs Japan stated  that based on its experience in other RFMOs communication between scientists and managers is very  important Japan inquired whether SPC had an updated plan for holding capacity building workshops  whether inperson or virtually It also agreed with the EU that a more inclusive process should be established  to increase cooperation between SPC and CCM scientists when doing stock assessments and other analyses  and asked SPC to consider how to establish such a process Japan also noted its concern regarding adopting  a staggered schedule for skipjack bigeye and yellowfin under a multispecies approach as this would not  enable taking into account complex multispecies issues especially in the purse seine fishery Dr Larcombe  noted Japans comment  about  staggering some harvest  strategy development  specifically addressing  skipjack before bigeye and yellowfin He observed that this illustrated why the multispecies framework is  so important as it could enable all CCMs to have an understanding of what the management system looks  like and the implications for the four main tuna species Japan noted that it would be happy to see a staggered  approach as long as the harvest strategy would be applied jointly to skipjack bigeye and yellowfin as was  confirmed by the Chair at WCPFC16
WCPFC17,457,China stated its support in principle for the workplan and stated that it hoped WCPFC would be  able to establish a harvest strategy in 2022 It noted that capacity building was important for all CCMs to  help establish a dialog between scientists and managers
WCPFC17,458,New Zealand stated it remained committed to progressing the important work on harvest strategies  to ensure sciencebased management of the four primary tuna species It acknowledged the need for ongoing  capacity building by SPC to enable CCMs particularly SIDS to fully participate in this process  Despite delays as a result of COVID19 good progress has been made on South Pacific albacore with  management procedures for both scheduled to be agreed by 2022 It noted that ultimately the Commission  needs to develop a multispecies approach to harvest strategies this will be complex work New Zealand  stressed the collective interest of members in making progress on harvest strategies in order to drive best
WCPFC17,461,practice fisheries management and be recognised for our sustainable fisheries including through Marine  Stewardship Council certification
WCPFC17,462,France acknowledged the complexity of the issues and the need to ensure full participation by all
WCPFC17,464,SPC stated it would be working to provide capacity building to all CCMs that requested it hopefully
WCPFC17,465,through facetoface meetings but stated it was also developing online approaches Regarding transparency  with respect  to SPCs work it noted that its work on albacore was being reviewed by a wellknown expert  and stated there was a request from SC to hold an intersessional technical working group in 2021
WCPFC17,466,The Commission adopted the updated Indicative Workplan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies  under CMM 201406 Attachment H
WCPFC17,467,82 ScienceManagement Dialogue  The Chair referenced WCPFC17202021 ScienceManagement Dialogue which she noted
WCPFC17,468,reviews prior Commission efforts to develop a ScienceManagement Dialogue and resubmits WCPFC152018 20 Key Decisions For Managers and Scientists Under the Harvest Strategy Approach For WCPO  Tuna Stocks And Fisheries and WCPFC15201821 Terms of Reference for the ScienceManagement  Dialogue She stated that SC16 indicated a strong preference for such a dialog and observed that there was  no discussion on the issue in the WCPFC17 ODF
WCPFC17,469,Tonga on behalf of FFA members noted the importance of the dialogues in expediting the
WCPFC17,470,development of the harvest strategies but stated the dialogue would be best served when all CCMs agree  on what the dialogue requires of members ie when there are agreed TORs FFA members stated that if  circumstances permit physical WCPFC meetings in 2020 those meetings will be extremely timechallenged  due to the backlog of work from 2020 due to the pandemic and further extending those meetings to  accommodate the sciencemanagement dialogue may not be feasible However should SC17 be a virtual  meeting FFA members stated their openness to the idea of holding a trial  run  of  the dialogue immediately  after SC17 for FFA members to get the benefit of additional capacity building which could be the focus  They welcomed the views of other CCMs
WCPFC17,471,PNG on behalf of PNA members supported the FFA statement and stated they had been prepared
WCPFC17,472,to support a sciencemanagement dialogue on a trial basis to be held after SC However capacity building  activities planned for 2020 were disrupted by COVID19 and PNA members stated they were not ready to  participate in what seemed likely to be a virtual sciencemanagement dialogue in 2021 especially given the  work needed on the revision of the tropical tuna measure
WCPFC17,473,French Polynesia thanked Australia for its comprehensive overview of the harvest strategy status
WCPFC17,474,under Agenda Item 81 and noted in particular its comments on the need for capacity building In that  context the sciencemanagement dialog would be a good way to enable progress on the harvest strategy  work French Polynesia supported convening a sciencemanagement dialog and stated it is flexible as to its  scheduling
WCPFC17,475,The USA stated it is open to and interested in establishing the sciencemanagement dialogue It
WCPFC17,476,recalled the management options workshops which essentially served as a precursor to the dialogue The  USA also recalled that in 2018 there was good agreement on the sciencemanagement dialogue TORs but  that CCMs were unable to agree on the timing whether the dialogue should be held in association with SC
WCPFC17,479,or with the Commission meeting The USA suggested that the situation in 2021 would be different if  meetings in particular SC would be held virtually and that holding SC virtually would remove the obstacle  for the USA to holding the sciencemanagement dialogue meeting in conjunction with SC or another agreed  upon time as there would be no cost implications However the USA also noted that the tropical tuna  measure discussions were a higher priority for the Commission in 2021 and acknowledged the difficulties  the Commission would face in finding time for both The USA closed by stating it was flexible as to how  the sciencemanagement dialogue is addressed in 2021
WCPFC17,480,Nauru on behalf of FFA members stated that their concern with having the sciencemanagement  dialogue meeting in conjunction with WCPFC related to the fact that delegations come to the Commission  with their national positions already determined Having the sciencemanagement dialogue immediately  after the SC meeting in their view would enable use of updated knowledge from SC to discuss the science  and the management applications and could help shape recommendations or discussions for decision  making at the following Commission meeting
WCPFC17,481,PNG on behalf of PNA members supported the FFA member statement that having a science  management dialogue associated with the Commission meeting would not allow for constructive dialogue  as delegations arrive there with their national positions already determined whereas a meeting held  immediately before the Commission does not provide time for delegations to reflect on and take into account  the discussions prior to the Commission meeting They stated that a meeting associated with SC would be  better to inform the managers
WCPFC17,482,Chinese Taipei supported holding the sciencemanagement dialogue If the meeting would be held  physically Chinese Taipei stated it should be prior to the Commission meeting to facilitate the involvement  of a greater number of managers However if it is a virtual meeting Chinese Taipei stated it was flexible as  to the timing
WCPFC17,483,The EU stated the sciencemanagement dialogue is important and needed and also supported  holding it in conjunction with the Commission meeting if it is a physical meeting and stated it was flexible  on the timing if the meeting was held virtually
WCPFC17,485,RMI supported holding the sciencemanagement dialogue in conjunction with the SC meeting In  response to the comments from the USA it stated that the prior management options workshop process was  useless as CCMs arrived with their positions known and established and that to then go into discussions  on those issues had no benefit It emphasized the need to engage on the scientific issues and agreed that  COVID19 has slowed capacity building efforts which could make holding a sciencemanagement  dialogue even on a trial basis impossible in 2021
WCPFC17,486,Ocean Foundation also on behalf of The Pew Charitable Trusts Sustainable Fisheries  Partnership ISSF the IPNLF and WWF observed that it had been six years since WCPFC committed itself  to developing harvest strategies for key stocks or fisheries and these discussions actually began prior to the  adoption of CMM 201406 They stated that as 2020 has demonstrated there isaneed to shock proofthese  fisheries to ensure management decisions can happen even during disruptive events like the one caused by  COVID19 They also noted that the experience of IATTC offers a cautionary story as IATTC ended its  2020 annual meeting without agreeing on a tropical tuna measure leaving no international management in  place and stated that this is another example of the value of harvest strategies because they would set up  more predictable clearly defined rules for fishing Despite some initial progress and productive discussions
WCPFC17,489,in the WCPFC over the years they expressed concern that momentum for developing and agreeing harvest  strategies has stalled as illustrated by the following
WCPFC17,490,The WCPFC has yet to agree on a fullytested harvest strategy for any of its tuna species    The Scientific Committee at SC14 15 and 16 recommended creating a sciencemanager dialogue  working group Harvest strategy work requires frank and open discussions between scientists and  managers A busy plenary meeting whether inperson or virtual is not conducive to progressing  these discussions    A dialogue group could ease some of the difficult negotiations anticipated over the next year They  stated they were encouraged by some flexibility over the floor and a 2021 virtual meeting could be  used as a trial run and allow for greater participation  They further noted that the Secretariat had introduced a document that presents a clear path forward for  establishing a dialogue group They stated their understanding of the constraints of WCPFC17s virtual  format but urged members to seize the opportunity to create the sciencemanagement dialogue working  group without any further delay noting that another year of inaction would send the wrong message about
WCPFC17,491,the Commissions intent  to undertake  this work which  is  fundamentally  about  ensuring the future  sustainability of its fisheries They stated this also has implications for the industry and publicprivate efforts  via international ecolabels such as the Marine Stewardship Council Standard program with fisheries in  the region relying on the Commission to move forward with this work to maintain their certifications
WCPFC17,492,The Chair observed that in 2018 the only issue that CCMs failed to resolve regarding the science
WCPFC17,493,management dialogue was the timing and noted that the issue remained unresolved She stated that CCMs  were open to holding a virtual sciencemanagement dialogue meeting in conjunction with a virtual SC17  but that many CCMs were concerned that this may not be viable She suggested that the Commission seek  to progress the sciencemanagement dialogue in 2021
WCPFC17,494,The Commission acknowledged the utility of a sciencemanagement dialogue in progressing the  implementation of the Indicative Workplan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies but was unable to agree  on the staging of such a dialogue The Commission agreed to continue to explore in 2021 options to  convene a sciencemanagement dialogue
WCPFC17,495,AGENDA ITEM 9 REPORTS FROM SUBSIDIARY BODIES AND WORKING  GROUPS
WCPFC17,496,The reports of the subsidiary bodies were taken as read by the Chair and were not presented to the
WCPFC17,497,Commission However recommendations of subsidiary bodies not addressed under other agenda items were  considered under this agenda item
WCPFC17,499,The SC Chair Ueta Faasili  Jnr referred the Commission to WCPFC172020SC16 SC15
WCPFC17,500,Summary Report and WCPFC17202022 Reference Document on other recommendations from SC16 for  Agenda Item 91 He noted that the following recommendations required consideration by the Commission  endorsement of the 20212025 Shark Research Plan adoption of the proposed work programme and budget  for SC and endorsement of recommendations relating to publication of annual catch and effort estimate  tables and the hosting of the SC17 and SC18 meetings
WCPFC17,503,Tuvalu on behalf of PNA members stated that some PNA members were disadvantaged at times
WCPFC17,504,in participating in the virtual SC16 session but appreciated the effort that went into ensuring that the core  business of the Committee was addressed PNA members stated that the invitation to the Commission in  paragraph 90 of the Summary Report Executive Summary to hold an intersessional scientific technical  workshop to provide feedback to SPC on technical issues relating to the development of the harvest strategy  framework was not supported by PNA members at SC16 and was not supported at WCPFC17 because of  their concerns about their effective participation PNA members supported the adoption of the Harvest  Strategy Workplan on the basis that the activities in the workplan could be undertaken within the existing  Commission structure and schedule without additional bodies or meetings and that they continue to hold  that view PNA members also requested that SC and SPC develop a screening process to ensure that vessel related research activities within the SC Workplan are undertaken with vessels that are complying with  Commission measures stating that in their view it was important to ensure that Commission funds are not  used for activities involving vessels that fail to comply with Commission measures
WCPFC17,505,The Commission endorsed the 20212025 Shark Research Plan SC16 Summary Report  paragraph 261
WCPFC17,506,The Commission approved the SC16 proposed work programme and budget for 2021 and  indicative budgets for 2022 and 2023
WCPFC17,507,The Commission endorsed the SC16 recommendation that the approach of publishing the ACE  tables based on the April 30 Scientific Data submissions and subsequent updates and revisions from  CCMs is continued SC16 Summary Report paragraph 296
WCPFC17,508,The Commission adopted the SC16 Summary Report WCPFC172020SC16 with some  CCMs expressed reservations regarding paragraph 255d in the SC16 Summary Report
WCPFC17,510,The Chair referred the Commission to WCPFC172020NC16 NC16 Summary Report
WCPFC17,511,The NC Chair Masanori  Miyahara reviewed NC16s recommendation regarding  Pacific bluefin  tuna and noted that NC and IATTC would hold the 6th Joint IATTC and WCPFCNC Working Group  Meeting on the Management of Pacific Bluefin Tuna tentatively in July 2021 hosted by Japan and that  Japan had also offered to host NC17 if an inperson meeting was feasible tentatively in September
WCPFC17,512,Fiji on behalf of FFA members supported the recommendations made by NC16 thanked Japan for  its offer to host NC17 and looked forward to participating in the meeting FFA members also noted the  officers recommended by NC16 for further terms as Chair and Vice Chair and supported those  recommendations
WCPFC17,515,The Chair referred the Commission to WCPFC172020TCC16 TCC16 Summary Report and
WCPFC17,516,WCPFC17202023 Reference Document on other recommendations from TCC16 for Agenda Items 93  and 94
WCPFC17,520,The Chair referred to WCPFC17202023 paragraph 2 i Review of North Pacific albacore  CMM
WCPFC17,521,TCC16 noted for WCPFC17 that there were recommendations in the Provisional CMR relating to  the revision of existing Conservation and Management Measures TCC16 recommends that  WCPFC17 consider approaches to address challenges identified for the following obligations  noting that more information related to these recommendations is contained in the Provisional  CMR
WCPFC17,522,a CMM 200503 04 for North Pacific albacore annual catch and effort reporting TCC16  Summary Report para 89  FSM on behalf of FFA members supported TCCsrecommendation  for WCPFC17 to provide clear  approaches to address challenges identified in assessing compliance with the North Pacific Albacore CMM  noting TCC had previously raised issues with the ambiguity of language  used such as  fishing for or  directed at in some CMMs including this measure
WCPFC17,523,Improvements to the tracking of observer report requests and responses in order to better identify  impediments to the flow of observer reports
WCPFC17,524,With respect to the recommendation for ROP providers to provide a succinct summary of relevant  information in observer reports associated with cases in the compliance case file system CCFS to help  assess whether a possible violations has occurred FSM on behalf of FFA members stated that ROP  providers should not be asked to judge on whether an offence has been committed this should be done by  trained compliance staff who have a good understanding of their own legal frameworks
WCPFC17,526,The Chair referred to WCPFC17202023 paragraph 2 ix Treatment of Crew on Fishing Vessels
WCPFC17,527,xi TCC16 recommended consideration by WCPFC17 regarding the treatment of crew on fishing  vessels and to further strengthen the provisions for observer safety  Indonesia referenced its earlier remarks on WCPFC172020DP09 made under Agenda Item 4  and suggested that because the meeting format at WCPFC17 prevented indepth discussion that the  Commission hold an intersessional working group during 2021 prior to WCPFC18 Indonesia stated it  would be pleased to lead the work along with a cochair from among the FFA members
WCPFC17,528,China expressed its respect and sympathy to laborers referred to by Indonesia in DP09 China  recalled its statement under Agenda Item 4 that it did not support the proposal on establishing a binding  measure on labour standards for crew on fishing vessels or establishment of an intersessional working group  as suggested by FFA It stated that Indonesias proposal was incomplete as it lacked CMM 201306 criteria  for assessment while seeming to add a number of unreasonable obligations for CCM which were  impossible to discuss at WCPFC17 China further offered a position statement on labour standards for crew  noting the following
WCPFC17,529,The Fisheries Authority of China attaches great importance to crew safety and protection and  supports WCPFC giving due attention to the issue  61
WCPFC17,531,Labour safety and protection should be the responsibility of the relevant authorities and the relevant  issues should be resolved by the relevant authorities through domestic legislation bilateral  consultation or discussion in the relevant international organizations In fact the ILO and IMO  already have relevant rules and China has some domestic law and regulations    Crew employment is a commercial activity and should be conducted under the management of  relevant international rules and domestic laws and in accordance with commercial contracts  Violators shall be held liable in accordance with the abovementioned international rules domestic  law and contracts but they shall not exceed the existing international rules and shall not bear  unreasonable obligations    WCPFC is a tuna RFMO not an organization to deal with labour issues which are very complicated  The fishery sector should focus on resource conservation and management otherwise the main duty  of the organization will be affected China also stated that WCPFC lacks a mandate to deal with  labour issues in a compulsory manner based on the WCPFC Convention Chinas delegation has no  authorization to agree to any compulsory decision by the Commission on labour issues    Some delegations may argue that FAO Code of Conduct on responsible fisheries can be a basis to  allow WCPFC to deal with the labour issue China agrees the FAO Code of Conduct can be a basis  for WCPFC to deal with labour issue on a voluntary basis and the Commission adopted a Resolution  on labour standards in 2018 but the code of conduct cannot be used to justify a compulsory CMM    China did not agree to establish an intersessional working group because terms of reference had not  been established These must be clearly defined If the mandate of the IWG is to develop a non mandatory resolution for labour standard for crew on fishing vessels by means of strengthening the  existing resolution China stated it would actively support and participate in the discussion in the  IWG    China also stated that there were various labour issues that deserved study and proposed a 1year  independent study to support further consideration of the issue in 2021  The EU thanked Indonesia for raising the issue and noting its importance stated that the EU would  be happy to engage intersessionally The EU stated consistency with ILO and IMO requirements and  mandates was essential
WCPFC17,532,France thanked Indonesia for the proposal and stated that France supports improvement in labour  standards and would be supportive of intersessional work tackling legal issues and working with the IMO  and ILO
WCPFC17,533,New Zealand thanked Indonesia for the proposal and stated it is appropriate and essential that  WCPFC consider crew safety The safety and conditions of fishing vessel crew are critical to the reputation  of the Commission and its members that reputation will be undermined by cases of human rights abuse in  the Convention Area New Zealand acknowledged that other organisations also have responsibilities in this  respect but that does not preclude the WCPFC taking responsibility for the safety of crew on fishing vessels  in this region Under the Convention the WCPFC has a mandate to adopt minimum standards for the  responsible conduct of fishing operations In New Zealands view eliminating the most  egregious  abuses  of human rights against fishing vessel crews is clearly within the purview of establishing standards for the  responsible conduct of fishing operations New Zealand supported an intersessional process and  acknowledged the suggestion by China to undertake a study and suggested this could be usefully included  in the intersessional process
WCPFC17,534,The Philippines stated it supports the discussion on the improvement of labour standards and  volunteered to join the IWG
WCPFC17,537,The USA stated that the issue was long overdue to be discussed It noted that fishing involves gear  and people and the Commission has CMMs regarding gear type and it was time to consider the fishers  The USA observed it is difficult to separate the gear from the humans who are operating it The USA further  observed that vessels using forced labour puts others at a significant disadvantage from a financial  standpoint but that the most important aspect was the human rights issues associated with forced labour  The USA noted the need for a robust discussion on labour standards which can be subjective and the need  to enforce labour contracts and other arrangements as also referenced by China The USA looked forward  to robust discussion on labour issues in 2021
WCPFC17,538,Korea recognized the importance of the issue and thank Indonesia for submitting the proposal It  looked forward to working with Indonesia and other CCMs through an IWG or other means as appropriate
WCPFC17,539,RMI supported Indonesias  proposal It noted that FFA has agreed minimum terms and conditions  in relation to crew employment in the region independent of WCPFC It noted that RMI aspires to have its  citizens crewing on ships and involved in the industry and supported additional work on the safety of  observers and fishers
WCPFC17,540,French Polynesia supported the proposal by Indonesia and joined the support expressed by other  CCMs It stated that is of a high importance in its own fleet and that French Polynesia has had regulations  in place since 2013
WCPFC17,541,New Caledonia fully supported the proposed intersessional discussion
WCPFC17,542,FSM echoed the support for the effort proposed by Indonesia and stated that this is an important  matter for FSM noting issues of social responsibility and stewardship FSM suggested the type of study  suggested by China could be part of the work proposed for the IWG Given the importance FSM suggested  the IMO and ILO could be invited to be part of the process
WCPFC17,543,China reiterated that if an IWG was established it would require TORs and suggested referring to  international work  or a workshop and welcomed inclusion of its proposed study and involvement of  officials from IMO and ILO China also suggested the need for possibly involving an independent  consultant
WCPFC17,544,Japan acknowledged the issues are very complex Japan stated that its fishing agency does not  necessarily address all issues covered by Indonesia in DP09 It suggested calling the intersessional work a  process if  that  was  acceptable to CCMs but  noted that  clarifications were still  needed in terms of  what  this involved and what the project suggested by China would entail
WCPFC17,545,The Chair suggested that CCMs begin through an information sharing process and if needed invite  experts She further suggested that the Commission agree that intersessional work be led by Indonesia and  an FFA member with all interested parties to collaborate to facilitate the work
WCPFC17,546,Chinese Taipei thanked Indonesia for the proposal that gave special attention to this issue It  supported the intersessional process and that this work be led by cochairs who could facilitate information  collection and sharing so that CCMs might share with each other experiences and difficulties regarding the  implementation of relevant measures in the process and so that there will be more robust materials for the  discussions next year
WCPFC17,547,Indonesia thanked CCMs for the support and China for the suggested study It stated it would consult  with the Chair to map out the work for 2021
WCPFC17,550,The Chair stated that the intersessional arrangement would be established by Indonesia and the FFA  colead and intersessional discussion would take place virtually
WCPFC17,551,Human Rights at Sea HRS referenced WCPFC172020OP06 Draft Proposal for Model WCPFC  Conservation and Management Measure on Human Rights and Labour Rights Protections for Fisheries  Observers  Safety  Security  and WellBeing WCPFC172020OP17 Information Statement on CMM 201306  addressing potential burdens andor requirements imposed on Small Island Developing States SIDS as  a result of the proposed HRAS Model WCPFC CMM for Fisheries Observers the Commissions  previous  and ongoing work in respect of CMM 201703 on the Protection of WCPFC Regional Observer Programme  Observers and Resolution 201801 on Labour Standards for Crew On Fishing Vessels HRS highlighted  the various issues addressed in its report and suggested that CCMs i consider and accept the proposed  model CMM for detailed consideration by CCMs during 2021 and ii give due consideration to  fundamental human rights standards and protections across all applicable CMMs HRS asserted that there  is no reason in international law including established human rights and labour rights law that State  obligations cannot be applied at sea equally as they are on land stating that this naturally means that the  protection of and respect for human rights at sea for all workers including crew and observers must be  addressed by WCPFC in terms of revised and new policy implementation backed by CCM State legislation  as applicable
WCPFC17,552,Korea Federation for Environmental Movements KFEM on behalf of Environmental Justice  Foundation the IPNLF the Association of Professional Observers and WWF supported the proposal  provided by Indonesia as well as HRSs statement  and the statements made by all delegations in support of  a WCPFC process regarding providing protection for fishing vessel crew members It reported that on April  26 2020 Advocates for Public Interest Law APIL interviewed Indonesian crews on a Chinese flagged  fishing vessel Longxing 629 quarantined at Busan port in South Korea who reported multiple incidents of  abuses of labour and health working conditions they were subjected to working on the vessel KFEM stated  that at WCPFC16 there was also the reported case of more than 90 Indonesian workers abandoned in Apia  without pay who were also working on Chinese longline vessels KFEM stated that the Longxing 629 case  illustrates why WCPFC needs to establish protection measures for the fishers onboard The close  relationship between IUU fishing and human rights abuse at sea is evident KFEM addressed the already  established international legal instruments that mandate the obligation to protect human rights at sea noting  the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural  Rights and the resultant i obligations to respect protectand fulfilthe realization offishery workershuman  rights ii right to just and favourable conditions of work including the right to a living wage the right to  rest and the right to reasonable working hours and iii right to adequate safe and hygienic conditions  adequate food and drinking water and safe working conditions However they noted that different  regulations in each country allow human traffickers and exploiters to evade legal repercussions KFEM  therefore urged WCPFC to protect the human rights of fishing crew members stating that IUU fishing and  human rights abuse at sea transcend national borders and call for regional measures and strongly urged the  Commission to protect the human rights of fishing crew members
WCPFC17,554,The Commission endorsed the TCC16 recommendation in paragraph 101 of the TCC16  Summary Report and tasked the Scientific Services Provider with reviewing the feasibility of expanding  the ACE tables to include
WCPFC17,557,i additional estimates of effort where it is practicable to be derived based on the April 30  scientific data submissions from CCMs and provide an update to SC17 and  ii estimates of annual areabased CMM quantitative limits where it is practicable for the  estimate to be derived based on the April 30 scientific data submissions from CCMs and to  provide an update to TCC17  Improving the online Compliance Case File System CCFS
WCPFC17,558,The Commission endorsed the TCC16 recommendation in paragraph 118 of the TCC16  Summary Report and tasked the Secretariat to prioritise in its work planning for 2021 to
WCPFC17,559,i undertake the ten actions identified in Table 1 of the Review Report Attachment I to  enhance the CCFS to automatically notify people within the CCM when a single case is  created or updated make the CCFS easier to use allow CCMs to browse a single list  containing all cases enhance the aggregated summary tables produced by the CCFS  improve communication with CCMs regarding which internet browsers the CCFS works  best on improve the CCFS quick guide and offer CCFS training to CCMs  ii undertake the one action contained in Table 1 of the Review Report Attachment I to  implement a proof of concept online graph  table creation tool for CCFS data and  iii to provide an update to TCC17 on the progress on the implementation of the proposed CCFS  enhancements  Improvements to the tracking of observer report requests and responses in order to better identify
WCPFC17,561,The Commission endorsed the TCC16 recommendation in paragraph 178 of the TCC16  Summary Report and tasked the Secretariat to provide a paper for TCC17 that outlines the feasibility and  costs of further developing the CCFS such that it has the ability to 1 serve as a messaging tool through  which CCMs can request observer reports and ROP Providers can respond to requests and 2 keep track  of such requests and responses In particular it should be developed so that to the extent possible
WCPFC17,562,i requests and responses for observer reports are tied to specific cases in the CCFS but also  can include requests and responses related to investigations of possible violations other than  those identified in the CCFS  ii from the perspective of the Secretariat the messaging and tracking functions are automated  and do not increase the ongoing workload of Secretariat staff  iii it can handle bulk requests for observer reports and responses to bulk requests ie multiple  cases provided that sufficient details are included by the requesting CCM  The Commission endorsed the TCC16 recommendation in paragraph 179 of the TCC16  Summary Report and agreed that once the CCFSs messaging tool is fully functional  and the Secretariat  has successfully trialled it with a subset of CCMs for a period of three months all requests for observer  reports and all  responses  tosuch requests should be sentthrough the CCFSs messaging toolsothey can  be tracked
WCPFC17,565,Methods  to filter  out  false positive and de minimis  violations  to  reduce  the  number of observer  report requests and the associated workloads for ROP Providers and CCMs
WCPFC17,566,The Commission endorsed the TCC16 recommendation in paragraph 180 of the TCC16  Summary Report and agreed that  the expectations  under  the  ROP Minimum  Standards  on  Briefing and  Debriefing  and  The PreNotification Process  be  revised  as  shown in TCC16 Summary  Report  Attachment  F such that  any time a YES is noted  on the Observer  Trip Monitoring Summary eg  Form Gen3 with respect to a WCPFC obligation indicating a possible violation the ROP Provider is  expected to prioritize debriefing of the observer and not transmit the prenotification to the Secretariat  until
WCPFC17,567,i debriefing of the observer has been completed and the information in the observer report has  been finalized accordingly and  ii the observer or ROP Provider includes comments on the Observer Trip Monitoring  Summary that  givesufficient  detailasto why the YES wasnoted referencesto other  parts
WCPFC17,568,of the observer report that contain information relevant to the possible violation and where  relevant an indication of the magnitude of reporting discrepancies or the number of  instances of the possible violation
WCPFC17,569,The revised ROP Minimum Standards as amended by WCPFC17 is provided in Attachment J
WCPFC17,570,The Commission endorsed the TCC16 recommendation in paragraph 181 of the TCC16  Summary Report and requested that ROP Providers be requested to review observer reports associated  with cases in the CCFS that are generated by queries by the Secretariat of the ROP database to help  assess  whether  the possible violationsidentified through the Secretariats screening is supported by the  information in the observer  report and to provide in the CCM comments  box for  the consideration of  the relevant CCMs a succinct summary of the relevant information in the observer report
WCPFC17,571,The Commission noted the TCC16 recommendation in paragraph 182 of the TCC16 Summary  Report that the Commission possibly through work of the ROP IWG review the minimum data fields  associated with the Observer Trip Monitoring Summary and make updates to those data fields to better  reflect  the Commissions priorities and the types of violations that  are amenable to yesno indications by  the observer Any such recommendations should take into account their implications eg on observers  workloads in terms of ROP Providers having to revise their forms etc
WCPFC17,573,The Commission agreed that the minimum pennant size for use by the boarding vessel transiting  from the inspection vessel be 44 centimeters cm by 66 cm height by length Inspection flag usage  and display for the inspection vessel itself would not change from what was agreed at WCPFC4 This  decision only updates information on pennant dimensions contained in Attachment G Annex 2 of TCC3  that was adopted at WCPFC4
WCPFC17,575,The Commission noted that the TCC Workplan 20192021 adopted at WCPFC15 continues until  2021 and endorsed the TCC16 recommendation that the TCC ViceChair continue progressing  intersessional work on the TCC workplan for consideration by TCC17 and WCPFC18 in 2021

WCPFC17,580,The Commission agreed to intersessional work to be led by CoLeads Indonesia and an FFA  Member through various means to promote discussion among members and enable the sharing of  information with initial discussion points to be developed in consultation with the Commission Chair  and the Secretariat
WCPFC17,582,94 Intersessional Working Groups  941 EReporting and EMonitoring Working Group ERandEMWG  Kerry Smith Australia Chair of the ERandEMWG referenced WCPFC20202020ERandEMWG4  Final ERandEMWG4 Summary Report stating that the ERandEMWG agreed that more  work was needed with a draft CMM on Electronic Monitoring EM to be finalized early in 2021 She noted  the need to work closely with the transhipment IWG
WCPFC17,583,Kiribati on behalf of FFA members acknowledged efforts of the Chair of the ERandEMWG to  progress the EM and ER work given its complexity and technical nature FFA members reiterated their  views with regards to EM as stated in WCPFC172020DP01 specifically that decisions regarding EM at  the Commission level should not result in the transfer of disproportionate burden to SIDS and territories  and monitoring is a complementary tool to human observers FFA members noted that WCPFC15 agreed to  prioritise EM in areas where independent data collection and verification is currently low SC Project 93 has  highlighted where these areas are in the longline fishery and primarily on the high seas and stated high  seas transhipment is also a priority area FFA members are progressing the issue of ER and EM through  initiatives such as i adoption of a FFA Regional Longline Fisheries Electronic Monitoring Policy in June  2020 as a guide for FFA members in support of the development of their national EM programme and ii  commitment to progressively adopting ER for fishing vessels operating within FFA members  EEZs and  the high seas with a view to achieving 100 adoption by 2022 noting the need to cater for special  circumstances of small domestic vessels operating solely within EEZs FFA members stated they would  seek to establish compatible measures for ER in the high seas as well and would seek to bring a proposal  to WCPFC18 FFA members stated their support for continuation of the work of the ERandEMWG in 2021
WCPFC17,584,Korea addressed the statement by FFA members noting the following in regard to the issues raised  in WCPFC172020DP01
WCPFC17,585,Korea will consult with FFA members and others regarding the definition of disproportionate  burden  so it can effectively discuss this issue in the future    where no human observers can be deployed EM should be used as an independent tool to monitor  or collect scientific information    the Commission should apply the ERandEM standards throughout the Convention Area once  developed and    longline vessels operate throughout the Convention Area and vessels can fish in both EEZs and the  high seas in a single trip if EEZs are treated separately from the high seas it can complicate the  operation of the ERandEM process  67
WCPFC17,587,The EU supported the comments by Korea stating that although it makes sense to prioritize areas  with low coverage a lesson from the pandemic for the purse seine fleet is that having EM systems can  compensate for loss of observer data as has occurred in 2020 The EU stated that consideration should be  given to the usefulness of implementing EM across all fleets and throughout the Convention Area
WCPFC17,588,China looked forward to participating in the working group in 2021 It agreed with the EU and  Korea that ER and EM should be applied as matter of principle to all WCPFC fisheries while noting that  priority should be given to the longline fishery
WCPFC17,589,Pew on behalf of the Ocean Foundation Birdlife International WWF ISSF KFEM Sustainable  Fisheries Partnership and the Association of Professional Observers stated that although they had hoped  for more progress agreement among CCMs on the goals and objectives of the EM Observer Program is  vital to ensure that design and implementation of the system is successful in the future They stated that a  robust yet flexible EM system will allow the Commission to complement its current observer program and  ensure that the necessary data will always be collected even in challenging times such as the present They  urged CCMs to commit to further discussions in 2021 that will move towards agreement on a set of clear  standards and an implementation plan and continue that work that has made the Commission a leader among  the RFMOs
WCPFC17,590,The EU thanked the Secretariat for having undertaken intersessional work regarding the FLUX  standard noting that it would continue discussions to identify how this exploratory work could be continued  in 2021 and looked forward to developing specific suggestions in 2021 and finding resources to undertake  the work
WCPFC17,591,The Commission noted the intersessional progress report by the ERandEMWG WCPFC172020 ERandEMWG4

WCPFC17,593,Tokelau on behalf of FFA members acknowledged that the views and comments of FADMOIWG  participants had been accurately summarized in the report FFA members reiterated their view expressed in  the report that they have reservations about the participation in the joint tuna RFMO Working Group on  FADS JWG as they consider that recommendation 1 of the report from the 2nd JWG is not relevant to the  WCPFC FFA members supported the suggestion by the FADMOIWG that the review of the revised  guidelines for nonentangling and biodegradable FADs drafted by the FADMOIWG be undertaken by  SC17 and TCC 17
WCPFC17,594,EU expressed regret that FFA members did not support WCPFC participation in the JWG and asked  that FFA members reconsider this position
WCPFC17,595,Kiribati on behalf of PNA members supported the FFA statement and supported adoption by the  Commission of the proposal that SC17 and TCC17 be tasked to review the draft guidelines on non entangling and biodegradable FADs
WCPFC17,598,France stated that FAD management involves a number of technical issues and that involvement in  the JWG could be very useful and supported WCPFC involvement
WCPFC17,599,French Polynesia stated that the FADMOIWG had produced worthwhile outcomes and had  developed a good working dynamic It noted the need to ensure that the issue of worsening marine pollution  is addressed and sought to have a clear idea of the next steps to address it
WCPFC17,600,Tuvalu on behalf of PNA members stated they continued to support the position expressed by PNA  and FFA Members at previous Commission meetings on collaboration with the JWG noting that PNA  members were working to develop high standards of FAD management in the tropical WCPO area and that  their experience was that participation in global dialogues on FADs resulted in pressure for lower standards  in the WCPO designed to assist FADdependent fleets at the expense of bigeye and other bycatch stocks  PNA members stated they did not support WCPFC participation in the JWG
WCPFC17,601,The USA acknowledged that in many respects the WCPFC is ahead of others on FAD management  and suggested that CCMs and PNA members in particular had much to offer other nations while noting  that some RFMOs may have learned certain lessons and also have good ideas For those reasons the USA  stated it continues to support regular participation by WCPFC in the JWG
WCPFC17,602,The Commission considered the following suggested tasking for the FADMOIWG in 2021  proposed by the EU
WCPFC17,603,Define minimum standards for data collection including buoy data by vessel operators    Continue work in the development of guidelines for nonentangling and biodegradable FADs as  called for in paragraph 22 of CMM 201801 and explore additional measures to reduce the impact  of abandoned and lost FADs on the ecosystem    Explore consistency and harmonization to the extent possible in FADrelated definitions and  measures with IATTC    Explores the development of a FAD and buoy marking system    Assess the convenience of establishing mandatory or voluntary protocols for the transmission of  highresolution buoy position and echosounder data for scientific research and    Foster the involvement of the industry and fishermen in future meetings of the FADMOIWG and  subsidiary bodies eg SC  Japan stated that the proposed tasking contained some technical issues that would require additional  consideration and discussion beyond what was possible at WCPFC17
WCPFC17,604,The EU commented that the suggestions which emerged from the FADMOIWG had been  discussed for some time and encouraged that more work on specific issues be undertaken
WCPFC17,605,The USA supported the comment by the EU stating that the text was not controversial It observed  that FADs could be considered a violation of MARPOL as they are not composed of natural materials and  often become discarded The USA stated that there are hundreds of thousands of FADs deployed and that  vessel owners were also aware of the need to address issues with FADs The USA encouraged CCMs to  support further work on the issues
WCPFC17,606,RMI agreed with the need for intersessional work and stated that on that basis it had supported  having FSM lead the FADMOIWG work RMI stated it would support continuing work regarding advice  on nonentangling and biodegradable FADs but agreed with Japan on the need to have time to consider  other issues in part because of the extensive work already facing the Commission in 2021
WCPFC17,609,French Polynesia encouraged that the other issues suggested by the EU also be captured for the  record and encouraged adopting language to the effect that the FADMOIWG would also address these
WCPFC17,610,PNG referred CCMs to the bolded outcomes in the FADMOIWG Summary Report WCPFC172020 FADMOIWG401 and suggested that the language be adopted
WCPFC17,611,The Commission noted the Report of the FAD Management Options IWG and accepted its  recommendations to continue to engage intersessionally to progress outstanding work WCPFC172020FADMgmtOptions
WCPFC17,613,The Commission noted that the FAD Management Options IWG had prepared a revised set of  draft guidelines for nonentangling and biodegradable FADs as reflected in the FADMOIWG042020 WP02 Attachment K
WCPFC17,614,Noting that the SC16 and TCC16 could not complete the task in paragraph 22 of CMM 201801  due to the limited agenda resulting from COVID19 the Commission tasked SC17 and TCC17 to review  the draft guidelines for nonentangling and biodegradable FADs prepared by the FAD Management  Options IWG Attachment K The FAD Management Options IWG should revisit the draft guidelines  based on input from those bodies as well as any additional scientific and technical information on non entangling and biodegradable FADs
WCPFC17,615,943 VMS Data Gap Review  Mr Terry Boone USA coChair of the VMSSWG referenced WCPFC172020VMSSWG  VMS SWG Report to WCPFC17 and noted the need for more time to complete the work of the SWG and  requested that the Commission endorse the continuation of  the SWGs work in 2021 to develop  recommendations  for  TCC17s consideration to address  VMSdata gapsand improve the number  ofvessels  reporting to the Commission VMS
WCPFC17,616,Tuvalu on behalf of FFA members supported the TCC16 recommendation that WCPFC17 task the  VMS SWG to consider approaches to address challenges identified for the CMM 201402 paragraph 9a  and the VMS SSP 28 obligations FFA members stated they supported the TCC16 recommendation that  WCPFC17 continue the work of the VMSSWG in 2021 and develop recommendations for  TCC17s  consideration to address VMS data gaps and improve the number of vessels reporting to the Commission  VMS

WCPFC17,622,they remain committed to the review of the transhipment CMM to ensure a framework is in place to better  manage transhipment activities in the high seas of the Convention Area Given the importance of the work  they urged the work be expedited in 2021 FFA members registered concern with the proposed removal of  Annual Report Part 2 in the latest version of the Scope of Work as one of the sources of information for the  study noting the Annual Report Part 2 is valuable and the main source of information where CCMs report  on an annual basis on how they have implemented CMM 200906 They suggested the Annual Report Part  2 be used as one of the sources of information in the review FFA members also urged that the Scope of  Work for analysis of transhipment information be finalized so that the work can start sought an update on  concerns raised at TCC16 regarding the effective monitoring of high seas transhipment and the difficulty in  deploying observers in the review of CMM 200906 and how this is intended to be taken up by the IWG  sought an update on the additional funding needed to complete the analysis of transhipment information  phase 1 3 and supported TCC16s  recommendation that WCPFC17 reaffirm its tasking of the  TranshipmentIWG to continue and complete its work
WCPFC17,623,Dr Alex Kahl USA CoChair of the TranshipmentIWG thanked Cook Islands for nominating a  new CoChair He noted the importance of the work of the IWG was underscored by the absence of observers  in 2020 He noted the recently posted Transhipment IWG report WCPFC172020TSIWG and stated  his hope that agreement could be reached soon within weeks on the scope of work He provided an update  regarding the funding being provided for the study by the USA indicating that the voluntary contribution  would be used for phases 1 and 2 of the study while additional funding would be required for phase 3  which would not be required until the second quarter of 2021 He stated that pending consultations with his  new CoChair he hoped to have an intersessional virtual meeting regarding CMM revisions in the absence  of observers probably relying on EM and ER which would be a priority in 2021 He stated he anticipated  WCPFC18 would receive a recommendation from the IWG on the issue
WCPFC17,624,Pew on behalf of the Ocean Foundation WWF ISSF KFEM and the Association of Professional  Observer observed that the pandemic demonstrated the urgent need  to  strengthen  all  of  the Commissions  oversight tools especially those for transhipment which is a key link in the supply chain for several of the  regions fisheries but  if  left  unmonitored can become  a conduit  for  IUU  fishing and other  crimes  They  stated that the transhipment CMM is well overdue for a review and that they are encouraged that there is  now a clear plan on how such an analysis will proceed and urged all parties to commit to the schedule and  to secure the necessary funding They looked forward to further discussion of the findings over the next  year
WCPFC17,625,The Commission noted the intersessional progress report by the Review of the Transhipment  CMM IWG WCPFC172020TSIWG
WCPFC17,626,The Commission also acknowledged the intention of the TranshipmentIWG to finalise in early  2021 the draft Scope of Work for the analysis of transhipment information to support the review of the  Transhipment Measure CMM 200906 through the TranshipmentIWG during the intersessional period  in 2021

WCPFC17,631,FSM on behalf of FFA members reiterated that it is imperative that the purpose and the key  principles of the CMS that it is effective efficient fair and work towards compliance are upheld to ensure  that no CCMs misuse the CMS to serve their own individual interests doing otherwise undermines the  process CCMs collectively worked to strengthen over several years and calls into question the integrity of  the scheme FFA members noted that the specific issue they were referencing was found in the public  domain in paper WCPFC172020IP04 Table 2 which shows that a particular CCM has clearly gone over  its high seas purse seine effort limit in 2019 FFA members stated that the CCM had done the same  exceeded its limit in past years and was assessed accordingly with a Priority NonCompliant status as  shown in the 2019 Final CMR FFA members argued that the approach that was used at WCPFC16 and  previously should be used in 2020 but that they did not understand why this was not done as it undermines  the effective operation of the CMS that they consider essential to the effective implementation of the  Commissions management framework  FFA members stated that if this obligation is not assessed it sets a  dangerous precedent and that there is a need to avoid the perception that the Commission accepts that any  CCM may unilaterally interpret and develop legislation in direct conflict with measures adopted in good  faith FFA members sought an explanation from any CCM that does not agree to the consistent interpretation  and application of this obligation to explain what is different in 2020
WCPFC17,632,The Commission noted the TCC16 recommendation in paragraph 19 of the Final Compliance  Monitoring Report and encouraged CCMs to work closely with the Secretariat to ensure that new  information submitted in revised Annual Report Part 1 after the reports have been provided to the CCMs  as outlined in paragraph 25 of CMM 201906 is brought to the Secretariats attention for  inclusion in the  draft CMR where relevant and in line with paragraph 27 of the same measure
WCPFC17,633,The Commission tasked TCC17 to provide WCPFC18 an update on obligations and other matters  which would benefit from further consideration by the Commission to assist in assessing compliance and  noted that these concerns may also emerge through the Future Work of the CMS on Audit Points

WCPFC17,635,102 List of obligations to be reviewed by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme in 2021  Mr Mat Kertesz Australia Chair of the List of Obligations SWG provided a summary of the  SWG outcomes He noted that the SWG had reached consensus on all but one issue following extensive  discussions He indicated that WCPFC16 tasked TCC16 to recommend a revised list of obligations to be  assessed in 2021 but that TCC16 was not able to agree a list The SWG used the FFA proposal on a list of  obligations WCPFC172020DP01Attachment 1 as the basis for developing a new list for adoption  SWG participants expressed divergent views on the appropriate length of the list of obligations for  assessment in 2021 A majority of CCMs expressed a view that the list should be no longer than the list  assessed in 2020 while some CCMs expressed that the length of the list should not be limited to 2020 levels  All participants recognised the importance of ensuring that the list of obligations is manageable given the
WCPFC17,638,broad range of issues that TCC17 will need to address in 2021 including developing and implementing a  process to consider aggregated summary tables required under paragraph 26ii of CMM 201906 ongoing  work to develop the CMS and providing advice related to the development of a new tropical tuna measure  The Chair of the List of Obligations SWG outlined the report of the SWG as follows
WCPFC17,639,i The SWG agreed on the following in light of the impacts of the COVID19 pandemic    not  to include  assessment  of  the Intersessional  Decisions in response  to COVID19 in the CMR  process in 2021    to include the obligations suspended by the Intersessional  Decisions in response to  COVID19  for review in the 2021 CMR for the periods prior to their suspension noting the importance of these  obligations and the duration of their applicable periods    not to include CMM 201805 Annex C paragraph 6 related to longline observer coverage   the  SWG noted that the impacts of the COVID pandemic meant that it was highly unlikely that the  CMR would be able to effectively assess this obligation for the year 2020 The SWG expressed that  the decision not to include this obligation does not represent a suspension of this obligation rather  this is a recognition of the genuine impact that the COVID19 pandemic will have on the ability of  the TCC to assess this obligation The SWG noted that the decision not to assess this obligation  does not remove CCMs obligation to comply with this provision    not to include paragraph 13 of CMM 201803 as this obligation is reliant on observer information  ii The SWG additionally agreed    not  to include  the comprehensive sharks measure  CMM  201904 in the list of obligations for  assessment in 2021 noting that this measure only came into effect on 1 November 2020 and hence  the period of application for 2020 was only two months The SWG also noted that the superseded  sharks measure CMM 201007 was included in the list    not to include obligations related to CMM 201104 Oceanic whitetip sharks and CMM 201308  Silky sharks noting that these measures have been reviewed consistently over the last three years  and CCMs noncompliance has been low  iii However in recognition of the importance of these measures the SWG also made several  recommendations to the Commission regarding their inclusion in the list of obligations for 2022  The SWG has insufficient time to fully consider a recommendation related to a shortened timeframe  for CCMs Annual Report  Part  2 submissions
WCPFC17,641,The EU addressed the SWG recommendation not to include the obligations related to oceanic  whitetip and silky sharks and questioned whether the actual level of noncompliance was low and stated  that the retention ban was not implemented by all CCMs The EU stated that this recommendation to not  assess compliance with these CMMs was not in accord with the spirit and intent of the CMS adopted by the  Commission and encouraged that these CMMs be included in the list to be approved for review of  compliance
WCPFC17,642,The SWG Chair stated that while the SWG had held an extensive discussion on shark species and  related obligations it did not discuss specifics on compliance with these obligations
WCPFC17,643,RMI supported the list as proposed and stated that PNA members were concerned with increasing  the number of obligations on the list and could agree to it for 2021 on the basis that it did not establish a  precedent to increase the list in the future
WCPFC17,647,The EU agreed to support the consensus on the basis that its views would be reflected in the report  The EU further reflected that FFA members had previously expressed strong concerns regarding these  species and stated that the views expressed at WCPFC17 seemed to conflict with their previous interest in  the species conservation
WCPFC17,648,The ComplianceManager  addressedthe proposed deadline for  CCMsAnnualReport  Part  2 of 100  days prior to TCC17 She referenced WCPFCTCC16202020 Preliminary Consideration of Anticipated  Forecast of Secretariat Work Commitments for TCC in 202122 and outlined the significant work the  Commission would have to undertake in 2021 much of it related to TCC In recognition of that work and  to enable the Secretariat to fully support the work of the Commission the Compliance Manager encouraged  that CCMs support the recommendation regarding earlier submission by midJune of the Annual Report  Part 2 in 2021
WCPFC17,649,The Commission adopted the report of the List of Obligations SWG and noted that
WCPFC17,650,i WCPFC16 had tasked TCC16 to recommend a revised list of obligations to be assessed in  2021 but that TCC16 was not able to agree to a list  ii The SWG used the FFA proposal on a list of obligations WCPFC172020DP01  Attachment 1 as the basis for developing a new list of obligations for 2021 assessments  iii SWG participants had expressed divergent views on the appropriate length of the list of  obligations for assessment in 2021 A majority of CCMs expressed a view that the list should  be no longer than the list assessed in 2020 Some CCMs expressed that the length of the list  should not be limited to 2020 levels All participants recognised the importance of ensuring  that the list of obligations is manageable given the broad range of issues that TCC17 will  need to address in 2021 including developing and implementing a process to consider  aggregated summary tables required under paragraph 26ii of CMM 201906 ongoing  Future Work to develop the CMS and providing advice related to the development of CMM  202101 tropical tuna measure  iv The SWG recognised the impacts of COVID19 on the operation of the WCPO tuna fishery  and on the operation of the Commission and the SWG agreed not to include assessment of  the Intersessional Decisions in response to COVID19 in the CMR process in 2021  v The SWG agreed to include the obligations  suspended by  the Intersessional  Decisions  in  response to COVID19 for  review in the 2021 CMR for  the periods prior  to their  suspension noting the importance of these obligations and the duration of their applicable  periods  vi The SWG agreed not to include CMM 201805 Ann C 06 related to longline observer  coverage   the SWG noted that the impacts of the COVID pandemic meant that it was  highly unlikely that the CMR would be able to effectively assess this obligation for the year  2020 The SWG expressed that the decision not to include this obligation does not represent  a suspension of this obligation rather this is a recognition of the genuine impact that the  COVID19 pandemic will have on the ability of the TCC to assess this obligation The SWG  noted that  the decision not  to assess this obligation does  not  remove CCMs  obligation to
WCPFC17,654,vii The SWG  agreed not  to include  the comprehensive  sharks measure  CMM  201904 in  the list of obligations for assessment in 2021 noting that this measure only came into effect  on 1 November 2020 and hence the period of application for 2020 was only two months  The SWG also noted that the superseded sharks measure CMM 201007 was included in  the list  viiiThe SWG recommended that obligations under CMM 201904 including measures related  to nonretention of silky sharks and oceanic whitetip sharks and paragraph 13 of CMM  201803 be included in the list of obligations for assessment in 2022
WCPFC17,655,The Commission agreed to the List of Obligations to be reviewed by the Compliance Monitoring  Scheme in 2021 covering 2020 activities Attachment M

WCPFC17,658,Australia on behalf of FFA members reiterated that it is imperative that the key principles and  purpose of the CMS are upheld to ensure that no CCMs misuse the CMS to serve their own individual  interests or to undermine the integrity of the scheme FFA members called on the Commission to  collectively address several fundamental issues in order to secure the delivery of outcomes that the CMS is  specifically designed and intended to meet and supported recommendations from TCC16 in WCPFC172020 25 especially those relating to streamlining of annual reporting including the trial of ACE tables  improving the online Compliance Case File System and continuation of CMSIWG to progress the CMS  future work tasks in 2021 FFA members also welcomed and supported TCC16s recommendation for  Ms  Heather Ward from New Zealand to lead the riskbased assessment framework and Ms Rhea Moss Christian from Marshall Islands to lead the audit point work They stated their understanding these leads  would take charge in progressing these areas and report directly to TCC on the results FFA members stated  their intent to make a dedicated effort in 2021 towards the CMS future work in particular the development  of audit points and riskbased assessment framework
WCPFC17,659,The Commission noted the progress on the Future Work of the CMS tasks through the CMS  IWG established by WCPFC16 under the leadership of the TCC ViceChair and as set out in paragraph  4 of WCPFC17202025
WCPFC17,660,The Commission noted in paragraph 129 of the TCC16 Summary Report that TCC16 had  affirmed the importance of all the future work called for in section IX of CMM 201906 and supported  the prioritisation of four streams of intersessional work for the CMS IWG in 202021 and recognised that  some elements may extend until 2022
WCPFC17,661,i the development of a riskbased assessment framework to inform compliance assessments  and ensure obligations are meeting the objectives of the Commission  75
WCPFC17,663,ii the development of audit points to clarify the Commission obligations assessed under the  CMS as well as a checklist to be used by proponents of any proposal to include a list of  potential audit points for the consideration of the Commission  iii the development of a process for TCC to consider the aggregated tables alongside the draft  CMR paragraph 33 and 34 of CMM 201906 and  iv the development of guidance on the participation of observers in the CMS process as  outlined in CMM 201906  The Commission endorsed the TCC16 recommendation in paragraph 130 of the TCC16  Summary Report that Ms Heather Ward from New Zealand would lead the riskbased assessment  framework task and Ms Rhea MossChristian from Marshall Islands would lead the development of audit  points in support of the CMS IWG Chair
WCPFC17,664,WCPFC17 also noted the delay in advancing the work agreed at WCPFC16 concerning the  aggregated tables and tasked the TCC Chair to lead work intersessionally prior to TCC17 with a view to  providing guidance on how TCC17 would consider the aggregated tables alongside the draft CMR This  work will also benefit from the TCC16 recommended analytical work that the Secretariat will be  undertaking related to the CCFS and approaches to present the data
WCPFC17,666,The Chair introduced WCPFC17202026 WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2021 which presented for  the consideration of WCPFC17 the relevant information for a decision on the 2021 WCPFC IUU Vessel  List in accordance with CMM 201907
WCPFC17,667,RMI stated its appreciation to Korea and all CCMs for their valuable contributions since TCC16 in  terms of placing a vessel on the IUU list RMI referenced a joint letter from RMI and Korea Circular  2020140 of 4th December 2020 agreeing to remove the ORYONG No 721 from the provisional IUU list  Regarding Koreas flag state responsibility as outlined to TCC RMI stated it was pleased to report that  Korea had demonstrated its cooperation willingness and due diligence and that RMI was satisfied It stated  it had no further issues and requested that the provisional listing of the ORYONG No 721 be withdrawn
WCPFC17,668,Korea thanked RMI for their cooperation provided to settle the issue by mutual agreement and  appreciated the CCMs that provided useful advice on the issue Korea reiterated that it has no tolerance for  IUU fishing activities and would work with all CCMs to realize an IUUfree Pacific Ocean
WCPFC17,669,Nauru on behalf of PNA members congratulated Korea and RMI for their successful use of the  Commissions IUU  process
WCPFC17,670,EU acknowledged that the CCMs had reached a satisfactory agreement and inquired whether Korea  had finalized all its internal procedures with regard to the case and stated it would be interested in receiving  updated information even if after WCPFC17 Korea stated that its internal process was ongoing and it  would update the Commission when the process is completed
WCPFC17,671,FSM on behalf of FFA members supported the retention of the 3 vessels NEPTUNE FU LIEN  No1 and YU FONG 168 on the IUU list for 2021 FFA members also affirmed the recommendation from  TCC16 to the Commission on the tasks for the Executive Director set out in paragraph 60 of the TCC16
WCPFC17,674,Summary Report They also acknowledged with appreciation the actions of the Republic of Korea as the  flag State to resolve the case concerning ORYONG NO 721 to the satisfaction of RMI as the coastal State

WCPFC17,677,In respect of the WCPFC IUU Vessel List 2021 the Commission approved the TCC16  recommendations in paragraph 60 of the TCC16 Summary Report and tasked the Executive Director to
WCPFC17,678,i seek the former flag States  cooperation to provide  any information on these  vessels  including their respective masters names  and nationalities  ii write to all CCMs requesting them to provide information to the Commission if the vessels  are located or if there are any known changes to name flag or registered owner including  any action that port States have taken such as denial of port entry and services to those  vessels or any information from cannery States of any landings made by these vessels  iii write a letter to other RFMOs conveying this same message for cooperation to locate these  vessels and  iv propose that any information received by the Executive Director is reported promptly to  CCMs  IUU Vessel List Cross Listing Procedures
WCPFC17,679,The Chair noted WCPFC172020DP11rev1 Discussion Paper on IUU Vessel Cross Listing  Procedures   revision 1 which was introduced by the EU under Agenda Item 4
WCPFC17,680,France stated that it conducts surveillance operations in the convention areas of both IATTC and  WCPFC It stated that cross listing would be a useful tool to combat the IUU fishing and supported efforts  to progress this issue
WCPFC17,681,Japan supported cross listing in the WCPFC noting that other RFMOs had introduced this and that  WCPFC members that are not members of other RFMOs could be unaware of the other IUU Vessel List  listings Japan stated that this was a good tool to combat IUU fishing in the WCPO However it suggested  the need to be careful about the procedure It raised the question of whether WCPFC should accept IUU  lists of other organisations without considering the contents and suggested that WCPFC should use a  confirmation procedure rather than a blanket acceptance of an IUU list stating this could give some comfort  to WCPFC members Japan noted that IUU lists from other RFMOs may contain two types of IUU vessel  listings those listed by the RFMO and those listed through a cross listing procedure and the need to be  clear about which IUU Vessel Lists would be crosslisted by WCPFC Japan noted that the crosslisting  policies of other RFMOs vary some have agreements with all RFMOs and some limit the scope to location  or species Japan suggested concerns about workload or unpredictable effect could possibly be addressed  through a focus on the Pacific Ocean and noted cross listing with the other Pacific RFMOs SPRFMO  IATTC and NPFC would be very useful
WCPFC17,684,Korea stated that as a responsible port and flag state it supported cross listing as it would contribute  to effective control and management of IUU fishing globally It acknowledged some issues with the  procedure but stated the benefits were far greater than the challenges that need to be addressed It supported  the way forward suggested in DP11 and stated it would provide comments to the EU
WCPFC17,685,The USA echoed the comments by Korea and generally supported cross listing and the proposal  stating that it has some questions on the process but that these could be addressed intersessionally
WCPFC17,686,FSM on behalf of FFA members stated they indicated in 2019 that this could have significant  implications and stated they looked forward to more information about the number of vessels that are listed  by other RFMOs
WCPFC17,687,Chinese Taipei stated it supports combatting IUU fishing and supported the concept of IUU Vessel  List cross listing However it has some technical concerns regarding the scope and procedure which could  be further discussed
WCPFC17,688,The EU thanked CCMs for their comments which it found to be largely encouraging and useful  and stated it understood there is work remaining to address the various concerns expressed The EU stated  it would be happy to continue this work if there was agreement from all members that there is value in doing  so and would respond to CCMs intersessionally Regarding FFAs  comments on assessment under CMM  201306 the EU stated that a range of issues were addressed in DP09 that are relevant under CMM 201306  although DP09 does not follow a certain format The EU observed that a comprehensive CMM 201306  assessment could not be undertaken satisfactorily solely by the EU It expressed the hope it could engage  with FFA members and seek their assistance in this process
WCPFC17,689,The Commission encouraged the EU and other interested CCMs to engage intersessionally on  the issue of crosslisting of  other RFMOs vessel lists

WCPFC17,713,141 Cetacean release guidelines  Ms Emily Crigler USA introduced WCPFC172020DP03 Best Handling Practices for the Safe
WCPFC17,714,Release of Cetaceans noting that the issue was discussed at WCPFC16 but was not raised at SC16 as  planned because of the virtual meeting limitations and suggested approval of a recommendation that the  issue be prioritized for discussion during SC17
WCPFC17,715,Korea stated it submitted a proposal to WCPFC16 based on the precautionary approach and stated
WCPFC17,716,it would submit a similar proposal to WCPFC18 It fully supported the proposal by the USA
WCPFC17,717,Japan stated it understood the logic of the proposal but was concerned about how busy SC17 would
WCPFC17,718,be in light of the fact that many aspects of SCs  work had been deferred in 2020 and it was thus not  convinced that priority should be given to this issue in 2021 Japan stated it did not support the USAs  proposal
WCPFC17,721,The EU agreed that the work was important and that SC should be tasked again to undertake it
WCPFC17,722,The USA echoed the remarks by the EU and Korea and sought guidance from the Commission or

WCPFC17,725,conveners and the Secretariat He stated there were several issues that were deferred in 2020 but it was  premature to provide comments on what the priorities would be
WCPFC17,726,Taking into account that that WCPFC16 tasked SC16 to develop and recommend best handling  practices for the release of cetaceans but SC16 could not complete not only this task but also many other  tasks due to the limited agenda resulting from COVID19 the Commission requested the Scientific  Committee to consider how to handle these outstanding tasks at SC17
WCPFC17,727,142 South Pacific Swordfish  Australia stated that in 2019 it proposed to pursue revision and strengthening of CMM 200903
WCPFC17,728,Conservation and Management for Swordfish As explained at WCPFC16 Australia believes that the  CMM fails to provide for the ongoing sustainability of the stock or protect the economic viability of existing  swordfish fisheries or the future development opportunities of SIDS There are no restrictions on fishing  mortality north of 20S and the limits south of 20S may not ensure the future sustainability of the stock  Australia stated that it is continuing preparatory work on a revised measure designed around a core set of  principles that were outlined at WCPFC16 The revised draft measure will be informed by a range of inputs  including
WCPFC17,729,A revised stock assessment in 2021    Two key pieces of technical work tasked to the SC by WCPFC16  o  a review of potential management provisions for swordfish taken as bycatch which was  discussed in the SC16 Online Discussion Forum SC16ODF01 Summary of Online  Discussion Forum and  o  an evaluation of the future stock status under a range of catch projection scenarios and  Ongoing consultations with members  Australia thanked all CCMs who engaged on the issue in 2020 and noted that no specific decisions were  required at WCPFC17 and encouraged CCMs to continue their constructive input and engagement on the  issues to secure better management of South Pacific swordfish

WCPFC18,8,Taotasi Archie Soilai (American Samoa Head of Delegation) offered the opening prayer.
WCPFC18,9,"The Commission Chair, Ms. Jung-re Riley Kim, welcomed all participants to WCPFC18, expressing her hope that everyone was well and safe, and her pleasure at seeing everyone, albeit online. She noted that she had shared her thoughts regarding the meeting priorities in writing prior to the meeting (in Circular 2021/101). She observed that despite the inability to meet in person, the Commission’s collective efforts had kept the region’s tuna stocks healthy, and CCMs had carried on important intersessional work. She expressed her sincere appreciation to all for their flexibility, patience, compromise and hard work leading up to WCPFC18. She noted that the international community’s attention was on the actions of the Commission at WCPFC18, in particular regarding the adoption of a new tropical tuna conservation and management measure (CMM). The Chair noted the two tropical tuna workshops that were held during 2021, and the further consultations that served as input to the Chair’s Consultative Draft, which would serve as a reference throughout the upcoming discussions. She stated that a spirit of cooperation would yield a result commensurate with the Commission’s efforts and reputation, and that she counted on CCMs’ close cooperation in this regard. She observed that WCPFC18 was also tasked with a wide array of other important issues, including the improvement of the compliance monitoring scheme (CMS), harvest strategy work, management of stocks other than tropical tuna, electronic monitoring and reporting, transhipment, and FAD management.  She emphasised the need to consider at all times the special requirements of small island developing states (SIDS), who are more vulnerable to the challenges and difficulties stemming from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. She stated that the global health crisis of the prior two years has tested the Commission’s solidarity and that CCMs had proven their collective strength. She expressed her confidence that at WCPFC18 CCMs could once again successfully meet the objectives of the Commission. She closed by thanking the Secretariat for their hard work, and subsidiary body Chairs, Co-Chairs, and Vice-Chairs for their excellent leadership. Her full remarks are included as Attachment B."
WCPFC18,10,"The WCPFC Executive Director, Feleti P Teo, OBE welcomed delegates to WCPFC18, noting it was the second time in the Commission’s history that its annual session was being held virtually. He stated that 2021 was very busy and intense for the WCPFC and its members, and for the Secretariat, noting the ambitious and substantive intersessional work programme set by the Commission at WCPFC17. He referenced the requirement to develop a new tropical tuna measure to succeed the current measure (CMM 2020-01) set to expire in February 2022. He stated that the existing measure had served the Commission well, and enabled the Commission to manage successfully the bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin tuna stocks, which are all assessed as being fished sustainably, an accomplishment unique only to the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) region. He reflected on the time and resources expended in 2021 in developing a new tropical tuna measure as worthwhile investment to ensure the new measure continue to achieve its conservation objectives as supported by the best scientific advice and information available, while permitting where feasible sustainable economic growth of the fishing industry. He noted that the two Commission-level workshops held in 2021 to develop a tropical tuna measure (chaired by the WCPFC Chair) covered much ground, and remarked on the commitment of Commission members to ensure continuation of the management regime for tropical tuna in 2022 and beyond. He also noted the need to continue the operation of the WCPFC compliance monitoring scheme (CMS) beyond 2021, noting that the CMS is at the core of the Commission’s ability to assess the compliance performance of each CCM against obligations under CMMs and other obligations CCMs committed to uphold. He committed all the resources WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  3    and time of the Secretariat to working closely with CCMs to find a way to allow the Commission to continue to assess annually the compliance performance of CCMs while also addressing any deficiencies and reforms needed to enhance the efficiency and equity of the CMS. He stated that his 2021 Annual Report documents and chronicles the many activities the Commission and members were engaged in, both at the Commission and subsidiary body level, and various intersessional working group activities. It also documents separately the activities attributed directly to the Secretariat, which were reported against the milestones and performance indicators in the Secretariat’s Corporate Plan. He observed that the Commission and its members as supported by the Secretariat were able to deliver on their key responsibilities for 2021, and hoped that the same level of success would also be reflected in the outcomes of WCPFC18. His full remarks are included as Attachment C. 1.1 Adoption of Agenda"
WCPFC18,11,The agenda was adopted (Attachment D).  1.2 Statements from Members and Participating Territories
WCPFC18,12,"The Chair, mindful of time constraints, encouraged CCMs to provide copies of their opening statements to the Secretariat for circulation and inclusion in the Summary Report. The Chair noted that opening statements had been received from American Samoa, Australia, Indonesia, the South Pacific Group (SPG, made up of Niue, Cook Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga), the Philippines, and Tuvalu."
WCPFC18,13,"American Samoa extended its welcome to the Chair, Heads of Delegations, the Executive Director, and members of WCPFC. In its remarks American Samoa stressed the existential relationship between its economy and tuna fishing and processing. It noted that American Samoa, with CNMI and Guam, submitted WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP09 Assessments under CMM 2013-06 for Proposed and Potential Provisions of a New Conservation and Management Measure for the Tropical Tuna Stocks, which contains information and detailed analyses intended to be used by the Commission to assess the future impacts of various potential management measures on SIDS. American Samoa stated its hope that any newly designed measures will not continue to transfer a disproportionate burden of conservation action onto any SIDS. It stressed that past implementations of certain tuna management measures have had a devastating effect on American Samoa despite its status as a SIDS, noting that some measures have contributed to the continued decline of U.S. flagged purse seine vessels that have historical significance to American Samoa’s economy and its tuna industry. American Samoa emphasised that this was due at least in part to the treatment of the locally based purse seine fleet, which has been regulated as U.S. flag purse seiners, not as locally based American Samoa tuna purse seiners. It emphasized the urgent need to fix this anomaly. As a SIDS, American Samoa stated it looked forward to working with all CCMs to remedy the situation."
WCPFC18,14,"Australia welcomed the Chair, Executive Director, guests, members and observers at WCPFC18, and acknowledged the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are the traditional custodians of its country, stating it extends that respect to other Indigenous peoples. Australia expressed its gratitude to the CCMs who worked online throughout 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and commended members for continuing to progress strong outcomes through the Commission. Australia also thanked the Secretariat for its thorough preparations for WCPFC18, noting that the high quality of the Secretariat’s work helped in ensuring CCMs were prepared to discuss and advance the Commission’s wide-ranging work. Australia stated it was pleased that all four major commercial tuna stocks remain above sustainable limits despite the challenges presented by the pandemic. It stated that the Commission should continue to manage its shared fish stocks in line with best practice, to ensure they remain sustainable well into the future. It noted the tropical tuna discussions had been the primary focus of the Commission in 2021 and looked forward to continuing strong management in a new CMM, and advocated that a new measure be in place WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  4    for several years to allow the Commission time to progress other critical work. Australia stated its strong commitment to the ongoing development and implementation of harvest strategies by the Commission, observing that these are essential to achieve long-term security of migratory tuna stocks. It also supported implementation of a robust and effective CMS to monitor and review compliance with the Commission’s CMMs, and stated that having an effective, efficient, fair and constructive CMS remains a priority for Australia. Australia also extended its thanks to the Chair for her leadership in 2021, and welcomed her continued guidance. Australia closed by noting its commitment to ensuring the WCPFC continues to lead in the effective management of WCPO migratory stocks; it observed that the Commission’s success is built on the hard work and cooperation of its members, and it looked forward to working constructively and effectively with the Secretariat and participants at WCPFC18."
WCPFC18,15,"Indonesia acknowledged the Secretariat’s work in facilitating the virtual WCPFC18 amidst the obstacles of the COVID-19 pandemic and expressed appreciation to the Chair, the Executive Director, and committee and working group chairs for their work throughout the year. It also expressed solidarity with the CCMs in their fight against COVID-19 and extended condolences for their losses. Indonesia looked forward to fruitful and amicable discussions at WCPFC18. Indonesia stated that formulation of the new tropical tuna CMM should accommodate the rights of developing coastal states and SIDS, and stressed the importance of developing the new CMM properly and responsibly, taking into account the rights of local communities. Indonesia stated it had consistently fulfilled its responsibilities to WCPFC in preparing its annual report to meet scientific and compliance requirements. It stated that its catch limit for tropical tuna (e.g., bigeye) was not fully utilized, and it had not fished in the high seas for seven years (2015-2021), which contributed to the continued efforts to adopt a precautionary approach by reducing fishing effort in the high seas and to combat IUU Fishing in the WCPO. Indonesia stated it was contributing essential effort to supporting the accelerated rebuilding of bigeye stocks in the WCPO, and therefore its effort of managing its fleets in such a precautionary way should be addressed as a reward in relation to direct support for the tropical tuna CMM. In the context of utilization of the stocks in the WCPO, Indonesia stated it retained its right to have access and opportunity to fish in the high seas of WCPO as required. Indonesia stated its willingness to continuously improve its tuna fisheries management and welcomed any collaboration from other CCMs as well as the Secretariat to ensure the sustainability of WCPO stocks. Indonesia referenced its development of an Interim Harvest Strategy Framework for tropical tuna in Indonesian archipelagic waters (begun in 2014 and launched in 2018), and stated it disseminated annual updates of its harvest strategy progress to various WCPFC bodies. It noted the challenges it faces, and stated that it obtained many inputs and support from fishery stakeholders and experts in progressing harvest strategy development and implementation. Indonesia stated its willingness to collaborate with neighbouring countries to ensure the sustainability of the tropical tunas stocks in the region. Indonesia noted that some of the proposed timelines for development of harvest strategies by WCPFC had not been met, and suggested expediting their development, and revisiting the timeline adopted in CMM 2014-06. Indonesia also drew attention to intersessional discussions regarding the CMM on crew labour standards, co-chaired by Indonesia and New Zealand. It noted that although the discussions remain in progress, it was of utmost importance to finalize and adopt the proposal to avoid and mitigate the risks of further abuse to crew members perpetrated by captains and vessel owners that operate in the WCPFC Convention Area (WCPFC-CA). Indonesia also reiterated the provision in Article 4 of the WCPFC Convention that nothing in the Convention shall prejudice the rights, jurisdiction, and duties of States under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA), and that the Convention should be interpreted and applied in the context of and in a manner consistent with these international agreements. In concluding Indonesia stated its hope that the deliberations at WCPFC18 would provide beneficial results that contribute significantly to joint efforts to meet the WCPFC’s objectives, and underlined its willingness to work constructively and cooperatively with other delegations during WCPC18."
WCPFC18,16,"Niue, on behalf of the South Pacific Group (SPG) stated it is an informal group of SIDS who share strong interests in the sustainable development of the southern longline fisheries for southern albacore, WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  5    swordfish, bigeye and yellowfin. The SPG includes Cook Islands, Fiji, Niue, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu. The SPG stated that longline provisions of the tropical tuna CMM must recognise the sovereign rights of coastal States to manage fishing activity within their EEZs, in accordance with the provisions of the WCPF Convention and UNCLOS. The SPG stated that any vessel fishing in their waters should be managed under their management framework, including any applicable limits, in the same manner that any catch taken in waters under national jurisdiction is attributed to the coastal State. SPG members stated they prioritise the development by the WCPFC of zone-based management for all longline fisheries, and look forward to working with other members in developing sustainable and equitable limits that respect rights for the high seas and coastal State sovereign rights for EEZs.  They strongly supported the retention of paragraph 44 of the current CMM, including the amendments proposed by FFA, and advocated that WCPFC19 in 2022 determine hard high seas limits for bigeye in 2022, and apply those limits to CCMs in a manner that is consistent with their sovereign rights, and Articles 8, 10 (3) and 30 of the Convention. SPG members expressed their deep concerned at the continuing decline of South Pacific albacore fisheries and the impact on their fisheries-dependent economies. They noted that southern fisheries interact with the tropical longline fisheries, and are impacted by changes in tropical longline management, fishing activities and catches. Consequently, they stated that they believe it is critical to avoid any increase in longline fishing effort, or increase in bigeye limits. SPG members stated that any such increase, particularly south of the equator, would result in additional catches of albacore, resulting in a disproportionate burden on SPG members, and that such increases may also result in fleet behavioural changes that could negatively impact their southern longline fisheries. SPG members advocated that the tropical tuna CMM not allow for any overall increase in longline fishing effort, or any overall increase in bigeye limits, and noted that any proposal to increase tropical longline fishing effort, or an overall increase in bigeye limits, must consider the impact on SIDS as per CMM 2013-06. They noted that this obviously includes other territories outside the FFA group, and recognised the development aspirations and concerns of those territories. SPG members stated they would be seeking further study on the interactions and impacts of longline fishing effort on their southern longline fisheries, and called for an immediate freeze on albacore catch from the high seas."
WCPFC18,17,"The Philippines expressed it appreciation to the Secretariat for making the WCPFC18 meeting arrangements amid the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to CCMs located in different time zones for their flexibility and sustained participation, while acknowledging the difficulties they face. The Philippines also expressed appreciation for the support of the Commission through the West Pacific East Asia (WPEA) Project for technical assistance to enhance its capacity in providing the data to address WCPFC17’s recommendations on paragraph 51 (Other Commercial Fisheries) of CMM 2020-01. It stated that it continues to make progress in complying with the CMM through enhanced implementing regulations and was confident it would be able to address outstanding issues. It stated its commitment to engaging positively with all CCMs, to listening and understanding their concerns, and to presenting its views and concerns for the formulation of an inclusive and robust tropical tuna measure. The Philippines also solicited support from the Commission for its efforts to strengthen control of Philippine-flagged vessels through its upgraded vessel monitoring system (VMS), which would enable it to fulfil its obligations as a responsible flag state. It expressed its commitment to working with the Commission towards this end. The Philippines also thanked the Secretariat for its assistance to the Philippines and other CCMs for their collective effort to progress the objectives of the Commission in the sustainable utilization of the straddling and highly migratory fish stocks in the WCPO, particularly tropical tunas, which are critically important to the overall economy of the Philippines, especially in providing food and livelihood to millions of Filipinos."
WCPFC18,18,"Tuvalu expressed its support for the Chair, ably supported by the WCPFC Executive Director and his team, and extended greetings to the Ministers, officials, secretariats and all participants in WCPFC18. It noted that while Tuvalu’s officials have worked through a long series of video-conferences, it is often difficult to reach agreement on complex issues in this way, and expressed the hope that CCMs could make substantive progress during WCPFC18, while noting the need to ensure that strong management measures were in place at the end of the meeting, even if agreement could not be reached on all the desired changes. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  6    Tuvalu stated that the tropical tuna CMM is the key issue at WCPFC18 meeting for Tuvalu, stating that these stocks, and the economic benefits that derive from them, are vital for the future well-being of the country and its people. It stated that the current measure served the Commission well, and continues to ensure that the main tuna stocks are harvested sustainably. Tuvalu stated that it approached the discussions asking ‘why change something that is working well?’ However, it stated it also recognized that members all have their own interests, and some feel that the current measures are too precautionary, or are not to the advantage of their national fleets. Tuvalu urged CCMs to exercise restraint in seeking changes to the current well-balanced package of measures, and stated that if changes were made they needed to reflect the balance between fisheries and the interests of members, particularly respecting the legitimate aspirations of SIDS. Tuvalu noted the extensive discussions that had been held between CCMs regarding the objectives for the new CMM. It noted that while this was understandable – setting objectives is normally the first step in a plan of action –for reasons well known to CCMs it was difficult to reach agreement. It noted that the new tropical tuna measure remained a bridging measure while important work on harvest strategies continued, and urged members to leave aside differences on objectives and ensure a CMM is passed that ensures stocks are sustainable. Tuvalu stated that it was optimistic that agreement on a new tropical tuna measure would be reached, but that there were many differences in national positions, and advocated that if agreement could not be reached, the Commission should revert to what had been agreed in the past and retain the current CMM. In view of the time and effort already been invested in the process, Tuvalu stated it did not want to repeat the process again in 2022, and advocated any CMM should be adopted for a further 3 years, to allow substantive progress on harvest strategies. 1.3 Meeting Arrangements"
WCPFC18,19,"The Commission reviewed the meeting arrangements and indicative meeting schedule, and confirmed decisions made at the Heads of Delegation meeting, held on 28 November, including affirming the meeting schedule, as announced in Circular 2021/99 of 12 November 2021."
WCPFC18,20,"The EU acknowledged the efforts made by the Chair and the Secretariat in arranging the meeting agenda and the schedule. The EU noted that since the beginning of the pandemic it has advocated that meeting schedules be set so as to share the burden among all CCMs, noting that this was being done by other regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs). The EU stated that unfortunately in the WCPFC the concept of balanced meeting schedules had not been adopted, which resulted in the inability of the EU to participate in several intersessional meetings. It stated that it had proposed several options to share the burden, which would mean that one or two sessions would extend beyond the working hours of the Secretariat, but that this had been opposed by some CCMs. The EU recognized the effort to alleviate its concerns through the inclusion of break days, and stated it would participate in the meeting in a constructive spirit. It closed by reiterating its thanks to the Chair for her efforts to develop the schedule under such difficult circumstances.   1.3.1 Online meeting protocols"
WCPFC18,21,"The Secretariat’s IT Manager, Mr. Tim Jones, explained the key online meeting protocols.    1.3.2  Establishment of small working groups (CNMs, CMR, others)"
WCPFC18,22,"The Commission agreed to establish three SWGs: (i) a CNM SWG, chaired by the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC) vice-chair Ms. Emily Crigler (USA); a Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR) SWG, chaired by the TCC Chair, Mr. Mat Kertesz; and a List of Obligations SWG to consider the obligations to be addressed under the CMS in 2022, chaired by Ms. Heather Ward (New Zealand). WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  7"
WCPFC18,23,"China supported the establishment of the SWGs, while noting that with respect to the List of Obligations SWG, because the Commission did not adopt any new measures in 2021 the list should remain unchanged from that considered in 2021.  AGENDA ITEM 2   — ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR"
WCPFC18,24,"The Executive Director’s Annual Report (WCPFC18-2021-04), which is a requirement under Rule 13 of the Commission’s Rules of Procedure, was issued on October 18, and was taken as read. The paper was posted on the WCPFC18 ODF (as Topic A); and the Executive Director confirmed no comments were exchanged on the ODF."
WCPFC18,25,"PNG thanked the Executive Director for the report and for the work described in it. It asked for clarification on the status of the IT system upgrade and what further work is planned, as well as additional information regarding the work on streamlined reporting and the ability of the system to accommodate additional reporting as may be required under new or revised CMMs. The Finance and Administration Manager, Mr. Aaron Nighswander, stated the Secretariat would be updating IT systems as it transitions to a new platform with additional capabilities, and would provide more detail as those updates proceeded. The Compliance Manager, Dr. Lara Manarangi-Trott, noted that the systems upgrade is described in the latter part of the Executive Director’s report; the work underway was described in some detailed during TCC17, and in WCPFC18-2021-IP12, which reports against the forecast the Secretariat has made with respect to the work that may be tasked to the Secretariat as a result of WCPFC18 decisions. She noted that much of that is driven by the TCC work program and the CMS. She stated that the IT Manger has led the team of consultants undertaking the IT work and has begun migration of the CCFS, which should be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2022. The Commission’s existing ER system is used for high seas transhipment reporting and remains operational; no disruptions are expected. She stated that some work remains to be done regarding the Record of Fishing Vessels (RFV), which is scheduled to be undertaken following completion of the CCFS work, and that the Secretariat would look at the system for CCMs’ Annual Reports following confirmation of any enhancements to be undertaken under the CMS. She stated that a number of papers presented to TCC outlined the expectations, and as the Secretariat reported to FAC, progress remained largely on track. The IT Manager added that from a capacity perspective most of the Commission’s external facing sites are cloud-based, and thus housed in an environment that can be readily scaled up if more resources are needed."
WCPFC18,26,The Commission adopted the 2021 Annual Report of the Executive Director (WCPFC18-2021-04).   AGENDA ITEM 3  —  MEMBERSHIP AND OTHER APPLICATIONS 3.1 Status of the Convention
WCPFC18,27,"New Zealand’s report as the Depositary on the status of the WCPF Convention (WCPFC18-2021-05 Status of the Convention) was taken as read. The Executive Director confirmed that the paper was included in the WWCPFC18 ODF as Topic E, but no comments were received."
WCPFC18,28,The Commission noted with appreciation the report on the Status of the WCPF Convention (WCPFC18-2021-05).  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  8    3.2 Update on Observer Status
WCPFC18,29,"The Chair noted with appreciation the contributions of the accredited observers to the work of the Commission. The Secretariat’s updated report on observer status (WCPFC18-2021-06 List of Observers) was taken as read; it notes that no state or NGO observers were removed in 2021 under the requirements of Rule 36 of the Rules of Procedure. The Executive Director confirmed that the paper was included in the WCPFC18 ODF as Topic D, but no comments were received."
WCPFC18,30,The Commission noted the updated list of observers to the Commission (WCPFC18-2021-06).   3.3 Applications for Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) status
WCPFC18,31,"The Commission considered applications for Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) status for 2022 in accordance with CMM 2019-01, including recommendations from TCC17. The Chair noted that as outlined in WCPFC18-2021-07: Cooperating Non-Member Requests for 2022_rev2, there were eight applications for CNM status in 2022 from the Curacao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam. All applicants for 2022 were CNMs in 2021; of the 2021 CNMs, only the Bahamas did not apply for CNM status in 2022, but the Bahamas remained a CNM until the end of 2021."
WCPFC18,32,"The Assistant Compliance Manager stated that all CNMs had made the required payments for 2021, and that of the 8 applicants, 7 were currently attending; all were registered but Liberia had yet to join the meeting. The TCC Vice-Chair and Chair of CNM SWG stated that there had been two requests for additional information made by TCC to CNMs (one to Liberia and one to Nicaragua), and that the requested information had been received."
WCPFC18,33,"The Commission noted and accepted the 8 applications for CNM status in 2022 from Curacao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam. The Commission agreed that the CNM SWG would meet to work on CNM participatory rights, and that applicants could attend the SWG to provide clarifications and answers to questions that might be posed. Following its deliberations, the SWG would provide advice to the Commission on the participatory rights of CNMs (under Agenda Item 3.3.1)."
WCPFC18,34,"The Commission approved the applications for CNM status for 2022 from Curaçao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam.  3.3.1 Participatory rights of CNMs"
WCPFC18,35,The Commission reviewed the limits of participatory rights of CNMs under various CMMs in accordance with paragraphs 12 and 13 of CMM 2019-01.
WCPFC18,36,"The Commission agreed to the following limits to be applied to the participatory rights of CNMs per the Convention and CMM 2019-01: i. In accordance with the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following participatory rights apply to Cooperating Non- Members (CNMs) for fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area.  ii. In addition, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under their national jurisdiction or other CCMs’ national jurisdiction, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  9    iii. CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPF Convention and the WCPFC conservation and management measures. In addition, CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV).  iv. CCMs shall ensure that CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention.  v. Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will take into account compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, and all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention. CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the Secretariat for attention by TCC.  Participatory rights of each CNM in 2022"
WCPFC18,37,"The Commission considered the findings of the CNM SWG, which recommended that Curacao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam retain the same participatory rights in 2022 as they had in 2021. The CNM SWG also noted that in both 2020 and 2021, Nicaragua requested that the CNM SWG and the Commission consider revising their participatory rights to increase purse seine fishing from one to two vessels. Nicaragua indicated that the addition of one vessel would greatly assist in allowing the timely submission of financial contributions and further enhance their ability to implement WCPFC CMMs in the WCPFC-CA. CNM SWG participants were unable to support the requested addition to Nicaragua’s participatory rights for 2022 due to the existing purse seine capacity limits as stipulated in paragraph 45 of the current tropical tuna measure (CMM 2020-01/2018-01). However, to assist the Commission with considering any increased participatory rights in the future, the CNM SWG invited Nicaragua to put forward any proposed changes to participatory rights when submitting their CNM application in future years, to allow TCC to properly consider the implications of such a request prior to the Commission’s annual meeting."
WCPFC18,38,Curaçao: The participatory rights of Curacao are limited to carrier vessels to engage in transhipment activities in the Convention area.
WCPFC18,39,"Ecuador: The participatory rights of Ecuador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2019-01 and CMM 2020-01 or its replacement measure."
WCPFC18,40,El Salvador: The participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. The total level of effort by purse seine vessels of El Salvador on the high seas shall not exceed 29 days in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2019-01 and CMM 2020-01 or its replacement measure.
WCPFC18,41,Liberia: The participatory rights of Liberia are limited to carrier vessels to engage in transhipment activities in the Convention area.

Any introduction of fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2019-01 and CMM 2020-01 or its replacement measure. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  10"
WCPFC18,43,"Panama: The participatory rights of Panama in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels. Panama’s participatory rights also apply to vessels that supply food, water and spare parts to carrier vessels that engage in transhipment activities, provided that these vessels do not engage in activities supporting fishing vessels, including providing and/or servicing FADs."
WCPFC18,44,Thailand: The participatory rights of Thailand in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.
WCPFC18,45,Vietnam: The participatory rights of Vietnam in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.  WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area
WCPFC18,46,"In accordance with the decision of WCPFC9 regarding the management of the overlap area of 4˚S and 50˚S between 130˚W and 150˚W, vessels flagged to Ecuador, El Salvador and Nicaragua and Panama will be governed by the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area."
WCPFC18,47,"In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area."
WCPFC18,48,"For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with international and domestic laws, vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area.   AGENDA ITEM 4  — NEW PROPOSALS   Tropical Tuna CMM"
WCPFC18,49,"The Chair’s introduction, CCMs’ introductory statements, and the Commission’s further deliberations on the Chair Consultative draft on a new tropical tuna CMM are addressed under Agenda Item 7.2.2.  Revisions to the CMM for sharks (WCPFC18-2021-DP01)"
WCPFC18,50,"The USA introduced its proposed revisions to the CMM for Sharks (CMM 2019-04) as detailed in WCPFC18-2021-DP01 Proposed Revisions to the Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks. (Agenda Item 4). The USA stated that the current WCPFC shark measure, CMM 2019-04, includes a number of provisions applicable generally for shark conservation and management, and specifically to stocks of concern. Two of the stocks included are the oceanic whitetip shark, which is experiencing overfishing and is overfished, and the silky shark, which is experiencing overfishing. The USA stated that the Commission has prohibited retention of both of these species, but further action is needed to rebuild these stocks, noting that SC17 reviewed analysis conducted under WCPFC Project 101 that indicated that: WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  11    a prohibiting shark lines could reduce fishing mortality for oceanic whitetip sharks by 5.4% and for silky sharks by 2.6%, and  b prohibiting wire trace as branchlines could reduce fishing mortality of oceanic whitetip sharks by about 36%, and of silky sharks by about 28%.   That analysis further indicated that prohibiting both shark lines and wire trace as branchlines had the potential to reduce fishing mortality by approximately 40% for oceanic whitetip sharks and 31% for silky sharks.  The USA stated it is important for the Commission to act to enhance protections for sharks generally, and that the proposed prohibitions would have a significant benefit for silky shark and oceanic whitetip shark stocks. The USA stated its proposal modifies paragraph 14 to prohibit both the use of wire trace as branch lines and the use of shark lines, and deletes paragraph 15 requiring CCMs to notify the Commission as to which option (wire trace or shark lines) is prohibited on a vessel by vessel or fleet basis. The current shark CMM only requires CCMs to prohibit the use of wire trace as branch lines or the use of shark lines. The proposal also modifies the implementation deadline to January 2023, and removes a footnote, which delayed implementation of the measure until 2021."
WCPFC18,51,"Tokelau, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the USA for this proposal and the completed 2013-06 assessment, stating that they appreciated this and considered it a good example of an assessment under CMM 2013-06. FFA members noted that this is an important issue for them, and that the use of wire traces and shark lines by longline vessels operating within FFA members’ waters is already prohibited through FFA’s Harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions. They supported the proposal from the USA."
WCPFC18,52,"Canada supported the proposal, noting its concern about the status of sharks globally, and stated that it agreed that the measures outlined would help restore populations of these shark species in the WCPO."
WCPFC18,53,"The EU noted its interest in ideas and proposals that reduce the impact on species caught in association with WCPFC fisheries. It noted that silky and oceanic whitetip sharks were already protected through a non-retention ban, and stated this appeared to be having a positive impact in terms of reduced mortality, especially in the case of silky sharks. The EU stated that exploring mitigation measures was central to the conservation of bycatch species, and that a study presented to TCC17 showed that the adoption of wire leaders would reduce bycatch and mortality, but as noted by several CCMs at TCC17 much work remained to be done. The EU stressed that past experience has shown that mitigation measures can yield different results depending on the fishery and species in question, and referenced a study in the Indian ocean that suggested that use of monofilament could increase bycatch of silky sharks. The EU also stated that mitigation measures may have differing impacts depending on the situation. It stated that it understood the intent, but that the proposal should take into account a number of relevant considerations (such as the species distribution, and interaction rates by gear, area, and season). Noting that SC17 requested further analysis that should be reviewed at SC18, the EU suggested further analysis might allow SC to develop recommendations on specific mitigation measures that could reduce mortality for these species. It looked forward to considering specific recommendations from SC18 on this issue."
WCPFC18,54,"China stated its view was similar to that of the EU, noting the preliminary nature of the information, and stated it would welcome consideration of the issue after receiving specific recommendations from SC. It stated it was unable to support implementation of the proposed recommendations at WCPFC18."
WCPFC18,55,"Japan also agreed on the lack of clear scientific evidence to impose the proposed measure, and called for further study."
WCPFC18,56,Chinese Taipei agreed on the need for additional study.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  12
WCPFC18,57,"FSM on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau supported the USA proposal to ban wire traces and shark lines in longline fisheries. They stated that they expect that removal of both wire traces and shark lines would be very effective at reducing shark mortality, noting that PNA members and Tokelau have a number of domestic laws banning both wire traces and shark lines, and that some members have gone further by banning targeted shark fishing and implementing shark sanctuaries."
WCPFC18,58,"WWF, Pew, and The Ocean Foundation thanked the USA for conducting the scientific study, submitting the proposal, and in particular noted the support that was provided by the Hawaii longline fleet in the study. They noted that the work was built on previous work by Harley et al and constitutes the best available scientific evidence as established under the WCPF Convention. They stated it has been put before SC twice and as such been fully vetted and subject to peer review. They noted that as FFA and the PNA stated, the measure is already in place across most of the WCPFC region through the FFA’s Harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions. They stated that if a simple change in gear to mitigate shark mortality is unacceptable, the Commission has no choice but to consider reducing longline effort in areas with greater interactions with oceanic whitetip, as WCPFC has a responsibility to rebuild depleted species such as oceanic whitetip, and appropriately manage species caught in association with fishing."
WCPFC18,59,"The USA stated it would continue discussions in 2022 through TCC and SC, and hoped to submit a new proposal to WCPFC19. Amendment to the Charter Notification CMM (WCPFC18-2021-DP02)"
WCPFC18,60,"Japan introduced its proposed amendment to CMM 2019-08: WCPFC18-2021-DP02. Proposed amendment to the current CMM 2019-08 for Charter Notification Scheme, noting that CMM 2019-08 will expire on 28 February 2022 unless renewed by the Commission. It stated that this CMM is critical for the Commission as it clarifies the attribution of catch and efforts of chartered vessels, and enables the compiling of fundamental catch and effort data for each CCM. In this context, Japan proposed the extension of the CMM, with two amendments. To ensure that the information of charter notifications is transmitted to the SSP (SPC) in a timely manner, so that the SSP can compile catch and effort data for each CCM accurately, Japan proposed amendments to paragraphs 2 and 3, so that charter information is transmitted to the SSP at the same time as to flag States and the Secretariat. In addition, to compile catch and effort data accurately, Japan propose amending paragraph 2 to add “the area of application” to the list of information to be notified."
WCPFC18,61,"In the ensuing discussion CCMs noted the importance of the Charter Notification CMM, including for compiling accurate catch and effort data, and to support the domestic development (and the special requirements) of SIDS CCMs, and supported the extension of the CMM. The value of the additional reporting specifications proposed by Japan was also noted.  Proposal to amend CMM 2019-08 Charter Notification Scheme (WCPFC18-2021-DP02_rev1 - Japan)"
WCPFC18,62,The Commission adopted CMM 2021-04 Conservation and Management Measure on Charter Notification Scheme (Attachment E)  IUU Vessel Cross-Listing (WCPFC18-2021-DP03)
WCPFC18,63,"The EU introduced a joint proposal by Canada, the EU, Japan and Chinese Taipei for amending CMM 2019-07 regarding the WCPFC IUU Vessel List, as detailed in WCPFC18-2021-DP03-rev2 Proposal for amending CMM 2019-07 (WCPFC IUU Vessel List. The EU stated that inputs from sponsors, the Secretariat, the Legal Adviser and other CCMs had allowed significant improvements. In light of WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  13    comments received and to further reduce the risk of additional workload and administrative burden for SIDS and the Secretariat, it stated that the proposal limits the cross listing to only tuna RFMOs and RFMOs with competences in the Pacific. Additionally, for the same reason, the procedure for the automatic delisting was limited to only once in the year, at the same time as the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. It also clarified that the Secretariat and CCMs will not need to review the information that led to the original listing of the vessels when considering the cross listing of vessel listed by other RFMOs. It noted that this would create a single tool for the members of WCPFC to identify if a vessel operating within the WCPFC-CA is currently listed in any of the cross-listed RFMO IUU list, thereby significantly reducing the time required for screening all IUU lists of each RFMO before (for example) granting port access to a particular fishing vessel. It advocated that the proposed revision to the CMM could contribute to effectively reducing workloads, especially for small administrations."
WCPFC18,64,This issue was further discussed under Agenda Item 11. Proposals by the Northern Committee
WCPFC18,65,"The NC Chair, Mr. Masanori Miyahara (Japan) noted with appreciation to the Secretariat the reference paper WCPFC18-2021-19 Reference Document for the review of CMM 2019-02 and development of harvest strategies (Pacific Bluefin Tuna) and Highlights from NC17 for Agenda 9.3, which was prepared by the Secretariat and presents two NC proposals before WCPFC18."
WCPFC18,66,"The NC Chair stated detailed explanation would be deferred to Agenda Item 7.4 for the proposed revision to CMM 2019-02 for Pacific bluefin tuna, and to agenda Item 9.3 for the Harvest Strategy alteration for Pacific bluefin tuna. Best Handling Practices for Marine Mammals"
WCPFC18,67,"The TCC Chair introduced the guidelines contained in WCPFC18-2021-26 for best handling practices of marine mammals, specifically cetaceans, for purse seine and longline vessels fishing for tuna and tuna-like species in the WCPO. The TCC Chair stated that SC17 considered a paper prepared by the United States presenting draft Best Practices for the Safe Handling and Release of Cetaceans. The best practices were subsequently considered in detail by both the SC and TCC. SC17 recommended that the draft best handling practices be forwarded to TCC17 and WCPFC18 for consideration, and that the Commission develop graphics to be included with the best handling practices for consideration at WCPFC19. TCC17 in turn endorsed the Best Practices for the Safe Handling and Release of Cetaceans (TCC17-2021-23) pending revisions suggested by a CCM at TCC17, and noted that a revised version of the best practices would be submitted to WCPFC18 for its review and endorsement. The Secretariat, in consultation with the TCC Chair and TCC-Vice Chair, prepared the guidelines presented in WCPFC18-2021-26 for review and consideration by WCPFC18. The amendments suggested at TCC17 were agreed in principle by TCC17 and were fully incorporated; they can be seen in track changes in attachment A to WCPFC18-2021-26."
WCPFC18,68,This issue was further discussed under Agenda Item 9.2.  AGENDA ITEM 5  — INTERSESSIONAL DECISIONS IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19
WCPFC18,69,"The Chair noted that the Secretariat’s discussion paper WCPFC18-2021-08 COVID-19 Related Intersessional Decisions was taken as read, and reflected the outcomes and discussion at TCC17. The paper was posted on the WCPFC18 ODF as Topic B, and no comments were received. In the TCC17 Summary Report, TCC17 recommended:  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  14    • that WCPFC18 continue the suspensions of the three intersessional decisions after 15 December until 15 March 2022; and  • that the Commission review through an expedited inter-sessional decision-making process, the possible phasing in of the removal of the suspensions, which would need to be implemented flexibly and be subject to a periodic review in light of changed circumstances."
WCPFC18,70,"The EU observed that COVID-19 situation had worsened since TCC17, and that it was less confident now regarding the full redeployment of observers in 2022. It stated that creative thinking was needed on how to proceed, as the lack of observers was impacting both scientific advice and compliance monitoring. It noted that WCPFC18-2021-08 indicates there are increased unobserved activities (e.g., only 70% of transhipments were observed). The EU stated that there is little information regarding additional MCS measures that CCMs have put in place, and suggested that a requirement be added to any new intersessional decision that CCMs using derogations indicate in their Annual Reports any additional MCS measures that they apply. The EU suggested that this could be used by TCC18 to assess the monitoring of the impact of COVID-19, and shape future decisions if the pandemic continues."
WCPFC18,71,"PNG, on behalf of FFA members, supported the TCC17 recommendations to WCPFC18 to continue the suspensions of the three intersessional decisions until 15 March 2022, and further recommended that WCPFC18 lift the suspension of the obligation relating to at sea transhipment by purse vessels (thereby reinstating this obligation) as of 15 March 2022, as part of a phased-in approach to lifting the suspensions. FFA members encouraged CCMs to use the FFA COVID-19 Operating Protocols for the Fishing Sector in the Pacific, which were shared with CCMs prior to TCC16 and updated in April 2021, and to prioritise the vaccination of fishing vessel crew, as two key requirements to re-commence deployment of observers on fishing vessels. FFA members highlighted that, notwithstanding the temporary suspension of observer coverage requirements and noting that the suspension does not prevent the placement of observers on fishing vessels, few FFA members were able to deploy observers on fishing vessels during the COVID-19 pandemic. FFA members encouraged CCMs that are able to start redeploying observers on their vessels, and to work with observer providers to operationalise the Protocols in order to enable observers to be safely placed on fishing vessels."
WCPFC18,72,The Commission noted the paper on COVID-19 related Intersessional Decisions prepared by the Secretariat (WCPFC18-2021-08).
WCPFC18,73,The Commission agreed to continue the suspensions of the three intersessional decisions after 15 December until 15 March 2022.
WCPFC18,74,"The Commission agreed to review through an expedited inter-sessional decision-making process, the possible phasing in of the removal of the suspensions, which would need to be implemented flexibly and be subject to a periodic review in light of changed circumstances."
WCPFC18,75,"The Commission encouraged CCMs to provide additional information on their implementation of the Intersessional Decisions taken in response to COVID-19, including of additional MCS measures implemented, through their Annual Report Part 2 reporting or via circular.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  15    AGENDA ITEM 6  — SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES  6.1 Implementation of Article 30 of WCPFC Convention and CMM 2013-07 (SIDS special requirements)"
WCPFC18,76,"The Chair noted that para. 20 of CMM 2013-07 requires an annual review of implementation of this measure, and referenced WCPFC18-2021-IP01 Summary from Part 2 CMM 2013-07 paragraph 19 annual reports (WCPFC-TCC16-2020-11_rev1)."
WCPFC18,77,The Executive Director stated that there were no issues related to Agenda item 6.1 raised in the ODF.
WCPFC18,78,"RMI on behalf of FFA members stated that the full recognition of the special requirements of SIDS is the cornerstone of fisheries governance in the region. FFA members stated that Article 30 is the “foundation” upon which the Convention is built, which underscores the importance that FFA members attach to the full recognition of the special requirements of SIDS. To appreciate the significance of this agenda item to SIDS, they noted that the map of the region shows States have the responsibility to manage fisheries over vast areas of ocean, in addition to their development aspirations. FFA members noted they have introduced initiatives such as CMM 2013-06 (the criteria to be applied when considering proposals for measures) and CMM 2013-07 (overarching principles in support of the full recognition of SIDS special requirements). To improve the implementation of CMM 2013-06 FFA members have repeatedly called for accurate and complete assessments on the impacts of proposals that take into account the views of SIDS, and indicated that an assessment that is inaccurate and incomplete will not comply with the binding requirements in that measure. From 2022 FFA members stated they would not entertain any proposal that does not have a CMM 13-06 assessment that was developed in consultation with them. FFA members noted that CMM 2013-07 is also an important binding measure, which provides principles that also take into account provisions in the UNFSA. FFA members invited other CCMs to also note the principles in that measure relating to allocation as they support SIDS’ domestic development aspirations. FFA members stated that Article 30 of the Convention (as well as articles 24–26 of the UNFSA), CMM 2013-06, and CMM 2013-07 provide a robust framework for the full recognition of SIDS’ special requirements. FFA members stated that it was up to them to determine what their special requirements are, and to determine their domestic development aspirations. They called on developed CCMs to provide targeted assistance that is aligned with SIDS’ domestic development aspirations and special requirements, and thanked CCMs and the Commission for the assistance rendered to SIDS. FFA members also reiterated that Article 30 of the Convention and the various binding measures referred to earlier are fundamental and must be taken into consideration at every aspect of the work of the Commission. FFA members stated they continue to stress the importance of a 2013-06 assessment of any proposed measure, in close consultation with SIDS, to ensure that it does not result in transferring, directly or indirectly, any disproportionate burden of conservation and management action onto SIDS and territories. In addition, they stated that there is a need to ensure effective participation of SIDS in the work of the Commission, by ensuring there are no barriers to engagement such as meeting outside business hours of the Secretariat. They thanked the Chair for taking this into account in the schedule of WCPFC18. They stressed that the most important issue is ensuring opportunities for SIDS participation in the fishery, now and in the future, and that the negotiation of the tropical tuna CMM, and any other measure, must take this into account, especially given that the WCPO is largely made up of the EEZs of Pacific Island SIDS. They stated that any proposal that will hinder SIDS’ participation in the fisheries is in direct contravention of Article 30 of the Convention. FFA members also noted that the Commission’s annual budget has increased over time, as have the financial obligations of CCMs through the assessed contributions. As noted in past meetings, FFA members stated they are concerned with the increasing trend in the budget and the assessed contributions and reiterated that concern. They stated they fully recognize the importance of both the science and compliance aspects of the budget as an integral part of managing and conserving the fisheries resources, but stated that the Commission needs to seriously reconsider options for WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  16    a sustainable Commission budget. FFA members also thanked the Secretariat for the Updated Strategic Plan as it aims to match capacity and capability requirements of developing states and territories with appropriate investment strategies. Related to this, they thanked the contributors to the various funds which SIDS directly benefit from, in particular, the Special Requirements Fund, the Japan Trust Fund, and the Chinese Taipei Trust Fund."
WCPFC18,79,Samoa aligned itself with the statement provided by RMI and FFA members.
WCPFC18,80,WCPFC18 continued to recognise the importance of assessing the impact of proposals on SIDS in accordance with CMM 2013-06.  6.2 Updated Strategic Investment Plan
WCPFC18,81,"The Updated Strategic Investment Plan (WCPFC18-2020-09) was posted on the WCPFC18 ODF (as Topic C), and no comments were received. The Chair noted that the specific purpose of the plan is to match capacity needs and requirements of developing states and territories with appropriate investment strategies."
WCPFC18,82,"The EU reiterated its commitment to a healthy Pacific Ocean and strong and healthy marine resources. It stated that most of the needs identified can be addressed through the EU’s flagship cooperation program — The Pacific-European Union Marine Partnership —which is being implemented by regional organisations, including FFA, SPC, South Pacific Regional Environment Programme, and the University of the South Pacific. The EU stated that WCPFC18-2021-DP06 includes details on the partnership, including activities undertaken from July 2020 to July 2021, and the website contains a full overview of the program since its inception. €1,000,000 has been earmarked to assist FFA members to comply with WCPFC requirements, although no activities have yet been implemented because of COVID-19 restrictions. The EU encouraged FFA members and the WCPFC Secretariat to work together and develop creative ways to use these funds to the benefit of FFA members and CCMs at large."
WCPFC18,83,"Japan stated it fully recognizes the importance of the criteria in CMM 2013-06, and that when submitting a proposal, it carefully looks at the checklist contained in the CMM, and would continue to do so in the future. In this regard, it stated its complete agreement with FFA members that CMM 2013-06 can be effectively addressed by consulting with SIDS, either individually or through FFA. Japan stated it was unfortunate it could not have a physical meeting with FFA and PNA members in 2021 due to COVID-19, but noted it had several virtual consultations with them that were quite useful. Japan stated its strong hope to be able to visit Honiara and Majuro to meet in person in 2022. Japan stated it has been providing SIDS with assistance for infrastructure and capacity building through JICA and OFCF. During 2010 to 2019 Japan provided about ¥200 billion in development assistance to the Pacific islands, which includes fishery-related projects. Fishery-related projects cover conservation and management of highly migratory species and assistance to small-scale fishermen. At the Ninth Pacific Leaders Meeting held virtually in July 2021, Japan announced its commitment to the continuation of its robust development assistance and more than 5,500 people-to-people exchanges and human resource development for the next three years. In 2008 Japan established Japan Trust Fund within WCPFC, which has been assisting capacity building of SIDS for fishery statistics and fishery management. A call for proposals was sent to CCMs on November 15 through Circular No 2021/100. Japan stated its hope that SIDS members would actively consider their applications by the deadline of December 22nd. In addition, Japan has been supporting SIDS since 2008 through the Japan Promotion Fund via OFCF. SIDS can utilize this Fund for various purposes such as enhancement of management capacity. In November 2017, in response to the strong request from SIDS, OFCF signed with FFA to renew the term for another ten years until 2027. Also, in 2020, OFCF increased the size of the WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  17    Promotion Fund. Japan stated its sincere hope that these programs and funds would contribute to fishery development of SIDS."
WCPFC18,84,The Commission noted with appreciation the update provided by the Secretariat on implementation of the Strategic Investment Plan (WCPFC18-2021-09).
WCPFC18,85,The Commission approved the updated 2021 Strategic Investment Plan (Attachment F).   AGENDA ITEM 7  — WCPO TUNA AND BILLFISH STOCKS  7.1  General overview of status of WCPO stocks
WCPFC18,86,"Dr. John Hampton (SPC) presented an overview of the stock status of bigeye, skipjack, South Pacific albacore and yellowfin tuna, including an update on recent events in the fisheries focusing on longline and purse seine activity, and a summary of the stock status of the major species. As references he noted WCPFC18-2021-IP02_rev1 The Western and Central Pacific Tuna Fishery:2020 Overview and Status of Stocks and the WCPFC Tuna Fishery Yearbook 2020."
WCPFC18,87,"The 2020 total catch of about 2.74 million mt was about average for the last decade; the 2020 purse seine catch of 1.88 million mt was also about average, while the longline catch of 217,000 mt was the lowest since 1996 (this figure may increase as more data become available). In the purse seine fishery total catch is dominated by skipjack, and catch has been at a similar level for a decade. Effort has decreased in terms of total fishing days, but has been stable over 6-7 years since a decline from the 2012-2013 level. Purse seine fishing days as measured by VMS indicates 2021 is above average but within the range of the last decade. Regarding purse seine set types, the number of FAD-associated sets has been fairly stable over the past decade; following a large increase in the 2010s the number of unassociated sets has been stable. The total catch by set type is almost equally split between free school and associated sets. The tropical purse seine catch per unit effort (CPUE) has been fairly stable over time, with the average trending up slightly over the last decade; CPUE is generally robust, showing a decline prior to the FAD closure (in 2021). The total longline catch is fairly stable, with a possible slight contraction in the last 15 years. Total longline effort has declined considerably since 2012, stable since then. Examination of VMS longline fishing days for 2021 indicates effort is above average, but within the range of the last 10 years. The tropical longline fishery (20°N–10°S) targets bigeye and yellowfin: reported effort and reported catches of both species are down in 2020, but CPUE was stable in 2020 and over the past decade. In the southern longline fishery, there has been no substantial decline in effort, which is similar to historic highs, and catch has also been maintained at fairly high level, while CPUE is down somewhat. In terms of stock status all stocks are in good condition and WCPO remains only region where all main tuna stocks neither overfished or experiencing overfishing. Regarding spawning biomass depletion, most recent estimates are above the LRP (20% SB/SBF=0) for all four main stocks. Projections (30 year) of SB depletion (which use recent levels of catch and effort) show increasing uncertainty over time because of recruitment uncertainty, but generally remain above the LRP.  The exception was South Pacific albacore, where the risk of falling below the LRP was influenced by a large recruitment uncertainty, which is related to uncertainties associated with the stock assessment. With regard to other species, some are overfished and/or subject to overfishing (Southwest Pacific striped marlin is likely overfished; North Pacific striped marlin, Oceanic Whitetip shark and Pacific bluefin are overfished and subject to overfishing; and Pacific silky shark is not overfished, but is subject to overfishing.) The status of Pacific bigeye thresher shark is inconclusive. The outlook for the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is that fairly strong La Niña conditions will continue for 3-4 months, gradually shifting to neutral ENSO conditions by mid-2022.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  18"
WCPFC18,88,"Kiribati on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau noted that the report indicates the tropical tuna stocks are healthy, and the major tropical fisheries are stable, but that the picture on the other stocks is not so positive. They noted that a single table was shown covering all the shark, billfish, and northern stocks, which was very informative, but not included in the paper. They inquired whether there was reason for that, and if not, could it be included in the paper in future. They also noted the Kobe plot on page 51 for five of those stocks, and inquired whether a Kobe plot could be provided for more of the other stocks? SPC replied that their ability to prepare a Kobe plot for other stocks would depend on the provision of information in the relevant stock assessments, and how uncertainty is expressed, but that this could be considered for future presentations if required."
WCPFC18,89,"The Commission noted the stock status of bigeye, yellowfin, skipjack and South Pacific albacore as presented by the Scientific Services Provider (SPC).  7.2 Bigeye, Skipjack and Yellowfin"
WCPFC18,90,"The Chair noted three issues would be addressed under Agenda Item 7.2: harvest strategy issues, the new tropical tuna measure, and the issue of ‘Other Commercial Fisheries’, which is also relevant to the new tropical tuna CMM. The Chair noted the reference document prepared by the Secretariat: WCPFC18-2021-14. Reference document for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna for the review of CMM 2020-01 and development of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-06. 7.2.1 Harvest Strategy Issues"
WCPFC18,91,"The Chair noted WCPFC18-2021-WP12 by SPC. Recent progress in the technical development of harvest strategies for WCPFC stocks and fisheries (previously presented to SC17 as SC17-MI-WP-03), and observed that the harvest strategy issues would also have bearing on the tropical tuna measure discussions. The Chair noted that the Indicative Work Plan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06, as updated in December 2020, anticipates the Commission would consider at WCPFC18 the advice and information from SC17 and SPC on possible formulations of a TRP for skipjack as well as bigeye and yellowfin, including the results of further analysis requested by SC17 related to the impact of candidate bigeye and yellowfin TRPs on the South Pacific albacore stock. 7.2.1.1 Review of target reference point for skipjack"
WCPFC18,92,"Dr. Graham Pilling (SPC) presented WCPFC18-2021-10 by SPC. Further updates to WCPO skipjack tuna projected stock status to inform consideration of an updated target reference point. The WCPO skipjack tuna assessment agreed to in 2019 incorporated new information on stock biology (e.g., the pattern of maturity-at-length), a new spatial structure, and new model settings. In a similar way to the assessment of WCPO bigeye tuna performed in 2017, this changed the perception of stock status and its productivity compared to the model upon which the decisions on the skipjack interim TRP were based (CMM 2015-06). The paper presents a comparable analysis to that of WCPFC-MOW3-WP-03 (SPC-OFP, 2014), using the agreed 2019 skipjack assessment, and indicates changes in effort and biomass (depletion) from 2012 and recent (2015-2018 average) levels, and median equilibrium yield (as a proportion of MSY) associated with strategies that maintain a median of spawning biomass depletion (SB/SBF=0) at Commission-specified depletion levels. These are compared to the results under 2012 ‘baseline’ fishing levels (2012 effort levels in the purse seine fishery, recent 2016-2018 catch levels in Indonesia/Philippines/Vietnam domestic fisheries). WCPFC17 requested examination of candidate revised interim skipjack TRPs between 36% and 50% of SBF=0, which are presented in the paper. In 2021, the first tropical tuna workshop (TTMW1) requested these analyses also report fishing mortality levels consistent with those % SBF=0 levels, along with the change in biomass (depletion) from 2007-2009 average levels. These are presented in the paper to ensure WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  19    all information is contained in one place. The other information requested by WCPFC16 to aid discussions (paras. 258 and 259 of the WCPFC16 Summary Report), which were reported to previous meetings, are in Annex 3 (formulation of TRPs, impact of effort creep)."
WCPFC18,93,"Under baseline (2012) fishing levels the stock is predicted, on average, to fall slightly compared to ‘recent’ (2015-2018) levels (44% SBF=0), to 42% SBF=0. This is very slightly below 2012 depletion levels but is an equivalent % SBF=0 value at 2 decimal places. Examining the four other median depletion levels requested by WCPFC16 (50%, 48%, 46% and 44% SBF=0), these levels (i) imply reductions in purse seine effort from 2012 levels of 7% to 25%, (ii) lead to predicted increases in spawning biomass from 2012 levels of between 3% and 18%, and either maintain biomass at recent assessed levels, or predict an increase in biomass by 5% to 13%. Total equilibrium yield is predicted to reduce compared to that under 2012 ‘baseline’ levels, to 78%-95% of MSY. For the three median depletion levels requested by WCPFC17 (36%, 38% and 40%), these levels imply increases in purse seine effort from 2012 levels of 5% to 30%, and lead to predicted decreases in spawning biomass from 2012 levels of 5% to 14%. Total equilibrium yield is predicted to increase very slightly compared to that under 2012 ‘baseline’ levels, to 98% of MSY (reaching the flatter peak of the yield curve). There was no risk of falling below the LRP associated with any of these depletion levels based on the current uncertainty framework. To address the request of the TTMW1 for estimated fishing mortality (F) under each candidate depletion level, the paper presents resulting stock-wide age-averaged F for juvenile and adult components of the population and median fishing mortality-at-age. TTMW1 also requested a calculation of recent fishing mortality levels as proportions of 2012 and 2012-2015 levels. Interpretation of the results is challenging given that future fishing mortality is strongly influenced by the required settings within the projection, in particular that future domestic fishery and pole-and-line catches continue at set levels (2016-2018 and 2012 respectively), while purse seine is projected on effort. The composition of gears within the projected fishery and their impacts on the stock will therefore change relative to that in the historical (2012) period. This is clear when examining the relative change in fishing mortality in juvenile and adult segments of the population, with that on juveniles increasing notably at all examined depletion levels. This was driven by significant increases in fishing mortality within Region 5 of the skipjack assessment model (the western tropical WCPO encompassing Indonesia and Philippines), where future domestic fishery catches continue at 2016-2018 levels. SPC noted that a skipjack stock assessment will be undertaken in 2022 and reviewed at SC18."
WCPFC18,94,"Tonga on behalf of FFA members thanked SPC for the analyses and stated it is unfortunate that, for a range of reasons, the Commission has been unable to devote significant time to progressing harvest strategy work over the last two years.  FFA members also noted that over that period they had maintained a clear position on recalibrating the skipjack TRP, noting that the stock is healthy, but some Commission members had been unwilling to support their proposals that would ensure that the target is in line with the current understanding of the status of this stock. FFA members stated their commitment to progressing harvest strategy work in 2022 and beyond, including the adoption of a skipjack TRP in 2022."
WCPFC18,95,"In response to a query from American Samoa, SPC presented figures for the skipjack catch in 2012 vs. 2020, as contained in WCPFC18-2021-IP02_rev1."
WCPFC18,96,"In response to a query from Indonesia, SPC indicated that 50% of skipjack are considered mature at 1 year old, with an estimated size of about 50 cm, and noted that estimated fishing mortality in Region 5 was relatively high in that size range."
WCPFC18,97,"The EU stated that it appears the analyses assume the FAD closures don’t affect the status of skipjack because selectivity is similar, with reduced effort on FADs offset by fishing on free schools, and inquired how confident SPC was in that assumption. The EU noted that despite the decrease in effort, catches have remained at a high level, and inquired whether there was any information on the trend in effort creep in recent years? SPC stated that there were some differences between the analysis presented and those done WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  20    for the tropical tuna CMM. The analysis in the paper assumes patterns of fishing and FAD closures continue into the future. The tropical tuna measure analyses assume there is no major impact from FAD closures on the skipjack population; the impact comes from the number of sets being made, because there are generally similar impacts from free school and FAD-associated sets. Regarding effort creep SPC stated it provides its best estimates every year (in 2021 in SC17-MI-IP-06), but effort creep is not included in the analyses presented to WCPFC18. SPC explained that it does not know what the level of future effort creep will be, and the aim is to define a TRP stock depletion level that meets the Commission’s objectives. Management action must then aim to achieve that TRP, taking into account and adjusting to technology changes within the fishery.  SPC referenced Annex 3 of WCPFC18-2021-10 (Effort creep estimated in relation to the TRPs)."
WCPFC18,98,"PNG, on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau, supported the FFA statement by Tonga. They observed that agreement on a revised skipjack TRP has been held up for 3 years largely because some CCMs tried to take advantage of what should have been a simple technical adjustment to the interim skipjack TRP, and that this was the main reason that MSC certifications of WCPO tuna fisheries faced suspension. The PNA and Tokelau stated they hoped the Commission could give priority to Harvest Strategy work in 2022, including reaching agreement on a skipjack TRP."
WCPFC18,99,"Japan stated it would like to discuss the issue raised by the PNA and Tokelau during WCPFC18, with a goal of reaching an agreement."
WCPFC18,100,The Commission noted the presentation by SPC and advice from SC17 on possible formulations of a TRP for skipjack tuna.
WCPFC18,101,The Commission noted the importance of agreeing on TRP for skipjack and agreed to progress this work in 2022.  7.2.1.2 Target reference point for bigeye and yellowfin
WCPFC18,102,"Dr. Steven Hare (SPC) presented WCPFC18-2021-11. Updated WCPO bigeye and yellowfin TRP evaluations. In 2020, SC16 agreed on new stock assessments for WCPO bigeye and yellowfin tuna that indicated both stocks are on average not overfished nor subject to overfishing. Based on those assessments, the paper presents results of analyses requested by SC16, WCPFC16 and SC17, to assist WCPFC18 in the identification of interim TRPs for WCPO bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks. It presents the consequences for each stock and fishery of SC16-defined stock depletion levels (SB/SBF=0) consistent with specified historical conditions and stock risk levels (paras. 76–78 of the SC16 Outcomes Document). For each depletion level, results are presented comparable to those in WCPFC-SC16-2020/MI-WP-02 for skipjack tuna, indicating changes in biomass from both 2012-2015 and recent (2015-2018 average) levels, changes in fishing from baseline (2016-2018 average) levels, median equilibrium yield (as a proportion of MSY), risk relative to the agreed LRP, and SC16-requested per-recruit metrics. Full results are summarised in the tables in WCPFC18-2021-11. In response to a request from WCPFC17, additional analyses were conducted to facilitate examination of the multi-species implications of harvest levels that achieve the different TRPs for each species (yellowfin and bigeye under the two recruitment assumptions). The resultant depletion levels for skipjack and yellowfin (under bigeye TRP calculations), and for skipjack and bigeye (under yellowfin TRP calculations) are computed and provided. Within this analysis both the overall purse seine effort and longline catch is increased or decreased by the scalar specified; this is a different assumption to that of (for example) the evaluation of the tropical tuna CMM for skipjack, where overall purse seine effort is assumed to remain constant. SC17 requested that the potential consequences of the candidate TRPs for South Pacific albacore depletion be examined, and these are presented. Outcomes for skipjack and South Pacific albacore are provided in the main text of the paper.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  21"
WCPFC18,103,"Dr. Hare stated that under baseline (2016-2018 average) fishing conditions, both bigeye and yellowfin stocks were projected to increase relative to 2012-2015 average levels, and either remain at recent (2015-2018 average) levels (yellowfin) or increase (bigeye). For both bigeye and yellowfin, CMM 2020-01 specifies that, pending agreement on a TRP, the spawning biomass depletion ratio (SB/SBF=0) is to be maintained at or above the average SB/SBF=0 for 2012-2015. Achieving that depletion level for bigeye implied increases in fishing from 2016-2018 levels by 38% (assuming recent recruitment) and 22% (assuming long-term recruitment) and resulted in a risk of falling below the limit reference point (LRP) of 3% or 14% (recent and long-term recruitment, respectively). For yellowfin, it implied increased fishing by 29%, and no calculated risk of falling below the LRP. The implications of achieving depletion levels +/- 10% from the 2012-2015 average levels are presented in the tables. An alternative SC16-specified candidate reference point was equivalent to 2000-2004 average depletion levels. For bigeye, this depletion level required fishing to be reduced by 4% (recent recruitment) or 17% (long-term recruitment), and resulted in no, or a minimal (1% assuming long-term recruitment patterns), risk of falling below the LRP. For yellowfin, 2000-2004 average depletion levels implied increasing fishing by 34% from baseline levels, and there was no risk of falling below the LRP calculated at that level. Final SC16-specified depletion levels related to those equivalent to a 10% and 20% risk of falling below the LRP. For bigeye, this implied increases in fishing by 55% and 70% (recent recruitment) and 12% and 33% (long-term recruitment), respectively. Under recent recruitments, those risk levels were achieved at stock sizes 12%-23% lower than 2012-2015 levels. Under the less productive long-term recruitment assumption those risk levels implied a 6% less depleted stock and 10% more depleted stock respectively, relative to 2012-2015 average depletion. For yellowfin, 200% greater fishing than baseline levels (a scalar of 3) was required to achieve a 10% risk level; this was considered unrealistic, and a 20% risk-based depletion level was therefore not pursued further for this stock."
WCPFC18,104,"Dr. Hare noted that with reference to the risk-related depletion levels, which represent ‘minimum’ TRP values consistent with those risk levels, the choice of a TRP can be based on a combination of biological, ecological, and socio-economic considerations, which would likely imply higher TRP levels than the ‘minimum’ TRPs calculated. As agreed at SC16, within this analysis purse seine effort and longline catch are ‘scaled’ equally relative to baseline levels. Scalars are applied to overall purse seine effort – i.e., both associated and unassociated sets are increased or decreased, with the relative pattern reflecting that over the 2016-2018 baseline period. Results will therefore generally differ from that in the CMM 2018-01 evaluation that was presented to WCPFC17 (WCPFC17-2020-14_rev 1). SPC noted that candidate TRP levels can be achieved under different combinations of future purse seine and longline catch/effort levels, which will have implications for the other metrics calculated. If desired, identification of a limited subset of candidate interim TRP levels is strongly recommended before that style of analysis is undertaken. As noted in previous papers discussing TRP formulation, there is a need to have specific language defining the TRP level, based upon the management objective that the TRP is designed to achieve. That language needs to be suitably specific so that the TRP can be recalculated in the case that in the future, new biological or fishery knowledge leads to an updated perception of stock status from the stock assessments. The new information incorporated within the 2020 yellowfin tuna stock assessment implies a more robust stock than estimated previously, as seen by the minimal risks of falling below the LRP identified at the levels identified here. SPC noted that key areas for further work on the yellowfin assessment were identified for 2022, and an external review of the assessment is also planned (WCPFC-SC17-WP-06). While the assessment is viewed as the best scientific information currently available, the further work underway may lead to changes in the perception of stock status and robustness."
WCPFC18,105,"The USA noted the updated analyses, including the new information on the multispecies impacts. It stated that given the differing interests of CCMs in the tropical tuna fisheries and the sometimes very different operational characteristics of their respective fisheries, a reasonable starting point — and perhaps end point — for developing TRPs is to create an appropriate buffer for the LRP.  In other words, it makes sense to focus on the risk of breaching the LRP rather than, for example, arbitrary time periods. Given that, WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  22    and recalling the Commission’s decision that LRP risk levels as high as 20% are consistent with the Convention’s requirement that the risk be “very low,” the USA suggested that LRP risk levels of 10% would constitute appropriate LRPs for both bigeye and yellowfin, and supported their adoption, understanding that important work would remain to operationalize them, as the TRPs would compete with each other. It noted that LRP risk levels could be translated into stock sizes, exploitation rates, or other measures, but stated that there is little reason to do so, and expressing the TRPs solely in terms of LRP risk levels would obviate the need to periodically recalibrate the TRPs if they are expressed in other measures like stock size. The USA stated it was prepared to move forward and adopt TRPs for these two stocks as it had proposed."
WCPFC18,106,"Cook Islands, on behalf of FFA members, thanked SPC and noted the 2020 yellowfin tuna stock assessment implies a more robust stock than estimated previously. They acknowledged that due to uncertainty in this stock assessment an external review is planned for 2022, and further work is underway that may lead to changes in the perception of stock status and robustness. FFA members stated the updates were very timely as they facilitate an improved understanding of multi-species implications of alternative harvest levels, presenting for the first time the resultant depletion levels for skipjack, yellowfin and South Pacific albacore under bigeye tuna TRP calculations, and for skipjack, bigeye and South Pacific albacore under yellowfin tuna TRP calculations. They stated this would greatly aid in considering candidate TRPs for bigeye and yellowfin tuna. FFA members stated that the decision on TRPs for these stocks is critical and has major implications for the management of WCPFC fisheries. FFA members noted that yellowfin and bigeye are central stocks for FFA members, important in both purse seine and longline fisheries, and having a clear understanding of the trade-offs associated with potential TRPs is essential; unfortunately given the ongoing impacts of COVID on the business of the Commission, and the major time and effort that has been consumed renegotiating the tropical tuna measure, FFA members stated that they have not been able to devote the time and energy to properly consider these decisions, and have not been able to undertake the consultation with other WCPFC members that would be necessary to reach consensus."
WCPFC18,107,The Commission noted the presentation by SPC of the results of analyses on candidate TRPs for bigeye and yellowfin.
WCPFC18,108,The Commission noted the importance of agreeing on TRP for bigeye and yellowfin and agreed to progress this work in 2022.  7.2.1.3 Management procedures for skipjack
WCPFC18,109,The Chair noted that two reference papers had been prepared: WCPFC18-2021-13. SPC. Evaluations of candidate management procedures for skipjack tuna in the WCPO; and WCPFC18-2021-12.
WCPFC18,110,"In light of the need to prioritise discussion on the new tropical tuna measure, CCMs agreed to defer consideration of candidate management procedures for skipjack."
WCPFC18,111,The Commission agreed to defer consideration of management procedures for skipjack until 2022.  7.2.2 Proposed New Measure for Tropical Tuna
WCPFC18,112,"The Chair prefaced consideration of the tropical tuna CMM at WCPFC18 by noting the work done during 2021, including two workshops on Development of a New WCPFC Tropical Tuna Measure WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  23    (Workshop 1, held 26–30 April, and the associated Chair’s Report of TTMW1; and  Workshop 2, held 6–10 September, and the associated Chair’s Report of TTMW2). The workshops provided an opportunity to clarify CCMs’ views on many elements of the tropical tuna measure, and resulted in a number of requests being made of the SSP for further analyses; results of these analyses are summarised in WCPFC18-2021-15 (addressed under Agenda Item 7.2.2.1). Statements and proposals offered by CCMs at the workshops are posted on the WCPFC18 meeting pages as WCPFC-TTMW1-2021-DP01 through WCPFC-TTMW1-2021-DP06, and WCPFC-TTMW2-2021-DP01 through WCPFC-TTMW2-2021-DP03). Subsequently, the Chair prepared a Consultative Draft for the new tropical tuna CMM (Circular 2021/82, dated 01 October 2021). Following submission of comments by a number of CCMs, a revised Consultative Draft was issued on 01 November 2021 (Circular 2021/94), and issued as WCPFC18-2021-16. WCPFC Chair. Chair’s Consultative Draft CMM for Tropical Tunas."
WCPFC18,113,"The Chair noted that the November Consultative Draft reflected written comments received from the United States of America, Japan, Chinese Taipei, Korea, the European Union, FFA (representing Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu), and the SPG (Cook Islands, Fiji, Niue, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu). Given the substantive and valuable nature of the comments from CCMs, and for the purposes of transparency, the Secretariat posted all the comments received on the October Consultative Draft to the WCPFC18 meeting page (WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP01 through WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP09)."
WCPFC18,114,"The Chair outlined the approach taken in including CCMs’ comments in the Consultative Draft, and highlighted the key elements:  • Bigeye and Skipjack management objectives • Addition of a spatial element • FAD closures and FAD-related elements (e.g., instrumented buoys and non-entangling FADs) • Timeframe for decisions on allocation • Longline MCS measures • Longline catch limits • Purse seine high seas effort limits • Other commercial fisheries • Operational data"
WCPFC18,115,"At the request of the Chair, the Commission’s consideration of the tropical tuna CMM at WCPFC18 began with statements from CCMs that had prepared written submissions in response to the Chair’s November Consultative Draft.  Introductory statements from CCMs"
WCPFC18,116,"The EU welcomed the transparent and inclusive approach adopted by the Chair, and focussed on the following suggestions to improve and strengthen the measure. (i) The EU suggested a revision in Paragraph 4, requiring that if coastal states adopt measures in archipelagic waters and territorial seas that are consistent with the CMM they inform the Secretariat of the relevant measure. The EU noted that this would allow the Commission to have a full picture of how tropical tuna fisheries are regulated and managed across the WCPFC-CA.  (ii) The EU suggested an addition to Paragraph 8 to clarify the issue of attribution of catch for purse seine vessels under charter arrangements, with the aim to ensure that the exemptions under Footnote 1 cannot be used by vessels flagged to non-SIDS under chartering arrangements, which the EU stated WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  24    in this specific case do not seem to provide any benefit to SIDS. The EU stated that this would remove an existing loophole from the management framework and facilitate the work of TCC.  (iii) With regard to FAD management, to facilitate discussions at TCC and clarify the use of the exemptions under Footnote 1, the EU suggested an addition to paragraph 16 that would require that the Secretariat provides at the end of each fishing season a list of fishing vessels that have not applied the FAD closure in that specific fishing season.  (iv) The EU also proposed the adoption of  fully non-entangling FADs by banning the use of mesh net from the FAD, as this would eliminate the threat of ghost fishing from FADs, and suggested that the language and commitment regarding the move to introduce biodegradable FADs be more ambitious; regarding the monitoring of instrumented buoys, the EU proposed adding a reporting requirement to allow the Secretariat to assess compliance and ensure SPC receives the information for its scientific work aiming at improving FAD management.  (v) Regarding high seas purse seine effort, the EU supported retention of Table 2 in Attachment 1, noting high seas purse seine effort of CCMs not bound under the current measure has been increasing. The EU suggested that a temporary cap to that additional component of the high seas purse seine effort be added for the duration of the current CMM. This would be a collective 3,000 days to be allocated among SIDS CCMs. This would ensure that all components of tropical tuna fishing mortality are effectively managed in the framework of the CMM.  (vi) The EU also suggested that catch retention provisions be adopted for longline and other commercial fisheries, to mirror those already in place for the purse seine fleet; this would concern the three tropical tuna species.  (vii) The EU also proposed inclusion of a “no data, no fish” to prohibit CCMs that do not provide their list of active vessels and the catch and effort data required by the Commission, in accordance with WCPFC reporting requirements, for one or more species for a given year, from retaining such species as of the year following."
WCPFC18,117,"Chinese Taipei stated that for the general provisions its goal is that in the long run the Commission removes all exemptions, noting that all CCMs should make contributions to conserve the species; it stated that there may be a need for special arrangements in the short term, but the purpose of these should be clarified. Chinese Taipei made the following comments regarding specific elements of the CMM. (i) For purse seine fisheries: regarding FADs, Chinese Taipei stated it would like to revise the 1 nautical mile (nm) rule to 0.5 nm. Chinese Taipei also stated it sought to retain the current “small garbage” provisions, which are very important for the MCS. Regarding biodegradable and non-entangling FADs, Chinese Taipei supported continuation of the discussion on these issues through the FAD-MO SWG.  (ii) Regarding the longline fisheries, Chinese Taipei noted the need to rebalance the current tropical tuna measure by increasing the longline bigeye catch limit, as the longline fishery has sacrificed more than other fisheries.  (iii) Chinese Taipei also stated that the Commission should take onboard the advice from TCC and SC on other commercial fisheries."
WCPFC18,118,"Fiji on behalf of FFA members stated they would not consider any changes to the CMM that affects the current careful balance of interests between fisheries and CCMs, which they stated has been achieved after a lengthy period of careful and considered development. FFA members stated that if there are to be changes within the CMM, the rationale for those proposed changes needs to be compelling and the balance needs to be maintained. FFA members stated they take the advice of SC very seriously and insist on a cautious approach to any changes to the existing measures. They also noted that, following SC’s significant technical concerns, there will be an independent review in 2022 of the stock assessments for bigeye and yellowfin tuna; until the outcomes of this review are available any revisions to the CMM need to be suitably precautionary. Based on these criteria, FFA members stated that they had proposed a number of carefully WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  25    considered changes to the CMM that have been included in the Chair’s Consultative Draft. The FFA proposals include requirements for the use of non-entangling materials in FAD construction as well as a re-specification of the timeframes for the Commission’s consideration of allocation frameworks for high seas limits for both purse seine and longline fisheries, and recognition of the management arrangements applied by FFA members to manage the fishing activity taking place within their EEZs. FFA members stated that the Commission has an opportunity to address one of the key gaps in the Commission’s management frameworks: the lack of effective monitoring of high seas fishing activity by longline vessels. FFA members stated they seek to include a range of MCS elements for longline fisheries in the new tropical tuna measure, with firm commitments to progress these, which they stated are essential for addressing the gap in monitoring of longline activity, particularly on the high seas. FFA members stated that most importantly, and in recognition of their sovereign rights under international law, longline fishing within their EEZs would be managed only through zone-based management, including the LL-VDS, which is currently applied by PNA members plus Tokelau. FFA members also emphasised the ultimate intention, as proposed in the text provided in relation to paragraph 44 of the revised CMM, to transition towards an equitable framework for allocation of high seas fishing opportunities in the bigeye longline fishery. Finally, recognising the United Nations’ Climate Change Sustainable Development Goal to “take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”, and that climate change has particularly negative impacts on SIDS, FFA members suggested climate change be included in the preamble to the measure in acknowledgment of the impact of climate change on fisheries, and the disproportionate consequences on the region."
WCPFC18,119,"Japan observed that in the WCPFC-CA many types of fishing gear are used to target tuna species, and that the CMM should take into account the interest and balance of these different fisheries. Japan noted that while the 2020 bigeye stock assessment indicated the biological status of the stock is healthy, the recent biomass levels are insufficient for some fisheries that rely on these stocks. The CPUE of Japan’s longline fishery, whose main target is bigeye tuna, has deceased in recent years, with poor catch.  Japan maintained its position that the TRP for bigeye should be set as median SB/SBF=0 for 2000-2004. For the skipjack TRP Japan stated its understanding that this was agreed in accordance with the recommendation from SC10 in 2014 that the Commission take action to limit further increases in fishing mortality and keep the skipjack stock around the (then) current level. Japan stated that from this point of view selection of 2012 as a reference year as proposed by FFA was acceptable; Japan stated it could consider the FFA proposal positively and work with FFA and others on this issue. Regarding Charter arrangements, Japan stated that the provision of the current paragraph leaves room for interpretation, and to avoid future disputes among CCMs Japan advocated revising the text to clearly reflect the understanding of CCMs, especially the distinction between high seas and EEZs where non-SIDS vessels are chartered by SIDS. Regarding FAD management, while Japan stated it agreed on the direction to strengthen the regulation on non-entangling FAD, Japan requested that a transition period be established so that purse seiners could prepare non-entangling FADs compliant with the paragraph. Japan supported development of biodegradable FADs, and suggested the need to define “biodegradable” in this context. Regarding management of longline fisheries, Japan noted FFA’s proposed revisions regarding bigeye catch limits, and suggested the goal of moving to zone-based management be discussed, with a view to reaching agreement in 2023. In closing Japan noted again that bigeye tuna are caught by many different vessels in its EEZ, and indicated its interest in addressing these issues with other CCMs as both a coastal and distant water fishing nation."
WCPFC18,120,"Korea offered comments on the following key issues. Regarding management objectives for bigeye and yellowfin, Korea stated that if the current objectives are retained it expects there will be some increases in fishing opportunities, based on advice from SPC and various socioeconomic factors. For skipjack, SPC has presented several options, which Korea stated should be discussed by CCMs. Regarding FAD management, Korea stated the need to address the issue of fishers’ unknowingly setting on FADs during FAD closures, which is related to the FAD definition and the 1 nm rule. Korea stated that with respect to the high seas limit for purse seine fisheries, at present some CCMs must reduce their purse seine fishing effort in the high seas by 80% to 90% from historical levels, while others fish with no limits. Koreas stated WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  26    that this is not equitable and likely to undermine purse seine effort control in the high seas and must be rectified. Korea stated its expectation that overall bigeye catch limit for longline fisheries would be increased, and hoped that the Commission could identify an appropriate level of increase. Korea also noted that there are some provisions that exempt SIDS from these requirements, and stated that the Commission needs to pursue a careful balance of the special requirements of SIDS with the need to conserve tuna stocks."
WCPFC18,121,"Niue on behalf of the SPG stated that as SIDS they share strong interests in the sustainable development of the southern longline fisheries for southern albacore, swordfish, bigeye and yellowfin. They noted that SPG members had previously highlighted the need to ensure that the longline provisions of the tropical tuna CMM recognise the sovereign rights of coastal States to manage fishing activity within their EEZs, in accordance with the provisions of the WCPFC and UNCLOS. They stated that any vessel fishing in SPG waters should be managed under their management framework, including any applicable limits, in the same manner that any catch taken in their waters is attributed to the coastal State. The SPG stated it prioritised the development by WCPFC of zone-based management for all longline fisheries, and looked forward to working with other CCMs in developing sustainable and equitable limits that respect rights for the high seas and coastal State sovereign rights for EEZs. They strongly supported the retention of paragraph 44 of the current CMM, including the amendments proposed by FFA, and advocated that WCPFC19 determine hard high seas limits for bigeye in 2022, and apply those limits to CCMs in a manner consistent with their sovereign rights, and Articles 8, 10 (3) and 30 of the Convention. SPG members stated their deep concern about the continuing decline in South Pacific albacore fisheries, and the impact of this on fisheries-dependent economies, noting that the southern fisheries interact with the tropical longline fisheries, and are impacted by changes in tropical longline management, activities and catches. SPG stated it is critical to avoid any increase in longline fishing effort, or increase in bigeye limits, noting that any such increase, particularly south of the equator, would result in additional catches of albacore and place a disproportionate burden on SPG members. Such increases may also result in fleet behavioural changes that could negatively impact on southern longline fisheries. As a result, SPG advocated that the CMM not allow for any overall increase in longline fishing effort, or any overall increase in bigeye limits, stressing that any proposal to increase tropical longline fishing effort, or any overall increase in bigeye longline limits, must consider impacts on SIDs and territories as per CMM 2013-06. SPG stated it would also be seeking further study on the interactions and impacts of longline fishing effort on their southern longline fisheries, and an immediate freeze on albacore catch from the high seas."
WCPFC18,122,"The USA stated that as it made clear in 2020 and through the intersessional work in 2021, it is critical that the CMM be substantially revised at WCPFC18 to address continuing shortcomings. The USA put forward a number of specific suggestions to the TTMW1 and TTMW2, and followed up with specific proposals and views as reflected in the Chair’s consultative draft CMM. The USA highlighted the most important comments and proposals it provided, as contained in WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP02. (i) The USA noted that paragraph 5 speaks to the rights and obligations of SIDS and territories, and that each provision of the new CMM must be considered in light of the special requirements of ALL SIDS, including participating territories.  Therefore, the USA stated that the specific paragraphs cited in paragraph 5 should be subject to change as the details of the new CMM are discussed. (ii) The USA stated it is important to retain Paragraph 9, which speaks to agreements between U.S.-flagged vessels and U.S. participating territories.  The USA stated the importance of this provision, and how it serves the development aspirations of American Samoa, CNMI, and Guam, are described in WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP09, which points to specific fisheries development activities that have resulted from these agreements. (iii) The USA offered specific language for the management objectives for each of the three stocks, in paragraphs 12-14: (a) For all three tropical tuna stocks, the USA believes it is crucially important for the Commission to recognize and avoid the risk of severe localized spawning stock depletion.  With that in mind, WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  27    it proposed that each of the stock-wide objectives be supplemented with the phrase “and excessive spatial unevenness in spawning biomass depletion is to be avoided to support thriving fisheries throughout the Convention Area. (b) For skipjack tuna, the USA commented is that the TRP itself should not be specified in this CMM, but elsewhere, as is done with other reference points. (iv) Regarding paragraphs 16-17 (FAD closures) the USA stated it sees the need to keep the bigeye-directed controls in the purse seine fishery similar in effect to those in the existing measure. However, the USA stressed the Commission cannot continue to adopt measures that rely on observers to ensure compliance until it resolves the issues relating the sharing of observer reports between ROP Providers and CCMs that need them for investigations. The USA stated that for that reason, it could not support inclusion of FAD closures or limits on FAD sets without a clear understanding that progress is being made to resolve the observer report issue.   (v) The USA stated it had commented on exemptions to the FAD closures, currently in Footnotes 1 and 2, observing that these exemptions have served their purpose of facilitating the development of certain members’ purse seine fisheries, and that it was time to end these. It stated that if agreement could be reached to remove the exemptions at WCPFC18, then the Commission must review the impacts of the FAD closures among CCMs and revisit the exemptions to ensure the closures do not result in a disproportionate burden of conservation action on any SIDS, including participating territories. It stated that in particular, the tuna-dependent economy of American Samoa is being significantly adversely impacted by the closures and their uneven application. (vi) The USA stated it had not provided specific comments on the purse seine fishing effort limits in paragraphs 25 and 26 and Table 1 and 2 of Attachment 1, but would offer drafting suggestions to suit the needs of CCMs, including all SIDS.   (vii) For monitoring and control in the longline fishery, the USA proposed increasing the minimum level of observer coverage in all longline fisheries from 5% to 10%, effective January 1, 2023, noting that increased coverage in the longline fishery is clearly needed to meet the scientific and compliance needs of the Commission. (viii) Regarding the longline bigeye tuna catch limits in paragraph 39, the USA supported adding limits for all CCMs that are not currently limited, and increases to some of the existing limits in Table 3 of Attachment 1. It noted that some members’ catch limits had been severely underused since they were adopted, and stated that the proposed changes would constitute an increase of 12,000 mt in the limits collectively, slightly more than those annual underages. It stated that the revised limits, even if fully utilized, would keep the spawning stock well above the level in the existing management objective and presented a very low (close-to-zero) risk of breaching the LRP.   (ix) The USA stated that Paragraph 44 calls for the Commission to agree on hard limits for bigeye and a framework to allocate those limits among all Members and Participating Territories.  It stated that if the Commission was unable to establish longline bigeye tuna limits for all CCMs at this meeting, the USA would support retention of this paragraph with some adjustments. It stated it would be open to revisions that recognize FFA members’ interest in incorporating a zone-based aspect into the Commission’s management of the longline fishery for bigeye tuna, but that the task set forth in this paragraph must not be narrowed to just the high seas. Second, the USA supported revisions that recognize the need to avoid localized spawning biomass depletion and the utility of a spatially tailored management scheme to do so. It noted that this concept of spatially-based management was not in conflict with the FFA members’ desire to shift to a zone-based management scheme. (x) The USA noted its companion paper, WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP09, was submitted on behalf of American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the United States and served two purposes, both related to CCM’s collective obligation to ensure that CMMs do not transfer a disproportionate burden of conservation onto any SIDS, including participating territories: (a) it provides information about the fisheries and economies of the three U.S. territories, which the USA stated could be used by the Commission to help assess impacts of CMMs generally on these three SIDS; and (b) contains information about the expected impacts on SIDS of particular WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  28    provisions that have been proposed by the USA, as well as of provisions proposed or promoted by other CCMs. It noted that the information was presented using the CMM 2013-06 assessment framework."
WCPFC18,123,"American Samoa emphasized the overwhelming dependence of American Samoa on the tuna industry, which provides 84% of its private employment and accounts for more than 99% of the value of its exports. It stated that its economy is suffering from the unintended consequences of the tuna measure, one of which is reflagging, noting that U.S.-flagged vessels have been moving to other flags in pursuit of better economic and operating conditions. American Samoa stated that many of the vessels that have left the U.S. flag are now flagged to Pacific Island countries that do not have high seas limits and that exempt their vessels from the FAD closures; as a result, port calls to Pago Pago have greatly diminished. In addition, vessels are fishing farther from American Samoa, in waters where they don’t have to pay for access and where they are not subject to limits or FAD closures. Those more distant fishing grounds make American Samoa less attractive for unloading. American Samoa stated that reduced port calls impact the supply of tuna to its cannery and damage its tuna-dependent economy. It stated that each purse seiner’s direct delivery to Pago Pago represents spending of about $400,000 for fuel, food, supplies, repairs and services, but direct deliveries are down almost 50% from 2020, which was a direct loss to the economy of over $10 million for 2021 alone, not counting what the canneries lost due to reduced production and lost sales. In four of the last six years, the high seas in the WCPFC-CA were closed to U.S. vessels as a result of reaching the limit on fishing effort. American Samoa stated that because its cannery depends so strongly on U.S.-flagged vessels, the consequences of those closures have been enormous. The economic losses in American Samoa from the closure in 2015 alone were estimated at $11 million to $110 million. In addition to the loss in commerce, represented by what the boats spend, is the loss of raw material; American Samoa stated that all tuna processors require an economical and reliable source of tuna in order to be viable, which it had that with its locally based fleet of purse seiners. It stated that the decimation of the locally based tuna purse seine fleet threatens to destroy the tuna industry, and the loss of the locally based purse seiner fleet would result in American Samoa losing its reliable and economical raw material supply, and one of the main reasons the tuna processing industry exists in American Samoa. It stated that in summary, the existing measure is seriously unfair for American Samoa, is not working well, and needs to be changed. It stated that in developing a new tuna measure, the Commission must recognize the special requirements and interests of American Samoa as a SIDS that is highly dependent on tuna resources, noting that the Commission has a clear responsibility in this regard under Article 30 of the Convention, and that it was time for the Commission to fulfil that responsibility with respect to American Samoa."
WCPFC18,124,"PNG on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau supported the FFA position in advocating a precautionary approach to changes to the current measures in the CMM, and supported the FFA position to maintain the current careful balance of interests between fisheries and CCMs in the CMM. They stated that this was substantially based around the agreement on bigeye conservation that was made in Busan to reduce longline catch limits by 30% and apply a 3 months FAD closure. Despite the heavy costs and increasingly disproportionate burden of the FAD closure, PNA and Tokelau stated they supported maintaining the current FAD closure as part of taking a precautionary approach to the development of the new CMM, provided the integrity of the current FAD closure arrangements is maintained, and the other elements of the package of measures that conserve bigeye are also maintained, including the longline bigeye catch limits, the high seas FAD closure and the high seas purse seine effort limits. They stressed that longline bigeye catch limits are part of the package of measures to conserve bigeye, and if increases in longline bigeye catch limits are to be considered, the FAD closure would need to be reduced or removed; zone-based management, including the longline VDS, would need to be implemented as proposed by the FFA-suggested revision to paragraph 39; and longline MCS would need to be strengthened.   WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  29    Tropical Tuna Measure Deliberations"
WCPFC18,125,"Following the presentation of CCMs’ introductory statements, and consideration of related issues, for example the status of WCPO tuna stocks (Agenda Item 7.1), the setting of TRPs (7.2.1.1-7.2.1.2), SPC’s analyses relevant to the tropical tuna measure (7.2.2.1), and the report of the FAD-MO IWG (7.2.2.2), the Commission considered the tropical tuna measure at WCPFC18 in the course of a number of discussion sessions in plenary as well as three closed meetings among the Heads of Delegations. CCMs agreed that significant changes to the core elements of the measure, involving FAD closures, high seas purse seine effort control, longline MCS measures, and longline bigeye catch limits, would be necessarily made in conjunction (as a “package”)."
WCPFC18,126,"In the course of their discussions CCMs agreed to retain those elements of the current measure for which there was a lack of consensus regarding proposed revisions. This decision was made following significant deliberation, and was supported by CCMs in view of: • ongoing efforts to develop harvest strategies for the main tuna stocks;  • the acknowledged success of CMM 2020-01 and its predecessors in meeting the Commission’s objectives with regard to maintaining their objectives for these stocks; and  • the complexity of the negotiations regarding the central package of elements in the CMM, particularly given the challenges of the virtual meeting format."
WCPFC18,127," The succeeding paragraphs provide a summary of views offered by CCMs on significant elements of the CMM, and the consensus reached by the Commission with respect to those elements in its development of CMM 2021-01.    Charter Measures"
WCPFC18,128,"A number of CCMs argued for retention of the existing charter measures, noting these provide coastal states with opportunities to develop their domestic fisheries in partnership with distant water fishing nations. A CCM supported addressing whether the chartering arrangements could be the opportunity for non-SIDS to make use of the benefits granted to SIDS. Differing views were expressed over retention of a paragraph attributing the catches and efforts of United States flagged vessels operating under agreements with its participating territories to those territories. Consensus was not reached on revisions to these elements, so the existing CMM’s charter provisions were not substantially revised.  Interim objectives for bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin tuna"
WCPFC18,129,"Some CCMs argued for retention of the current objectives for bigeye and yellowfin, noting the need to maintain a precautionary approach pending establishment of TRPs for these species, and the outcomes of the yellowfin stock assessment review being conducted in 2022. A number of CCMs also referenced ongoing efforts to transition to a harvest strategy approach to these stocks and advocated against expending significant effort to revise the existing objectives. Some CCMs suggested the skipjack TRP be modified in line with recent scientific advice, or deleted. A number of CCMs stated that despite their reluctance to extending the current skipjack TRP, they would agree to do so given the lack of time, and need to reach agreement on the CMM as a whole. One CCM advocated adopting a spatial approach to objectives for these stocks that reflects spatial differences in exploitation patterns. Consideration was also given to deletion of the objectives for all three stocks. Consensus was not reached on revisions to these elements, and the existing CMM’s interim objectives for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna were not revised.    WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  30    Purse Seine Fishery FAD Closures"
WCPFC18,130,"CCMs agreed that, in the absence of changes to other essential elements of the CMM, the FAD closures would be retained. All CCMs agreed regarding the importance of the FAD closures as a core conservation element of the current tropical tuna CMM, while some CCMs expressed concern regarding the difficulties in enforcing this aspect of the CMM given that it relies on observer reports, and noting that issues related to access by Flag States to observer reports were related to a significant number of the unresolved cases in the CCFS."
WCPFC18,131,"The USA proposed that the following language be included in the CMM in order to address this issue:  “Recognizing that ensuring compliance with the FAD closures depends on ROP observers and the reports they prepare, WCPFC18 agrees that continuation of the provisions of paragraphs 16 and 17 of the new tropical tuna measure (CMM 2021-XX) after 2022 is dependent on the Commission resolving the problems associated with observer reports being shared in timely manner among CCMs for investigations.  Paragraphs 16 and 17 will cease to be in effect on 1 January 2023 until the Commission adopts specific elements that are to be included in the WCPFC observer reports that are provided by ROP Providers to CCMs for investigations and requirements on the timing of such provision.”"
WCPFC18,132,"Other CCMs stated that while they understood the linkages between the provision of observer reports and the FAD closure element of the tropical tuna CMM, including such a sunset clause in the measure posed an unacceptable risk. A number of CCMs supported inclusion of the following language to reflect the need to address the issue:  “TCC18 will undertake work on the elements of the WCPFC observer report to be provided by ROP Providers to CCMs for investigations.”"
WCPFC18,133,"No consensus was reached, and the issue of provision of observer reports with respect to FAD closures is not addressed in the revised CMM.   FAD Closure Exemptions (Footnote 1)"
WCPFC18,134,"Several CCMs voiced strong support for modifying Footnote 1 (to paragraph 16 in CMM 2020-01) so as to apply to all SIDS, including territories, with a view to addressing the economic hardship experienced by American Samoa, as referenced in WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP02 and WCPFC18-2021-TTM-DP09. CCMs recognized and sympathized with the economic difficulties faced by American Samoa, and considered a range of approaches to address the issue, including exemptions from the 3-month FAD closure in the U.S. EEZ and the 2-month FAD closure in the high seas for U.S. flagged vessels notified as an integral part of American Samoa’s fishery. Most CCMs stressed the importance of ensuring any exemption treated all SIDS equally, and generally advocated that any exemption apply only to that portion of the U.S. EEZ surrounding American Samoa. No consensus was reached on these proposals, and they are not included in the revised CMM.  Non-entangling FADs"
WCPFC18,135,"CCMs agreed on the importance of reducing the risk of entanglement of sharks, sea turtles and other species in FADs, and incorporated language in CMM 2021-01 prohibiting (as from January 1, 2024) the use of mesh net for any part of a FAD, and requiring the use of non-entangling materials. CCMs agreed on the desirability of using biodegradable materials, and on the need for additional research, and directed SC to WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  31    review research on the use of biodegradable materials on FADs, and to provide specific recommendations related to biodegradable FADs to the Commission in 2022. CCMs also agreed to consider adoption of measures on the implementation of biodegradable FADs at WCPFC20. Instrumented buoys"
WCPFC18,136,"CCMs agreed to retain the existing limit on the number of drifting FADs with activated instrumented buoys, while acknowledging that the impact of the limit (on both reducing the amount of marine debris and controlling the use of FADs) was uncertain, and agreed to review the effectiveness and appropriateness of the limit at WCPFC20, based on consideration of these issues by the FADMO IWG. CCMs also agreed to include elements in the CMM encouraging vessels to responsibly manage the number of drifting FADs deployed, and to take steps to address lost drifting FADs.  Purse seine effort control"
WCPFC18,137,"CCMs agreed on the need to establish hard effort or catch limits in the high seas of the WCPFC-CA and agreed to commence a process to develop that framework in 2022, to enable reaching agreement in 2023.  Longline fishery  Improved monitoring and control"
WCPFC18,138,"Most CCMs agreed on the importance of improving monitoring and control with respect to the longline fishery. A number of approaches were discussed, including requirements to: • provide notification to the Commission prior to entry into and exit from the high seas;  • submit operational level catch and effort data through electronic means; • establish a regional electronic monitoring programme; and • increase the minimum level of observer coverage in longline fisheries from 5% to 10%.  A variety of positions were expressed on these proposals, but CCMs failed to reach consensus on the specifics; no additional monitoring and control measures for the longline fishery were included in the revised CMM.     Allocation"
WCPFC18,139,"Some CCMs advocated for increasing the bigeye catch limit, indicating that recent scientific advice supported such an increase. Other CCMs stressed that a bigeye longline catch limit increase would have to be linked to the establishment of zone-based management and a strengthened MCS for the longline fishery, as well as a decrease in FAD closures, in the interest of maintaining balance among fishing interests. One CCM advocated strongly against any increase in the bigeye catch limit, noting a decline in longline CPUE in their EEZ. In the absence of consensus regarding any revisions, the Commission agreed to retain the existing longline bigeye catch limits. In addition, the Commission committed to transitioning to a more equitable allocation framework for fishing opportunities that takes into account Articles 8, 10(3) and 30 of the Convention and to commencing a process to develop that process in 2022, to enable reaching agreement in 2023 on hard limits for bigeye among all CCMs.  Other Commercial Fisheries"
WCPFC18,140,"CCMs discussed the setting of limits for Indonesia’s “other fisheries” under CMM 2020-01. CCMs noted that the applicability to Indonesia’s domestic fisheries of the Other Commercial Fisheries category under CMM 2020-01 was addressed at SC17 (SC17-2021-ST-WP02) and TCC17 (TCC17-2021-SC17-ST-IP-09), which agreed on the recommendations provided in those papers. TCC17 requested Indonesia and SPC to provide annual catch estimates for the large-fish handline fishery in Indonesia fishing outside archipelagic waters and territorial sea for vessels >30GT, for 2013-2016 along with baseline options (i.,e,  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  32    average of 2013-2016, or maximum in that period); the period was selected due to the absence of reliable data for 2001-2004. The resulting paper (WCPFC18-2021-24) was considered by WCPFC18 under Agenda Item 7.2.3. During the discussions on this issue under Agenda item 7.2.2, CCMs noted that the majority of data provided by Indonesia regarding its domestic fisheries were used to support the scientific work of the Commission, and raised questions regarding data availability and consistency in setting baseline periods. CCMs agreed to refer the issue to SC18 and TCC18 for consideration prior to making any determinations regarding this issue in the context of the tropical tuna measure.   Conclusion"
WCPFC18,141,"In the course of its deliberations at WCPFC18 the Commission agreed to retain the essential elements of CMM 2020-01 with respect to charter measures; interim objectives for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack; FAD closures; and longline allocation and longline MCS measures. The Commission also agreed on the need to establish hard effort or catch limits for the high seas purse seine fishery, and hard limits for the bigeye longline fishery, and to begin a process of deliberation in 2022 with a view to establishing these in 2023. The Commission established a prohibition on the use of mesh net for any part of a FAD beginning in 2024, and agreed to further consider other issues related to FADs (biodegradable FADs, the impact of FADs, and FAD numbers)."
WCPFC18,142,"In concluding the discussions on the tropical tuna measure the Chair acknowledged the efforts of all CCMs, and noted the constructive consultations that demonstrated a shared willingness to work to improve the Commission’s tropical tuna CMM. The Chair noted the improvements made to the CMM, and observed that the in-depth discussions would serve as a foundation for future efforts to improve management of tropical tuna stocks."
WCPFC18,143,"The Commission adopted CMM 2021-01 on the Conservation and Management Measure for Bigeye, Yellowfin and Skipjack Tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Attachment G)."
WCPFC18,144,"Noting potential issues with data availability, the Commission agreed that, at its regular session in 2022, it would agree a baseline period or limit for the Indonesia Large Fish Handline Fishery, based on the Indonesia proposal and advice from SC18 and TCC18.  7.2.2.1  SSP Analysis of Requests by TTMW2"
WCPFC18,145,"Dr. Graham Pilling and Dr. Paul Hammer (SPC) presented WCPFC18-2021-15. Results of analyses requested by TTMW2 and TTMW1. The first workshop on the development of the new WCPFC Tropical Tuna Measure (TTMW1) requested specific analyses from the SSP to help inform Commission members on options for the new tropical tuna measure (Attachment 2 of WCPFC-TTMW1-2021-Chair’s Report). Similarly, the second workshop (TTMW2) requested further specific analyses from the SSP (Attachment 1 of WCPFC-TTMW2-2021-Chair’s Report). The results of all analyses are presented in the WCPFC18-2021-15, grouped into the different categories provided in the Chair’s reports for the two TTMWs (in Appendix 1 and 2, and the summary provided at the beginning of each section). For each analysis, a short methodological summary is provided where necessary, particularly where interpretation of the request by the SSP was necessary to perform the analysis. This is then followed by the results and, where appropriate, key points for CCMs to note when interpreting those results. In its presentation SPC focussed on the requests made from TTMW2, with an emphasis on the assumptions that SPC had to make in doing the analyses, and that CCMs must be aware of when interpreting the results. SPC noted that issues related to TRPs were addressed in WCPFC18-2021-11 by Steven Hare (discussed under Agenda Item 7.2.1.2)."
WCPFC18,146,"Indonesia inquired regarding the FAD closure analyses why the same bigeye fishing scenario combinations (as shown in Table 27 of WCPFC18-2021-15) resulted in an 11% of reaching LRP under the WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  33    long-term recruitment scenario, vs. a 0% chance of breaching the LRP under the “recent” recruitment scenario. SPC stated that the recent scenario assumes the recent higher levels of recruitment will continue into the future; this is more optimistic than the longer-term recruitment scenario.  The two scenarios  lead to significant differences in the level of future recruitment, and hence stock productivity. As a result, the same level of fishing drives the stock to a lower level under the long-term (less optimistic recruitment) scenario."
WCPFC18,147,"RMI on behalf of FFA members noted with appreciation the results of the analyses requested by the TTMW2, and stated they would comment on these in the respective agenda items."
WCPFC18,148,The Commission noted the analyses undertaken by the Scientific Services Provider (SPC) as requested by the Tropical Tuna Measure Workshops.  7.2.2.2 Report of the FADMO IWG
WCPFC18,149,"The Chair of the FADMO-IWG (Mr Jamal James of FSM) stated that in 2020 the IWG finalized draft guidelines for non-entangling and biodegradable FADs. These were presented to WCPFC17, which tasked SC17 and TCC17 to review the draft guidelines prepared by the FAD IWG, and directed the IWG to review the draft guidelines based on SC17 and TCC17 input, as well as any additional information on non-entangling and bio-degradable FADs. The 2021 FADMO-IWG was reconvened via email on 15 October, mainly focusing on reviewing the guidelines as tasked. SC17 discussions on the draft guidelines took place through the SC17 ODF. The IWG noted general support to strengthen the existing provisions to reduce entanglement on FADs as proposed by the FADMO-IWG, with a transition period prior to full implementation of non-entangling FADs. The IWG also noted that research on the use of biodegradable materials has been delayed due to the impacts of COVID-19 and more work was needed on the use of biodegradable materials before further requirements are put in place. TCC17 also noted general support for the use of non-entangling and biodegradable FAD materials, and the need for research on the development and application of suitable biodegradable materials in FAD construction, including the use of locally available materials. A majority of CCMs supported full implementation of non-entangling FADs as soon as possible, noting the challenges and difficulties faced by other CCMs (e.g., logistical concerns regarding access to materials, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic). The FADMO-IWG noted that there were no specific recommendations from SC17 and TCC17 related to the guidelines. The IWG also noted a project on non-entangling and biodegradable FAD trials in the WCPO funded by the EU, USA and ISSF, which is expected to provide essential information to the tuna industry on the design, materials, performance, and cost-effectiveness of non-entangling and biodegradable FADs in the WCPO context, and support increased uptake of more ecologically sustainable FAD designs by industry. The project is expected to be completed in late 2023.  The FADMO-IWG Chair stated that IWG members supported moves to ban netting on FADs or the exclusive use of non-entangling materials and designs to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of entanglement of sharks, sea turtles, cetaceans and other vulnerable species, with the timing to be determined by the Commission, noting the research delays and ongoing supply chain disruptions. The updated draft Guidelines for Non-Entangling and Biodegradable FAD Materials are in Annex A of FADMO-IWG-05-2021-WP-01."
WCPFC18,150,"Nauru, on behalf of FFA members, stated that many of the findings made by the fifth session of the FADMO-IWG were consistent with those proposed by FFA members in the Chair’s Consultative Draft, including supporting the banning of mesh netting on FADs and using only non-entangling materials and designs. FFA members stated they also support including a suitable transition period before provisions on the requirements for the use of non-entangling materials come into effect. FFA members endorsed the recommendation for further scientific studies into the development and application of appropriate WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  34    biodegradable materials in FAD construction, including the use of local materials and, additionally, the development of an agreed definition for a ‘biodegradable FAD’."
WCPFC18,151,"Canada welcomed the recommendations put forward regarding biodegradable FADs and reduction in entangling material, and stated it looked forward to further involvement with the FADMO-IWG in the future. It voiced its full support for the report."
WCPFC18,152,"Cook Islands noted that the FADMO-IWG’s report stated that most CCMs are in favour of the recommendations, but that some questions remained regarding definitions and timelines, which were also under consideration in the tropical tuna measure discussions. Cook Islands stated it looked forward to constructive discussions on what could be included in the CMM, and to resolving the outstanding issues."
WCPFC18,153,"The EU supported the conclusions contained in the IWG report, and stated it would have preferred to move more rapidly on priority areas. The EU stated the hope the Commission could progress in 2022 on some issues that had addressed, especially adoption of full non-entangling FADs; it encouraged tasking the FADMO-IWG to actively progress the outstanding issues in 2022, including the issue of monitoring of FADs, which has not been addressed by the IWG to date."
WCPFC18,154,"French Polynesia thanked the FADMO-IWG for the work done to move towards biodegradable and non-entangling FADs, especially in the difficult context of online meetings, and acknowledged that it is a very important issue that needs to be addressed. French Polynesia stated it faces growing marine pollution due to abandoned and lost FADs, and that much needs to be done to have effective management of FADs in the Commission.  It advocated that a stronger management scheme for FADs be included in the future, covering better marking, monitoring, reporting, and tracking, as well as retrieval and recovery, whether it be under the framework of the tropical tuna measure or a specific FAD CMM, whichever is more suitable. French Polynesia looked forward to working collaboratively with other CCMs on that topic. French Polynesia noted that it is situated in the overlap area, and FADs drift from east to west, and encouraged comprehensive and collaborative work on the issues with IATTC."
WCPFC18,155,"The Commission noted the report and recommendations of the FAD Management Options IWG (WCPFC18-2021-FADMgmtOptions). The recommendations of the IWG were considered in the context of the Tropical Tuna Measure (see Agenda 7.2.2 above).  7.2.3 Other Commercial Fisheries for bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin"
WCPFC18,156,"Indonesia introduced WCPFC18-2021-24. Indonesia and SPC. Options for a baseline of the “large-fish” Handline fishery fishing in Indonesia’s EEZ (IEEZ) with vessels >30GT for the WCPFC Tropical Tuna Measure, which discusses work conducted on the application of paragraph 51 of CMM 2020-01 to Indonesia’s “Other Commercial” domestic fisheries. Indonesia noted the following relevant papers: SC17-2021-ST-WP02 An assessment of available information to address the WCPFC17 recommendation on the Tropical Tuna CMM para 51 (other commercial fisheries) and TCC17-2021-SC17 ST-IP-09 Availability of Catch Estimates from the Other Commercial Fisheries in Indonesia. It stated that TCC17 requested that Indonesia and SPC provide and present to WCPFC18 for consideration the annual catch estimates for the “large-fish” handline fishery in Indonesia fishing outside archipelagic waters and territorial sea for vessels >30GT, and options for a baseline (using the average of 2013-2016 or the maximum year, due to the absence of data for 2001-2004), with the goal of informing revision of paragraph 51. It noted that the paper invites WCPFC18 to review and consider the baseline of 12,682 mt (the maximum annual catch in the period 2013-2016) listed in Table 1 in the paper as the limit for the “large-fish” handline fishery in Indonesia under paragraph 51 of CMM 2020-01. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  35"
WCPFC18,157,"The USA referenced the discussion during TCC17, where it expressed some concern that WCPFC would base the limit on the 2013-2016 period solely because that is the only period for which reliable data are available. It suggested staying with the intent of the measure, which was to use a much earlier period. It noted that data is available back to 2000, and for dates up to 2012 catch estimates are available but combine the large fish handline with other gear. It inquired whether those figures (in Table A2 in SC17-2021/ST-IP-09) are limited or faulty (other than the fact they do not distinguish between the fisheries). Indonesia stated that improving the data collection was a long process, and that it is a very complex fishery. Regarding the differing baselines, as explained previously, and as SPC has indicated, a detailed breakdown, especially for the large fish handline fishery for 2001-2004, is not available. Indonesia stated that the data presented in WCPFC18-2021-24 were the only reliable data, and that it could try to address compatibility with 2001-2004 data. SPC noted that it had not performed a detailed review of Indonesia’s data prior to 2010, and was unable to address possible uncertainties or assess their reliability."
WCPFC18,158,"Japan stated that paragraph 51, requires that CCMs “not exceed either the average level for the period 2001-2004 or the level of 2004”, and inquired regarding the logic of using the maximum for 2015 and not the average over the period for 2013-2016. Indonesia stated that the options for choosing the baseline for 2013-2016 were to use the average or maximum catch, and that it preferred to use the highest catch during that period; it noted that the status of the fishery stocks during that period was satisfactory, making use of the maximum catch reasonable."
WCPFC18,159,"China stated that it is important to understand the situation of the “other commercial fisheries”, and inquired regarding the total number of fishing vessels over 30m that caught this total, and the composition of the catch in terms of skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye. It noted that the total catch in 2012 was about 2,600 mt, which by 2015 had increased to12,600 mt, and asked the reason for this? China acknowledged that data collection is very hard for small fisheries, and asked how data is reported (by vessel owners, port sampling etc)? Indonesia noted the improvements in data collection and reiterated its thanks for the WPEA project. It stated that in 2010 data collection was mainly based on the port sampling program under the WPEA, and it had about 6 landing sites. This expanded with cooperation from industry, NGOs and other stakeholders. Indonesia developed its harvest strategy in 2018 and expanded the coverage of port sampling sites to 23 landing sites (the figure is now higher). It stated the work is linked to Indonesia’s National Management Plan and harvest strategy work, and that Indonesia also collects data from observers, which involves its industry and NGOs. Data collection has improved since 2014 and 2015, and thus the current catch is more representative of the actual amount (the increase is the result of better data collection). Regarding the number of vessels over 30 m, for handline fisheries this is provided in the Annual Report Part 1; it is around 20 vessels, but not all are on the WCPFC RFV (Indonesia stated this would have to be confirmed)."
WCPFC18,160,"The EU thanked Indonesia and SPC for their efforts to progress this issue, noting the difficulties, and supported further work. The EU suggested it could be useful if the recommendations for the limits and reference periods could be brought together into a single document, and stated it was unclear what the catch totals would be in the context of the CMM. It inquired if a rough estimate was available regarding the share that would not be included under the heading commercial fisheries by focusing only on those fisheries for which data are available. Indonesia stated it could try and provide the requested information in a single document. It recalled the discussion in TCC17 of the difficulties in assessing these data, and stated that Indonesia’s understanding was the fisheries that fall under the tropical tuna measure are limited to the large fish handline fleet composed of vessels over 30 m. It stated that under its national law it could not assess the other fisheries. Indonesia stated that a response with respect to the pole and line fishery might require further collaboration. SPC stated that more information on the other commercial fisheries was available in WCPFC18-2021-IP04, Tables 8 and 9, which includes data for those that are not covered by CMM 2020-01. SPC stated that if further information was needed it could expand on the referenced tables in future years.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  36"
WCPFC18,161,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, noted and endorsed the recommendations from the SC17 and TCC17 relating to the application of paragraph 51 to both Indonesia and the Philippines. They thanked the two CCMs for working with SPC and providing the requested information for the tropical tuna measure and the Commission’s scientific work. They noted the concern expressed by other CCMs about the implication of selecting other baseline periods. FFA members stated that the information provided by Indonesia had not been considered by the SC and the TCC in the same way that the baselines for the other relevant fisheries covered by paragraph 51 had been. They stated they consider this review to be important, both for the purpose of ensuring due process, and also to ensure that the implications of the different baseline period can be considered. FFA members therefore recommended that SC18 and TCC18 review the recommended baseline period and provide advice to WCPFC19. They also noted they would need to consider the implications for the drafting of the new tropical tuna measure."
WCPFC18,162,"PNG stated its understanding that the bulk of the data concern fishing in archipelagic waters, and stated that Indonesia’s continued efforts in this regard were very much appreciated."
WCPFC18,163,The Commission noted the presentation by Indonesia of advice of SC17 and TCC17 on the implementation of paragraphs 50 and 51 of CMM 2020-01 with respect to the Indonesian “large-fish” handline fishery for vessels >30gt in Indonesia’s EEZ (WCPFC18-2021-24). The recommendations were considered in the context of the Tropical Tuna Measure (see Agenda 7.2.2 above).  7.3 South Pacific Albacore 7.3.1 Review of the interim target reference point
WCPFC18,164,"Dr. Graham Pilling (SPC) presented WCPFC18-2021-17 by SPC. Recalibration of the target reference point for South Pacific albacore and referenced WCPFC18-2021-18. Secretariat. Reference Document for South Pacific Albacore for the Review of CMM 2015-02 and Development of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06. SPC noted that a new stock assessment was agreed by SC17 in 2021; SC17 also requested that SPC (i) recalibrate the TRP that would on average achieve the agreed goal of an 8% increase in vulnerable biomass (CPUE proxy) for the southern longline fishery as compared to 2013 levels and (ii) undertake projections to estimate the constant catch levels that would achieve that recalibrated TRP, on average, over the long-term. The general approach used was comparable to that used to recalibrate the skipjack interim TRP; in this case longline and troll fisheries were projected with their future catch level adjusted to achieve long-term WCPFC-CA longline vulnerable biomass levels specified under the TRP. SC17 requested two catch scenarios: one in which fishing levels within both the southern WCPFC-CA and the remainder of the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) were adjusted proportionally; and a second in which only fishing levels within the southern WCPFC-CA were adjusted, and with the remainder of the EPO fixed at recent catch levels."
WCPFC18,165,"To achieve the WCPFC-CA longline vulnerable biomass goal, the recalibrated southern WCPFC-CA albacore TRP depletion level is 68% SBF=0. At that average depletion level, there is a 1%-2% risk of falling below the LRP. This reflects the notable uncertainty within the South Pacific albacore assessment. The recalibrated TRP implies a less depleted stock; the 2021 assessment indicates less depleted recent historical levels, influenced by the SC17 model grid weighting. Approximate catch levels in longline and troll fisheries across the South Pacific, and within the WCPFC-CA specifically, that achieved the TRP varied according to the catch scenarios:   WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  37    (i) Under South Pacific-wide management, total (longline + troll) catch levels equated to 49,200 mt. WCPFC-CA catch was 40,500 mt, with 8,700 mt in the remaining EPO assuming relative regional catch levels between regions remained at 2017-2019 levels. (ii) With management in the WCPFC-CA only (EPO catch remaining at 2017-2019 average levels), total (longline + troll) catch levels were just over 51,700 mt; of this 36,200 mt was in the WCPFC-CA, with 15,500 mt in the remaining EPO. The lower WCPFC-CA catch level reflects additional management action required to achieve the TRP if cross-Pacific management is not feasible. Actual total and WCPFC-CA catch levels would depend upon those that occur in the EPO.  The recalibrated TRP implied lower catch levels within the southern WCPFC-CA than under the 2018 assessment (which were approximately 46,700 mt in the southern WCPFC-CA). This is influenced by:  (i) The Pacific-wide nature of the 2021 stock assessment and the implications of fishing in the EPO component that was not previously considered; and  (ii) The different responsiveness of the 2021 assessment grid to changes in future catch.  What is consistent between the 2021 and 2018 assessments is that the interim TRP will not be achieved under recent catch levels in the southern WCPFC-CA. It is expected that future TRP-related catch levels will need to be adjusted in the face of increased knowledge of the South Pacific albacore stock. This will be supported through the adoption of a harvest strategy that can adapt dynamically to, for example, good or poor recruitment events, and be robust to the uncertainties inherent in the stock assessments."
WCPFC18,166,"In response to a query from Canada, SPC stated that the EPO in the modelling excludes the overlap area (that are being included in the WCPFC-CA figures). The longline and troll catch in the WCPFC-CA is dominated (about 95%) by longline catch. Details are provided in WCPFC18-2021-IP05."
WCPFC18,167,"Samoa, on behalf of FFA members fully supported the advice from SPC on investing more resources and time on improving the close-kin-mark-recapture (CKMR) work, which has proven to address the uncertainties of the stock biomass estimates. They noted that the presentation and paper constituted new information for the Commission to consider, but stated their immediate concern that the recalibrated TRP signals high South Pacific albacore catch cuts will be required to achieve the TRP, which would further threaten the survival of their domestic longline fishing industries; waiting will only worsen the situation. FFA members recommended referring the matter to the South Pacific Albacore IWG to consider appropriate actions in the workplan for 2022. In the meantime, and as indicated in WCPFC18-2021-DP04, they called for an immediate freeze of catch and effort for South Pacific albacore south of the equator on the high seas."
WCPFC18,168,"Indonesia noted the TRP for South Pacific albacore of 0.68 is high, and inquired what projections indicate would happen should the TRP not be achieved. SPC stated that the TRP is 68% of unfished levels based on the most recent stock assessment, which is higher than the previous TRP, but that this was needed to have the CPUE 8% above 2013 levels. There are uncertainties in stock movement that influence the results of the stock assessment that SPC hopes will be addressed through the CKMR work. Projections of stock status indicate a reduction under recent fishing conditions, with stock recovering and stabilizing over time but with CPUE not recovering to the point that managers have sought to achieve through the TRP."
WCPFC18,169,"New Caledonia observed that troll fisheries are perhaps 5% of catch, but that the South Pacific troll fishery targets small fish in southern parts of the WCPFC-CA, and inquired regarding the real impact of the troll fishery on the health of the stock. In response, SPC referred to an impact plot from the stock assessment for different gears, stating that it was correct that troll fisheries catch smaller fish around 60 cm that would otherwise grow into the adult population, but noted that the natural mortality of those fish is also high. SPC further emphasized that the major impact is through the longline fishery, and that the impact from troll fishery is fairly small, although not insignificant."
WCPFC18,170,"China thanked SPC for the stock assessment conducted in conjunction with IATTC, and inquired whether subsequent assessments would be conducted jointly, and whether any conservation measures would WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  38    be undertaken in both the EPO and WCPO. SPC stated that it worked with IATTC because this was a Pacific-wide stock assessment (previously SPC had not considered the EPO in conjunction with the WCPO). SPC stated it would cooperate with IATTC on any future Pacific-wide stock assessments. In terms of more stringent measures required in the WCPO, SPC analysed both the application of consistent conservation and management measures across the WCPO and EPO, and a second scenario where changes were made only by WCPFC in the WCPO and overlap area."
WCPFC18,171,The Commission noted the advice of the SC17 related to a recalibration of the interim TRP for the SP albacore.  7.3.2 Roadmap for effective conservation and management of SP albacore
WCPFC18,172,"Ms Neomai Ravitu (Fiji), Chair of the South Pacific Albacore-Roadmap-IWG (Fiji) provided a summary of the outcomes of the virtual meeting held in June 2021, as contained in WCPFC18-2021-South Pacific albacore-RM-IWG Chair’s Summary Report of the South Pacific Albacore Roadmap IWG Meeting."
WCPFC18,173,"China suggested the need for additional consultations between members prior to SPA-IWG meetings to enable a more complete exchange of views in the IWG, and suggested the need for transparency with respect to the total allowable catch under existing (and planned) VDS or catch-based management regimes for CCMs’ EEZs. China suggested that the South Pacific albacore total allowable catch (TAC) in SIDS national jurisdictions was much higher than the current catch, which complicates developing an understanding of the situation in the albacore fishery. China indicated that it had provided these comments to the SPA-IWG. It also stated that while it sought to cooperate on management measures, but with the condition that the new CMM is comprehensive, and not limited to south of 20°S."
WCPFC18,174,"Niue on behalf of FFA members thanked the Chair of the SPA-IWG and stated as indicated in WCPFC18-2021-DP04, they urged the work of the SPA-IWG be prioritized for early 2022. Noting it is unfortunate that not much has progressed given the situation. FFA members voiced their commitment to the work and provided suggestions on revisions to the IWG Workplan: (i) the IWG should prioritise the setting of a TAC/total allowable effort (TAE) for the stock followed by an allocation framework for the Commission and the allocations of the limit for CCMs; and (ii) priority should be given to development of the harvest strategy for the South Pacific albacore fishery.  They noted the lack of movement on the work on trajectories and associated catch cuts and suggested the harvest strategy was essential for responding to the latest assessment results. They looked forward to working collaboratively with other CCMs in the SPA-IWG."
WCPFC18,175,"French Polynesia commented regarding Agenda items 7.3.1 and 7.3.2. They noted that because of their location in the overlap area they particularly appreciated the Pacific-wide analysis, and the work on recalibration of the TRP, they share the concern of other members about continuing declining catch rates.  They thanked the SPA-IWG for the work conducted under the difficult virtual meeting context in 2022. French Polynesia emphasised the importance of the South Pacific albacore fishery for its economy and food security, noting that South Pacific albacore is fished by its domestic longline fleet and local crew, only in its EEZ, and in a sustainable way validated by MSC certification. It stated that its EEZ is surrounded by a large high seas area, and that French Polynesia is increasingly worried about the level of catch and transhipments that occur in these international waters, and that it looked forward to this important issue being addressed by the Commission. It supported further scientific work to inform management, and a strong roadmap for the IWG for next year, to ensure progress can be made at WCPFC19, especially on harvest strategies matters for South Pacific albacore. It shared Niue’s (on behalf of FFA members) concern about the need for prioritisation of the work for the IWG, and stated it would be happy to work collaboratively with all CCMs on that topic. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  39"
WCPFC18,176,"Chinese Taipei supported management of the South Pacific albacore stock, and stated the need for collaborative effort. It stated that fishing and the related impact are in both the EEZs and high seas. It favoured keeping management measures in the area south of 20°S, and stated it would be favour additional discussions on any further measures, or extension of existing measures from 20°S to the equator."
WCPFC18,177,"New Zealand stated it remained committed to the work of the SPA-IWG to insure a more stable and economically viable fishery, and supported comments by FFA members. It emphasized the need to prioritise the harvest strategy work for 2022, and to maintain MSC certification, noting FFA members want to establish a TAC split between high seas and EEZs, and are working on establishing a zone-based management approach for South Pacific albacore."
WCPFC18,178,"New Caledonia stated that South Pacific albacore is the main species targeted by its longline fisheries, and stated it shared priorities expressed by Niue."
WCPFC18,179,"The USA stated its support for giving priority to the work of the SPA-IWG in 2022, in particular the need to consider controls on fish mortality in areas of greatest mortality, in Regions 1 and 2 (N of 25°S). It stated that moving the stock toward the TRP is critical for livelihoods and food security."
WCPFC18,180,"The EU encouraged all CCMs to progress the South Pacific albacore work, which is an important stock for many CCMs. It announced that the EU would be making a voluntary contribution to the CKMR work for South Pacific albacore (pending approval by the Commission of the project as part of the budget for 2022), and stated it hoped this would help strengthen the scientific basis for the work."
WCPFC18,181,Canada echoed the concerns of other CCMs with respect to the declining trends in South Pacific albacore CPUE. It supported finding ways to extend controls over South Pacific albacore fishing activities on all areas south of the equator.
WCPFC18,182,"Japan also shared concerns over the South Pacific albacore stock. It stated it fully understands the FFA position regarding zone-based management, and would join work to develop effective management measures for the stock."
WCPFC18,183,The Commission noted the report of progress from the SP Albacore Roadmap Working Group (WCPFC18-2021-South Pacific albacore-RM-IWG).
WCPFC18,184,"The Commission noted the priorities for the SP albacore Roadmap IWG for 2022, in particular the development of a Harvest Strategy for SPA or SPA fisheries, the setting of a TAC and allocation, and encouraged CCMs to continue to work cooperatively in the IWG.  7.3.3 Review of CMM 2015-02"
WCPFC18,185,"The Chair noted that Samoa (under Agenda Item 7.3.1) indicated that FFA members called for an immediate freeze on South Pacific albacore catch levels south of the equator, and invited comments from CCMs."
WCPFC18,186,"New Caledonia stated it shared the FFA members’ concerns, as its longline fishery is strongly dependent on South Pacific albacore, which is important both economically and for food security. It stated it has developed a sustainable approach to management of fisheries in its EEZ, with fishing activity restricted to a small number of domestic vessels, with a historically low fishing effort. The stock assessment shows the South Pacific albacore stock is in a healthy condition, even though yield continues to decline, with the stock devolving towards an overfished situation. Decreasing yields and declining CPUE in Melanesia lead WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  40    New Caledonia to fear that without strong management measures, the conditions under the TRP will not be achieved. New Caledonia stated it is also very concerned about increased catch in high seas pocket 7, which has almost doubled during 2019-2020. It called for strong action to be taken to avoid further decline in the South Pacific albacore stock status, especially in the high seas in the southern part of the WCPFC-CA, and reiterated the need for more accurate data and specific analyses to be produced regarding high seas fishing activities to inform the decisions of the Commission."
WCPFC18,187,Samoa called for an immediate freeze on catches on the high seas south of the equator.
WCPFC18,188,"The USA stated it was open to considering a freeze on South Pacific albacore catch and effort that applied to the entire WCPFC-CA, not just the high seas, and that such a freeze would need to be binding for all members."
WCPFC18,189,"Cook Islands on behalf of FFA members stated they consider that CMM 2015-02 needs comprehensive revision to ensure that the fishery remains both sustainable and viable given its economic importance to the region. They also noted their strong concerns about the results of the latest SPC analyses on albacore, and stated that the current measure is ineffective for monitoring and controlling the fishery, and cannot be effectively enforced. Accordingly, FFA members stated they would seek to collaborate with all CCMs and the SPA-IWG in the development of a new measure for South Pacific albacore for 2022. They stated that the new CMM must recognise the zone-based management approach in the management of this fishery in CCMs’ zones and result in a genuine, material improvement in how the fishery is managed through WCPFC. They called on all CCMs fishing south of the equator for a commitment to maintain or reduce their effort and catch until the Commission has in place a revised CMM with effective management arrangements for this fishery and allocations of any catch or effort limits to both the high seas and EEZs."
WCPFC18,190,"China stated that regarding fishing effort, it indicated in 2012 it would control its effort to less than 400 vessels; since then it has had fewer than 400 vessels, and often significantly fewer. China stated that to control fishing effort a comprehensive CMM is needed that applies to the entire WCPO area. China stressed that a freeze could not apply to only the high seas, which China suggested would not be for the purpose of conservation, but for the benefit of select CCMs. China stated that FFA CCMs’ TAC in their EEZs totals over 100,000 mt/year, and that even with no effort on the high seas, this level of catch would cause South Pacific albacore to continue to decline. China noted that finding a solution for South Pacific albacore is a shared obligation, and that if any action was limited to the high seas, it could not agree to it. It also inquired how many of each CCM’s vessels fished for South Pacific albacore."
WCPFC18,191,"Chinese Taipei stated this was a very important issue for its fleet. It supported the work of SPC, which it hoped can provide information to improve management. It supported extending the management area to include the area from the equator to 20°S, and stated that it seeks to maintain the current management system, and that CCMs should take efforts together to manage the stock."
WCPFC18,192,"Niue noted that a lot of the catch increases are occurring in the high seas, which is why FFA members sought a binding freeze on any increase in the high seas. It noted that FFA members have their own management measures, and their negotiations would continue."
WCPFC18,193,"China requested information from SPC on the distribution of South Pacific albacore catch in the WCPO high seas vs. EEZs. SPC referenced Table 1 of WCPFC18-2021-IP05. China noted that this indicated a downward trend in total catch, and that the high seas catch had not increased sharply. China stated that the figures did not support a decision to cap fishing effort only on the high seas, and that it couldn’t agree to such a cap.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  41"
WCPFC18,194,"CCMs consulted on steps that could help in addressing the situation while a new CMM is negotiated. In the course of their discussions, some CCMs supported the proposal, and some CCMs raised the following points: • South Pacific albacore is neither overfished or subject to overfishing, but achieving the interim TRP, adopted in 2018, would require that action be taken. The interim TRP is in the WCPFC15 report, and hence not a binding measure.  • Inclusion of reference years could be problematic for some CCMs. • A freeze on catch should be voluntary. • A freeze on effort should apply to all members for the entire Convention Area. • Attribution and record of catch on the high seas could complicate a mandatory provision."
WCPFC18,195,The Commission noted that the review of CMM 2015-02 Conservation and Management Measure for South Pacific Albacore is ongoing as part of the work of the SP Albacore Roadmap IWG. The Commission encouraged the SPA Roadmap IWG to speed up its process and progress its recommendations.
WCPFC18,196,"The Commission noted concerns regarding the delayed process to implement an interim TRP adopted in 2018, and the need to take action to rebuild the stock to support the economic viability of fleets, and achieve a long-term TRP."
WCPFC18,197,"Given the urgency of these concerns, the Commission agreed that until a new CMM for South Pacific Albacore is adopted, each CCM is encouraged to take steps to implement interim controls on South Pacific albacore catch or effort across the convention area south of the equator.  i. CCMs are encouraged to limit commercial fishing of South Pacific albacore within EEZs to domestically applied catch or effort limits in recent years.   ii. Each CCM is encouraged to ensure that its flagged vessels for this species shall not exceed the high seas catch or effort (such as number of vessels) of South Pacific albacore by its flagged vessels in recent years."
WCPFC18,198,These interim arrangements do not confer the allocation of rights to any CCM and are without prejudice to any future decisions of the Commission.
WCPFC18,199,"These interim arrangements shall not prejudice the legitimate rights and obligations under international law for small island developing State and Participating Territory CCMs in the Convention Area for whom South Pacific albacore is an important component of the domestic tuna fishery in waters under their national jurisdiction, and who may wish to pursue a responsible level of development of their fisheries for South Pacific albacore in their EEZs or adjacent high seas.  7.4 Pacific bluefin  7.4.1 Review of CMM 2020-02"
WCPFC18,200,"The NC Chair introduced proposed revisions to CMM 2020-02, noting WCPFC18-2021-19. Secretariat. Reference Document for the review of CMM 2020-02 and development of harvest strategies (Pacific Bluefin Tuna) and Highlights from NC17 for Agenda 9.3. The NC Chair reviewed the stock status WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  42    of Pacific bluefin tuna, and indicated the initial rebuilding target had been achieved 2 years earlier than scheduled, and the second target was on track to be achieved earlier than expected. The NC recommended that the Commission adopt the revised CMM for Pacific Bluefin Tuna in Attachment D of the NC17 Summary Report (Attachment A to WCPFC18-2021-19) and the revised Harvest Strategy for Pacific Bluefin Tuna Fisheries in Attachment E of the NC17 Summary Report (Attachment B to WCPFC18-2021-19)."
WCPFC18,201,"Japan voiced strong support for revisions to the CMM as recommended by the NC chair. It stated that the proposed 15% catch increase for large fish was fully in accordance with the harvest strategy, and that it was very confident this would decrease the burden on small-scale fishermen, while achieving the conservation goals with respect to Pacific bluefin tuna. It reviewed the management measures implemented by WCPFC, noting that in 2017 a harvest strategy was adopted, with two rebuilding targets and harvest strategy rules. Japan stated it had complied with the management measures in order to rebuild the stock, which it stated was not an easy task, because a significant number of artisanal and small-scale fishermen fish for this species in Japan’s coastal waters. It stated that fishermen had made significant sacrifices to comply with the management measures. Japan noted that the probability of achieving the second rebuilding target was over 97%, and stated that adjusting the catch limit was important for promoting fishermen’s active involvement in further management. Japan also noted that Pacific bluefin tuna is highly migratory and is thus managed cooperatively with IATTC; the 15% increase was adopted by IATTC and will be in effect in 2022. Japan reiterated the importance of Pacific bluefin tuna for Japan, and stressed that this was Japan’s in-zone fishery, and that it would continue to exercise its responsibility for sustainable management and research with respect to the stock."
WCPFC18,202,"Tokelau, on behalf of FFA members, stated that the proposed revised CMM would include an increase in catches for Pacific bluefin tuna. While they noted that an increase in catch is allowed under the recovery plan, it is by no means mandatory or automatic, especially when there is so much uncertainty in the assessment, and the spawning stock biomass is estimated to be an extremely low 4.5% of SBF=0, which is well below the LRP of 20%SBF=0 employed by the WCPFC for its main tuna stocks. FFA members stated they were therefore very concerned about the proposed increases in the review of the CMM and needed to give the proposal serious consideration."
WCPFC18,203,"Korea agreed with comments from Japan. It noted that extensive discussion had been held on the issue during July to October 2021, and that FFA members participated in the NC17 meeting. It stated its expectation was that the Commission would adopt the new CMM as the NC recommended."
WCPFC18,204,"The EU acknowledge the efforts of the CCMs involved and stated it was also concerned about the proposed increases, and that in spite of the positive biomass trends and the optimistic trends, the stock remained at very low levels, and the uncertainty regarding the stock status required a precautionary approach. The EU stated it would not oppose the recommendations, but stated the need to be very cautious until second rebuilding target is attained."
WCPFC18,205,"Chinese Taipei stated the Commission should follow the harvest strategy and best available scientific information available from ISC, which indicates the stock is recovering. It supported an increase in the catch limits, stating that this is a conservative approach."
WCPFC18,206,"RMI on behalf of PNA and Tokelau supported the work that had gone into the proposed CMM, which it acknowledged is consistent with the harvest strategy, but stated it was difficult to support the recommendations for catch increases, given that the spawning biomass is at a very low level and overfishing is continuing."
WCPFC18,207,"Niue stated it shared some concerns about the status of stock, but could support the proposal. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  43"
WCPFC18,208,"Solomon Islands on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau stated they were troubled by the inconsistency of being asked to support increased catches of a bluefin stock, which has been severely depleted, while the CCMs involved were holding up agreement on a revised skipjack TRP because they want to reduce effort for a very healthy and well-managed stock. They indicated as well their concern about the apparent inconsistency of banning retention of oceanic whitetip and silky sharks, for which there are similar conservation concerns to those of bluefin, and then being asked to support increasing catches of this severely depleted bluefin stock, and requested an explanation for these inconsistencies."
WCPFC18,209,The NC Chair indicated that IATTC decided on a 15% increase in the catch limit plus a 200 mt increase.
WCPFC18,210,"China stated it had no Pacific bluefin tuna specific-fisheries, and that it was appropriate for the NC to make this recommendation. It supported the proposal, and noted that the NC’s recommendation was based on Annex 1 of the rules of procedure, and that this was not automatically a Commission decision. China stated that if the proposal was contrary to the objectives of the Commission, it should be rejected; otherwise, it should be approved."
WCPFC18,211,"The Ocean Foundation noted that Pacific bluefin tuna was still overfished and experiencing overfishing, and stated that with this proposal WCPFC risked undermining the work that had already been done. It recommended that WCPFC makes its own choice based on the merits of the proposal, and advocated that WCPFC reject the recommendation from NC to increase the catch limits. It stated that instead of making progress developing a management strategy evaluation (MSE)-tested harvest strategy for this species, the NC had repeatedly debated increases to catch limits, despite a very depleted stock (below 5% of SBF=0), and stated that achievement of the rebuilding target should be confirmed through a stock assessment. It noted the lack of new advice from the NC, and the suggested caution by NC16, given the uncertainty in the stock assessment. It noted that when the low recruitment scenario was used in the projection analysis in 2018, there was only a 3% chance of achieving the rebuilding target, and stated that this scenario was not used in 2020 due to an ISC decision. The Ocean Foundation advocated that under Agenda Item 9.3, the Commission should ask the NC to make good on its commitment to develop an MSE for harvest strategy adoption by 2024, noting that this commitment had already been made by the NC, but with inadequate progress to date. It stated that the high value (billion dollar) Pacific bluefin tuna fishery deserved such a commitment."
WCPFC18,212,"Japan acknowledged that an increase in the harvest would slow the recovery slightly, and stated that despite the slight uncertainty inherent in all assessments, it was certain that the PBF stock would recover even with the increase."
WCPFC18,213,"RMI noted the comments by Solomon Islands and echoed their request for an explanation of the inconsistencies. RMI stated it understood the importance of the fishery to Japan, culturally and economically, and noted that these factors were equally applicable for other CCMs regarding species in their waters. It also registered its ongoing concern with the underlying science behind the proposal, noting that overfishing was ongoing, and the spawning biomass was less than 5%."
WCPFC18,214,"Japan stated that taking into account that the stock is on the way to recovery, and the uncertainty in the stock assessment, the proposed catch increase was conservative, and that if the stock declined under the increased catch, the catch would be reduced, in accordance with the harvest strategy."
WCPFC18,215,The Commission noted the presentation by the NC Chair on the stock status of the Pacific bluefin tuna.
WCPFC18,216,The Commission adopted CMM 2021-02 Conservation and Management Measure for Pacific Bluefin Tuna (Attachment H). WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  44    7.5 Southwest Pacific swordfish  7.5.1 Future projections as requested by WCPFC16
WCPFC18,217,"The Chair noted the SC17 advice and results of the future projections for Southwest Pacific swordfish as tasked by WCPFC16 (para 481, WCPFC16 Summary Report) and SC17 (para 69-71, SC17 Outcomes Document); SC17 noted that the current CMM (CMM 2009-03) does not contain provisions to limit total fishing mortality."
WCPFC18,218,"SPC presented WCPFC18-2021-20-rev1 Southwest Pacific Swordfish projections and referenced WCPFC18-2021-21. Secretariat.  Reference Document for the Review of CMM 2009-03 (Southwest Pacific swordfish). SPC stated that WCPFC18-2021-20-rev1 describes the results of stochastic stock projections for southwest Pacific Ocean swordfish, using the 2021 stock assessment (WCPFC-SC17-2021-SA-WP-04). The projections explore the outcomes of 8 different future fishing (catch- or effort-based) scenarios according to requests from WCPFC16 and SC17, as follows:  • “Status quo (SQ) catches”: this projection assumes recent (average 2016-2018) levels of fishing (catch) both north and south of 20°S. • +/- “SQ catches”: an additional limited number of projections which assume future catch scenarios across the region that are a fixed percentage above and below “status quo” and that result in a range of upward and downward long-term biomass trends. For this request SPC provided projections with a 20% decrease and increase on the status quo catch. • “SQ effort”: this projection assumes recent (average 2016-2018) levels of fishing effort both north and south of 20°S. • +/- “SQ effort”: projections under a 20% decrease and increase on the status quo effort. • “Fully caught limits”: this projection assumes recent (average 2016-2018) levels of fishing (catches) north of 20°S and CCM-nominated maximum total catch levels (paragraph 4 of CMM 2009-13) of fishing south of 20°S. • “Maximum catch”: this projection assumes peak (2011-2013) levels of fishing (catches) north of 20°S and CCM nominated maximum total catch levels (paragraph 4 CMM 2009-13) for fishing south of 20°S."
WCPFC18,219,"The results are presented in terms of the standard performance indicators and reference points used for tuna species by the WCPFC, although there are no formally agreed reference points for this swordfish stock. The results of the 30-year projections showed that of the 8 scenarios, the “Maximum catch” and “Fully caught” scenarios—which involved considerably higher catches than observed over the history of the fishery—often crashed the stock, and led to a high number of projections (54%-69%) declining to <20% SBF=0 by the terminal year. The 6 other catch and effort-based projections had lower impacts. The status quo scenarios maintained the stock at a similar, albeit slightly less depleted status, than at the beginning of the projection period, with low numbers of models (<10%) breaching the standard overfishing and overfished benchmarks for tuna species. The 20% increase and decrease in status quo catches and effort had a moderate impact on terminal stock status compared to status quo. The 20% increases led to a slightly more depleted stock status than the 2019 starting level, with 8%-22% of models breaching the benchmarks for overfishing or overfished status applied to tuna by the WCPFC."
WCPFC18,220,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members noted that the results of the 30-year projections showed that the two high-catch scenarios (i.e. ‘maximum catch’ and ‘fully caught’) produced the worst outcomes for stock status. Both catch scenarios led to the stock becoming considerably more depleted than at the start of the projection period, with a relatively high number of projections indicating the stock crashed after 10 years, underscoring the priority of the work that FFA members have advocated to develop a new swordfish CMM that would prevent these scenarios being realised. They encouraged all CCMs to work with Australia on the WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  45    development of a new measure through 2022. In comparison, projections that maintained the status quo catch and effort levels tended to result in the stock being maintained at levels similar to or slightly less depleted than at the starting year of 2019, both at the 10-year and terminal year stage of the projections. FFA members noted that these status quo catch scenarios also had low associated risk of breaching the standard WCPFC tuna benchmarks for indicating overfishing and overfished status. FFA members stated that the projections were very useful in testing the likely state of the stock in the future under a range of potential catch scenarios and would be critical in informing the development of a future CMM that protects the ongoing sustainability of this stock."
WCPFC18,221,"China stated it would like to work with Australia on this issue, and noted it has no target fisheries for swordfish. It observed that its tropical tuna vessels have some bycatch, but stated that is addressed by total fishing effort through the tropical tuna measure. It noted that South Pacific albacore fisheries also have bycatch and suggested South Pacific albacore and swordfish measures should be developed in parallel to find a better approach to manage these stocks."
WCPFC18,222,"The EU stated that until the Commission decided otherwise it would be more appropriate to present SBMSY and not only 20%SBF=0. It also noted that given that stock is assessed regularly, the 30-year projection result may not be the most useful, and that 10-year projections may provide a more valuable indication of stock status. The EU stated that the latest stock assessment indicates the stock is in good condition; the results seem more optimistic than previously but with more uncertainty, which may be related to the new approach to uncertainty, which was first applied for this stock. The EU suggested asking the SC to examine the issues regarding uncertainty with the aim of producing even better results for the next assessment."
WCPFC18,223,The Commission noted the presentation by SPC of the results of future projections for Southwest Pacific swordfish.  7.5.2 Review of CMM 2009-03
WCPFC18,224,"Australia noted WCPFC18-2021-DP08, which it introduced under Agenda Item 4. It thanked SPC for the recent stock assessment, and stated that while it was encouraged by the healthy status and lack of risk status associated with the status quo, the fully caught and maximum levels presented by SPC in WCPFC18-2021-20-rev1 did present a significant risk. It stated that the current measure for Southwest Pacific swordfish (CMM 2009-03) contains no restrictions on fishing mortality in the high seas area north of 20°S and contains flag-based limits south of 20°S that may be too high to prevent future overfishing. Consequently, it lacks the overall provisions required to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the stock and does not protect either the future fishery development opportunities for SIDS nor the economic viability of current swordfish-targeting fisheries, or fisheries for which swordfish is an important economic bycatch. Australia also stressed that a strong CMM could also ensure there is no future collateral damage to other fisheries, which may occur if the stock is overfished. Australia stated it had committed to developing a new CMM at WCPFC19, and referenced a number of papers prepared for SC17 regarding Southwest Pacific swordfish. It stated that a key feature of the revised draft CMM is that as a result of the healthy status of the stock, it does not seek to reduce fishery catches, but rather, focusses on preventing future increases in catches that could result in overfishing, impact future SIDS fishery development opportunities, and/or impact the economic viability of existing fisheries targeting this species. Australia stated it hoped to progress in drafting the new CMM over the next 12 months, encouraged comments through the ODF, and looked forward to discussions at TCC18 and SC18."
WCPFC18,225,"French Polynesia stated that although CMM 2009-03 contains some management measures intended to limit expansion of fishing on swordfish, it does not contain all the elements of a harvest strategy, WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  46    including a harvest control rule. It stated that these elements are not only necessary to make sure the Commission’s future management is strong enough to ensure the sustainability of the overall fishery in the region, but are also important for French Polynesia to maintain its MSC certification, which was granted in 2021. French Polynesia stated the work undertaken by Australia will strengthen the CMM and contains a good basis for the Commission’s work on harvest strategies for Southwest Pacific swordfish, and looked forward to working collaboratively with other CCMs on future drafts."
WCPFC18,226,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, noted stock projections for Southwest Pacific swordfish that maintain the status quo catch and effort levels have a low associated risk of breaching the standard WCPFC tuna benchmarks indicating overfishing and overfished status, both at the 10 year and terminal year stage of the projections. However, they stated that under the two high-catch scenarios the stock became considerably more depleted (to 10%-18% of unfished spawning biomass levels after 30 years), with a relatively high number of projections that resulted in the stock crashing after only 10 years. They stated that such stock projection findings are a concern, given that SC17 noted that the current measure (CMM 2009-03) for Southwest Pacific swordfish does not contain provisions to limit total fishing mortality on the stock. FFA members stated that the largest sources of fishing mortality for this fishery can be attributed to distant water fishing fleets either targeting or taking swordfish as bycatch on the high seas, and that unless the catch of these fleets and others that significantly contribute to the fishing mortality of the Southwest Pacific swordfish stock can be controlled, it puts at risk the ongoing future sustainability of the stock, future fishery development opportunities for SIDS, and ongoing economic viability of current FFA fisheries targeting this stock. FFA members stated they therefore support WCPFC developing a revised and strengthened CMM that will ensure the ongoing future sustainability of Southwest Pacific swordfish, as emphasised by SC17 (paragraph 226, SC17 Summary Report), and encouraged CCMs to provide feedback on Australia’s draft CMM via the ODF at WCPFC18. FFA members also supported the recommendations made by the authors of the 2021 stock assessment, which include studies to better understand movement patterns and an expansion of minimum reporting requirements for longline operational characteristics, to mitigate against the uncertainties in the stock assessment."
WCPFC18,227,"Cook Islands stated it wanted to take a forward-looking approach and prevent future sustainability issues, and looked forward to working with other CCMs on the issue."
WCPFC18,228,The EU stated it would work with Australia intersessionally to improve the existing CMM.
WCPFC18,229,The Commission noted the work led by Australia to strengthen CMM 2009-03 on Southwest Pacific swordfish.  7.6 North Pacific Striped Marlin 7.6.1 Advice from the ISC
WCPFC18,230,The Chair advised that the Secretariat prepared WCPFC18-2021-22. Reference Document for North Pacific Striped Marlin for the Review of CMM 2010-01 to assist CCMs.
WCPFC18,231,"Dr. John Holmes, ISC Chair, reviewed the stock status and conservation information from the 2019 North Pacific striped marlin stock assessment. He noted that there are no established reference points for the stock, but that the stock status is consistent with it being overfished, with overfishing occurring, relative to MSY reference points. He noted that NC15 asked the ISC for recommendations on the appropriate recruitment scenario for North Pacific Ocean striped marlin stock projections. The ISC recommended the short-term recruitment model was the most appropriate model to use. If the stock continues to experience recruitment consistent with the short-term recruitment scenario (2012 - 2016), then catches must be reduced WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  47    to 60% of the WCPFC catch quota from CMM 2010-01 (i.e., from 3,397 mt to 1,359 mt) in order to achieve a 60% probability of rebuilding to 20%SB0 = 3,610 t by 2022. This change in catch corresponds to a reduction of roughly 37% from the recent average yield of 2,151 mt."
WCPFC18,232,"WCPFC17 asked ISC to look at several issues: (i) Examine differences between ISC stock assessment catch estimates by CCM and WCPFC catch estimates, and work with the Scientific Services Provider to provide an assessment of the shortcomings. The Billfish Working Group (ISC BILLWG), which includes members from SPC, discussed this question at a workshop in early 2021 in the context of a retrospective review of the quality of Japanese catch statistics (Working Paper ISC/21/BILLWG-01/05). The differences in catch estimates between the ISC stock assessment and the WCPFC occurs for longline fisheries that record the catch in numbers, and result from the different methods used to convert numbers to biomass for the WCPFC catch estimates and for the stock assessment. The BILLWG concluded that WCPFC Japanese longline fishery statistics and the output from stock synthesis are similar. (ii) Explain why the striped marlin stock decreased and the fishing mortality increased after a drastic decrease in fishing effort by high seas driftnet fisheries in the early 1990s. The BILLWG identified three potential contributing factors: (1) The model assumes that selectivity for Japanese driftnet catches during 1975-1993 is the same selectivity as in the Japanese coastal driftnet fishery during 1994-2017, although there is an assumed shift from catching large adults to small juveniles, which would result in an increase in fishing mortality even if the overall catch decreased; (2) The CPUE time series has a break in 1993-1994, which could be driving a shift in the model results due to a lack of continuity; and (3) the Japanese logbook data also changed their reporting requirements in 1993 to 1994, which could  contribute to the shift in fishing mortality, but not all CCMs agreed that this would drive the  change in fishing mortality. The ISC BILLWG agreed to estimate the initial equilibrium catch in the stock assessment model, and agreed that differences due to starting year were likely driven by the uncertainty in catches before 1993. (iii) Develop a roadmap to address the issues identified in the latest stock assessment by ISC. The ISC BILLWG recommended revising its work plan to assess the stock in 2022 and postpone the stock assessment to 2023 to address the concerns identified by the questions above, and by the BILLWG in its stock assessment report (ISC/19/ANNEX/11). For example, there were concerns about providing a rebuilding plan in 2021 and then reassessing the stock in 2022. However, the proposed revised workplan would permit updating of the rebuilding plan after the stock assessment in 2022."
WCPFC18,233,"RMI on behalf of FFA members noted that the North Pacific striped marlin stock remains overfished and is currently undergoing overfishing, but that this issue was not discussed by NC17.  FFA members supported the recommendation made by the ISC BILLWG to revise its work plan to assess the North Pacific Ocean striped marlin stock in 2022, rather than in 2023 as originally scheduled. The proposed revised work plan will mean that the latest data and information from the stock assessment can be used to inform the rebuilding plan for striped marlin in the North Pacific. In addition, FFA members stated there should be agreement on the LRP, and that this should be taken up by the Commission in 2022 when developing LRPs for non-target species, as noted at SC17. It stated the urgency for the Commission to agree on measures to reduce fishing mortality, and called on the CCMs exploiting this fishery to take a lead in reducing fishing mortality and exercising restraint in targeting striped marlin in the North Pacific."
WCPFC18,234,"The EU agreed with RMI, and stated it had expressed ongoing concern for this stock, which has had a poor conservation status since about 2011. It acknowledged uncertainties and data conflicts, and stated the need to make progress on analysis and management. It supported the recommendation to modify the stock WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  48    assessment schedule, noting that using the most up-to-date information would hopefully allow that adoption of an effective rebuilding plan."
WCPFC18,235,The Commission noted the presentation by ISC which responded to the request made by the Commission at WCPFC17.
WCPFC18,236,The Commission noted that the ISC would undertake a stock assessment of North Pacific striped marlin in 2022 and that the proposed revised workplan would permit updating of the rebuilding plan using the latest data from the stock assessment. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  7.6.2 Review of CMM 2010-01 and an Interim Rebuilding Plan
WCPFC18,237,"The USA stated that at WCPFC16 the Commission adopted a rebuilding plan for North Pacific striped marlin, and while noting that this was a step in the right direction, the USA stated that further action was required to ensure the stock is able to rebuild within the parameters agreed to. In 2020 the USA submitted a consultative draft proposal, and stated its intent to submit a new proposal in 2022 following completion by ISC of a new stock assessment. It noted that the stock remains very depleted, and stated that the Commission needs to take action to revise CMM 2010-01 to ensure the rebuilding plan is met. The USA stated its understanding regarding a query from the ISC regarding what the rebuilding target should be, and sought to clarify that the rebuilding plan should be based on a dynamic spawning stock biomass. The USA noted that a 2019 study co-authored by ISC BILLWG members found that the stock recruitment dynamics for striped marlin were nonstationary, thus supporting the use of a dynamic SSB. It noted that the appropriate timeframe for calculating the dynamic SSB could be derived by conducting a change point analysis on the recruitment time series to identify the appropriate window, or by scaling the time frame by generating mean time differences between tuna and striped marlin. The USA stated it believed that this would result in a timeframe covering the most recent 15 to 20 years because striped marlin have a longer lifespan than tuna, and would welcome the ISC deriving the appropriate timeframe by applying either of these methods. The USA proposed the following text be adopted by WCPFC18. WCPFC18 agrees that the rebuilding target for WCNPO striped marlin shall be based off the dynamic SSB0 and requests the ISC to derive the appropriate time frame for calculating the dynamic SSB0 by conducting a change point analysis on the recruitment time series to identify the appropriate time window, scaling the time frame based on the relative difference in mean generation times between tunas and striped marlin, or another appropriate methodology."
WCPFC18,238,Japan and Chinese Taipei expressed support for the language proposed by the USA.
WCPFC18,239,"Solomon Islands on behalf of FFA members noted with concern the dire status of the stock in the North Pacific, and stated urgent action is required to halt the decline of this stock and to rebuild it. They stated FFA members are of the view that any management and rebuilding plan for striped marlin in the North Pacific should take into account zone-based management, and indicated they would not support flag-based limits that cover the EEZs, especially if they are based on flag-based catch history in their waters; furthermore, they stated that any rebuilding plan should not limit SIDS’ access to the high seas as per Article 30 of the Convention and Article 25 of the UNFSA. They stated that setting of appropriate LRPs and catch limits would be an important part of the rebuilding plan. FFA members stated that in addition, an effective longline monitoring regime is required for the high seas to be able to monitor flag-based catches, and that until that is in place, it would be difficult to enforce any revised CMM, no matter how good it is on paper. They stated that robust monitoring would include electronic monitoring, a catch documentation scheme with independent verification in place, and robust port inspections and transhipment monitoring regimes.  49"
WCPFC18,240,"RMI, on behalf of PNA and Tokelau stated that the current management arrangement for this stock was not working and needed to be replaced with zone-based management arrangements that include effective monitoring and verification for any catch limits, which will take time. In the meantime, given the urgent need for stronger measures to reduce fishing mortality, they urged the Commission to look at alternative measures to remove targeting of striped marlin in the North Pacific, such as non-retention. They noted this should be an obvious option because that is what the Commission has put in place for oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks to address similar conservation concerns with those stocks. They stated that there appeared to be no other feasible effective management options for this stock at this point. PNA and Tokelau stated that non-retention across the longline and purse seine fisheries is likely to be necessary for rebuilding this stock."
WCPFC18,241,The Commission noted the concerning stock status of North Pacific striped marlin.
WCPFC18,242,The Commission noted that the USA intends to present a proposed revised CMM 2010-01 in 2022.
WCPFC18,243,"The Commission agrees that the rebuilding target for North Pacific striped marlin shall be based off the dynamic SSB0 and requests the ISC to derive the appropriate time frame for calculating the dynamic SSB0 by conducting a change point analysis on the recruitment time series to identify the appropriate time window, scaling the time frame based on the relative difference in mean generation times between tunas and striped marlin, or another appropriate methodology.   AGENDA ITEM 8  — HARVEST STRATEGY 8.1 Review of Indicative Work Plan"
WCPFC18,244,"The Chair noted that the Commission is required to review and update the Indicative Harvest Strategy Work Plan under CMM 2014-06 for 2021 and thereafter. The Chair noted the Secretariat’s reference document (WCPFC18-2021-23-rev1 Reference Document on the progress of the Harvest Strategy Workplan under CMM 2014-06) and WCPFC18-2021-DP05 Draft proposed amendments for the consideration of WCPFC18 to indicative work plan for the adoption of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-06 (prepared by Australia) as reference papers, and noted the work done by Australia to coordinate updates to the harvest strategy work plan (HSWP) and the expectation that these would continue through the WCPFC18 meeting."
WCPFC18,245,"Mr. James Larcombe (Australia) noted that the HSWP in WCPFC18-2021-DP-05 was extended for 2 years, to 2024. He stated that adoption of management procedures for South Pacific albacore and skipjack remained scheduled for 2022, while yellowfin and bigeye management procedures were moved to 2024. For all species, SC is to formally agree on the operating models to be used for the MSE. He noted the plan was developed with assistance of SPC, and that although it was achievable technically, whether it could be achieved by CCMs through the Commission’s procedures and schedule, was a matter for discussion."
WCPFC18,246,"Solomon Islands on behalf of FFA members fully supported the revised HSWP, and noted that more time would be required to complete the ambitious and complex tasks to develop harvest strategies across all four key tuna stocks. FFA members voiced their commitment to the successful implementation of the indicative HSWP, and fully supported the revised plan and its extension for two years, ending in 2024.  They recognised that the HSWP continues to be ambitious and stated their strong desire to make significant progress on harvest strategy matters during 2022 and subsequently. They stated they were very encouraged by the inclusion of continued development of the multispecies framework in the plan, and noted that the WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  50    Commission had been scheduled to agree on TRPs for bigeye and yellowfin tuna at WCPFC18. However, as stated under agenda item 7.2.1.2, given the ongoing impacts of COVID on the business of the Commission, and the major time and effort given to renegotiating the new tropical tuna measure , the Commission was unable to devote the time and energy needed to properly consider these decisions. FFA members stated they continued to encourage capacity-building initiatives to assist CCMs, particularly SIDS, to participate fully in the complex process, and build confidence in the harvest strategy development process and its outcomes when implemented. Noting the increasing number of issues that require the attention of, and feedback from, managers in order to progress the HSWP, FFA members supported the recommendation made by SC17 for a science-management dialogue to be convened in 2022."
WCPFC18,247,"The EU voiced its supports for the work and the future developments under the plan. The EU inquired regarding inclusion of a refined set of management procedures for skipjack, which was to have taken place in 2021, and stated this should still be reflected in the plan. It also noted the need to hold the science-management dialogue in order to progress the work contained in the HSWP. The EU also agreed with FFA regarding the need for capacity building, and noted that this need applied to all CCMs. It inquired whether recorded material from SPC was available, given the number of workshops that were being held in a virtual format, and noted that provision of assistance for all CCMs could help in progressing harvest strategy work. Regarding capacity building, SPC noted that SC17-MI-IP-02 details the stakeholder activities done so far and contained website links. The Science Manager indicated that the Commission’s Harvest Strategy web page was recently updated with the most recent documents and website links."
WCPFC18,248,"Australia stated that while scientific and technical work were proceeding apace and keeping up with ambitions, COVID and other aspects had led to a delay in the Commission’s ability to make significant progress in this complex area. Australia noted a detailed discussion on candidate management procedures (MPs) for skipjack and South Pacific albacore were to have taken place in 2021. It acknowledged that to schedule those matters to be discussed early in 2022 with a decision made by WCPFC19 was ambitious, given that it is important to have a number of cycles of consideration of candidate MPs, with consideration by SC, and the Commission. Australia acknowledged it might be advisable to defer adoption of MPs for skipjack and South Pacific albacore to 2023."
WCPFC18,249,"French Polynesia emphasized that exceptional circumstances should not stand in the way of progress, and agreed that the science-management dialogue be convened in 2022, given the work needed on South Pacific albacore and other species. French Polynesia stated it was flexible regarding the date as long as it was scheduled to inform WCPFC19’s decisions."
WCPFC18,250,PNG voiced support for a science-management dialogue.
WCPFC18,251,"Indonesia echoed the concern from other CCMs regarding the need for a science-management dialogue to help CCMs understand the harvest strategy development process and how to develop management measures. It voiced concern that some CCMs would be left behind in terms of the process, and noted that while documents and presentations were available online its preference was to be directly involved. Indonesia also indicated its interest in the development of harvest strategies for Indonesia’s archipelagic waters, and looked forward to additional dialogue with SPC regarding this. It also inquired regarding how multispecies and multigear work were addressed in the HSWP."
WCPFC18,252,"Australia acknowledged the difficulties in timing work on the various stocks, and indicated that the intent was to stagger the work on skipjack and yellowfin, while noting the relationships between an MP for skipjack and a stock outcome for bigeye, and that the multispecies framework tries to capture some of the relationships and catch outcomes across all those species. Australia stated that WCPFC18-2021-23-rev1 references the need to circle back and look at outcomes for bigeye in the skipjack process. SPC stated that the staggered approach was set up to make the process technically feasible, as SPC cannot address all four WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  51    stocks at same time; South Pacific albacore and skipjack are primarily fished by a single gear, which simplifies the process. SPC stated that SC has talked about the multispecies aspects in the WCPO; the intent is that the MP’s impact on other species can be addressed. SPC noted the HSWP updates noted the issue of checking the multispecies aspects of a management procedure in subsequent years."
WCPFC18,253,"RMI stated that a science-management dialogue would have to take place after SC so that all information could be considered, and noted that a skipjack stock assessment would be prepared in 2022, which would enable a TRP to be considered. Japan stated its understanding was the same regarding the skipjack TRP, and stated it was very hopeful that a harvest strategy for skipjack could be adopted in 2022."
WCPFC18,254,"Following further discussion CCMs agreed to minor modifications to the HSWP, with the understanding that the workplan would be revaluated and adjusted as needed during the 2022 science-management dialogue (discussed in detail under Agenda Item 8.2)."
WCPFC18,255,The Commission noted the presentation by Australia on Updates to the Indicative Harvest Strategy Work Plan (WCPFC18-2021-DP05).
WCPFC18,256,The Commission adopted the updated Indicative Workplan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 (Attachment I).
WCPFC18,257,The Commission noted that a re-evaluation and further discussion of the Indicative Workplan would take place during the Science-Management Dialogue scheduled for 2022.  8.2 Science-Management Dialogue
WCPFC18,258,"The Chair noted that discussions under Agenda Item 8.1 indicated strong support for a science-management dialogue, and invited further discussion regarding the details."
WCPFC18,259,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, welcomed the recommendations from SC to have a science-management dialogue in 2022, noting that this could be viewed as a trial to see whether it is the most effective way to discuss and develop the required harvest strategy recommendations for the Commission. They proposed it be held as part of or adjacent to SC18, with the following focus: • General capacity building to support confident and full participation of all CCMs in decision making on harvest strategies. • The current state of skipjack and South Pacific albacore management strategy evaluation frameworks and candidate management procedures.  • Update and capacity building on the mixed fishery (multispecies) approach. • Two items from SC17 MI-WP-03: o the definition of fisheries and fishery controls within the harvest strategy; o procedures for identifying, selecting and implementing the ’best performing’ management procedure. • Determining how Commission decision-making can best be supported by the SC and the Scientific Services Provider. Developing a ‘pathway’ for supporting decision making on management procedures that fulfills the information and training needs for making informed decisions that balance different management objectives. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  52    • Planning issues, including: Schedule and focus for future dialogue meetings; Updates to the Harvest Strategy Workplan; Discuss alignment of parallel processes (e.g. allocation) required to support implementation of harvest strategies."
WCPFC18,260,"China thanked FFA members for the proposal, and generally concurred with the content and timing. It noted the need to establish trust between scientists and tropical tuna managers. China recommended that there be a focus on general capacity building, and background on how SC recommendations are put forward and how uncertainty is addressed, with the goal of helping industry participants to understand these issues."
WCPFC18,261,"PNG stated they were planning a meeting early in 2022 with industry and would invite SPC and the Secretariat to participate. PNG indicated the PNA and Tokelau’s support for a science-management dialogue to be conducted in 2022 on a trial basis as part of a program to prioritise harvest strategies, and recognizing the limitations imposed by COVID-19. They strongly asserted that WCPFC needs to prioritise harvest strategies in 2022, and to be ready to engage in multiple discussions."
WCPFC18,262,"New Zealand thanked Australia for its work on the Harvest Strategy Workplan and indicated it is fully committed to implementing the workplan.  It noted SC17 had sought advice from WCPFC18 on a number of issues related to the harvest strategy, but that members are not able to make decisions without more detailed discussions in a dedicated forum such as a science-management dialogue. It agreed that it would be appropriate to hold the dialogue after SC18, and stressed the importance of also ensuring that more time is dedicated at the Commission to addressing harvest strategy issues."
WCPFC18,263,"The EU supported holding the science-management dialogue in 2022. In addition to the issues raised by FFA members the EU suggested the dialogue should also consider the specific tasks in the HSWP scheduled for consideration in 2022. It noted the timing of the meeting was more flexible if the meeting was held virtually, and suggested possibly holding two meetings (one in April or May 2022 and a second in conjunction with SC)."
WCPFC18,264,French Polynesia concurred that the harvest strategy work is very important and needs to be given priority that at the Commission’s annual meeting. It suggested CCMs consider holding several dialogue sessions in 2022 and subsequent years.
WCPFC18,265,RMI supported the FFA position and comments by PNG. It supported holding the dialogue in conjunction with SC as this would allow SPC time afterward to prepare for the Commission meeting.
WCPFC18,266,"Australia commented that the science-management dialogue could address the tasks outlined in the HSWP, and noted the need to think about how to structure the dialogue to progress the discussions. It noted the SC needed to agree to operating models for the tuna stocks, which is a new element for SC, and the benefit of holding the dialogue after SC would be that it could provide greater confidence to the discussions, and the dialogue would benefit from presentations and new information on MPs."
WCPFC18,267,"SPC stated it was flexible as to the timing, but that there was merit in holding the science-management dialogue directly after SC, as it would allow SC to discuss new developments, and introduce these to managers through the dialogue; it would also allow time for further work before the Commission meeting."
WCPFC18,268,"Indonesia supported the proposed areas of focus for the science-management dialogue. It expressed concern that sufficient time was needed to enable all CCMs to understand the process. It noted that effectively involving fisheries managers meant including higher-level of officials in the process, which could be challenging, given the general nature of the proposals and focus. Indonesia commented that more clarity was needed on uncertainty in the operating models, which are something of a “black box”. Indonesia WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  53    also expressed its interest in understanding how to translate outcomes for harvest strategy work in their archipelagic waters."
WCPFC18,269,"The EU inquired about an appropriate length for the science-management dialogue. In response SPC indicated that the original plan for the science-management dialogue called for 2 days, and that if held in conjunction with SC, a 2-day meeting would be a realistic initial start to the dialogue process."
WCPFC18,270,The Commission noted the importance and need for a Science-Management Dialogue to expedite the progress of implementation on the Indicative Workplan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies.
WCPFC18,271,"The Commission agreed to have the first Science-Management Dialogue, on a trial basis, back-to-back with SC18 in 2022."
WCPFC18,272,"The Commission supported the following proposed areas of focus for the first Science-Management Dialogue, noting that the drafting the agenda would take into account views of CCMs on the focus of the science-management dialogue: (i) General capacity building to support confident and full participation of all CCMs in decision making on harvest strategies. (ii) The current state of skipjack and South Pacific albacore management strategy evaluation frameworks and candidate management procedures.  (iii) Update and capacity building on the mixed fishery (multispecies) approach. (iv) Two items from SC17 MI-WP-03 which are:  • the definition of fisheries and fishery controls within the harvest strategy; • procedures for identifying, selecting and implementing the ’best performing’ management procedure. (v) Determining how Commission decision-making can best be supported by the SC and the Scientific Services Provider. Developing a ‘pathway’ for supporting decision making on management procedures that fulfills the information and training needs for making informed decisions that balance different management objectives. (vi) Planning issues, including: Schedule and focus for future dialogue meetings; Updates to the Harvest Strategy Workplan; Discuss alignment of parallel processes (e.g., allocation) required to support implementation of harvest strategies.   AGENDA ITEM 9  —REPORTS FROM SUBSIDIARY BODIES AND WORKING GROUPS"
WCPFC18,273,"The Chair noted that reports of the Commission’s subsidiary bodies were taken as read, but that recommendations of subsidiary bodies not addressed under other agenda items would be considered under this agenda item.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  54    9.1 SC17"
WCPFC18,274,The Chair referred the Commission to WCPFC18-2021-SC17: SC17 Summary Report.
WCPFC18,275,"The EU supported adoption of the SC17 report and its associated recommendations. It also recalled the extensive discussion at SC17 on the characterization of uncertainty in stock assessments. It noted as an example that a new approach was used to characterize uncertainty for South Pacific swordfish, which included an ad hoc filtering of model runs, the use of multinomial priors and the inclusion of statistical uncertainty. In the case of the southwest Pacific blue shark, the model grid was not adopted due to issues on the selection of models. The EU noted that the evaluation of risks of falling below LRPs is an essential element in the harvest strategy approach and it is obviously linked to how uncertainty is considered. It stated the importance of seeking consistency in the characterization of uncertainty and of conducting it in the same manner for all key WCPFC stocks. The EU recommended the Commission seek confirmation and advice from the SC on the best approach to be used for characterising uncertainty of stock assessments for key WCPFC stocks and their possible implications, including in terms of reducing uncertainty in management advice."
WCPFC18,276,"Niue, on behalf of FFA members supported adoption of the SC17 report and its recommendations."
WCPFC18,277,The Commission adopted the SC17 Summary Report (WCPFC18-2021-SC17).  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  9.2 TCC17
WCPFC18,278,"The Chair referenced WCPFC18-2021-TCC17: TCC17 Summary Report, WCPFC18-2021-25 Reference paper on TCC17 Recommendations for Agenda Items 9.2 and 9.4, and WCPFC18-2021-26 Draft Best Practice Guidelines for Handling of Cetaceans (the latter was introduced under Agenda Item 4)."
WCPFC18,279,CCMs supported adoption of the TCC17 report and its recommendations.  Commission VMS Issue 1 Disparity between CCM-held and Secretariat-held VMS data
WCPFC18,280,"The Commission noted that there continues to be a disparity between CCM-held and Secretariat-held VMS data, and tasked TCC18 to further consider future work to enable direct/simultaneous VMS reporting by vessels/ALCs reporting to the WCPFC VMS."
WCPFC18,281,"The Commission supported TCC17s’ recommendation and encouraged any CCMs capable of utilising a direct/simultaneous reporting framework to consider doing so on a voluntary basis. Any such CCMs are requested to report their experiences to TCC in the future, particularly any information regarding changes in the number of discrepancies between CCM-held and Secretariat-held VMS data. Issue 2 Data gaps from VMS failure"
WCPFC18,282,"The Commission supported the Secretariat’s continued work within their existing budget to address data gaps from VMS failure, including with interested CCMs on a trial basis**, to facilitate automatic integration of VMS manual reports into the Commission VMS. The Commission tasked the Secretariat to report on their further progress to TCC18. 55    ** Footnote: Ensuring that any VMS manual reports automatically integrated into the Commission VMS are clearly identifiable as manually generated reports, and can be distinguished from non-manually generated VMS positions."
WCPFC18,283,"The Commission tasked TCC18 to consider potential incentives for non-binding measures, including ‘VMS best practices’ that CCMs may adopt to minimise data gaps from VMS failures."
WCPFC18,284,"The Commission approved the extension of the WCPFC9 adopted amendments to the VMS Standards, Specifications and Procedures (SSPs) that were previously extended (via attachment 1 of the SSPs) at WCPFC11, WCPFC13 & WCPFC15, through 1 March 2024, and that this remains in force thereafter unless the Commission directs otherwise (Attachment J).  Issue 3 CCMs’ use of the VMS Reporting Status Tool (VRST)"
WCPFC18,285,The Commission adopted the updated VMS Standard Operating Procedures which incorporate recent changes in technology and technical processes and that are expected to benefit (and reflect) other VMS technical work undertaken by the Secretariat and VMS SWG to address VMS data gaps (Attachment L).   Issue 4 ALC/MTU approval
WCPFC18,286,"The Commission noted TCC17s’ advice that the updated VMS Standard Operating Procedures (Attachment L) include details on  i. the standard processes used to assess the ability of an MTU/ALC and its communication / satellite service provider / gateway to successfully report to the Commission VMS.   ii. how the VMS Manager will work with relevant vendors and CCMs to assess proposals for inclusion of additional MTU/ALC units and their communication / satellite service provider / gateway, against the new MTU/ALC type approval checklist; and iii. how the Secretariat shall provide this information to CCMs, along with any other documentation provided by the flag CCM or vendor, to better inform their consideration of any units proposed for listing or delisting. Issue 5 Assessing compliance with CMM 2014-02 paragraph 9(a) VMS SSP 2.8"
WCPFC18,287,"The Commission noted the issue of assessing compliance with CMM 2014-02 paragraph 9(a) VMS SSPs 2.8 and tasked the Secretariat to provide a report to TCC18 with suggested options and, if practical, an estimated timeline and costs to facilitate electronic (online) submission and processing of new and updated VTAFs. Any process shall track progress transparently with the relevant flag CCM that provides the VTAF."
WCPFC18,288,"The Commission also supported TCC17s’ recommendation and approved, for inclusion as Annex 2 of CMM 2014-02, a streamlined VMS reporting template for use in CCM’s Annual Part 2 Report submissions.  The Commission agreed that the template will be used in 2022, until such time as the Commission’s work developing Audit Points (including for VMS) may be completed (Attachment K).    WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  56    Issue 6 Review of Commission VMS"
WCPFC18,289,"On the issue of the review of the Commission VMS, the Commission tasked the Secretariat to provide further information in the VMS Annual Report to TCC18 on the status of implementing VMS SWG recommendations. Guidelines for the Voluntary Submission of Purse Seine processor data by CCMs to the Commission"
WCPFC18,290,WCPFC18 endorsed the draft guidelines for voluntary submissions of processor (cannery) data to the Commission (Attachment M).
WCPFC18,291,"The Commission tasked the Secretariat to update Table 1 of the 2007 Rules and Procedures for the Protection, Access to, and Dissemination of Data Compiled by the Commission to add “Processor data” as non-public domain (HIGH risk classification) data. Draft Best Practice Guidelines for the Safe Handling and Release of Cetaceans"
WCPFC18,292,The Commission adopted the Best Practice Guidelines for the Safe Handling and Release of Cetaceans (Attachment N) TCC workplan
WCPFC18,293,The Commission approved the updated TCC workplan 2022 – 2024 (Attachment O). Annual Report Part 2 deadline
WCPFC18,294,The Commission noted the workload forecasted for the Secretariat to undertake in 2022 in support of the TCC workplan (WCPFC18-2021-IP12) and agreed to require CCMs in 2022 to submit their Annual Report Part 2 at least 100 days prior to TCC18 (which is a date in mid-June instead of 1 July).
WCPFC18,295,The Commission adopted the TCC17 report (WCPFC18-2021-TCC17).  9.3 NC17
WCPFC18,296,The Chair referred the Commission to WCPFC18-2021-NC17: NC17 Summary Report and WCPFC18-2021-19 Reference Document for the review of CMM 2020-02 and HS 2017-02and Highlights from NC17 for Agenda 9.3. The Chair noted the discussion held on Pacific bluefin tuna under Agenda Item 7.4.
WCPFC18,297,"The NC Chair provided an update on progress on the NC17 proposal to revise the harvest strategy for Pacific bluefin tuna, noting that IATTC adopted the change to the harvest control rule in October 2021."
WCPFC18,298,The Commission adopted the report of NC17 (WCPFC18-2021-NC17).  NC17 Proposed revised Harvest Strategy on Pacific Bluefin Tuna
WCPFC18,299,The Commission adopted the revision to the Harvest Strategy for Pacific Bluefin Tuna Fisheries (Attachment P). WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  57    9.4 Intersessional Working Groups and Intersessional Work 9.4.1  E-Reporting and E-Monitoring (ERandEM IWG)
WCPFC18,300,"The Chair informed the Commission that the Chair of the ERandEM IWG, Ms Kerry Smith of Australia, had tendered her resignation, and conveyed the Commission’s thanks and appreciation to Kerry for her enormous contribution leading the work of the ERandEM IWG for the last several years."
WCPFC18,301,"Australia thanked CCMs for their support for the issues addressed by the ERandEM IWG, and for the support given to Kerry in her role as Chair. Australia stated it would be happy to continuing chairing the WG, and would advise of a nominee in due course."
WCPFC18,302,"FSM on behalf of FFA members thanked Kerry Smith, Chair of the ERandEM IWG, for her work as Chair since the WG was formed by WCPFC11 in 2014. They acknowledged her contribution and effort through the years and wished her all the best in her new endeavour. FFA members supported Australia to continue leading the ERandEM IWG, and reiterated their proposal made during the tropical tuna measure negotiations for the Commission to establish a WCPFC regional electronic monitoring programme by 2023 and to task the ERandEM IWG to undertake the necessary work to meet this deadline.  To this end, FFA members stated the ERandEM IWG should do the necessary work and provide a proposal to TCC18 for its consideration, with a view to adopting EM standards at WCPFC19 in 2022. FFA members stated they are currently working on developing EM standards for implementation within their EEZs, and stated this could assist the work of the ERandEM IWG on this issue."
WCPFC18,303,The Commission expressed appreciation to the previous Chair (Kerry Smith) for her enormous contribution leading the work of the ERandEM IWG for the last several years.
WCPFC18,304,The Commission noted the importance of progressing ERandEM IWG work in 2022.      9.4.2  Transhipment Review (TS IWG)
WCPFC18,305,"The Co-Chairs of the TS-IWG Felix Toa Ngwango (Vanuatu) and Dr. Alex Kahl (USA), provided a brief update of the work of the working group, and referenced its report for WCPFC18 (WCPFC18-2021-TS_IWG). The Co-Chair stated that the TS-IWG was unable to reach consensus on the minimum standard data fields to be collected by transhipment observers."
WCPFC18,306,"Kiribati on behalf of FFA members thanked the Co-Chairs for the update and stated they looked forward to receiving and reviewing the working group’s report in 2022 with the aim to inform the review of the transhipment measure, in order to ensure an appropriate framework is in place to regulate transhipment in the WCPO. They reiterated their proposal made under the tropical tuna measure negotiation for TCC18 to consider the work of the TS-IWG with a view to adopting a revised transhipment measure in 2022. In addition, with regards to the ROP minimum data fields for transhipment at sea, in line with FFA members’ views at TCC17, they suggested that this be sent to the TS-IWG to review the minimum data standards for monitoring of high seas transhipment to be collected by observers. They thanked the TS-IWG Co-Chairs for holding a meeting immediately prior to the start of WCPFC18, which they stated was very useful and productive.  However, the discussion at the IWG highlighted the work remaining to be done in terms of identifying the minimum fields to be collected by observers during transhipment and reiterated their view (shared at TCC17) that the IWG be given ample time to consider this issue and report to TCC18. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  58"
WCPFC18,307,PEW stated that WCPFC18-2021-OP06 A comparative analysis of AIS data with the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Reported transhipment activity in 2019 showed that prior to COVID-19 the WCPFC was the only RFMO where transhipment increased. It noted that the recommendations being considered by the Commission did not specify what data should be submitted to the Commission. The Co-Chair (USA) stated that the discussions in the IWG supported not specifying requirements regarding what data would be covered until standard data fields had been adopted.
WCPFC18,308,The Commission noted the intersessional progress report by the Review of the Transhipment CMM IWG (WCPFC18-2021-TS_IWG).
WCPFC18,309,The Commission supported the TS-IWG continuing its review of CMM 2009-06 in 2022.
WCPFC18,310,The Commission reminds members that ROP transhipment data should be submitted to the Secretariat where possible within 120 days of the observer disembarking the receiving vessel.    9.4.3  Crew labour standards
WCPFC18,311,"The Co-Chairs of the intersessional work to improve crew labour standards, Ms. Putuh Suadela (Indonesia) and Ms. Emma Hodder (New Zealand), introduced WCPFC18-2021-DP07. Update from Co-chairs on Intersessional work to improve crew labour standards. In December 2020 the Commission agreed to undertake intersessional work to improve crew labour standards, led by the Co-Chairs. Work commenced in February 2021 with multiple rounds of email feedback and a virtual workshop in July. An update was provided to TCC in September 2021. TCC17 recommended that the work continue on improving crew labour standards and an update be provided to WCPFC18. The Co-Chairs thanked members of the IWG for their excellent feedback to date, noting significant progress as included in WCPFC18-2021-DP07. While good progress was made, they noted areas that require further discussion and looked forward to working with members to further progress the work in 2022."
WCPFC18,312,"Solomon Islands, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the Co-Chairs for leading the intersessional work throughout 2021. FFA Members noted that while good progress had been made, significant work remains. FFA members stated they remain committed to finalising the draft CMM and looked forward to the next meeting of the IWG, scheduled for early in 2022. FFA members recognised that this is a complex matter for many delegations, particularly because of its cross-cutting nature, and appreciated that differing views remained, both in terms of process and substance, but were encouraged that so many CCMs were willing to address the issue.  They stated their hope that all CCMs could do this and thus work through their differences, and build on the contributions so many delegations had already made.  FFA members stated they consider the matter serious and that all CCMs, and particularly large fleets, have a key role to play in taking steps to address this issue. FFA Members noted that the New Zealand Co-Chair, Ms Emma Hodder, would be leaving that role in early January, thanks her for her work, and looked forward to working with her successor in this role."
WCPFC18,313,Korea stated that the issue is very important and fully supported further work.
WCPFC18,314,"China stated it remained concerned that the draft CMM goes beyond the mandate of the Commission, and that because of this it did not participate in the intersessional work in 2021. China stated they were nonetheless very attentive to the issue, and in March 2021 China established an important regulation concerning foreign crew working on China’s fishing vessels. It expressed concerns about some elements of the current draft, and questioned how the CMM could be implemented, in view of the large number of outstanding cases in the CCFS whose resolution relies on information from observer programs. China stated it would participate in the intersessional work starting in 2022.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  59"
WCPFC18,315,"The USA thanked the Co-Chairs for leading the work, which it stated is essential; it noted the steps taken by the Commission regarding observer safety, and stated vessel crew should receive no less. The USA stated it was encouraged China would participate, and looked forward to jointly finding solutions, and hopefully having a CMM for adoption in 2022."
WCPFC18,316,"Canada stated it continued to be supportive of the work, and agreed it should be feasible to have a draft CMM ready in 2022."
WCPFC18,317,Cook Islands on behalf of FFA members welcomed the positive and constructive engagement from China and stated it appreciated the opportunity to work with them in 2022.
WCPFC18,318,"WWF expressed its sincere appreciation to the Crew Welfare intersessional work participants and the leadership of New Zealand and Indonesia in chairing that group and emphatically supported advancing this important work.  They offered particular thanks to New Zealand’s outgoing Co-Chair for her commitment and welcomed the new Co-Chair. They also thanked those members who participated diligently in the intersessional work, noting that it is an indication of the importance of the issue that very small fisheries ministries such as those in Nauru, Tokelau, and Tuvalu recognise the gravity of the issue and, despite limited resources and small teams, maintained engagement in the intersessional work at every step.  WWF noted that seemingly as with climate change, small islands have taken on the burden of fixing a problem that they have not caused or contributed to. WWF expressed its hope that larger CCMs with well-resourced ministries that did not meaningfully engage in 2021 would follow through on their commitment to do so in 2022. WWF noted some flag states are taking independent steps to address the issue at a national level and encouraged and supported those further measures, but stated that the intersessional work and the supporting analyses WWF submitted (e.g., WCPFC18-2021-OP09) solidly lay out the authority of the WCPFC and the necessary steps to address matters of crew welfare, and that the WCPFC has the authority and the obligation to address crew welfare through a binding CMM. WWF looked forward to significant progress, culminating in an agreed CMM in 2022."
WCPFC18,319,The Commission noted the report of the crew labour standards intersessional work as presented in joint Delegation Paper (WCPFC18-2021-DP07) by Indonesia and New Zealand.
WCPFC18,320,The Commission supported the continuation of the crew labour standards intersessional work led by Indonesia and New Zealand in 2022.   AGENDA ITEM 10  —  COMPLIANCE MONITORING SCHEME  10.1 Consideration and Adoption of the Final Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR)
WCPFC18,321,"The Commission, pursuant to CMM 2019-06, considered the provisional CMR recommended by TCC17. A CMR-SWG, led by the TCC Chair, compiled the final CMR for adoption. The TCC Chair provided a report on the CMR-SWG outcomes."
WCPFC18,322,The Commission noted that there were ongoing difficulties related to interpretation of the term “actively fishing for” (and similar terms such as “directed at” and “targeting”) in CMM 2015-02 which continue to present challenges and makes it difficult for TCC to complete the assessments of some obligations during the CMR.  The Commission also noted that the disparities in available operational-level data for determined baseline periods raised difficulties in undertaking compliance assessments as WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  60    this results in some limits being based on analysis of operational-level data and other limits being based on self-reporting.
WCPFC18,323,"The Commission noted the issued raised during discussions of CMM 2015-02 and emphasized the importance of ensuring that CMMs are clear in their application, and are able to be monitored and enforced. WCPFC18 requested the South Pacific Albacore Roadmap IWG take note of this in consideration of its future work."
WCPFC18,324,The Commission adopted the Final Compliance Monitoring Report (Attachment Q).  10.2 Work to progress the CMS future work included in Section IX of CMM 2019-06 Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS-IWG)
WCPFC18,325,The Chair noted the recommendations from TCC17 for the WCPFC18 consideration and decision as set out in working paper WCPFC18-2021-28. Secretariat. Reference document for TCC17 Recommendations for Agenda 10.
WCPFC18,326,"The Chair of the CMS-IWG presented a brief update on the work of the CMS-IWG, as summarized in WCPFC18-2021-29. Draft CMS-IWG Workplan. The CMS-IWG noted that the workplan was developed in consultation with the Secretariat and the respective Leads on the development of a risk-based assessment framework (RBAF) (Ms. Heather Ward, New Zealand) and the development of audit points (Ms Rhea Moss Christian, RMI), noting that the objective of the workplan is to develop a clear timeline of the anticipated work of the CMS IWG in order to complete the tasks included in the CMS future work plan, as outlined in Section IX of CMM 2019-06. In addition, the Secretariat developed a dedicated webpage to support the organization and work of the CMS-IWG on the WCPFC website; all papers related to the work of the CMS-IWG, including those related to the elements of the workplan, will be made available on the CMS-IWG webpage."
WCPFC18,327,"Tuvalu on behalf of FFA members thanked the Chair of the CMS-IWG and the Leads for audit points and the RBAF for the draft CMS-IWG workplan. They recognized with appreciation the effort that the Chair and the Leads had put into this work in the short period of time they led the work in 2021.  They noted the draft work plan is very thorough, well prepared, and addresses all the elements under CMS future work in Section IX of CMM 2019-06. FFA members supported the draft work plan but noted that much of the work is scheduled to be done intersessionally, which can be problematic for small national administrations with many other regional and national obligations.  They noted that ideally time would be made available during TCC18 to advance this work. In addition, FFA members supported the TCC17 recommendations regarding streamlining of Annual Reporting and improving the online CCFS and reiterated their thanks to the Secretariat for its work on these aspects of the CMS."
WCPFC18,328,"Tokelau, also on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau, supported the FFA statement. They expressed support for the activities in the workplan, but noted that it involves a substantial amount of work, much of it intersessional. They noted other WCPFC, PNA and national priorities in 2022, including Harvest Strategy work. They also noted that this is difficult because experience has shown that is hard to participate in intersessional working groups; together with the weaknesses in the CMS CMM and factors such as the partial availability of observer data for the CMS and the reduction in data from high seas boarding and inspection activities, PNA and Tokelau considered it would be better to address the activities in the workplan at TCC, rather than undertaking a much weaker CMS process at TCC."
WCPFC18,329,China supported holding the CMS-IWG in conjunction with TCC. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  61
WCPFC18,330,The Commission noted the presentation by the TCC Vice-Chair on the work to progress CMS future work and the draft work plan for the CMS-IWG (WCPFC18-2021-28).
WCPFC18,331,"The Commission noted the intersessional progress report on the work to develop a Risk-Based Assessment Framework (RBAF) to assist CCMs to prioritise obligations for inclusion in the annual CMS, based on the risk of non-compliance of achieving CMM objectives (WCPFC18-2021-CMS-RBAF)."
WCPFC18,332,The Commission noted that the CMS-IWG workplan will be modified intersessionally to take into account the approach to the Commission’s Compliance Monitoring Scheme in 2022 and 2023. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  10.3 Expiry of CMM 2019-06
WCPFC18,333,The Chair stated that the Commission needed to consider a successor measure to ensure the continued operation of the CMS beyond the expiry of CMM 2019-06 on 31 December 2021.
WCPFC18,334,"The EU supported a rollover of the CMS measure.  It noted that WCPFC18 had been working on developing the list of obligations to be reviewed in 2022, and stated that given the time constraints at WCPFC18, there was no option other than renewing the CMS CMM."
WCPFC18,335,"FSM on behalf of FFA members stated they recognized and fully appreciated the importance of a CMS in order to ensure that CCMs implement and comply with obligations arising under the Convention and CMMs, including to assess CCMs’ compliance with their WCPFC obligations, identify areas in which technical assistance or capacity building may be needed to assist CCMs in attaining compliance, identify aspects of CMMs which may require refinement or amendment for effective implementation, respond to non-compliance by CCMs through remedial and/or preventative options, and monitor and resolve outstanding instances of non-compliance by CCMs with their WCPFC obligations. They noted that the first scheme was adopted by WCPFC7 in 2010 through CMM 2010-06 and had undergone many iterations.  FFA members stated that 2021 was the eleventh year that the CMS has been in place, and stated they have consistently voiced their concern that the scheme is flawed in ways that results in disproportionate burden on SIDS. FFA members stated that prior to the CMS coming into force in 2011, they had actively managed the fishery in their waters by putting robust measures in place and would continue to do so, irrespective of the CMS.  They stated that one of the flaws — not necessarily as a result of the CMS, but of the management framework of the Commission — is that while FFA members have been rigorously managing the fisheries in-zone, the management framework in the high seas requires much improvement.  They also noted the imbalance between the measure in place for purse seine vs longline fisheries. FFA members stated that Section IX of the CMS measure commits the Commission to a multi-year workplan of tasks to enhance the scheme, with the aim of making it more efficient and effective by streamlining the processes.  FFA members stated they had been in the forefront of trying to progress some of this work, including in 2021. They stated that in their view in 2021 the Commission and TCC need to put aside dedicated time to progress these tasks in order to enhance the CMS and address its current flaws"
WCPFC18,336,"Tokelau, also on behalf of the PNA, stated that the CMS is flawed in ways that reduces its value to them. They noted that they have committed substantial effort to reforming the CMS, especially in moving away from vessel-level compliance and through improvements to the CCFS. They suggested it is clearly very difficult to complete the work in a COVID setting while carrying on the CMS business as usual, and that 2022 would provide an opportunity to complete the work needed on the CMS by putting aside the CMR review for 2022 and working instead on the reforms. They noted that the CMS depends heavily on observer data, and with the suspension of observer obligations the observer data available will be even more biased because there will be more reports for fleets that have voluntarily made the special effort of continuing to  62    carry observers. There will also be less information from high seas boarding and inspection reports. They noted that a shortened virtual TCC session, as in 2021, leaves little time for anything other than core business if there is a full CMS review, while the CMS-IWG workplan clearly shows how much work there is to be done, including work on Audit Points, the RBAF, use of the aggregated summary tables, trial of CCFS improvements, and revising CMM 2019-06. In the workplan, much intersessional work is planned, but SIDS are disadvantaged in participation in intersessional processes. Focusing on finishing the work on the CMS at TCC18 would enable the important tasks in the workplan to be completed effectively, in a way that would also allow more effective SIDS participation. PNA and Tokelau stated that for that reason, they did not support rolling over or extending the CMM in its current form."
WCPFC18,337,"The USA stated their view that it is essential that the Commission have a robust CMS in place in 2022. The USA noted it had been very involved in this for over a decade and had worked to make the necessary adjustments to ensure it works well for the Commission. It stated that the CMS is a fundamental requirement of the Commission, and that it was unacceptable that it be put aside for a year; it would mean that the WCPFC would be the sole RFMO without a CMS. The USA acknowledged that much work needs to be done, and stated that being able to work intersessionally was essential. It expressed a willingness to extend TCC to conduct both the CMR and do the other work, and stated it was prepared to engage in any of the working groups, and take on leadership roles where others think the USA could be helpful. It emphasized it could not agree to not having a CMS in 2022, as this would harm the integrity of the Commission, and was not an acceptable way forward. It stressed the need to have a CMS and still make good progress on the other needed work."
WCPFC18,338,"Canada stated its understanding of the Commission’s challenging position, and supported the remarks by the USA."
WCPFC18,339,"The EU supported the views expressed by the USA, stating it would not be acceptable to have a one-year gap with no CMR review. The EU suggested it was disrespectful to suggest CCMs should work on the list of obligations but then be informed some CCMs were not willing to conduct the review in 2022 in any event, and stated it would have been more honest to have this made clear from the outset of WCPFC18. It emphasized that it was essential that the CMR be reviewed in 2022."
WCPFC18,340,"PNG stressed that as the chair of the PNA when statements were made on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau it was after a lengthy process and considered discussions and reflections. They stated that they sought to engage in an open and honest process, and were always very clear when CMMs were not working for them, and sought balance in terms of their responses, actions and engagement. They stated they did not accept that it is incumbent on the Commission to prepare a CMR, and stated that prior to the trial of the CMS, CCMs engaged in Part 2 reporting. They acknowledged mutual accountability for the CMMs that are agreed to, but stated it is not necessarily a core function of the Commission to have a CMR or a CMS. They looked forward to progressing to a system that works for all CCMs."
WCPFC18,341,"Tuvalu supported the statement made by Tokelau, noting that the Commission is reforming the CMS, but the work was not complete as a result of COVID-19 and tropical tuna measure negotiations. It suggested 2022 would provide opportunity to complete the work needed on the CMS by putting aside the CMR; noting the case for doing that was strengthened by the reduced observer and boarding and inspection report data for 2021, the volume of tasks in the CMS Workplan, and the Secretariat’s workload. They supported not having a CMR review in 2022 and instead focusing on undertaking some of the work in the CMS-IWG workplan."
WCPFC18,342,"Korea supported the interventions from the USA and the EU, and advocated extending the current CMS for at least one year.   WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  63"
WCPFC18,343,"Australia suggested that both compliance obligations and the CMS revisions were of critical importance, and noted strong support for the intersessional work outlined. It supported the statements made by FFA, and suggested looking at how the Commission could advance the needed work to revise the CMS while respecting the Commission’s compliance obligations. It suggested an alternative needed to be found to a simple rollover of the CMS CMM, and suggested the need to specifically state what would be undertaken in 2022."
WCPFC18,344,"Tokelau noted that its participation in efforts to test the list of obligations and RBAF were separate from a decision on the CMS CMM, and CMR requirements for 2022. It noted that the Convention addresses compliance review, but that this is not necessarily an annual review. Tokelau stated it wanted to ensure that the CMS and CMR are fair and effective."
WCPFC18,345,"New Zealand stated that the CMS is an essential mechanism to hold CCMs to account and deter noncompliance, and voiced its commitment to improving the effectiveness of the CMS, including through the RBAF. It supported the comments from Australia, and stated that if there was no CMR process in 2022, other key processes should continue. It stated its preference would be for TCC18 to have the scope to both substantively address the CMS work program and a CMR, but if that did not take place, elements of the CMR (such as CCM reporting) should continue in 2022 to ensure ongoing accountability for CCMs."
WCPFC18,346,"ISSF stated its deep concern that the extension of the CMS measure was in jeopardy, as this would mean the WCPFC would have no CMS, which would make the WCPFC the only RFMO without a CMS. ISSF stated that this would place the Commission in breach of the Convention, UNFSA, and other obligations.  It stated that in the absence of a mechanism to assess the level of compliance CMMs would lose their value, sending a strong signal that would reduce public and market confidence. It strongly urged CCMs to reconsider their positions and extend the CMS at WCPFC18."
WCPFC18,347,"The Ocean Foundation supported the intervention by ISSF, noting that the CMS CMM is one of the Commission’s most important measures. It stated that the WCPFC is the largest RFMO in terms of catches under management, and that this would raise fundamental issues with regard to whether CMMs are achieving their intended objectives. It stressed that the important work of compliance assessment must continue. It agreed with the need to move as quickly as possible to address the issues identified with regard to the CMS, but stated that an imperfect measure is better than no measure at all."
WCPFC18,348,"Pew supported the comments by ISSF and Ocean Foundation. It stated that IATTC in 2020 shocked the tuna world by almost having no tuna measure, and that for WCPFC to have no CMS would be akin to that. Pew stated that it was well aware that the current CMS was far from perfect, but having no CMS would be worse. It stated that not renewing the CMS would be viewed with great concern."
WCPFC18,349,"RMI stated that in its current form the CMS is unfair and prejudiced SIDS, and that they derive no value from the process. It advocated fixing the problems prior to approval of another CMS CMM."
WCPFC18,350,"The Chair encouraged CCMs to consider the suggestions by Australia and New Zealand, and encouraged CCMs to find a middle ground that accommodated all concerns expressed."
WCPFC18,351,"In the course of further discussions, CCMs agreed that they had joint obligations with respect to the Convention and the Commission’s CMMs, and that review of compliance with these obligations is an essential function of the Commission. CCMs also agreed on the need to devote additional time in 2022 at TCC18 to progressing revisions of the CMS and CMR. CCMs agreed to extend the CMS CMM by two years (until 31 December 2023), and to defer the CMR process in 2022 to allow consideration of revisions to the CMS and the CMR process.  WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  64"
WCPFC18,352,"The Commission agreed that the Commission’s Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMM 2019-06) would continue in force for until 31 December 2023 (CMM 2021-03, Attachment R), with the following amendments: i. The Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR) assessment review process (provisional CMR and final CMR process), including the review of the aggregate tables, shall be deferred in 2022 so that the Technical and Compliance Committee can dedicate appropriate time to the completion of CMS Future Work components (Section IX); ii. TCC18 shall focus on completing the development of audit points, a risk-based assessment framework and the development of guidelines for observer participation in the CMS and provide recommendations to WCPFC19 to support WCPFC19’s adoption of these work areas. TCC18 shall also continue to consider: a. the process for reviewing the aggregated information referred to in paragraph 26(ii); b. the other components of the CMS Future Work;  c. further improvements to the compliance case file system; and d. appropriate compliance assessment decision making processes. iii. WCPFC19 shall adopt audit points and a risk-based assessment framework for use in the 2023 CMR review; iv. Notwithstanding subparagraph i) in 2022 and 2023, CCMs shall submit Annual Reports Part 1 and 2, Scientific data to be submitted to the Commission and Fished and Did not Fish report (CMM 2018-06 09); and v. In 2023, TCC19 shall consider a CMR that assesses CCMs’ compliance over the previous 2 year reporting period (RY2021 and RY2022) using the agreed audit point and risk-based assessment framework adopted by WCPFC19.   10.4 List of obligations to be reviewed by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme in 2022"
WCPFC18,353,"The Chair of the List of Obligations SWG, Ms Heather Ward (NZ) summarised the outcomes of the SWG, noting that the SWG had agreed on a total of 60 obligations to be assessed in 2022."
WCPFC18,354,"Tokelau, also on behalf of the PNA, supported the list recommended by the SWG."
WCPFC18,355,"The Commission agreed to the List of Obligations to guide the preparation by the Secretariat of the draft CMR in 2022, covering 2021 activities (Attachment S).   AGENDA ITEM 11  — ADOPTION OF THE 2022 IUU VESSEL LIST"
WCPFC18,356,"The Chair introduced WCPFC18-2021-30: WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2022, which presented for the consideration of WCPFC18 the relevant information for a decision on the 2022 WCPFC IUU Vessel List, in accordance with CMM 2019-07.   WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  65"
WCPFC18,357,"Kiribati on behalf of FFA members supported the retention of the three fishing vessels NEPTUNE, FU LIEN No.1 and YU FONG 168 on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2022. They stated that at TCC17, FFA members requested Chinese Taipei to respond to specific questions relating to the three vessels. The questions were conveyed to Chinese Taipei during TCC17 and are reflected in the TCC17 Summary Report. FFA members stated that they looked forward to receiving a response. In addition, they sought specific information from Panama in relation to their registration of the vessel FU LIEN NO.1 (IMO: 7355662), noting that during TCC17 Panama indicated that the vessel was no longer registered under the Panama Registry. FFA Members asked Panama to specify the period when the vessel was registered under the Panama Registry."
WCPFC18,358,"Panama stated it consulted with the Maritime Authority of Panama, the Institution in charge of flag registrations, and on September 24, 2021 they certified that there is no evidence of registration of the vessel in question under the Panamanian flag. Panama stated that if the Secretariat required, Panama could provide the documentation in English."
WCPFC18,359,The Commission agreed to maintain the three vessels currently on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List and adopted the 2021 WCPFC IUU Vessel List (Attachment T).    IUU Cross Listing
WCPFC18,360,The Chair noted that the EU’s proposal WCPFC18-2021-DP03 rev3 Proposal for amending CMM 2019-07 (WCPFC IUU Vessel List) was introduced under Agenda Item
WCPFC18,361,"The EU stated that in addition to Canada, Japan, and Chinese Taipei, Korea had joined as a co-sponsor. It thanked the co-sponsors and other CCMs for their comments, which it stated had helped improve the proposed text"
WCPFC18,362,"Canada, Chinese Taipei, Japan and Korea stated their support for the proposal, noting that in their view it would benefit all CCMs. They asked CCMs to consider the intent of the proposal, and noted that the practice has been adopted by all other RFMOs."
WCPFC18,363,"Fiji, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the proponents. They stated that since 2019, FFA members have raised concerns regarding cross listing, and have noted that the proposal for cross-listing would have significantly more impact on national administrations than suggested by the EU, without any material benefit in their effort to combat IUU fishing in the WCPO.  At WCPFC16 FFA members requested the EU to provide a proper analysis of the administrative, institutional and legal implications of cross-listing.  FFA members stated they were again requesting that the EU respond to questions raised regarding the implications of the proposal. FFA members stated they had repeatedly called for complete and accurate CMM 2013-06 assessments, and that if the CMM 2013-06 assessment is not complete and accurate, then it is not acceptable. They stated that the CMM 2013-06 assessment provided in WCPFC18-2021-DP03 states there will be no additional resources required, including financial and human capacity, to implement the proposal.  FFA members stated their view that this is inaccurate given the additional administrative burden on members and the Secretariat. FFA members stated they are not in a position to support the proposed amendments to CMM 2019-07 and invited the EU to consider whether there are other cooperative approaches that can be taken to support efforts to combat IUU fishing."
WCPFC18,364,"China stated that it is member of other tuna RFMOS, which have adopted similar measures, and thus it generally supported the concept. However, China stated that after about 4 years during which cross listing has been implemented by other RFMOs, two problems had emerged. One is legal: there are a number WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  66    of RFMOs of which China is not a member, and in those cases it is difficult for China to take action, noting that this was the case for CCSBT. China also noted difficulties associated with de-listings, and whether the process would be undertaken automatically under the EU’ proposal. It noted that these practical issues made it difficult for China to support the proposal, and suggested the EU consider removing CCSTB from the list of RFMOs whose IUU vessel lists would be cross listed."
WCPFC18,365,"Palau stated it lacked staff capacity to undertake the required work, and stated it and other members of PNA and Tokelau could not support the proposal. It noted the proposal’s CMM 2013-06 assessment ignored the obligations of paragraph 22."
WCPFC18,366,"The EU stated it would be open to seeking accommodation of specific issues such as that raised by China. Regarding comments by the PNA and Tokelau, it stated that it had sought to demonstrate in its submission the proposal would reduce rather than increase the burden placed on small administrations."
WCPFC18,367,"Cook Islands supported the comments from Palau, stating these were consistent with the comments from FFA members, and had been expressed for several years. It urged the EU to understand that small administrations are in a very different position from large ones, and that the proposal would require a substantial change in the way small administrations operate. It stated that SIDS have the need and right to target their resources in ways that have the most impact, and that they do this with the support and assistance of the FCC secretariat. Cook Islands stated that their approach is working, and that they would be willing to discuss other ways to cooperate on the IUU vessel issue."
WCPFC18,368,"The EU thanked the co-sponsors of is proposal for their support and constructive contributions, while noting that the following statement was made strictly on behalf the EU delegation. It stated disappointment that despite the efforts, outreach and assessments undertaken during the last two years the proposal was not adopted due to the opposition of FFA. The EU stated it was very concerned that CMM 2013-06 was advocated as an argument for opposing the proposal. It noted the lack of common understanding or clear process about the requirements of CMM 2013-06, and stated that it proactively reached out to the FFA and individual FFA members intersessionally on several occasions, especially during 2021, seeking feedback and guidance for the assessment, but that very little if any feedback was received, including at WCPFC18. The EU stated that in the absence of willingness from FFA members to engage with the EU delegation, advocating CMM 2013-06 in this context was unjustified, and that by doing so FFA members were taking the risk of undermining the scope and initial intent of that CMM. It stated that various funding opportunities for capacity building were available that could possibly assist SIDS to overcome any difficulties related to the implementation of a cross listing procedure that could be identified, and noted that the CMS itself provides opportunities through the Capacity Assistance status to provide support to SIDS that might face implementation challenges with specific WCPFC obligations. At WCPFC18 FFA members supported another proposal on the basis that the amendments proposed were already adopted by FFA and included in its Harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions for Access by Fishing Vessels. The EU stated that it found it striking that FFA has already adopted the cross-listing principle in Annex 4 of its Harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions for Access by Fishing Vessels (MTCs) that state “The Director-General is required to review IUU Vessel Lists as a background check on each vessel that is the subject of an application for registration. An application for registrations from any fishing vessel which is listed in any of the following IUU lists shall be rejected”. The EU Stated that despite this FFA members remained unwilling to support the proposal for introducing cross-listing in WCPFC, and that the main question was why FFA members opposed a measure they have adopted internally, which undermines the constructive efforts of WCPFC members to improve the capacity of WCPFC to fight against IUU in the WCPO and at global level. The EU stated that it believes this outstanding question deserves at least an honest answer."
WCPFC18,369,"The Cook Islands responded to the EU’s statement highlighting that the FFA had made several constructive attempts over many years to explain their concerns to the EU. The Cook Islands expressed that WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  67    it was unfortunate, unfair and offensive for the EU to suggest that the FFA had not been constructive, or that the FFA was not committed to combatting IUU fishing simply because of a disagreement on the administrative and institutional utility of their proposal. The Cook Islands highlighted the success of the FFA’s cooperative efforts to combat IUU fishing.  The Cook Islands further identified that capacity building needs should be identified by SIDS, not by other CCMs who direct capacity building to support their own objectives rather than SIDS’ objectives."
WCPFC18,370,Palau fully supported the statement by Cook Islands.   AGENDA ITEM 12  — REPORT OF FAC15 12.1 Report of the Fifteenth Finance and Administration Committee
WCPFC18,371,The FAC Co-Chair Mr. Michael Brakke (USA) reported the key highlights and recommendations of FAC15 and referenced the Summary Report (WCPFC18-2021-FAC15).
WCPFC18,372,"RMI on behalf of PNA and Tokelau raised concern about the process used by FAC to prioritise SC projects for funding, as addressed in paragraph 30 of the FAC15 Summary Report, and stated that their preference in the future would be for FAC to adhere to the project priorities as determined by SC."
WCPFC18,373,The EU supported comment from the PNA and Tokelau. 12.2 Budget Approval for 2022 and Indicative Budgets for 2023 and 2024
WCPFC18,374,"The Commission considered the budget recommended by the FAC. After further deliberation, the Commission decided to fund the six intersessional working groups that will be held virtually in the amount of $68,000 and the Science Manager Dialog that will be held for two days after SC in the amount of $94,500. With these changes, the Commission adopted a budget of $8,471,636 for 2022."
WCPFC18,375,"The Commission endorsed the FAC15 recommendation in paragraph 9 of the FAC15 Summary Report, and accepted the audited financial statements for 2020 (WCPFC18-2021-FAC15-05)."
WCPFC18,376,"The Commission noted the deferment of further discussion on Professional Staff Salary to FAC16, when an updated tri-annual salary market review will be available, and encouraged the informal small working group led by Cook Islands to continue its deliberations intersessionally with a view towards helping to inform an appropriate consensus outcome on this issue at FAC16."
WCPFC18,377,"The Commission adopted the report of the Fifteenth Session of the FAC (WCPFC18-2021FAC15), noting the proposed 2022 budget of $ 8,309,136 and indicative budgets for 2023 and 2024 of $ 8,505,480 and $ 8,374,893 respectively (Attachment U)."
WCPFC18,378,"The Commission further considered the budget recommended by the FAC. After further deliberation, the Commission decided to fund the six intersessional working groups that will be held virtually in the amount of $68,000 and the Science Manager Dialogue that will be held for two days after SC in the amount of $94,500. With these changes, the Commission adopted a budget of $8,471,636 for 2022."

WCPFC18,380,"The Commission made a number of appointments to Commission positions commencing after the end of WCPFC18 (8 December 2021): i. Dr Tuikolongahau Halafihi, CEO of the Ministry of Fisheries of the Kingdom of Tonga was appointed SC Chair; and  ii. Mr Michael Brakke (United States) was reappointed, and David Power (Australia) was appointed to serve as FAC Co-Chairs."
WCPFC18,381,"In support of 2022 Intersessional activities, to be progressed electronically, the Commission confirmed the following: i. Ms Neomai Ravitu (Fiji) would continue to lead the South Pacific Albacore Roadmap IWG;  ii. Australia would continue to lead the ERandEMWG, name to be advised; iii.

Ms Heather Ward (New Zealand) would continue to lead the risk-based assessment framework task and Ms Rhea Moss-Christian (RMI) would continue to lead the development of audit points in support of the CMS IWG Chair."
WCPFC18,382,"The Chair noted that the positions of Vice-Chair for the SC, ROP-IWG Chair and CDS-IWG Chair remain vacant and that nominations for these positions would be invited intersessionally in 2022.  13.2 Future Meetings"
WCPFC18,383,"The EU commented that when scheduling future online meetings, should these be required, that a lesson to draw from the WCPFC meetings held during 2021 is that the sessions as scheduled provided insufficient time to conduct the needed work. This required that many meeting days be extended with very short notice, which the EU stated proved difficult for its delegation, and possibly for others. The EU suggested that the Commission agree to include additional sessions in future virtual meetings to address this concern. WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  69"
WCPFC18,384,The Commission acknowledged that with the COVID-19 pandemic likely to continue into 2022 it was difficult to predict the feasibility of convening physical meetings next year.
WCPFC18,385,"In the event that physical meetings for 2022 are feasible the Commission agreed on the following meeting venues and dates:   i. SC18 would be held in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia from Wednesday 10 to Thursday 18 August 2022; ii. The First Science-Management Dialogue would be held in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia Friday 19 and Monday 22 August 2022; iii. NC18 would be held in Japan (venue and date to be advised); iv. TCC18 would be held in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia from Wednesday 21 to Tuesday 27 September 2022; v. WCPFC19 would be held in Vietnam in December 2022, with dates to be confirmed by Vietnam in consultation with Secretariat.  3. In the event that physical meetings for 2022 are not feasible, the expedited decision-making procedure used in 2020 and 2021 will also be used to facilitate each decision by the Commission to convene virtual meetings in 2022     13.3 Timeline for recruitment of a new Executive Director"
WCPFC18,386,The Finance and Administration Manager explained the process and timeline for recruitment of a new Executive Director.  4. The Commission agreed to the timeline for the recruitment of a new Executive Director for WCPFC set out in WCPFC18-2021-31 (Attachment W).   AGENDA ITEM 14  — OTHER MATTERS
WCPFC18,387,The Chair noted that the delegation from Ecuador submitted the following statement for the consideration of WCPFC18.
WCPFC18,388,"Ecuador conveyed the greetings of the Government of Ecuador, wished success in the deliberations of WCPFC, and expressed appreciation to the members of the WCPFC for renewing Ecuador’s CNM status, which has been granted since 2009. Ecuador recalled its commitment to fully comply with the Commission’s CMMs and all administrative and financial obligations, and stated that it has done this. It also expressed its support to:  (i) enforce tropical tuna conservation and management measures for all fleets that limits fishing mortality for bigeye, yellowfin, and skipjack;  (ii) adopt a work plan for FADs with a timeframe to transition from traditional FADs to primarily FADs made primarily from biodegradable materials; and develop FAD recovery policies, marking procedures, and ownership rules; (iii) adopt target reference points for bigeye and yellowfin;  (iv) adopt a CMM for an Electronic Observers’ Monitoring Program and Minimum Standards for the use of electronic monitoring in all WCPFC fisheries; and  (v) continue the work towards reforming at-sea transhipment CMM and CMS.   WCPFC18 Summary Report Issued: 13 April 2022  70"
WCPFC18,389,"Ecuador stated it has expressed its desire to become full member of WCPFC at several WCPFC annual meetings, but that unfortunately, Ecuador's request has not been well received. Given this, Ecuador officially asked what the legal procedure would be to achieve that objective, aspiring that it should be clear, fair, and transparent. It recalled that at WCPFC14 the USA delivered a discussion document on this issue, and that it had also been raised by the EU. It noted that their analysis would facilitate the delayed treatment that has been given to this important matter. It noted that in 2015 WCPFC took a first step by implementing a change in the “CNM application form”, in which candidate countries were asked whether they would like to become full members. In this regard, Ecuador inquired again what the benefit of this question is, and if there had been any follow-up. It reminded CCMs that the general framework of RFMOs states that no State or group of States that have a real interest in the fisheries should be discriminated against, and that Ecuador and most members of the WCPFC are parties to UNCLOS and the UNFSA, which are pillars of the international legal framework for fishing and the oceans. In this regard, Ecuador considers that officially and repeatedly informing WCPFC of its interest in becoming a “full member” while receiving no response constitutes discrimination and a violation of the UNCLOS and UNFSA rules. It noted the foregoing contrasts with the treatment given to states in other RFMOs. By way of example, following adoption of the new IATTC Convention in Antigua, Guatemala in 2003, the IATTC accepted several coastal states not located in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (e.g., Belize, the People's Republic of China, and Kiribati) to become full members with no barrier. Ecuador reiterated its request that the Commission consider establishing a framework and conditions to allow interested CNMs to become full Members.

WCPFC19,8,"Dr. Tran Dinh Luan, Director General of the Directorate of Fisheries of the Government of Vietnam provided the Keynote Address. On behalf of the leaders of the Directorate of Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Vietnam, he warmly welcomed delegates attending WCPFC1"
WCPFC19,9,"He observed that Vietnam is located in a part of the Pacific region with rich and diverse biological resources. Vietnam's fisheries industry, which is developed with a focus on small-scale, multi-specialty and multi-species fisheries is gradually transforming, with increased aquaculture production and reduced catches. Total fisheries production in November 2022 was estimated at 8.2 million tons, with a catch volume of about 3.5 million tons and aquaculture production of 4.6 million tons. In the first 10 months of 2022, fisheries export turnover reached $9.4 billion USD. He stated that Vietnam's capture fisheries have developed rapidly but faced many difficulties and challenges. He noted that Vietnam’s goals include maintaining the sustainable development of the fishery industry, with fishing vessels and gear appropriate to the allowable level of exploitation of aquatic resources; ensuring that safe production and high economic efficiency contribute to improving the lives of fishermen; and ensuring national defence and security and maintaining the country's independence and sovereignty over seas and islands. He stated the Government of Vietnam issued many domestic guidelines and policies to realize these goals and has ratified and participated in various international agreements, for example:  the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA), and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Port State Measures Agreement. He noted that Vietnam has been a WCPFC CNM from 2009 to the present, and as such has been working with the WCPFC’s 26 CCMs, 8 CNMs and 7 participating territories to implement WCPFC CMMs relating to migratory fisheries resources in the WCPO. He stated that the WCPFC's projects have created favourable conditions for Vietnam to receive fisheries-related technical support and advanced technology. He stated Vietnam greatly appreciated the opportunity to host WCPFC19, which enabled Vietnam's fishing industry in general and tuna fishing in particular to integrate deeply with the world's fisheries, thereby contributing to strengthening cooperation with other CCMs and CNMs, regional fisheries organizations, and multilateral organizations. The Director General stated that Vietnam would continue to actively participate and seek to contribute even more effectively in the WCPFC, and reiterated Vietnam’s interest in becoming a full member of WCPFC. He stated Vietnam supported the region's joint commitment and efforts to strengthen the traceability of tuna products; conserve and sustainably develop migratory resources; and combat illegal, unreported and unreported fishing, in compliance with regional and international regulations towards responsible fisheries. The Director General wished all delegates productive discussions in Da Nang city and an enjoyable stay in Vietnam. His remarks are included as Attachment B. 9. The Commission Chair, Ms Jung-re Riley Kim welcomed Dr. Tran Dinh Luan, the Director General of the Directorate of Fisheries of Vietnam, as well as the honourable ministers, delegates, representatives and attendees at WCPFC19. She expressed her appreciation to the government of Vietnam for hosting WCPFC19 in Da Nang, and for its warm hospitality. She stated that as Dr. Luan alluded, Vietnam and the WCPFC have maintained longstanding cooperation. She stated that two rounds of tuna data management workshops took place in Vietnam in 2022 with the assistance of SPC-OFP, the Commission’s scientific services provider, and stated she looked forward to even closer cooperation between the WCPFC and Vietnam. She observed that the Commission’s last in-person meeting (WCPFC16) was held in Papua New Guinea, and at that meeting it was not imagined that it would be the last such in-person meeting for several 3    years. She noted that the work of the Commission had not been spared from the impact of the pandemic; mandates and responsibilities could not be delayed, which resulted in the need to work even harder and engage even more closely, albeit virtually in the face of the unprecedented global health crisis. She stated that the Commission successfully carried out important tasks, and made significant progress, and that through this perseverance, the Commission again demonstrated its collective strength as the custodian of the world’s largest tuna fishery. She observed that the Commission had a very full agenda to address at WCPFC19, including a number of scientific presentations under Agenda Item 6, reflecting the importance of scientific information in support of the Commission’s decision-making. She emphasized the importance for WCPFC19 of the adoption of a Management Procedure (MP) for skipjack tuna, and progressing various elements of Harvest Strategies for the key tuna stocks. She also noted the need to move beyond the Commission’s use of a “bridging measure” to manage skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna stocks through implementation of the Harvest Strategy Work Plan (HSWP), while acknowledging that the Commission faced some very important decisions in 2023 to either revise or develop a new tropical tuna measure (TTM) that outlines hard limits for purse seine effort or catch, and longline limits and their allocation. She stated that at WCPFC19 CCMs would have an opportunity to discuss next steps so that the Commission can fulfil its commitment envisaged in CMM 2021-01. She noted the need to address issues related to the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS) on the risk-based assessment framework (RBAF) and compliance audit points, as well as to review the work of various intersessional working groups (IWGs). She stated that the WCPFC boasts one of the most advanced CMSs among regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs), and hoped that WCPFC19 could make further progress to make the system even stronger. She also highlighted the importance of resuming the Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR) review in 2023 so as not to leave any unmanageable gap in compliance monitoring. She also noted the opportunity to make progress in transhipment management discussions. She stated that the Commission would also consider improvement of ecosystem management, including as it relates to sharks and seabirds. She also highlighted the importance of work on labour standards, noting that the lines between the mandates of RFMOs and other organizations are blurring, and it was no longer possible to say it is not the WCPFC’s responsibility to deal with issues that are not directly related to fishery resource management, because fisheries impacts are inextricably linked with issues involving people and environments. She stressed the need to push boundaries to address overarching issues, including labour standards and climate change, noting the latter was likely to impact small island developing states (SIDS) the hardest if left unmanaged. She stated that the time was mature for incorporating climate change considerations into the work of the Commission. She expressed the hope the WCPFC19 outcomes document would contain a number of agreements and achievements that all delegates could be proud of. She closed by voicing her appreciation for the excellent and professional assistance provided by the Secretariat and SPC-OFP, as well as the contributions of the ISC, and the Chairs, Vice Chairs, Convenors and Co-Convenors of the subsidiary bodies and working groups. Her remarks are included as Attachment C."
WCPFC19,10,"The WCPFC Executive Director, Feleti P Teo, OBE welcomed the Director-General of the Directorate of Fisheries of Vietnam and thanked him for sharing Vietnam’s insights on the work of the Commission and for affirming Vietnam’s commitment to remain engaged and active in the work of the Commission. He also acknowledged and welcomed the other dignitaries and delegates attending WCPFC19. He noted that WCPFC19 was unique in that it was the first hybrid meeting of the Commission to include virtual and face-to-face participation, and its first physical meeting since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; and he also remarked on the pleasure of reconnecting in person with delegates and colleagues. He congratulated and commended the Government of Vietnam for successfully hosting the 19th annual meeting of the Commission despite the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, and for becoming the first CNM state to host a Commission meeting, let alone an annual meeting. He observed that this constituted a significant affirmation of Vietnam’s commitment to sustainable conservation and management principles upon which the WCPFC is founded. He recalled the challenges faced by the Commission in adapting and adjusting to a new working environment as dictated by the disruptive impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on international travel and modes of transacting businesses, and expressed his admiration at 4    the high level of resilience, adaptability and perseverance of the Commission’s members, noting that despite the inability to meet physically and the constraints and confinements of virtual meetings, the Commission sustained its routine operations and functions as mandated by the WCPF Convention.  Although, there were slippages in achievement of agreed timelines for some of the more technically challenging issues like those associated with implementation of the HSWP, the Commission continued to undertake its scheduled stock assessments; sustained and continued operations of its compliance and monitoring control and surveillance tools and programmes; sustained and improved the operations of the WCPFC Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS); negotiated a revised Tropical Tuna Measure (TTM); and convened on a trial basis the first virtual Science-Management Dialogue (SMD). He stated that attaining these achievements despite the challenging operational circumstances attested to the unique character of the WCPFC which is the Commission’s ability to rise to the occasion and do right for the sustainability of the health of the fish stocks under the purview of the Commission. He stated he was looking forward to that unique character to guide the Commission in Da Nang as it addressed key issues of harvest strategy development and implementation including a Management Procedure for skipjack; ongoing reforms to improve the efficiency and efficacy of the CMS; preparations for negotiations of a new or revised TTM in 2023; and progressing the important work of the various IWGs on issues such as electronic reporting and monitoring (ER and EM), crew labour standards, and the transhipment review. The Executive Director stated that his Annual Report for 2022 documents a full and active year for the Commission and the Secretariat, which included virtual meetings of all its subsidiary bodies, a number of intersessional working groups, a special session to consider the intersessional decisions to suspend certain observer placement requirements, and the first SMD. He observed that the outcomes of all these meetings would be considered by the Commission in Da Nang, and would form the basis for the WCPFC19 decisions. The Executive Director stated that as he anticipated his departure from WCPFC in early 2023 he did so with fond memories and a sense of self-satisfaction. He noted that in Apia, Samoa at WCPFC11 in December 2014 he was entrusted with the responsibility of leading the WCPFC Secretariat, which he stated he undertook with all seriousness, dignity and humility. He stated his gratitude of having been a very small part of the WCPFC’s journey over the past eight years, and noted the WCPFC’s many successes and achievements, unmatched by its counterpart tuna-RFMOs. He noted with thanks and appreciation the contributions of those who had collaborated closely with the Secretariat in the planning and preparations of the material and documentation for WCPFC19, including the staff of SPC-OFP; the CCMs, CNMs, and observers who contributed papers for the meeting; his tireless colleagues at the WCPFC Secretariat, including the Legal Adviser Dr Penny Riding; and the Commission Chair, Ms Jung-re Riley Kim, noting it had been a joy and pleasure to be led and guided by her. He closed by wishing the Commission very well in its deliberations and stated that the Secretariat stood ready to support the Commission’s deliberations. The Executive Director’s opening statement is included as Attachment D. 1.1 Adoption of Agenda"
WCPFC19,11,The Provisional Agenda was initially issued on 5 October 2022. A revised agenda in WCPFC19-2022-01 rev1 was issued on 29 October 2022.
WCPFC19,12,The Agenda was adopted (Attachment E).
WCPFC19,13,A delegate from Niue offered the opening prayer. 1.2 Statements from Members and Participating Territories
WCPFC19,14,"American Samoa greeted the Chair, delegates and members. It stated that the previous day many of the parties at WCPFC19 had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (the South Pacific Tuna Treaty) with the USA regarding fishing access terms for 2023, and congratulated all parties for this accomplishment; it 5    noted that the treaty, an ongoing agreement between the USA and 16 Pacific Island countries is just as important to American Samoa as it is to other parties. The treaty allows U.S. flagged purse seine vessels to fish in the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of the Pacific Island countries that are parties to the treaty.  All U.S. flagged tuna purse seiners that are based in Pago Pago and that supply tuna to canneries in American Samoa depend on the treaty for access to the fishing grounds managed by the Commission. American Samoa stated that the treaty first entered into force in 1988 when the fishery was very different; at that time the U.S. flagged purse seine fleet was the second-largest operating in what is now the WCPFC Convention Area. The fleet operated predominantly in and out of American Samoa feeding the raw material needs of American Samoa’s canneries. For some time, the U.S. flagged purse seine fleet grew in numbers as some operators choose the U.S. flag to take advantage of the favourable terms of access afforded to them by the Tuna Treaty. Over time, that changed and in recent years the number of U.S. flagged purse seiners serving the needs of American Samoa’s tuna dependent economy continues to decline, and has reached a critically low level. Boats have left the U.S. flag to take advantage of better terms of access, such as the exemptions from the FAD closure and limits on the high seas for vessels that are either flagged or chartered to SIDS. American Samoa stated that these same considerations are not afforded to the American Samoa-based fleet on which American Samoa’s economy urgently depends, even though the Convention itself makes clear that Participating Territories are to be considered in the same light as other SIDS. It stated that if the Commission continues to fail to address this, the trend will continue, and American Samoa will lose its tuna supply. American Samoa stated that it is a small island developing territory and highly dependent on its tuna fishery, which is managed by the Commission, noting that Article 30 of the Convention clearly states that “… the Commission shall take into account the special requirements of developing States Parties, in particular small island developing States, and of territories and possessions.” American Samoa asked CCMs to recognize that this is the most critical issue for its economic survival and stated the hope that CCMs would follow the guidelines provided in the Convention."
WCPFC19,15,"Australia thanked Vietnam for its hospitality and expressed gratitude to all members for their efforts to progress issues during the Covid-19 pandemic. Australia also thanked the Secretariat for its thorough preparations for the meeting, and stated it is pleased that all four major commercial tuna stocks remain above sustainable limits, and the Commission should seek to continue to manage the region’s shared fish stocks in line with best practice to ensure they remain sustainable well into the future. Australia stated it remains strongly committed to the ongoing development and implementation of harvest strategies by WCPFC, noting that their adoption is essential to achieve long-term security of migratory tuna stocks. To this end, Australia strongly encouraged CCMs to support the FFA’s proposal on a management procedure for skipjack tuna, noting that this is a very important step forward for the Commission. Australia stated it was very pleased to bring forward on behalf of FFA members a proposal for a new CMM for Southwest Pacific swordfish. Australia has noted its concerns regarding management of this important stock to WCPFC, and stated that the proposed measure would constitute an important step in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the stock, while protecting future opportunities for fisheries development for SIDS. Australia welcomed the progress made in 2022 to improve the CMS, and observed the critical importance of ensuring the Commission has an effective, robust and fair compliance scheme. Australia also looked forward to working with CCMs on the CMS at WCPC19 and in the months leading up to TCC19. Australia expressed its sincere thanks to the Commission Chair for her leadership, counsel and kindness over the past four years, and to the outgoing Executive Director for his professionalism and leadership. Australia closed by stating it was committed to making significant progress at WCFC19 and looked forward to a successful meeting."
WCPFC19,16,"China stated that it was sorry it could not send a delegation in person, due to China’s COVID-19 prevention policy, but was very happy to see everyone online. China stated that its participation, cooperation and collaboration would not be limited by the need to participate virtually, and stated his hope that it would be possible to produce fruitful results for sustainable management.  6"
WCPFC19,17,"The Honourable Heremoana Maamaatuaiahutapu, Minister of Culture, Environment and Marine Resources of French Polynesia submitted his opening statement, in which he thanked the Executive Director, the Chair, and Secretariat staff, for their efforts, and thanked Vietnam for hosting WCPFC19. He observed that French Polynesia promotes an alternative to the development model based on economic growth alone, noting its objectives include improving quality of life, re-appropriating traditional concepts and knowhow, and creating solidarity among generations and peoples. He stated that the oceans can help address the crucial challenges humanity faces, noting that EEZs are food reservoirs, via fishing and aquaculture, but are also full of promise for health and medical research. He stated that French Polynesia had not issued fishing licenses to foreign vessels since 1996, and the fishing sector is exclusively Polynesian. French Polynesia obtained certification issued by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) for its albacore and yellowfin tuna fisheries in 2018, and for swordfish in 2021. The MSC certification guarantees that fishery products come from sustainable and well-managed supply chains. The Minister stated it is important that certain CMMs can be strengthened and harmonized with IATTC, and that work on management strategies be completed, and on time. In 2019 French Polynesia accounted for just 0.24% of the Pacific-wide catch of the four main tuna species (skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye, southern albacore), equal to 7,189 metric tons out of a total of 2,997,309 metric tons. He stated that French Polynesia has 212 marine species and 51 marine areas protected by the Polynesian environmental code; 40 regulated fishing areas and 30 “educational marine areas”. In 2002, French Polynesia became the largest marine mammal sanctuary in the world, which now also protects all shark species, sea turtle species and all mobula rays species. In 2018, French Polynesia created Tainui atea, an ocean space of 5 million km² protected by its environmental code. Tainui ātea is the heir to more than 70 years of protective measures put in place by successive Polynesian governments and which protects all Polynesian birds, organized traditional and professional fishing, and prohibits access to certain areas of the territory to preserve nature. He emphasised the importance of addressing the massive arrival of drifting FADs in many EEZs, stating that the drifting FADs found along the coasts of French Polynesia’s islands and atolls are deployed in large part by purse seine fisheries in the Eastern Pacific, and they constitute a source of pollution that should be denounced and stopped. He stated that it is important for French Polynesia’s islands, already subject to the effects of climate change, that efforts are continued, awareness raised, and that leaders understand the urgent need to limit the use of FADs and the resulting impact on the reefs, ecosystems, and fisheries. He stated that it is necessary that purse seiners become responsible for the damage they cause. He stated that Government of French Polynesia seeks to prevent FADs from drifting into its EEZ, and to prevent them from stranding on French Polynesia’s shores. He asked CCMs consider the importance of harmonizing management measures between the EPO and WCPO, which he stated was important to in order to guarantee the application and effectiveness of CMMs."
WCPFC19,18,"Indonesia thanked the Chair, the Secretariat, and the Government of Vietnam for their excellent work in facilitating WCPFC19, and expressed condolences and solidarity for those facing hardship and loss related to COVID-"
WCPFC19,19,"It stated that to comply with the TTMs applied in the WCPFC Convention Area, Indonesia developed an Interim Harvest Strategy Framework for tropical tuna in Indonesian Archipelagic Waters beginning in 2014. The interim framework was launched in 2018 with yearly updates provided to WCPFC meetings to inform the Commission and its subsidiary bodies regarding the harvest strategy progress. Indonesia stated that it is a challenging process, and Indonesia received much input and support from fishery stakeholders and experts in progressing the development and implementation of the framework. Indonesia noted that it is willing to collaborate with neighbouring countries to ensure the region’s sustainability of tropical tuna stocks. It noted that in CMM 2014-06 the Commission agreed to develop and implement a harvest strategy approach for each of the key fisheries or stocks under its purview. The Commission also agreed on a work plan and indicative timeframes to adopt or refine harvest strategies for skipjack, bigeye, yellowfin, South Pacific albacore, pacific bluefin, and northern albacore tuna. However, some of the expected progress has yet to be achieved following the proposed timelines. Therefore, Indonesia proposed to revisit the timelines adopted in the CMM 2014-06 and encouraged other CCMs to expedite the development of harvest strategy in the WCPO, and maintain their awareness of the status of tuna stocks in their subregion. Indonesia also stated it sought to review progress on the intersessional discussion on the 7    proposed CMM on Labour Standards, Safety and Security for Crew on Fishing Vessels; it noted discussions had been held over the prior two years, virtually co-chaired by Indonesia and New Zealand. Although discussions remain in progress, Indonesia stressed the importance of finalizing and adopting the proposal to avoid and mitigate the risks of further abuse of crew members being perpetrated by captains and vessel owners that fly their flag in the Commission and operate in the WCPFC Convention Area. Indonesia also sought to inform delegates on progress relating to Indonesia’s handline fishery, which has two main components, one that targets large yellowfin tuna and the other that generally catches small tuna (yellowfin, bigeye, and skipjack tuna). Indonesia’s small-scale hook-and-line fisheries are restricted to territorial seas and archipelagic waters. However, a certain component of the catch of the Indonesia “large-fish” handline fishery taken from Indonesia’s EEZ may be relevant to the TTMs. An information document (WCPFC19-2022-DP11) relevant to the Handline Fishery was provided collaboratively by Indonesia and SPC. Indonesia also drew attention to the provision enshrined in Article 4 of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the WCPO, which states that nothing in the Convention shall prejudice the rights, jurisdiction, and duties of States under UNCLOS and the UNFSA, and that elaborates that the Convention shall be interpreted and applied in the context of and in a manner consistent with the UNCLOS and the UNFSA. It closed expressing the hope that the critical issues to be deliberated at WCPFC19 would provide beneficial results that contribute significantly to meeting the WCPFC’s objectives, and stated Indonesia would work constructively and cooperatively with other CCMs to that end.  19. Kiribati read out a statement on behalf of the Kiribati Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources Development, and Chair of the Forum Fisheries Agency Forum Fisheries Committee (FFC) the Honourable Ribanataake Tiwau who was unable to attend the meeting. The statement expressed the pleasure to meet everyone again in person, and sincere gratitude to the host, the Government and people of Vietnam, for the warm hospitality extended to the Commission.  On behalf of FFA members, he thanked the Chair, and all CCMs, for their virtual work together over the prior 3 years, stating that despite the challenges, the Commission had managed to continue to transact significant work, including working towards the revised CMM for Tropical Tuna and the CMS. He stated that this was a testament to members’ shared commitment to ensuring the long-term sustainability of our tuna resources. He stated that FFA members had continuously highlighted how significant these resources are to the Pacific people, and that the importance had only increased with the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Pacific economies, as the Pacific’s tuna resources underpin both economic recovery and food security. At the same time, the impacts of climate change are being directly felt and cannot be considered a “future threat”.  He stated that it is in this context that FFA members continue to pursue their development aspirations and reiterate their special requirements in accordance with Article 30 of the Convention, CMM 2013-07, and CMM 2013-06. He stated that FFA members submitted a number of priorities for the meeting as outlined in WCPFC19-2022-DP03, including the CMM proposals for an MP for skipjack tuna in WCPFC19-2022-DP04, electronic reporting in WCPFC19-2022-DP05, Harvest Strategies in WCPFC19-2022-DP06 and swordfish in WCPFC19-2022-DP07. He stated that FFA members sought the same spirit of cooperation that has seen the Commission through its challenges for the work at WCPFC19. He recognised the hard work and leadership of the WCPFC Chair for ably steering the Commission through its virtual meetings, and expressed his appreciation to the Executive Director and his team for the excellent preparation for this meeting.  He closed by stating he was very much looked forward to the upcoming discussions."
WCPFC19,20,"The Honourable John M. Silk, Minister of the Republic of the Marshall Islands Ministry of Natural Resources and Commerce (NRC), and Chairman of the Marshall Islands Marine Resources Authority (MIMRA) Board of Directors acknowledged the Honourable Ministers and other distinguished representatives, delegates, and attendees at WCPFC, and stated it was a pleasure to meet in person. He also conveyed his delegation's gratitude to the Government and People of Vietnam. He acknowledged the very good work and guidance of the WCPFC Chair, noting that her leadership and management of the issues and the wide-ranging views and positions of CCMs, CNMs and observers had been very fair, firm and productive, and also thanked the Government of Korea. The Minister also thanked the WCPFC Executive 8    Director for his many years of able stewardship and sound leadership of the WCPFC Secretariat. He drew attention to the key priority issues for RMI: the proposals in WCPFC19-2022-DP04 (CMM on an MP for WCPO skipjack tuna) and WCPFC19-2022-DP06 (proposed amendment to CMM 2014-06 on establishing a Harvest Strategy for key fisheries and stocks in the WCPO), which were tabled by FFA members. He emphasized the importance of the proposals for all CCMs and CNMs, and stated his confidence that the outcome would reflect everyone’s collective and effective participation, noting that the alternative was grim, and did not bode well for future management and development goals.  He suggested that the fundamental questions to ask are namely: where do we see our fishery in 5 or 10 years?;  what must we do now to ensure the many interconnected issues that we see as crucial towards ensuring our livelihoods and resilience and those of generations to come are secured well into the future?; and how can we be efficient in moving these many interconnected issues into decisions that can be acceptable to all? He stated that he posed these questions in the hope that when participants leave Vietnam, they will have taken a collective decision that ensures stocks are well managed and managed for the sake of the future. He noted that other important items on the agenda such as the labour standards and the CMS measure should be considered through the same questions. He closed by stating he looked forward to progressing the meeting and stood ready to participate effectively and constructively as necessary for successful outcomes from WCPFC19."
WCPFC19,21,"New Caledonia congratulated the WCPFC Secretariat team and particularly the Executive Director for the work done to during the pandemic, stating it was pleased to be meeting in Da Nang, and expressed warm thanks to Vietnam’s authorities. It stated that COVID-19 has had major impacts on WCPFC tuna fisheries: observer coverage has fallen, historical longline fisheries targeting yellowfin have switched temporarily to albacore, the tuna market has been impacted, while the cost of fuel, fishing gear and freight have increased dramatically, everything has increased except tuna prices. New Caledonia’s longline fishery has been highly impacted. Although small, it provides fresh protein from the sea to New Caledonia’s population. New Caledonia stated the hope than the meeting would allow progress to be made on important topics, particularly on the management of South Pacific albacore, which is crucial for Pacific Island countries and territories, including New Caledonia."
WCPFC19,22,"The Honourable Esa-Sharon Mona Ainu'u, Minister of Natural Resources, Government of Niue offered Niue’s appreciation and thanks to Vietnam for their warm hospitality, and gratitude to the Chair for her hard work, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. She stated that her presence in Da Nang was an illustration of the ongoing commitment of Niue to the WCPFC mission, stating that it was in honour of her people’s ancestors and future generations to ensure fishery resources in the WCPO are sustainable. She spoke of WCPFC’s collective responsibility to ensure that tuna resources are productive and sustainable, and stated that in support of this Niue had worked closely with other South Pacific CCMs to strengthen their cooperation and develop their common vision and collective capacity. She stated that the common purpose of the South Pacific Group would be become an important foundation for cooperation, and welcomed it establishment. She stated that cooperation at subregional, regional and RFMO levels was critical to Niue’s future. She stated that CCMs would have their own expectations and desired outcomes regarding the agenda before WCPFC19, and that Niue looked forward to decisions on the FFA’s priorities, with two particular concerns: as a South Pacific coastal state that is dependent on fisheries for food security, livelihoods, and revenue, there is a critical need to progress management of South Pacific albacore, and to rebuild the fishery’s profitability, and stated she looked forward to developing management objectives and a target reference point (TRP) for South Pacific albacore in 20"
WCPFC19,23,"She also spoke of the need to develop a process and workplan to establish limits and allocations for high seas purse seine fisheries that specifically recognizes the rights of SIDS and allows them to develop fisheries in the high seas. She stated that all could all share and successfully manage the WCPFC’s vital fishery if all CCMs cooperated and negotiated in good faith. 23. The Honourable Steven Victor, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Environment in Palau submitted his opening statement in which he thanked the people and the Socialist Government of Vietnam 9    for hosting WCPFC19 and for working with the Secretariat in making the excellent meeting arrangements.  He acknowledged the Executive Director and congratulated him on his tenure. He stated he looked forward to working with his successor and assured the incoming Commission Executive Director of Palau’s continued support. He noted that members share deep concerns for the health of the ocean, and stated that Palau acknowledges the important role of a healthy ocean in supporting biodiversity that supports sustainable livelihoods and economic opportunities, and resilient food security. Palau supports the global goal of 30 x 30 for nature and people, and has demonstrated its support for such this global initiative through by implementing the Palau National Marine Sanctuary, banning deep sea mining, banning bottom trawling, and implementing a shark sanctuary. He stated that Palau has long understood the ocean-climate-nexus and the role that a healthy ocean plays in mitigating the impacts of climate change. He expressed Palau’s deep concern regarding the projected impact of climate change on its fisheries that will impact livelihoods, the economy and food security. Palau acknowledged and welcomed the proposal from the United States to further embed the discussion of climate change in the agendas of the Northern Committee (NC) and TCC, and stated this was an important opportunity to support the work of the WCPFC to improve our understanding of the impacts of climate on our fisheries and particularly, the management intervention and innovation in fisheries development that can help support future economic loss and loss of food security.  Palau underscores the urgency of limiting global warming to within 1.5° Celsius by the end of this century to ensure that impacts to people, fisheries, and ocean biodiversity does not continue to inflict harm and burden on the most vulnerable communities. He stated Palau supports the proposal put forward by FFA members in WCPFC19-2022-DP04, which is an important step in toward full adoption of the harvest strategy approach by the WCPFC. He stated Palau believes that sufficient data on fishing activities within the WCPO will better inform policies and strategies to effectively control and monitor our tuna stocks, and indicated the Commission should take advantage of technical advances in fisheries management and monitoring; by adopting the proposed amendment to CMM 2013-05 on Daily Catch and Effort Reporting, the Commission can improve the quality of data for conducting stock assessments. He stated that Palau is one of the smallest members of the Commission and continues to struggle with the ever-increasing level of reporting required by the Commission in the implementation of the management obligations. As proposals are considered at WCPFC19, he stated Palau wished to raise the issue of the challenges faced by small administrations in dealing with additional reporting associated with management obligations, and encouraged members to seek efficient methods that can be automated to alleviate some of the reporting burden. He suggested this might be achieved through the use of electronic reporting as a minimum requirement, which could do much to streamlining electronic systems and the reporting burden for small administrations. The Minister stated that many CCMs would have heard him observe that “Tuna is the key to unlocking many opportunities of our small island states and our developing economies.” He urged CCMs to keep this in mind while WCPFC conducted its careful discussions on how to maintain and ensure sustainable management of the region’s healthy tuna stocks and healthy ocean while also assuring equitable benefit to the region’s people. He closed by stating he looked forward to a productive meeting at WCPFC19."
WCPFC19,24,"Papua New Guinea congratulated the Government and the People of Vietnam for hosting WCPFC19, and stated PNG would focus on important issues at hand in emphasizing the importance of reaching consensus for the sustainability of key tuna stocks and other species within the WCPO. It stated that the resource is close to the hearts of PNG’s people, and sought to ensure future generations also benefit from the resources CCMs currently enjoy. PNG stressed the need for the Commission to be mindful of the obligations under CMM 2013-07 during its deliberations, noting the need to give full recognition to the special requirements of developing states, in particular SIDS and Territories, in relation to the conservation and management of highly migratory fish stocks in the WCPFC Convention Area and the development of their own fisheries for such stocks. PNG also stated the need to for the Commission to ensure a disproportionate burden of conservation action is not placed on SIDS and territories. PNG stated it considers the Harvest Strategy work for skipjack and the other tuna stocks to be a priority task, and stated the hope that WCPFC19 would have successful discussions and a good outcome on the Harvest Strategy for skipjack and the other tuna stocks. While noting more discussion would be required to progress work on the Harvest 10    Strategy for bigeye and yellowfin tuna, with further discussions among CCMs on the management objective and revised TRP for South Pacific albacore, PNG stated it was particularly eager to see the MP and a TRP for skipjack adopted at WCPFC19.  PNG stated that this is of critical importance, especially as PNG is pursuing a new fisheries strategic plan aimed at optimizing its benefits from the sustainable management and development of its tuna fishery. It encouraged the Commission not to be selfish in its discussions but to act in the best interest of member states, particularly SIDS and territories, taking into consideration the livelihoods and development aspirations that hinge on the decision made at WCPFC19. PNG noted with deep concern that SIDS faced the possible loss of millions of dollars and many jobs in the fisheries sector depending on the decisions made at WCPFC19 in regard to the adoption of a TRP and MP for skipjack, and discussions surrounding Harvest Strategy work on other tuna species. Regarding the CMS, while acknowledging the value of the scheme in improving compliance in the purse seine fishery, PNG stated it sees an imbalance in the CMS in terms of its monitoring of the different fisheries. The 100% observer coverage obligation and better reporting in the purse seine fishery places a spotlight on the fishery in terms of alleged infringements. This is a concern to PNG as it continues to invest significantly in domestic comprehensive management and MCS tools and regimes. PNG called on the Commission to cooperate and work together to prevent any form of bias or unfairness that the implementation of the CMS scheme may impose on members. It observed that the WCPFC is well known for its efforts to maintain a balance between conservation and sustainable development of Pacific stocks. PNG urged CCMs to seriously think about future generations and their right to enjoy the benefits of WCPO tuna stocks."
WCPFC19,25,"The Honourable Maiava Fuimaono Tito Asafo, Associate Minister of Agriculture & Fisheries of the Independent State of Samoa, expressed on behalf of the Government of Samoa his appreciation to the host Government and people of Vietnam. He thanked the WCPFC Executive Director and his hard-working team for organizing the WCPFC annual meeting. He stated that at their 51st meeting in 2022 Pacific Island Forum Leaders endorsed the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. The 2050 Strategy was deliberately designed as the overarching policy to strengthen collective action and deepen regionalism for the next three decades. At its heart is the centrality of ocean and our natural resources to our people, economies, social development, culture and livelihoods. He stated that is critical that we keep this at the forefront of our minds, and that for Samoa, a vibrant and sustainable fisheries sector continues to underpin national efforts to fully realize the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular SDG 14 ‘to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development’ as well successful implementation of Samoa’s national development plan. He stated that Samoa had come to WCPFC19 with a renewed sense of dedication and commitment to work closely with the WCPFC Secretariat and Samoa’s development partners to bring about positive and effective progress in the sustainable management and conservation of its fisheries resources. He highlighted several key areas of critical importance to Samoa and other SIDS. They include firstly, the MP for South Pacific albacore. He noted that albacore is extremely important to Samoa, noting there has been a general decline in catch rates and vulnerable levels of spawning biomass for this stock over the years. He noted with great concern that the South Pacific albacore stock was projected to continuously decline under current conditions since 2015 and had a 17% chance of falling below the limit reference point (LRP) by 2018, and stated this must not be allowed to continue. He stated that the Commission is obligated to implement management measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of this resource. He thanked the Scientific Services Provider (SPC-OFP) for their hard work on this issue, and noted that the effective management of the southern longline fishery is of high importance to all CCMs targeting South Pacific albacore, and that Samoa is supportive and committed to the works to improve the management of this key fishery through the harvest strategy approach and implementation of zone-based management. He urged Commission members, particularly fishing partners interested in South Pacific albacore, to urgently develop an agreed, robust management arrangement, for that species, including progressing agreement on various elements of a harvest strategy, such as revising the interim TRP. Secondly, the CMS in which he noted relevant recommendations put forth and highlighted by TCC18 and referenced in WCPFC-2022-"
WCPFC19,26,"And thirdly, the WCPO Shark Stocks and By-Catch Mitigation matter in which he stated that this is a priority issue for Samoa. Samoa supported the recommendations put forward by SC18 and TCC18 and stated support 11    for the proposal from the USA and Canada on the review of the Sharks CMM 2019-04. He closed by reminding CCMs why that they were all present because they agreed to collaboratively work towards a common goal of ensuring that through consensus, they would agree to measures that will ensure the sustainable use of migratory tuna stocks and other species within the WCPO. 26. Tuvalu presented a statement on behalf of the Honourable Kitiona Tausi, Minister of Fisheries and Trade, Government of Tuvalu who was delayed arriving in Da Nang. The Minister thanked the Government and people of Vietnam for their hospitality, congratulated the Chair for her achievements as Chair, and congratulated the Executive Director for his work at the Secretariat, and looked forward to welcoming him back home in Tuvalu. As the current chair of the PNA, the Minister joined other FFA and PNA members in urging WCPFC19 to approve their proposal and approve an interim MP for skipjack. He noted that the Commission was behind schedule in implementing harvest strategies, and stated that the proposal constituted a genuine and carefully considered effort to get things back on track. He noted that implementation of the proposal would signal a commitment to implementing harvest strategies for skipjack and other target tuna species, and that this was particularly important for securing valuable MSC certifications of WCPO fisheries. He also noted important proposals to improve management of longline fisheries, noting the proposal by the USA and Canada relating to banning of wire traces to reduce shark bycatch, and the proposal to require electronic reporting by longline vessels. He noted the requirements in place in Tuvalu’s EEZ, and stated that Tuvalu was getting tired of strengthening the management of longline fisheries in its EEZ while vessels move into the high seas to take advantage of the lack of control in those waters. He stated that management of fisheries in the high seas is the job of the WCPFC, and its reason for its existence. He noted the deployment of observers, stating that Tuvalu had relaxed COVID-19 restrictions, and that its Observer Programme was open for business.   1.3 Meeting Arrangements"
WCPFC19,27,"The Commission reviewed the meeting arrangements and indicative meeting schedule, and confirmed decisions made at the Heads of Delegation meeting, held on 27 November. The meeting schedule was agreed as outlined in WCPFC19-2022-01B which would be update on a daily basis. 1.3.1 Hybrid meeting protocols"
WCPFC19,28,"The Executive Director explained the key online meeting protocols as outlined in WCPFC19-2022-02. He noted that all registered virtual participants would be able to see and hear all sessions, but only virtual participants from countries that have no Head of Delegation in Da Nang would be able to intervene virtually. 1.3.2  Establishment of small working groups (CNMs, CMR, others)"
WCPFC19,29,"The Commission agreed to establish eight small working groups (SWGs) as follows: i) CNM (led by Australia)  ii) CMS Audit Points (led by RMI)  iii) Labour standards (led by New Zealand and Indonesia)  iv) South Pacific albacore (led by Fiji) v) Transhipment (led by USA and Vanuatu)  vi) Skipjack management procedures in WCPFC19-2022-DP04 (led by RMI) vii) Southwest Pacific swordfish proposal in WCPFC19-2022-DP07 (led by Australia, to be confirmed) viii) Electronic reporting (ER) proposal in WCPFC19-2022-DP05 (led by New Zealand)  12    AGENDA ITEM 2   — ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR"
WCPFC19,30,"The Executive Director’s Annual Report (WCPFC19-2022-04), which is a requirement under Rule 13 of the Commission’s Rules of Procedure, was issued on 14 October 2022, and was taken as read. The paper was posted on the WCPFC19 Online Discussion Forum (as Topic A), and no comments were received."
WCPFC19,31,"Tuvalu, on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau, extended warm appreciation to the Executive Director for his stewardship of the organization over the past eight years, noting this was an unprecedented time in the short history of the WCPFC. Tuvalu drew attention to paragraph 57 of the report, and stated that while they welcomed the return of physical meetings, they also acknowledged that there was much work to catch up on and stated the need for a process to prioritize and schedule the work to be progressed. They stated that the priorities for the PNA and Tokelau for 2023 would be the negotiations of the tropic tuna measure, the intersessional work to improve longline MCS measures through transhipment monitoring, and the reshaping of the Compliance Monitoring Scheme."
WCPFC19,32,"The Commission noted with appreciation the 2022 Annual Report of the Executive Director (WCPFC19-2022-04) and recognized the valuable service of the Executive Director, Feleti Penitala Teo OBE, during his tenure as Executive Director.   AGENDA ITEM 3  —  MEMBERSHIP AND OTHER APPLICATIONS 3.1 Status of the Convention"
WCPFC19,33,New Zealand’s report as the Depositary on the status of the WCPF Convention (WCPFC19-2022-05 Status of the Convention) was taken as read.
WCPFC19,34,The Commission noted with appreciation the report on the Status of the WCPFC Convention (WCPFC19-2022-05).  3.2 Update on Observer Status
WCPFC19,35,The Chair noted with appreciation the contributions of the accredited observers to the work of the Commission. The Secretariat’s updated report on observer status (WCPFC19-2022-06 List of Observers) was taken as read; it notes that no state or NGO observers were removed in 2022 under the requirements of Rule 36 of the Rules of Procedure.
WCPFC19,36,The Commission noted the updated list of observers to the Commission (WCPFC19-2022-06 Rev 1).   3.3 Applications for Cooperating Non-Member (CNM) status
WCPFC19,37,"The Commission considered applications for CNM status for 2023 in accordance with CMM 2019-01, including recommendations from TCC18. As outlined in WCPFC19-2022-07: Cooperating Non-Member Requests for 2023, there were eight applications for CNM status received in 2022 (from Curacao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam). All applicants are current CNMs in 2022. TCC18 considered the 8 applications and agreed to forward all applications to WCPFC19. The 13    TCC18 decisions and recommendations to WCPFC18 are in paragraph 8 of WCPFC19-2022-07. The Secretariat noted that all CNM contributions for 2021 and 2022 had been paid, as indicated in Table 2 of the paper."
WCPFC19,38,"Tuvalu on behalf of FFA members stated that in light of the recommendations from TCC18, FFA members supported CNM renewal for Curacao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Thailand and Vietnam. They stated that for Nicaragua CNM status may be conferred for 2023, but that participatory rights for 2023 should be considered separately under Agenda Item 3.3.1, and clearly specified based on the limits contained in WCPFC CMMs. They stated that for Panama, TCC18 identified a number of issues that needed to be addressed, particularly in relation to non-compliance with WCPFC CMMs. FFA members requested that these issues be considered by the CNM SWG in the first instance, noting in particular the limits prescribed in paragraph 42 of CMM 2021-01."
WCPFC19,39,"The EU stated that TCC18 had expressed concerns regarding renewal of Panama’s CNM status, and that Panama was requested to provide additional information and confirm to the satisfaction of CCMs that the serious incidents involving Panama flagged vessels that had arisen elsewhere would not take place in the WCPFC Convention Area. The EU stated that as CCMs had not been able to review this information it would be difficult to make a decision, and encouraged Panama to make the requested information available as soon as possible. Japan also encouraged Panama to make the requested information available."
WCPFC19,40,"The WCPFC Compliance Manger stated that Panama had not submitted additional information following the TCC18 meeting, and confirmed that information from Nicaragua had been posted to the Secretariat’s CNM webpage for consideration by CCMs. Nicaragua stated it sought to ensure that its vessels comply with the WCPFC CMMs, and requested that the Commission indicate what additional information it required. In response the Chair stated that Nicaragua had provided some information, which would be considered by the SWG."
WCPFC19,41,Panama expressed its appreciation to the Executive Director for his work on behalf of the Commission.
WCPFC19,42,"The Commission noted and accepted the applications for CNM status in 2022 from Curacao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam. A SWG was established, chaired by Australia. The Chair noted that in accordance with the WCPFC’s established practice, the SWG would provide advice to the Commission on the participatory rights of CNMs. The Commission agreed that applicants could attend the SWG to provide clarifications and answers to questions that might be posed. Following its deliberations, the SWG would provide advice to the Commission on the participatory rights of CNMs (under Agenda Item 3.3.1)."
WCPFC19,43," The EU stated that it welcomed political expressions of commitment towards a more effective fight against IUU fishing activities in high level conferences, or as recently during the FAO Committee on Fisheries (COFI) plenary meeting in Rome in September 2022. The EU referenced a situation that it stated involved testing of actual willingness to fight IUU fishing. The EU stated that it was concerned to note that although Panama reported that the vessel that triggered the concern of TCC18 was being monitored, the EU’s investigation suggested that the vessel was actually at sea. It stated it had no indication that Panama detected this situation before the EU’s bilateral exchange with Panama, and noted that the letter reporting this situation to the NPFC Secretariat was sent after the bilateral exchange between the EU and Panama. The EU stated that it was both worrying and disappointing that Panama did not ensure proper reporting to WCPFC, especially when taking into consideration the level of attention that could be expected on this vessel. The EU confirmed, in that respect, its substantial reservations regarding Panama’s ability to monitor the activities of its fleet. In the spirit of cooperation but reluctantly, the EU stated it would not block the agreement to grant Panama CNM status. However, it highlighted that all actions would be taken into account 14    next year as the CNM SWG proposed. In that respect, the EU specifically encouraged Panama to ensure the settlement of the sanctions imposed before any removal of the vessel from the registry, in line with Paragraph 24 of the FAO Guidelines for Flag State Performance. Moreover, the EU noted that other WCPFC CCMs had and have a relevant role to play. The EU stated with deep regret that China, as port State, seemed to have been unable to effectively act against an IUU third-country flagged vessel in its port despite a prohibition for sailing and a request of support by the flag State. The EU also called on Chinese Taipei, which is a member of WCPFC and NPFC, to actively monitor the vessel as the last known position (dated 23 November) would be only 10 nautical miles from Kaohsiung port."
WCPFC19,44,"Chinese Taipei stated that as a responsible member of both WCPFC and NPFC it had already taken actions to monitor the vessels. It noted that its policy was to not allow vessels on an IUU list to use its ports. It stated that because the vessels were located near Chinese Taipei’s waters, it would continue to monitor their activities and share that information with relevant CCMs."
WCPFC19,45,"China referenced the EU’s statement that mentioned that China should play its due role as a port state. China stated that it believes that the mention of China in this statement has nothing to do with this item and is not constructive, and that it was incomprehensible and unacceptable for the EU statement to mention China. China stated that the WCPFC should not waste time talking about the issues of other organizations. China stated it attaches great importance to and has taken active measures on combating IUU fishing activities in close cooperation with the international community. It noted that the Chinese fisheries authority actively carried out domestic coordination among agencies and had been in close communication with Panama regarding this particular vessel. In accordance with Panama’s requirements, the port authority was urged to postpone approval of the vessel's entry into port and make preparations for port inspection. The carrier then left the outer anchorage of the port on its own. Later, China approved the entry and inspection of another Panamanian carrier that applied to call at a Chinese port. China stated it would continue to maintain communication regarding the two carriers with Panama and the EU through bilateral channels and continue to work closely with all parties to jointly combat IUU fishing activities."
WCPFC19,46,"The Commission approved the applications for CNM status for 2023 from Curaçao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Thailand and Vietnam."
WCPFC19,47,"WCPFC19 noted the significant concerns expressed by TCC18 regarding recent serious incidents involving Panama’s flagged vessels in the NPFC Convention area. The Commission noted that Panama provided further information to the Commission requested by TCC18, including evidence of Panama’s submission of relevant information to NPFC to include the flagged vessel on the NPFC IUU vessel list."
WCPFC19,48,"WCPFC19 reiterated TCC18’s reminder to encourage Panama to make efforts to make improvements to the management of its vessels. WCPFC tasks TCC19 to consider the outcome of NPFC IUU listing process and further efforts on Panama’s improvements to manage and monitor its vessels when considering Panama’s CNM application in 2023. The Commission noted the NPFC IUU listing process was ongoing and as such, recommends the approval of the renewal of Panama's CNM status for 2023.  3.3.1 Participatory rights of CNMs"
WCPFC19,49,"The Commission reviewed the limits of participatory rights of CNMs under various CMMs in accordance with paragraphs 12 and 13 of CMM 2019-01.  The Commission considered the findings of the CNM SWG, which recommended that Curacao, Ecuador, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, 15    Thailand and Vietnam retain the same participatory rights in 2022 as they had in 2021. The CNM SWG also noted that in both 2020 and 2021, Nicaragua requested that the CNM SWG and the Commission consider revising their participatory rights to increase purse seine fishing from one to two vessels. Nicaragua indicated that the addition of one vessel would greatly assist in allowing the timely submission of financial contributions and further enhance their ability to implement WCPFC CMMs in the WCPFC Convention Area. CNM SWG participants were again unable to support the requested addition to Nicaragua’s participatory rights for 2023 due to the existing purse seine capacity limits as stipulated in paragraph 42 of the current TTM (CMM 2021-01). However, to assist the Commission with considering any increased participatory rights in the future, the CNM SWG invited Nicaragua to put forward any proposed changes to participatory rights when submitting their CNM application in future years, to allow TCC to properly consider the implications of such a request prior to the Commission’s annual meeting."
WCPFC19,50,WCPFC19 considered the request for participatory rights of CNM for 2023. The SWG considered an application from Nicaragua to increase its purse seine capacity from one vessel to two vessels. The Commission noted that the request has implications for capacity limits under paragraph 42 of CMM 2021-01 and recommended that any further capacity increase is considered when the relevant CMM is reviewed.
WCPFC19,51,"WCPFC19 approved the following participatory rights for 2023:   i. Curaçao: The participatory rights of Curacao are limited to carrier vessels to engage in transhipment activities in the Convention area.  ii. Ecuador: The participatory rights of Ecuador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2019-01 and CMM 2021-01 or its replacement measure.  iii. El Salvador: The participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. The total level of effort by purse seine vessels of El Salvador on the high seas shall not exceed 29 days in the Convention Area. Any introduction of purse seine fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2019-01 and CMM 2021-01 or its replacement measure.  iv. Liberia: The participatory rights of Liberia are limited to carrier vessels to engage in transhipment activities in the Convention area.  v. Nicaragua: The participatory rights of Nicaragua are limited to purse seine fishing for one vessel, with no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area. Any introduction of fishing capacity is to be in accordance with paragraph 12 of CMM 2019-01 and CMM 2021-01 or its replacement measure.  vi. Panama: The participatory rights of Panama in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels. Panama’s participatory rights also apply to vessels that supply food, water and spare parts to carrier vessels that engage in transhipment activities, provided that these vessels do not engage in activities supporting fishing vessels, including providing and/or servicing FADs.  16    vii. Thailand: The participatory rights of Thailand in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.  viii. Vietnam: The participatory rights of Vietnam in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.  WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area"
WCPFC19,52,"In accordance with the decision of WCPFC9 regarding the management of the overlap area of 4˚S and 50˚S between 130˚W and 150˚W, vessels flagged to Ecuador, El Salvador and Nicaragua and Panama will be governed by the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area."
WCPFC19,53,"In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area."
WCPFC19,54,"For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with international and domestic laws, vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area.   AGENDA ITEM 4  — NEW PROPOSALS"
WCPFC19,55,"In introducing this agenda item, the Chair noted that proponents of new proposals would provide brief outlines, and requested that CCMs limit comments to general statements and questions intended to clarify the proposals. She stated that WCPFC19-2022-DP12 Information Paper on the Bycatch of Pacific Bluefin Tuna in Set Net Fisheries in its Territorial Waters and WCPFC19-2022-DP15 Keeping track of Albatrosses were for information purposes and would be considered under the relevant agenda items, while WCPFC19-2022-DP11 Options for a Baseline of the “Large-Fish” Handline Fishery Fishing in Indonesia’s EEZ With Vessels >30GT for the WCPFC Tropical Tuna Measure would be introduced and considered under Agenda Item 6.3.1.2.  Proposed Revisions to the CMM for Sharks (WCPFC19-2022-DP01)"
WCPFC19,56,"The USA introduced proposed revisions to the CMM for Sharks (CMM 2019-04) as detailed in WCPFC19-2022-DP01 Proposed Revisions to the Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks. The USA stated it was pleased to present the proposal to the Commission, noting that oceanic whitetips are experiencing overfishing and are overfished, and silky sharks are overfished. It stated it had revised the measure as recommended by SC17, SC18, and TCC18. It detailed the changes to the proposal, and stated that if adopted the new provisions would go into effect in January 2024. The USA stated it had examined WCPFC regional observer data, which showed extra-tropical interactions with these species, and that the proposal consequently would apply the proposed mitigation measures across the entire WCPFC Convention Area."
WCPFC19,57,"Cook Islands on behalf of FFA members, thanked the USA and Canada for this proposal and the completed CMM 2013-06 assessment, which they stated was thorough, and provided ample consideration 17    of the potential impacts on SIDS. They stated that this is an important issue for FFA members, and noted that the use of wire traces and shark lines by longline vessels operating within FFA members’ waters is already prohibited through the Harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions, and that all sharks landed by vessels licensed to fish in FFA waters and those flagged to FFA require all fins to be naturally attached, or that finning is managed under alternative measures. However, they queried how the Commission would monitor the clause on trailing gear as prescribed in the proposed CMM, and stated they looked forward to further discussions on the proposal."
WCPFC19,58,"The EU acknowledged the efforts of the USA and Canada to reduce mortality for these species. It noted that a retention ban is in place, but stated that identifying additional mitigation measures can provide additional conservation benefits. The EU stated that its previous comments seem to not have been taken into account and expressed the hope that it would be possible to better capture the scientific advice and concerns that had been expressed."
WCPFC19,59,"Canada reiterated its support for the measure, which it stated is based on the best available science. To ensure the safety of crew and have the best survival rate for sharks, it noted that it is very important to have the information for safe handling practices. It stated that there is a need to demonstrate that WCPFC takes its responsibility for conservation of shark species very seriously, noting recent decisions by other international fora regarding shark conservation."
WCPFC19,60,"Chinese Taipei thanked the USA and Canada for their proposal, and sought clarification regarding paragraph 16, which indicates CCMs shall ensure their vessels do not carry or use wire traces, inquiring what constituted a vessel in the definition. The USA stated that vessels constituted those engaged in longline fisheries targeting tuna and billfish, noting this is referenced in paragraph 14 of the proposal."
WCPFC19,61,"RMI stated it supports the proposal. Regarding the Cook Islands’ comment, RMI stated FFA members had minimum terms and conditions for their in-zone fisheries and that there was a need for WCPFC to develop compatible measures."
WCPFC19,62,"Indonesia stated that this was a challenge for it to implement, noting it still faced problems caused by COVID-19."
WCPFC19,63,The Chair encouraged CCMs to engage with each other to resolve the outstanding issues.
WCPFC19,64,This issue was further considered under Agenda Item 8.1.2. Strengthening and Revising CMM 2009-06 in 2023 (WCPFC19-2022-DP02)
WCPFC19,65," The USA introduced its proposal to strengthen and revise CMM 2009-06 on Transhipment in 2023 (WCPFC19-2022-DP02 Strengthening and Revising WCPFC CMM 2009-06 on Transhipment in 2023).  The United States stated it remains concerned about the risks that transhipment represents in relation to supporting illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing operations and other criminal activities. To address this concern, the USA stated it supports to strengthening CMM 2009-06 to help address such concerns. It stated that at WCPFC15 the Commission agreed to conduct a review of CMM 2009-06, forming the TS-IWG to take on this task. Members agreed in the Scope of Work that the TS-IWG would seek to improve the regulation and monitoring of transhipment activities by “recommending amendments or other actions, if any, related to CMM 2009-06.” In September 2022, the 35th session of the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Committee on Fisheries (COFI) adopted voluntary guidelines on transhipment. These guidelines were developed over the course of several years through expert, technical, and member consultations. The COFI Voluntary Guidelines on Transshipment seek to decrease the risk of IUU caught fish entering the global seafood supply chain, and would strengthen sustainable and socially responsible fisheries. Most WCPFC members, including the United States, worked to develop the FAO 18    Guidelines on Transhipment with the objective that the Voluntary Guidelines would “assist States, regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), and other intergovernmental organizations, with respect to their development of new transhipment regulations or the review of existing regulations, with a view to integrating these within the broader regulatory framework for fisheries management.” The USA proposed that the TS-IWG be tasked with (a) reviewing CMM 2009-06 prior to TCC19; (b) considering the COFI guidelines, ensuring any proposed revisions align with or are more stringent than the guidelines, and taking into account the unique circumstances of small island developing states and territories; (c) meeting prior to TCC19 to prepare a draft proposed revisions to CMM 2009-06; and (d) presenting proposed revisions for consideration by WCPFC20."
WCPFC19,66,"RMI, on behalf of FFA members, thanked the USA for WCPFC19-2022-DP02, and stated that while recognising that the recommendations seek to progress the review of the Transhipment CMM, they also noted that there are terms of reference already in place that contain a clear process of activities, methodology and scheduling to guide the work of the Transhipment-IWG. While they supported the recommendations in principle, they stated they had clarifying questions and comments and looked forward to working with the USA to address those, including clarification from the TS-IWG Chairs on whether the transhipment analysis will be available by the first quarter of 2023, and regarding recommendation (b), emphasised that the revised Transhipment CMM would need to take into account the areas of assistance under ‘Recognition of the special requirements of small island developing states’ of Article 30 of the WCPFC Convention and in the FAO Voluntary Guidelines, as well as the need for a CMM 2013-06 assessment."
WCPFC19,67,"The EU supported the proposal, and expressed appreciation for the ongoing efforts on transhipment. It stated it looked forward to finally addressing the issue, in combination with the recently adopted FAO guidelines."
WCPFC19,68,"The Chair inquired of the TS-IWG Chair if the analysis would be available in the first quarter 2023? The Co-Chair stated that timeline is early 2023, but that a specific date had not been set, but would be discussed by the IWG."
WCPFC19,69, China suggested the meeting prior to TCC19 referenced in the proposed recommendation should not be restricted to being “in person”.
WCPFC19,70,"Indonesia stated it was very important to have an in-person meeting, and thanked the USA delegation for the proposal, and stated it would participate in the discussion."
WCPFC19,71,"The Chair noted that the Commission had heard positive comments and some concerns, and noted application of Article 30 and CMM 2013-06."
WCPFC19,72,Further discussions regarding the work of the TS-IWG were held under Agenda Item 11.4.2. FFA Positions on Key Issues for WCPFC19 (WCPFC19-2022-DP03)
WCPFC19,73,"Kiribati on behalf of FFA members introduced WCPFC19-2022-DP03 FFA Positions on Key Issues for WCPFC19, noting that FFA members priorities were also elaborated in WCPFC19-2022-DP04, -DP05, -DP06, -DP07, and -DP08. They highlighted their priorities and expected outcomes for WCPFC19 as follows: i) Agree to a management procedure for skipjack tuna in the WCPO, an important step in the effective management and sustainable use of the stock as detailed in WCPFC19-2022-DP04. 19    ii) Amend CMM 2014-06 on Establishing a Harvest Strategy for Key Fisheries and Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean to satisfy a requirement of the Marine Stewardship Council and ensure our fisheries retain their MSC certification, as detailed in WCPFC19-2022-DP06. iii) Adopt a strengthened Southwest Pacific swordfish measure, as detailed in WCPFC19-2022-DP07. iv) Agree on a focused process for reviewing the TTM in 2023 to adopt hard limits for the purse seine fishery in the high seas. v) Agree on a focused process for South Pacific albacore in 2023 to improve the management of this fishery, including agreement to review the management objective and TRP. vi) Amend CMM 2013-05 to require CCMs to routinely report their high seas catch and effort data in recognition that electronic reporting is a timely and more accurate way to provide this critical information, as detailed in WCPFC19-2022-DP05. vii) Assist the Commission in adopting EM SSPs; in support of this, FFA members provided their interim EM SSPs in WCPFC19-2022-DP08. viii) Continue to review and enhance the CMS. ix) Continue to progress the development of an effective CMM for improving labour standards for crew. x) Safely redeploy our observers from 1 January 2023.  FFA members stated they were ready to work with the Chair and other CCMs to ensure that WCPFC19 advances the work in support of the overall conservation and management of WCPO fish stocks. Draft CMM on a Management Procedure for WCPO Skipjack Tuna (WCPFC19-2022-DP04)"
WCPFC19,74,"FSM on behalf of FFA members introduced WCPFC19-2022-WP04 Draft Conservation and Management Measure on a Management Procedure for WCPO Skipjack Tuna, stating that in accordance with obligations under CMM 2014-06 (calling for the WCPFC to develop and implement harvest strategies for key stocks), FFA members were pleased to submit a draft CMM that describes an interim MP for skipjack tuna in the WCPO. They stated that the proposed interim MP is designed to improve decision-making by specifying predetermined levels of fishing on the WCPO skipjack tuna stock, based on the performance of the fishery. They indicated that this would better account for uncertainty, including uncertainties related to climate change, and would also be an important step in ensuring the effective management and sustainable use of the stock, and meeting the interests of global markets in sourcing sustainable tuna products. They noted that the draft CMM had been assessed against the requirements of CMM 2013-06."
WCPFC19,75,"Tuvalu on behalf of the PNA thanked FFA members for their introduction of the proposal, which they stated draws heavily on work by SPC and contributions from other delegations at SC and SMD01. They thanked all those who had contributed ideas on a skipjack MP. They noted that that the proposal followed the approach suggested by the PNA and Tokelau at SMD01, and includes a full skipjack MP with all the elements SPC has laid out. They noted some flexibility was needed to get the skipjack MP started, and stated that WCPFC19-2022-DP04 therefore proposes adoption of an interim skipjack MP with some flexibility about how it would be used. This would give all CCMs the opportunity to work with the skipjack MP until they are comfortable with adopting it fully. It might also allow some elements that are not yet fully detailed or agreed to be further developed over time. They stated they looked forward to working with other CCMs towards the adoption of this proposal."
WCPFC19,76,"The USA thanked the FFA members, and stated it had shared some questions directly with them and looked forward to resolving these with the objective of finalizing the MP at WCPFC19. 20"
WCPFC19,77,"Japan stated it appreciated the proposal, and that it had some concerns it would like to discuss under the appropriate agenda item, and stated it would be pleased to work with other CCMs on this."
WCPFC19,78,"The EU thanked FFA members for tabling the proposal, noting it was the result of many years of collaborative work, which the EU had supported. It stated it was very happy that WCPFC was close to adopting an MP. It noted it had some technical questions, but hoped that WCPFC19 could adopt and fully implement the MP."
WCPFC19,79,"Indonesia thanked FFA for providing WCPFC19-2022-DP04, stating it would like to have more understanding and discussion of the harvest control rule (HCR), which appeared different from the procedure presented by SPC. It stated it was interested in better understanding the treatment of catch and effort in archipelagic waters."
WCPFC19,80,"RMI stated it would lead a SWG to address the issues, because this was a key priority for FFA members. It stated that the goal would be to achieve consensus support for an outcome by the end of WCPFC19."
WCPFC19,81,The Chair stated that the proposal would be more fully discussed under Agenda Item 6.2.  Proposed Amendment to CMM 2013-05 (WCPFC19-2022-DP05)
WCPFC19,82,"New Zealand on behalf of FFA members introduced WCPFC19-2022-DP05 Proposed Amendment to CMM 2013-05 on Daily Catch and Effort Reporting. They noted that a proposal was tabled at WCPFC12 which led to adoption of CMM 2013-05. That proposal required vessel operators to maintain daily catch records; daily catch logs were required in FFA members’ EEZs, but the proposal at the time aimed to create an explicit requirement for such records to be kept for high seas fishing activities to improve the quality of data available for stock assessments. This led to the adoption by WCPFC12 of CMM 2013-05 on Daily Catch and Effort Reporting. New Zealand stated that FFA members were pleased to submit WCPFC19-2022-DP05, which proposes to amend CMM 2013-05 (and also contains a 2013-06 assessment). In summary, it proposes to require the master of a vessel to keep an accurate electronic log, and provide this information in accordance with the agreed WCPFC Standards, Specifications and Procedures (SSPs) for Electronic Reporting for operational catch and effort data to the national authority within 15 days of the end of the trip or upon exit from the WCPFC Convention Area, and where applicable, at the end of every transhipment event. In addition, the proposed amendment includes a requirement for flag CCMs to submit the required information to the Commission electronically in accordance with the agreed SSPs within 30 days of the end of a trip or upon exit from the WCPFC Convention Area; and where applicable at the end of every transhipment event. The proposed new requirement would be to submit these data to the Commission on a routine basis. FFA members stated that one of the benefits of ER is the ability to access the data in a timely manner. Having these data transmitted to the Commission on a routine basis would allow timely access by the Scientific Services Provider (SPC) as well as the WCPFC Secretariat for the science and compliance-related work of the Commission. They stated that they recognise that national authorities would want to vet the data submitted by their flagged vessels, which is why the timing for the reporting from flag vessels to their national authority is within 15 days and from national authority or CCMs to the Commission is within 30 days of the end of the trip, or upon exit from the WCPFC Convention Area, and where applicable at the end of a transhipment event. They noted that the proposed amendment does not replace the requirement to submit operational data by 30 April each year for the previous year. The submission of scientific data by 30 April would then be used by the Scientific Services Provider (SPC) to reconcile with what has been submitted routinely throughout the year. FFA members together with other CCMs at TCC18 recommended that WCPFC19 agree that CCMs should submit operational catch and effort data in accordance with the agreed Standards, Specifications and Procedures for Electronic Reporting in the WCPFC from 1 January 2024. FFA members also made this proposal at TCC17 (TCC17 Summary Report 21    paragraph 136), but stated that their efforts at TCC17 and TCC18 met with some opposition. The reason given was that some CCMs need time in order to be able to implement ER, and in recognition of this concern the CMM has a delayed implementation date of 1 January 2024. FFA members noted that they had already made a commitment to implement ER, while the PNA and Tokelau are already implementing ER for the purse seine fishery in their waters through their fishery management information system (FIMS). Vessel operators enter their data into FIMS daily and the relevant parties (authorities/vessel operator) are able to access this from the system immediately. FFA members stated that from the Annual Report on the performance of ER standards that was tabled to TCC18 (TCC18-2022-RP10), a number of CCMs are already implementing ER, including for their longline fleets. FFA members noted that WCPFC has talked about ER for a number of years, and stated it was time that it be put into place. They noted that FFA members had already made a commitment to adopt ER for fishing vessels fishing within its EEZs, and that this proposal is to put compatible measures in place for the high seas as called for by Article 8 of the Convention."
WCPFC19,83,"Japan supported the general approach, but stated it has some difficulties with the provisions as drafted. It stated it would raise these under the detailed discussions."
WCPFC19,84,"The USA stated it was in favour of adopting ER but had some concerns with how this could be adopted domestically, and would discuss the issues further."
WCPFC19,85,"The EU stated it was sympathetic in principle, and noted that its fleet already reports electronically, but that it had some concerns regarding the standards to be used. It stated it would welcome discussions with the proponents during WCPFC19."
WCPFC19,86,"China thanked FFA members for the proposal. It inquired why these suggested measures would apply only to the high seas, given that FFA members indicated they had already made a commitment to use ER in their EEZs. China suggested in that case the CMM should not be limited to the high seas. Regarding paragraph 3, coincidentally, China stated its fisheries would require daily ER reporting for all vessels operating in the high seas as of 1 January 2024. Thus, China would have little difficulty with that paragraph, although some domestic circumstances would need to be considered, such as instances where the ER equipment was not functioning, in which case a 30-day exemption might be allowed, similar to the situation of the WCPFC VMS system. China stated the details could be discussed with FFA directly. It stated it had issues with paragraph 4, noting that if the data were required for stock assessments, the stock assessment cycle is every 3 years, which indicates there is no urgency to acquire the data. The Chair encouraged China to work directly with New Zealand."
WCPFC19,87,"PNG, on behalf of PNA and Tokelau, stated they strongly support this proposal. They noted that the lack of effective control over longline fishing on the high seas is the single biggest weakness in the work of the Commission, and that this was a simple proposal that would contribute to addressing that weakness. They stated that the PNA and Tokelau already receive ER through the PNA FIMS, covering around 1.5 million tonnes of catch annually, or about 60% of the total catch of the major tuna stocks in the WCPO, and about 80% of the total catch excluding catches in Indonesia and Philippines waters. They stated that given that this was possible, the Commission had no excuse not to also implement ER. PNG stated that the PNA and Tokelau strongly supported the proposal."
WCPFC19,88,"Chinese Taipei stated it had implemented ER for many years in its distant water fishing fleet, with vessels required to report catch daily to the fisheries monitoring center. It stated it had some technical questions, which it would seek to discuss at WCPFC19, in the hope a mutually acceptable outcome could be found."
WCPFC19,89,"Indonesia noted the importance of operational catch and effort data, and stated that it had a plan to operate fisheries in the high seas in the future. It noted it had concerns about reporting to the Commission 22    within 30 days, and inquired whether the data reporting was for the purpose of stock assessments, or compliance, as this would have implications for timing."
WCPFC19,90,"Korea stated it supported ER should be in place for the entire WCPFC Convention Area as soon as practical, but stated that it was very important to ensure the compatibility between EEZs and the high seas in implementing ER. Korea noted that vessels should not have to implement two different standards in these areas. It inquired whether the existing system in FFA EEZs is consistent with the requirements for the Commission in the high seas, and stated it looked forward to addressing these issues in the SWG."
WCPFC19,91,"Following further discussions among CCMs in the ER SWG, led by New Zealand, the Chair noted the many positive comments and general support among CCMs, but observed that there were some concerns and technical details to be worked out. Proposed Amendment to CMM 2014-06 (WCPFC19-2022-DP06)"
WCPFC19,92,"PNG on behalf of FFA members introduced WCPFC19-2022-DP06 Proposed Amendment to CMM 2014-06 on Establishing a Harvest Strategy for Key Fisheries and Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, stating that FFA members proposed to amend CMM 2014-06 by including text that satisfies a specific requirement of the MSC Fishery Standard. The MSC allows for conditional certification of fisheries under its standard if there exists an agreement or framework that requires the relevant management body (WCPFC) to adopt HCRs before the stock declines below BMSY. They stated that the proposed amendment to the CMM did not alter the broader and more important requirement for the WCPFC to adopt well-defined HCRs for each of the tropical tuna stocks, but ensures that over 40 certified WCPO fisheries for South Pacific albacore, bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin will retain their certification while the work required to adopt well-defined HCRs is undertaken within the timeframe and to a standard required by MSC."
WCPFC19,93,The proposal was further addressed under Agenda Item 7. Revised Draft CMM for Southwest Pacific Swordfish (WCPFC19-2022-DP07)
WCPFC19,94,"Australia on behalf of FFA members introduced WCPFC19-2022-DP07 A Revised draft Conservation and Management Measure for Southwest Pacific Swordfish in the WCPFC Area, stating that FFA members were pleased to propose a strengthened CMM for Southwest Pacific swordfish highlighting: zone-based management, compatible management and limits for the high seas, sovereign rights of coastal states, and special requirements of SIDS and participating territories. They stated that the current CMM for Southwest Pacific swordfish does not address key elements required to ensure ongoing successful management of the swordfish fishery. Specifically, it contains no restrictions on fishing mortality on the high seas north of 20°S, lacks overall provisions to ensure sustainability of the stock, does not protect future development opportunities for SIDS, and does not distinguish between the fisheries targeting swordfish and fisheries for which swordfish is an important economic bycatch. They stated that they looked forward to working with members during WCPFC19 to progress the measure to meet the proposed objective and principles detailed in WCPFC19-2022-DP07."
WCPFC19,95,"The EU thanked Australia for the proposal. It agreed that the current CMM does not effectively cover all the fishery components that impact the stock, and stated there is scope for including all fishing north of 20°S. The EU stated it was committed to assisting Australia in doing this, but noted that the proposal included a number of elements that would make this rather challenging. The EU stated that the main objective should be to improve the current CMM."
WCPFC19,96,"China stated that during a bilateral meeting before the WCPFC19 it had expressed its concerns, including the need for a strong scientific basis for the total allowable catch (TAC). It agreed on the need to 23    allocate bycatch, but remarked on the need for a longer period for the average. Regarding the target fisheries for Southwest Pacific swordfish, it stated that observer coverage should be compatible between the high seas and EEZs. Regarding EM and the review rate, China hoped this could be decided after the Commission’s decision on EM."
WCPFC19,97,"This proposal was further considered under Agenda Item 6.8.2. FFA Final Draft EM SSPs, endorsed as Interim Guidelines (WCPFC19-2022-DP08)"
WCPFC19,98,"FSM on behalf of FFA members introduced WCPFC19-2022-DP08 Information Paper on the FFA Final Draft EM SSPs endorsed as Interim Guidelines, stating that FFA members were committed to strengthening the monitoring of fisheries under the jurisdiction of the Commission, particularly those that lack independent verifiable data. They noted FFA members worked hard to progress EM and acknowledged the complexities of this work. FFA members progressed the development of EM SSPs over the prior 12 months. In May 2022, FFC122 endorsed the FFA Final Draft EM SSPs as interim guidelines, noting these will continue to be reviewed and revised as members work to implement EM across FFA-member EEZs. FFA members stated that they were pleased to share this work with the WCPFC, as an information paper (WCPFC19-2022-DP08), to help progress the work on the development of EM SSPs by the ER&EM Working Group and with the aim of ensuring compatibility and complementarity of EM frameworks across the WCPFC Convention Area. Measure to be implemented by the Philippines in the high seas adjacent to its EEZ (WCPFC19-2022-DP09) and Desire to Prescribe the Use of Carrier Vessels with Freezing Capacity in HSP1-SMA (WCPFC19-2022-DP10)"
WCPFC19,99,The Philippines introduced WCPFC19-2022-DP09 Informing the Commission of the Measure that the Philippines will implement in the High Seas Adjacent to the EEZ of the Philippines and WCPFC19-2022-DP10 Informing the Commission of the desire to Prescribe the Use of Carrier Vessels with Freezing Capacity in High Seas Pockets 1 Special management Area (HSP1-SMA).
WCPFC19,100,"Palau on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau stated regarding DP09 that they needed more information to consider the proposal, noting for example, that the proposal refers to fishing activity in the high seas adjacent to the EEZ east of the Philippines. However, they stated they were unaware of any WCPFC CMM providing for access by Philippines vessels to any areas of the high seas adjacent to the EEZ east of the Philippines. They noted that they are aware of the important Special Arrangement for traditional group seine vessel operations in High Seas Pocket 1, but stated that area isn’t adjacent to the Philippines EEZ. They reiterated their particular concern regarding additional fishing impacts in the area indicated by the Philippines, and requested further information before considering the proposal further."
WCPFC19,101,"Kiribati on behalf of FFA members stated that the Philippines had sought to get access for boats with freezers on the high seas on several occasions in the last few years, but stated that this was contrary to the original intent of Attachment 2 of CMM 2021-01, which was focused on the operations of traditional fishers. FFA members stated that if Philippine freezer boats are allowed in High Seas Pocket 1, they are likely to displace the majority of traditional fishers. It is also likely to result in a significant increase in fishing effort in this area, as they will be able to stay on the fishing grounds for much longer, potentially affecting the sustainability of tuna stocks. They also raised concerns that this may result in an expansion of fishing operations into High Sea Pocket 2. FFA members noted that the use of refrigerated carriers is likely to have an impact on SIDS members and participating territories in the WCPFC Convention Area, but the Philippines has not provided an assessment meeting the requirements of CMM 2013-06.  FFA members stated that they do not support the proposal. 24"
WCPFC19,102,"Following further discussions during WCPFC19 between the Philippines and other CCMs regarding WCPFC19-2022-DP09 and WCPFC19-2022-DP10, Niue, on behalf of FFA members, suggested that the Philippines submit a proposal relating to the issues in WCPFC19-2022-DP09 during the review of CMM 2021-01 in 2023.  Incorporating Climate Change within WCPFC (WCPFC19-2022-DP14)"
WCPFC19,103,"The USA submitted WCPFC19-2022-DP14, which proposed that the Commission adopt the following: “Recognizing the urgency of developing a comprehensive approach to understanding and addressing the impacts of climate change on highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area, and any related impacts on the economies of CCMs and food security and the livelihoods of their people, in particular SIDS and participating territories, the Commission tasks TCC and NC to include Climate Change as a standing agenda item and to prioritize discussion of how best to incorporate climate change information and analyses in their work”."
WCPFC19,104,"Korea stated that climate change affects every aspect of life, including fisheries, noting that sea level rise and temperature increase can have a significant impact on livelihoods. Korea thanked the USA and supported the proposal."
WCPFC19,105,China supported the proposal.
WCPFC19,106,"Tokelau on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau supported the proposal, stating it marked a step forward after passing a landmark climate resolution at WCPFC16. They stated that the proposal highlights that the climate change issue has become established in the SC agenda and proposes to strengthen consideration of climate change in the work of the Commission by including climate change as standing agenda items in the NC and TCC. They suggested that the proposal could be extended so as to include climate change as a standing item on the agenda of the annual Commission meetings."
WCPFC19,107,The EU strongly supported the proposal.
WCPFC19,108,"Chinese Taipei stated that the issue is very important for everyone, and is affecting all countries, and supported the proposal."
WCPFC19,109,Indonesia supported the proposal.
WCPFC19,110,"In response to Tokelau, the USA stated it would be happy to modify its proposal to include climate change as a standing item for the Commission as well as all subsidiary body meetings."
WCPFC19,111,The issue of climate change was further discussed under Agenda Item 8.4.1.  Philippines letter to the Commission on VMS (WCPFC19-2022-DP16)
WCPFC19,112,"The Philippines requested limited extension of the approval for its ARGOS ALC/MTU transponders (which expires 1 January 2023) pending a Commission decision on its proposed replacement, the VMS-100Si."
WCPFC19,113,"Japan noted that lengthy discussion on the VMS-100Si at TCC16 and TCC17, stating that its concerns were raised over these units because they are based on the AIS system, and signal transmission can be disrupted from time to time. Japan stated it was not confident at that time of their acceptability, and the Philippines did not submit additional information to TCC18. Japan noted that its technical staff were not present at WCPFC19, and requested that the Philippines provide additional information to TCC so that its proposal could be considered. 25"
WCPFC19,114,The issue was further discussed under Agenda Item 6.3.1. NC18 Proposal for Harvest Strategy for North Pacific Albacore (WCPFC19-2022-17)
WCPFC19,115,"The NC Chair introduced WCPFC19-2022-17 (Attachment A) Harvest Strategy for North Pacific Albacore. He stated that the stock is not likely overfished and is not likely experiencing overfishing. The NC proposed the following:  i) TRP = F45%, which is the fishing intensity (F) level that results in the stock producing 45% of spawning potential ratio (SPR) ii) a threshold reference point (SSBthreshold) = 30%SSBcurrent,F=0, which is 30% of the dynamic unfished spawning stock biomass iii) LRP =14% SSBcurrent,F=0, which is 14% of the dynamic unfished spawning stock biomass. The NC Chair recommended that the Commission review and hopefully adopt the proposal."
WCPFC19,116,The issue was further discussed under Agenda Item 6.5.2. NC18 Proposal for a CMM for North Pacific Swordfish (WCPFC19-2022-17)
WCPFC19,117,"The NC Chair introduced WCPFC19-2022-17 (Attachment B) Draft Conservation and Management Measure for North Pacific Swordfish, and noted that there is currently no CMM for this stock, which is in good condition (not likely overfished and not likely experiencing overfishing). The NC introduced the CMM in order to maintain effort at the current level, and recommended that the Commission review and hopefully adopt the proposal."
WCPFC19,118,The issue was further addressed under Agenda Item 6.7.1.
WCPFC19,119,All proposals tabled for WCPFC19 consideration were introduced and proponents of proposals were encouraged to discuss them at the margins of the meeting and to report back their progress to plenary.   AGENDA ITEM 5  — SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES 5.1 Implementation of Article 30 of WCPFC Convention and CMM 2013-07 (SIDS special requirements)
WCPFC19,120,"The Chair noted that paragraph 20 of CMM 2013-07 requires an annual review of implementation of this measure, and referenced WCPFC19-2022-IP01 Summary from Part 2 CMM 2013-07 paragraph 19 annual reports. The report was taken as read. The Executive Director noted there was no discussion in the ODF."
WCPFC19,121,"Tonga on behalf of FFA members thanked all CCMs that provided reports on their assistance to SIDS. They noted that the full recognition of the special requirements of SIDS is a cornerstone of fisheries governance in the region, and stated that during the negotiations of the WCPF Convention, FFA members noted that Article 30 is the “foundation” upon which the convention is built upon, which underscores the importance that FFA members attach to the full recognition of the special requirements of SIDS. They stated that to appreciate the significance of the agenda item to SIDS, it was only necessary to look at the map of 26    the region, which shows States with responsibility to manage fisheries over vast areas of ocean with associated development aspirations. FFA members noted they had introduced initiatives such as CMM 2013-06 (the criteria to be applied when considering proposals for measures) and CMM 2013-07 (overarching principles in support of the full recognition of our special requirements). To improve the implementation of CMM 2013-06 FFA members stated they have repeatedly called for accurate and complete assessments on the impacts of proposals that take into account the views of SIDS. They noted with appreciation the efforts that CCMs have taken to provide comprehensive 2013-06 assessments to accompany proposals to WCPFC19, while noting an assessment that is inaccurate and incomplete will not comply with the binding requirements in that measure. FFA members noted the significance of CMM 2013-07, which provides principles that also take into account provisions in the UNFSA. They invited other CCMs to take into account CMM 2013-07 when providing their reports. They stated that Article 30 of the Convention and CMM 2013-06 and 13-07 provide a robust framework for the full recognition of SIDS’ special requirements. They noted that it is up to SIDS to determine what their special requirements are, and to determine their domestic development aspirations. They continued to call on developed CCMs to provide targeted assistance that is aligned with SIDS’ domestic development aspirations and SIDS’ special requirements."
WCPFC19,122,"The EU stated it had submitted a delegation paper (WCPFC19-2022-DP13) detailing its contributions, focussing on the Pacific–European Union Marine Partnership Programme, which it stated is the EU’s flagship program in the Pacific, implemented by FFA, SPC, SPREP, and USP. The EU stated the programme was being extended until April 2025. The EU invited CCMs to visit the program website and to engage with the implementing agencies. The EU noted that CMM 2013-06 was agreed to by all CCMs, but stated that implementation had proved challenging. It suggested that there is scope for clarifying the process to enable CCMs to understand, address, and submit proposals that meet the respective requirements."
WCPFC19,123,"Japan stated that it fully recognizes the importance of the criteria in CMM 2013-06. When submitting a proposal, Japan stated it looks carefully at the checklist in CMM 2013-06, and will continue to do so. Japan stated it appreciated the opportunities to exchange views with FFA and PNA members, and noted that following several years of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was a great pleasure to be at WCPFC19 in person. Japan stated it would like to maintain and enhance its close relationship with SIDS and actively engage in a dialogue for achieving the goal of conservation and sustainable use of the highly migratory species. Japan stated it has been providing SIDS with overseas development assistance for infrastructure and capacity building through the Japan International Cooperation Agency and the Overseas Fishery Cooperation Foundation (OFCF) of Japan.  During 2011–2020, Japan provided about ¥214 billion in development assistance, including fishery-related projects to Pacific Island countries. Fishery-related projects cover conservation and management of highly migratory species and assistance to small-scale fishermen. Also, at the Ninth Pacific Leaders Meeting held virtually in July 2021, Japan announced its commitment to the continuation of its robust development assistance and more than 5,500 people-to-people exchanges and human resource development for the next three years. Japan stated that in 2008 it established the Japan Trust Fund within WCPFC, which has been providing capacity building assistance to SIDS for improving fishery statistics and management. Japan stated that a call for proposals was sent to CCMs on November 18 (WCPFC Circular No 2022/88), and expressed the hope that SIDS CCMs would actively consider their applications by the deadline of 15 December. Japan stated it has also supported SIDS since 2008 through the Japan Promotion Fund (JPF) via OFCF. SIDS can use the JPF for various purposes such as enhancement of management capacity. In November 2017, in response to the strong request from SIDS, OFCF signed an agreement with FFA to renew the term of the JPF for another 10 years until 2027. Also, in 2020, OFCF increased the size of the JPF. Japan stated that it sincerely hopes that these programs and funds will contribute to fishery development of SIDS."
WCPFC19,124,"Korea stated that it takes its obligations related to the special requirements of SIDS very seriously. It stated it provided information on this in its Annual Report submitted to TCC18, and noted that its national 27    budget for various overseas development assistance has been increasing. Korea stated it looks forward to strengthening its cooperative relationship with SIDS."
WCPFC19,125,The USA stated it is committed to building the capacity of SIDS and territories and takes seriously its responsibility under CMM 2013-07 to report to the Commission on these.
WCPFC19,126,WCPFC19 reaffirmed the importance of the implementation of Article 30 and CMM 2013-07 and recognized the importance of assessing the impact of proposals on SIDS according to CMM 2013-06. 5.2 Updated Strategic Investment Plan
WCPFC19,127,"The Updated Strategic Investment Plan (WCPFC19-2022-08) was posted on the WCPFC19 ODF (as Topic B), where no comments were received. The Chair noted that the specific purpose of the plan is to match capacity needs and requirements of developing states and territories with appropriate investment strategies."
WCPFC19,128,"Fiji on behalf of FFA members thanked the Secretariat for the report. They noted and supported the updated Strategic Investment Plan, and stated their understanding that there may be other needs identified by CCMs during TCC19’s review of dCMRs when developing the Provisional CMR."
WCPFC19,129,The Commission approved the updated Strategic Investment Plan for 2022 (WCPFC19-2022-09). (Attachment F).   AGENDA ITEM 6  — WCPO TUNA AND BILLFISH STOCKS  6.1  General Overview of Status of WCPO stocks
WCPFC19,130,"Dr. John Hampton (SPC) made a presentation on recent fisheries information and the status of tuna and billfish stocks assessed by SPC. As references he noted WCPFC19-2022-IP02_rev1 The Western and Central Pacific Tuna Fishery:2021 Overview and Status of Stocks and the WCPFC Tuna Fishery Yearbook 2021. Total tuna catch for 2021 is estimated to have been 2.64 million tonnes, about average for the past decade. The purse seine catch in 2021 likewise was estimated to be at the average level of the past decade, but the provisional longline catch in 2021 is the lowest since 1991. Purse seine effort, as estimated from VMS data, has been stable with 2020, 2021 and 2022 (to end October) effort, very similar to the 2012-2021 average. Longline effort, as indicated by VMS, for 2020 and 2021 was also very similar to the 2012-2021 average, but effort in 2022 looks to be tracking at about 15% higher than in recent years. In the tropical longline fishery, bigeye and yellowfin catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) has been stable if not slightly increasing over the past decade, after earlier declines. In the South Pacific longline fishery, albacore CPUE has declined steadily and continuously since the late 1990s, with the 2021 CPUE the lowest seen in the fishery for several decades. All four key tuna stocks (skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye and South Pacific albacore) are currently neither overfished nor is overfishing estimated to be occurring. However, the ratio of spawning biomass to the unfished level has continued to fall in the case of skipjack and South Pacific albacore, while some stabilisation has occurred for yellowfin and bigeye. Future projections using status quo fishing conditions indicate that overfishing conditions are unlikely to occur for skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye, but there is a small probability of the LRP being breached for South Pacific albacore in the short term because of a recent estimated decline in recruitment. Recent assessments of Southwest Pacific swordfish and Southwest Pacific striped marlin indicate that the former is not overfished and overfishing is unlikely to be occurring, but 28    Southwest Pacific striped marlin is estimated to be in an overfished state with recent fishing mortality being close to the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) level. Considerable uncertainty is associated with both of these assessments."
WCPFC19,131,"Indonesia stated the presentation and associated paper were very useful in understanding the fishery in the WCPO, and inquired, with reference to WCPFC19-2022-IP02, page 42, which CCM was responsible for the substantial catch of yellowfin in the western edge of the WCPFC Convention Area. The presenter indicated that this catch was attributable to Vietnam."
WCPFC19,132,"Japan stated that the stock status presentation indicated all species had been in a consistent decline since the 1970s in terms of stock status, but that the future projections indicate that status will be stable or improve, and asked why. Japan also requested that SPC provide the CPUE trend for longline fisheries north of 20°N, as done for areas 20°N to 10°S, and south of 10°S, noting that Japanese fishermen have suffered from poor CPUE, especially in the northern portion of the WCPFC Convention Area. SPC stated that the CPUE trend for the area north of 20°N could be provided, and would be posted on the meeting website. Regarding the perceived decline in stock status, Dr Hampton stated the projections are initially heavily influenced by recent recruitment, and as age classes move out then recruitment is determined by sampling from the historic past. He also noted that albacore is a special case, with a severe recruitment decline that was based on the weakest part of the data series, and not necessarily reflective of actual recruitment."
WCPFC19,133,"Dr. Shui-Kai Chang, ISC Vice-Chair, provided a brief presentation on the stock status of the Pacific bluefin tuna and the NP swordfish. He stated that ISC has conducted an update assessment on Pacific bluefin tuna and two benchmark assessments on western and north Pacific Ocean (WCNPO) striped marlin and North Pacific Ocean (NPO) blue shark in 2022. For Pacific bluefin tuna, model structure used was the same as 2020 assessment, with minor changes and errors corrected and additional 2 years data inputs. No biomass-based and fishing mortality-based reference points have been adopted for Pacific bluefin tuna. Relative to potential reference points adopted for other tunas, the assessment results suggested that the stock is overfished but overfishing is not occurring. The Pacific bluefin tuna stock is recovering faster than expected, and the spawning biomass reached its initial rebuilding target in 2019, 5 years earlier than originally anticipated by the RFMOs, and it is very likely the second rebuilding target (20%SSB0 with 60% probability) will be achieved (probabilities > 90%) by 2029. ISC recommended continuing monitoring of recruitment and spawning biomass as well as research on a recruitment index. The results of projections from sensitivity models with lower productivity assumptions show that this conservation information is robust to uncertainty in stock productivity. SC18 noted that the results of updated stock assessment, which suggest that the measures incorporated in CMM 2021-02 appear to be working as intended. SC18 recommended that the Commission exercise a precautionary approach when it considers any revisions to the current CMM considering that the stock is still in a depleted state, and further welcomed ISC’s effort on further investigation of structural uncertainty to incorporate it in future management advice. For WCNPO striped marlin, a benchmark assessment was planned and conducted in 2022 with several improvements to address data and model uncertainties, which were endorsed by the ISC Plenary (ISC22). However, ISC considers this modelling to be a work in progress because of a significant issue with the choice of growth curve, which does not fully represent stock productivity. ISC22 therefore approved a work plan to explore the growth curve and complete a benchmark assessment for 2023. In this regard, ISC reiterated the stock status and conservation information based on 2019 assessment, which show that under current conditions the stock is likely overfished and is likely subject to overfishing relative to MSY-based reference points. If the stock continues to experience recruitment consistent with the short-term recruitment scenario (2012-2016), then catches must be reduced to 60% of the WCPFC catch quota from CMM 2010-01 (3,397 t) to 1,359 t in order to achieve a 60% probability of rebuilding to 20%SSB0 by 2022. In response to a request of WCPFC18, the ISC concluded that reference points for WCNPO striped marlin will be provided with reference to MSY and with reference to 20%SSBF=0 averaged over the recent 20-year time frame (2001-2020). ISC also recognized uncertainty in some assessment inputs and some conflicts in the data; when developing a conservation and 29    management measure to rebuild the resource, it is recommended that these issues be recognized and carefully considered. The SC18 concurred with the ISC22 that the assessment is a work in progress and looks forward to the ISC billfish working group (BILLWG) workplan to explore the growth curve and complete a benchmark assessment for approval at ISC23. SC18 agreed that the conservation and management advice for WCNPO striped marlin will be carried forward from 2019."
WCPFC19,134,"The EU noted that the WCNPO striped marlin stock assessment had been deferred to 2023. The EU stated that this had happened for several years, which impacts the ability to take action on this stock. The EU noted that the data conflicts and data gaps issues had been flagged for several years, and asked whether these had been indeed overcome. The presenter stated that the benchmark assessment could not be completed because of issues regarding the choice of the growth curve. He noted that the benchmark assessment could likely be completed next year. Japan stated that the BILLWG is currently holding a meeting in Japan, and the specific issue of the choice of the growth curve was being discussed at that meeting. Japan noted that ISC was well aware of the need to provide results, and fully expected that it would provide an updated assessment in 2023."
WCPFC19,135,"WCPFC19 noted with appreciation the presentations by the Scientific Services Provider and the ISC on the status of WCPFC tuna and billfish stocks. 30   6.2 Skipjack, Bigeye and Yellowfin"
WCPFC19,136,"The Chair introduced this agenda by highlighting three issues: harvest strategy-related issues, including the MP for skipjack; TRPs for the three species; and a review of the current TTM. She stated that the meeting would also consider a process for negotiation of a new or revised TTM in 2023. She noted the following document prepared by the Secretariat: WCPFC19-2022-09 Reference document for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna for the review of CMM 2021-01 and development of harvest strategies under CMM 2014-06. 6.2.1 Harvest Strategy Issues 6.2.1.1 Update on review of target reference point for skipjack"
WCPFC19,137,"Dr. Graham Pilling (SPC-OFP) gave a brief presentation to provide context to the consideration of a TRP for skipjack, with reference to WCPFC19-2022-10 Evaluations to support decisions on the WCPO skipjack tuna target reference point based upon the 2022 stock assessment. This provides the results of SC18-requested analyses to update SC18-MI-WP-09 (Table 2) to include evaluations based on the 2022 skipjack assessment using the same settings as in that paper and include the projected outcomes for a set of candidate TRP options ranging between 40% to 60% depletion ratios (SB/SBF=0). The baseline future fishing levels were namely: i) 2012 effort level for purse seine fisheries (SC18 request); ii) 2001-2004 average effort level for pole and line fisheries (SMD01 request); and iii) 2016-2018 average catch level for small scale fisheries in Region 5 of the model (Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam. Assumption consistent with SC18-MI-WP-09). To achieve candidate depletion levels, the future purse seine effort levels only were raised or lowered. Under ‘baseline’ fishing levels the WCPO skipjack stock is predicted, on average, to fall very slightly compared to ‘recent’ levels (being the 2018-2021 average spawning biomass depletion = 51%SBF=0), to 50%SBF=0. This is 17% below 2012 depletion levels (61%SBF=0). Examining the ten other median depletion levels requested by SC18: i) depletion levels of 40% to 48%SBF=0 imply increases in purse seine effort from 2012 levels by 10% to 52% and imply declines of 6 to 21% in spawning biomass depletion compared to recent assessed levels; ii) depletion levels of 52% to 60%SBF=0 imply decreases in purse seine effort from 2012 levels by 10% to 40% and imply increases in spawning biomass depletion compared to recent assessed levels."
WCPFC19,138,"Vanuatu, on behalf of FFA members, thanked SPC for updating Table 2 in SC18-2022-WP09 to include evaluations based on the new 2022 skipjack tuna assessment. They noted that the table was very helpful in informing the review of the TRP for skipjack tuna and should be the cornerstone for discussions on this topic. They stated that the results of the updated analysis show that the two values being used to calculate the TRP in the interim MP for skipjack tuna proposed by FFA members in WCPFC19-2022-DP04 would result in no change in purse seine effort from 2012 levels and only a minor (-2%) change in spawning biomass depletion from recent 2018-2021 levels. They also noted that this TRP is consistent with the previous interim TRP agreed to at WCPFC12. It has zero risk of breaching the LRP, and includes an updated stock-related element, which takes into account the effects of increases in reported skipjack tuna catches in Indonesia and the Philippines, changes to the TTM in 2017, and changes in the skipjack assessment model. They stated that it will also be the most precautionary TRP for any major tropical tuna stock in the world. FFA members stated that for these reasons they are confident that the adoption of this TRP and the interim MP for skipjack tuna proposed in WCPFC19-2022-DP04 would go a long way to ensuring that the biological, economic and social objectives of this critically important stock are achieved."
WCPFC19,139,"The EU inquired regarding the implications of the fact that the average baseline 2001-2004 pole and line effort levels are 159% greater than in 2021. SPC stated if the projection assumes that effort will be equal to the 2001-2004 level, while actual effort is less, this suggests the stock will be less depleted than the projections indicate. The EU inquired how precautionary this is, is it significant? SPC stated that if 2021 levels were run into future it would get to about 55% of unfished levels."
WCPFC19,140,"Japan stated that in the 2019 stock assessment the depletion level in 2012 was 42%, and the 2016–2018 depletion level was also around 42%, suggesting it could be used as a baseline. The current stock assessment indicates a depletion level in 2012 of around 61%, with 2018-2021 depletion of about 50%. Japan noted that this suggests a different situation and trend, and inquired why these changes occurred between the 2019 and 2022 stock assessments, and which stock assessment SPC considered more trustworthy? Japan noted that references were now made to both, and stated that the proposed harvest strategy or MP all are based on the 2019 stock assessment."
WCPFC19,141,"SPC stated that significant changes were made between the 2019 and 2022 stock assessments, and that SPC considers the 2022 stock assessment to be an improvement over the 2019 stock assessment; the 2022 assessment shows a pattern of decline that was not apparent in the 2019 assessment. SPC stated that the 2022 stock assessment includes a purse seine index of abundance, which may have contributed to the depletion trend in that stock assessment. SPC stated that it was necessary to separate the full stock assessment from the work that underpins harvest strategy, which are different. The stock assessment used in the harvest strategy looks at the past, while the stock assessment models seek to capture future uncertainties, with other models on effort creep and recruitment uncertainty included in the projections. Therefore the 2022 stock assessment is considered the best available science in terms of assessing overall stock status, while the 2019 models are used for a different purpose in the harvest strategy work."
WCPFC19,142,"Tuvalu on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau thanked SPC for the table of recalibrated candidate TRPs and related explanation based on the 2022 assessment, and stated it was what they requested at WCPFC18, SC18 and SMD01. They noted the significant changes in the table, and stated their understanding that these results from changes in the skipjack fisheries and the science, and stated that these were broadly in the direction that PNA expected when they requested the table; in particular they were concerned about the effects on the potential TRP of increases in skipjack catches since the previous assessment. These changes include the increased catches in archipelagic waters of some developing coastal states, the effects of the changes to the TTM in 2017, and the effect of overfishing of high seas purse seine effort limits in recent years. They noted that the changes would require a large reduction in purse seine effort with associated economic costs. The overall result indicates that it is no longer reasonable to base the TRP, wholly or partially, on maintaining 2012 stock conditions. They stated that the fishery has moved on and consideration 31    of a TRP has to take into account the changes that have occurred. Given that the stock is assessed as one of the healthiest tropical tuna stocks, they stated that in their view it makes no sense to be considering large cuts in purse seine effort in response to the changes that have occurred, stating that would be unfair to the SIDS in whose waters purse seining largely takes place, and those involved in the operations of the purse seine fishery. On that basis, PNA and Tokelau, with their FFA colleagues, stated they had proposed an updated TRP in the draft skipjack management procedure. It is based on maintaining 2012 purse seine effort and recent stock conditions in 2018-2021. This would maintain a TRP of 50% spawning biomass depletion ratio using the 2022 assessment results. This approach would preserve the existing fishing opportunities for the purse seine fishery, and recent stock conditions for all involved in the skipjack fisheries, while taking account of the changes in the fishery that have already occurred. They stated it is consistent with the approach previously used to determine the interim skipjack TRP; avoids potential additional impacts on other fisheries for skipjack, including artisanal fisheries; and should generally avoid potential additional impacts on other target stocks and non-target species. In addition, it will be the most precautionary TRP of any major tropical tuna stock globally. They stated that they looked forward to positive discussions on this proposed TRP."
WCPFC19,143,"Japan, in response to the preceding interventions by other CCMs, stated its understanding that the current operating procedures and estimation models are based on 2019 stock assessment, which estimated 42% depletion level in 2012 which was a candidate TRP proposed by PNA, and observed that if the Commission continues to use this model, then recent depletion may be roughly equal to 2012 levels, meaning fishing effort may need not to be reduced. However, Japan stated that according to the results of the 2022 stock assessment, recent depletion is far lower than 2012 level and there may be a need to reduce effort in some fisheries. Japan stated that SC agreed on use of the 2019 stock assessment, and asked if that means the estimation model would continue to be based on 2019 model for 3 years?"
WCPFC19,144,"SPC stated that the role of the TRP in the harvest strategy is to provide an indicator of performance to indicate whether the harvest strategy will keep the stock around a given level into the future. The approach suggested by FFA would recalculate values in the harvest strategy, but this would not change the HCR or the estimation method."
WCPFC19,145,WCPFC19 noted with appreciation the presentation by the Scientific Services Provider on the target reference point for skipjack tuna. 6.2.1.2 Review of additional work tasked by the SMD01 and adoption of management procedures for skipjack tuna.
WCPFC19,146,"Dr. Rob Scott (SPC-OFP) presented WCPFC19-2022-11A_rev 1 (Updates to management procedure evaluations for WCPO skipjack and PIMPLE since SMD01), which briefly summarises the discussions of the SMD01 and presented the results of additional analyses requested at both SC18 and SMD01 to progress the development of a harvest strategy for WCPO skipjack. The requested work included the evaluation of HCRs 6 and 9, including a 10% constraint on changes in catch and effort levels similar to that previously applied to HCRs 1, 2 and 5; the revision of baseline catch and effort levels assumed for the evaluations (purse seine 2012 effort, pole and line 2001-04 effort, and the domestic fisheries in assessment region 5 on 2016-18 catch); and the evaluation of additional ‘robustness’ scenarios to investigate the performance of candidate MPs under persistent low recruitment in the future. In addition, the SMD01 requested further information on which fisheries would be exempt from the control of the management procedure and requested that a number of revisions be made to the PIMPLE software that was developed to allow members to interrogate the results of the evaluations and to assist in the process of selecting a preferred MP. The results of all of the requested analyses are presented in WCPFC19-2022-11A_rev 1 and specific information on the performance of the five candidate management procedures is available on the interactive 32    online app https://ofp-sam.shinyapps.io/PIMPLE_WCPFC19/. The presentation also noted that a ‘dry run’ analysis had been conducted (WCPFC19-2022-11B) to illustrate the hypothetical implementation of a skipjack management procedure in 2022 using data up to 2021. It was noted that, if an MP was adopted at WCPFC19, this process would be repeated, using updated data, in 2023."
WCPFC19,147,"PNG on behalf of FFA members thanked SPC for undertaking the additional work tasked by the SMD01 to help the Commission make informed decisions on adoption of an MP for skipjack, noting it had informed development of the interim MP for skipjack proposed by FFA members in WCPFC19-2022-DP04. They noted with interest that all five MPs retained by the SMD01 result in the spawning depletion ratio being slightly above the target in the short to medium-term and at, or very close to, the target in the long-term. They stated that all five MPs also perform well in terms of stock sustainability and maintaining the fishery’s overall stability, but HCR 9 which drives FFA’s proposed interim MP is the most effective at maintaining effort around the baseline in the short term. They stated they consider this a desirable characteristic because it preserves the existing fishing opportunities for the purse seine fishery, and is one reasons FFA members chose HCR 9. They stated there are other reasons for their choice of HCR 9, but invited initial responses from CCMs on the proposed interim MP, noting their intent to have it implemented from 2023."
WCPFC19,148,"Indonesia inquired, regarding Table 5, whether the handline catch in 2021 was 0 (no catch), and if so why it was included. Regarding the HCR, Indonesia stated that No. 2 and No. 9 appeared quite similar in terms of outcome. It inquired if there were factors restricting the choice of HCR. SPC stated it would be problematic to adopt more than one HCR, and that SPC proposed to have a single HCR. SPC noted the performance of the HCRs (2 and 9) is quite similar, with differences in the performance indicators."
WCPFC19,149,"Tuvalu on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau thanked FFA members for introducing the proposal, and thanked those who contributed to the discussions on harvest strategies and on a skipjack MP in particular. They noted that the proposal draws heavily on the discussion and outcomes from SC and the recent SMD01, and that it had been greatly helped by the various capacity building exercises supported by the Commission, offering their thanks in particular the staff involved at SPC, led by Dr Graham Pilling, and Dr Rob Campbell, convenor of the Management Issues theme at SC. The PNA and Tokelau also thanked the Chair, for her support of the Commission’s Harvest Strategy work, including as co-Chair of SMD01 along with the SC Chair. They stated that the proposal was prepared in the spirit of what PNA and Tokelau understand is the essence of the Harvest Strategy approach, the aim of which is to improve decision-making by having pre-agreed rules for how fishing will be adjusted as the status of stocks changes, and taking better account of uncertainty. In that direction, they specifically tried to develop an interim MP based on the status quo, that does not advantage or disadvantage any CCMs or sector. They stated their hope other CCMs would find this proposal useful and looked forward to their consideration of it."
WCPFC19,150,CCMs undertook further discussions of the skipjack MP in the SWG.
WCPFC19,151,"The Chair of the SWG, Ms Berry Muller (RMI), subsequently advised on 3 December that consensus had been reached on the draft CMM on a Management Procedure for Skipjack Tuna."
WCPFC19,152,WCPFC19 adopted CMM 2022-01 Conservation and Management Measure on a Management Procedure for WCPO Skipjack Tuna. (Attachment G) 6.2.1.3 Agree on the target reference point for bigeye and yellowfin
WCPFC19,153,"Dr. Steven Hare (SPC-OFP) presented WCPFC19-2022-12 WCPO bigeye and yellowfin TRP evaluations (with updated 2022 skipjack assessment results), which provides the results of SC18-requested 33    analyses to update SC17-MI-WP-01 to include multispecies implications, and updates results based on the 2022 skipjack assessment. The report presents the consequences for each stock and fishery of SC16-defined stock depletion levels (SB/SBF=0) consistent with specified historical conditions and stock risk levels (paragraphs 76-78 of the SC16 Outcomes Document). Projections were conducted under two recruitment alternatives for bigeye; one based on the “recent” stock-recruitment relationship (last 10 years) and one on long-term recruitment (over entire assessment).  Yellowfin projections were all based on long-term recruitment. Under baseline (2016-2018 average) fishing conditions, both bigeye (both recruitment alternatives) and yellowfin stocks were projected to increase relative to 2012-2015 average levels, and either remain at recent (2015-2018 average) levels (yellowfin) or increase (bigeye). Six SC-requested scenarios were considered for all three sets of projections; three were based on achieving a depletion level in 2048 equal to the 2012-2015 average (equal to and +/- 10% depletion). One scenario was to achieve 2048 depletion equal to the 2000-2004 average. Final SC16-specified depletion levels related to those equivalent to a 10% and 20% risk of falling below the LRP. Results for all three sets of projections are provided in tables in the report. Results provided included namely i) Change in SB/SBF=0 from 2012-2015 and recent (2015-2018) averages; ii) Risk = percentage of projections where SB/SBF=0 < LRP; iii) Multispecies impact (Equivalent depletion for other species, i.e., skipjack + bigeye/yellowfin + albacore); iv) Median equilibrium yield (% of MSY); and v) Relative YPR and SPR (to base fishing level). Equivalent depletion levels for South Pacific albacore were 5-10 percentage points below 2012-2015 average across all scenarios; equivalent skipjack depletion could be higher, lower, or equal to 2012-2015 depletion depending on scenario."
WCPFC19,154,"Australia on behalf of FFA members noted that the depletion levels for skipjack tuna have recently been updated at each of the specified TRPs for yellowfin and bigeye tuna following the adoption of the new 2022 skipjack assessment, yet SC18 was unable to provide further advice or recommendations to the Commission on TRPs for these two important tuna stocks.  The decision on TRPs for these stocks is critical and has major implications for the management of our fisheries. They stated that yellowfin and bigeye tuna are central stocks for FFA members, important in both purse seine and longline fisheries, and having a clear understanding of the trade-offs associated with potential TRPs is essential. Given that more time will be needed for the Commission to come to an agreement on TRPs for both yellowfin and bigeye tuna, FFA members recommended rescheduling the selection of TRPs for these two stocks, perhaps to 2024, while the Commission continues to develop the multi-species modelling framework and other work such as the consideration of candidate MPs for the tropical longline fisheries.  FFA members reiterated their commitment to progressing harvest strategy work and stated they look forward to progressing the discussions on developing suitable TRPs for yellowfin and bigeye."
WCPFC19,155,"The Chair noted the lack of agreement on the setting of TRP, asked stated that this should be taken into account when updating the workplan (addressed under Agenda Item 7.1)."
WCPFC19,156,WCPFC19 noted the report from the Scientific Services Provider on a target reference point for bigeye and yellowfin tuna (WCPFC19-2022-12).  WCPFC19 agreed on the need for further work prior to considering target reference points for bigeye and yellowfin tuna and noted that the Commission will continue to work on these issues in the coming years.   6.3 Review of CMM 2021-01 6.3.1 Evaluation and review of CMM 2021-01
WCPFC19,157,"The Chair noted that the relevant reference papers for this agenda item are working papers WCPFC19-2022-09 Reference Document for Bigeye, Yellowfin and Skipjack tuna for the Review of CMM 34    2021-01 and Development of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 and WCPFC19-2022-13_rev1 Evaluation of CMM 2021-01"
WCPFC19,158,"Dr. Paul Hamer (SPC-OFP) presented on the evaluation of CMM 2021-01 with reference to WCPFC19-2022-13_rev1. The presentation provided a brief background on the purpose and scope of the CMM 2021-01, the evaluation of which is required each year while it is in operation. This was followed by a description of the approach to conducting the evaluation, the main results and summary of the implications. The main updates to the evaluation were that results from new stock projections for skipjack using the 2022 assessment were included, and the latest data for year 2021 were added to Table 9 on the observed FAD set and longline catch scalars and the various tables in the appendices. The recent observed scalars for FAD sets and longline catches where less than the scalars predicted under the CMM based on the 2016-18 baseline period. The evaluation indicated that the CMM provisions, notably the FAD closures and longline catch limits, were consistent with meeting the interim stock status objectives noted in paras 11-13. It was noted that new stock assessments for yellowfin and bigeye will be conducted in 2023, and that CMM 2021-01 will expire in February 2024."
WCPFC19,159,"The EU posed four questions: (i) Purse seine effort and longline catch are expressed as scalars of the levels reported in 2016–2018. What is the rationale for not using real 2019–2021 information for this simulation instead of trying to predict what the fleet would have done relative to 2016-2018 conditions? The EU stated that it made sense when evaluating the measure some years ago, but now it is not clear. SPC stated that the provisions of the CMM came into effect in 2019; the scalars are relative to conditions that were in place prior to that. (ii) The EU stated that it did not understand the following comment in the last paragraph in section 5, and asked SPC to explain: “We also assume that the potential increase in purse seine fishing effort permissible under recently nominated EEZ effort levels will not occur, under the logic that we do not expect EEZs where purse seine effort has been less than 1500 days annually over recent years to attract additional effort”. SPC stated that as the EU implied, there is scope for effort to increase, and that one scenario that could be run would be with effort at maximum level for all limits. (iii) The EU stated that in Attachment 2 of CMM 2021-01, there is a limit of 2,282 days in the high seas (for CCMs with limits, excluding the Philippines), and the sum of days that actually took place in 2021 for limited CCMs shown in Table 13 is of 1,147 days. However, according to Table 14, row 10, it seems the number of sets reported in 2021 is higher than in both the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. The EU inquired whether that interpretation was correct? If so, how is that? The number of fishing days was half that predicted in the pessimistic scenario but the number of sets was significantly higher; is there an issue in reporting or has setting frequency increased? In reply SPC stated that the scalar of 1.06 is for the entire fishery. The high sea component is a very small component of the FAD sets, and changes in the days in the HS has very little effect.  (iv) Regarding the bottom row in Table 14 (the impact of removing the FAD sets from non-limited CCMs in the high seas), the EU stated its understanding that this estimation is based on 2016-2018 conditions, and inquired if this was correct, noting that if so, it would like to know how it compares with the real 2019-2021 data. SPC stated that recent rates (2019-2021) are used for the calculations."
WCPFC19,160,"Japan observed that WCPFC adopted the first tropical tuna CMM in 2008, with a series of subsequent renewals and modifications, and that SPC has provided multiple projections over this period, all of which show a declining stock status trend for bigeye, yellowfin, and skipjack, despite the series of TTMs that have been in place. Japan suggested one reason may be because the evaluations do not take effort creep of purse seine or other fisheries into account, and stated that its delegation had urged many times that effort creep be included. Japan stated its understanding that effort creep is not included in the projections discussed at WCPFC19. Japan stated that it is known that effort creep has occurred over time, and suggested that it could possibly be estimated based on past effort creep. Japan also suggested that possible factors other than effort creep could also be considered. SPC agreed that effort creep is a topic of interest, and stated it was addressed in the recent skipjack stock assessment. SPC stated that it lacks good estimates of effort creep to project into the future, and prefers to run effort creep scenarios on a strong information base. SPC stated it 35    has some measures planned to estimate effort creep, which would be discussed in SC. SPC stated that more work on this is needed, and emphasized it is reluctant to suggest that reliable of estimates of effort creep could be made based on existing data."
WCPFC19,161,"Cook Islands on behalf of FFA members thanked SPC for the ongoing and very useful analysis, stating it provides a clear update on the performance of the management actions in achieving the objectives set out for the current TTM in paragraphs 11-13, which are adequately achieving the management objective. They stated this would be very useful in preparations for the review of the TTM in 2023. They stated that while the CMM is adequately achieving its management objectives from a technical perspective, FFA members find that the distribution of benefits accrued from these fisheries are still very uneven. They stated that the coastal states who are stewards to most of the resources remain very dependent on these fisheries for economic growth and food security, but see the benefits skewed towards those outside the region, and seek a more equitable distribution the benefits, economically and socially in the near future."
WCPFC19,162,"New Zealand stated it supported the work by SPC to further examine the effort creep dynamics, and referenced its comments at SC18 that focussed on some concerns on model data conflicts, which included the concern that effort creep had not been taken into account adequately. New Zealand encouraged further work on this."
WCPFC19,163,RMI stated that in looking at a new TTM it was important to recognize the objectives of the current TTM are largely working. RMI supported the comments by Cook Islands. RMI also noted the need to support CCMs’ development aspirations.
WCPFC19,164,"Indonesia thanked SPC for the work and presentation, and stated that while the indication is that CMM 2021-01 would likely achieve its objectives as applied to the entire WCPFC Convention Area the situation in Region 5 situation was quite different, and asked whether there was any specific information regarding the likelihood of achieving the interim objectives in Region 5. SPC stated that the evaluations are structured around the objective of the CMM, which addresses the entire stock. An evaluation at a subregional scale requires determining how to structure the analysis. SPC noted that there are no objectives at the subregional scale, and stated if subregional evaluations were desired, it would have to consider how to do this."
WCPFC19,165,"Kiribati directed the Commission's attention to SC18-MI-IP-02, which examined effort creep in the purse seine fishery and found very little evidence of it based on the currently available data."
WCPFC19,166,"Nauru, on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau, noted that the update on the performance of the TTM shows that the measure is projected to continue to achieve its objectives, and stated that thanks to the TTM, tropical tuna stocks are healthy, and the major tropical fisheries are stable. They noted that the next step, as CCMs had agreed, is to put in place longer-term arrangements in the form of harvest strategies. They stated they look forward to the Commission taking a major step forward at this session by adopting a skipjack MP. However, they noted gaps and weaknesses in the current management framework, especially for management of fishing in the high seas, which is less well controlled and far less effectively monitored than fishing in national waters, and stated it would be difficult to fully apply longer-term management arrangements until the weakness in high seas management is addressed."
WCPFC19,167,"China stated its understanding that skipjack is more productive than other tuna and more sensitive to environmental impacts, as reflected in the stock assessments. China inquired whether the evaluation considers climate change, especially as relates to recruitment? SPC stated that the evaluations do not consider climate change or recruitment relationships; they reflect the status quo or long-term recruitment. 36"
WCPFC19,168,WCPFC19 noted with appreciation the report from the Scientific Services Provider on the evaluation and review of CMM 2021-01 (WCPFC19-2022-13_rev1).  Philippines letter to the Commission on VMS (WCPFC19-2022-DP16)
WCPFC19,169,The Philippines reviewed the issues raised in its delegation paper WCPFC19-2022-DP16 as introduced under Agenda Item 4.
WCPFC19,170,"During the ensuing discussion CCMs supported a 1-year extension of the replacement period for the ARGOS units, but stressed to the Philippines that it should ensure it either obtained Commission approval for the VMS 100Si or another unit prior to the expiration of the 1-year extension, as it would not be renewed."
WCPFC19,171,"WCPFC19 agreed to the request from the Philippines for a limited extension of no longer than 12 months for the replacement of ARGOS units covering only the support vessels that are operating in High Seas Pocket 1.  WCPFC19 indicated that no further extension would be agreed, and that Philippines needed to address the type approval of VMS 100Si.  6.3.1.1 Review of results from the FAD Management Options IWG"
WCPFC19,172,The Chair stated that the Commission would consider the aspects of the report of the FAD Management Options Intersessional Working Group (FADMO-IWG) that relate to the FAD provisions of CMM 2021-01.
WCPFC19,173,"The FADMO-IWG Chair, Jamel James (FSM) summarised the work of the IWG, referencing WCPFC19-2022-FADMgmtOptions Progress report of the FADMO-IWG on the preliminary review of available information on biodegradable FADS."
WCPFC19,174,"French Polynesia acknowledged and supported the important and necessary work on biodegradable FADs, but emphasised the need for effort by WCPFC and IATTC to strengthen effective management of FADs, including by addressing FAD monitoring, identification, and tracking, and appropriate limits on the number of FADs. French Polynesia also asked that WCPFC and IATTC work together to stop the stranding of FADs on French Polynesia’s shores, stating it was time to address these issues."
WCPFC19,175,"Tuvalu on behalf of FFA members acknowledged and thanked the FADMO-IWG Chair and participants for their work to date on addressing the issues of improving FAD development and management in the WCPO. FFA members reiterated their commitment to the work of the IWG and supported SC18’s recommendation that FADMO-IWG continue its work on assessing the best options for the use of “biodegradable FADs”. They noted that it is important to have a clear definition of “biodegradable FADs”, and a timeline and steps for their introduction FADs. They encouraged constructive engagements by CCMs in the IWG. FFA members also supported TCC18’s recommendation on revising the specifications in paragraph 17 of CMM 2021-01 to prohibit deploying FADs with mesh net after 1 January 2024. They noted the need to revisit the ROP minimum data fields related to the monitoring of non-entangling and biodegradable FAD implementation in the future, to improve related data quality, and stated their understanding that these would also be included in the work of the FADMO-IWG in 2023.  37"
WCPFC19,176,"  New Caledonia stated that FADs are tools used by purse seine fisheries, but that they should not become waste. New Caledonia stated that its EEZ contains remote reefs and islands that are highly protected, with thousands of seabirds, some of which are also protected. Abandoned FADs are found on these fully protected beaches, along with numerous buoys with batteries and electrical components. New Caledonia stated that this constitutes a type of pollution, and encouraged work to address both abandoned FADs and the issue of buoys."
WCPFC19,177,"Korea thanked the FADMO IWG for its work. It noted that IATTC and WCPFC are neighbouring RFMOs, and stated that it is important to ensure that CMMs adopted in those RFMOs are consistent and harmonised for vessels fishing in both convention areas. It supported the proposed use of the IATTC definition of biodegradable FADs, and supported the IWG recommendation."
WCPFC19,178,"The EU stated its understanding that COVID-19 did not allow the work of the FADMO-IWG to take place as expected, and expressed the hope that the pace of work could be accelerated. The EU noted that much scientific work was ongoing, and wanted to ensure that it was more thoroughly discussed at TCC and SC, and that the FADMO-IWG resume work in a more active manner in 2023. The EU stated it supported the proposed recommendation, but questioned whether this would take place at WCPFC19, or be delayed another year by being referred to the IWG. The Chair stated that this depended on how CCMs wished to proceed."
WCPFC19,179,"The USA thanked participants for continuing to progress work on FADs through the IWG, supported the recommendations made by SC and TCC, and Korea’s statement concerning the need for compatible FAD definitions between IATTC and WCPFC."
WCPFC19,180,French Polynesia supported the comment by the EU.
WCPFC19,181,WCPFC19 noted with appreciation the report of the Chair of the FAD Management Options IWG (WCPFC19-2022-FADMgmtOptions).
WCPFC19,182,"The Commission supported the SC18 and TCC18 recommendations for the IATTC definition of biodegradable and categories of biodegradable FADs. The Commission further noted that the FADMO-IWG will further examine the categories of biodegradable FADs, timeline for the stepwise introduction of biodegradable FADs, potential gaps and other relevant information."
WCPFC19,183,The Commission tasked the FADMO-IWG with assistance from the Secretariat and the Scientific Services Provider to review the effectiveness of paragraph 22 of CMM 2021-01 and other FAD related issues and incorporate into its 2023 work plan.  6.3.1.2 Baseline period or limit of the Indonesian Large Fish Handline Fishery
WCPFC19,184,"The Chair noted that WCPFC19 would consider the advice of SC18 and TCC18, and the information submitted by Indonesia, on the baseline period or limit for the Indonesian large fish handline fishery."
WCPFC19,185,"Indonesia introduced WCPFC19-2022-DP11 Options for a baseline of the ""Large-fish"" Handline Fishery fishing in Indonesia's EEZ (IEEZ) with vessels >30GT for the WCPFC Tropical Tuna Measure. It noted that the issue was previously considered by SC17 and SC18, and TCC17 and TCC18. SC18 noted the information provided by Indonesia related to options for a baseline of the “large- fish” handline fishery 38    fishing in Indonesia’s EEZ, and observed that the decision on the fishery’s baseline is a policy decision, and that it did not believe it appropriate to provide any recommendations on a baseline, but recommended the Commission consider the information provided in the relevant SC18 papers and the comments in the SC18 ODF on the topic in its decision making. TCC18 observed that the decision on the baseline period should be made by the Commission, and invited Indonesia to provide additional information to WCPFC19, which Indonesia stated it had sought to do in WCPFC19-2022-DP11."
WCPFC19,186,"The USA stated it appreciated submission of WCPFC19-2022-DP11 by Indonesia and that it understood the data challenges Indonesia faces. It noted that catch estimates were provided during 2013-2016, but that a transition to a new data collection system had subsequently prevented data submissions. The USA inquired whether Indonesia would provide additional data in the future?"
WCPFC19,187,"Fiji on behalf of FFA members noted that this was not the first time the Commission had discussed this proposal and stated FFA members had raised concerns before. They inquired: i) Why is the proposal limit based on the ‘highest catch’ (2015 catches) within the proposed period of 2013-2016 which does not take into consideration that there is a need to limit the expansion of effort and catches from this fishery, given the lack of proper monitoring and reporting?; and ii) What is the status of recent catches, from 2017 to 2021, for this fishery?. FFA members noted their concern with the large limit proposed and the inference that a CCM can simply pick the highest catch estimated as a limit without making efforts to constrain the fishery in the way other CCMs must do."
WCPFC19,188,"Japan stated that during discussion at TCC meetings on this issue many information gaps had been noted, and sought clarification regarding data availability. Japan also stated it had concerns because Indonesia was seeking to set its catch limit based on a single year, while other members are managed based on an average of 2001-2004. Japan stated it was unfair to other CCMs if Indonesia choose one good year as a reference year. Japan also addressed the lack of catch data for years other than 2013-2016, and stated its interest in seeing recent catch data for the handline fishery, noting the importance of having accurate data on which to make a decision on a baseline. It noted that paragraph 11 of WCPFC19-2022-DP11 states that prior to 2004 several companies conducted large fish handlining, and suggested that if it was correct, perhaps some accurate data should be obtainable from those several companies."
WCPFC19,189,"China inquired if Indonesia could provide catch by species, rather than grouped."
WCPFC19,190,"Tokelau on behalf of PNA and Tokelau noted that apart from the discussion on the level of this limit, there is the issue of how a skipjack MP will be applied to this fishery.  The current limit is an aggregate limit of bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin catches. The limits on other commercial fisheries are similar. They noted that some work will clearly be needed on how the skipjack MP outputs will be applied to these fisheries."
WCPFC19,191,The Chair encouraged Indonesia to consider CCMs’ comments when providing additional data.
WCPFC19,192,WCPFC19 noted the delegation paper submitted by Indonesia and the Scientific Services Provider on the Indonesian large fish handline fishery (WCPFC19-2022-DP11).  There was no agreement to adopt the recommendation in the paper and WCPFC19 noted that it would appreciate receiving further information from Indonesia in response to questions raised at WCPFC19.  39    6.3.1.3 Process to negotiate a new or revised Tropical Tuna Measure
WCPFC19,193,"The Chair stated that there was a need for the Commission to determine a process to negotiate a new or revised TTM, as the current CMM expires on 15 February 2024. She stated that previous TTM negotiations had involved special several meetings: in 2021, there were two workshops chaired by the Commission Chair to discuss the revised measure (the current CMM 2021-01); in 2017, there were two intersessional sessions of the WCPFC to progress negotiations on a new TTM."
WCPFC19,194,"Niue on behalf of FFA members stated that in WCPFC19-2022-DP03 (introduced under Agenda Item 4), FFA members sought WCPFC’s commitment to a more focused process to work on the TTM in 2023 that prioritizes the issue of an overarching hard limit for purse seine effort on the high seas and a framework for the allocation of that limit. FFA members stressed that the TTM provides the critical implementing framework for the skipjack MP. Establishing an overall limit for high seas purse seine effort is critical to ensure the effective implementation of the MP and FFA members stated they see this as the most critical issue for resolution in 2023. Agreement of an allocation framework would also eliminate the need to rely on an exemption to protect the rights and interests of SIDS and territories to participate in the high seas purse seine fishery."
WCPFC19,195,"The USA stated it was open to a discussion on the best approach to developing the TTM, and that it would prefer a complete discussion that covers all components, including purse seine and longline, and suggested the need for a workplan."
WCPFC19,196,"RMI stated that the TTM largely achieved the desired objectives and outcome; while some adjustments might be needed, it suggested using the current TTM as a basis, as it largely works for all CCMs. Issues to address could then be identified. RMI stressed the need for early communication, and noted without it the discussion in 2023 would be very difficult. RMI also stressed the importance of CMM 2013-06 in that respect. It stated it looked forward to a new CMM that largely captures the elements of the current TTM and adjusts as needed in a way that is acceptable to all."
WCPFC19,197,"Chinese Taipei stated that there are many elements to be addressed, and supported a focus on all elements. It supported the comment made by the USA, as well as that by RMI, and noted the need to rebalance the components in the CMM."
WCPFC19,198,"The EU stated that the CMM will expire, so all elements of it needed to be discussed. It referenced linkages between the approach to the WCPFC19 discussions on an MP for skipjack and the approach to drafting and adopting a TTM. It suggested that it might be necessary to wait until the discussion of the skipjack MP had progressed before discussing how to address the TTM in 2023."
WCPFC19,199,"The Chair stated that the mandates in CMM 2021-01 are clear. She agreed that there are links between a skipjack MP (which she stated she hoped would be agreed to at WCPFC19) and the TTM to be agreed to in 2023, and stated she wanted to focus on the process for adopting a TTM, not the details of the content."
WCPFC19,200,"Japan noted the opinions expressed by the USA and Chinese Taipei, and reflected that in the past discussions on the issue had carefully considered the balance between regions and fisheries (longline and purse seine), and suggested this would be a good approach to use."
WCPFC19,201,"Korea stated that the Commission previously used workshops dedicated to discussion of the TTM, and suggested a similar approach be used in 2023. It noted that there would be a need for updated information from SC, and suggested holding two workshops, one before SC19 and one after. 40"
WCPFC19,202,"RMI expressed concern that there would many meetings in 2023, and advocated minimizing the number of meetings while still being effective."
WCPFC19,203,The Chair noted that there was agreement on using the current CMM as a basis. She proposed a draft workplan on the basis of holding two workshops.
WCPFC19,204,"In the ensuing discussion CCMs raised a number of issues, including timing and potential conflicts with other meetings, the advantages and disadvantages of electronic and in-person meetings, the potential for CCMs to engage outside the Commission process (e.g., through workshops such as that as referenced in WCPFC19-2022-DP17, as well as bilaterally), the importance of addressing South Pacific albacore as well as bigeye and yellowfin, and the mechanisms for requesting additional scientific analysis by the Scientific Services Provider (SPC). Several CCMs voiced support for holding an initial virtual meeting in the first quarter of the year."
WCPFC19,205,"In summary the Chair noted the statement by FFA members that the TTM work focus on hard limits for purse seine fisheries, and the indication by CCMs for the need to also address longline limits and allocation issues. She noted the Commission Chair and Secretariat would take due consideration of timing issues in finalizing the arrangements, and stated that minor revisions in the approach might be made in 2023 at the discretion of the new Commission Chair."
WCPFC19,206,"WCPFC19 agreed on a Process to Negotiate a Revised Tropical Tuna Measure in 2023, with revisions to the time frames in the work plan to be made at the discretion of the new Chair of the Commission in consultation with CCMs and taking into account other RFMO meetings attended by CCMs. (Attachment H)  6.4 South Pacific Albacore"
WCPFC19,207,"The Chair noted WCPFC19-2022-14 Reference document for South Pacific albacore for the review of CMM 2015-02 and development of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06, which contains the various relevant recommendations and decisions of SC18, TCC18 and the South Pacific albacore Roadmap IWG (SPALB_RM-IWG) to the issues to be discussed under Agenda Item 6.4. 6.4.1 Harvest strategy issues 6.4.1.1 Review of any additional performance indicators, if available, and alternative target reference points"
WCPFC19,208,"Dr. Graham Pilling (SPC-OFP) presented WCPFC19-2022-15. Further analyses to inform discussions on South Pacific albacore objectives and the TRP. Discussions at WCPFC18 on the recalibrated TRP for this stock made it clear that the necessary catch reductions were not acceptable to managers. The Chair of the SPALB_RM-IWG requested further analyses to help inform discussion and clarify manager’s objectives for the fishery, and this paper presents the stock and fishery outcomes of different potential future changes in longline and troll catches (WCPFC Convention Area or South Pacific-wide) to highlight trade-offs between objectives involved in alternative ‘candidate TRP’ levels. If longline and troll fisheries catch is maintained at 2017-2019 average levels (~72,200 mt in the WCPFC Convention Area and 15,600 mt in the remaining EPO), longline vulnerable biomass the catch rate proxy will decline relative to all benchmarks examined: the current management objective of 2013 vulnerable biomass levels + 8%, 2013 levels, and the 2017-2019 average level. Risk of falling below the LRP increased to 22%, and stock depletion would be around 43% of SBF=0 in the WPCFC CA. To maintain vulnerable biomass at recent levels, or to achieve 41    increases, catch reductions would be required. The level of those reductions depended on the level of CPUE increase desired. The level of catch reduction also depended upon whether they were taken in the WCPFC Convention Area alone, or across the South Pacific. The degree of impact of catch reductions by 10% to 50% relative to recent (2017-2019 average levels) on stock depletion, risk and CPUE are presented in the paper."
WCPFC19,209,"Cook Islands on behalf of FFA members thanked SPC for their work on this issue and noted that the effective management of the southern longline fishery is of high importance to all CCMs targeting South Pacific albacore, and therefore must apply over the whole range of the stock (WCPFC Convention Area and EPO). FFA members stated they are committed to progressing the improved management of this key fishery through the harvest strategy approach and the implementation of zone-based management. FFA members reiterated the need to review the management objectives for this important stock, given that the recalibrated interim TRP required to achieve the current objective is untenable, and stated they would work with all CCMs through the SPALB_RM-IWG in order to bring a revised management objective and TRP to the Commission in 2023."
WCPFC19,210," New Caledonia stated that for over 5 years it and other members have noted the South Pacific albacore fishery is economically unsustainable. It noted that the lack of progress to address this, and the need to develop an allocation that benefits SIDS and dependent territories. It noted the impacts of COVID-19 on the ability of the Commission to progress the issue, and on communities and fisheries. New Caledonia stressed that the tuna market had been impacted, while all fishery costs increased, but not tuna prices. New Caledonia stated that although their fishery was small fishery “it is our fishery”. It supported a review of the management objectives, including the interim TRP."
WCPFC19,211,"French Polynesia strongly supported the statement by New Caledonia, noting it is very important to consider the entire Pacific stock (including the WCPO and EPO) when considering impacts, and stressed the importance of the fishery."
WCPFC19,212,WCPFC19 noted with appreciation the analyses undertaken by the Scientific Services Provider to inform discussions on South Pacific albacore objectives and the target reference point (WCPFC19-2022-15).  6.4.1.2 Review of additional work tasked by the SMD01 to support decision-making on management procedures.
WCPFC19,213,"Dr Rob Scott (SPC) provided a presentation on WCPFC19-2022-16 Updates on management procedure evaluations for SP albacore since SMD01 to summarise the discussions of SC18 and SMD01 on the development of management procedures for South Pacific albacore. To support discussions on management objectives for South Pacific albacore, a range of catch reduction scenarios were presented to SC18. From these options several CCMs identified catch reductions of 10% and 20% from recent (2017-2019) levels for further consideration. SC18 requested additional analyses to determine the impact of including or excluding the EPO fisheries from control by the management procedure. SMD01 further discussed the issue with respect to the troll fishery and requested a similar analysis to determine the impact of including or excluding the troll fishery from the control of the management procedure. The results of these analyses indicated that: i) if measures do not apply to the EPO an additional 2%-3% catch reduction is required in WCPFC Convention Area longline and troll fisheries to achieve the same stock depletion outcome (approximately 1500-2000 mt less WCPFC Convention Area catch in these two scenarios); ii) if measures do not apply to the WCPFC Convention Area troll fishery an additional 0-1% catch reduction in WCPFC Convention Area longline and EPO fisheries to achieve the same stock depletion outcome approx. 0 –750 mt less catch); and iii) if measures do not apply to either EPO fisheries or the WCPFC 42    Convention Area troll fishery an additional 3-4% catch reduction is required in WCPFC Convention Area longline fishery (approximately 2000 to 3000 mt less). It was noted that more recent catch estimates for the EPO (presented in WCPFC19-2022-IP06, Figure 1) indicate higher catches for 2021 than have been assumed in the analysis (approximately 45% higher than the 2017-2019 average EPO catch). In addition, the analysis assumed that catch reductions in the WCPFC Convention Area can be achieved without vessels moving across into the EPO and continuing to fish for South Pacific albacore, resulting in a spatial redistribution of albacore catches rather than a net reduction in overall catch."
WCPFC19,214,"Samoa on behalf of FFA members emphasised the need for agreement on a revised management objective and an associated TRP for the fishery to support the continued development of the South Pacific albacore MP and to take into account SPC-OFP’s updated analysis based on the additional work tasked by SMD01. They noted that in its update SPC-OFP recommended securing compatible management in the EPO, and consider this an important element in managing the stock throughout its range, but queried how the Commission might achieve this. As such, FFA members proposed that the SPALB_RM-IWG be tasked to explore this matter and report back to WCPFC20. FFA members proposed that SPC-OFP continues to progress the development of the South Pacific albacore MP that makes provision for EPO catch, but suggested that the South Pacific albacore HCR would be applicable to the management of South Pacific albacore within the WCPFC Convention Area only."
WCPFC19,215,"The USA stated that it supported distinct MPs for longline and troll fisheries, and commented that because WCPFC can only affect management in the WCPFC Convention Area, it should do its analysis without attempting to estimate or anticipate impacts in the IATTC convention area."
WCPFC19,216,"New Zealand noted the relatively stable catch of South Pacific albacore through the troll fishery, and the relatively minor impact on the stock.  It stated that the troll fishery and longline fisheries for South Pacific albacore have different characteristics. In order to explore the implications of treating troll differently, at SMD01 New Zealand requested that SPC-OFP analyse the impact on the status of South Pacific albacore of either including or excluding troll fishing in the proposed MP. New Zealand stated its understanding that excluding the troll fishery would require a minor (1% at most) reduction in catch by the South Pacific albacore longline fishery in both the WCPFC and IATTC CAs. New Zealand stated that the bigger question relates to the inclusion or exclusion of the EPO, which is of far greater magnitude to the core question of improving the management of South Pacific albacore than the question of whether troll should be included or excluded. New Zealand stated the need to consider whether a common management approach should be applied across the entire South Pacific Ocean (for example both WCPFC and IATTC areas). It advocated that this would make sense for effective management of the South Pacific albacore stock as a whole, and to ensure that effort does not move to an uncontrolled EPO, stating it is notable that catches in EPO were 45% higher in 2021 compared to the 2017-2019 average levels. New Zealand stated that there are practical issues as to how to implement common management, and these would need to be worked through in the SPALB_RM-IWG during 2023. New Zealand stated that its position on these matters was still being worked through, and that it looked forward to focusing on these issues in the SPALB_RM-IWG in 2023."
WCPFC19,217,"China stated that regarding whether necessary to include the troll fishery, it would be difficult for China to suggest to its longline fishery that a reduction was needed if all fisheries were not included. China suggested the need to work intersessionally with other CCMs to find a solution. Regarding the EPO, China stated that it tabled a proposal at IATTC to freeze the number of vessels fishing for South Pacific albacore, but stated that IATTC has different types of measures, and indicated that there is no current basis for IATTC to take concrete action of this type. China stated that WCPFC should not wait for another RFMO before taking action. 43"
WCPFC19,218,New Caledonia thanked New Zealand for highlighting a number of issues that needed to be addressed in adopting MPs for South Pacific albacore.
WCPFC19,219,"Chinese Taipei noted the importance of the fishery. Regarding the management procedures, it noted that there may be difficulties if the focus is solely on the WCPO in the form of significant impacts on the conservation of the stock in future. It urged the Commission to work with IATTC. It stated that all fisheries taking South Pacific albacore should be included to ensure fairness, as otherwise some fisheries would effectively be punished. Chinese Taipei committed to working with the Chair of the SPALB_RM-IWG and all CCMs to get results."
WCPFC19,220,French Polynesia strongly supported New Zealand’s comments.
WCPFC19,221,"The Chair noted the differing views on a joint approach with IATTC, and the broad agreement that it was important to cover all fisheries."
WCPFC19,222,WCPFC19 noted the additional work tasked by SMD01 to support decision-making on management procedures for South Pacific albacore (WCPFC19-2022-16).   6.4.2 Review of CMM 2015-02 6.4.2.1 Review of the SPA Roadmap-IWG activities
WCPFC19,223,"Ms Neomai Ravitu (Fiji), Chair of the SPALB_RM-IWG, presented a summary of the work of the IWG, with reference to WCPFC-SPALB_RM-2022-00 Chair's Report of the SPALB Roadmap IWG Progress, dated 19 August 2022."
WCPFC19,224,"New Caledonia stated that regarding South Pacific Albacore additional issues had been raised and should be addressed, and suggest the frequency of the roadmap meetings be increased in 2023."
WCPFC19,225,"The USA stated it appreciated the robust discussion at the meeting held at WPCFC19, and noted it looked forward to additional questions. It stated it was happy to see efforts to strengthen the focus on climate change by including climate change in the latest draft TOR."
WCPFC19,226,"China thanked the IWG chair for her excellent leadership, and stated that a change of direction was sought which might require the involvement of the Scientific Services Provider. China suggested developing a workplan to guide work of the IWG."
WCPFC19,227,WCPFC noted with appreciation the Report of the Chair of the SPA Roadmap-IWG (WCPFC19-2022-SPALB_RM).
WCPFC19,228,WCPFC19 adopted the terms of reference and work plan for the SPA Roadmap-IWG (Attachment I).  6.5 North Pacific Albacore 6.5.1 Review of CMM 2019-03
WCPFC19,229,No issues were considered under this agenda item.  44    6.5.2 Harvest Strategy proposal from NC18
WCPFC19,230,"The Chair noted that the Harvest Strategy for North Pacific Albacore, contained in WCPFC19-2022-17, Attachment A, was introduced under Agenda Item 4, and welcomed comments on the proposal."
WCPFC19,231,"Kiribati on behalf of FFA members thanked the NC for the proposal and stated they were generally supportive of having a harvest strategy for North Pacific albacore in the WCPO, but sought clarification on several questions, noting that the answers would help FFA members better understand the merits of the proposed harvest strategy. The questions were as follow: (i) What justification is there for selecting the time period 2006-2015 in management objective 1(b)? The NC Chair stated the time period was selected because the CMM for North Pacific albacore had proven effective at maintaining fishing effort, and was slated to remain at that level for 10 years. (ii) Why is an LRP of 14% proposed when the WCPFC has adopted a biomass-based LRP of 20% for its four key tuna species, and this was also used in the North Pacific albacore tuna stock assessment done in 2020. The NC Chair stated that 20% is used as a proxy when there is no estimate of MSY, while 14% is the best estimate for this stock. (iii) Why is a conceptual diagram of an HCR provided in the proposed harvest strategy rather than an HCR equation? The NC Chair stated that NC hoped to provide an HCR equation to the Commission in 2023. (iv) What is the area of application for the proposed Harvest Strategy? The NC Chair did not provide an answer. (v) Has an MSE been undertaken to help evaluate the performance of the proposed HCR specifically for the WCPO? If so, can the Commission be provided with the results of this evaluation to help in assessing the performance of the HCR and proposed harvest strategy against the management objectives? The NC Chair stated that an MSE was undertaken in 2018 or 2019 and was reported to SC and the Commission at that time."
WCPFC19,232,WCPFC19 adopted the HS-2022-01 Harvest Strategy for North Pacific Albacore presented by the Northern Committee (Attachment J).  6.6 Pacific Bluefin Tuna 6.6.1 Review of CMM 2021-02
WCPFC19,233,"Korea stated that it appreciated the comments provided at the NC17 meeting regarding Korea’s views on bluefin tuna, and looked forward to further discussions with CCMs in 2023. Korea also gave a brief introduction to its delegation paper regarding purse seine bluefin tuna bycatch in set net fisheries in Korean territorial waters (WCPFC19-2022-DP12 Information Paper on the Bycatch of Pacific Bluefin Tuna in Set Net Fisheries in its Territorial Waters)."
WCPFC19,234,"WCPFC19 noted WCPFC19-2022-DP12 presented by Korea and that Korea would bring a proposal on Pacific bluefin CMM to the Joint NC/IATTC Working Group, NC19 and WCPFC20 in 2023.  6.7 North Pacific Swordfish 6.7.1 Proposal from NC18"
WCPFC19,235,"The Chair noted that the NC’s proposed CMM for North Pacific Swordfish, contained in WCPFC19-2022-17, Attachment B, was introduced under Agenda Item 4, and welcomed comments on the proposal.  45"
WCPFC19,236,"The USA stated it supported adoption of the proposal. It further stated that the Commission should consider how to manage swordfish across the entire range of the stock, and suggested considering how to revise the proposal at NC19 with that in mind."
WCPFC19,237,"RMI, on behalf of FFA members, stated that FFA members supported the need for a CMM to restrict fishing effort on North Pacific swordfish stocks, and noted that the EPO swordfish stock has recently experienced overfishing relative to MSY-based reference points. FFA members referenced their proposed revised CMM to strengthen the existing measure for Southwest Pacific swordfish (CMM 2009-03) in WCPFC19-2022-DP07, stating that the current CMM contains no restrictions on fishing mortality in the high seas area north of 20°S. The CMM’s flag-based limits south of 20°S in combination with unconstrained catches north of 20°S may be too high to prevent future overfishing. Adding to these concerns is the uncertainty in the stock boundary between WCNPO stock and EPO stock. FFA members noted that the ability of the proposed CMM to achieve its objectives would be highly dependent on the effectiveness of using 2008-2010 average annual levels to restrict both the overall fishing effort and that of each fishery that takes swordfish in the high seas and EEZs, within the WCPFC Convention Area north of 20° N. To that end, FFA members asked the NC to clarify the term “fisheries taking North Pacific swordfish” used in the NC’s proposed CMM, and asked if this refers to all fisheries that record over 200 tonnes of North Pacific swordfish catch per year? In addition, they inquired how fishing effort is defined in these fisheries and what independent verification is available for those effort limits? They noted the absence of supporting data regarding how effective the 2008-2010 average annual levels would be in restricting fishing effort, and stated they looked forward to engaging with other CCMs to determine this, and suggested it be based on the best available science. Finally, FFA members stated their full support for the provision that exempts SIDS from the measure and thanked the NC for including that in the draft CMM."
WCPFC19,238,"The NC Chair stated the CMM would apply only north of 20°N, but that the Commission was concerned about the entire migration area of the stock; he stated he hoped that supplementary measures to cover whole range could be adopted in the near future, and that a complementary CMM for the stock in the southern area could be adopted. He stated that the CMM would apply to both EEZs and the high seas, and would exclude SIDS."
WCPFC19,239,"The EU stated it agreed with concerns expressed by RMI in terms of the east and west portions of the northern stock, and stated it was unclear what metric was used for various fisheries. The EU noted RMI’s comment that there is merit in clarifying the fisheries to which these restrictions would apply, and stated the need to distinguish between target and bycatch fisheries. The EU stated that there would be value in amending the proposal to include catch limits for target fisheries as is done for Southwest Pacific swordfish."
WCPFC19,240,"The NC Chair stated that their proposal would constitute the first CMM for this stock, noting that such a CMM had been discussed repeatedly but never enacted. The NC Chair stated that the CMM would simply serve to freeze fishing effort, and could be revised over time. He stated that NC was looking at all fishing activities that catch swordfish, including small-scale fishing activities, and would report back to WCPFC20 regarding the CMM’s effectiveness."
WCPFC19,241,"Following further consultations with the EU, the NC Chair stated that the EU had concerns with the preamble, and an issue to clarify the main body, but that the substance of the CMM would not be affected by the EU’s suggested changes. In view of the serious time constraints faced at WCPFC19, and resulting challenges in convening an NC meeting, the NC Chair suggest that these changes would be made at NC19 (in July 2023). With that understanding he asked the EU’s indulgence to approve the CMM as proposed, with the modifications to be made at NC19. The EU agreed with the NC Chair’s proposal, in light of the time constraints. 46"
WCPFC19,242,The Chair congratulated the NC and the Commission for approving the WCPFC’s first CMM for North Pacific swordfish.
WCPFC19,243,WCPFC19 adopted CMM 2022-02 Conservation and Management Measure for North Pacific Swordfish presented by the Northern Committee. (Attachment K)  6.8   Southwest Pacific Swordfish 6.8.1 Review of Southwest Pacific swordfish fishery
WCPFC19,244,There was no discussion under this agenda item.  6.8.2 Review of CMM 2009-03
WCPFC19,245,"The Chair stated that Australia, on behalf of FFA members, introduced WCPFC19-2022-DP07 Proposal for a CMM for Southwest Pacific swordfish under Agenda Item 4."
WCPFC19,246,"New Zealand on behalf of FFA members stated they are committed to developing a strengthened CMM for Southwest Pacific swordfish; noting the latest fisheries information, data, and science, they proposed a strengthened CMM, highlighting: zone-based management, compatible management and limits for the high seas, the sovereign rights of coastal states, and special requirements of SIDS and participating territories. They stated that the current CMM for Southwest Pacific swordfish contains no restrictions on fishing mortality in the high seas area north of 20°S and contains flag-based limits south of 20°S; the flag-based limits combined with unconstrained catches north of 20°S may be too high to prevent future overfishing. FFA members noted the healthy stock status of Southwest Pacific swordfish, and stated that the proposed measure does not seek to reduce recent catch levels. FFA members stated that they are seeking to implement a CMM that maintains biomass depletion at recent levels to maintain the health of the stock and provide development opportunities for SIDS. FFA members stated that they look forward to a constructive dialogue with other CCMs on this strengthened CMM for Southwest Pacific swordfish, and reiterated that uncertainty should not be a reason to avoid protective action and management of the stock. FFA members, led by Australia, offered to engage bilaterally or engage in a small working group to progress the measure for adoption at WCPFC19."
WCPFC19,247,"Korea supported the idea of expanding the geographic scope of application, noting that considerable catch takes place from 0° to 20°S. They stated that the most recent stock assessment indicates that Southwest Pacific swordfish is not overfished or subject to overfishing. It noted that catch over the prior 3 years had been low (as referenced in WCPFC19-2022-IP08), and that in light of this some parts of the proposal are excessively restrictive; they highlighted in particular zone-based management, stating it may constrain fishing operations in the high seas more than needed, if the purpose is to enable development of CCM fisheries. They noted that the CMM proposes a ban on light stocks and squid bait for longline fisheries taking Southwest Pacific swordfish as bycatch, and inquired regarding the impact on the catch rate of target species such as bigeye and yellowfin. Korea also inquired whether there had been any analysis of these issues, and whether SPC had any insights."
WCPFC19,248,"The EU concurred regarding the healthy status of the stock, and the need to expand the scope of the current CMM to include all catch south of the equator. It stated that a range of other elements in the CMM go beyond this, which makes the conversation more difficult. The EU stated that it would be happy to discuss how to achieve the common objective to ensure that all components of fishing mortality are covered by the CMM. 47"
WCPFC19,249,"Solomon Islands on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau recognized the substantial time and effort that had been put in by Australia to develop the proposal to the stage where it could be considered at WCPFC19. They noted that the approach taken by Australia was exemplary for engaging SIDS in the development of a CMM that encompasses the special requirements of SIDS and participating territories, recognizes zone-based management, and looks to develop compatible management and limits for the high seas. The PNA and Tokelau stated their support for the FFA proposal to revise and strengthen CMM 2009-03."
WCPFC19,250,"Chinese Taipei noted the stock status had improved, and stated it saw no provision in the current CMM that would prevent SIDS from developing their fisheries. It stated it did not see the need to take stronger measures and had raised these issues bilaterally."
WCPFC19,251,"China stated it had already expressed its concerns to the proponents. It also proposed using different years for setting the TAC, as the catch in period proposed was very low. China encouraged the delegations attending WCPFC19 in person to reach an agreement."
WCPFC19,252,"Tonga on behalf of FFA members stated that managing fisheries is not just about avoiding overfished stocks, it is also about achieving other objectives including in this case, economic viability, and maintaining development opportunities for SIDS. They stated that this approach had been pursued in other CMMs and associated processes including for tropical tunas and albacore. They stated that while the measure is not a harvest strategy, there is no reason it can’t seek to achieve similar outcomes and emphasised that stock sustainability is only one (albeit a very important) consideration."
WCPFC19,253,"French Polynesia stated that this was a very important step that is needed, and constituted an improvement, and stated it would work with other CCMs on it."
WCPFC19,254,"Australia supported the comments of its FFA colleagues, and stated it was encouraged by the healthy status of the stock. It stated it was important to act when a stock is healthy and not in trouble. Regarding the TAC, it stated it was based on projection work undertaken by SPC that looks at biomass depletion at recent catch levels. Australia acknowledged the issue raised by China. It stated the desire to develop a new CMM that has appropriate elements and includes development opportunities."
WCPFC19,255,"China indicated the issue should be considered by SC, noting that a projection from SPC was not equivalent to a recommendation from SC. Australia stated that determination of TRPs and management objectives was within the purview of the Commission, supported by scientific advice, and stated its view that the issue of consideration by SC had been fulfilled."
WCPFC19,256,"Following further negotiations in the SWG, and regarding the proposed recommendations, the EU stated that it could support the conclusion to extend management to the entire area south of the equator, and thanked CCMs for their hard work on the issue. It stated that CCMs had identified an area of common interest and committed to working on it further intersessionally."
WCPFC19,257,"Australia thanked CCMs for their engagement at WCPFC19, both bilaterally and in the SWG, on FFA’s proposal to strengthen the management of Southwest Pacific swordfish. It stated that while it is clear that all CCMs share the view that some form of management needs to cover the full range of the stock, to the equator in the WCPFC Convention Area, there was no consensus on how to achieve this. Australia stated its disappointment that the Commission would be unable to adopt a revised CMM at WCPFC19, while acknowledging the constructive engagement from a number of CCMs, in particular Japan, China and the USA, in putting forward views on limits and other aspects of the CMM that would contribute to an effective management measure for this stock. Australia noted that it had stated for some years that the existing CMM is not effective in that it does not prevent increases in mortality that would result in depletion of this stock in a manner that would impact sustainability, the viability of fisheries that fish for swordfish, and the rights and interests of coastal States, especially SIDS, to develop their aspirations for this fishery. It stated that 48    simply extending existing management arrangements to the full range of the stock would not address these fundamental flaws. It stated it recognises that the stock is in good shape and stated its desire to keep it that way – the idea that action should only be taken when a stock is in trouble is contrary to good fisheries management. Similarly, Australia noted that the current CMM, which could facilitate unconstrained fishing for swordfish, does not protect SIDS interests. Australia stated it worked closely with SIDS and territories over several years to develop a proposal that would genuinely protect SIDS interests, as articulated in a thorough and meaningful CMM 2013-06 assessment. It noted that as an FFA proposal, the proposal represented the collective views of 15 of the Commission’s SIDS and Territories, and Australia also welcomed the strong support of French Polynesia and New Caledonia for this work. Australia called on CCMs to carefully consider how CCMs could achieve the shared goal of extending management to encompass catches across the full range of the stock in the WCPFC Convention Area, while achieving the critical goals of achieving biological and economic objectives and protecting the interests and aspirations of SIDS and territories."
WCPFC19,258,"New Zealand and Cook Islands voiced disappointment that no further progress would be made at WCPFC19, and expressed the hope that the issues could be addressed and resolved in 2023."
WCPFC19,259,"The EU stated it engaged in the process and offered a range of comments and suggestions that it hoped were constructive. It noted that Southwest Pacific swordfish stocks were healthy and stated that the existing CMM had helped in that regard. It stated that there was insufficient time to negotiate the many elements that were proposed (allocating a TAC, and zone vs. flag-based limits)."
WCPFC19,260,"Niue supported the work and shared the concerns of other CCMs, and their disappointment that the proposal did not pass, noting that the fishery is not adequately managed to ensure sustainability."
WCPFC19,261,"The EU reiterated its view that the current measure does not prevent any CCMs from developing a fishery for these stocks. In response the Cook Islands rejected the position held by the EU, and stated that unrestricted fishing did not provide opportunities for SIDS, as an unrestricted fishery was not sustainable."
WCPFC19,262,"WCPFC agreed that progress should be made in 2023 on ensuring Southwest Pacific swordfish management extends beyond South of 20o S, to the entire Southwest Pacific swordfish stock in the WCPFC convention area, south of the equator."
WCPFC19,263,WCPFC noted that the SWG could not reach consensus on any other substantive matter regarding the proposed measure.  6.9 North Pacific Striped Marlin 6.9.1 Review of CMM 2010-01
WCPFC19,264,The Chair noted that the stock was addressed by the ISC in its presentation under Agenda Item 6.1.
WCPFC19,265,"The EU stated it wished to record its concern that the review of CMM 2010-01 could not be addressed given the lack of scientific advice, and stated it hoped that ISC could provide the information needed to develop a rebuilding plan for the stock in 2023."
WCPFC19,266,"FSM on behalf of FFA members noted with disappointment the delays in achieving conservation and management advice for North Pacific striped marlin, and that they had repeated this concern for many years. They stated they looked forward to the complete benchmark assessment to progress a CMM, and looked forward to contributing to discussions on appropriate and mutually agreed measures that will achieve 49    the rebuilding target of the stock. They stated that in the meantime, given the urgent need for stronger measures to reduce fishing mortality, alternative measures, such as non-retention, were urgently needed to reduce targeting of striped marlin in the North Pacific, and observed that this would be consistent with the Commission’s approach towards similarly depleted stocks such as oceanic whitetip and silky sharks."
WCPFC19,267,WCPFC19 noted that a proposed CMM on North Pacific striped marlin was deferred until 2023 and expressed concern regarding the continued delay in the rebuilding plans for the stock.   AGENDA ITEM 7  — HARVEST STRATEGY WORKPLAN
WCPFC19,268,"The Chair referenced WCPFC19-2022-DP06 Proposed Amendment to CMM 2014-06 on Establishing a Harvest Strategy for Key Fisheries and Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, which was introduced under Agenda Item 4."
WCPFC19,269,Cook Islands stated on behalf of FFA members that no proposals for amendments to the proposed amendment to CMM 2014-06 had been received during WCPFC19.
WCPFC19,270,WCPFC19 adopted CMM 2022-03 Conservation and Management Measure on Establishing a Harvest Strategy for key fisheries and stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Attachment L)  7.1 Review of Indicative Work Plan
WCPFC19,271,"The Chair introduced the agenda item, noting the need to review and update the Harvest Strategy Work Plan (HSWP) to reflect the progress achieved to date and to agree on timelines for future milestones. The Chair stated that Australia had previously taken the lead to coordinate updates to the work plan and stated that CCMs in the Heads of Delegations meeting prior to WCPFC19 had requested that Australia continue in that role."
WCPFC19,272,"Dr. James Larcombe (Australia) referenced WCPFC19-2022-19 Reference Document on the progress of the Harvest Strategy Workplan under CMM 2014-06. He reviewed the purpose of the HSWP, noting it is a high-level plan and focussed on the six elements of the harvest strategy as contained within the CMM. He stated it is ambitious, and updated annually. He noted the extensive work done by the Commission, SC and SPC toward the harvest strategy, and stated that a good summary of the progress to date was contained in the papers prepared for SMD01 (https://meetings.wcpfc.int/meetings/smd01). Updates to the HSWP since 2021 have been based on interventions from CCMs and discussions with SPC. He stated that the plan had been extended for 2 years to 2026, noting that this is important for several reasons, including to make clear to possible future funders that much work remains. He noted that SPC’s work on the harvest strategy had been funded in large part by New Zealand, as well as other funders, including the EU, and that further funding would be required. Regarding pending decisions, he observed that a CMM for skipjack was under discussion at WCPFC19, and the HSWP would reflect the outcomes. Regarding South Pacific albacore, a candidate MP was not ready in 2022, and this was discussed at SMD01. He stated that the discussions from the SPALB_RM-IWG at WCPFC19 would be reflected in the plan. For bigeye and yellowfin, he stated it was likely the operating models would require redevelopment following the stock assessment peer review process (ongoing during WCPFC19), which would affect the 2023 stock assessments and likely the design of the operating models. He noted that the multi-species development 50    work is also ongoing. He observed he had rescheduled agreement on bigeye and yellowfin TRPs to 2024, and tentatively scheduled bigeye and yellowfin MPs for 2026. He highlighted the staggered nature of the activities, first skipjack, then albacore, then bigeye and yellowfin which he noted is important for SPC to be able to service the activities, and for the CCMs to be able to address issues one at a time, and that this approach was the intent from the outset. He stated that the HSWP would be updated following discussions at WCPFC19."
WCPFC19,273,"Japan thanked Australia for its work, and observed that the discussion on the bigeye and yellowfin TRP was originally scheduled for 2022, and the discussion on the MP(s) for 2023; the proposed workplan delays the TRP discussion for these species to 2024, and the MP discussions to 2026. Japan observed that this was a significant delay, and proposed scheduling the yellowfin and bigeye MP discussions for 2025. Dr Larcombe responded that these dates were tentative, but that experience suggested the process takes longer than it would first appear. He noted that there was some technical work that has to happen over the next 2 years, but stated that it was potentially feasible to schedule MP adoption for yellowfin and bigeye in 2025."
WCPFC19,274,"Samoa, on behalf of FFA members, noted the skipjack management procedure may be adopted at WCPFC19 in alignment with the HSWP, but stated that the South Pacific albacore MP and TRPs for both yellowfin and bigeye tuna would not be ready for adoption until 2024.  They stated that as suggested in their intervention under Agenda Item 6.2.1.3, FFA members supported rescheduling the selection of TRPs for the bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks to 2024, while the Commission continues to develop the multi-species modelling framework and other work such as the consideration of candidate management procedures for the tropical longline fisheries. They stated that the same applied to the South Pacific albacore MP; the timeframe to adopt that MP needs to be extended until more work can be done to develop the axes of uncertainty in the operating models and to give the necessary time for SC and the Commission to properly evaluate the candidate, model-based HCRs currently under development.  Further, there are important considerations around the inclusion of the EPO on the performance of the MP. They stated that FFA members remain very committed to the successful implementation of the HSWP, but recognise that the plan is ambitious and will need to be updated based on the decisions made at WCPFC19; they noted that SMD01 agreed that the HSWP would be updated at WCPFC19. FFA members also encouraged further capacity-building initiatives and expressed their appreciation for the two Harvest Strategy Capacity Building workshops organised by the WCPFC Secretariat in 2022 to support CCMs understanding of harvest strategy components and implications. They noted that such initiatives greatly assist CCMs, and particularly SIDS, in participating fully and having confidence in the harvest strategy development process and its outcomes when implemented."
WCPFC19,275,"RMI agreed that adoption of a bigeye and yellowfin MP could be scheduled for 2025, but stated that it would be contingent on what is decided at WCPFC19 in terms of the skipjack MP, as the various components are all related. RMI inquired regarding the implications for the HSWP and various other work streams should the Commission fail to reach a decision on a skipjack MP at WCPFC19. Dr Larcombe stated that for the skipjack MP additional technical work was not needed, and the Commission was well placed to make a decision; thus the issue was reaching a decision through negotiation. If no decision was reached SPC would have to do additional work on skipjack for an extra year or so, which would increase its workload to some degree, and this could create a backlog and delay other elements of the harvest strategy work."
WCPFC19,276,"Following relevant outcomes at WCPFC19, Australia presented an updated Indicative Workplan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies."
WCPFC19,277,WCPFC19 adopted the updated Indicative Workplan for the Adoption of Harvest Strategies under CMM 2014-06 (Attachment M).  51    7.2 Science-Management Dialogue
WCPFC19,278,"The Executive Director introduced WCPFC19-2022-20 Reference Document on the Science-Management Dialogue, which highlighted the key issues that the Commission needs to consider for determining the future arrangements of the Science-Management Dialogue (SMD). He noted that the substantive outcomes of the SMD01 were addressed under Agenda Item 6. He further noted that the SMD01 was held on a trial basis on 19 and 21 of August 2022. The agenda for the SMD01 was based on a set of ‘focus areas’ provided by the Commission and views and comments of CCMs.  One of the agenda items sought guidance from the SMD01 on the focus and timing of future meetings of the SMD, which the SMD01 deferred to the Commission.  The Executive Director stated that the reference paper WCPFC19-2022-20, outlines in paragraph 7, some issues that may guide the Commission deliberations on future arrangements for the SMD including whether it should be constituted formally such as other subsidiary bodies, so it can render recommendations to the Commission; what the schedule of meetings and focus areas should be; whether it should held in a similar fashion to SMD01, with focus areas provided; what additional training and capacity building needs CCMs have; and whether the short term focus should align with the HSWP. He further stated that paragraph 8 of the paper highlights some longer-term issues which are provided for information but not for immediate resolution."
WCPFC19,279,"Palau on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau stated the SMD was useful for building understanding among managers and science personnel in the initial stage of development and operation of harvest strategies, but that it was not very useful considering the time involved in advancing work on the skipjack MP. They stated they could support holding another SMD in 2024 to support the further development and initial operation on harvest strategies with the purpose of that SMD to be defined by the Commission in 2023 when there is a better idea of what the priorities are in the HSWP for 2024. They did not support having an SMD in 2023, while noting some FFA members requested consideration of an SMD in 2023 for South Pacific albacore. They stated that their priorities for 2023 are work on the TTM and the CMS, which would not leave room for an SMD as well."
WCPFC19,280,"Kiribati, on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau, supported the statement delivered by Palau, noting the SMD was useful to build understanding on the development and early stage of implementation of harvest strategy work. However, it did not support holding the SMD as a separate ongoing meeting. It stated that in considering any future SMDs that the harvest strategy process could be simply added to the existing Commission programme, and that harvest strategy work should be undertaken without establishing any new Commission meetings or bodies. They stated they were open to discussions around options for streamlining some of the other elements of the Commission’s work, but did not support a permanent SMD."
WCPFC19,281,"The EU noted the need for a flexible, collective process, and observed that at WCPFFC19 some discussions had involved science and management issues, such as the discussion on a harvest strategy for skipjack and stated that these issues could have been progressed through a dedicated SMD. The EU stated it would prefer that the SMD process be more institutionalised, and possibly be aligned with the HSWP. The EU also voiced support for continued capacity building. The EU suggested that an annual paper be prepared for the Commission on what harvest strategy activities occurred throughout year. The EU also stated it would welcome an opportunity for CCM scientists to engage with SPC on harvest strategy issues during the year, stating that this would allow more feedback to CCMs, and would be helpful in progressing the work. In terms of scheduling SMD meetings, the EU stated that holding it directly after SC was not ideal but stated it was flexible on that issue."
WCPFC19,282,"Australia stated that SMD01 was helpful in terms of progressing the skipjack MP. It stated that it could agree to not hold an SMD in 2023. It stated that the discussions in the South Pacific albacore SWG and the presentation on the HSWP suggested an SMD could be useful in 2024, focussed on adoption of the 52    South Pacific albacore MP. It suggested looking at the tasks in the HSWP which would benefit from such a forum."
WCPFC19,283,"RMI stated that it participated in SMD01 with keen interest and found it very useful in focussing on the skipjack MP. RMI stated that building understanding of the science is important and useful for management decisions, and supported continuation of such dialogues on a case-by-case basis, in line with the work scheduled through the HSWP. RMI looked forward to seeing the skipjack MP as an outcome at WCPFC19, noting that if agreement could not be reached it called into question the value of the SMD process. RMI stated that the priorities for 2023 should be the TTM, modifying the CMS, and running the skipjack MP."
WCPFC19,284,"New Zealand acknowledged the value of SMD01, which prepared for the discussions on the skipjack MP. It agreed that an SMD would not be needed in 2023, given that the SPALB_RM-IWG would be focussing on the harvest strategy issues for that species and suggested it would be useful when the focus turned to a South Pacific albacore MP. In terms of timing New Zealand stated it would prefer a gap after SC so that SC outcomes could be considered, and stated that there is scope for the SMD to be virtual."
WCPFC19,285,"Cook Islands agreed that this is an important discussion, and noted the need for interface between scientists and managers. It stated that as noted by RMI, SMD01 was valuable in advancing the skipjack MP, while a future SMD could help progress work on South Pacific albacore. It agreed that the timing of SMDs is important, and suggested that the SPALB_RM-IWG could consider its progress and the need for an SMD in 2023 versus 2024."
WCPFC19,286,"Palau supported RMI’s comment noting the need of its delegation for scientific advice for management, and stated that if scientists had reached agreement, the Commission should move forward with MPs."
WCPFC19,287,"PNG support the prior statement by Palau on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau, and the statement by RMI. PNG stated its 2023 priorities are the TTM renewal and work on the CMS. It agreed on the importance of the SMD for harvest strategy work, and stated that an SMD could be useful if it did not interfere with work on the TTM and the CMS, and suggested that SPC could possibly advise on this."
WCPFC19,288,"Indonesia stated it is important to have SMDs to ensure CCMs have a shared understanding of the underlying science. It stated its support for holding an SMD in 2023, while noting the substantial work to be done on the TTM. It suggested holding an SMD after SC, but preferred for it to be virtual."
WCPFC19,289,"The Ocean Foundation and Pew Charitable Trusts stated that it was encouraging to hear widespread support for the SMD process, and urged the Commission to adopt a permanent process to hold SMD. They stated it would be useful to set expectations that this discussion is important to the Commission and will continue in future years, as no other body brings together scientists, managers and stakeholders to have these discussions. They stated that a meeting in 2023 would be needed given the large amount of work to progress MPs for South Pacific albacore and remaining work on skipjack, depending on the output of WCPFC19. They also stated that it is important to build on the momentum from SMD01, and suggested that the Commission should feel good about the process. Members were well prepared, sought useful clarifications, exchanged views, and identified areas of further work. They stated that the dialogue process will be critical to enable the Commission to meet the goals in its HSWP."
WCPFC19,290,"The Chair noted that CCMs recognized the merit of the SMD process, but expressed the view that the main focus for 2023 should be on revision of TTM, which would make it hard to hold an SMD; the need for an SMD in 2024 could be assessed depending on HSWP implementation. The Chair also noted that scientists and managers were interacting to progress specific harvest strategy-related issues, but that this was taking place outside an organized SMD process. 53"
WCPFC19,291,"WCPFC19 noted the value of the SMD01 in assisting to progress a Management Procedure for skipjack tuna.  Given the heavy workload in 2023, particularly with the review of the Tropical Tuna CMM, WCPFC19 agreed not to hold an SMD in 2023 and agreed to assess the need to hold an SMD in 2024 depending on progress in the Commission’s harvest strategy work.   AGENDA ITEM 8  — WCPO SHARK STOCKS AND BYCATCH MITIGATION"
WCPFC19,292,"The Chair stated that under Agenda Item 8 the meeting would consider issues concerning the conservation and management of shark stocks within the purview of the WCPFC, and also discuss other bycatch mitigation issues such as seabird mitigation, best practices for safe handling and release of cetaceans, and ecosystem and climate indicators.  8.1 Sharks 8.1.1 Review of the status of WCPO shark stocks"
WCPFC19,293,"Dr. Paul Hammer (SPC-OFP) presented a summary of the status of key WCPFC key shark species, with a focus on the two most recent shark assessments in the WCPFC Convention Area: Southwest Pacific blue shark (conducted over 2021 and 2022) and Southwest Pacific mako shark (conducted in 2022). The presentation noted the current WCPFC key sharks that include: mako shark (2 species), blue shark, thresher sharks (3 species), silky shark, oceanic whitetip shark, whale shark, hammerhead sharks (4 species), and porbeagle shark (south of 20°S). The presentation noted the key documents that provide provisions for general shark management (CMM 2019-04), listing of sharks as WCPFC key sharks (WCPFC Key Document SC-08, 2012), and guiding research and assessment scheduling (2021-2025 Shark Research Plan; SC16-EB-IP-01). The Southwest Pacific blue shark assessment began in 2021. The assessment presented in that year was a thorough integrated assessments using Stock Synthesis, and included a large range of uncertainties. The assessment presented an ensemble of 3,888 models as a basis for management advice. However, the SC was concerned that the model ensemble required refinements to reduce the number of models, as it was difficult for the SC to consider the merits and relative reliability of so many models. In 2022, the assessment team conducted further work to refine the model ensemble down to 288 models that better reflected uncertainty and this model ensemble was accepted by SC18 to be the basis for management advice. Based on the revised set of 288 models, the assessment indicated that according to MSY based reference points (noting there are not alternative reference points adopted for WCPFC sharks) the blue shark stock in the Southwest Pacific was not overfished (SB > SBMSY) and overfishing was not occurring (F < FMSY). A summary of the attempted assessment of shortfin mako shark in the Southwest Pacific Ocean was then provided. The assessment attempted an integrated assessment using Stock Synthesis. The assessment confronted many issues with data quantity and data coverage, and also noted conflicting trends in CPUE that were problematic to understand and model. The model outputs where highly sensitive to data and other assumptions and were not considered reliable enough to be a basis for management advice. The SC18 did not accept the assessment as a basis for management advice. The status of the shortfin mako shark stock in the Southwest Pacific Ocean remains uncertain. Some problematic areas for future assessment attempts were raised, in particular, the fact that there are very few data of other information on reproductive sized females. This makes any assessment or risk-based approach that aims to provide indication of the status/risks for the reproductive component of the stock difficult. Further, catch reconstruction continues to provide a major uncertainty in shark assessments, and it was recommended that shark catch estimates are also provided for north and south of the equator.  The presentation finished with a summary table of the current knowledge of stock status for the WCPFC key sharks, and their listings under the IUCN Red List and CITES 54    appendices, noting all key sharks except blue shark are CITES Appendix II listed. The 2021-2025 shark research plan indicated that the next assessment for key sharks in the WCPO is silky shark, with the recommendation that this (and future shark assessments) occur across two years, with work on the assessment inputs occurring in 2023 and the assessment conducted in 2024. The recommendation to run shark assessments across two years acknowledges the challenges with these assessments, including the additional work required to do catch reconstructions and better incorporate patchy and uncertain data, but also that shark assessments are funded as WCPFC projects for which contracts are typically only agreed by February. This leaves only 4-5 months to complete the assessment by the SC meeting. Experience has shown that this is not enough time."
WCPFC19,294,WCPFC19 noted with appreciation the presentations by the Scientific Services Provider and the ISC on the status of WCPO shark stocks.  8.1.1.1 Southwest Pacific blue shark
WCPFC19,295,"The Chair noted WCPFC19-2022-21 Reference Document for Southwest Pacific blue shark, and stated that the key recommendation from SC for the Commission’s consideration is to note the SC18 advice “that Southwest Pacific blue shark is unlikely to be overfished and it is unlikely that overfishing is occurring when considered against MSY and depletion-based reference points”."
WCPFC19,296,"The EU noted that much work had been done on Southwest Pacific blue shark, and reminded that it had supported the scientific work through voluntary financial contributions. It stated it was pleased SPC and SC were able to provide relevant scientific advice, and that the stock is in a healthy state. The EU stated it supported the proposed recommendation regarding conducting shark stock assessments over 2 years, stating its understanding that it concerns the key shark species."
WCPFC19,297,"Tokelau on behalf of FFA members thanked SPC for the work done on assessing Southwest Pacific blue shark, and noted its current status as “not overfished and not subject to overfishing”, and fully supported the recommendations from SC18, particularly with regard to providing more time for analysis and supporting research recommendations to improve future shark assessments."
WCPFC19,298,WCPFC19 noted the advice from SC 18 “that the Southwest Pacific blue shark is unlikely to be overfished and it is unlikely that overfishing is occurring when considered against MSY and depletion-based reference points”.
WCPFC19,299,WCPFC19 endorsed the proposal to allow shark assessments to occur over two years.  8.1.1.2 Southwest Pacific shortfin mako shark
WCPFC19,300,"The Chair noted WCPFC19-2022-22 Reference Document for Southwest Pacific shortfin mako shark which includes related decisions and recommendations from SC18 and TCC18 concerning the Southwest Pacific shortfin mako shark. She stated that the key advice from SC18 and TCC18 to WCPFC19 includes: i) SC18 found it unable to provide stock status or trend information on Southwest Pacific shortfin mako shark to the Commission, as the status remains unknown; and ii) Both SC18 and TCC18 recommended that paragraph 1 bullet point 3 of the ‘Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission’ should include the following sentence: “The estimates of annual catch for key shark species should be separated into catch north and south of the equator and the WCPFC Secretariat should work with CCMs to get these data retrospectively corrected where possible.” 55"
WCPFC19,301,"The EU stated that it could understand the challenges involved in the Southwest Pacific shortfin mako shark assessment, and the need to spend a year on data analysis and reconstruction so as to avoid the need to do all the work in one year. It inquired regarding the next steps for this species, as the stock assessment has been inconclusive, and noted there was nothing scheduled for this species in the stock assessment schedule. The EU stated it would like to see this work advancing and being concluded as soon as possible. SPC acknowledged that the Southwest Pacific shortfin mako shark stock assessment was inconclusive, and stated that they had considered simpler approaches, such as production models. SPC noted the large uncertainty in the CPUE, which is not indexing the productive part of the stock. Time constraints meant the researchers could not talk to countries to better understand the data conflicts. SPC stated this issue could be addressed during the mid-term review of the shark research plan."
WCPFC19,302,"New Zealand noted that the word “mako” is often mispronounced – it comes from Te Reo Māori.  On behalf of FFA members, New Zealand stated that they appreciated the work undertaken to attempt a stock assessment for Southwest Pacific shortfin mako shark and supported the recommendations from SPC and SC18 that the stock assessment should be considered preliminary and should not be used as the basis for management advice. They also supported the recommendations from SC18 to encourage the practice of releasing shortfin mako sharks and the recommendations regarding further research, particularly with regards to providing more time for analysis and supporting research recommendations to improve future shark assessments. They also supported the recommendation from SC18 and TCC18 to separate estimates of annual catch of key shark species into catch north and south of the equator and to retrospectively correct data where possible."
WCPFC19,303,"PNG on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau supported the FFA statement. They noted the challenge faced by scientists when trying to assess sharks, and the proposal for carrying shark assessment over two years to assist with the data preparation time and allow more input from the pre-assessment working group, and supported that approach. They expressed the hope that in the future, with expanded observer coverage and extended time allowed for the assessment, that an assessment of Southwest Pacific shortfin mako shark could be successfully concluded."
WCPFC19,304,"The USA noted that the stock assessments for some key shark species are done Pacific-wide, and suggested appropriate language be inserted in the proposed recommendation to reflect this."
WCPFC19,305,WCPFC19 noted the advice of SC18 that the stock assessment results of Southwest Pacific shortfin mako sharks were preliminary and not robust enough to provide management advice.
WCPFC19,306,"WCPFC19 agreed to amend paragraph 1 of the Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission (Attachment N) relating to annual catch data for key shark species to read as follows: Estimates of annual catches The following estimates of catches during each calendar year shall be provided to the Commission for each gear type:  • catches of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), blue marlin (Makaira mazara) and black marlin (Makaira indica) in: 1) the WCPFC Statistical Area (see paragraph #8), and 2) the portion of the WCPFC Statistical Area east of the 150° meridian of west longitude;  56    • catches of albacore (Thunnus alalunga), striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax), swordfish (Xiphias gladius), Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis), thresher sharks (Alopias spp.), blue shark (Prionace glauca) and mako sharks (Isurus spp.) in: 1) the Pacific Ocean south of the Equator, 2) the Pacific Ocean north of the Equator, 3) the WCPFC Statistical Area north of the Equator, 4) the WCPFC Statistical Area south of the Equator, and 5) the portion of the WCPFC Statistical Area east of the 150° meridian of west longitude; and  • silky shark, oceanic whitetip shark, thresher sharks, blue shark, mako sharks, porbeagle shark (south of 20°S, until biological data show this or another geographic limit to be appropriate), hammerhead sharks (winghead, scalloped, great, and smooth), and whale shark in the WCPFC Statistical Area (see paragraph #8).   8.1.1.3 North Pacific blue shark"
WCPFC19,307,"ISC Vice-Chair Dr Shui-Kai Chang, on behalf of the ISC Chair, presented summaries of stock status of North Pacific blue shark (BSH) in 2022. The information was based on a benchmark assessment in 2022 which used same model structure as 2017 assessment but with additional data up to 2020, applying Beverton-Holt stock recruit relationship (SR) rather than low fecundity SR, and adopting the model ensemble approach. The results show that the SSB declined from the mid-1970s to 1990 and has since increased and stabilized around 100,000 t through the 2000s. The median estimates of current SSB are about SSBMSY. Stock status reported in relation to MSY-based reference points that: median female SSB in 2020 was estimated to be 1.170 of SSBMSY (80th percentile, 0.570 - 1.776) and is likely (63.5% probability) not in an overfished condition; recent annual F (F2017-2019) is estimated to be below FMSY and overfishing of the stock is very likely (91.9% probability) not occurring; and the base case model results show that there is a 61.9% joint probability that stock is not in an overfished condition and that overfishing is not occurring. Future projections in three of the four harvest scenarios: Fcurrent (2017-2019), Fcurrent+20%, and Fcurrent–20% showed that median BSH SSB will likely increase and remain above SSBMSY in the next ten years; the FMSY harvest scenario led to a decrease in median SSB to below SSBMSY. There remain some uncertainties in the assessment, and therefore continued improvements in the monitoring of BSH catches and continued research into the biology, ecology, and spatial structure of BSH are recommended. SC18 noted that the current assessment is an improvement over the previous assessment and supports the model ensemble approach taken in the 2022 stock assessment as a more comprehensive way of characterizing structural uncertainty in stock status. However, SC18 noted that the model ensemble approach did not consider some key uncertainties and so recommended a more thorough use of the approach to better represent uncertainty for future assessments. SC18 also noted that recent estimated recruitment was below the average level, and that if these low recruitments persist into the future, then the projection results could be overly optimistic."
WCPFC19,308,"Palau stated on behalf of FFA members that they were pleased to note the improved status of blue shark in the North Pacific as not being overfished and not subject to overfishing. They supported the recommendations from SC18 for a more thorough use of the model ensemble approach to better represent uncertainty for future assessments, and with regard to providing more time for analysis and supporting research recommendations to improve future shark assessments."
WCPFC19,309,"WCPFC19 endorsed the advice of SC18 that North Pacific blue shark is not in an overfished condition and that overfishing is not occurring relative to MSY based reference points (WCPFC19-2022-23, paragraph 2).  57    8.1.2 Review of CMM for Sharks (CMM 2019-04)"
WCPFC19,310,The Chair noted that WCPFC19-2022-24 Reference Document for the review of CMM for Sharks (CMM 2019-04) includes recommendations from SC18 and TCC18 of relevance to the discussion in support of the review of CMM 2019-04 on sharks. The Chair also noted that the USA and Canada introduced a proposal under Agenda Item 4: WCPFC19-2022-DP01 Proposed Revisions to the CMM for Sharks.
WCPFC19,311,"Tokelau on behalf of FFA members thanked the USA and Canada for the proposal and the completion of the CMM 2013-06 assessment, which FFA members stated they considered to be thorough, providing ample consideration of the potential impacts on SIDS, including that implementation of the new provisions outlined would not come into effect until 1 January 2024, allowing time for CCMs to implement them. They stated that this is an important issue for FFA members, and that the use of wire traces and shark lines by longline vessels operating within FFA members’ waters is already prohibited through FFA’s Harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions, and all sharks landed by all vessels licensed to fish within FFA members' waters and those flagged to FFA require all fins to be naturally attached, or finning is managed through alternative measures. However, they queried how the Commission will monitor the clause on trailing gear as proposed, and suggested other wording changes. They supported the recommendations from SC18 and TCC18, stating that the proposed amendments as necessary, particularly given concerns with regards to the depleted stock status for oceanic whitetip and silky sharks and the lack of any apparent alternative effective management options. They stated that they consider the ban on wire trace and shark lines as a critical step to reduce mortality of oceanic whitetip sharks, and supported the proposal of the USA and Canada. FFA members noted that the measure had yet to be assessed in the CMR process. They noted it is listed in Attachment S “List of Obligations to be Reviewed in the 2022 Draft Compliance Monitoring Report (Covering 2021 Activities)” of the WCPFC18 Report, and while noting TCC18’s recommendation that the Commission consider adopting the same or a very similar list of obligations for review in both the 2022 and 2023 draft CMRs (dCMR), they suggested prioritising this measure for CMR assessment in 2023."
WCPFC19,312,"New Caledonia thanked the USA for its proposal, and thanked FFA members for their support. New Caledonia stated it banned all shark fishing in 2013, and that its waters formed one of the biggest marine sanctuaries in the world. New Caledonia noted that sharks have a crucial role in offshore ecosystems, and are also important both socially and culturally. For all these reasons New Caledonia has decided to fully protect sharks, and stated it supports the USA’s proposal."
WCPFC19,313,"French Polynesia stated that it agreed with New Caledonia regarding the important cultural and biological roles of sharks and strongly supported the proposal, including the language regarding cutting the branch line as close as possible to the shark."
WCPFC19,314,"The EU referenced the finning prohibition, and noted that in the previous CMM there were three options for implementation of a finning ban, with information to be provided to TCC to allow for evaluation of the CMM’s effectiveness. The EU stated it was time to look into this and ensure that information is made available to TCC19 to assist on deliberations on this important matter. The EU also stated that the existing CMM is good and supported the intent of improving and strengthening it, while suggesting the need for some fine tuning."
WCPFC19,315,RMI fully supported adoption of the measure.
WCPFC19,316,"In the ensuing discussion some CCMs raised concerns regarding the deadlines contained in the proposal; the inclusion of a prohibition on “carrying” wire traces, in addition to their use, suggesting this could restrict vessel movements; and inclusion of “billfish” in the CMM along with sharks. Other CCMs noted the need to strengthen and not roll back any elements of the existing CMM; noted the need for compatibility with FFA measures, and supported the inclusion of “billfish”; and supported a prohibition on 58    carrying wire traces, noting that low observer coverage made it difficult to monitor compliance with a prohibition on their use."
WCPFC19,317,Following further consideration CCMs agreed to the revised CMM. The EU noted that in supporting the proposal it did so with the understanding that this set no precedent for extending the scope of the measure beyond what was agreed without specific and robust scientific advice.
WCPFC19,318,WCPFC19 adopted CMM 2022-04 Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks (Attachment O).   8.2 Seabird Mitigation 8.2.1 Review of CMM 2018-03
WCPFC19,319,The Chair noted that recommendations from SC18 and TCC18 are contained in reference paper WCPFC19-2022-25 Reference document for Agenda 8.2 – 8.4 on ecosystem and bycatch mitigation
WCPFC19,320,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members noted the decline in albatross and petrel populations globally, as well as within the WCPFC area which; they stated that this, coupled with the lack of monitoring in the longline fishery, gave them significant cause for concern. FFA members noted the recommendations from SC18 to conduct a review of the current seabird mitigation measure (CMM 2018-03) against ACAP Best Practices within the next two years, with particular attention to bycatch mitigation and improved monitoring."
WCPFC19,321,"New Zealand expressed its deep concern about the threat to many seabird species, particularly albatrosses and petrels, from bycatch in longline fisheries in the WCPFC area, noting that recent science shows that one of the most threatened species the Antipodean albatross continues to decline at a rate of 5% per annum, and faces imminent extinction unless bycatch is addressed in those high-risk areas where there is overlap between tuna longline fishing and the foraging of these birds. SC18 recommended that the Commission conduct a review of the current seabird mitigation measure (CMM 2018-03) during 2023-2024 in order to evaluate effective bycatch mitigations. New Zealand stated that this was a high priority and that there is scope to strengthen the CMM to ensure that effective seabird mitigation methods are required and used in the Convention Area.  New Zealand proposed, for example: i) ensuring there are appropriately strong seabird mitigations in the areas in both the southern and northern hemispheres within the core range of the antipodean albatross; ii) strengthening and improving the requirements for line weighting and tori line specifications; iii) eliminating ineffective mitigation options from the measure, e.g., blue-dyed bait, streamer less tori lines, and offal discharge; and iv) improving monitoring of the longline fishery in order to improve implementation of seabird mitigations. New Zealand stated it is prepared to lead this work in close collaboration with others. It also drew attention to a one page “flyer” for fishing vessels that New Zealand has posted on the WCPFC website for this meeting, which has been translated into multiple languages.  New Zealand stated it is tracking albatrosses so that there is an alert when a seabird is captured.  Vessels are required to keep the tracker and notify the vessel owner."
WCPFC19,322,"EU stated that it supported these recommendations, and thanked New Zealand for its suggestions, noting its support for evaluating the effectiveness of CMMs that are being implemented. It supported the suggestions from New Zealand and commended its efforts to strengthen conservation of these species."
WCPFC19,323,"Australia welcomed New Zealand’s intervention and shared the concerns expressed, and stated it looked forward to working together. 59"
WCPFC19,324,The USA stated it supported a commitment from WCPFC19 to review the CMM in 2023-2024. The USA noted that it is conducting ongoing research and expressed the hope that the work would prove useful when complete.
WCPFC19,325,"New Caledonia supported New Zealand’s intervention, and stated that it is working with its longline fisheries to begin deployment of tori lines on its first boats in 2023, and seeking to deploy them across its entire fleet in 2024."
WCPFC19,326,"ACAP stated that it fully supported the recommendation for the review and updating of the CMM on seabirds. ACAP was  pleased to hear the support expressed by New Zealand and other delegations. It noted that at SC18 ACAP had presented a paper providing a thorough update on ACAP’s most recent best practice advice on seabird bycatch mitigation, and new ACAP guidelines.  . ACAP stated it would be happy to take part in the work to update and revise CMM 2018-03 based on this most recent advice."
WCPFC19,327,"Birdlife International stated its thanks to New Zealand for taking the lead to ensure seabird bycatch mitigation measures are implemented. It acknowledged there are many issues to work through, and stated it did not wish to detract attention from those. It welcomed the review of seabird bycatch mitigation, and noted it has extensive experience in working with vessels on practical measures to help address seabird bycatch."
WCPFC19,328,"WCPFC19 noted a global decline in specific Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) seabird population trends, which are vulnerable to threats posed by longline fisheries in the WCPO and the importance of seabird bycatch mitigation measures."
WCPFC19,329,WCPFC19 agreed to conduct review of the current seabird mitigation measure (CMM 2018-03 Conservation and Management Measure to mitigate the impact of fishing for highly migratory fish stocks on seabirds) in 2023 or 2024 whereby new bycatch mitigation studies would be evaluated with respect to bycatch mitigation effectiveness and compared against current ACAP Best Practices.   8.3 Graphics for Best Practices for Safe Handling and Release of Cetaceans
WCPFC19,330,"The Chair stated that the graphics for best practices for safe handling and release of cetaceans are contained in Attachment 1 of WCPFC19-2022-25 Reference document for Agenda 8.2 – 8.4 on ecosystem and bycatch mitigation, and that SC18 and TCC18 recommended they be adopted."
WCPFC19,331,WCPFC19 adopted the Graphics for Best Practices for the Safe Handling and Release of Cetaceans. (Attachment P)  8.4 Ecosystem and Bycatch Mitigation 8.4.1 Ecosystem and climate indicators
WCPFC19,332,"Dr Steven Hare (SPC-OFP) presented WCPFC19-2022-IP02 2021 Fishery overview and status of stocks, restricted to the Ecosystem and Climate Indicators section. At SC18, a set of candidate ecosystem and climate indicators was presented for consideration for adoption (WCPFC-SC18-2022-EB-WP-01). In particular, “SC18 recommended that available information and updates on the impacts of climate change be included or combined with status of stocks reporting.” Further, SC18 recommended that ecosystem and bycatch indicators be presented annually to the SC as a standing agenda item, and the identification of their implications and subsequent triggers be developed. Examples of various types of indicators developed by 60    the Scientific Services Provider were provided. Several climate indices, characterizing environmental variability in the central and western Pacific over the past 20 years were illustrated. Observer data were used as the basis to estimate trends in gear-specific shark and billfish catch. Both shark and billfish catch are two orders of magnitude higher in the longline fishery than the purse seine fishery. The El Niño Southern Oscillation is a major driver of oceanic conditions in the tropical Pacific and its impact on the purse seine fishery has long been recognized. The spatial extent, and centre of activity, can vary by thousands of kilometres between years, particularly when comparing El Niño and La Niña events. The WCPO has experienced two consecutive years of La Niña conditions and the current forecast is for a third consecutive year. Recent work by the Scientific Services Provider has considered the likely impact on target tuna stocks of the WCPO. The three tropical tunas are projected to decrease in biomass by 15%-38%, with the greatest decline estimated for skipjack. Further, it is predicted that distribution of the three tropical tunas will shift to the east, with large biomass declines, especially for skipjack, in the western part of their distribution and a net increase in biomass in the EPO."
WCPFC19,333,"Niue on behalf of FFA members noted the suite of ecosystem and climate indicators proposed by the Scientific Services Provider and supported the development of a project to evaluate and potentially adopt these indicators. They stated that Pacific leaders have repeatedly highlighted the particular importance of addressing climate change impacts to the region, and stated that FFA members support the recommendations of SC18 to mainstream this important work into the SC processes and reporting as a standing agenda item. In further strengthening climate change work and discussions at WCPFC, FFA members supported the proposal by the USA (in WCPFC19-2022-DP14) to add climate change as a standing item at NC and TCC.  In addition, FFA members encouraged WCPFC to continue to actively consider how climate change can be incorporated into its work, and along that line, recommended that climate change be a standing agenda item at the annual Commission meeting. FFA members stated they were pleased to co-sponsor the USA’s discussion paper on climate change, especially as it has added the FFA suggestion that climate change be added as a standing agenda item for the annual Commission meeting."
WCPFC19,334,"Japan thanked SPC for the informative presentation, and stated it is very important to take into account climate change factors when considering harvest strategies and other management measures for tuna stocks. It stated that in 2022 the catch of skipjack in coastal and offshore areas of Japan had been very poor (a decrease of 20% from the 2021 level, which was already low). Japan stated that some fishers had encountered financial difficulties in continuing this fishery, particularly in coastal areas. It noted the need to maintain a stable level of tropical tuna stocks to ensure a stable catch. Japan stated it was not alone in facing this problem, and referenced some tropical purse seine fisheries that have had trouble finding good fish schools. Japan stated that it has good technology to find and catch fish, but fishing efficiency has declined. Japan stated that coastal states such as itself have very significant coastal and offshore fisheries, and noted the need to maintain fisheries in a stable condition, as they would otherwise lose important fishing industries. For this reason, it stated it is important to promote study of climate change, and having this as a standing agenda item is important. Japan stated that it was eager to address these issues in the context of a discussion of the skipjack harvest strategies. Japan stated it would support continuing the work."
WCPFC19,335,"Tuvalu inquired if it was correct that the longline shark catch is some 1.5 to 2 million individuals per year. SPC affirmed that is correct, compared to the purse seine bycatch of 50,000-100,000 individuals (as addressed in WCPFC19-2022-IP02, p. 11). Tuvalu stated that this makes a strong case for the need for bycatch mitigation in the longline fishery."
WCPFC19,336,"New Caledonia observed that climate change is affecting the region’s fishery, and that as islands cannot be moved, coastal fisheries in the western Pacific will be most impacted. It supported both the work and the FFA statement. 61"
WCPFC19,337,"New Zealand voiced support for SPC to conduct this analysis, and stated that it has experienced declines in catch of skipjack in its waters, and welcomed the analysis of the change in stock distribution."
WCPFC19,338,"The EU thanked SPC for the work and supported its continuation. It also supported the inclusion of a standing agenda item on ecosystem and climate in all Commission meetings, noting it is a planetary issue of concern to everyone. It voiced the need to take this duly into consideration. Regarding Tuvalu’s comment, it stated that it would help in future presentations to discriminate between protected and commercial sharks, as this would be more informative. SPC stated the data was for sharks taken by the commercial longline fishery, and not artisanal fishing. The EU clarified it was referring to species that are considered commercial species, as against some with retention bans. SPC stated that the data could likely be separated."
WCPFC19,339,"Indonesia agreed on the growing concern regarding climate change impacts. It stated that under the WPEA-SM project, the three participating countries (Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam) had studied climate change impacts. Indonesia stated that that at the national level it is very hard to find experts to help assess climate change impacts related to tuna fisheries, and remarked on the need for more capacity building to understand future climate change impacts on fisheries. Indonesia also remarked on recent increased archipelagic waters catch of South Pacific albacore, caused by more fish entering the archipelagic waters, possibly as a result of climate change."
WCPFC19,340,"RMI thanked SPC and stated that consideration of climate change was critical to ensure CCMs keep abreast of climate change developments, and how they may impact the objectives and mission of the Commission. RMI supported the comments by Niue and looked forward to SPC’s continuing work on this."
WCPFC19,341,"French Polynesia thanked SPC, and joined other CCMs in stating that such studies are very important."
WCPFC19,342,WCPFC19 endorsed the following recommendations of SC18 relating to climate change:  i SC18 recommended making “Ecosystem and Climate Indicators” a standing agenda item of the Ecosystem and Bycatch Mitigation Theme session. This would provide a mechanism for the Scientific Committee to annually consider adopting candidate indicators presented to the Committee but also review and respond to existing trends/triggers identified in adopted indicators.  ii SC18 recommended the development and testing of “Ecosystem and Climate Indicators” as a project of the Scientific Committee. This would provide a mechanism for the Scientific Committee to easily track its progress towards evaluating and adopting candidate indicators. iii SC18 recommended that available information and updates on the impacts of climate change be included or combined with status of stocks reporting.
WCPFC19,343,"Recognizing the urgency of developing a comprehensive approach to understanding and addressing the impacts of climate change on highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area, and any related impacts on the economies of CCMs and food security and the livelihoods of their people, in particular Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Participating Territories, the Commission agrees to include Climate Change as a standing agenda item and to prioritize discussion of how best to incorporate climate change information and analyses in its work, as well as the work of TCC and the NC. 62      AGENDA ITEM 9  —  COMPLIANCE MONITORING SCHEME"
WCPFC19,344,"The Chair stated that the Commission would consider the outcomes of the work of the CMS-IWG that was tasked to progress the various work streams under the “Future Work” component of CMM 2021-03 on the WCPFC CMS. She stated that the working group was chaired by the TCC-Vice Chair, Ms Emily Crigler (USA). As agreed by the Commission at WCPFC18, a 2022 CMR (covering activities for 2021) was not considered by TCC18, and thus would not be considered at WCPFC19; she noted it was scheduled for consideration (together with the 2023 CMR covering 2022 activities) by TCC19 and WCPFC20. 9.1 CMS-IWG Workplan to Progress the CMS Future Work Included in Section IX of CMM 2021-03 Compliance Monitoring Scheme"
WCPFC19,345,The Chair stated that the reference papers included WCPFC19-2022-26 Reference document on TCC18 recommendations for Agenda Item 9 CMS; WCPFC19-2022-27 – a side by side comparison by the Secretariat of draft audit points and the Secretariat’s dCMR criteria; and WCPFC19-2022-IP18 Secretariat’s preliminary assessment of its anticipated work commitments to support work of TCC in 2023 and 2024.
WCPFC19,346,"The TCC Vice-Chair provided an update on the work of the CMS-IWG. She expressed gratitude to the leads of the CMS workstreams for their time and dedication, and to the Secretariat (in particular the Compliance Manager) for support. She noted the CMS-IWG workplan contained the items that the Commission had tasked itself to undertake. She stated that the RBAF work stream was led by Heather Ward, and the proposed framework was used when considering the elements to be evaluated at WCPFC18. She noted that CCMs held additional useful conversations at TCC18, and stated that separate presentations would be made by the leads for the RBAF (under Agenda Item 9.1.1) and audit points (under Agenda Item 9.1.2). She noted that the Secretariat had worked on improvements to the CCFS, and that this would be further addressed in 2023. She noted that the issue of observer participation in the CMR process was discussed at TCC18, and that this would be discussed under Agenda Item 9.1.3. She noted that the goal in 2022 for development of corrective actions was to secure a lead for that work (discussed under Agenda Item 9.1.4). The process to review the aggregate summary tables was discussed under Agenda Item 9.1.5."
WCPFC19,347,Cook Islands on behalf of FFA members thanked the Chair of the CMS-IWG for her work in coordinating the various CMS work streams and noted that there might be a need to review the CMS workplan based on the discussions at WCPFC19.
WCPFC19,348,"Tuvalu on behalf of PNA and Tokelau stated that FFA members had previously said they would consider the issue of observer participation once the revised CMS measure was working as intended. They noted that while there had been substantial progress in improving the CMS, the CMS measure was still far from working as intended. They stated that in particular the imbalance in observer coverage between the purse seine and longline fisheries results in a deeply flawed base of information for the CMR, which completely undermines the fairness of those elements of the CMS that rely on observer data. For this reason, great caution is needed to ensure that this basic unfairness is not compounded by opening up the prospect of this flawed information being misused or misinterpreted outside the CMR. In addition, much of the information used in the CMR is confidential. For these reasons, PNA and Tokelau suggested deleting the work on observer participation from the workplan and replacing it with “work on fixing the effect of the current imbalance and bias in the CMS”."
WCPFC19,349,"RMI supported the statement by Tuvalu, and on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau noted that the revised workplan, which they stated is a very thorough and useful document, which is important because of 63    the large volume of work in the workplan. PNA and Tokelau requested two changes: delete Priority 5 on page 5 on opening the CMS process to observers. PNA and Tokelau stated they did not support that step at this point, and in the light of other priorities requested that it be deleted and the following priority included: “Address the impact of the imbalance in observer information on the CMS.” They stated their view that this is important for two reasons: the imbalance substantially reduces the value of the CMS and therefore the priority that can be attached to it, and it constrains the progress that can be made in strengthening the CMS in areas such as consideration of the aggregate tables and corrective actions. They suggested scheduling work on that task in 2023 so that the outcomes can be used in the process of revising the CMS CMM."
WCPFC19,350,The Chair noted that there appeared to be no concerns with the seven TCC recommendation in paragraph 2 of WCPFC19-2022-16.  The matter of observer participation in the CMS was further considered under Agenda 9.1.3.
WCPFC19,351,"WCPFC19 endorsed the following recommendations of TCC18 on the Compliance Monitoring Scheme Future Work Components (WCPFC19-2022-16, paragraph 2). i TCC18 noted the imbalance between the information available for monitoring compliance between the longline and purse seine fisheries and recommended that the Commission recognise the need to address this imbalance.  ii TCC18 noted that compliance with some obligations cannot be independently verified from available data sources.  TCC18 recommended that WCPFC19 task the Secretariat to develop a paper, which identifies those obligations for which there is a lack of independently verifiable data, as well as potential sources of data that could provide independent verification of those obligations, for review by TCC19.  iii TCC18 recommended that the Commission prioritize the development of additional data collection mechanisms for some obligations to allow for more timely and verifiable data to feed into the CMR process. TCC18 noted in particular there is ongoing work related to ER&EM and transhipment reporting that will allow for more verifiable data to feed into the CMR process.  iv TCC18 noted that some quantitative limits and baselines for some CMMs are not easily accessible to CCMs.  TCC18 recommended that WCPFC19 task the Secretariat to publish tables of CCM’s limits and baselines for all relevant CMMs, and notes on their sources. v TCC18 noted that greater clarity about the basis for determining applicability of obligations may assist CCMs with their annual reporting. TCC18 recommended that WCPFC19 task the Secretariat to update and develop additional guidelines to support determining the applicability of obligations for review by TCC19.  TCC18 recommended that once the applicability has been reviewed by TCC, it is integrated and held on file in the Annual Report Part 2 reporting system.  vi TCC18 noted that additional guidance on reporting statements of implementation may assist CCMs with their annual reporting. TCC18 recommended that 64    WCPFC19 task the Secretariat to update and develop additional guidelines to support CCMs reporting of statements of implementation for review by TCC19.  vii TCC18 recommended to WCPFC19 that it task the Secretariat to maintain the information relevant to the Risk Based Assessment Framework, a list of all binding obligations, audit points, data sources, compliance history and other information which supports the dCMR in one place associated with information related to the Compliance Monitoring Scheme and Conservation and Management Measures.  9.1.1 Develop Audit points"
WCPFC19,352,"The CMS-IWG Audit Point Lead Ms. Rhea Moss-Christian (RMI) reviewed progress in developing audit points for the CMS. She stated that TCC considered 60 draft audit points and agreed to 59 of these and forwarded them to the Commission for adoption, as addressed in WCPFC19-2022-26 Reference Paper for TCC18 Recommendations for Agenda 9 Compliance Monitoring Scheme. TCC18 tasked the CMS-IWG to work on another 100 or so audit points in the runup to WCPFC19. Feedback was received from the IWG participants through November. She noted the progress made at WCPFC19, as outlined in WCPFC19-2022-CMS_AP_rev1 Recommended Audit points for the WCPFC CMS, and described the issues that required further work."
WCPFC19,353,"The USA acknowledged the work undertaken by CMS-IWG lead on audit points, and stated the hope that the work could be completed in 2023as it would be very helpful in the CMR process."
WCPFC19,354,"The EU supported the proposed way forward, and echoed the thanks for the audit point work.  The EU also inquired if the agreed audit points would apply to the 2023 dCMR, and suggested for consistency and in line with common practice for all Commission’s decisions to avoid retroactive application and that they be applied starting in the 2023 fishing season (and thus with the 2024 dCMR)."
WCPFC19,355,"The Compliance Manager stated that WCPFC19-2022-33 Information note on the status of the dCMR prepared by the Secretariat in 2022 for review at TCC19 in 2023 outlines a number of potential issues in the current dCMR, and recommended that it be considered by CCMs. Referring to WCPFC19-2022-27 Side by side comparison of draft Audit Points and Secretariat dCMR criteria, she stated that it appeared feasible to apply the audit points to the 2022 dCMR (for 2021 activities)."
WCPFC19,356,"Tokelau, also on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau, stated that this was part of the work to reform the CMS measure. They thanked the CMS-IWG lead on audit points for the work and supported applying the adopted audit points to the 2022 dCMR and the 2023 compliance assessment review for 2022 fishing activities. They noted that the FAC was looking at a process to build in additional support to the Secretariat to assist with some work in 2023."
WCPFC19,357,Australia supported applying the audit points for both the 2022 and 2023 dCMRs.
WCPFC19,358,"The EU stated that CCMs’ reports for the year 2021 fishing activities had already been submitted, but that these necessarily did not use the criteria adopted at WCPFC19. The EU suggested applying the audit points retroactively to the 2021 activities would be inconsistent with the WCPFC’s normal practices."
WCPFC19,359,"Chinese Taipei supported the concept that these be used, but stated that its intent was not to use them for 2021 activities. As the Secretariat has already reviewed the 2021 activities, Chinese Taipei 65    proposed that they be used beginning with 2022 activities to reduce the workload for both the Secretariat and CCMs."
WCPFC19,360,"New Zealand stated it was confused by the conversation, noting audit points do not change the obligations that exist, just clarify what is required, and stated it was unclear why the agreed audit points could not be used for the 2022 CMR process.. New Zealand noted that the Secretariat had confirmed that the agreed audit points could be applied to both 2022 and 2023 CMRs."
WCPFC19,361,"The EU stated it had a different understanding to New Zealand, and indicated that the Secretariat had already done the assessment and would be obliged to repeat the exercise, resulting in additional workload; alternatively, CCMs would possibly have to revisit what they reported to ensure their reporting is consistent with the new audit points."
WCPFC19,362,"Cook Islands referenced CMM 2021-03 paragraph (e) which states “In 2023, TCC19 shall consider a CMR that assesses CCMs’ compliance over the previous 2-year reporting period (RY2021 and RY2022) using the agreed audit point and risk-based assessment framework adopted by WCPFC19”."
WCPFC19,363,"The Compliance Manager again referenced WCPFC19-2022-33, which provides information on the current status of the dCMR just before WCPFC19. She stated a decision on the process that TCC will be using for the 2021 and 2022 reporting years should consider the number of issues, the fact that a number of CCMs had not previously engaged in the CMR process for 2021 data, and that some may want the opportunity to supplement their responses. She noted the need for due process that would allow for TCC’s consideration of the potential issues that may arise. She noted the need to clarify how this process will be managed through 2023 in the leadup to TCC19."
WCPFC19,364,"Chinese Taipei stated it was OK with using the audit points to cover 2021 activities, but that there was a need to ensure all CCMs had adequate time to provide any supplement information based on new audit points."
WCPFC19,365,"WCPFC19 expressed its sincere appreciation to the Lead of the CMS-IWG work on Audit Points, Rhea Moss-Christian, for her hard work in developing Audit Points."
WCPFC19,366,WCPFC adopted the audit points for the WCPFC Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS)(Attachment Q) and the audit point checklist for proposed new or amended obligations   (Attachment R). WCPFC19 agreed to prioritize work on the remaining audit points in 2023.
WCPFC19,367,"WCPFC19 noted that the Commission at WCPFC18 had agreed in adopting CMM 2021-03 that TCC19, in 2023, shall consider a CMR that assesses CCMs’ compliance over the previous 2-year reporting period (RY2021 and RY2022).  WCPFC19 agreed that the adopted Audit Points will apply to the 2022 dCMR (covering 2021 reporting) and the 2023 dCMR (covering 2022 reporting).  9.1.2 Develop Risk-based Assessment Framework"
WCPFC19,368,"The CMS-IWG RBAF Lead Ms. Heather Ward (New Zealand) reiterated her appreciation to CCMs for their contributions and thanked the WCPFC Secretariat and CMS IWG Chair. She noted the very useful discussion at TCC18 that resulted in the RBAF being recommended to the Commission as to tool to help guide the selection of future lists of obligations for the CMR Review. The RBAF Lead reviewed the purpose of the work, emphasising that the RBAF would not automatically produce an annual list of obligations or 66    determine a multi-year schedule of obligations for assessment – that is a separate process.  The RBAF provides a common language to collectively discuss which obligations pose the highest risk, either because of the likelihood of non-compliance or because of the consequence of non-compliance or the combination of both.  Based on that analysis, we can determine which high-risk obligations deserve greater or more regular scrutiny in the CMS process and, conversely, which low-risk obligations can be treated differently.  In addition, CCMs could also consider whether certain obligations (such as quantitative limits) should be “baked in” to the annual list and whether certain implementation obligations which are “kept on file” should still be regularly assessed.   As a tool to help CCMs collectively prioritise obligations for assessment, the RBAF would complement audit points in providing clarity and transparency to the compliance monitoring process."
WCPFC19,369,"Tuvalu on behalf of FFA thanked the RBAF lead for her hard work over the 2-year period to progress the RBAF to this point. They stated that the RBAF should help streamline the CMS and it should help CCMs to select obligations, where non-compliance poses the greatest risk. FFA members supported adopting the RBAF recommended by TCC18 in order to help prioritize the list of obligations to be assessed under the CMS in the coming years. They encouraged CCMs to use the framework in their consideration of the list of obligations to be assessed in advance of the discussion of a list of obligations at TCC19 and stated FFA members would do the same."
WCPFC19,370,"The EU thanked the RBAF lead for her hard work. The EU noted that FFA had considered this a major element of the CMS, and observed that the CMR had been discontinued in part because of the absence of the RBAF, and stated that the initial intent was to avoid extensive negotiation on the list of obligations each year. Prior to this all CCMs had their own assessment framework. The EU stated that unfortunately the RBAF process had not achieved what was initially intended. The EU stated its hope that the results did not lead to a lot of additional work."
WCPFC19,371,"Australia thanked New Zealand for the work, which would provide a platform to better assess what obligations pose a risk, and the annual review process allows for streamlining the CMS process. It stated that the Secretariat had indicated there are ways to make the RBAF framework available, and stated its hope it could be used to expedite and streamline the CMS work in the future."
WCPFC19,372,"Tokelau, also on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau thanked both the RBAF and Audit Point Leads for their work.  They stated that progress in these two important areas as an important contribution to reforming the CMS. They supported the TCC recommendation and the FFA statement on the RBAF that view it as a useful tool for considering future lists of obligations to review during the CMR process. They also noted that because of the imbalance and bias in the monitoring coverage there may be some obligations that cannot be fairly assessed in the CMR process; in that case, these obligations would need to be excluded from the CMR."
WCPFC19,373,"WCPFC19 expressed its sincere appreciation to the Lead of the CMS-IWG work on the Risk Based Assessment Framework (RBAF), Heather Ward, for her hard work developing a RBAF. The Commission endorsed the RBAF as a useful tool that CCMs may use to guide their consideration of future lists of obligations to review during the Compliance Monitoring Report Review.  9.1.3 Develop Guidelines for Observer participation"
WCPFC19,374,"The TCC Vice-Chair stated that she developed a paper with the Secretariat (TCC18-2022-12) on observer participation, based on a TCC17 recommendation. That paper was reviewed at TCC18 (TCC18 Summary Report, paras. 64-84), but there was no agreement at TCC on the paper’s recommendations. She 67    noted that based on the comments received at TCC18 it appeared some members did not want to hold further discussions on observer participation until data are improved, and there is more balance in the number of obligations in longline and purse seine measures. She noted comments made by CCMs at WPCFC19 regarding this issue under Agenda Item 9.1, and stated she had no recommendations on how to progress the discussion."
WCPFC19,375,"The USA thanked the TCC Vice-Chair and the Secretariat for their work on this issue, and observed that the difference of opinion was not a new one. The USA noted that questions had been raised related to the measures the Commission had adopted for various fleets, and stated that differences in the required level of monitoring were being incorrectly assigned to the CMS. It stated that a failure by the Commission to adopt a balanced range of measures was not a flaw of the CMS. The USA stated it would work with other CCMs to provide that greater balance, but that characterizing the situation as a flaw of the CMS and using that as a reason for not increasing transparency, in the form of increased observer participation was misplaced. The USA also commented that CCMs had implied there were improprieties with respect to confidentiality or sharing of information. The USA stated it was unaware of any such issues in recent years, and stated that discussions had been held at TCC regarding measures that could be adopted to reduce the potential for such problems. It also noted that many CCM delegations already include outside stakeholders who can participate in the CMR process. The USA emphasised that the obligation to include observers had been agreed to by the Commission, and is included in the CMM. The USA observed that the Commission was overdue in taking action, noting that good progress had been made on the other elements, and expressed the hope that the Commission could make progress on this in 2023."
WCPFC19,376,"The EU stated that as indicated by the USA, participation of observers in all session of the Commission and subsidiary bodies is necessary to ensure transparency, and stated it was a requirement under the Convention. The EU stated that lengthy discussions on the issue in the past had suggested the that data confidentiality was the key problem, and at TCC18 it seemed some progress had been made on that issue. It noted the Secretariat prepared a very informative paper (TCC18-2022-12) showing that most of the data are already available in the public domain, meaning the risk from public disclosure is very low. The EU stated that CCMs had subsequently identified another area that seemed to be problematic, relating to the imbalance in observer reporting rates that result in a huge amount of data for purse seine fisheries, and less for the longline fleet. The EU stated that that there was scope to address that, and that the Commission could undertake to do so, but instead was simply not following up on the issue. The EU stated that when FFA members initially discussed the CMR review, three strands of work were to be undertaken, but one of these related to observer participation had been abandoned. The EU urged FFA members to reconsider, and follow-up on their commitment in this important issue."
WCPFC19,377,"Solomon Islands, on behalf of FFA members, stated that their views on this issue were captured in the TCC18 recommendations. They stated they would be prepared to consider the issue of observer participation in the CMS again when the current unfairness in the CMS is addressed. CMM 2021-03 on CMS paragraph 3 states that the implementation of the CMS and its associated processes shall be conducted in accordance with the principles of: effectiveness, efficiency, fairness and cooperation towards compliance. They stated that, as they had consistently stated, the CMS is flawed because of the imbalance between the information available for monitoring compliance between the longline and purse seine fisheries, which calls to question the principle of fairness required by the CMS measure. They stated that this was a consistent issue for FFA members for several years and one that the Commission needed to fix before considering the issue of observer participation. FFA members stated that a related issue is the fact that the dCMR raises potential compliance issues against CCMs, and that the classification of the dCMR as non-public domain data is aligned with the notion of “due process”, which needs to ensure that the interests of those identified in the dCMR are protected through to the Commission process that determines whether there has been compliance (or non-compliance) with specific obligations. FFA members stated they supported transparency and inclusivity but that the scheme and the process must be fair to all. They closed by 68    reiterating that they would be prepared to consider the issue of observer participation when the current unfairness in the CMS is addressed."
WCPFC19,378,"Korea stated it attaches much importance to transparency, and had seen a number of examples of meaningful contributions from observers, and anticipated further contributions. It supported participation by observers in principle provided no vessel-level information is discussed. Korea stated it looked forward to further discussions in 2023."
WCPFC19,379,"Tuvalu on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau stated they do not support opening the CMR process to observers because the CMS process remains deeply unfair and because of the confidentiality of much of the information used in the CMR.  They stated that they understand that the cause of these flaws is outside the CMS, but stated it deeply affects the fairness of the CMS outcomes, which means that great caution is needed to ensure that this basic unfairness is not compounded by opening up the prospect of this flawed information to being misused or misinterpreted outside the CMR. For these reasons, PNA and Tokelau stated they do not support opening the CMS process to observers. They stated they would be prepared to look at the issue again when the imbalance is fixed.  They welcomed CCMs working towards balancing the measures, such as adoption of the FFA’s ER proposal, to address the imbalance, rather than the circular argument they continue to have regarding the CMS."
WCPFC19,380,"PNG also on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau, stated that, as indicated at TCC18, they consider that much of the information used in the CMR is non-public domain data and should be kept confidential. They referenced paragraph 14 of the Data Rules, which stated that all types of data not described in paragraph 11 shall be referred to as non-public domain data. They stated that if paragraph 14 was meant to be limited to individual vessel and personal data, it would have said “all types of data relating to individual persons and vessels not described in paragraph 11 shall be referred to as non-public domain data”, but it makes no reference to data relating to individual persons and vessels. They stated that they fully understand that the Commission would have had in mind information beyond that relating to individual vessels and personal data when it decided that information such as that in the dCMR would be confidential. The dCMR includes comments by the Secretariat about the compliance of CCMs with particular obligations. It also includes the comments by CCMs in response. This information is part of a working discussion on compliance by CCMs and they stated that they expect that other CCMs would share their view that this information is confidential. They also considered that the discussion on this information as part of a working process should be confidential. For this reason, PNA and Tokelau stated that they consider that the dCMR should continue to be discussed in closed session to protect the confidentiality of the substantial volume of non-public domain data used in the CMR."
WCPFC19,381,"The Chair observed that the same positions were expressed at TCC18, and looked forward to constructive discussions to resolve the issue in the future."
WCPFC19,382,WCPFC19 was not able to reach agreement on the development of guidelines for observer participation.   9.1.4 Develop Corrective Actions
WCPFC19,383,"The Chair noted the advice of TCC18 (in WCPFC19-2022-26) related to the nomination of a Lead to develop corrective actions to encourage and incentivise CCMs’ compliance with the Commission’s obligations, where non-compliance is identified."
WCPFC19,384,The USA stated it nominated Ms Elizabeth O’Sullivan. 69
WCPFC19,385,"Samoa on behalf of FFA Members stated that they wanted to ensure that the scope of work on the issue was clear, and recommended that the first task for CCMs was to develop a clear TOR to guide the work.  FFA members advocated looking first at the use of cooperative and supportive actions as opposed to corrective actions, and stated they would be prepared to consider corrective actions once the current imbalance and bias in the CMS was addressed. They stated that this was in line with the principle of cooperation towards compliance, as stated in paragraph 3 of the CMS measure, to promote a supportive, collaborative, and non-adversarial approach where possible, with the aim of ensuring long-term compliance, including considering capacity assistance needs or other quality improvement and corrective actions."
WCPFC19,386,"WCPFC19 welcomed the nomination by the United States for Ms. Elizabeth O'Sullivan to lead work through the CMS IWG to develop corrective actions to encourage and incentivize CCM's compliance with the Commission's obligations, where non-compliance is identified, and encourages CCMs to participate in this work.   9.1.5 Review of Aggregate Tables"
WCPFC19,387,"The TCC Chair discussed WCPFC19-2022-CMS_Agg tables Proposed approach for the aggregate tables review process in 2023. He noted that a process was piloted at TCC17. He stated that although the aggregate tables were not considered at TCC18, he provided a paper (WCPFC-TCC18-2022-13) to TCC18 that described the review of the process in 2021 and sought guidance from CCM regarding what the review process could look like in the future. He stated that some constructive feedback was provided. He noted that most CCMs that provided feedback are of the view that the identification of anomalies should be a member-led and collective process. Concerns raised regarding neutrality can be addressed by defining a clear role for the Secretariat in presenting information and the Chair in presiding over the collective review of the aggregated tables in a fair and unbiased manner. He stated that the reframing of the purpose of the aggregated tables to focus initially on identification of anomalies and the suggestion of a phased approach was useful, and highlighted that the aggregate tables could be used to identify issues that warrant consideration without presupposing the cause of the issue, and that TCC has a clear role in discussing what the causes might be and how these can be addressed. He observed that differing views expressed regarding the application of a compliance status associated with the review of aggregated tables were not necessarily inconsistent, and noted the following points: i) Where TCC’s review of the aggregate tables clearly identifies a systemic failure on the part of a flag state to take action in response to infringements, CCMs may be supportive of having this recorded via a compliance status, but it is not clear how the application of a compliance status associated with a specific obligation in a specific reporting year would be applied or linked to a systemic issue across multiple years and/or multiple obligations; ii) There is no precedent for how TCC would make a determination of where an anomaly is associated with flag state failure and any corresponding threshold; iii) The opportunity to test the identification of anomalies and determination of causes by TCC19 will be an important part of aggregate tables review process. He stated that the implementation of a tracking tool for observer report requests is widely expected to lead to significant improvements in this issue which will help streamline the resolution of outstanding case file cases. Based on the feedback provided, the TCC Chair proposed a high-level approach for review of the aggregate tables at TCC19, provided an overview of key work to be undertaken up to and through TCC19 to WCPFC20, and proposed specific recommendations drawn from CCM feedback for WCPFC19 consideration and endorsement."
WCPFC19,388,"Palau on behalf of FFA members generally supported the proposed approach regarding recommendations relating to the high-level approach for aggregate tables review at TCC19, and suggested being cautious about putting a hard deadline against finalization of cases in the online CCFS, as this will would be dependent on a number of factors, with no specific date set in the CMM. However, they noted CCMs should be encouraged to try and resolve the cases as soon as possible and that the Secretariat can set 70    a deadline for drawing out the information for the aggregate tables. On the recommendations relating to the key work for 2023, they welcomed tasking the TCC Chair and the Secretariat to develop guidelines rather than a format for reporting against paragraphs 34(a) and 34(b) for outstanding cases. They reiterated their position to not focus on vessel-level cases but rather on review of aggregated information. In addition, they reiterated that compliance status be de-linked from the review of the aggregate tables, but stated their willingness to consider how the result of the review of the aggregate tables be reflected in the provisional and final CMR. Regarding the invitation to the Commission to provide advice related to the level of detail needed in observer reports to support investigations, FFA members noted that this would be case-dependent and any detail needed from the observer report would have to be in line with the ROP Minimum data fields."
WCPFC19,389,"FSM on behalf of PNA and Tokelau supported the statement by FFA, while noting they lacked the time to consider the paper as thoroughly as they would have liked. They attached high priority to making effective use of the aggregate tables in the manner anticipated in CMM 2021-03, while stating their deep concern regarding the highly biased results in most of the aggregate tables against the purse seine fishery and purse seine CCMs including PNA flag-state CCMs.  They stated that until that flaw was fixed, the aggregate tables affected by that imbalance should not be used to determine a compliance assessment outcome. They stated that fixing the effect of that imbalance was a key issue for TCC19 both in respect of the aggregate tables and more generally, and needed to be a specific element in any schedule of key work for 2023."
WCPFC19,390,"The EU broadly supported the workplan outlined and stated that the three key areas of work reflect quite accurately what needs to be done. Regarding the extension of observer reports tracking functionalities, the EU stated that it should be possible to identify open cases for which a report is required but not yet provided, so open cases, closed cases, and those for which no report had yet been received could be differentiated. Regarding the comment by FSM on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau, the EU stated that the TCC Chair mentioned some strands of work that could start to address this. One is related to the revision of the ROP observer forms, which were designed to serve scientific purposes but are also used for CMS purposes, and should be revised to reduce the risk of false positives, of which there are many. The EU stated that this could reduce the burden and hopefully address part of the imbalance issue that had been raised by many members."
WCPFC19,391,"RMI supported FSM’s comments, and stated the need to look at longline obligations on the high seas, stating that this is fundamental in the unfairness of the CMS process. RMI stated that the process was paused not because CCMs did not want a CMS, but because it needed to be fair. It stated that a number of proposals to address unfairness and data gaps had been forwarded, including increasing longline observer coverage, and ER. RMI stated it looked forward to developing robust CMS measure that looked at all obligations and what must be done collectively in the high seas."
WCPFC19,392,"The USA stated that the paper prepared by the TCC Chair was useful and outlined the issues that need to be considered. Regarding the issue of fairness and imbalance between purse seine and longline observer coverage, the USA stated that this has to be addressed not simply by TCC through a focus on the CMS, but more broadly by the Commission."
WCPFC19,393,"Tuvalu on behalf of PNA and Tokelau stated that at various points under Agenda Item 9, they had referred to the imbalance and bias in the CMS. They stated that for the benefit of CCMs who were not at TCC18 they would explain what they mean by those features, and how they affect the CMS. PNA and Tokelau stated they see the CMS as deeply flawed because of the difference in observer coverage, which provides much of the information for the CMS between the purse seine fishery (100%) and the longline fishery (5%). The effect of the difference in coverage is that almost all potential infringements in the purse seine fishery will be reported for issues monitored by observers, while almost none of the potential infringements in the longline fishery will be reported for those issues. They stated that this means, for 71    example, that the tables of reported shark-related potential infractions include virtually all of those incidents on purse seine vessels and almost none of those incidents on longline vessels. PNA and Tokelau stated that as a result, many of the conclusions of the CMS are deeply biased against the purse seine flag state CCMs and the purse seine fishery overall.  Because over 90% of the industrial purse seine fishery occurs in PNA waters and much of it is conducted by PNA flag state CCMs, this means that the CMS is deeply biased also against fishing in PNA waters and PNA members as flag states;  the bias favours longline flag state CCMs and fishing in international waters overall. This imbalance and bias deeply affect the CMS and the way in which results from the CMR and aggregate tables can be used. Within the limits of this bias, the Commission’s compliance processes can be used to identify compliance issues and encourage compliance in a positive and collaborative way. But the compliance process cannot be used for follow-up in terms of compliance scoring or actions that have any punitive implication. They stated that given the “one-eyed” compliance process, this would be completely unfair and PNA and Tokelau would not agree to the use of the compliance review processes in that way, and that is why TCC18 recommended that the Commission recognise the need to address this imbalance."
WCPFC19,394,"FSM on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau stated they also supported the proposed high-level approach for reviewing the aggregate tables at TCC19, as mentioned by FFA members. In particular, they supported the approach of CCMs notifying the Chair ahead of time of potential anomalies for discussion. On the scope of the tables, they stated that most of the tables are of relatively limited value at this present because of the effect of the observer coverage imbalance They stated that one way to strengthen the aggregate tables would be to include tables of limits and the reported levels of catch or effort against the limits, as these are Commission core business and don’t generally depend in observer data.  They advocated that this be included in the revision of the CMS CMM in 2023. On key work for 2023, they generally agreed with including a focus on the use of the Article 25 (2) tables because they are not affected by the observer coverage imbalance. They considered that both the static and the dynamic tables are needed for the reasons explained in the paper, while key work for 2023 must include fixing the effect of the observation imbalance both in respect of the aggregate tables and the CMS more generally, and requested that this be included. PNA and Tokelau stated they were not able to support a decision for the information on tracking of observer reports to be used in association with the aggregate tables. They stated that they were unsure that there is any documentation available yet on how the tracking of observer reports works, including how requests are made for observer reports and how information on the sending of observer reports is generated. They stated their understanding that in the current system, this information is provided by observer providers and with the CCFS enhancements this information will be provided by the flag state. They noted that improving the functionality of the CCFS on observer report tracking is included on the Secretariat’s programme for 2023, and suggested that the Secretariat be asked to provide a paper for TCC19 describing the process of tracking of observer reports requested and received, with any appropriate data, for review by TCC19. TCC could then review whether the way the data has been generated and collated is appropriate for consideration in conjunction with the aggregate tables. PNA and Tokelau stated that a key consideration would be whether the additional information on observer report tracking adds to or reduces the imbalance and bias in the CMS.  PNA and Tokelau agreed that work is needed on the level of detail in observer reports required to support investigations, but suggested this work be undertaken by the ROP-IWG as an extension of previous discussions on this issue in the ROP-IWG."
WCPFC19,395,"The EU thanked CCMs for clarifying their concerns relating to imbalance, and stated this is necessary to be addressed. The EU noted that 100% coverage in the purse seine fleet means there are about 300 vessels fully observed, as against about 150 in the longline fleet given 5% observer coverage. It stated that perhaps doubling coverage in the longline fleet to 10% would result in a roughly equal number of observed vessels, and could address the issue as a first step. It noted that 100% coverage of the longline fleet would require 3000 observers, which could prove very difficult to achieve, especially in the short term. The EU suggested looking at specific steps to address the concerns expressed by PNA and FFA members, and 72    stated that for purposes of the CMS the Commission could choose not to consider all the information from the ROP."
WCPFC19,396,"Kiribati stated that it appreciated the work by the Secretariat to enhance the CCFS in relation to the observer tracking tool. Kiribati noted discomfort with regard to the observer tracking tool process, noting that in the CMS the responsibility is for flag States to meet their responsibilities under Article 25. Kiribati raised the issue of observer safety related to transmission of observer reports via the CCFS. Kiribati suggested the flag state investigation process should be initiated through a flag state request for information approach.  Kiribati advocated delaying submission of observer reports via the CCFS."
WCPFC19,397,"New Caledonia stated that it was highly involved in the ROP, and met the requirement for 5% observer coverage and sought to reach 10%, but experienced challenges in terms of the required human resources. It encouraged each CCM to make progress in the area of human observer coverage in the WCPFC Convention Area."
WCPFC19,398,"RMI noted the EU’s comment, which illustrated the sheer extent of what needs to be done between purse seine and longline fleets to reach fairness in terms of the existing obligations. RMI stated that FFA members had a full suite of national and regional obligations. It stated that one approach to fairness would be to reduce the purse seine observer obligation. RMI stated that this was not its preferred approach, and expressed the hope the Commission would equalize the obligations for CCMs, particularly in the high seas."
WCPFC19,399,FSM stated that the agreed future work should include efforts to address the imbalance.
WCPFC19,400,WCPFC19 endorsed the proposed approach from the TCC Chair for the process to review aggregate tables in 2023 and the key work to be undertaken up to and through TCC19 and WCPFC20 (Attachment S).  9.1.6 Other future works
WCPFC19,401,The Chair stated that the Commission would consider other related reforms to enhance the CMS.  The TCC Vice Chair confirmed that there were no specific TCC18 recommendations for consideration under this agenda item.
WCPFC19,402,"Tonga on behalf of FFA members supported the TCC recommendations, in particular, the need for the Commission to address the imbalance between the information available for monitoring compliance between the longline and purse seine fisheries, noting this issue had been raised repeatedly, and called on the Commission to take action to address this imbalance."
WCPFC19,403,Tuvalu on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau stated they would be bringing proposals to TCC for reforms to the CMS to address the impacts of the imbalance on the CMS and looked forward to discussions on this important issue at TCC19.
WCPFC19,404,"RMI on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau stated they attach the highest priority to the TCC recommendation that the Commission recognises the need to address the imbalance between the information available for monitoring compliance between the longline and purse seine fisheries. They stated that the next step is for the Commission to take action to address the imbalance. They stated that in their view this would involve: (i) fixing the imbalance, in particular by strengthening monitoring of longline fishing, especially in the high seas, noting that the weakness in monitoring of longlining, especially in the high seas, continues to be the major weakness in the Commission’s management programmes; and (ii) noting that 73    fixing the imbalance would take time, they stated that actions should be taken to address the impacts of the imbalance on the fairness and scope of the CMS."
WCPFC19,405,The Chair noted the points expressed by CCMs related to future work on the CMS.
WCPFC19,406,"The Compliance Manager, in reflecting on the outcomes related to the CMS, noted the Secretariat’s workload for 2023, and observed 2023 would be a very busy year in terms of the work tasked to the Secretariat. She drew attention to WCPFC19-2022-IP18, which is the forecast of Secretariat’s work in support of the TCC workplan. She also noted WCPFC19-2022-FAC16-11, which addresses a proposal from the Secretariat to supplement the Secretariat’s Compliance team.  9.2 Consideration of Compliance Monitoring Report RY2021 and RY2022 in 2023"
WCPFC19,407,The Chair noted the advice of TCC18 concerning the consideration of the compliance monitoring reports for 2022 (covering 2021 activities) and 2023 (covering 2022 activities) in 2023 as contained in WCPFC19-2022-26; the Secretariat’s preliminary assessment of its anticipated work commitments to support work of TCC in 2023 and 2024 in WCPFC19-2022-IP18; the Side by Side Comparison of draft Audit Points and Secretariat dCMR Criteria in WCPFC19-2022-27; and the Information note on the status of the dCMR prepared by the Secretariat in 2022 for review by TCC19 in 2023 in WCPFC19-2022-33.
WCPFC19,408,WCPFC19 noted the Secretariat’s information note on the status of the dCMR prepared by the Secretariat in 2022 for review at TCC19 in 2023 (WCPFC19-2022-33).
WCPFC19,409,WCPFC19 agreed to continue in 2023 to require CCMs to submit their Annual Report Part 2 at least 100 days prior to TCC19 (which is a date in mid-June instead of 1 July).  9.2.1 List of obligations to be reviewed by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme in 2023
WCPFC19,410,"The Chair noted the advice of TCC18 on the list of obligations to be reviewed by the CMS in 2023 as contained in WCPFC19-2022-26, noting that this was also linked to the outcomes of the discussion on audit points under (Agenda Item 9.1.1)."
WCPFC19,411,"The EU advocated adopting a similar list of obligations for 2023 as was adopted for 2022, and advocated for introducing audit points for use in the 2024 CMR process (for the 2023 fishing season)."
WCPFC19,412,"Tokelau on behalf of FFA members supported the TCC18 recommendation to adopt the same list of obligations for review in both the 2022 and 2023 dCMR, recognising the increased workload which may be associated with reviewing two years of dCMR next year. They stated that using the same list should assist in a smooth and efficient review of both CMRs at TCC19 noting that a new list could make the review process at TCC19 more challenging and time consuming."
WCPFC19,413,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members thanked the Secretariat for WCPFC19-2022-27 Side by Side Comparison of draft Audit Points and Secretariat dCMR Criteria, noting that the paper shows that in comparing the audit points to criteria used by the Secretariat for the 60 obligations adopted by WCPFC18, 31 obligations are the same, 23 are mostly the same, 5 are different and 1 is new. They stated that this was a useful analysis, and inquired how much work would be needed if the Secretariat was to look again at the assessment made in the 2022 dCMR for the 23 obligations that are mostly the same and the 5 obligations that are different, and whether this would be achievable in 2023.  74"
WCPFC19,414,"The Compliance Manager noted there was a need to allow CCMs additional time to respond to issues, and stated that some CCMs had engaged actively, others less so. She stated that some issues would be forwarded to TCC irrespective of what happens with the audit points, and that much work would be required. Decisions would have to be made on whether the work this be done by CCMs and the Secretariat or TCC."
WCPFC19,415,WCPFC19 endorsed the list of obligations to be reviewed by the Compliance Monitoring Scheme in 2023 and noted it is the same list as adopted in 2022. (Attachment T)    AGENDA ITEM 10  — LIFTING OF TEMPORARY SUSPENSIONS OF OBSERVER COVERAGE OBLIGATIONS DUE TO COVID 19
WCPFC19,416,"The Compliance Manager introduced WCPFC19-2022-28 Updated Information related to the Resumption of Observer Placements. She noted with respect to recommencement of observer placements on purse seine vessels that the observer programmes had not reported significant issues in relation to their preparedness to support the resumption of 100% coverage of purse seine vessels from 1 January 2023. She noted that despite the loss of observers to other professions, feedback from observer programmes indicates the investment national observer programmes have continued to make in training and through some onshore work for observers has provided a good base level of preparedness for the progressive removal of the suspension of observer coverage for longline and purse seine fisheries and for transhipment. Efforts to re-deploy observers, and to recruit and train new observers in preparation for the resumption of deployments, have also served to offset the loss of observers to some extent. Some CCMs have retained some coverage through the use of their own observers, particularly for deployments between their own ports."
WCPFC19,417,"Japan noted the Secretariat’s presentation, but stated its concerns regarding the limited availability of flights which could constrain observers’ travel and achievement of 100% observer coverage on purse seine vessels as of 1 January 2023. Japan proposed a transitional period during which the coverage requirement would be ramped up."
WCPFC19,418,"FSM on behalf of FFA members reiterated that the intersessional decisions to extend the temporary suspension of observer coverage requirement since March 2020 had impacted the livelihood of Pacific Island observers and their families and led to a lack of vital scientific and MCS information during this period. They supported the decision made by the Special Session of the Commission to lift the temporary suspension related to placement of observers on carrier vessels during transhipment and the requirement for observer coverage on purse seine vessels by 1 January 2023. They noted the positive and steady improvement to the rate of observer coverage on receiving vessels during transhipment since July 2022 and stated this established a good basis for the recommencement of observer placement when this obligation becomes effective on 1 January 2023. FFA members stated they had prepared for the recommencement of observer coverage on fishing vessels, including by conducting refresher training for observers and developing COVID-19 safety protocols and an observer redeployment plan that provides the basis for safe redeployment and repatriation of observers on fishing vessels. They stated their readiness to recommence observer placements on fishing vessels by 1 January 2023 and noted they looked forward to working collaboratively with other CCMs to ensure the redeployment of observers takes places smoothly and safely."
WCPFC19,419,"New Zealand supported the comment made by FSM on behalf of FFA members, noting a Special Session of the Commission had already decided to resume observer coverage - the suspension was only ever intended to be a temporary situation.  New Zealand noted the Secretariat’s estimates of observer availability for transhipment, and stated that there had been plenty of time to prepare for resumption of these obligations. 75"
WCPFC19,420,"Chinese Taipei stated it had already contacted observer providers, and was pleased that observer providers were ready to deploy observers. It stated, however, that circumstances of CCMs differed, noting for example that one CCM could not attend WCPFC19 in person, and stated it was willing to consider Japan’s proposal to allow exceptional cases."
WCPFC19,421,"The USA stated it had used the time since the Special Session to begin resuming observer coverage, noting that currently over half of the US fleet is using observers, and that the American Samoa fleet would have 100% observer coverage by Jan 1, 2023."
WCPFC19,422,"The Compliance Manager stated that she had observed a real spirit of cooperation between flag states, agents and observer programs, and offered to assist flag states with concerns regarding resumption of observer coverage by potentially facilitating their making contact with observer programs."
WCPFC19,423,Japan stated it had held further discussions during WCPFC19 regarding the resumption of coverage and could support resumption of the purse seine coverage requirement in January 2023.
WCPFC19,424,WCPFC19 noted the positive progress that has been made in resuming the placement of observers on purse seine vessels during the transitional period of 15 June – 1 January 2023 (WCPFC19-2022-28).   AGENDA ITEM 11  — REPORTS FROM SUBSIDIARY BODIES AND WORKING GROUPS 11.1 SC18
WCPFC19,425,"The SC Chair, Dr. Tuikolongahau Halafihi (Tonga) reported on key issues not covered under other agenda items for the Commission’s consideration, as referenced in WCPFC19-2022-29_rev1 Reference Document on other SC18 recommendations for Agenda Item 11.1. He highlighted two recommendations requiring the Commissions attention, regarding data gaps and how a lack of consensus should be reflected in SC reports (paragraphs 2 and 136, SC18 Outcomes Document)."
WCPFC19,426,"The EU commented that regarding data gaps it supported the recommendations of SC18. In relation to the absence of consensus raised in paragraph 136 of the SC18 Outcomes Document, it stated that the issue was not really a disagreement on the stock assessment and its outputs, but centred on a disagreement over how to reflect them in the SC reports. It stated that some CCMs did not want to allow the others to express their views and resulted in being unable to provide management recommendations for skipjack at WCPFC19. The EU stated that it is essential to avoid politicization of the Commission’s scientific recommendations and noted that Article 11 of the Convention allowed for the expression of majority and minority views if consensus could not be reached. The EU strongly suggested that this approach be used, so that the situation that occurred at SC18 is not repeated."
WCPFC19,427,"Samoa on behalf of FFA members stated that, regarding the issue of absence of consensus, it is important to present information correctly under the appropriate heading. This is necessary in order to clearly distinguish scientific advice from management options and recommendations, and thereby bring clarity to discussions and negotiations."
WCPFC19,428,"Tokelau on behalf of the PNA welcomed discussion on the presentation of management advice on stocks by the SC, and stated that from its perspective the issue was about the clarity and integrity of the scientific advice. They stated that SC participants sometimes seek to include information about stock status 76    and trends in the management advice as if it implies certain management advice, and stated that in their view, this tends to cloud the nature of the scientific advice. They stated that if SC is providing advice to managers, that advice should be clearly stated and not implied."
WCPFC19,429,"The USA stated that a basic tenet of science is scientific integrity, and that it is important for SC to provide advice to the Commission. It stated that Article 11, paragraph 4 of the Convention allowed for majority and minority opinions to be expressed in the advice provided."
WCPFC19,430,"PNG on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau stated that in their view there was never an issue about whether differing views should be recorded or not, but that the difference was around where certain text should be placed in the report. They stated the same situation applied to the recording of differing views; these weren’t included simply because there was no agreement on where to place the record of those differing views, and participants were not prevented from recording their view."
WCPFC19,431,"RMI on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau stated they welcomed discussion on the presentation of management advice on stocks by the SC, and wanted to ensure that management advice from the SC is clearly stated and clearly understood. They stated that in their experience, the way in which some of the management advice is formulated has led to information on stock status and trends within the management advice being wrongly taken as advice or a recommendation. They stated their intent to continue to work towards ensuring the clarity and integrity of the management advice provided by the SC."
WCPFC19,432,"The EU noted that, in paragraph 136 of the SC18 Outcomes Document, SC was seeking guidance from the Commission. The EU stated that while CCMs may have differing views of what should be in one section or another section of the report, this should not prevent the SC from making its management advice. The EU stated that the views of CCMs cannot trump the text of the Convention, and stressed that Article 11 indicated how to deal with disagreements over what should be contained in reports."
WCPFC19,433,"Tokelau reiterated that there was agreement that the differing views should be recorded at SC, but there was not agreement regarding what part of the report these views should be in."
WCPFC19,434,"WCPFC19 endorsed the SC18 recommendation that the inclusion of tables of the operational level catch and effort data fields for longline, purse seine and pole-and-line gears, as a guideline and without the column of “binding” and adding the title of “Annex 2, guidelines for data submission of operational level catch and effort data fields for fisheries”, as an additional ANNEX of the “Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission”, with an additional paragraph under Section 3. Operational level catch and effort data as follows: “Annex 2 provides tables of the guidelines of operational level catch and effort data fields for longline, purse seine and pole-and-line gears in order to clarify and assist members in understanding the requirements of each data field and thereby facilitate the submission of data to the WCPFC.” (Attachment N)"
WCPFC19,435,"WCPFC noted paragraph 136 of the SC Outcomes Document, the guidance provided to subsidiary bodies is set out in Article 11(4) of the Convention, and how the views of CCMs are reflected in SC reports is a matter for the SC to determine."
WCPFC19,436,WCPFC19 adopted the Summary Report of SC18 (WCPFC19-2022-SC18) and endorsed the recommendations not covered under other agenda items (WCPFC19-2022-29 rev 1.) 77     11.2 TCC18
WCPFC19,437,The TCC Vice-Chair referenced WCPFC19-2022-30. Reference document for TCC18 recommendations for Agenda 11.2 and provided a brief overview of the TCC18 outcomes.
WCPFC19,438,"The Chair sought views on the TCC18 recommendations set out in WCPFC19-2022-30 related to IWG-ROP reactivation, RFV SSPs amendment, IT/VMS Security Audit and Scientific Data provision.  The Chair confirmed that the TS-IWG-related recommendations would be considered under Agenda 11.4.   Noting that there were no comments on these recommendations, the Chair requested views on other TCC18 recommendations not considered elsewhere in the agenda."
WCPFC19,439,"Vanuatu on behalf of FFA members thanked the TCC Vice-Chair for the report and supported the TCC18 recommendations not considered under other agenda items, but reiterated its position stated under Agenda 9.2 that FFA members are not supportive of an extra day for TCC19."
WCPFC19,440,"Tuvalu on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau supported the FFA statement, noting that as expressed at TCC18, they did not support an additional day for TCC19 for work on the CMS, noting their position is that the CMS is deeply flawed and of relatively little value, so it isn’t worth a lot of time. They stated that an additional day had already been added to TCC and that should be enough, especially with the audit points developed. They stated that in their view, the CMS for the two years can be completed in the time available at TCC19 if all CCMs participate efficiently."
WCPFC19,441,The Chair confirmed that no change would be made to the scheduled dates of the TCC19 meeting.
WCPFC19,442,"At the request of the Chair, the TCC Vice-Chair briefly introduced a paper recommending updates to the TCC Workplan 2022-2024 (WCPFC19-2022-34)."
WCPFC19,443,"New Zealand thanked the TCC Vice Chair for updating the workplan, and asked whether the review of the seabird mitigation measure should be in the workplan for 2023-2024, and noted that no further action in 2023 was proposed for the RBAF. The TCC Vice-Chair stated that with respect to seabirds the workplan could be updated intersessionally based on the outcome of WCPFC19, noting that no additional work was expected for RBAF in 2023, it did not need to be included."
WCPFC19,444,Tokelau on behalf of the PNA and Tokelau requested that Priority 5 relating to participation of observers in the CMS be deleted because there was no agreement on this work and be replaced with a new priority “Address the impact of the imbalance in observer information on the CMS.”
WCPFC19,445,"In response to a request from the Chair, the TCC Vice-Chair clarified that Agenda 9 CMS-IWG workplan discussions, were not reflected in the revised TCC workplan thus far."
WCPFC19,446,"In response to the PNA and Tokelau suggestion, the EU and USA requested that the work related to participation of observers be square bracketed, to reflect it had been paused, but be kept in the workplan, as it had been agreed to by the Commission in the CMM so should be retained in the workplan as a priority that should be addressed."
WCPFC19,447,"Tokelau indicated that although it was not their preference, they could accept the work related to participation of observers being square bracketed.  They explained that the issue is the sequencing.  If work to address the imbalance in observer information is completed, then the TCC could revisit the participation of observers in the CMS. 78"
WCPFC19,448,"The Chair, noting there were no further views, confirmed that the work related to participation of observers would be square bracketed in the updated TCC workplan."
WCPFC19,449,"WCPFC19 endorsed the following recommendations of TCC18: Tasking the Intersessional Working Group on the Regional Observer Programme (IWG-ROP) i TCC18 supported the Commission’s intention to reactivate the IWG-ROP.  ii TCC18 recommended that the Commission task the IWG-ROP, once it is reactivated, to develop draft recommended modifications to ROP data fields with the intention of allowing for more useful consideration of ROP data in the CCFS and in the Compliance Monitoring Scheme processes, and while taking into account their implications, including the impact on observer workloads and observer safety, as well as any related training needs.  iii TCC18 recommended that the IWG-ROP, once it is reactivated, prioritize work on issues such as a solution to identifying interactions with whale sharks and cetaceans, and on the inclusion of ROP data fields that were identified in the TCC Workplan 2022-2024 project specific task (j), and to identify any CMM that should also be prioritized in this work.  RFV Standards, Specifications and Procedures iv TCC18 recommended to WCPFC19 that the recommended edits in Box 1 in paragraph 6 of TCC18-2022-21 (Attachment 2) are adopted by the Commission. (draft TCC18 Summary Report paragraph 180 and Attachment E) (Attachment U, CMM 2022-05 Standards, specifications and procedures for the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Record of Fishing Vessels). WCPFC IT/VMS Security Audit v TCC18 supported the Secretariat’s recommendation to expand the annual VMS Security Audit budget, to include a more dynamic and continual assessment of the WCPFC information systems, with an estimated budget of $11,900 USD   (draft TCC18 Summary Report paragraph 236). vi TCC18 recommended to the Commission that an additional budget allocation of $15,000 USD be set aside for annual penetration testing of the WCPFC information systems (draft TCC18 Summary Report paragraph 237)."

WCPFC19,453,"Australia provided an overview of the status of ER&EMWG work in 2022, in response to the TCC workplan agreed at WCPFC18 (WCPFC19-2022-ERandEMWG-01 Summary of the work undertaken by the Electronic Reporting and Electronic Monitoring Working Group (ERandEM WG) in 2022). The workplan for 2022 was for TCC was to: i) Consider and provide advice on outputs from the ER&EMWG, including those related to existing obligations, data gaps and the prioritisation of ER and EM, and ii) Draft minimum standards for EM. TCC was also tasked to consider and provide advice on outputs from the ER&EMWG, including a draft EM CMM. In response to this workplan, the ER&EMWG achieved 3 main outcomes in 2022. Circulation of the current version of the SSPs in March with comments received from 11 participants. CCMs’ comments linked to how best to progress the drafting of EM SSPs and any associated CMM. In particular, some CCMs noted a difficulty in progressing the detailed drafting of the SSPs without broader understanding of the scope and application of any EM program in WCPFC. The EM Framework discussion paper sought to ensure that any EM framework recognised the precedents and decisions of Commission. It considered how members could implement EM and the potential interaction with the ROP. The discussion paper sought to find a way of balancing the needs of different members by providing a flexible way of implementing CMMs to give effect to the Commission’s requirements for at-sea monitoring for scientific and compliance purposes. In July, the EREMWG conducted a two-day virtual meeting. The key outcome was the working group’s agreement to concurrently develop in 2022 and 2023: (a) an At-Sea Monitoring CMM, (b) an EM program CMM, and (c) the associated SSPs in 2022 and 2023.These workstreams will form the basis of the ER&EMWG’s work in 2023. Australia noted that the various elements of work and progress on ER and EM among CCMs is extremely promising, and the need to improve reporting and monitoring of fishing activity within the WCPO remains a consistent theme in the Commission’s discussions. In particular, the Commission has collectively recognised the need to prioritise increased levels of reporting and monitoring in the high seas. This has also been addressed in parallel workstreams in the Commission, including the Transhipment IWG, the MCS provisions of various CMM proposals (including discussions regarding the tropical tuna measure), and ER initiatives. Australia also noted that the nominated Chair, Claire van der Geest, had left her role at the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, and that unfortunately, Australia was not in a position to continue chairing the ER&EMWG. It suggested that WCPFC19 provided an opportunity to transition the chair’s role to another CCM. Noting this, Australia stated it was in discussions with other CCMs regarding a potential nomination for a new chair. Australia stated it led the ER&EMWG beginning in 2015 and was proud of the significant achievements on both ER and EM development and implementation. Australia stated it continues to support and prioritise the development and implementation of robust monitoring within WCPFC and remains committed to continued engagement and progress in the ER&EMWG. Australia stated it looks forward to supporting a new chair to continue the successful work of the ER&EMWG."
WCPFC19,454,"FSM on behalf of FFA members thanked the Chair of the ER&EM WG for her effort to progress this work this year. They supported the proposed amendment from the fifth ER&EM WG meeting to the existing TCC workplan to support the timely progression of the Regional EM Programme. As stated under Agenda Item 4, FFA members shared with the Commission their EM SSPs through WCPFC19-2022-DP08 to be used as a basis to help progress the work on the development of EM SSPs by the ER&EM WG and with the aim of ensuring compatibility and complementarity of EM frameworks across the WCPFC Convention Area."
WCPFC19,455,"New Zealand stated that regarding ER, FFA members supported the recommendation from a majority of CCMs at TCC18 that the Commission agree that CCMs shall submit operational catch and effort 80    data in accordance with the agreed SSPs for ER in the WCPFC operational catch and effort data and observer data from 1st of January 2024. They noted that FFA members also tabled WCPFC19-2022-DP05, which was discussed at WCPFC19 through the ER SWG."

WCPFC19,459,"WCPFC19 agreed that those CCMs that cannot electronically report its catch and effort data in accordance with the agreed ‘Standards, Specifications and Procedures for Electronic Reporting in the WCPFC operational catch and effort data’ should report to TCC each year on any implementation issues."
WCPFC19,460,"WCPFC19 tasked SC19 and TCC19 to provide guidance to the Commission on how CCMs can provide operational catch and effort data to the Commission more frequently during the year. In particular, this guidance will consider CCMs’ implementation of data provision: a. within 30 days of the end of a trip and, where applicable, at the end of every transhipment at sea; and/or b. by 1 July and 31 December with available information for that calendar year.  11.4.2 Transhipment review (TS-IWG)"
WCPFC19,461,"WCPFC19 received a brief progress report from the Co-Chairs Alex Kahl (USA) and Felix Toa Ngwango (Vanuatu) of the Transhipment review IWG (TS-IWG) on the progress of the working group, as outlined in WCPFC19-2022-TS TS-IWG Co-Chairs’ report to WCPFC19 (28 November 2022.

WCPFC19,463,The Co-Chairs outline the recommendations as contained in WCPFC19-2022-TS.
WCPFC19,464,"RMI on behalf of PNA and Tokelau stated they had some concerns over Recommendation 4 regarding the IWG-ROP considering the FC-3 form and its data fields for inclusion on the ROP Minimum Standard Data Fields or as minimum data fields for observer transhipment monitoring, noting that this was due to the operational nature of placing observers, and their ability to follow-carrier through to port of unloading, once placed to observe a high-seas transhipment event. They asked the Secretariat whether their 81    understanding of the operational nature of observer placement is accurate? The Secretariat indicated it was. In response, RMI stated that in order to close out an important gap in the monitoring of high seas product movement, PNA and Tokelau reiterated their call at TCC18 to make FC-3 a carrier form to close out this gap and link the information to the data fields in Attachment 2 of WCPFC19-2022-32."
WCPFC19,465,"The Ocean Foundation, also on behalf of the Pew Charitable Trusts, stated their strong support for the workplan for the transhipment IWG. They noted that to draft a set of revisions of CMM 2009-06 for presentation at TCC19 would take a series of focused conversations and discussions as envisioned in the workplan. They noted their disappointment that in-person meetings could not be planned to progress that work prior to TCC, and called on all members to actively engage in the IWG's work during 2023 to meet the workplan's objectives. They stated that that they stand ready to support that work."
WCPFC19,466,"WCPFC19 noted with appreciation the report of the Co-Chairs of the TS-IWG and endorsed the following recommendations of the Co-Chairs (WCPFC19-2022-IWG-TS_rev2): i WCPFC19 adopted the Minimum data fields for Observer transhipment monitoring as listed in Attachment X as data fields to be collected by transhipment observers during transhipment events, as of 1 April 2023.  ii WCPFC19 agreed to amend the ‘Data fields’ item of the Agreed Minimum Standards and Guidelines of the Regional Observer Programme to read as follows:  “For transhipment on the high seas, transhipment ROP providers shall send the agreed ROP minimum standards data in forms FC-1 and FC-2 (Attachment X of WCPFC19 Summary Report) to the Commission Secretariat within 90 days of the disembarkation of the observer from the carrier.” iii WCPFC19 requested the Secretariat and Scientific Services Provider to provide a report to TCC19 and WCPFC20 on the outcomes of implementation of the short-term implementation phase (WCPFC19-2022-32, paragraphs 11-22). iv WCPFC19 requested TCC20 (after more than one year of implementation), and the IWG-ROP, consider the ROP data fields in FC-1 and FC-2 data fields and whether any revisions are necessary to the minimum data fields for Observer transhipment monitoring. v WCPFC19 recommended FC-3 form be referred to the TS-IWG and the IWG-ROP if it is reinitiated, to consider the data fields required to be collected by carrier vessels to complement the data to be collected by observers as referenced in Attachment X."
WCPFC19,467,WCPFC19 also endorsed the following recommendation of TCC18 related to ROP Minimum Transhipment Observer Data: i TCC18 noted the Commission has already adopted ER standards for observer data and that the development of standards for ER by transhipment observers or providers in 2023 could significantly shorten the required timeline for ER of transhipment observer data to the Secretariat.  82

The co-chairs highlighted the moral imperative of this work and their commitment to making progress along with CCMs in 2023.."
WCPFC19,470,"Niue on behalf of FFA members thanked the Co-Leads for their leadership during the intersessional period and at WCPFC19 to re-strategize the Commission's approach to the draft CMM.  They noted that improving crew labour standards and the passage of a binding CMM focussing on crew labour standards was a key priority for FFA members and had been identified by Pacific leaders as a focus area. They stated that a core principle for FFA members is the importance of their people. Niue stated that FFA members have adopted crew labour aspects into their harmonised minimum terms and conditions for access by fishing vessels to act on the need to protect crew. They stated that FFA members are encouraged by the engagement of CCMs through the intersessional period and look forward to continued commitment by all CCMs. However, FFA members expressed disappointment in the slow advancement of the draft CMM. They stated that the improvement of crew labour standards and elimination of human rights violations is a moral imperative, and that the Commission should continue the work on the draft CMM in 2023, including ensuring crew have their rights protected under law through contracts or other legal mechanisms. FFA members stated that further work would also be needed to address the most severe crimes such as forced labour, human trafficking and modern slavery, and stated they remained committed to continuing work through the IWG to progress this important task, with a view to having a binding CMM."
WCPFC19,471,"The USA joined with FFA members in thanking the Co-Leads.  It commented that it also views the issue as an imperative that be addressed by the Commission, and expressed disappointment that more progress had not been made. The USA stated it would like to see a commitment that this be completed in 2023, with a binding CMM."

WCPFC19,473,WCPFC noted with appreciation the Report of the Co-Leads of the Crew Labour Standards IWG and the importance that CCMs attach to progressing expeditiously a CMM on crew labour standards.   AGENDA ITEM 12  — ADOPTION OF THE 2023 IUU VESSEL LIST
WCPFC19,474,"The Chair noted reference paper WCPFC19-2022-31, which includes the recommendations of TCC18 on this issue. She stated that the proposed 2023 IUU Vessel List is the same IUU Vessel List for 2022."
WCPFC19,475,"Nauru on behalf of FFA members supported the retention of NEPTUNE, FU LIEN No.1 and YU FONG 168 on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2023. They thanked Chinese Taipei for responding to the 83    questions they had raised concerning beneficial ownership during TCC18 and stated they would respond to those comments at TCC19. As was agreed at WCPFC17, FFA members recommended that the Executive Director be tasked accordingly to continue to follow up with the former flag States, CCMs, and RFMOs (WCPFC17 Summary Report, paragraph 388)."
WCPFC19,476,"Vanuatu provided an update on information presented by Vanuatu at TCC18 regarding two foreign fishing vessels conducting fishing activities in Vanuatu waters without licences, which was ongoing at that time. Vanuatu thanked FFA, SPC, WCPFC and the French government for their support in ensuring that the matter be heard in court. The fishing vessels entered Vanuatu waters without notice or valid licences between December 2020 and January 2021 and carried out fishing activities until they were apprehended with the help of PMW Patrol Boat RVS Tukoro and brought to port. All crew were apprehended and underwent COVID-19 protocols before being held in custody. Court proceedings commenced in July 2022. Evidence provided included video footage, expert witness statements, photographs, defendants’ inconsistent statements, and an absence of fishing vessel devices and licences. The Supreme Court issued a verdict of not guilty on all charges on 29 July. The Supreme Court ruled that fishing activities were recreational in nature and that fishing gear was stored in a manner not ready to be used. The Office of the Public Prosecution filed an appeal application, which was accepted. The Court of Appeal convened in November and ruled that the Defence Counsel and Supreme Court judge had erred in their judgement and interpretation of the law regarding fishing. The Court of Appeal ruled for a retrial and that the matter be brought before the Supreme Court again. Vanuatu stated that the outcome to date was positive, but stated it wished to draw the attention of WCPC19 to the issue of how well-versed CCMs’ respective judiciaries are with respect to fisheries or maritime related matters. It noted that significant work was needed to educate the public and agencies (e.g., the police, judiciary, education system, industry and the general population) regarding fisheries-related matters and the need to protect and sustainably use these resources. It stated that such undertakings may be the sole responsibility of each CCM’s national government based on advice and guidance from national fisheries agencies, and regional and international fisheries organisations. It commended FFA’s efforts to organize regional judicial meetings, whereby judges and lawyers meet for a week to discuss fisheries-related matters, and develop familiarization with regional fisheries work, data, surveillance and enforcement, and evidence. It stated that this was a good initiative for all CCMs to adopt and implement nationally with some guidance from their regional and international partners. With respect to the case in question, Vanuatu stated it is fortunate and grateful that the Court of Appeal ruled in the State’s favour, and called for a retrial. However, it stated its concern that the case proved difficult due to a lack of understanding regarding fisheries, legislation and policies, and evidence. As a consequence, Vanuatu put forward the following recommendations, which it stated could help CCM’s judiciaries and people to better understand fisheries resource management and sovereignty, sovereign rights, and associated concepts: i) Awareness on fisheries and related matters should be developed at national level with other relevant government agencies, members of the judiciary, border and enforcement, security, finance, health, labour, communications, education, NGOs and donor partners; ii) The Commission and CCMs should discuss and deliberate on the issues surrounding entry and exit of EEZs and most importantly, expand on certain language such as “Loitering”; and consider what measures should be imposed at the national level where foreign fishing vessels loiter in an EEZ without a valid license or good reason; and iii) Fisheries-related material should be introduced into the government education system, with media encouraged to ensure people are familiar with fisheries management matters; awareness programs should explain what fisheries management constitutes, and address the importance of fisheries resource management activities and the fight against IUU fishing activities in CCMs’ waters."
WCPFC19,477,WCPFC19 agreed to maintain the three vessels currently on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List and adopted the 2023 IUU Vessel List. (Attachment Z)  84     AGENDA ITEM 13  — REPORT OF FAC16 13.1 Report of the Sixteenth Finance and Administration Committee

WCPFC2,18,"In accordance with Articles 23 and 32 of the Convention, the Chair invited Commission Members to provide reports on their progress in implementing the Convention. Articles 23 and 32 of the  3Convention also require reports to record implementation of any conservation, management or other measures that are agreed on. Because the Commission has not yet agreed on any such measures, Members reported on current management measures in place in national jurisdictions. Statements were made by Chinese Taipei, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Tokelau and Fiji.  Statements of Cooperating Non-members"
WCPFC2,19,The Chair invited Cooperating Non-members to provide a report as described in Articles 23 and 32 of the Convention. Statements were made by the United States of America and Indonesia.  Statements by Observers

AGENDA ITEM  5 —  SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE REPORT  Report of the First Regular Session of the Scientific Committee"
WCPFC2,21,"Dr SungKwon Soh (Chair of the Scientific Committee, Korea) presented the summary outcomes of the First Regular Session held in Noumea from 8–19 August 2005. He highlighted that the Scientific Committee had addressed the requests for advice on conservation and management measures presented in the Resolution on Conservation and Management Measures adopted at the Inaugural Session of the Commission (as detailed in Annex II of the Summary Record of the Inaugural Session), including: • estimates of sustainable catch and effort levels for bigeye, yellowfin and South Pacific albacore;  • biomass projections for bigeye and yellowfin tuna relative to 2003 catch and effort levels, including the effects on stocks of time/area closures; •  investigation of measures to mitigate the catch of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna, including controls on setting on floating objects; • estimates of the mortality of non-target species with an initial focus on seabirds, turtles and sharks; and  • data and other issues requiring consultation between the Scientific Committee and the Technical and Compliance Committee.    The Scientific Committee also discussed:  • the data requirements of the Commission, • the submission of data to, and data dissemination by, the Commission,  • collaboration with the Technical and Compliance Committee regarding data collected by the observer programme, • data management and data security, • the independent review of the transitional scientific structure and functions that would examine the effectiveness of the science structure of the Commission by June 2007, and  • the Indonesia and Philippine Data Collection Project (IPDCP).    4 Response to the Resolution on Conservation and Management Measures"
WCPFC2,22,"Dr Soh presented the Scientific Committee's response to requests for advice from the Inaugural Session of the Commission, as detailed in the Resolution on Conservation and Management Measures."
WCPFC2,23,"The Commission noted:  • Despite the 1999 PrepCon/MHLC Resolution on exercising reasonable restraint on capacity, the Report of the First Regular Session of the Scientific Committee indicated that effort and fishing capacity in the Convention Area continued to expand; • A reduction in the use of fish aggregating devices and floating objects appeared to be the most effective method of reducing bycatch of juvenile bigeye tuna; • Although the level of observer coverage required for collecting adequate data for estimating the mortality of non-target species varies among species and from fishery to fishery, rarer species require a higher level of coverage. Some experts suggested that 20% observer coverage was a reasonable target for purse seine operations and at least 10% for longline operations; • The level of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean was a significant factor in preventing accurate estimates of catch and effort levels for regional tuna fisheries, and for developing appropriate advice in respect of conservation and management measures; • The issue of uncertainty associated with the Scientific Committee's assessments and analyses related to species identification, particularly with respect to juvenile bigeye tuna and the lack of comprehensive information for fisheries in Indonesia and the Philippines.  This impacted on the degree of confidence that could be provided for long-term forecasts of the status of regional tuna stocks;  • There is potential for significant fishing impacts on the adult component of the South Pacific albacore stock, and catch rates, if fishing effort is increased. This is due to the way in which the stock is fished (larger, older fish are taken rather than juveniles), despite the high degree of resilience (in biological terms) in the stock overall;  • Fishing mortality for bigeye tuna is divided evenly across longline and other gear types, and between catches from the high seas and areas under national jurisdiction; • Current assessments presented in the Report of the Scientific Committee represent the best information available and, given the commitment to a precautionary approach, the Commission was urged to take the assessments into account in formulating future conservation and management measures.  Advice and recommendations of the Scientific Committee to the Commission"
WCPFC2,24,"Dr Soh presented the recommendations and advice of the Scientific Committee to the Commission. These recommendations related to scientific data to be provided to the Commission, the review of the Indonesia and Philippines Data Collection Project, standards for the provision of operational level catch and effort data to the Commission, the management and dissemination of this data, observer scientific data requirements, activities for support under the Special Requirements Fund, the relationship between the Scientific Committee and the Technical and Compliance Committee regarding the observer programme, the appointment of Specialist Working Group conveners and the terms of reference for an Independent Review scheduled for the first half of 2007."
WCPFC2,25,The Scientific Committee recommended that Dr Shelton Harley (New Zealand) be appointed as Vice Chair of the Scientific Committee.   5
WCPFC2,26,"The Commission adopted the Report of the First Regular Session of the Scientific Committee and its recommendations, subject to budgetary considerations.  Work programme for the Scientific Committee in 2006"
WCPFC2,27,"In accordance with Article 12 of the Convention, Dr Soh presented a draft work programme for 2006 for the Scientific Committee. This work programme was adopted by the Commission as part of the Scientific Committee Report, noting any additional requests made by the Commission during its discussions."
WCPFC2,28,"The Commission noted that, as the position of Chair of the Scientific Committee would fall vacant early in 2006, a new Chair would be appointed at its Second Regular Session. In the interim it was agreed that Dr Harley would work with the Secretariat to prepare for the Second Regular Session of the Committee."
WCPFC2,29,"Dr John Hampton (Secretariat of the Pacific Community) reported on plans for a regional tuna tagging programme that will be initiated in the waters under the jurisdiction of Papua New Guinea. He noted that, as the project could be extended to the broader Convention Area, the Commission may wish to establish a steering committee to oversee the project. The European Community, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand contributed significant financial support to the project to date.  AGENDA ITEM  6 —  ADOPTION OF CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES  Conservation and management measures"
WCPFC2,30,"Concern was expressed over the short time frames available for consideration of draft resolutions. The Commission agreed in good faith that, despite Rule 20 of the Rules of Procedure that requires 24 hours notice, Members would try to submit draft proposals 30 days prior to the Annual Session of the Commission in order to allow all Members adequate time for consideration and consultation."
WCPFC2,31,"The Chair confirmed that the USA and Indonesia, as original members of the Multilateral High-level Conference (MHLC) and Preparatory Conference processes, and as Cooperating Non-members, were eligible to submit draft proposals and participate in the debate within the Commission, but they could not participate in decision-making."
WCPFC2,32,The Commission made the decision to adopt the following: • Conservation and management measures for bigeye and yellowfin tuna in the western and central Pacific Ocean (Attachment D).   • Conservation and management measures for South Pacific albacore (Attachment E); • Conservation and management measures for North Pacific albacore (Attachment F); • Resolution on the reduction of overcapacity (Attachment H); • Resolution on the incidental catch of seabirds (Attachment G); • Resolution on non-target fish species (Attachment I); and • Resolution to mitigate the impact of fishing for highly migratory fish species on turtles (Attachment J).
WCPFC2,33,"In relation to the measures on North Pacific albacore and South Pacific albacore, it was agreed that the Commission would review these decisions at the Third Regular Session in 2006. The Commission instructed the Scientific Committee to give priority to developing a stock assessment for  6South Pacific albacore for consideration in this review. Pending the results of this review, and any additional advice provided by the Scientific Committee, Members, Cooperating Non-members and participating territories (CCMs) were urged to exercise restraint with respect to increased fishing for this stock in the Convention Area."
WCPFC2,34,"With the adoption of the Resolution on the reduction of overcapacity, Chinese Taipei made a commitment to cooperate with Japan and other concerned Members to implement the Resolution reiterating that the implementation of the Resolution would not prejudice the interests of its legitimate licensed purse seiners."
WCPFC2,35,"In relation to the Resolution on seabirds, the Commission agreed that the Scientific Committee should take the practical steps necessary for improving the recording and monitoring of seabird interactions, including species involved and rates of total mortality in the Convention Area. The Technical and Compliance Committee should monitor the progress of CCMs in applying this resolution and report to the Commission and develop relevant strategies for further consideration of the Commission."
WCPFC2,36,"The Commission agreed that the Scientific Committee, in consultation with the Technical and Compliance Committee, should investigate seabird mitigation measures applied and tested by other regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), particularly those of the Commission for Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources; investigate the utility of implementing compatible measures; and recommend specific seabird mitigation measures for consideration at the Third Regular Session of the Commission."
WCPFC2,37,"In relation to the Resolution relating to sea turtles, it was agreed that the Commission, through the Scientific Committee and the Technical and Compliance Committee, should develop a programme that includes researching and developing gear and bait alternatives; promoting the use of available bycatch mitigation technology; promoting and strengthening data collection programmes to obtain standardized information for developing reliable estimates of sea turtle bycatch; biological research on sea turtles, including the identification of migration routes or other areas of spatial or temporal importance; industry education, development and promotion of safe handling techniques and other techniques to improve sea turtle conservation. This programme will take into account the sea turtle conservation efforts undertaken in other international organizations, in particular the IATTC."
WCPFC2,38,"The Commission requested that the Secretariat, in cooperation with the Scientific Committee, centralize bycatch and observer data to obtain better estimates of total catch and mortalities of sea turtles by fisheries that target highly migratory fish species covered by the Convention within the Convention Area.  The Scientific Committee is requested to take practical steps necessary to improve monitoring and reporting of sea turtle interactions in the Convention Area, including the development of data standards and, specifications and reporting requirements."
WCPFC2,39,"The Commission agreed to task the Executive Director with producing a discussion paper on allocation issues within WCPFC for circulation to Commission Members in advance of the Third Regular Session of the Commission. While leaving it to the Executive Director to develop the necessary Terms of Reference for the development of the paper, the Commission considered it would be useful for this paper to include the following elements: • Overview of relevant provisions on international law relating to allocation of access to fisheries resources, including the rights and obligations of coastal states, flag states, fishing states and the role of RFMOs; • Overview and assessment of the experience of other RFMOs, particularly tuna RFMOs, in addressing allocation;  7• Analysis and discussion of the factors listed in Article 10(3) of the Convention relating to allocation criteria; • Discussion of potential models for allocation within WCPFC; and  • Outline of potential processes for the Commission to make progress on allocation."
WCPFC2,40,"The Commission agreed to defer discussion of the issue of regulating transshipment until the Second Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC), at which time a more comprehensive strategy will be developed incorporating longline and other vessels. It was agreed that a draft proposal prepared by Australia and the Philippines would be used as the basis for further consideration of transshipment (Attachment K)."
WCPFC2,41,"The Commission noted that a large proportion of purse seine landings are conducted in non-member countries, in particular Thailand, and the Commission agreed that the Executive Director shall write to the relevant authorities seeking cooperation from such non-members."
WCPFC2,42,"In accordance with Article 29(5) of the Convention, the Commission agreed to exempt the Philippines from the prohibition on transshipping at sea by purse seine vessels for a period of 12 months, until procedures for transshipment are agreed on at the Third Regular Session of the Commission."
WCPFC2,43,"Also in accordance with Article 29(5), the Commission agreed to grant exemptions to all FFA countries currently engaging in purse seine transshipment at sea in waters under national jurisdiction for a period of 12 months, until procedures for transshipment are agreed on at the Third Regular Session of the Commission."
WCPFC2,44,"Noting the concerns expressed by a number of Members relating to the proposal only requiring the documentation of traded products rather than all catch, the Commission agreed to defer consideration of a proposal for the adoption and implementation of a statistical documentation scheme as set out in (WCPFC/Comm2/DP03 Rev.1) for bigeye tuna. The Commission agreed that concerned members should work intersessionally with Japan to develop a more comprehensive scheme covering all catch for consideration at the Third Regular Session of the Commission."
WCPFC2,45,The Commission agreed to defer consideration of the shark conservation resolution as set out in WCPFC/Comm.2/DP21.Rev1 until the Third Regular Session of the Commission.
WCPFC2,46,"The Commission agreed to defer consideration of swordfish management measures for the southwest Pacific until the Third Regular Session of the Commission in 2006, and requested that the Scientific Committee provide additional advice on the status of the southwest Pacific swordfish stock at this meeting to enable the Commission to take a decision. The Commission urged all Members to exercise reasonable restraint in expanding fishing effort on the southwest Pacific swordfish stock, particularly with respect to establishing a catch history in anticipation of the adoption of conservation and management measures. The Commission asked interested Members to meet informally and discuss the issue in February in New Zealand.  AGENDA ITEM 7 —  NORTHERN COMMITTEE  Report of the First Regular Session of the Northern Committee"
WCPFC2,47,"Mr Masanori Miyahara (Chair of the Northern Committee, Japan) presented the summary outcomes of the First Regular Session of the Northern Committee, which met on 12 December 2005 in  8Pohnpei. The meeting had considered Secretariat functions, management measures for North Pacific albacore and the Committee’s relationship with other organizations."
WCPFC2,48,"  It was clarified that the International Scientific Committee (ISC) will liaise with the Scientific Committee in relation to scientific advice for northern stocks. The Commission adopted the Report of the First Regular Session of the Northern Committee, including a revised Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the ISC and the Commission. It was noted that the independent review of scientific services to the Commission in early 2007 would examine options for securing scientific advice for all tuna stocks of interest to the Commission.  Advice and recommendation of the Northern Committee to the Commission"
WCPFC2,49,Mr Miyahara presented a recommendation from the Northern Committee on conservation and management measures for North Pacific albacore stocks. This was subsequently adopted by the Commission (see paragraph 32 and 33 above).
WCPFC2,50,The Northern Committee will hold its next meeting in Japan from 11–13 September 2006.    AGENDA ITEM 8 — TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE ISSUES  Report of the First Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee
WCPFC2,51,"Mr Apolosi Turaganivalu (Chair of the Technical and Compliance Committee, Fiji) presented the summary outcomes of the First Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee meeting held in Pohnpei from 5–9 December 2005. He highlighted the Technical and Compliance Committee’s (TCC) consideration of annual reporting requirements by Members to the Commission, the development of a template for the preparation of Annual Reports, discussions relating to the Record of Fishing Vessels and Authorizations to Fish and confirmation of the monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) priorities for the Commission. These were identified as the Commission’s vessel monitoring system (VMS), the regional observer programme, high seas boarding and inspection, port State measures and transshipment.  The TCC also considered technical matters associated with the implementation of conservation and management measures that might be considered by the Commission, as had been requested at the Inaugural Session of the Commission."
WCPFC2,52,"The TCC requested that the Secretariat undertake further work during 2006 in respect of the Commission’s VMS, including a cost assessment and feasibility study of two options identified as offering the best potential to meet the Commission’s needs. In relation to the regional observer programme, the TCC recommended bringing forward the recruitment of the Observer Programme Coordinator to mid-2006.    Response to the Resolution on Conservation and Management Measures"
WCPFC2,53,"Mr Turaganivalu outlined the response of the TCC to the request from the Inaugural Session of the Commission for advice on technical issues associated with the implementation of conservation and management measures that might be adopted by the Commission (Attachment H to the Summary Record of the First Regular Session of the TCC). The TCC noted that while the Commission had not yet adopted conservation and management measures, a functional VMS and operational observer programme were two key MCS components that would be required to support any conservation and management measures adopted by the Commission.     9Advice and recommendations of the Technical and Compliance Committee to the Commission"
WCPFC2,54,Mr Turaganivalu presented the recommendations of the TCC to the Commission. The Commission adopted the recommendations that had been agreed by consensus by the TCC.
WCPFC2,55,"  The Commission noted that although the differentiation of fishery management between EEZs and high seas in the Pacific Islands region was controversial in the past, consistent management and VMS monitoring through EEZs and high seas areas are desirable. The Commission considered the possibility that the FFA Secretariat could provide the interim service of the VMS system covering both EEZ and high seas in the Pacific Islands region until a decision is made regarding the structure and operation of the Commission’s high seas VMS."
WCPFC2,56,"  The Commission noted that the fishing activity in the North Pacific was significantly different from that in the South Pacific in that there is extensive activity operating in the disputed zones between Japan, Korea and China. As a result, it was noted that this situation would impact the application of the same VMS in the North and South Pacific and was an issue that needed to be considered in the development of the Commission’s VMS."
WCPFC2,57,"In relation to the regional observer programme, the Commission agreed to proceed with the hybrid option recommended by PrepCon Working Group 1 and identified in WCPFC/TCC1/14, also taking into account transshipment observer programmes of other tuna RFMOs, and requested the Scientific Committee and the Technical and Compliance Committee to begin developing a work programme for its implementation."
WCPFC2,58,"The Commission agreed that early consideration would be given to improving observer coverage in the Convention Area, particularly in relation to longline fishing and fishing on the high seas, noting that inter alia, observer safety, vessel size and costs are important considerations in improving observer coverage."
WCPFC2,59,"In relation to high seas boarding and inspection, the Commission took note of the provisions of Article 26 of the WCPF Convention, which require that if boarding and inspection procedures are not developed within two years of entry into force of the Convention (which will be on 19 June 2006), then Articles 21 and 22 of the Agreement apply. The Commission recognized that, although significant progress was made in PrepCon Working Group III in developing procedures for high seas boarding and inspection, there was not sufficient time to reach agreement on these procedures in advance of the Second Regular Session of the Commission. As a result, per Article 26(2), Articles 21 and 22 of the Agreement will apply as of 19 June 2006, until the adoption of a specific boarding and inspection scheme when and if the Commission agrees to such a scheme."
WCPFC2,60,"However, noting that the practical application of Articles 21 and 22 of the Agreement would require the elaboration of additional measures and procedures, such as the development of appropriate domestic legislation, authorization of high seas boarding and inspections, notification of the form of identification issued to authorized inspectors, designation and publicity of the appropriate domestic authority to issue such notifications, and the development by the Commission of a process for receiving and publishing duly authorized inspectors and documenting the credentials of such inspectors and other information that has been submitted to the Commission, the Commission decided that the boarding and inspection procedures in Article 21 and 22 of the Agreement should not be utilized until these matters have been discussed intersessionally, and resolved at the Third Regular Session of the Commission."
WCPFC2,61,The Commission approved a recommendation from the TCC to establish an intersessional working group in accordance with the terms of reference found in Attachment G of the Report of the First Regular  10Session of the TCC to be convened by Mr William Gibbons-Fly (United States of America). It was agreed that this working group would meet as part of TCC2 in 2006.   Work programme for the Technical and Compliance Committee in 2006
WCPFC2,62,"In accordance with Article 14 of the Convention, the Chair of the Technical and Compliance Committee presented a draft work programme for 2006 for the Technical and Compliance Committee for consideration in the formulation of the Commission’s 2006 Work Programme and Budget.   AGENDA ITEM 9 — EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT  Annual Report of the Executive Director"
WCPFC2,63,"In accordance with Rule of Procedure 13, the Executive Director delivered his Annual Report for 2005.  AGENDA ITEM 10 — ADMINSTRATION ITEMS  Issues arising from WCPFC1"
WCPFC2,64,"The Commission noted that the issues outlined in the Annex to WCPFC/Comm.2/11 had either been addressed intersessionally or would be addressed during WCPFC2. New Zealand drew the Commission’s attention to WCPFC/PrepCon5/34 paragraph 39, which provides that it is the responsibility of the Contracting Parties concerned, rather than the Commission, to develop guidelines relating to voluntary contributions for participating territories.  Report on accounts for 2005"
WCPFC2,65,The Executive Director provided a report on the Commission accounts for 2005 as outlined in WCPFC/Comm.2/13. He noted that assessed contributions received by the Secretariat as of 30 November amounted to 47% of projected 2005 income from Members. He appealed to Members to make their 2005 payments before the end of the year. He advised that an audit will be undertaken in February 2006 and the result would be circulated to Members by 31 March 2006. There was suggestion that pending contributions from Members should be shown on the balance sheet as receivables.  Auditor’s report for 2004
WCPFC2,66,"Noting the Commission had not managed any funds in 2004, the Commission adopted the auditor’s report of the Preparatory Conference Organisational Fund (PCOF) that had been circulated to all Members by the Forum Fisheries Agency, as administrator of the PCOF, in February 2005.   Report on the collection of contributions and advances to Working Capital Fund"
WCPFC2,67,The Commission noted there was no report on the Working Capital Fund (WCF) as no advances had been credited to the account during 2004 or 2005.  Report on the status of the Special Requirements Fund
WCPFC2,68,"The Executive Director reported that, following contributions from the Federated States of Micronesia and the United States of America, the balance for the Special Requirements Fund, as of 30 November 2005, was US $35,000.   11"
WCPFC2,69,FFA members encouraged all CCMs to contribute to the Special Requirements Fund.  Appointment of external auditor
WCPFC2,70,The Commission agreed to appoint Deloitte Touche as the Commission’s auditor for a period of two years.   Financial regulations
WCPFC2,71,"The Commission noted that the correct version of the Financial Regulations, as agreed to at the Final Preparatory Conference, had now been circulated.    Staff establishment"
WCPFC2,72,"The Commission considered a paper prepared by the Secretariat relating to staff establishment and services. The Commission noted that it is the responsibility of the Executive Director to manage Secretariat functions cost-effectively and to report with full transparency to the Commission, rather than requiring administrative decisions from the Commission. Furthermore, it was noted that regional balance should be taken into account when hiring staff."
WCPFC2,73,"The Commission considered the structure as proposed, and agreed to defer a decision on the establishment of a permanent legal post within the Secretariat until the Third Regular Session of the Commission. The Commission also encouraged the Executive Director to outsource secretariat services as much as possible.   Staff regulations"
WCPFC2,74,"The Commission adopted the draft Staff Regulations prepared by the Secretariat, as amended."
WCPFC2,75,"The representative from FFA suggested that, as there are triennial reviews of the Council of Regional Organisations of the Pacific (CROP) employment conditions, the Commission’s Staff Regulations should be reviewed following the completion of these reviews to ensure the provisions remain as harmonized as possible.  Accommodation options for Commission staff"
WCPFC2,76,"The Commission recommended that the Executive Director continue to explore options for providing for the accommodation needs of the Secretariat’s staff. It was agreed that the Executive Director would write to Members in late February 2006, informing them of the outcomes of approaching local landowners to construct accommodation for Commission staff. If no progress had been made, the Executive Director would invite Members to make voluntary contributions to a Housing Fund that could be used to erect accommodation on vacant land that he would secure under long-term lease arrangements.   2006 Work Programme and Budget"
WCPFC2,77,The Commission adopted the 2006 budget and work programme appended as Attachment L.
WCPFC2,78,"The Commission agreed to carry forward un-expended funds from 2005 for use in the budget in 2006. Because this would mean that the Commission would function throughout 2006 without a Working  12Capital Fund (WCF), it was agreed that the indicative budget for 2007 should provide for a levy of 10% of assessed contributions that would be dedicated to the re-establishment of the WCF."
WCPFC2,79,"The Commission also noted that 2005 assessed contributions would not meet budget because Canada, Palau and Vanuatu were eligible for reduced payments as a result of their ratification of the Convention late in 2005 and the fact that Indonesia and the United Kingdom were unlikely to make contributions as they were not Members during 2005."
WCPFC2,80,The Commission noted that the budget would need to incorporate Pohnpei State sales tax as the National Government of the Federated States of Micronesia had not been in a position to waive this requirement as part of the Headquarters Agreement. It was noted that the National Government was seeking a review of this with the Pohnpei State Government.   AGENDA ITEM 11 — COOPERATING NON-MEMBERS  Applications for Cooperating Non-members
WCPFC2,81,"The Commission agreed to defer a decision on the Cooperating Non-member status of Belize until the Third Regular Session of the Commission. The Commission requested that the Executive Director write to the Government of Belize advising them of the Commission’s decision and of the issues that Belize would need to address to obtain membership. These issues included the need to demonstrate a history of compliance with international agreements and resolutions, a clear indication of Belize’s motivation to join the Commission, and the need to demonstrate an ability to control vessels under its flag."
WCPFC2,82,"In accordance with the recommendation in paragraph 21 of the Summary Record of the Inaugural Session of the Commission, and the procedures on Cooperating Non-members adopted at the Inaugural Session, the Cooperating Non-member status of the United States of America was extended for another year, or until it becomes a Member of the Commission, whichever occurs first."
WCPFC2,83,"The Chair noted that a request for extension of Cooperating Non-member status was not received from Indonesia. The Commission agreed that the Executive Director would write to Indonesia, and if requested by Indonesia, circulate its request for an extension of its Cooperating Non-member status out of Session.  AGENDA ITEM 12 — SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES  Guidelines for assisting developing States"
WCPFC2,84,"The Commission was informed that FFA members would prepare a strategy to guide the capacity building work of the Commission for developing States and participating territories that would be supported by the Special Requirements Fund. The finalization of the draft Guidelines prepared by the Secretariat, annexed to WCPFC/Comm2/26, would wait for the adoption of that strategy."
WCPFC2,85,"Japan reported that over the period 2006–2010, it would contribute US$ 2 million, in the form of the Japanese Trust Fund, to support capacity building in the areas of fisheries statistics, regulation and enforcement. The establishment of the Japanese Trust Fund was gratefully acknowledged by the Commission.    13AGENDA ITEM 13 — COOPERATION WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS  Cooperation, consultation and collaboration with the Commission of the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), FAO, Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), International Scientific Committee (ISC), Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC)"
WCPFC2,86,The Executive Director described progress to date in establishing relationships with other organizations as set out in WCPFC/Comm.2/19 Rev. 1.      AGENDA ITEM 14 — OTHER MATTERS  2006 UN Fish Stocks Agreement Review Conference participation
WCPFC2,87,"The Commission agreed that, given the WCPFC is the first Commission established after the entry into force of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, the Secretariat and the Chair should attend the Conference. Members were encouraged to provide information and advice to the Secretariat to assist with WCPFC preparations for the Conference.  2007 Joint Tuna RFMO Meeting"
WCPFC2,88,"The Commission noted that the FAO Committee on Fisheries agreed to a joint meeting of tuna RFMOs in Japan, 22–26 January 2007. Participation is open to all Members and Cooperating Non-members of all tuna-RFMOs and representatives of their secretariats. The Commission noted that the agenda will be broad, covering global issues such as capacity, IUU fishing, trade and opportunities to harmonize strategies to address issues of common concern to different RFMOs.  Nomenclature for Commission decisions"
WCPFC2,89,The Commission noted the need for agreement on a common interpretation of how the Commission will record its decisions as a result of the use of different and inconsistent terminology. It was noted that there was no uniform practice in other RFMOs.
WCPFC2,90,"It was clarified that any decision taken by the Commission in relation to conservation and management measures must relate to the specific provision of the Convention empowering the taking of such a measure. Generally, conservation and management measures would derive from Article 10 of the Convention, but other MCS provisions of the Convention would also be relevant."
WCPFC2,91,The Commission adopted the nomenclature as set out in WCPFC/Comm.2/29 (Attachment M).  AGENDA ITEM 15 — NEXT MEETING  Date and place of next meeting
WCPFC2,92,"The Second Regular Session of the Scientific Committee will meet 7–18 August 2006 in Manila, Philippines. The Second Regular Session of the Northern Committee is scheduled for 11–13 September 2006 in Tokyo, Japan. The tentative dates for the Second Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee are 28 September–3 October 2006 in Brisbane, Australia. The Third Regular Session of the Commission will take place 11–15 December 2006 in Apia, Samoa.    14"
WCPFC2,93,"It was agreed that i) the Regular Sessions of the Commission, after 2006, will in future be scheduled for the first full week of December, ii) alternating Sessions of the Committee will be held in Pohnpei, and iii) other Sessions will be held in Pohnpei if there were no offers to host the Session."
WCPFC3,1,"The Third Regular Session of the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC3) took place from 11–15 December 2006 in Apia, Samoa. The session was opened by the Chair of the Commission, Mr Glenn Hurry (Australia)."
WCPFC3,2,"The following Members, Cooperating Non-members (CNMs) and Participating Territories (CCMs) attended: Australia, Canada, People’s Republic of China, Cook Islands, European Union (EU), France, Fiji, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), French Polynesia, Indonesia, Japan, Kiribati, Korea, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Philippines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Chinese Taipei, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, United States of America (USA), Vanuatu, and Wallis and Futuna."

WCPFC3,6,"His Excellency Tuila’epa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minster of Samoa, delivered a welcoming address (Attachment A).  1.2 Chair’s opening statement"
WCPFC3,7,"The Chair presented an opening statement, thanking the Prime Minister for his welcoming address, and thanked Samoa's Ministries of Foreign Affairs, and Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and the National University of Samoa for the excellent meeting preparations (Attachment B).  2 1.3 Adoption of the agenda"
WCPFC3,8,The Commission adopted the agenda contained in WCPFC3-2006/02 Rev.1. AGENDA ITEM 2 — MEMBERSHIP 2.1 Status of the Convention
WCPFC3,9,"The depository for the Convention, New Zealand, presented WCPFC3-2006/07, summarizing the status of the Convention as of 10 November 2006. The Commission noted there has been no change to the status of the Convention since the last session of the Commission in December 2005 (WCPFC2). 2.2 Applications for Cooperating Non-member status"
WCPFC3,10,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC3-2006/08, advising that during 2006, the Secretariat received applications for CNM status from Indonesia, USA, Belize and Senegal. The Executive Director also reported that the Secretariat received a letter from Panama (dated 6 December 2006) seeking CNM status with the Commission."
WCPFC3,11,"The USA reported that on 7 and 9 December 2006, the US Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, approved implementing legislation, enabling it to become a full member of the Commission. The USA noted that it expects to deposit its instrument of ratification in the first quarter of 2007. This ratification will also include the full participation of American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in the work of the Commission in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention."
WCPFC3,12,The Chair thanked the USA and welcomed its imminent ratification of the Convention.
WCPFC3,13,"Indonesia reported that it was undertaking internal processes to ratify the Convention but that this was a difficult and lengthy process due to ongoing amendments to the Indonesian constitution. Consequently, Indonesia could not confirm a likely date for eventual ratification and would request that its CNM status be renewed. Indonesia also reported on its efforts to comply with the provisions of the Convention, particularly with respect to the implementation of licensing fishing vessels, logbook system, vessel monitoring system, transshipment of fish, control of input on bigeye and yellowfin tuna fisheries, and incidental catch of seabirds and sea turtles."
WCPFC3,14,The Chair thanked Indonesia and looked forward to it becoming a full member of the Commission.
WCPFC3,15,The Commission renewed the CNM status of the USA and Indonesia.
WCPFC3,16,"Belize presented its case for becoming a CNM of the Commission, noting that currently nine of its flag fishing vessels were operating in the Convention Area."
WCPFC3,17,"The Commission noted that Belize has met the legal requirements in respect to the types of data to support its application for CNM status. However, Members expressed concern regarding the technical content of these data. Despite these concerns, some Members supported the application from Belize if specific conditions were applied. Following further discussions, the Commission could not achieve consensus and therefore could not approve Belize’s application for CNM status until these concerns were addressed."
WCPFC3,18,"The Chair urged CCMs to submit their concerns regarding Belize’s application for CNM status by 28 February 2007, after which, the Secretariat would notify Belize of the 3 remaining data requirements that it would need to provide in order to have its application considered further. In his letter to Belize, the Executive Director was instructed to draw Belize’s attention to the concerns of the Commission with respect to current fishing capacity in the Convention Area and to seek clarification on the ownership and activities of Belize-flagged vessels operating in Vietnam, Singapore and Chinese Taipei."
WCPFC3,19,"The Commission agreed that Belize-flagged fishing vessels would not be deemed illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing vessels in the interim period pending WCPFC4’s consideration of its renewed application for CNM status."
WCPFC3,20,"Senegal presented its case for becoming a CNM of the Commission. The Commission agreed that because Senegal has not met the Commission’s legal requirements with respect to all data relating to the operation of its fishing vessels, which is required by the Commission to support its application for CNM status, the Commission rejected Senegal’s application for CNM status. As a result, Senegalese vessels active in the WCPFC Convention Area may be considered IUU vessels. The Commission encouraged Senegal to re-submit a more comprehensive application, addressing all of the Commission's requirements to the next regular session of the Commission. The Executive Director was directed to write to Senegal providing guidance for a re-submission of Senegal’s application for CNM."
WCPFC3,21,"Senegal considered that enough data had been provided to support its application for CNM status. In addition, Senegal noted that all of its vessels active in the Convention Area were registered with the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) Regional Register of Foreign Fishing Vessels (RREG). In response to a request for clarification from China, New Zealand — on behalf of FFA members — responded that several Senegalese vessels were on the FFA RREG and that they should be removed from that registry. The Executive Director was instructed to write to Senegal advising Senegal to remove all of its vessels from the Convention Area. Failure to comply with this request would result in the Commission further considering the status of these vessels in the WCPF Convention Area at its next Session."
WCPFC3,22,The Commission noted that the Executive Director had written to Panama advising it of the procedure for submitting an application for CNM status.    2.3 Applications for observer status
WCPFC3,23,The Commission noted an information paper prepared by the Secretariat listing current observers to the Commission (WCPFC3-2006/09).
WCPFC3,24,"The Commission accepted applications for observer status from: the Humane Society, Blue Ocean Institute, Earth Island Institute, and Centre for Environmental Law and Community Rights Inc. in PNG."
WCPFC3,25,"Japan invited the Commission to consider the observer status of the Sea Turtle Restoration Project (STRP), noting that since WCPFC2, the STRP had been responsible for a series of press releases that Japan considered to be misrepresentative of its position with relation to the interaction between sea turtles and tuna fisheries in the Convention Area. Japan stated that it welcomed the participation of observers in the work of the Commission but only if that participation was constructive and contributed positively to the Commission’s work. Japan was of the view that STRP had not honoured this understanding, and requested that the Commission consider suspending STRP's observer status since STRP had not responded to the previous communication by the Executive Director conveying Japan's concern."
WCPFC3,26,"The EU agreed on the need to remind the STRP about its privileges and obligations as an observer to the Commission. However, the EU does not support the idea that STRP, or any 4 other NGO that does not fully agree with the positions of the CCMs, be prevented from attending Commission meetings."
WCPFC3,27,"The Chair referred to Article 36 of the Rules of Procedure on the participation of observers in the meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies. The Chair emphasised that any action taken by the Commission that would affect the status of participation of STRP as an observer requires transparency in process and decision-making by consensus. Japan subsequently suggested that the Secretariat again contact the STRP, requesting the correction of its statements in earlier press releases. If STRP fails to reply or comply with this request, Japan recommended the temporary suspension of STRP's status as an observer."
WCPFC3,28,"The Commission agreed that the Executive Director would write to STRP, expressing concern on the issued press releases. If there was no response from STRP, or if the Commission found the response as unsatisfactory, an appropriate course of action with respect to the participation of STRP in the work of the Commission would be discussed at WCPFC4."
WCPFC3,29, A list of participants is presented in Attachment C. AGENDA ITEM 3 — MEMBER REPORTS 3.1 Annual reports by CCMs
WCPFC3,30,"In accordance with Articles 23 and 32 of the Convention, the Chair invited CCMs to provide reports on their progress in implementing the Convention and conservation and management measures and other decisions of the Commission. Articles 23 and 32 of the Convention also require reports to record implementation of any conservation and management measures or other decisions of the Commission. Verbal statements were made by the following CCMs:  a.   Nauru on behalf of FFA members, b.   Papua New Guinea, c.   Tuvalu, d.   Tonga, e.   European Union, and f.   Chinese Taipei."
WCPFC3,31,"Nauru, on behalf of FFA members, advised the session that while the experience and lessons of other regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) would be valuable during the early developmental stages of the WCPFC, FFA members were firmly of the view that the WCPFC has many unique characteristics that require special consideration and, in many cases, a new and innovative approach. FFA members suggested that it may be time for the Commission to begin thinking about institutional arrangements to support more focused consideration of management options and to begin taking into account economic issues associated with the management of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) tuna fishery, as is provided for in the WCPF Convention. In conclusion, Nauru presented a list of priorities for the effective operationalization of the Convention."
WCPFC3,32,"Written statements were provided by PNG, New Caledonia, Tuvalu and the USA."
WCPFC3,33,"The Chair noted that six CCMs had yet to comply with the decision of WCPFC2 regarding annual reports to the Commission. The Commission encouraged CCMs with outstanding reports to submit them to the Secretariat by 31 January 2007. The Commission 5 also urged all CCMs to fully comply with Part 1 and Part 2 reporting obligations during 2007, noting that a simplified template had been agreed on by the Commission for future use.   3.2 Statements by observers"
WCPFC3,34,"The Chair invited observers to the Commission to make statements. Written statements were presented by ACAP, CELCOR, EII, IATTC and WTPO. Greenpeace presented a statement on behalf of Birdlife International, EII, WWF, Blue Ocean Institute and the Humane Society, which supported the implementation of precautionary measures for target tuna resources and bycatch species in the WCPF Convention Area. AGENDA ITEM 4 — AD HOC TASK GROUP-DATA"
WCPFC3,35,"The Chair introduced the Chair of the Ad Hoc Task Group-Data (AHTG-Data), Mr Kim Duckworth (New Zealand) to present the report of the AHTG-Data group."
WCPFC3,36,"Mr Duckworth referred to WCPFC3-2006/11, which summarises the work of the AHTG-Data group during 31 July–4 August 2006 in Manila, Philippines. Mr Duckworth recalled the work of the Statistics Specialist Working Group (ST-SWG) at the First Regular Session of the Scientific Committee (SC1) in Noumea, New Caledonia in August 2005. He noted that SC1 had forwarded a recommendation from the ST-SWG to WCPFC2 in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia, to establish the AHTG-Data to consider data types and data confidentiality, and to develop draft rules and procedures for the security and confidentiality of WCPFC data. He noted that advice concerning the meeting had been circulated in May 2006 and that all CCMs had been encouraged to participate."
WCPFC3,37,"The AHTG-Data report to the Commission included advice and recommendations with regards to: a.   the types of information to be treated as confidential; b.   risk associated with the alteration, loss or unauthorized access to WCPFC data; c.   guiding principles required for the rules and procedures for access to and dissemination of data; d.   data security and data security standards; e.   further elaboration of an Information Security Policy for the Commission; f.   the need for a framework for access to non-public domain data by CCMs; g.   further consideration of historical data and the role of the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC); and h.   draft Rules and Procedures for Access to and Dissemination of Data Compiled by the Commission."
WCPFC3,38,"Several CCMs, including FFA members, supported the Commission’s adoption of the AHTG-Data Summary Report on the basis that it is a ""living document"" subject to refinement by the Scientific Committee (SC) and the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC), as required."
WCPFC3,39,"The IATTC requested that in future elaborations of the AHTG-Data Summary Report, the Commission consider the inclusion of a reference to cooperative data-sharing arrangements with other RFMOs. 6"
WCPFC3,40,"In relation to the AHTG-Data Summary Report, the Commission: a.   adopted the report as a ""living document"", noting Japan’s reservations based on its written comments; b.   agreed that the report be considered by SC3 and TCC3 for possible refinement; and c.   agreed that the report, as refined by SC3 and TCC3, be further considered by WCPFC4.  AGENDA ITEM 5 — SCIENCE ISSUES 5.1 Report of the Second Regular Session of the Scientific Committee"
WCPFC3,41,"Dr Dae-Yeon Moon (Chair of the Scientific Committee, Korea) presented the summary outcomes of the Second Regular Session of the Scientific Committee (SC) held in Manila, Philippines, from 7–18 August 2006. Dr John Hampton (SPC, Scientific Services Provider) presented a summary of the SC’s deliberations on stock status."
WCPFC3,42,"The SC addressed the following issues:  a.   new or updated assessments of the status of bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, South Pacific albacore, southwest Pacific swordfish, and southwest Pacific striped marlin. The 2005 assessment of skipjack tuna was not revised; b.   estimates of sustainable catch and effort levels for bigeye and yellowfin tuna; c.   investigation of methods to mitigate the impact of fishing on seabirds, sea turtles, juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna, and bycatch fish species, particularly sharks; d.   data and information requirements of the SC, including data confidentiality and access issues, coverage levels required in scientific observer programmes and specific projects, such as the Indonesia and Philippines Data Collection Project (IPDCP) and the Regional Tuna Tagging Project; and e.   cooperation with other organizations."
WCPFC3,43,"The Commission noted: a.   record high catches of skipjack and bigeye tuna in 2005. The total catch in the Convention Area was also the highest catch on record at 2.1 million metric tonnes;  b.   the assessments for yellowfin and bigeye tuna indicated that for both, overfishing is occurring (fishing mortality is greater than the reference level FMSY) but they are not yet in an overfished state (biomass is greater than the reference level BMSY); c.   the impact of the yellowfin tuna fishery has been to reduce by 50 percent the biomass of yellowfin tuna. The Indonesian/Philippine domestic fishery probably has the greatest impact, particularly in the western equatorial region. The purse-seine fishery has a lesser, but still substantial effect, particularly in the equatorial regions. The impact of the longline fishery on yellowfin tuna is relatively small; d.   the impact of the bigeye tuna fishery has been to reduce by 70 percent the biomass of bigeye tuna. Although fish aggregating device (FAD)-associated purse-seine catches have made up an increasing proportion of the fishery impact 7 on bigeye tuna biomass since the mid 1990s, and contributed to the increase in fishing mortality beyond the reference level FMSY from 1997 onwards, longline fishing continues to contribute more than half of the total impact on the stock; e.   uncertainty associated with some of the assessments, particularly southwest Pacific swordfish, South Pacific albacore, yellowfin tuna and southwest Pacific striped marlin. Some of the issues relating to data uncertainty, particularly data from Indonesia and the Philippines, have been resolved but further revisions are expected to result from the IPDCP; f.   After preliminary work presented to the SC in 2005, this was the first full stock assessment of southwest Pacific swordfish. While sensitivity analysis considered data for the entire southern region of the Convention Area, the base case assessment applied only to the southwestern part of the Convention Area (00–500S, 1400E–1750W); g.   uncertainty with the South Pacific albacore data did not greatly affect the conclusions of the assessment that South Pacific albacore was currently being fished within sustainable limits; h.   IUU fishing continues to be a problem for some CCMs. Indonesia and Cook Islands continue to seek cooperation from other CCMs to eliminate illegal fishing in their waters; i.   conservation and management measure (CMM)-related catch statistics and their analyses on key tuna species should be provided in tabular form as well as a summary figure for the Commission’s information; and j.   the Convention’s management objectives, including the application of reference points, has not yet been considered by the Commission.  5.2 Response to conservation and management measures"
WCPFC3,44,"In accordance with the requirement under CMM-2005-01, the Commission endorsed the following advice: a.   In order to keep bigeye biomass at BMSY, a reduction in fishing mortality of 25 percent from the average levels during 2001–2004 would be required. Greater levels of reduction would be required to keep bigeye biomass above BMSY.  b.   In order to keep yellowfin biomass at BMSY, a reduction in fishing mortality of 10 percent from the average levels during 2001–2004 would be required. Greater levels of reduction would be required to keep yellowfin biomass above BMSY.  c.   In response to the control of sets on FADs for the purse-seine fishery (CMM-2005-01, paragraph 15), the Commission endorsed all recommendations on research into measures to reduce the bycatch of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna (paragraphs 36–38, Executive Summary of the Scientific Committee Report)."
WCPFC3,45,"The Commission noted the SC’s advice on other target species: a.   The skipjack tuna stock is not overfished nor is overfishing occurring, and current catch levels are sustainable. b.   The South Pacific albacore stock is not overfished nor is overfishing occurring, and increases in yields should be possible. 8 c.   For swordfish in the southwestern Pacific, the assessment cannot determine with certainty whether the stock is overfished or whether overfishing is taking place, and most models predict declines in stock size at current levels of fishing mortality. There should be no increases in fishing mortality on this stock. d.   Striped marlin fishing mortality may be equal to or exceed FMSY and biomass may be at or below BMSY, and there should be no increase in fishing mortality on the stock. 5.3 Advice and recommendations of the Second Regular Session of the Scientific Committee to the Commission"
WCPFC3,46,"The Commission established an informal working group to refine proposals submitted by CCMs in respect of conservation and management measures for sharks, seabirds and sea turtles. In relation to recommendations on other fish and non-fish bycatch (paragraphs 39–41, Executive Summary), the views of CCMs varied between those proposing immediate action to reduce incidental bycatch, to those who considered that the Commission’s immediate research priorities should be on target tuna resources."
WCPFC3,47,"The Commission endorsed recommendations for: a.   further development of an Information Security Policy (paragraphs 51 and 52, Executive Summary). b.   the inclusion of the IPDCP in the core budget of the Commission, subject to budgetary implications (paragraph 53, Executive Summary). While the importance of the project was highlighted, there were views that data collection was the responsibility of each CCM, the budget for this project should be based on voluntary contributions, and that geographical coverage of this project should be clarified. c.   tagging initiatives (paragraph 54, Executive Summary). d.   cooperation with other organizations (paragraphs 55 and 56, Executive Summary). The  Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) was recommended as the first priority for the development of a memorandum of understanding. e.   the special requirements of developing states and participating territories (paragraph 57, Executive Summary). f.   the Strategic Research Plan 2007–2011 for the Scientific Committee and 2007 Work Programme (paragraphs 58 and 59, Executive Summary), noting that careful consideration should be given to the frequency of assessment of key tuna species and evaluation of management options.  g.   future operation of the SC (paragraph 62, Executive Summary)."
WCPFC3,48,"Following a presentation from China, the Commission decided to revise the recommended rules of procedure for the SC inter-sessionally, and to reconsider them at WCPFC4. Some Members expressed disappointment at this outcome given the amount of time and effort dedicated by some delegations in developing the draft presented to WCPFC3."
WCPFC3,49,"Regarding the independent review of the Commission’s science structure and functions, Japan submitted a new proposal on the review process in relation to the composition of a steering committee, nomination of reviewers, costs, etc. The Commission, noting the need for the review to be cost effective and independent, requested the SC to re-examine the terms of 9 reference for the review of the Commission’s science structure and functions, and to report on the results of the review to WCPFC4."
WCPFC3,50,FFA members requested that future advice from the SC on management measures should include an analysis of the impacts of measures on the catches of all major tuna species.
WCPFC3,51,"The Third Regular Session of the Scientific Committee (SC3) will be held from 13–24 August 2007, in Hawaii, USA. 5.4 Scientific Committee work programme for 2007"
WCPFC3,52,"The Commission endorsed the proposed work programme (Table 2 of the SC2 Summary Report) subject to budgetary considerations. In considering the provision of scientific services by SPC, the Commission noted that the management fee offered by SPC for 2007 was half of that normally charged for SPC services. The Commission expressed gratitude and appreciation to SPC for the quality of its science service."
WCPFC3,53,"The EU and Australia noted that several CCMs have, over a number of years, provided independent funds to SPC to support tuna research, tuna fisheries data collection and stock assessment, and that the Commission benefits from this indirect funding."
WCPFC3,54,"The Cook Islands, on behalf of FFA members, requested that future work of the SC assign a similar level of attention to the needs of small developing States as is given to other issues. There is a need for particular attention to be given to the multi-species nature of the WCPO tuna fishery and to begin work on an ecosystem approach to managing the fishery."
WCPFC3,55,The Commission noted the Summary Report of the Second Regular Session of the Scientific Committee.  AGENDA ITEM 6 — NORTHERN COMMITTEE 6.1 Report of the Second Regular Session of the Northern Committee
WCPFC3,56,"Mr. Benjamin Tabios (Vice Chair of the Northern Committee, Philippines) presented the summary outcomes of the Second Regular Session of the Northern Committee (NC2) held in Tokyo, Japan from 11–13 September 2006 (WCPFC/Meeting Reports/2006/3). He informed the Commission of the discussion of reports of the sixth meeting of the ISC during NC2 and the principal outcomes of SC2 as they related to the NC. The NC recommended that the Cook Islands be accorded membership to the NC and this was endorsed by the Commission.  6.2 Response to conservation and management measures"
WCPFC3,57,"Mr. Tabios presented the NC's response to requests for advice from WCPFC2, which included a review of the application of the CMM on North Pacific albacore and an examination of options for securing scientific advice for all tuna stocks of interest to the Commission.  6.3 Advice and recommendations of the Second Regular Session of the Northern Committee to the Commission"
WCPFC3,58,"Mr. Tabios presented the recommendations and advice of the NC to the Commission, which included: a.   implementation of the CMM on North Pacific albacore to be continued with no amendment; 10 b.   inclusion of a provision — if the Commission agrees to adopt a measure on southern swordfish stocks — that will prevent adverse effects on northern swordfish stocks by preventing CCMs from re-locating their fishing effort for swordfish to the area north of 20ºN latitude in the Convention Area;  c.   endorsement of memoranda of understanding that had been drafted for cooperation with the ISC and IATTC; d.   undertake measures on a voluntary basis, with respect to seabird bycatch mitigation, that take into account the best scientific evidence available for mitigating sea bird bycatch, until the Commission adopts mitigation measures for the Convention Area, including north of 20° north; e.   inclusion of striped marlin in the species to be covered by the work of the NC; and  f.   revision of scientific data to the Commission to include Pacific bluefin tuna."
WCPFC3,59,"Several FFA members expressed concerns about the role of the NC in recommending measures on North Pacific albacore applicable to areas south of 20ºN latitude. Marshall Islands, PNG, and the Federated States of Micronesia requested the NC to conduct wider consultations with coastal States if future recommended conservation and management measures of the Committee directly affect areas south of 20ºN latitude."
WCPFC3,60,"Mr Tabios emphasized that the NC did not intend to expand its jurisdiction beyond its area of competence, but that it was merely recommending a CMM that may be applied to northern albacore found in the area between 20°N and the equator. It was also noted that the CMM for northern albacore was discussed during WCPFC2 and that all CCMs had actively participated in the adoption of the CMM, which provided for its application north of the equator."
WCPFC3,61,Several CCMs also expressed concerns about the adoption of seabird catch mitigation measures applicable north of 20ºN latitude and the compatibility of those measures with CMMs that apply to the entire Convention Area.
WCPFC3,62,"New Zealand stated that the stock assessments presented to the SC were not supported by adequate details explaining the basis for the assessments, and that in future, the ISC should be encouraged to provide full details for all stock assessments to both the SC and NC."
WCPFC3,63,The Commission agreed that further studies needed to be conducted by the SC before any decision was made on the inclusion of striped marlin as a “northern stock” in accordance with the rules of procedure for the NC. The SC was requested to provide a recommendation on this matter to the Commission for its consideration at WCPFC4.
WCPFC3,64,The Chair reminded NC Members about Annex I of the rules of procedure for recommending CMMs for northern stocks.
WCPFC3,65,The Chair noted that the NC has yet to finalize its proposed rules of procedure.  6.4 Northern Committee work programme for 2007
WCPFC3,66,"In accordance with Article 12 of the Convention, Mr Tabios presented a draft work programme for the NC for 2007. This work programme was adopted by the Commission as part of the NC's report, noting the need for its further review at future sessions of the NC. The Commission noted that NC Members bear the costs of the NC's work and that such costs would be added as supplemental items to the Commission's budget. 11"
WCPFC3,67,The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) referred to the proposed use of Japan Trust Funds to support a post within the WCPFC Secretariat. FSM accepted that Japan had a right to determine how its funds would be applied but requested that the Commission be given an opportunity to comment on the terms of reference for the post before it was established.
WCPFC3,68,The NC will hold its next meeting in Japan from 11–13 September 2007.
WCPFC3,69,The Commission noted the Summary Report of the Second Regular Session of the Northern Committee.  AGENDA ITEM 7 — ADOPTION OF CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES
WCPFC3,70,"At the invitation of the Chair, FSM, on behalf of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA), gave a presentation to WCPFC3 on the Vessel Day Scheme (VDS). The VDS will come into effect on 1 December 2007 and will replace the current license allocation scheme and cap of 205 purse-seine vessels. A trial implementation will begin 1 December 2006 and will operate until 30 November 2007, after which full implementation will proceed. The VDS will control effort within the EEZs of the PNA. A total allowable effort (TAE) has been set at a level consistent with WCPFC Conservation and Management Measure 2005-01."
WCPFC3,71,"Some CCMs noted their earlier opposition to the scheme due to concerns that the PNA may allocate an annual TAE across their EEZs, which may not be consistent with fluctuating migrations of tuna through the EEZs of the PNA. Being solely for domestic implementation, the TAE would not be applicable to non-PNA members. Other CCMs accepted the right of coastal States to develop arrangements for managing fisheries within their respective zones on the basis that those arrangements are consistent with measures adopted by the Commission. Some CCMs considered that if those measures are incorporated in CMMs adopted by the Commission, then the Commission can require those measures to be periodically reviewed."
WCPFC3,72,"FFA members noted that at the time the VDS was agreed on, no other arrangements were in place throughout the Convention Area other than what was in operation within the EEZs of FFA members."
WCPFC3,73,The WCPFC3 thanked FSM for its presentation. 7.1 Conservation and management measures Review of existing measures
WCPFC3,74,The Commission reviewed the following decisions: a.   Conservation and Management Measures for Bigeye and Yellowfin Tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (CMM-2005-01) ; b.   Conservation and Management Measures for South Pacific Albacore (CMM-2005-02); c.   Conservation and Management Measures for North Pacific Albacore (CMM-2005-03); d.   Resolution on the Reduction of Overcapacity (Resolution-2005-02); e.   Resolution on the Incidental Catch of Seabirds (Resolution-2005-01); f.   Resolution to Mitigate the Impact of Fishing for Highly Migratory Fish Species on Turtles (Resolution-2005-04).  12 Conservation and Management Measures for Bigeye and Yellowfin Tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean
WCPFC3,75,"Three proposals on the conservation and management of bigeye and yellowfin tuna submitted by FFA members (WCPFC-2006/DP01), Japan (WCPFC3-2006/DP20), and Korea (WCPFC-2006/DP26) were discussed by the Commission. Drawing on these proposals and comments from CCMs, the Chair prepared a consolidated draft CMM for yellowfin and bigeye tuna for consideration by the Commission."
WCPFC3,76,"Some CCMs raised concerns about several provisions in the Chair’s draft, including the adoption of a VDS for the high seas areas in the Convention Area, a multiple use marine protected area for the high seas, implementation of temporary closures on the use of FADs in the high seas and in non-archipelagic waters, and catch reduction for longline fishing vessels. Several CCMs supported an urgent need to reduce fishing mortality of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin from fishing on FADs, and encouraged the Commission to adopt measures that are equitable and do not result in a disproportionate burden of conservation and management measures being carried by one CCM or group of CCMs. Several CCMs noted the importance of encouraging the purse-seine industry to develop fishing techniques that mitigate the catch of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna when setting on FADs."
WCPFC3,77,"Following considerable debate, the Commission adopted CMM-2006-01, Conservation and Management Measure for Bigeye and Yellowfin Tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean as a Supplement to CMM-2005-01 (Attachment D)."
WCPFC3,78,Some CCMs expressed concern that the Commission had not adopted a strong measure as recommended by the SC and that the responsibility for the lack of progress should be shared by all CCMs. PNG expressed disappointment that small island developing States appeared to be expected to carry a disproportionate burden of responsibility for conservation and management.   Conservation and Management Measures for South Pacific Albacore
WCPFC3,79,"As reported to SC2, a full stock assessment was not undertaken for South Pacific albacore in 2006, although the 2005 assessment was updated. SPC's Oceanic Fisheries Programme advised SC2 that current catch levels of South Pacific albacore appear to be sustainable and that an increase in fishing mortality and yields would be possible. However, it was emphasized that any significant increase in effort would probably reduce CPUE in Pacific Island countries’ longline fisheries to low levels with only moderate increases in yields."
WCPFC3,80,"The Commission agreed to continue the application of Conservation and Management Measure-2005-02 for South Pacific Albacore, with no amendment.  Conservation and Management Measures for North Pacific Albacore"
WCPFC3,81,"The NC recommended that the Commission continue the application of CMM-2005-03 for North Pacific albacore, with no amendment. NC Members were also requested to submit information on the implementation of this CMM, particularly with respect to the effort-control and data submission provisions, for review by the SC and TCC."
WCPFC3,82,"The Commission adopted the NC's recommendation to continue the application of CMM-2005-03 for North Pacific albacore, with no amendment.    Resolution on the Reduction of Overcapacity"
WCPFC3,83,"Tuvalu presented a draft proposal (WCPFC-2006/DP19) for an interpretative decision by the Commission in relation to the application of paragraph 2 of Resolution-2005-02. Tuvalu explained that since the adoption of Resolution-2005-02, some developed CCMs, in their 13 effort to implement the resolution and other similar measures of other RFMOs, have placed restrictions on the building and export of purse-seine vessels. These restrictions have directly inhibited the efforts of Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands in particular, and potentially other developing island State members of the Commission, to develop their domestic tuna industries. The statement by Tuvalu, introducing its proposal, is appended as Attachment E."
WCPFC3,84,"Chinese Taipei explained its domestic policy with respect to the export of fishing vessels, which seeks to prevent the expansion of fishing capacity on a regional basis. The Commission noted that it is not within its jurisdiction to instruct members on how to implement their domestic legislation relating to the implementation of the Convention."
WCPFC3,85,"The Commission acknowledged the need to ensure that the implementation of Resolution-2005-02 does not have an adverse impact on the legitimate rights and aspirations of developing island State members of the Commission. Some CCMs emphasized the need to ensure that there is also a balance between the economic development goals and aspirations of developing island State members, and the control of capacity and conservation and management of the stocks in the Convention Area. China drew attention to the provisions of paragraph 15 of CMM-2005-01 in relation to the preparation of a plan for the development of purse-seine skipjack fisheries."
WCPFC3,86,The Commission was not able to support the draft proposal submitted by Tuvalu as a CMM.
WCPFC3,87,"FFA members expressed their serious disappointment that Resolution-2005-02, which they had endorsed in good faith, had not been implemented in accordance with the language and spirit of the resolution. A statement by the Marshall Islands in relation to this matter is appended as Attachment F."
WCPFC3,88,"The Commission agreed to establish a group of eminent persons, drawn from Commission Members, to work with FFA members to examine how to practically implement Resolution-2005-02. The group would work to ensure that the legitimate aspirations of developing island State members to develop their domestic tuna fisheries are undertaken within the overall capacity limits of the tuna resources in the Convention Area."
WCPFC3,89,"The USA alerted CCMs to a recently completed survey of longline and pole-and-line vessels operating in the Convention Area, and indicated a willingness to share this report with all CCMs and the Secretariat to progress discussions related to capacity for gear types other than purse seine. Resolution on the Incidental Catch of Seabirds"
WCPFC3,90,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, presented a proposal for the adoption of a CMM to mitigate the impact of fishing for highly migratory fish stocks on seabirds (WCPFC3-2006/DP03 Rev.1). The proposal recommended voluntary and mandatory measures for longline vessels, such as side setting, night setting, the use of tori lines, weighted branch lines, blue-dyed bait, deep-setting line shooter, bait caster, and underwater setting chute."
WCPFC3,91,"Following the discussion in plenary, during which CCMs expressed strong and divergent views on bycatch mitigation measures, the Chair established an informal working group for associated species in order to further develop a draft CMM for seabird and sea turtle mitigation, and to consider a measure for sharks for subsequent consideration by the Commission. The working group was chaired by the European Commission (EC)."
WCPFC3,92,The EC subsequently tabled a draft compromise proposal (WCPFC3-2006/29 Rev.3) for consideration by the Commission.  14
WCPFC3,93,"As a result of the work undertaken in the working group, the Commission adopted the ""Conservation and Management Measure to Mitigate the Impact of Fishing for Highly Migratory Fish Stocks on Seabirds"" (Attachment G). Some CCMs expressed dissatisfaction that the Commission had not adopted a stronger measure as recommended by the SC."
WCPFC3,94,The Commission agreed on the need to review these measures and update them if required in future. Resolution to Mitigate the Impact of Fishing for Highly Migratory Fish Species on Turtles
WCPFC3,95,Resolution-2005-04 calls for action to mitigate the impact of interactions between sea turtles and fishing gear used in fishing for highly migratory fish species. The Resolution tasks the TCC with developing relevant strategies for further consideration by the Commission in 2007.
WCPFC3,96,"In 2006, the SC recommended that a flexible approach to sea turtle mitigation be adopted. CCMs recognized the need to compile existing information and to continue gathering more comprehensive data on sea turtle interactions in order to develop a more complete picture of the effectiveness of the various sea turtle bycatch mitigation strategies. This will provide the Commission with the necessary information to address interactions with sea turtles in fisheries covered by the Convention."
WCPFC3,97,"The Commission endorsed the sea turtle research programme recommended by SC2, bearing in mind the availability of resources. The Commission noted ongoing research undertaken by some CCMs on the effectiveness of circle hooks and other measures in mitigating interactions with sea turtles. CCMs were encouraged to complete research on gear and methods to avoid or reduce interactions with sea turtles, particularly circle hooks, and to provide results to the Commission to support further deliberations on this issue in 2007. CCMs were encouraged to continue research and mitigation trials, particularly in conjunction with small island developing States."
WCPFC3,98,"The Commission requested SC3 to review mitigation measures that, when applied, can substantially reduce sea turtle interactions in fisheries covered by the Convention while maintaining viable target species catch rates. WCPFC3 requested TCC3 to examine the mitigation measures compiled by SC3 and to develop technical specifications (definitions) for each measure, and to recommend these measures to the Commission. CCMs were urged to contribute to the work of the TCC3 by providing the Commission with technical specifications for sea turtle interaction mitigation methods or devices currently employed by their vessels in highly migratory species fisheries."
WCPFC3,99,"The Commission will consider the adoption of specific sea turtle interaction mitigation measures at its annual session in 2007, based on the recommendations of SC3 and the technical specifications developed by TCC3. 7.2 Consideration of new measures and other conservation requirements Conservation and Management Measure for Swordfish in the Southwest Pacific"
WCPFC3,100,"Australia introduced a proposal for a CMM for swordfish in the southwest Pacific (WCPFC3-2006/DP02 Rev.2). The proposal was based on the management advice of the SC, and promoted a precautionary approach with recommendations for no further increases in the fishing mortality of swordfish until stock status estimates become more certain. Australia emphasized that the draft CMM is applicable south of 20ºS of the Convention Area; however, Australia encouraged the NC to consider the development of a similar CMM in the Convention Area north of 20ºN for adoption by the Commission. 15"
WCPFC3,101,"The EC, referring to delegation paper WCPFC3-2006/DP34, questioned the research on which the proposal submitted by Australia was based, noting that significant questions arose as a result of selective use of the geographic areas on which the assessment was based and the biological parameters for swordfish that were used. The EC also noted that its fleet in the southwest Pacific continued to report good catch rates, which implied that the target stock was not depleted as was suggested by the Australian and New Zealand research."
WCPFC3,102," Australia responded that delegation paper WCPFC3-2006/DP34 dealt principally with a technical issue and that the issues were not raised by the EU or other CCMs during the Specialist Working Group reviews nor subsequently when the SC considered the issue. Australia remarked that the EU, in preparing its assessment, apparently did not consider the supporting documents that were reviewed by the SC (SC2-ME-WP3; SC2-ME-WP4) because many of the issues raised were covered by the documents, or were raised and resolved at the SC meeting. Australia and New Zealand tabled WCPFC3-2006/DP42 in response to the issues raised by the EC."
WCPFC3,103,"The Cook Islands expressed concern about the rapid expansion during the last two years of some CCM fleets, which are targeting swordfish. The Cook Islands noted that small island developing States are critically reliant on limited fishery resources and that the rapid expansion of CCM fleets not located in the WCPO had the potential to threaten the fishery development aspirations of small island States."
WCPFC3,104,"The Chair appointed a small informal working group to consolidate the views of CCMs on appropriate measures for swordfish. As a result of the work of the group and a joint proposal by FFA states and the EC, the Commission subsequently adopted ""Conservation and Management Measure for Swordfish in the Southwest Pacific"" (Attachment H). Conservation and Management Measure for Striped Marlin in the Southwest Pacific"
WCPFC3,105,"Australia introduced a proposal for a conservation and management measure for striped marlin in the southwest Pacific (WCPFC3-2006/DP08/Rev.1). The proposal also adopted the management advice of the SC and promoted a precautionary approach for no further increases in the fishing mortality of striped marlin until stock status estimates become more certain. Australia emphasized that the provisions of the proposed CMMs do not apply to coastal State CCMs south of 15°S of the Convention Area that have already taken, or continue to take, significant steps to address concerns over the status of striped marlin in the southwest Pacific region."
WCPFC3,106,"The Commission adopted ""Conservation and Management Measure for Striped Marlin in the Southwest Pacific"" (Attachment I)."
WCPFC3,107,"Australia requested that the Summary Record reflect its concern at the exclusion of bycatch data reporting requirements from the measure, and requested that future sessions of the Commission keep this matter under review. Conservation and Management Measures for a Vessel Chartering Scheme"
WCPFC3,108,"Niue, on behalf of FFA members, presented a proposal for a CMM for a regional vessel chartering scheme (WCPFC3-2006/DP06 Rev.1). The proposed CMM sets out the conditions for the chartering scheme, information to be submitted by chartered vessels, and the rights and obligations of flag States to exercise effective control over chartered vessels."
WCPFC3,109,"Noting the concerns expressed by some CCMs relating to the proposal, and suggestions for improvement of the proposed measure (including the need to take into account issues involving flag State and charter State responsibilities), the Commission agreed to refer the 16 draft CMM for a Regional Vessel Chartering Scheme to TCC3 for its consideration and advice."
WCPFC3,110,"Japan reiterated its views regarding charter arrangements as long-term arrangements, and stated that it will resubmit its proposal (WCPFC3-2006/DP32) on vessel charter arrangement for consideration at TCC3, taking into account the comments of other members including the proposal tabled by FFA members (WCPFC-2006/DP06 Rev.1).  Conservation and Management of Sharks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean"
WCPFC3,111,"Palau, on behalf of FFA members, presented a proposal for the adoption of a CMM for sharks caught in association with fisheries in the Convention Area (WCPFC3-2006/DP04). This document was subsequently revised to incorporate Japan’s comments (WCPFC3-2006/DP28)."
WCPFC3,112,"The proposal aims to implement the FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, particularly by encouraging CCMs to adopt National Plans of Action and apply measures for the full utilization of sharks. Such measures pertain to the collection of data on sharks, retention, landing, transshipment and trade in shark fins, and the release of live sharks incidentally caught by tuna and tuna-like fisheries."
WCPFC3,113,"In response to a question from the EU, SPC's Oceanic Fisheries Programme advised that current data holdings for shark fisheries in the WCPO are not comprehensive and that the available information is hard to consolidate. The EU, supported by Australia, proposed that all shark catch data, including shark bycatch data, be provided to the Commission as a mandatory requirement and that the Commission should identify current gaps in the provision of these data by CCMs."
WCPFC3,114,"Australia informed the Commission of initiatives to establish conservation and management arrangements for sharks, such as those being promoted by the Convention on Migratory Species, and that these initiatives were appearing because of a perception that some RFMOs are not doing enough to responsibly manage shark resources. Such initiatives served as a motivator for the Commission to establish internationally acceptable arrangements for shark conservation and management in the WCPO."
WCPFC3,115,"Following a discussion in plenary, during which CCMs expressed strong and divergent views on conservation and management arrangements for sharks, and further deliberation in the informal working group convened by the Chair for considering associated species, the Commission adopted ""Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean"" (Attachment J), noting that the measure should be periodically reviewed by the Commission and refined as necessary."
WCPFC3,116,"In a general statement, the USA understood that the Preparatory Conference had agreed that, because of the difficulty delimitating the western boundary of the Convention Area the Commission would describe the area of application of each CMMs, and the data required to support it, for each CCM as it is adopted. This was confirmed by the Chair."
WCPFC3,117," FFA members expressed the view that the TCC should, as a matter of priority, begin to determine benchmarks and mechanisms to monitor and assess the implementation of CMMs adopted by the Commission. The fulfillment of the function of the TCC as set out in Article 14(1) (a) should commence in 2007 and should be an ongoing priority task for the TCC. 7.3 Allocation"
WCPFC3,118,"Dr David Agnew (Marine Resources Assessment Group Ltd., United Kingdom) presented a review of tuna resource allocation matters for the Commission's consideration in 17 developing a scheme for the allocation of WCPO tuna resources (WCPFC3-2006/15). The report was commissioned by WCPFC2, and reviews specific challenges that the Commission will encounter by addressing the issue of allocation, and describes options for allocation schemes that may be utilized to address these challenges."
WCPFC3,119,"FSM, on behalf of FFA members, stated that the report provides a basis for further discussion on allocation, and reflects an appropriate balance of the interests of CCMs. However, FFA members expressed concern about the report’s treatment of central issues of allocation. FFA members indicated that the role of the Commission is to determine stock-wide effort and catch limits and to make allocations for the high seas with no major role in waters under national jurisdiction as that is subject to the sovereign rights of coastal states. FFA members believe that CCMs will need to think beyond the limited scope of the report, and suggested that the report be referred to the SC and TCC for discussion and review, with reports made to WCPFC4."
WCPFC3,120,"The Commission noted New Zealand’s plans to submit a proposal to WCPFC4 for holding a workshop on allocation, to be held in New Zealand in 2008."
WCPFC3,121,"Some CCMs, while noting the report’s utility regarding the allocation issue, stated that they were not in a position to negotiate the basic legal framework of management of highly migratory species in relation to allocation. They suggested that the Commission prioritize its work so that issues such as conservation and management and fishing capacity are addressed prior to the issue of allocation."
WCPFC3,122,"The Commission: a.   agreed that written comments by CCMs on the allocation report should be provided  to the Executive Director by 31 August 2007 for collation and presentation to WCPFC4;  b.   noted the possibility of an allocation workshop to be held in New Zealand in 2008; and c.   agreed on the need to prioritize the issues before the Commission, including the allocation issue, to assist with strategic planning.  7.4 Proposal for a system of temporary purse-seine closures"
WCPFC3,123,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC3-2006/16. This paper, prepared with the assistance of the Commission’s Scientific Services Provider, was designed to support discussion on temporary purse-seine closures in the Convention Area, as called for in paragraph 11 of CMM 2005-01. The paper examines options for reducing fishing mortality on bigeye and yellowfin tuna in the WCPO, including spatial and temporal closures of the most significant purse-seine fishing grounds in the Convention Area to purse-seine fishing, prohibitions of fishing on associated sets in the third or fourth quarters of the year, and a quota on bigeye longline catch on the high seas. While many of the scenarios meet the FMSY management objective for yellowfin tuna, the only scenario that met the same objective for bigeye tuna required either some reduction in longline catches to supplement the purse-seine measures, or a 75 percent reduction in purse-seine catches. Many Members welcomed this analysis and thanked the Secretariat for the comprehensive paper."
WCPFC3,124,"FFA members advised that they could not accept the use of closures as the primary instrument for long-term tuna management, as they sustain overcapacity, contribute to economic inefficiency, undermine coastal States' rights, and disproportionately disadvantage small island States. However, FFA members considered that there may be a role for closures aimed at reducing bycatch, or as an interim measure while other measures are developed. 18 Although paragraph 11 of CMM 2005-01 calls for any closure measure considered by the Commission to be consistent with the system in operation in the eastern Pacific Ocean, FFA members did not regard the use of closures in the IATTC as an appropriate model for use in the WCPFC."
WCPFC3,125,The Philippines stated that measures that restrict coastal States (e.g. closures) should be avoided.
WCPFC3,126,Several CCMs supported the closure of high seas enclaves to all purse-seine fishing because creating such a closure would assist in deterring IUU activities of fishers who often use such areas as refuges from enforcement activities. The closure of the high seas from purse-seine fishing might eventually lead to the creation of high seas protected areas.
WCPFC3,127,"Indonesia expressed reservations to committing to closures as the analysis was based on data from the Sulawesi Sea and archipelagic waters, which Indonesia stated are not within the Convention Area. The Commission recalled discussions during the Preparatory Conference regarding the western boundary for the Convention Area. It noted that the region was subject to numerous claims and counter-claims over maritime areas and that this made it extremely difficult to define the western limit for the Convention Area. The Commission noted the importance of the western region as an area supporting substantial fisheries that target tuna resources shared with CCMs. Some CCMs proposed that it was time to take action that will enable the Commission to agree on a western boundary."
WCPFC3,128,"Several CCMs recommended that the analysis and impacts of the options for temporary purse-seine closures be reviewed by the SC. At the same time, the SC should review reference points and the appropriateness of MSY-based management in a multi-species context, for application to WCPO tuna fisheries."
WCPFC3,129," FFA members noted that the reason that they did not support a FAD closure this year was because of concern over the possible severe impacts that a FAD closure could have on some FFA members, and the lack of information to assess those impacts."
WCPFC3,130,New Zealand emphasized that research on the reduction of bycatch from FADs should continue and that closures should not relate to un-associated purse-seine sets or to areas where there is no significant bycatch of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna.
WCPFC3,131,"Japan raised several questions concerning the geographic areas of principal concern with respect to the greatest fishery impact on the bigeye stock, the impact of a limited data set from the Indonesian region, uncertainty associated with the impact of the purse-seine fishery on the bigeye stock (particularly since 1995), and the basis for the assessed significant impact of the longline fishery on the bigeye stock."
WCPFC3,132,"SPC's Oceanic Fisheries Programme advised that the greatest fishery impact on the bigeye stock occurs in the equatorial zone in the western region. Although data from the western region for the Indonesian and Philippine fisheries are poor, the situation is improving and this is at least partly due to the efforts of the Indonesian Philippine Data Collection Project (IPDCP). However, historical data from fisheries in this area are generally poor. Separation of yellowfin and bigeye in the catch data since 2004 has resulted in significant changes in the catch estimates for bigeye and yellowfin from Indonesia; however, as this information was received after the 2005 assessments had been completed, they were yet to be incorporated in the assessments. Considerably more work is required to improve fishery data for Indonesia, particularly prior to 2004. Other issues contributing to uncertainties include the fact that bigeye has not consistently been reported as a separate species from yellowfin, particularly in purse-seine logsheet data. This was an important matter that needed to be addressed through activities such as port sampling and observer programmes.  19"
WCPFC3,133,"Japan stated that the inclusion of options considering longline restrictions, and a review of the effectiveness of CMM-2005-01, were outside of the mandate of the review. Japan requested that the paper be recalled due to its concerns that the paper was unintentionally biased. Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei rejected the option for reducing longline catch, with Chinese Taipei noting that it had already reduced its WCPO bigeye longline fleet by 35 vessels during the last two years."
WCPFC3,134,"Chinese Taipei, supported by several CCMs, stated that measures should strive for compatibility between high seas and waters under national jurisdiction in accordance with Article 8 of the Convention."
WCPFC3,135,"The USA observed that the analysis had shown that a closure of high seas waters was not sufficient for achieving the reduction in mortality recommended by the SC and that larger area closures, or closures targeting hotspots, should also be considered as a management option. The USA identified four elements to be incorporated in any closure measure:   a. reference to the 1999 Resolution on overcapacity,   b. the area of application should include the entire Convention Area,   c. a limitation on FADs, and   d. some measure to reduce longline effort and catch."
WCPFC3,136,The Commission noted the paper and its utility in informing the discussions on Agenda Item 7.1(1). AGENDA ITEM 8 — TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE ISSUES 8.1 Report of the Second Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee
WCPFC3,137,"Mr Apolosi Turaganivalu (Chair of the Technical and Compliance Committee, Fiji) presented the summary outcomes of the Second Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC2) held in Brisbane, Australia from 28 September–3 October 2006. He reported that TCC2 agreed that its three main issues at present are the Commission’s vessel monitoring system (VMS), Regional Observer Programme, and procedures for high seas boarding and inspection in the Convention Area. TCC2 also identified several elements as requiring considerable work: bycatch mitigation, review of Commission decisions relating to the functions of the TCC, mechanisms to monitor compliance and the development of sanctions in the event of non-compliance, transshipment, IUU vessel lists, port State measures, and a catch and/or statistical documentation scheme."
WCPFC3,138,"FFA members noted the need for an integrated and comprehensive framework for monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement to assist the Commission in ensuring the effective conservation and long-term sustainable use of highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area, in accordance with the WCPF Convention. Such a framework is also needed to address problems associated with illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Convention Area, both within and beyond areas under national jurisdiction."
WCPFC3,139,"Other CCMs noted the need for: a.  a WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels that records information on which vessels are ""active"" in the Convention Area,  b.  non-CCMs to be encouraged to apply for Cooperating Non-member status,  c.  a mechanism to identify IUU vessels, and 20 d.  speedy implementation of the Regional Observer Programme."
WCPFC3,140,"In relation to the format of Part 2 of the Annual Report, the Commission endorsed TCC2’s recommendations that: a. the revised template for Part 2 of the Annual Report (Attachment K) be adopted for future reports; b. Part 2 of the Annual Report be completed on a calendar year basis and submitted to the Secretariat by 31 July each year; c. the Commission invite the SC to review Part 1 of the Annual Report in light of its relationship with Part 2, including its consistencies (such as reporting periods and submission times); and d.  the Secretariat be tasked with preparing guidelines, including minimum standards, for the completion of Part 2 of the Annual Report. These guidelines should be focused to ensure that a minimum level of consistency is achieved without being overly prescriptive."
WCPFC3,141,"In relation to a process for monitoring, reviewing and reporting on compliance with the Convention and the decisions of the Commission, including a proposed process for determining appropriate action in the event of non-compliance, the Commission endorsed TCC2’s recommendation that the revised Figure 1 (process and structure for monitoring compliance by CCMs and the application by non-CCM fishing vessels of conservation and management measures, Attachment L) be adopted as the Commission’s procedures for monitoring and assessing compliance by CCM fishing vessels with the Commission’s CMMs. Tonga, on behalf of FFA members, noted that future work for the TCC will be to develop rules and procedures for developing sanctions and mechanisms for applying such sanctions.  8.2 Response to Conservation and Management Measures"
WCPFC3,142,"Mr Turaganivalu presented TCC2’s response to requests for advice from the Commission on technical matters associated with the implementation of existing CMMs, namely authorization to fish, Commission VMS, Regional Observer Programme, High Seas Boarding and Inspection Procedures, port State measures, transshipment monitoring, charter arrangements scheme, options for catch and trade documentation with a focus on bigeye tuna, and IUU vessel lists."
WCPFC3,143,"While the issue of authorization to fish focused on the application of CMM-2004-01 whereby carrier and bunker vessels flagged to non-CCMs cannot be licensed by CCMs, the Commission agreed with the TCC2 recommendation that strict regulations be placed on identified carriers and bunkers flagged to non-CCMs operating in the Convention Area during a one-year phase-out period."
WCPFC3,144,"The Commission agreed that the following regulations shall be applied to such carriers and bunkers during that one-year period: a. only bunkers and carriers identified to the Commission by CCMs can operate in the Convention Area; b. the Secretariat shall maintain a temporary register of carriers and bunkers identified by the Commission to whom the exemption from paragraph A(1)(c) of the CMM-2004-01 shall apply; c. these identified carriers and bunkers shall comply with all other CMMs adopted by the Commission; 21 d.  additional carriers and bunkers may be added to this temporary register during the one-year period. Any further vessels that are added shall also be subject to the above regulations; e.  vessels identified as engaged in IUU activities by other RFMOs cannot be entered on the temporary register; and f.  taking into account concerns that some developed CCMs may be using open registries to circumvent conservation and management measures and thereby expand capacity, the TCC shall further consider issues surrounding beneficial ownership and control of carriers and bunkers listed on the temporary register."
WCPFC3,145,"On the issue of the Commission VMS, the Commission endorsed TCC2’s advice and recommendations that the Commission should: a.  develop a stand-alone VMS with the added capability of accepting VMS data forwarded from the FFA VMS. Vessels operating on the high seas in the Convention Area, and which are required to report VMS data to the Commission, will have the option to report those data via the FFA VMS; and b.  adopt draft minimum automatic location communicator (ALC) standards."
WCPFC3,146,"The Commission considered a draft CMM on the Commission VMS (WCPFC3-2006/28) prepared by the Secretariat, which includes draft minimum ALC standards as an annex."
WCPFC3,147,"Canada, as Chair of the small group of CCMs that met on this issue, tabled a revised draft CMM on the Commission VMS (WCPFC3-2006/30 Rev.2) to cater for the strong and divergent views on the timing of implementation and the area of coverage."
WCPFC3,148,The Commission adopted this Conservation and Management Measure for the Commission VMS (Attachment M).
WCPFC3,149,"On the issue of the Regional Observer Programme (ROP), the Commission endorsed TCC2’s recommendations that: a. an inter-sessional working group (IWG-ROP) be established to expedite further development of the ROP, in conjunction with the employment of an Observer Programme Coordinator (OPC) by the Secretariat; and b.  the Commission task TCC3 with developing a Conservation and Management Measure for the establishment of the ROP."
WCPFC3,150,"A proposal developed by FFA members in consultation with other CCMs — entitled ""Conservation and Management Measure for the Regional Observer Programme"" (WCPFC3-2006/DP5, Rev.1) — to advance action on the issue of the ROP was tabled for adoption. The Commission adopted this proposal (Attachment N), noting that the proposed IWG-ROP should be convened as early as practical in 2007."
WCPFC3,151,"On the issue of high seas boarding and inspection, the Philippines noted that the draft prescribes the use of force in cases of failure to allow boarding of inspectors. The Philippines maintained that the remedial action for obstructing inspectors to execute their duties should not be the use of force but that which is similar to the refusal to allow boarding of inspectors as provided for in paragraphs 25 and 26 of the procedure. The Philippines also sought clarification on the use of the term ""serious violations"", which might imply that there exist less serious violations. The Philippines noted the need for clarification on what violations under paragraph 36 of the procedures would graduate into ""serious violations"". 22"
WCPFC3,152,"The EU stated that both it and its member states shall refrain from the threat or use of force, in accordance with the general principles of international law, the United Nations Charter and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. In addition, the EU and its member States underline that the use of force, as referred to in article 27 and 28, constitutes an exceptional measure that must be based upon strict compliance with the principle of proportionality, and that any abuse thereof shall imply the international liability of the inspecting State. Any case of non-compliance shall be resolved by peaceful means and in accordance with the applicable dispute settlement procedures."
WCPFC3,153,"Korea stated that boarding and inspection on the high seas should primarily be targeted at ensuring and promoting compliance with CMMs in force and with the applicable rules of international law. It also believes that boarding and inspection should not interfere unduly with normal and lawful fishing activities, nor prejudice the safety of the fishing vessel and its crew. As such, Korea emphasized that boarding and inspection should be carried out in a safe and efficient manner where there are clear or reasonable grounds to suspect that the target vessel is engaged in IUU fishing activities."
WCPFC3,154,"China noted the need for more detailed information on the implementation of the procedures, (e.g. advice to fishermen of their obligations, and of the obligations of flag States and inspecting States under these procedures)."
WCPFC3,155,"The Commission requested that the Executive Director begin developing the information necessary for the implementation of the Boarding and Inspection Procedures as provided for in paragraphs 11 through 18 and paragraph 20 of the Procedures, and agreed that boarding and inspection operations pursuant to the procedures would be authorized to begin 60 days after the circulation to CCMs by the Executive Director of the register of authorized inspection vessels in accordance with paragraph 17. In particular, WCPFC3 requested the Executive Director, in consultation with CCMs, to make arrangements for the design of the WCPFC Inspection Flag (paragraph 18), the approved identity card (paragraph 19), and the preparation of the multi-language questionnaire (paragraph 21)."
WCPFC3,156,"The Commission adopted the ""Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission High Seas Boarding and Inspection Procedures"" (Attachment O)."
WCPFC3,157,"In relation to port State measures, the Commission endorsed TCC2’s request that all CCMs provide outstanding information on existing port State and/or port inspection schemes to the Secretariat by 1 February 2007 to allow the Secretariat to undertake a gaps analysis for existing measures relative to the FAO Guidelines and to develop draft harmonized port State standards to be discussed at TCC3."
WCPFC3,158," New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, stressed that the harmonized port State standards to be developed must not undermine a port State’s sovereignty, and that they should only seek to set out minimum standards to be adopted in port. Such standards would not preclude a CCM from adopting more stringent national measures. In essence, the Commission’s scheme would become a code for WCPFC port States, ensuring that harmonized and consistent standards are being utilized within the WCPFC. Strengthened port State measures will seriously hinder those who seek to engage in IUU fishing in the WCPF Convention Area, both in areas under national jurisdiction and on the high seas."
WCPFC3,159,"On the issue of transshipment, the Commission: a.  agreed that interested CCMs collaborate with the Secretariat to prepare a draft proposal on transshipment for consideration at TCC3; and 23 b.  endorsed TCC2’s recommendation to extend, for a further 12 months, a 12-month exemption to the Philippines and FFA members regarding existing at-sea transshipment activities until transshipment guidelines are adopted at WCPFC4."
WCPFC3,160," Palau, on behalf of FFA members, stated that, in accordance with Article 29(3) of the Convention, the focus of future efforts with respect to the development of transshipment procedures should be verification; that is, obtaining and verifying data on the quantity and species transshipped, both in port and at sea, and verifying when transshipment has been completed."
WCPFC3,161," In relation to IUU vessel lists, a proposal developed by the EU, with the assistance of other CCMs, was tabled for adoption. It is entitled ""Proposal for a Conservation and Management Measure to establish a list of vessels presumed to have carried out illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities in the western and central Pacific Ocean"" (WCPFC3-2006/DP14 Rev.2)."
WCPFC3,162,"The US stated its desire to ensure that the flag state of a vessel charged with violations be able to provide input to the process prior to any decision to place the vessel on an IUU list. It further stated that these provisions should amended as needed, a view shared by other CCMs."
WCPFC3,163,"Following clarification to a query from FFA members to ensure any measure adopted by the Commission is consistent with the International Plan of Action (IPoA) to Combat IUU Fishing, the Commission adopted the ""Conservation and Management Measure to Establish a List of Vessels Presumed to have Carried Out Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean"" (Attachment P)."
WCPFC3,164," FFA States presented a proposal to the Commission to adopt a Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) (WCPFC3-2006/DP07 Rev.1). The EC subsequently further elaborated this proposal (WCPFC3-2006/DP33) and Japan presented a proposal for the Commission to consider the adoption of a Statistical Document Program (SDP) (WCPFC3-2006/DP17). On the issue of options for a documentation scheme covering all catch, as called for at WCPFC2, the Chair noted that although there was no consensus among CCMs for a CDS, there was a general feeling that times have moved on and that statistical information schemes had proven to be insufficient in covering all areas of concern. Japan, supported by some CCMs, did not support this view stating that the WCPFC is the only RFMO without an SDP for bigeye tuna and that an SDP was critical for the effective implementation of other compliance measures such as the IUU List. Japan also stated that it believed that a SDP would be less onerous than a complicated CDS that could prove difficult to implement for many CCMs. Other CCMs were of the opinion that a catch document scheme was necessary to ensure the recording of all fish caught and traded."
WCPFC3,165, The Commission agreed that interested CCMs would continue their dialogue on this matter inter-sessionally and that the matter would be taken up again at the next meeting of the TCC for subsequent consideration by WCPFC4. 8.3 Advice and recommendations from the Second Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee to the Commission
WCPFC3,166,"Mr Turaganivalu presented advice and recommendations from TCC2 on issues associated with:  a. catch mitigation measures for juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna taken around FADs (CMM-2005-01, para. 2, 11, 13 and 15); 24 b. mitigation measures for the incidental catch of seabirds (Resolution-2005-01, para.4); and c. the use of circle hook gear technology in longline fisheries as part of turtle bycatch mitigation measures (Resolution-2005-01, para.6 and 12)."
WCPFC3,167,The Commission took into account the advice and recommendations of TCC2 in the formulation of the decisions of WCPFC3 on these issues.  8.4 Technical and Compliance Committee work programme for 2007
WCPFC3,168,"In accordance with Article 14 of the Convention, Mr Turaganivalu presented a draft work programme and budget for 2007 (including an indicative budget for 2008) for the TCC for consideration in the formulation of the Commission’s 2007 work programme and budget."
WCPFC3,169," Niue, on behalf of FFA members, proposed that the TCC should be requested to prepare a more detailed five-year work plan, setting out a timeline for completion of key tasks in the Committee’s work programme. Such a work plan should accompany future budgets."
WCPFC3,170,"The Commission noted that the Third Regular Session of the TCC will convene from 27 September–2 October 2007 in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia."
WCPFC3,171,The Commission noted the report of the Second Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee.
WCPFC3,172,"On behalf of the Commission, the Chair thanked Mr Turaganivalu for his excellent work as TCC Chair for the past two years.  AGENDA ITEM 9 — ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION"
WCPFC3,173,"In accordance with Rule of Procedure 13, the Executive Director provided his Annual Report on the work of the Commission for 2006 in WCPFC3-2006/10. During 2006 the work of the Commission included monitoring progress with implementation of Conservation and Management Measures and Resolutions adopted at WCPFC2, implementing the programme of work approved at WCPFC2, convening the Second Regular Sessions of the Commission’s subsidiary bodies, engagement and consultation with other organisations, and establishing logistic and administrative support functions at the office of the Secretariat in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia."
WCPFC3,174,The Commission noted the Executive Director’s Annual Report on the work of the Commission in 2006. AGENDA ITEM 10 — ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES
WCPFC3,175," Following an overview of papers WCPFC3-2006/17–22 and WCPFC3-2006/26 by the Secretariat, the Commission deferred plenary discussion of this agenda item pending consideration of agenda items 5.4; 8.4; 10.1; 10.2; 10.3; 10.4; and 13 by an Ad-Hoc Working Group on Finance and Administration. Mr Tapusalaia Terry Toomata of Samoa and Mr Jae Sung Lee of Korea were appointed joint chairs of this working group."
WCPFC3,176,The Ad-hoc Working Group’s summary report and recommendations were presented to the Commission by the co-chairs (Attachment Q).
WCPFC3,177," In considering the Ad-hoc Working Group’s report, concern was expressed by some CCMs about the use of part of the Working Capital Fund to finance a proportion of the core budget. Canada, supported by several CCMs, requested that in future cases where a CCM has 25 a concern about a proposed budget, and in order to facilitate the work of the Finance and Administration Committee, 30 days notice should be given to the Secretariat regarding this concern."
WCPFC3,178, French Polynesia indicated that it may be able to make a voluntary contribution to the 2007 budget.
WCPFC3,179, The EU stated that the budget means nothing if CCMs do not pay their contributions and urged CCMs to fulfill this obligation.
WCPFC3,180," France requested that in the future, consideration be given to adjusting its assessed contributions to take into account its membership in two RFMOs with overlapping areas of application."
WCPFC3,181,"The Commission adopted the recommendations contained in the summary report of the Ad-hoc Working Group to the Commission and a budget of USD 3,006,258 was agreed on for 2007. Among those recommendations was that the Commission establish a standing Finance and Administration Committee to meet at the annual session to provide advice and recommendations to the Commission on matters related to the budget, finance and administration of the Commission. The 2007 budget, 2008 indicative budget, financing table and the 2007 contributions table are respectively set out in Annexes I, II and III of Attachment Q."
WCPFC3,182,"  While it did not have an opportunity to consider it in detail, the Commission noted the Chair’s Draft Programme of Work/Conservation Measures and Strategies (WCPFC3-2006/IP09) as a reference for future discussion regarding a strategy for prioritizing the work of the Commission for the period 2007–2011 (Attachment R). A medium to long-term strategic plan for the progressive development and implementation of the Commission’s work required further elaboration with input from the Commission’s three subsidiary bodies. The Secretariat was tasked with progressing this during 2007 together with the further development of a business plan to guide the role of Secretariat.     10.1 Venue and dates for next meeting"
WCPFC3,183,"The Third Regular Session of the Scientific Committee will meet from 13–24 August 2007 at Honolulu, Hawaii. The Third Regular Session of the Northern Committee will meet from 11 to 13 September at Tokyo, Japan. The Third Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee will meet from 27 September–3 October 2007 in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia. The Fourth Regular Session of the Commission will take place from 3–7 December 2007 in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia.  AGENDA ITEM 11 — SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES"
WCPFC3,184,"Following clarification several queries from Japan concerning the application of the Special Requirements Fund to the private sector, WCPFC3 adopted guidelines for capacity building among developing States using the Special Requirements Fund that had been prepared by the Secretariat for consideration at WCPFC2 and subsequently refined by FFA members during 2006 (WCPFC3-2006/DP22 Rev.1). AGENDA ITEM 12 — COOPERATION WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS"
WCPFC3,185,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC-2006/25, which describes progress during 2006 in establishing and maintaining relationships with other RFMOs and regional organizations, particularly those with related objectives and which can contribute to the 26 attainment of the Convention’s objectives. As part this presentation, the Executive Director announced that the MOU between the WCPFC and IATTC was signed on 15 December 2006, that the arrangement with SPC's Oceanic Fisheries Programme was being implemented effectively, and that additional work would be required in 2007 to initiate new formal arrangements with the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme and the Agreement for the Conservation of Albatross and Petrels."
WCPFC3,186,France noted the importance of formalizing the arrangement with IATTC as French Polynesia is a member of both the WCPFC and IATTC and its territorial waters are in the Convention Area of both organizations.
WCPFC3,187,The Commission noted the Executive Director’s report on cooperation with other organizations and endorsed the signing of the MoU with the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC).  AGENDA ITEM 13 — WORK PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2007 AND INDICATIVE WORK PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2008
WCPFC3,188,This item was dealt with concurrently with Agenda Item 10. AGENDA ITEM 14 — ELECTION OF OFFICERS
WCPFC3,189,"The Executive Director chaired a session to consider nominations for the positions of WCPFC Chair, WCPFC Vice Chair, TCC Chair, TCC Vice Chair and SC Vice Chair."
WCPFC3,190,The Commission elected the following as WCPFC officers: a.   WCPFC Chair – Mr Glenn Hurry (Australia) b.  WCPFC Vice Chair – Mr Liu Xiaobing (China) c.   TCC Chair – Mr Feleti Teo (Tuvalu) d.   TCC Vice Chair – Mr Wendell Sanford (Canada)
WCPFC3,191," Because no suitable candidate for the position of SC Vice Chair was available, New Zealand stated that Dr Shelton Harley could continue to serve in this role on the understanding that a suitable candidate would be available in the coming months. This offer was gratefully received by the Commission.   AGENDA ITEM 15 — OTHER MATTERS 15.1 Joint meeting of tuna RFMOs"
WCPFC3,192,"Japan provided details of a meeting of tuna RFMOs scheduled to take place in Kobe, Japan from 22–26 January 2007."
WCPFC3,193,"Vanuatu, on behalf of FFA members, thanked Japan for making available funding to support the participation at this meeting of Pacific Island States. FFA members proposed the following areas for discussion at the meeting: a. harmonization of vessel records between RFMOs; b. coordination of VMS between RFMOs; 27 c. harmonization of vessel markings between tuna RFMOs; d. catch documentation schemes and other information schemes; e. consideration of the work of the High Seas Task Force on IUU Fishing; and f. improved controls at a global level of bunker and carrier vessels as a deterrent to IUU fishing. 15.2 Informal Convention Area map"
WCPFC3,194,"Korea expressed concerns regarding a map depicting the Convention Area, which was distributed during WCPFC3. Korea noted that the map does not accurately illustrate maritime boundaries in the Convention Area. Korea requested that this map not be further distributed. Korea also stated that since maps or any other illustrations reflecting the WCPFC Area of Application may be critical in the future stages of the Commission’s work, the Commission, its subsidiary bodies, and the Secretariat should exercise caution in producing and distributing maps or other illustrations. Chinese Taipei expressed the same concern suggesting that a footnote indicating that the maritime boundaries of the EEZs of individual members may not represent their actual delimitation be included in future maps to clear any misunderstanding."
WCPFC3,195,"The Executive Director advised that the map, and as identified in the footnote, was intended to display approximate boundaries only. He advised that CCMs will be consulted prior to the preparation of similar material in future.  15.3 Venue for WCPFC5"
WCPFC3,196,The Commission gratefully accepted Korea’s offer to host the 2008 WCPFC Regular Session of the Commission.  AGENDA ITEM 16 — CLOSE OF MEETING
WCPFC3,197,"The meeting closed at 9.00 pm on Friday, 15 December 2006."
WCPFC4,1," The Fourth Regular Session of the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC4) took place from 2–7 December 2007 at Tumon, Guam, USA. The following Members attended: Australia, Canada, People’s Republic of China, Cook Islands, European Community (EC), Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Fiji, France, Japan, Kiribati, Korea, Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Philippines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Chinese Taipei, Tonga, Tuvalu, United States of America (USA) and Vanuatu."

WCPFC4,5,"Observers from the following non-governmental organizations attended WCPFC4:  American Fisheries Research Foundation (AFRF), BirdLife International, Earth Island Institute, Greenpeace, the Marine Stewardship Council, Pacific Island Tuna Industry Association, World Tuna Purse Seine Organization (WTPO), and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).  2"
WCPFC4,6,A List of Participants is appended (Attachment A). 1.1 Opening ceremony and welcoming address
WCPFC4,7," A Chamorroan chant was performed to open the meeting. The Honorable Felix P. Camacho, Governor of Guam, delivered a welcoming address. 1.2 Opening statements"
WCPFC4,8," The Chair presented an opening statement that highlighted the positive developments in the Commission’s work over the past year, identified the key challenges for this meeting, and reviewed current challenges facing world tuna fisheries and the implications for the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) (Attachment B)."
WCPFC4,9," In its first statement as a new Member of the Commission, the USA expressed its pleasure at becoming a full Member with the same responsibilities and rights under the Convention as other Members, and the same level of commitment towards it success. The USA also expressed its appreciation for the consideration it had been given by other Members while it completed its ratification processes and pledged to work cooperatively with all Members, Cooperating Non-members and Participating Territories (CCMs) on the critical issues of stock sustainability, bycatch, and monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS). The USA’s statement is appended (Attachment C)."
WCPFC4,10,"New Zealand, as Chair of FFA, presented an opening statement on behalf of FFA members, thanking the WCPFC Secretariat for its work during the year and urging all CCMs to work together in a constructive manner to implement effective MCS measures and resolve issues related to bigeye and yellowfin tuna conservation and management measures (CMMs). The statement noted the challenges of addressing allocation concerns while acknowledging the sovereign rights of small island developing States (SIDS) to develop their fisheries in a responsible manner. Concern was also expressed regarding the activities of distant-water fishing nations that are not WCPFC Members and whose vessels may be undermining the Commission’s efforts to sustainably manage fisheries (Attachment D)."
WCPFC4,11,Other CCMs submitted opening statements in written form (see Attachment E – Philippines; Attachment F – PNG; Attachment G – Korea; and Attachment H – New Caledonia).   1.3 Adoption of agenda
WCPFC4,12,The Commission adopted the agenda contained in WCPFC4-2007/02 Rev.1 and the provisional schedule of work contained in WCPFC4-2007/04 Rev.1.   1.4   Meeting arrangements
WCPFC4,13,"The WCPFC Executive Director, Andrew Wright, introduced WCPFC Secretariat technical staff attending the meeting, including Andrew Richards, Compliance Manager; Ken Smithson, Finance and Administrative Officer; SungKwon Soh, Science Manager; Karl Staisch, Observer Programme Coordinator; Ziro Suzuki, Japan Trust Fund Coordinator; Herolyn Movik, Office Manager; and Lucille Martinez, Executive Assistant. In addition to WCPFC Secretariat staff, four meeting participants provided support services: Dr Shelley  3 Clarke, rapporteur; Iain Hayes, VMS (vessel monitoring system) consultant; Dr Martin Tsamenyi, legal advisor; and Dr John Hampton from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community’s Oceanic Fisheries Programme (SPC-OFP), representing the Commission’s Scientific Services Provider.    AGENDA  ITEM  2  -  MEMBERSHIP  2.1 Status of the Convention"
WCPFC4,14,"The depository for the Convention, New Zealand, presented WCPFC4-2007/06, summarizing the status of the Convention as of 27 October 2007. The only change to the Convention since the last Commission meeting in December 2006 (WCPFC3) was a notification that the Convention entered into force for the USA on 27 July 2007. An accompanying declaration from the USA authorized American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam to participate in the work of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies, in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention. 2.2 Applications for Cooperating Non-members (CNM) status"
WCPFC4,15,"The Executive Director noted that at WCPFC3, applications for CNM status were received from Belize, Indonesia, Senegal and the USA. Indonesia and the USA were granted CNM status at WCPFC3 and the USA has since become a full member. As described in WCPFC4-2007/07, issues for consideration by WCPFC4 included an application for renewal by Indonesia, and new applications by Belize, Ecuador, El Salvador and Senegal. Each applicant was requested to give a brief presentation.    Indonesia"
WCPFC4,16,"Indonesia explained that it is in the process of ratifying the Convention and expects to become a full member of the Commission in 2008. Until that time, Indonesia requested permission to continue participating in the work of the Commission, particularly the ongoing data collection and fishery monitoring programme under the Scientific Committee (SC), as a CNM.  The Chair noted that Indonesia is a coastal State in the Convention Area, with a long record of cooperation with the Commission.    Belize"
WCPFC4,17,"Belize highlighted its participation in several regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), including the IATTC and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) as a CNM. In support of its application it has provided information requested by the Commission as well as additional information contained in WCPFC4-2007/OP5. Belize stated that it has a real interest in the WCPFC Convention Area, which dates from before the formation of the Commission. It noted that the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA) calls upon States to participate in RFMOs and for such participation to be allowed without prejudice.    Ecuador"
WCPFC4,18,"Ecuador’s statement (WCPFC4-2007/OP07) noted that it is a coastal State that has supported tuna fisheries in the WCPO for many years. Ecuador controls its high seas vessels under the international regulatory framework provided for under the UN Convention on the  4 Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and is a contracting party of the IATTC. MCS measures, including 100% observer coverage, are applied in international waters outside of the IATTC’s jurisdiction. Satellite-based vessel monitoring systems (VMSs) will be made mandatory for its entire fishing fleet.     El Salvador"
WCPFC4,19,"A statement from El Salvador (WCPFC4-2007/OP09) explained that its tuna purse-seine fleet consists of four vessels operating throughout the eastern Pacific Ocean. As a member of IATTC, MCS measures such as 100% observer coverage and VMS are applied. The presence of its fishing vessels in the WCPO dates from 2001. El Salvador expressed an interest in applying for full WCPFC membership, if invited, in the future.    Senegal"
WCPFC4,20,"Senegal (WCPFC-2007/OP08) cited its membership in the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and IOTC and the presence of VMSs on every vessel. After Senegal’s unsuccessful application for CNM status at WCPFC3, and after the Commission’s request for Senegal to remove its vessels from the Convention Area, Senegal noted it withdrew its vessels in March and August 2007.    Discussion"
WCPFC4,21,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, offered a flowchart to clarify the process for evaluating CNM applications (WCPFC4-2007/DP20). It was explained that although new procedures for CNM applications had also been put forward in the form of an FFA proposal for revisions to CMM-2004-02 (WCPFC4-2007-DP11), the flowchart is based on the currently applicable guidance contained in CMM-2004-02 and on the Convention. New Zealand, on behalf of FFA, stated that the flowchart should be applied such that all applicants undergo an equivalent evaluation and transparent process. New Zealand went on to note that there is no objection to Indonesia’s application from FFA members. Some delegations expressed reservations with respect to some of the flowchart’s content, and expressed the view that applications should be considered in accordance with CMM 2004-02."
WCPFC4,22,"Several other CCMs noted that while they had no objection to Indonesia’s application, it would possibly now be entering its third year as a CNM and that positive progress towards ratification is now necessary. Concerns were also expressed regarding the participatory rights of applicants should CNM status be conferred, possible impacts on the development aspirations of SIDS, potential overcapacity in light of current concerns regarding the status of WCPO tuna stocks, and implications for the Commission’s MCS activities. Other CCMs stated the importance of separating issues of membership, participatory rights, fishing capacity in the Convention Area, and compliance issues associated with applicants (e.g. illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing), from the need for transparent and fair application of the process outlined in CMM 2004-02. Still other CCMs noted their view that CMM 2004-02 contains the tools to address these concerns given that all CNMs are obligated to comply with the Convention and all CMMs that are in force."
WCPFC4,23,The Commission approved an extension of Indonesia’s CNM application for one-year.       5
WCPFC4,24,"Chinese Taipei presented statements in support of Belize’s and El Salvador’s applications, citing a need for RFMOs to be open and inclusive. The statement noted that, since both States have already been fishing in the WCPF Convention Area, Chinese Taipei supported both States’ applications, noting that both States are cooperating with other RFMOs."
WCPFC4,25,Kiribati presented a statement supporting the applications of Ecuador and El Salvador (WCPFC4-2007/DP29).
WCPFC4,26,"With respect to considerations for the four other CNM applications, the delegate from FSM recalled the Multilateral High Level Conference (MHLC) on South Pacific Tuna Fisheries experience. He noted that in 1999, the MHLC adopted a resolution that sought to place a moratorium on new participants in the MHLC, in an effort to restrict the future membership of the WCPFC. During the MHLC and PrepCon process, participants that are now WCPFC Members were required to make decisions on legitimate and real interest in this region. Considerations at that time included:  • whether they were a coastal State of the region,  • past fishing activities in the Convention Area,  • level of demonstrated and sustained contribution to domestic and regional fisheries research,  • contributions to management and development in the WCPFC region, and • demonstrated responsible fishing practices, including effective exercise of responsibility for its vessels and its nationals and compliance with regional and national conservation and management measures.    The delegate from FSM also noted that decisions taken at that time have shaped the WCPFC membership. Furthermore, the the WCPFC Convention was designed to make it harder for new entrants to become Members, because of problems of overcapacity; also, because unlike other tuna regions, most participants are small island countries for which tuna resources are important. Pursuant to Article 35 of the WCPF Convention, MHLC participants can accede to the Convention at any time, whereas other non-MHLC participant States must be invited to become a Member by a consensus decision of the Commission."
WCPFC4,27,"Because many CCMs requested additional discussion on these issues, the matter was referred to a working group chaired by Sylvie Lapointe (Canada)."
WCPFC4,28,"Subsequent to these discussions, some CCMs noted the importance of supporting the Commission’s own priorities of managing overcapacity and promoting SIDSs’ development, yet acknowledging the rights of States that are not CCMs to fish on the high seas in a responsible manner. These CCMs believed that some of the issues raised with regards to the applications for CNM status were actually issues relating to whether the implementation of the Commission’s management framework was sufficiently robust. Some CCMs articulated the Commission’s duty to encourage cooperation in managing stocks, particularly with States that have a history of fishing in the Convention Area, and to follow open and transparent criteria when considering CNM applications."
WCPFC4,29,"Some CCMs suggested that CNM applications should be considered as an integrated issue, and particular issues of compliance with Commission resolutions and CMMs should be discussed separately.     6"
WCPFC4,30,"Other CCMs considered whether the Commission’s ability to manage fishing capacity in the Convention Area may be jeopardized by denying CNM applications. These CCMs were concerned that the Commission’s tools for managing the fishing activities of non-members are not as robust as its tools for managing the fishing activities of CCMs. In this regard, several CCMs stated that the existing regulation of high seas fishing activities is insufficient and is leading to encroachment of fishing rights within exclusive economic zones (EEZs). Consequently, these CCMs opposed actions that could lead to any further increase in high seas fishing activities."
WCPFC4,31,"Some CCMs stated that CNMs and other non-members should be aware that presently and for the foreseeable future, stocks of yellowfin, bigeye, South and North Pacific albacore, swordfish and striped marlin that are regulated by the WCPFC are fully fished, and that fishing opportunities are therefore limited to new fisheries. In this regard, CNMs and other non-members should note that the WCPFC has agreed to conservation and management measures that limit participation in fisheries for yellowfin, bigeye, South and North Pacific albacore, swordfish and striped marlin."
WCPFC4,32,"Australia, referring to WCPFC4-2007/DP32, reminded CCMs that participation in existing fisheries, including by CNMs, is limited by CMMs applicable to these stocks. Some CCMs expressed support for the concepts in WCPFC4-2007/DP32, while others commented that the format, the summarized nature of the presentation, the interpretation of some provisions of the CMMs, and the relationship of the paper to the CNM application would require further consideration."
WCPFC4,33," Apart from Indonesia, whose application was approved on Monday, final decisions on the applications for CNM status were made on Friday, 7 December."
WCPFC4,34," Prior to the consideration of each application, several CCMs, including the USA and Australia, supported a statement by Canada that expressed the view that each application needs to be considered fairly and objectively in light of criteria set out in CMM-2004-02 and that issues of increased fishing capacity and development aspirations, while very important, should be considered separately. Furthermore, it was expressed that the existing CMM was the only standard for assessing applications, and new rules or standards could not be imposed at WCPFC4."
WCPFC4,35,"Concerning the application for CNM status by Belize, Dr Tsamenyi stated that he had reviewed the application against the legal requirements of CMM-2004-02, and with reference to the insufficiencies of the application identified by the Commission when Belize presented its application for CNM status to WCPFC3. Dr Tsamenyi noted that the application complied with all information requirements but that he was not in a position to comment on the technical quality of the data presented in the application."
WCPFC4,36,The Commission granted Belize CNM status for one-year.
WCPFC4,37,New Zealand inquired as to whether the Chair intended to address the issue of participatory rights for Belize at that point in the meeting.
WCPFC4,38,"When the meeting returned to address this issue, Dr Tsamenyi clarified that under CMM-2004-02, once an application for CNM status is granted, the CNM is subject to all the obligations under existing and future decisions of the Commission. There is no basis under these procedures for differential treatment for a newly admitted CNM unless the CNM agrees  7 to such differential treatment. Dr Tsamenyi noted that amendment to CMM-2004-02 or to CMMs relating to allowable levels of bigeye tuna catches, may need to be undertaken to clarify these issues for future CNM applications but would not apply retrospectively to the decision taken with regards to Belize by WCPFC4."
WCPFC4,39," New Zealand, supported by FSM, insisted that given the status of bigeye stocks and the provision in measure WCPFC 2005-01 calling for no increase in overall fishing effort on bigeye and yellowfin tuna, that Belize be required to limit its catches of bigeye tuna to its average catch  levels over the period 2001–2004, minus any amount that may have been double counted and attributed to coastal States; and that its fishing activities be limited to a total of five longline vessels in the North Pacific and two longline vessels fishing south of 15oS, which are restricted to catching swordfish."
WCPFC4,40,Belize stated that it fully intended to comply with all applicable WCPFC CMMs and would voluntarily limit its annual bigeye tuna catches to 803.25 mt (i.e. its average annual catch over the period 2001–2004). Dr Hampton subsequently confirmed that this figure matched the catch records submitted by Belize to the Commission in support of its application. The Commission noted Belize’s commitment to full compliance and its voluntary limit on its bigeye catches. New Zealand supported this arrangement subject to confirmation that there had been no double counting of Belize’s bigeye catch (to be confirmed by SPC).
WCPFC4,41,"Concerning the application for CNM status by Senegal, Dr Tsamenyi stated that he had reviewed the application against the legal requirements of CMM-2004-02. He stated that the application complied with all information requirements but that he was not in a position to comment on the technical quality of the data presented in the application."
WCPFC4,42,"Canada, the USA and Vanuatu expressed support for Senegal’s application. The EC also spoke in favor of Senegal’s application, noting that it is a coastal State with a tradition of fishing, and a record of cooperation with other RFMOs."
WCPFC4,43,"New Zealand and Niue did not support Senegal’s application, citing CMM-2004-02, paragraphs 5a and 5b, and finding that Senegal had failed to fully comply with the Commission’s request to remove all of its vessels from the Convention Area; and that the current status of fish stocks cannot support any increase in fishing capacity. New Zealand noted that the meeting had not fully discussed the issue of real interest in the fishery, which was relevant to the issue of a State’s right to participate in the fishery. New Zealand considered that there was a clear issue concerning whether Senegal has a real interest in fisheries in the WCPO. In addition, Australia expressed concerns regarding the ability of the Commission to meet the aspirations of new CNMs given the current status of fish stocks and the CMMs currently in place."
WCPFC4,44,"Samoa noted its dissatisfaction with the development and implementation of CMMs to protect fish stocks, and stated that under such conditions it could not support applications for new CNMs at this time."
WCPFC4,45,"Since the decision on CNM status could not be made by consensus, Senegal’s application for CNM status was rejected. The Commission noted that Senegal may bring forward a new application in the future should it so desire."
WCPFC4,46,"Concerning the application for CNM status by Ecuador, Dr Tsamenyi stated that he had reviewed the application against the legal requirements of CMM-2004-02. He stated that  8 the application complied with most of the information requirements but lacked the required information concerning views on ratification of the Convention. He stated that he was not in a position to comment on the technical quality of the data presented in the application."
WCPFC4,47,"Canada, the EC, the USA, Kiribati and Vanuatu expressed support for Ecuador’s application."
WCPFC4,48,"New Zealand opposed Ecuador’s application, citing non-conformance with CMM-2004-02, paras 5, 5c and 9, noting insufficiencies in submitted data; reports by the USA of incursions by Ecuadorian-flagged vessels into the WCPFC Convention Area, including into EEZs; no record of cooperation with WCPFC (e.g. voluntary submission of catch data); an inability of stocks, particularly bigeye tuna, to support additional fishing effort; and failure to demonstrate cooperation with the spirit of IATTC closure periods by simply transferring fishing effort to the same stock in another area."
WCPFC4,49,"The USA clarified that the cases it had reported to the working group concerning Ecuadorian-flagged vessels had been settled, and that cooperation by Ecuador in investigating additional incidents had been satisfactory thus far. The USA indicated that Ecuador’s application should not, therefore, be rejected on this basis."
WCPFC4,50,"Since the decision on CNM status could not be agreed on by consensus, Ecuador’s application for CNM status was rejected. The Commission noted that Ecuador may bring forward a new application in the future should it so desire."
WCPFC4,51,"Concerning the application for CNM status by El Salvador, Dr Tsamenyi stated that he had reviewed the application against the legal requirements of CMM-2004-02. He stated that the application complied with all information requirements but that he was not in a position to comment on the technical quality of the data presented in the application."
WCPFC4,52,"Canada, the EC, the USA, Kiribati and Vanuatu expressed support for El Salvador’s application."
WCPFC4,53,"New Zealand opposed El Salvador’s application on the grounds that the basis for its application was a situation of overcapacity and overfishing in a neighbouring RFMO. It also noted a failure on the part of El Salvador to demonstrate compliance with WCPFC CMMs. New Zealand also expressed a general concern that through mechanisms such as flags of convenience, some CCMs were, in effect, circumventing CMMs by expanding their fishing effort in the WCPO by fishing under the flag of States seeking CNM status."
WCPFC4,54,The EC objected to the reference to a link between flag of convenience issues and CNM applications under consideration by WCPFC4.
WCPFC4,55,"Since the decisions on CNM status could not be made by consensus, El Salvador’s application for CNM status was rejected. The Commission noted that El Salvador may bring forward a new application in the future should it so desire."
WCPFC4,56,"With respect to the rights of unsuccessful applicants to fish within the Convention Area, Dr Tsamenyi explained that under international law, all States have the right to fish on the high seas as long as they discharge their international law duties to cooperate, fish responsibly, and have adequate measures to control their vessels on the high seas through, for example, authorization to fish and effective MCS measures. These States would only lose  9 their rights to fish on the high seas if they act in a manner that is inconsistent with Commission measures. Dr Tsamenyi noted that neither Ecuador nor El Salvador is a party to the UNFSA. Ecuador is not a party to UNCLOS and El Salvador has signed but not ratified UNCLOS. Dr Tsamenyi also noted that there are WCPFC CCMs that have not ratified UNFSA and/or UNCLOS."
WCPFC4,57," New Zealand proposed that a temporary solution might be to allow vessels of El Salvador and Ecuador to continue fishing pursuant to their licences within the Kiribati EEZ, on the basis that such activity would be consistent with the provisions in CNM-2005-01, relating to the management of purse-seine effort within areas under national jurisdiction."
WCPFC4,58,Kiribati requested a special exception from the provisions of CMM-2004-02 in order to continue to authorize the nine purse seiners to continue fishing in Kiribati waters. RMI and New Zealand expressed support for such an exception on the understanding that Kiribati would license the vessels to fish only in the Kiribati EEZ and that no fishing on the high seas in the WCPFC Convention Area would be supported.
WCPFC4,59,"The Commission granted a one-year exemption to Kiribati to allow six Ecuadorian, two El Salvadorean and one Panamanian purse seiners to fish within Kiribati’s EEZ. The Chair requested Kiribati to require these vessels to not fish on the high seas in the WCPF Convention Area."
WCPFC4,60,"The Commission agreed to a derogation to CMM-2004-01 in order to allow these nine vessels to be placed on the Commission’s Record of Fishing Vessels, and to require that these nine vessels be fully monitored under all applicable WCPFC CMMs for one year."
WCPFC4,61,"PNG expressed strong reservations against any actions that would continue to allow fishing in high seas areas just outside EEZs (“high seas pockets”). PNG believes this is leading to illegal incursions into EEZs and loss of coastal State resources, which is preventing the development of SIDS. It requested the Commission to take immediate action to impose compatible management measures on the high seas and in the EEZs of other non-Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) CCMs."
WCPFC4,62,The Commission agreed that providing for compatible management measures for fishing on the high seas was a priority area of work over the coming year (see Agenda Item 13).
WCPFC4,63,"In response to the Commission’s decisions, Ecuador and El Salvador submitted statements to the Commission as WCPFC4-2007/OP14 and WCPFC4-2007/OP15, respectively."
WCPFC4,64,"New Zealand clarified that its reference to flag of convenience issues was not linked to the applications from Ecuador and El Salvador, and apologized for any misunderstandings that may have arisen. New Zealand recognized both parties’ record of compliance with IATTC."
WCPFC4,65,"The Chair noted that it is the nature of the WCPFC to engage in frank, but civil, discussions that reflect the accommodations reached between parties as a result of dealing with a number of contentious issues over the years, and any countries seeking to become Members need to understand how the WCPFC operates.    10 2.3 Applications for observer status"
WCPFC4,66,"The Chair introduced WCPFC4-2007/08, which notes that applications for observer status were received from Chile, Mexico, Thailand, the American Fisheries Research Foundation and Oceana, and that no objections were received to these applications. The Chair noted the terms of participation by these observers under the Commission’s Rules of Procedures. Mexico presented a statement (Attachment I).     AGENDA  ITEM  3  -  MEMBER REPORTS  3.1 Annual Reports by CCMs"
WCPFC4,67,"Part 1 of the Annual Report by CCMs — covering fisheries, research and statistics — was submitted to the Commission for 2006 by 24 CCMs, although 6 reports were outstanding at the time of WCPFC4. Part 2 of the Annual Report by CCMs for 2006 was received from 20 CCMs. In addition to these outstanding reports for 2006, 6 CCMs have yet to submit Annual Reports to the Commission for 2005. The Chair urged all CCMs with outstanding reports to submit them to the Secretariat as soon as possible. New Zealand commented that the Secretariat’s annual reporting guidelines should be regarded as minimum standards, to allow for additional and contextual information to be added if necessary.   3.2 Statements by non-members"
WCPFC4,68,The Chair invited non-members and observers to contribute written statements to be distributed by the Secretariat.    AGENDA  ITEM  4  -  SCIENCE ISSUES  4.1 Report of the Third Regular Session of the Scientific Committee
WCPFC4,69,"Dr Dae-Yeon Moon (Chair of the Scientific Committee, Korea) presented the summary outcomes of the Third Regular Session of the Scientific Committee (SC3) held in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA from 13–24 August 2007. Dr Dae-Yeon Moon advised that Mr Keith Bigelow was recommended by the SC to serve as Vice-Chair through 2009."
WCPFC4,70,"The following issues addressed by SC3 were highlighted (SC3 Summary Report, para 2).   a. A review of fisheries in the WCPO and the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO);  b. A review of yellowfin tuna stocks in the Convention Area as well as northern area stocks, including albacore, Pacific bluefin tuna, striped marlin and swordfish; c. A review of the report on alternative stock status reference points; d. Bycatch mitigation issues and ecological risk assessment;  e. Issues associated with the Regional Observer Programme, data confidentiality and dissemination, the Indonesia and Philippines Data Collection Project, and WCPFC Regional Tuna Tagging Project;   f. Cooperation with other relevant organizations; g. Special requirements of SIDS and territories; h. Future work programme; and i. Administrative matters associated with the functioning of the SC.   11"
WCPFC4,71,"Dr Hampton presented a summary of the status of fisheries for highly migratory species and some of the tuna stocks in the Convention Area (SC3 Summary Report, paras 16–21 and 122–133)."
WCPFC4,72,"Some CCMs raised questions regarding a planned assessment of southwest Pacific swordfish. Australia proposed that this will be a full assessment led by Australia and New Zealand on behalf of the Commission, peer reviewed by SPC, and submitted to SC4 for further review and consideration of management actions. Scientists from all CCMs are encouraged to contribute relevant data analyses and biological insight to the assessment, and an informal workshop is being held at SPC in April 2008 to facilitate this exchange of ideas."
WCPFC4,73,"The Chair noted that although a bigeye tuna assessment will be conducted next year, clear signals of stock status are already available, and thus a CMM will be considered during WCPFC4."
WCPFC4,74,"In response to questions regarding bigeye tuna, Dr Hampton explained that the largest impact on the stock is by longlining, and if management actions were to be restricted to purse seiners, an effort reduction of approximately 75% from 2001–2004 average levels would be required to reduce overall fishing mortality to FMSY levels (MSY=maximum sustainable yields). He also explained that the 2006 stock assessment was based on limited species composition data, particularly with regards to data from Indonesia and the Philippines, and that results may change as data are refined."
WCPFC4,75,"In relation to this point, Indonesia added that it has already begun reforming and further developing its data collection activities at Bitung in north Sulawesi, and that port sampling will be widened to include Sorong in West Papua during the period 2007–2011.   4.2 Response to CMMs"
WCPFC4,76,"Dr Dae-Yeon Moon presented eight responses by SC3 to five existing CMMs for consideration by WCPFC4.    a. Concerning CMM-2006-01, SC3 identified areas of research collaboration with industry on juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna issues and is working to progress these. b. Concerning CMM-2006-02:  i the SC progressed work on minimum technical specifications for seabird mitigation measures (this work was further considered at the Third Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC3) and WCPFC4; see Agenda Item 8); ii new information on mitigation and interactions was reviewed but resulted in no amendments to existing measures; iii an analysis of seabird interactions and mitigation effectiveness will be included in the 2008–2010 work plan.  c. Concerning CMM-2006-03, since there was no stock assessment for southwest Pacific swordfish in 2007, no advice was provided (see para. 73 regarding the impending assessment). d. Concerning CMM-2006-04, since there was no stock assessment for southwest Pacific striped marlin in 2007, no advice was provided.  e. Concerning CMM-2006-05:  i a list of shark species caught in the WCPFC Convention Area was formulated but identification of “key” species was not possible;  12 ii a fin-to-carcass ratio of 5%, as used in CMM 2006-05, was confirmed as reasonable."
WCPFC4,77,The Commission endorsed these eight items of advice from SC3.
WCPFC4,78,"Some CCMs expressed concerns that the CMMs agreed on to date have not resulted in reductions in fishing mortality for bigeye and yellowfin tuna. Concerns were also expressed by FFA members regarding the mixing of politics and science during SC3, and the lack of parity in data provision by some major fishing States in comparison to those being provided by SIDS.   4.3 Advice and recommendations of SC3 to the Commission Stock status and management implications"
WCPFC4,79,"Based on the management advice and implications from SC3 on yellowfin (SC3 Summary Report, paras 126–128), the recommendation to reduce fishing mortality rate on yellowfin from the current level was accepted by the Commission. Australia noted that MSY-based reference points are not particularly precautionary and are generally considered to be limited reference points, rather than targets. Australia suggested that a target biomass of 20% above BMSY should be applied."
WCPFC4,80,"Management recommendations for bigeye tuna, South Pacific albacore, southwest Pacific swordfish, and southwest Pacific striped marlin from SC2, and for WCPO skipjack from SC1, were considered by SC3 to be still current (SC3 Summary Report, paras 122, 130, 132, 133, 129, respectively), and were endorsed by the Commission to be carried out over the coming year. In response to a question regarding the possibility that high levels of recruitment in bigeye tuna in recent years are an artifact of the stock assessment model, Dr Hampton explained this may be linked to an (as yet) unidentified environmental factor. He noted that similarly high levels of recruitment were found when the IATTC assessed bigeye tuna in the EPO but that a recent series of low recruitment years, and relatively high fishing pressure, have caused the stock status to change considerably. A discussion on the conservation and management measures relating to this stock was deferred to Agenda Item 8."
WCPFC4,81,"The conservation advice from the ISC that fishing mortality for North Pacific albacore should not be increased from its current level (Fcurrent (2002–2004) = 0.75) and that with the projection based on the continued current high F the fishing mortality rate will have to be reduced ,was recommended to the Commission for endorsement by SC3 (SC3 Summary Report, para 140 and 163). WCPFC4 endorsed this recommendation."
WCPFC4,82,"The conservation advice from the ISC that fishing mortality for Pacific bluefin tuna should not be increased above recent levels as a precautionary measure until the next stock assessment in 2008, was recommended to the Commission for endorsement by SC3 (SC3 Summary Report, paras 146–152). WCPFC4 endorsed this recommendation."
WCPFC4,83,"Concerning North Pacific striped marlin, SC3 received the conservation advice from the ISC that the fishing mortality rate of striped marlin should be reduced from the current level (2003 or before), taking into consideration various factors associated with this species and its fishery (SC3 Summary Report, paras 156 and 163). The Chair noted that spawning biomass in 2003 was estimated to be 14–15% of the 1970 level, depending on the model scenario used. The USA explained that while significant reduction in fishing mortality  13 appears warranted, this issue is complicated for a proper recommendation by the fact that this species is not a target species of the fisheries that catch it, and the fact that is has not been designated as a northern stock. As a solution for the Northern Committee to develop recommendations, this species should be designated as a northern stock for the Northern Committee be tasked to do the work that should then be presented to the SC and the Commission for further consideration. Further discussion of this issue was deferred to Agenda Item 6.    Review of reference points"
WCPFC4,84,"WCPFC’s Science Manager, Sung-Kwon Soh, made a summary presentation on the Commission’s consultancy report, “Investigation of Alternative Stock Status Reference Points” (SC3-ME-WP-3). The Commission acknowledged and endorsed the recommendations of SC3 with respect to a future work programme on reference points, involving the development of a scoping paper and work plan, and addressing technical and organizational issues associated with implementation (SC3, Summary Report paras 169–170)."
WCPFC4,85,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA, noted that although FFA members endorse these recommendations, the following issues should be considered by the scoping paper:. a.   The work plan should include a strategy to include wide participation of CCMs, particularly by Pacific Island representatives; b.   For the development of a management strategy evaluation (MSE), consider performance indicators that are relevant to both stock conservations and socioeconomic benefits derived from fisheries, including the distribution of benefits; c.   The application of the MSE should be done using a staged approach, first applying to a single species such as North and South Pacific albacore so that CCMs can become familiar with the concepts and issues in a relatively simple case study; and d.   The scoping paper should include work needed for the preparation of interim management strategies."
WCPFC4,86,"In addition, New Zealand suggested the need for consideration of revised institutional arrangements for the Commission, such as a fisheries management working group for systematic analyses and discussions focusing on reference points, management objectives, strategies and measures."
WCPFC4,87,"Some CCMs, while not disputing the usefulness of the report, cited it as an example of a lack of transparency or full participation, and requested the Commission to be fair and transparent in the scientific activities of the Commission. In relation to the second item suggested by New Zealand, two divergent views were expressed on the inclusion or not of the socioeconomic factors in this scoping study as a work of the SC, and in the end no guidelines were offered on this issue by the Commission."
WCPFC4,88,"The Commission acknowledged and endorsed the recommendations of SC3 with respect to a future work programme on reference points, involving development of a scoping paper and work plan, and addressing technical and organizational issues associated with implementation.     14 Bycatch mitigation"
WCPFC4,89,"The Commission endorsed SC3’s recommendation to require data collection and reporting, through the Annual Report to the Commission, of shark catches to the lowest possible taxonomic level (SC3 Summary Report, para 197)."
WCPFC4,90,"Palau expressed reservations regarding the practicality of implementing accurate shark catch recording in cases where fins and carcasses are stored separately and DNA testing is not economically feasible. It also offered its view that since its national laws already require this level of specificity for shark recording, in this case, the use of observers would not substantially improve data collection with respect to species identification."
WCPFC4,91,"The SC assisted with providing information on the specification, further development and refinement of measures to mitigate seabird bycatch (SC3 Summary Report, paras 191 and 192).  This work was progressed by the TCC (TCC3 Summary Report, paras 99–106 and Attachment F) and continued under a working group at WCPFC4 chaired by Mr Robert Martinolich (Canada). The outcomes of the small working group are presented under Agenda Item 8."
WCPFC4,92,"SC3’s consideration of strategies to reduce sea turtle interactions resulted in consensus on a list of tools and techniques available for safely releasing hooked turtles (SC3 Summary Report, paragraphs 209–213). A list of measures to reduce the capture or injury of turtles while maintaining target species catches required further discussion under a working group convened at WCPFC4 by Mr Ray Clarke (USA) and presented under Agenda Item 8."
WCPFC4,93,"Several CCMs commented on the need to maintain consistency between seabird and sea turtle bycatch mitigation measures required by the WCPFC, and those required by other RFMOs.  While some CCMs stressed the need to harmonize measures, others advocated a more cautious approach in order to avoid reducing all measures to the lowest common denominator. There was consensus that the specifics of each interaction issue would need to be considered and that a universal solution might not be applicable to all gear types and fisheries."
WCPFC4,94,"SC3 recommended an eight-part research programme, including industry-associated research, to support measures to reduce mortality of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna (SC3 Report, para 208). The Commission endorsed this recommendation."
WCPFC4,95,"The SC’s recommendation to extend the ecological risk assessment (ERA) project through 2010 (SC3 Summary Report, paras 230–236) was adopted by the Commission."
WCPFC4,96,"PNG noted that SIDS are not particularly well-informed on this topic. In order to improve understanding and participation, US$ 50,000 has been granted by PNG for an ERA training programme for FFA members facilitated through the SPC-OFP.    Data and information"
WCPFC4,97,"SC3 recommended endorsement of six scientific objectives to be considered in the development of the Commission’s Regional Observer Programme (ROP) (given in Appendix II of the Statistics Specialist Working Group (SWG) Report, in the SC3 Summary Report). A related recommendation was that Appendix III of the Statistics SWG Report be used as the starting point for future discussions on minimum scientific data to be collected by the ROP,  15 that these minimum data fields be annotated with their meaning, purpose and format (SC3 Summary Report, paras 237–245). The Commission endorsed these recommendations."
WCPFC4,98,"Recommendations concerning access to and dissemination of data compiled by the Commission, and immediate implementation of the Information Security Policy, were forwarded to the Commission by SC3 for approval (SC3 Summary Report, paras 250, 251 and 253). These recommendations were also endorsed by the Commission."
WCPFC4,99,"The SC recommended continued work on the Indonesia and Philippines Data Collection Project (IPDCP), with additional funding support from the Commission for the activities under the IPDCP (SC3 Summary Report, para 255). The Commission endorsed this recommendation."
WCPFC4,100,"Some CCMs expressed some unease regarding the continued lack of detail in the data from Indonesia and the Philippines. One CCM referred specifically to doubts about the ongoing requirements of the Commission to support data-related work in the Philippines — particularly since it appeared that the Philippines had funds to commit to review data-related issues as indicated in their WCPFC4 Opening Statement (WCPFC4-2007-DP22). Dr Hampton stated that he believes the Commission should continue to support this work in both Indonesia and the Philippines, and that much of the cost was for port sampling and fishery monitoring, rather than merely historical data review. The Philippines noted a savings of US$ 6,253.66 from the previous budget, which it will carry over to next year as approved by the IPDCP Steering Committee (IPDCP-SC)."
WCPFC4,101,"Following the adoption of the Pacific Tuna Tagging Programme (PTTP) at WCPFC3, and subsequent to the positive review of the Project Document that was prepared for SC3 by the PTTP Steering Committee, the Commission encouraged CCMs to contribute voluntary funding support for Phase II of the PTTP (SC3 Summary Report, para 273). The Commission noted with appreciation, valuable contributions from New Zealand (NZ$ 5 million) and PNG (an additional US$ 100,000) to the project. Approximately US$ 6.4 million has been raised to date, meaning that an additional US$ 3.4 million is still required. Dr Hampton provided a presentation in which he highlighted that Phase I of the project, which received funding support from Australia, the European Community, France, New Zealand, PNG and the Global Environment Fund, had been an outstanding success, with high release numbers of skipjack and yellowfin (~ 70,000) and more than 7,000 recaptures reported to date. Phase II will focus on tagging in the western tropical Pacific, including, if possible, Indonesia and the Philippines using a pole-and-line vessel appropriately adapted for tagging. Dr Hampton explained that this work is expected to provide excellent information on stock dynamics, recent exploitation levels and, through an archival tagging component of the project, vertical migrations of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna, which could be useful for mitigation of catches of those species."
WCPFC4,102," New Zealand commented that while it was pleased to be able to provide significant funding for Phase II of the PTTP, it would like to see WCPFC incorporate the ability to resource such critical research into its core programme and budget, as well as explore ways that costs could be internalized within the fishing industry exploiting the resources."
WCPFC4,103,"The SC recommended that in order to address important gaps in data submitted to the Commission, a prototype computer program for tracking CCM data submissions be developed and a study into the causes of the gaps be initiated (SC3 Summary Report, para 279).  The Commission endorsed this recommendation noting that a prototype system for  16 tracking data submissions is already established on the WCPFC website. The Finance and Administration Committee (FAC) subsequently endorsed an allocation of US$ 15,000 to support this work."
WCPFC4,104," The SC recommended that the guidelines for scientific data to be provided to the Commission be those documented in Appendix IV of the SC3 Statistics SWG Report, with further consideration at the Commission on the one square-bracketed paragraph (SC3 Summary Report, paras 281–282). The Commission agreed all other paragraphs except the square-bracketed paragraph, and agreed to adopt the document “Scientific Data to be provided to the Commission” after the square-bracketed paragraph was resolved before the end of the meeting (see Agenda Item 7, para 235 below)."
WCPFC4,105,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, reiterated concerns regarding a lack of operational level catch and effort, port sampling and observer data provision by some large, developed CCMs when SIDS are able to provide such data. The Chair responded that all CCMs are required to provide data to the same standard as described in the SC3 Summary Report, Attachment K “Standards for the Provision of Operational Level Catch and Effort Data”.      Special requirements of small island developing States (SIDS)"
WCPFC4,106,"SC3 also recommended the continuation of stock assessment workshops for SIDS provided by SPC-OFP (SC3 Summary Report, para 302). The Commission also endorsed this recommendation.  Administrative matters"
WCPFC4,107,"SC3 provided advice and received Commission endorsement on five administrative matters  (SC3 Summary Report, paras 321, 329, 331 and 332) including : a. Use a scoping document contained at SC3 Summary Report, Attachment P, to initiate an independent review of science structure and functions of the Commission;  b. Continue use of the existing format for Part 1 Annual Report pending further consideration of a possible revision at SC4; c. Accept PNG’s offer to host SC4 at Port Moresby from 11–22 August 2008;  d. Fully assess WCPO bigeye tuna (with consideration given to a possible Pacific-wide bigeye tuna stock assessment with IATTC), South Pacific albacore; and WCPO skipjack (2008/2009)."
WCPFC4,108,"With regard to these administrative matters, the Chair noted that the independent review of interim arrangements for the Commission’s science structure and function, once completed, can be used to inform the performance review of the Commission being promoted under the joint tuna RFMO performance review exercise. Some CCMs expressed a view that it will be critical to ensure the reviewers are independent and, thus, preferably not from CCMs.   4.4 SC 2008 work programme"
WCPFC4,109,"Dr Dae-Yeon Moon presented the SC’s Programme of Work for 2008 (SC3 Summary Report, Attachment O), explaining that out of the original list of 50–60 proposals, nine high priority projects were selected for the Commission’s funding in 2008:    17 a. Indonesia and Philippines Data Collection Project; b. Publication and distribution of Commission training and educational materials; c. Revised stock assessment of southwest Pacific swordfish; d. Refinement of bigeye parameters Pacific-wide; e. Regional study of the stock structure and life history characteristics of South Pacific albacore; f. Pacific-wide tagging project; g. ERA, including a productivity and susceptibility assessment (PSA); h. Characterization of species, size composition and spatial distribution of tunas aggregating around floating objects using underwater videos and other tools; and i. Development of a scoping paper, and draft work plan, on the potential costs, benefits and difficulties of alternative approaches for identification of appropriate reference points and implementation of an MSE within the WCPO."
WCPFC4,110,These projects were endorsed by the Commission.
WCPFC4,111,"One CCM expressed concern regarding the fact that the proposed swordfish and albacore studies, while predominantly supported by external funding from CCMs’ individual budgets, required a minor contribution from the Commission budget. It was felt that establishing a precedent for such co-funding was inadvisable, and that if projects have merit they should be carried out even without a Commission contribution. Other CCMs noted that the Commission’s contribution was very small relative to the total project budget (6% for swordfish and 12% for albacore), and that such cooperative funding is fiscally wise given the Commission’s restricted funding environment."
WCPFC4,112,"A final item in the SC work plan and budget was the provision of approximately US$ 60,000 as unallocated budget for unforeseen costs, exchange rate variability and inflation. Some CCMs considered that such unallocated funds are a useful hedge against unanticipated costs, while other CCMs considered it unnecessary and poor practice. The Chair clarified that the unallocated amount does not appear in the 2008 budget and is provisionally allocated for 2009 and 2010."
WCPFC4,113,"It was also clarified that these projects, once approved, will be subject to decisions in the FAC regarding prioritization and budget limitations. In particular, while it would not be appropriate for the FAC to attempt to revise the individual project budgets, it would be within the FAC’s authority to reduce the number of projects in order to meet an agreed budget target.  Japan, having expressed continuing concerns regarding budget issues, consented to agree to the list of proposed projects on the understanding that their initiation would be subject to the final deliberations of the FAC and Commission sessions at WCPFC4 (see Agenda Item 10)."
WCPFC4,114,"Finally, several CCMs raised concerns regarding the transparency of the budget and the apparent ad hoc nature of its development process within the SC. The Chair asked the SC to address this concern in next year’s SC budgeting process."
WCPFC4,115,"PNG, on behalf of FFA, suggested that the budget of US$ 650,000 for 2008 be used as a minimum budget for the 2009 and 2010 fiscal years.     18"
WCPFC4,116,"The Commission expressed gratitude and appreciation to SPC for its work over the last 12 months, and thanked the Chairman of the SC, Dr Dae-Yeon Moon.    AGENDA  ITEM  5  -  NORTHERN COMMITTEE  5.1 Report of the Third Regular Session of the Northern Committee"
WCPFC4,117,"Mr Ben Tabios of the Philippines (Vice-Chair of the Northern Committee) presented a Summary Report of the Third Regular Session of the Northern Committee (NC3), which was held 11–13 September 2007 in Tokyo, Japan. Eight members and several observers attended NC3, including Vanuatu, which was admitted as a member of the NC at the end of NC3. Discussions focused on stock status of North Pacific albacore, Pacific bluefin, North Pacific swordfish, and North Pacific striped marlin as informed by submissions from the Seventh Plenary Session of the ISC (ISC7).   5.2 Response to CMMs North Pacific albacore"
WCPFC4,118,"Taking into account the ISC7 report, the NC agreed to maintain the existing CMM that requires CCMs to not increase fishing effort for North Pacific albacore."
WCPFC4,119,"RMI, on behalf of FFA members, expressed support for the advice of NC3 with regards to North Pacific albacore. The Commission endorsed the recommendation from NC3.   5.3 Advice and recommendations of NC3 to the Commission Pacific bluefin tuna"
WCPFC4,120,"Noting the uncertainty in the stock assessment, NC3 advised its members to voluntarily not increase the fishing mortality rate of Pacific bluefin tuna, and to collect and submit data to facilitate the stock assessment."
WCPFC4,121,"RMI, on behalf of FFA members, expressed support for the advice of NC3 with regards to Pacific bluefin tuna. The Commission endorsed the recommendation from NC3.      North Pacific swordfish"
WCPFC4,122,"On the basis that a stock assessment is not anticipated until 2009, the NC considered that no action was required with respect to North Pacific swordfish at this time.  Status of striped marlin as a northern stock"
WCPFC4,123,"NC3 noted SC3’s outcome that, based on the lack of presented information on the distribution of the biomass of this stock, it could not support designation of striped marlin as a “northern stock”. NC3 requested that the Commission renew its request to the SC to review all available information on this issue. The ISC is invited to provide relevant information to the SC in relation to this matter."
WCPFC4,124,Several CCMs expressed the view that striped marlin does not appear to meet the criteria for designation as a northern stock.  19  Conservation considerations for striped marlin
WCPFC4,125,"Based on the recent ISC stock assessment, NC3 advised its members to make voluntary efforts to avoid increasing current fishing mortality rates on striped marlin."
WCPFC4,126,"In preparation for developing an effective CMM, NC3 recommended that the Commission task the NC with convening a working group to examine the effects of fishery management measures already taken; spatial and temporal patterns of striped marlin catches and catchability; behavioural and technological methods for reducing incidental catches; methods for reducing catchability; and ways to encourage fishermen to develop and comply with practical measures; all to be considered at the next SC and NC meetings."
WCPFC4,127,"The Commission requested that the NC form such a working group with a view towards developing a draft CMM, with SPC and FFA input, for consideration by the SC at SC4."
WCPFC4,128,"Some CCMs cited their concerns about the apparent stock status and the lack of conservation and management actions. In addition, New Zealand and the Chair raised questions as to the transparency of the ISC assessment and lack of review of the actual assessment by the SC, with New Zealand emphasizing the importance of ISC assessments being presented in full to the SC for review."
WCPFC4,129,"Japan considered that this issue is broader than the striped marlin assessment, and instead relates to the planned review of interim arrangements for the science structure and function of the Commission.   5.4 NC 2008 work programme"
WCPFC4,130,"Mr Tabios noted that existing biological data for North Pacific stocks was old information and that additional biological data are urgently required to reduce uncertainties. Given that Mexico catches a significant number of Pacific bluefin tuna but does not participate in the NC, greater cooperation with IATTC is anticipated for the future."
WCPFC4,131,Mexico expressed a strong interest in cooperating with the Northern Committee and in participating in management decisions for northern stocks.
WCPFC4,132,The Commission endorsed the work programme to be supported by members of the NC for the period 2008–2010.  AGENDA  ITEM  6  -  TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE  6.1 Report of the Third Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee
WCPFC4,133,"The Third Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC3) was held in Pohnpei, FSM from 27 September–2 October 2007. A summary of the session was presented by Mr Wendell Sanford (Canada) who, as Vice-Chair of the TCC, acted as Chair of the meeting due to the resignation of the Chair Feleti Teo (Tuvalu). At the close of the meeting, Mr Sanford resigned as Vice-Chair and was nominated as Chair. Mr Noan Pakop of PNG was nominated as Vice-Chair.     20 Regional Observer Programme (ROP)"
WCPFC4,134,"Dr Charles Karnella (USA) chaired an Inter-sessional Working Group on the ROP (IWG-ROP) prior to TCC3. The report of this working group is contained at WCPFC4-2007/13, Attachment 4, and the output of this working group forms Attachment D to the TCC3’s Summary Report. Dr Karnella reported that although there are many areas of progress on the ROP, an implementation schedule has yet to be formulated, costing arrangements were yet to be agreed upon, and the types and sizes of vessels to be included in the scheme have yet to be defined."
WCPFC4,135,"Mr Sanford highlighted paras 18 and 35 of the TCC3 Summary Report as containing the recommendations in regard to ROP. He noted that pursuant to para 30 of the TCC3 Summary Report, Canada funded the preparation of a legal opinion on liability and insurance issues associated with onboard fisheries observers, which is presented as WCPFC4-2007/IP10."
WCPFC4,136,"Several CCMs consider the ROP to be a critical element of the Commission’s MCS structure; without which, CMMs cannot be monitored or enforced, and IUU fishing activities combated. These parties favor preliminary implementation of the ROP, using existing regional and sub-regional observer programmes as an initial framework for implementation from 1 January 2008."
WCPFC4,137,"Several other CCMs expressed a differing view regarding the prioritization of the ROP, given other Commission work items, budgetary constraints and the severe time limits of Commission staff.  Some of these CCMs consider that there are still significant issues to be resolved, for example the coverage rate and applicability to small-scale vessels before implementation of the ROP can be agreed on."
WCPFC4,138,"There was, however, consensus that development of the draft CMM should continue on the margins of WCPFC4 via a working group. The Chair tasked Dr Karnella with leading this working group in an attempt to formulate an agreement to implement elements of existing regional or sub-regional observer programmes as a forerunner to the ROP. It was noted that a further physical meeting of the IWG-ROP, perhaps in April or May, 2008 might be necessary to begin integrating other elements of the ROP. China and New Zealand indicated a preference for the IWG-ROP to be held immediately prior to TCC4 in September 2008."
WCPFC4,139,Further work during WCPFC4 on the development of the draft CMM for the ROP is presented under Agenda Item 8.1.    Vessel monitoring system
WCPFC4,140,"Mr Sanford highlighted para 52 of the TCC3 Summary Report, which commits to presenting scenarios for a proposed vessel monitoring system (VMS) budget to WCPFC4. A presentation by Mr Iain Hayes, consultant to the Secretariat, identified two basic scenarios:  location of the system at Pohnpei or co-hosting of the system in another fully-supported environment. Within the second scenario, there are three options: a dedicated site (Commission VMS only), a shared site (with another VMS), and co-location with the FFA VMS in Sydney, Australia (the “Pacific VMS” option). Under the assumptions used in the analysis, the Pacific VMS option is significantly less costly to install, saving about US$  21 750,000, relative to the Pohnpei option. This saving is equivalent to operating costs for three years."
WCPFC4,141,"Mr David Marx (New Zealand) presented paras 53–62 of the TCC report, which relate to the Commission’s VMS. The Commission endorsed TCC’s recommendation for formation of a VMS Working Group, using Attachment A to WCPFC TCC3 2007/12 (Supplementary) as its terms of reference, to establish the standards, specifications and procedures for the Commission VMS as called for in the Convention."
WCPFC4,142,"The Commission endorsed the outcomes of the VMS Working Group to date (Attachment E of TCC3’s summary outcome report) and directed them to continue to work (intersessionally and electronically wherever possible) to develop actual draft standards, specifications and procedures for the consideration of TCC4, and WCPFC5 in 2008. The Commission endorsed a budget of up to US$ 10,000 for the use of the Secretariat in support of this work. Mr Marx will continue to lead the VMS Working Group in 2008."
WCPFC4,143,"Mr Marx highlighted that there were two parallel processes currently underway. The first is the domain of the VMS Working Group in developing standards, specifications and procedures for the use of the Commission VMS, and the second is the physical development of the Commission VMS. The Commission noted that in accordance with CMM 2006/06, both processes will be concluded and the Commission VMS should be in a position to be operable 60 days after WCPFC5."
WCPFC4,144," Mr Marx indicated that he intended to circulate a “chair’s draft” early in 2008, articulating potential elements for the remaining terms of reference for the working group, with the view to using this paper to seek comments from the group to develop agreed upon elements that may be used in the formulation of a complete set of draft standards, specifications and procedures by the Secretariat."
WCPFC4,145,"The material prepared through the Secretariat would then be circulated to the working group for comments, in advance of TCC4. Mr Marx noted that there may be a need for the working group to meet immediately prior to TCC4, and in the margins of that meeting, to work on these documents and that such time should be made available. The Commission endorsed this suggested approach."
WCPFC4,146,"A small working group, convened by Mr Glenn Joseph (RMI) during WCPFC4, discussed WCPFC4-2007/25 as the basis for selecting the preferred option for the Commission VMS. After careful consideration of the options, it was agreed that the option of co-locating the Commission’s VMS with FFA’s VMS in Sydney, Australia (i.e. the Pacific VMS option) was clearly superior in terms of capital and operating costs, and would meet all performance standards. Therefore, the group recommended selecting the Pacific VMS option as the basis for further development. The report of the working group is appended as Attachment J. The Commission endorsed the group’s recommendation."
WCPFC4,147,"In response to a query from Japan, the Chair and the Secretariat clarified that there is no intention to move any Commission function and staff associated with the VMS (or not) to locations outside of FSM. Japan stated its support for the VMS co-location options with an understanding that they were merely technical outsourcing options and would not change the functioning of the Commission and its Secretariat.     22"
WCPFC4,148,"On the issue of costs, one CCM questioned why three Commission positions were proposed to support the VMS. The Chair clarified that the volume of vessel reporting will be high and that based on the experience at FFA, one professional and two technical staff will be needed."
WCPFC4,149,"Several FFA members expressed support for the co-location of the Commission and FFA’s VMS, citing its compatibility, cost effectiveness, practicality, and speed of installation. Other FFA members supported co-hosting in general but needed more time to consider the implications of co-locating with FFA’s VMS."
WCPFC4,150,"Some CCMs commented on technical specifications of the VMS, including issues of how to ensure data security and confidentiality, particularly in relation to maintaining completely separate FFA and WCPFC systems; how to prevent vessels from undermining the system; issues associated with non-reporting and whether, under co-hosted options, there would be any problems with remote access to data."
WCPFC4,151,"With regards to the criteria used to determine which vessels would be required to participate in the Commission’s VMS, Indonesia explained that it has required VMS since 2005 but only on those vessels exceeding 60 gross tonnes. Palau considered that the VMS must apply to small vessels since nearly all of its vessels would be below that size. The US stated that VMS units are installed on US vessels as small as 10 m. Guam commented that perhaps vessel range, rather than size, would be a more useful criterion for whether VMS participation should be required."
WCPFC4,152,Further work during WCPFC4 on the implementation of CMM-2006-06 for the VMS is presented under Agenda Item 8.1.    Draft CMM for transhipment monitoring
WCPFC4,153,"As a result of intersessional work since TCC3 (see TCC3 Summary Report, paras 74–76), a draft CMM for transhipment monitoring was jointly prepared by Australia and Japan (WCPFC4-2007/DP03 Rev.2). A second proposal, developed by RMI (WCPFC4-2007/DP08), was tabled for consideration at the Commission."
WCPFC4,154,"CCMs discussed transhipment monitoring in broad terms. Views ranged along a spectrum, from those proposing to ban all transhipment at sea, to those wishing to allow the continuance of all existing transhipment operations."
WCPFC4,155,"Those CCMs who proposed to allow transhipment at sea looked to the factors defined in TCC3 Summary Report para 75 as elements of a transhipment measure. They cited the importance of compatibility with other RFMOs that allow such activities, and consistency with the WCPF Convention text. These CCMs proposed a variety of MCS tools, including observers and VMS, for verifying transhipment operations. Most stated that requirements to tranship in ports results in fishing operations that are not economically viable. One CCM stated that definitions of “in port” could be problematic when transhipment occurs within reefs or other inland waters rather than in port. Another CCM stated that the Convention does not explicitly call for the banning of all transhipment at sea."
WCPFC4,156,"CCMs who expressed a strong stance against permitting high seas transhipment varied on whether they might allow transhipment within EEZs or only within ports. However, they shared a scepticism that VMS and observers could be effective in transhipment monitoring,  23 and believed if verification is not technically possible then bans are an option. Many CCMs believed that a requirement to tranship in port would bring economic benefits to ports and encourage their development."
WCPFC4,157,"Following permission by the Commission to speak, Greenpeace stated its support for a ban on transhipment at sea, citing it as a major loophole for IUU fishing as shown in their report on FSM and Kiribati."
WCPFC4,158,"The Chair urged parties to work towards a consensus proposal during WCPFC4. It was noted that in the absence of a CMM on transhipment, under the Convention a ban on purse-seine transhipment on the high seas will apply except for a one-year exemption for the Philippines and FFA members."
WCPFC4,159,Further work during WCPFC4 on the development of the draft CMM for transhipment is presented under Agenda Item 8.1.    Port State measures
WCPFC4,160,"Mr Sanford referred to para 82 of the TCC3 Summary Report, which notes that FAO is developing an international port State measures instrument that, as part of the process, will include a technical consultation on port State measures in 2008. Partially for this reason, TCC3 recommended deferring this issue to TCC4."
WCPFC4,161,"Without objection to the recommendation, several CCMs who are also FFA members, voiced their support for port State measures and urged the TCC’s work not be slowed by any delays that might be associated with an attempt to align with the FAO process."
WCPFC4,162,The Commission agreed to defer consideration of port State measures to TCC4.    Vessel chartering schemes
WCPFC4,163,"CCMs were reminded that the recommendation of TCC3 was to defer action on this issue to TCC4 (TCC Summary Report, para 87)."
WCPFC4,164,"Japan considered that charter arrangements could be important development tools for SIDS. However, it noted that, without charter guidelines approved by the Commission, it faces difficulties to supporting efforts by the Japanese fishing industry to promote charter arrangements in the WCPO because of the issues associated with ensuring compliance with applicable CMMs."
WCPFC4,165,The Commission agreed to defer consideration of vessel chartering schemes to TCC4.    Catch documentation schemes
WCPFC4,166,"The final MCS item discussed by TCC3 was catch documentation schemes (CDSs) (see TCC3 Summary Report, para 91). In support of this topic, FFA circulated WCPFC4-2007/DP24, which contains a proposal on harmonization and improvement of trade tracking programmes by Canada, the EC and the USA from the RFMO technical working group in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Commenting on this proposal, Canada noted that WCPFC is the only RFMO with no tuna document programme.     24"
WCPFC4,167,"Australia, on behalf of FFA, noted that previous proposals submitted to WCPFC on this topic have not been sufficiently comprehensive nor integrated with other essential MCS components. These CCMs support the formation of an interesessional working group to examine the experience of other RFMOs and how it can be applied to the WCPFC."
WCPFC4,168,"The EC introduced its new proposals for trade tracking and legal provenance verification of fish products,1 stating that the goal of these procedures is not to restrict trade but to discourage IUU fishing. The EC offered to develop a proposed CDS for bigeye tuna based on the joint proposal submitted to the Raleigh meeting by Canada, the USA and the EU. In response to a question from the Chair regarding whether the EC’s new measures will apply to EC vessels’ landings, the EC clarified that products generated by EC fishing operations will be regulated under a separate revised control regulation."
WCPFC4,169,"Japan voiced its doubt regarding the need for and effectiveness of CDSs in the WCPO, adding that the specific points raised in Japan’s paper (TCC3-2007/DP-06) need further consideration."
WCPFC4,170,Further work during WCPFC4 on the development of a CDS is presented under Agenda Item 8.1.   6.2 Response to CMMs Record of Fishing Vessels and Authorization to Fish (CMM-2004-01)
WCPFC4,171,"TCC3 made several recommendations to the Commission regarding vessel information provided to the Secretariat as part of the Commission’s Record of Fishing Vessels. One recommendations was for CCMs to provide all the required information and advise the Executive Director of changes to their respective Records of Fishing Vessels as required in CMM 2004-01. Another recommendation was to add an “active/inactive vessel in the Convention Area” field in the Record of Fishing Vessels (TCC3 Summary Report, paras 136–138). The Chair noted the particular importance of the latter recommendation in providing an accurate measure of existing activity."
WCPFC4,172,"Most CCMs expressed general support for the TCC3 recommendations for both administrative and scientific reasons. They acknowledged the need to distinguish between those vessels that are authorized to fish, and those that are actually active in the Convention Area.  Australia announced that it had prepared a proposal to establish a list of such active vessels.  Discussion of this occurred under Agenda Item 8."
WCPFC4,173,"Several CCMs indicated concerns with the potential for the Record of Fishing Vessels to be used to determine capacity, calculate operational days, or provide other management input.  These CCMs believe that the details of how, and which data to be used in such management considerations, should be deferred for later specification."
WCPFC4,174,Further work during WCPFC4 on the development of revisions to CMM-2004-01 on the Record of Fishing Vessels and Authorization to Fish is presented under Agenda Item 8.1.                                                      1 See http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/external_relations/illegal_fishing_en.htm   25  Temporary Register of Carrier and Bunker Vessels (CMM-2004-01)
WCPFC4,175,"The TCC recommended that the temporary register of non-CCM flag carrier and bunker vessels be extended until 31 December 2008 (TCC3 Summary Report, paras 151–153).  The Chair noted that a draft CMM on this issue will be presented by RMI (WCPFC4-2007-DP09) under Agenda Item 8.1.    Fishing Activities of non-CCM Flagged Vessels in the Convention Area (CMM-2004-01)"
WCPFC4,176,"The matter of non-CCM flagged vessels fishing in the Convention Area was discussed by TCC3 but not resolved (TCC3 Summary Report, para 141)."
WCPFC4,177,"Kiribati stated that its decision to license non-CCM flagged vessels to fish in Kiribati waters was taken under circumstances of extreme economic hardship and was not intended to flaunt the regulations of the Commission. To remedy the situation, Kiribati asked the flag States and owners to join the Commission as CNMs. Kiribati noted the vessels have shown good compliance with license requirements."
WCPFC4,178,"The Kiribati-licensed vessels consist of six Ecuadorian vessels, two El Salvadorean vessels and one Panamanian vessel, all of which are purse seiners. Because Ecuador’s and El Salvador’s applications for CNM status were unsuccessful, none of these States will be CNMs during 2008."
WCPFC4,179,"Dr Tsamenyi explained that UNCLOS grants sovereign rights to all coastal States to decide which parties they allow to fish within their EEZs, provided the fishing activities are not inconsistent with the conservation and management obligations of the coastal State. However, CMM 2004-01, under which CCMs have committed to allowing only CCMs to fish in their EEZs, has limited those sovereign rights. Therefore, CCMs that allow a non-CCM to fish in their EEZ are in violation of Commission measures and the Convention."
WCPFC4,180,"New Zealand noted that as Chair of the Forum Fisheries Committee (FFC), the New Zealand Minister of Fisheries had written to Kiribati to highlight the importance of regional solidarity and express concern that Kiribati’s actions undermine effective management of the resources by both FFA members and by WCPFC, which will result in a loss of economic benefits to the whole region.     Bigeye and Yellowfin Tuna in the WCPO (CMM-2005-01 and CMM-2006-01)"
WCPFC4,181,"TCC3 recommended that in 2008, the Secretariat include in its Annual Report compliance with all data reporting obligations, and noted the information provided by the Commission Data Manager in relation to CMM-2005-01 and CMM-2006-01.    Annual reports to the Commission"
WCPFC4,182,"TCC3 requested that the Secretariat develop a discussion paper on reporting compliance with CMMs. Several FFA member CCMs, including the Cook Islands, PNG, Samoa and Australia, spoke in favor of improved compliance reporting.     26"
WCPFC4,183,China and the EC expressed their view that the responsibility for evaluating compliance should lie with the TCC rather than the Secretariat.
WCPFC4,184,"In response to comments from Samoa that reporting can sometimes be troublesome for CCMs, it was noted that the SPC-OFP will hold a workshop on Part 1 reporting next year.   6.3 Advice and recommendations of TCC3 to the Commission Seabird mitigation"
WCPFC4,185,"The results of the small working group meetings to finalize the text of minimum technical specifications for seabird mitigation measures under CMM-2006-02, were presented by the chair of the small working group, Mr Martinolich. Consensus was reached on suitable text and editing to remove all bracketed text remaining from deliberations held during TCC3.  The revised text was presented as WCPFC4-2007/22."
WCPFC4,186,"Australia, on behalf of FFA, spoke in support of adopting the new specifications, citing the need for collaborative monitoring and research between CCMs in order to assess the effectiveness of key measures and further develop them as required."
WCPFC4,187,"The USA noted that once the new specifications are adopted, some of the language of CMM-2006-02, such as that referring to the need to adopt such specifications and the guidelines the use of which was encouraged until adoption of such specifications, will need to be revised.  The USA offered to lead this re-drafting and the Commission accepted this offer. The revised CMM was considered under Agenda Item 8.1.    Sea turtle mitigation"
WCPFC4,188,"Development of a draft CMM for sea turtle mitigation progressed at TCC3 (TCC3 Summary Report, paras 113–121) and underwent further discussions in the margins of WCPFC4 via a small working group under the leadership of Ray Clarke (USA). Given that there are still several major issues to resolve, the Commission agreed to refer the matter to TCC4 but asked the working group to map out a process through which momentum can be maintained to bring a draft measure to WCPFC5."
WCPFC4,189,"Several CCMs, including Australia, China, the EC, Japan and the USA noted that circle hook trials were recently completed, underway or planned in their fisheries."
WCPFC4,190,"These CCMs and FFA members noted the importance of making progress not only with the draft CMM but also with planning for implementation, including understanding spatial and temporal interaction patterns, consulting and informing fishermen, and developing monitoring measures.    Juvenile bigeye and tellowfin tuna"
WCPFC4,191,"The Chair of the TCC referred to the discussion of mitigation measures for juvenile bigeye  and yellowfin tuna taken around fish aggregation devices (FADs) (TCC3 Summary Report, para 131–133). TCC3 recommended that an intersessional group work towards tabling a draft CMM at WCPFC4. An FFA member’s proposal for a draft CMM was discussed under Agenda Item 8.1.     27 High seas boarding and inspection"
WCPFC4,192,"TCC recommended a number of specifications related to high seas boarding and inspection procedures to the Commission for approval (TCC3 Summary Report, para 168–178). The acting Chair of the TCC thanked Canada and French Polynesia for providing a French version of the procedures. It was proposed that if Korea wished to develop a draft inspection checklist, the TCC could consider this matter at a subsequent meeting."
WCPFC4,193,"In response to a comment from Fiji, it was clarified that there is no intention to maintain a register of inspection officials, only of inspection vessels (TCC3 Summary Report, para 172)."
WCPFC4,194,"Chinese Taipei and Palau requested that a common format identity card be used by all inspection personnel. However, other CCMs believed this would be impractical and the acting Chair of TCC explained that this is why such a card was not proposed by TCC3."
WCPFC4,195,"The Commission agreed to endorse TCC3’s recommendation that the information in Attachment A to WCPFC-TCC3-2007/11 (Rev.1), including photos of individual inspection vessels, but excepting information regarding individual inspection officers and vessel contact details, should be posted for public access and circulated to CCMs."
WCPFC4,196,"Regarding samples of inspection personnel identity cards (TCC3 Summary Report, para 173), the Commission endorsed TCC3’s recommendation that future review of a universal format for CCM inspection identity cards may be desirable.    WCPFC IUU Vessel List"
WCPFC4,197,"Mr Sanford noted that the TCC prepared its first Provisional IUU Vessel List at TCC3. It considered six vessels and placed five of these on the Provisional List (TCC3 Summary Report, paras 190–198)."
WCPFC4,198,"Cook Islands provided additional background on the provisional listing of the Venezuelan purse seiner Athena F, noting that this vessel was again detected within the EEZ of Cook Islands without a license to fish from 14–15 November 2007. It noted that since the vessel had not yet been placed on the Commission’s IUU Vessel List, the sanctions contained in CMM-2006-09 do not yet apply. Cook Islands requested the assistance of the Commission in bringing this vessel and its owner before the courts, and in prohibiting the provision of port services to this vessel."
WCPFC4,199,The EC inquired as to whether there have been any communications from the Venezuelan Government regarding this matter. The Secretariat clarified that two letters have been sent to the Venezuelan Government but there has been no response.
WCPFC4,200,The Commission adopted the TCC’s recommendation to place the Athena F on the IUU Vessel List for unauthorized fishing by a vessel flagged to a non-CMM in the Convention Area.
WCPFC4,201,"Chinese Taipei provided an update on the status of the incident involving the Jinn Feng Tsair No.1, a longliner flagged to Chinese Taipei. This vessel was apprehended in FSM’s waters but fled to Chinese Taipei where it was sold. Chinese Taipei officials were not informed of the incident by FSM officials until after the vessel had been sold. Subsequently,  28 Chinese Taipei suspended the license of the vessel’s captain for one year. Although the current owner claims no knowledge of the incident, judicial proceedings to determine whether there was any link between the former and current owners were continuing. Chinese Taipei requested that the Jinn Feng Tsair No.1should not be included on the IUU Vessel List since the procedures in the Commission had not been followed by the other related State."
WCPFC4,202,"FSM acknowledged that discussions with Chinese Taipei regarding this incident were unresolved but were continuing. Given this, FSM maintained its request for WCPFC4 to place the vessel on the IUU Vessel List. If the matter is successfully resolved (i.e. if Chinese Taipei imposes sanctions of adequate severity or establishes that the previous owner no longer has any real interest, CMM-2006-09, para 20), the vessel may be removed from the list intersessionally."
WCPFC4,203,"Several CCMs supported FSM’s position, stating that the incident is a serious one, and that the burden of proof lies with the current vessel owner to demonstrate there is no link with the vessel at the time of the incident."
WCPFC4,204,"Japan noted that procedural issues relating to communication between the CCMs involved in this incident have contributed to difficulties in resolving it, and that a mechanism should be developed to avoid such issues in the future."
WCPFC4,205,"The Commission endorsed the TCC’s recommendation to list the Jinn Feng Tsair No.1 on the IUU Vessel List, noting that the vessel can be removed from the list intersessionally upon an exchange of letters between the involved CCMs and the Commission, stating that the issue has been resolved."
WCPFC4,206,FSM and Chinese Taipei agreed to resolve the matter of the Jinn Feng Tsair No.1 in this manner.
WCPFC4,207,"France provided further information relating to TCC3’s placing of the Vieirasa Cinco and the Robaleira on the Provisional IUU Vessel List for unauthorized swordfish operations on the high seas between French Polynesia and New Zealand. France clarified that it, rather than French Polynesia, nominated these two Senegalese longline vessels to TCC3 for inclusion on the Provisional List. One distinction between the two vessels concerns the timing of inspections. The Vieirasa Cinco was inspected in Papeete in November 2006 and on the basis of this inspection it was proposed for the Commission’s IUU Vessel List. France reported that the vessel was again sighted in the area in August–September 2007. The Robaleira was inspected at the end of March 2007."
WCPFC4,208,"One CCM questioned the basis for nominating the Vieirasa Cinco because:  a. the request to Senegal to remove its vessels from the Convention Area, subsequent to its unsuccessful application for CNM status at WCPFC3 in December 2006, was made in February 2007 (i.e. after the inspection);  b. CMM-2006-03, concerning swordfish, did not enter into force until 15 February 2007; and  c. CMM-2006-09 also did not enter into force until 15 February 2007."
WCPFC4,209,"Dr Tsamenyi cautioned that due process and careful consideration of evidence are required when making decisions about the IUU Vessel List. If the vessel in question was fishing illegally in an EEZ, then under international law, there is a clear violation of the coastal State’s laws and regulations. However, if the vessel was detected fishing on the high  29 seas, it can only be considered to be undertaking an IUU fishing activity if it is flagged to a State that is not discharging its flag State responsibility of cooperating with the Commission. Cooperation by a flag State with the Commission may be demonstrated by, inter alia: a. joining the Commission as a CCM (including cooperating as a CNM); or,  b. agreeing to mirror the CMMs of the Commission."
WCPFC4,210,"Dr Tsamenyi noted further that the key question in relation to the IUU listing of these vessels relates to whether they were authorized to fish. It is not sufficient to conclude that these vessels were not authorized to fish by CCMs of the Commission, since they may have been authorized to fish by Senegal according to its rights under the UNFSA. During the inspection, Senegalese high seas permits were not found onboard the vessel. However, these permits were produced and sent to the Commission after TCC3’s decision to place the vessels on the Provisional IUU Vessel List. It is not clear whether the vessels’ failure to carry the permits onboard while fishing is a violation of Senegalese law. The permits provided by Senegal appear to be valid fishing permits. In determining whether any specific violations of Commission CMMs occurred, the Commission could view its decision to refuse CNM status to Senegal at WCPFC3 in December 2006 as a reflection of its non-cooperation, specifically since inadequate data on fishing activities had been provided. The Commission may then determine that the flag State is not cooperating with the Commission and on this basis, ask the flag State to withdraw its vessels from the Convention Area."
WCPFC4,211,"Vanuatu offered additional information on the conduct of these two vessels in Vanuatu’s waters. Beginning in April 2006, one-year fishing licenses were granted by Vanuatu to these two vessels. When these licenses expired, they were not renewed but Vanuatu is satisfied that both vessels complied with its requirements."
WCPFC4,212,Cook Islands noted that it had exercised port State measures against the two vessels (based on the decisions at TCC3) by refusing port services to both vessels in September 2007.
WCPFC4,213,"Dr Tsamenyi said that in the case of the Vieirasa Cinco, the alleged violation occurred prior to the implementation of the CMMs, which are not to be applied retroactively, and prior to the request to Senegal to withdraw its vessels from the Convention Area. In the case of the Robaleira, the violation occurred after Senegal had been requested to withdraw its vessels from the Convention Area and after the CMM on swordfish and IUU had come into force. Although the Robaleira is not authorized to fish by the Commission’s CCMs, valid fishing permits have been provided by Senegal."
WCPFC4,214,The Commission agreed not to place the Vieirasa Cinco and the Robaleira on the IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC4,215,"France reviewed the information pertinent to the case of the Daniela F, a Venezuelan flagged purse seiner found to be engaging in unlicensed fishing for tuna in France’s EEZ in April 2007. Subsequent to the inspection, the vessel’s captain admitted the offence, and France imposed appropriate penalties on the vessel under French law."
WCPFC4,216,Several CCMs questioned whether the vessel should be listed given that the violation occurred within France’s EEZ and France had already imposed penalties on the vessel.
WCPFC4,217,"Other CCMs noted that if the full range of offending behaviors has not been punished, then listing the vessel by the Commission on its IUU Vessel List may still be warranted.   30"
WCPFC4,218,"Dr Tsamenyi advised that one of the important considerations under CMM-2006-09 is whether the flag State has taken effective action in response to the alleged violation, such as removing the vessel from its registry or taking other actions to ensure that further IUU fishing by the vessel does not occur."
WCPFC4,219,"The Commission adopted the TCC’s recommendation to place the Daniela F on the IUU Vessel List for unauthorized fishing in France’s EEZ. It was agreed, however, that an appropriate response by Venezuela concerning the exercise of its flag State responsibilities may provide grounds for intersessional deletion of the vessel from the list."
WCPFC4,220,"Mr Sanford noted that TCC3 recommended that work on revisions to CMM-2006-09 continue intersessionally, with a view to presenting a draft proposal to WCPFC4. Submissions on this topic were received from the USA (WCPFC4-2007/DP15), Korea (WCPFC4-2007/DP16) and Chinese Taipei (WCPFC4-2007/DP19) and are presented under Agenda Item 8.1.    Data issues"
WCPFC4,221,"TCC3 made several recommendations to the Commission in relation to data access, dissemination and security (TCC3 Report, paras 214–217). Discussion of these issues was deferred to Agenda Item 7.   Consideration by TCC of applications for CNM status"
WCPFC4,222,"TCC3 recommended to the Commission that it require CNM submissions to be received 30 days in advance of the annual TCC meeting, so as to allow TCC to review applications and provide technical advice (TCC3 Summary Report, para 229)."
WCPFC4,223,"The EC noted that TCC’s workload was already too great and, thus, it should not be further burdened with reviewing CNM applications. It was suggested that an ad hoc working group of the Commission would be better suited to the task."
WCPFC4,224,"Some CCMs, including the USA, Australia and New Zealand, disagreed, noting the existence of relevant expertise of the TCC in these issues and the fact that forming an ad hoc working group would not necessarily relieve resource constraints."
WCPFC4,225,"The Chair agreed to postpone a decision on this item until after the CNM application discussions were concluded, and if not resolved by WCPFC4, to defer this issue to TCC4 and WCPFC5.    Dates for TCC4"
WCPFC4,226,"The EC stated that the agreed upon dates for the next TCC meeting (TCC3 Summary Report, para 242) would conflict with the meeting of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) and recommended a slight postponement of the dates."
WCPFC4,227,"Japan and New Zealand, however, indicated existing commitments conflict with the EC’s proposed dates."
WCPFC4,228,"The Chair noted the need to resolve such conflicts, to find a suitable timeframe for the TCC, and to hold the meeting in that period each year.    31 6.4 TCC 2008 work programme"
WCPFC4,229,"It was noted that the TCC had approved the four primary elements of the technical and compliance programme budget for 2008 as being the VMS, including funding to support the VMS Working Group; funding for regional liaison by the Observer Programme Coordinator; Boarding and Inspection implementation; and implementation of website design work on the bycatch mitigation component. Costing proposals for the VMS were discussed in a small working group chaired by Glenn Joseph of RMI. The latter three items were discussed in the FAC."
WCPFC4,230,"New Zealand commented that the process employed by TCC3 to develop the programme of work was considerably more informal than that by the SC.  In their view technical priorities should be agreed before the budgets are discussed in the FAC.    AGENDA  ITEM  7  -  RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE PROTECTION, ACCESS TO, AND DISSEMINATION OF DATA COMPILED BY THE COMMISSION"
WCPFC4,231,"Ms Holly Koehler (USA), who chaired a small working group on data at TCC3, presented recent progress on the refinement of existing rules and procedures for access to, and dissemination of, data compiled by the Commission (WCPFC4-2007/12). The underlined text in this document represents the outcome of discussions held at SC3 and TCC3 on revisions to the rules and procedures that were adopted at WCPFC3 as a “living document”. The revised rules and procedures contained as Attachment C in this paper were recommended for WCPFC4 endorsement by TCC3."
WCPFC4,232,"The Commission adopted the rules and procedures as contained in WCPFC4-2007/12, Attachment C."
WCPFC4,233,"Ms Koehler then introduced a draft framework for access to different types of non-public domain data, a draft data request form and a draft confidentiality agreement (WCPFC4-2007/12 Suppl.). Progress on these supplemental documents was initially impeded by lack of agreement on the rules and procedures document (described above in para 231), but was progressed during and subsequent to TCC3. Since TCC3, comments were received from Japan and Korea (WCPFC4-2007/12) and incorporated by the Secretariat in the form of underlined text in WCPFC4-2007/12 Suppl., Attachment A."
WCPFC4,234,"The Commission adopted the documents following a minor refinement proposed by the USA that the Framework, Data Request Form and Confidentiality Agreement be incorporated in the newly adopted “Rules and Procedures for the Protection of, Access to, and Dissemination of, Data Compiled by the Commission”."
WCPFC4,235,"Mr Keith Bigelow (USA), Vice-Chair of the SC, presented a residual issue regarding the provision of catch and effort data east of the eastern boundary of the Convention Area (as contained in SC3 Report, Attachment K, Appendix 4, part 4). As described in WCPFC4-2007/21, a small group recommended that the brackets be removed from the text as it stands and this was endorsed by the Commission. The SC’s Vice-Chair noted that discussion of this issue could continue through consultation with IATTC including the WCPFC-IATTC consultation held during WCPFC4.     32"
WCPFC4,236,"The USA presented TCC3’s recommendation to the Commission that the Ad Hoc Task Group–Data be resumed to develop the separate rules and procedures for the protection of, access to and dissemination of non-public domain data for the purpose of compliance and enforcement activities on the high seas, as well as to consider the other data security and exchange issues noted by the VMS working group (TCC3 Summary Report, para 215). New Zealand supported the TCC’s recommendation."
WCPFC4,237,"The Chair, noting previously expressed concerns by CCMs regarding the workload of the TCC and its working groups, recommended that work on this issue be progressed electronically.  The Commission endorsed TCC’s recommendation for continuation of the work, through electronic communication, of the Ad Hoc Task Group–Data.    AGENDA  ITEM  8  -  CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES  8.1 Conservation and management measures  Review of existing measures  Resolution on the Reduction of Overcapacity (Resolution-2005-02)"
WCPFC4,238,"This resolution calls upon CCMs — whose nationals are beneficial owners of purse seiners that entered the WCPFC Convention Area after the MHLC and PrepCon resolutions and other concerned CCMs — to work together to ensure that the beneficial owners reduce, by 31 December 2007, such overcapacity as created by those fishing vessels through the reduction of equivalent fishing capacity of other fishing vessels operating in the Convention Area. Given the impending deadline for the resolution, CCMs were invited to comment on their progress."
WCPFC4,239,"Chinese Taipei reported that, in order to support its commitment to WCPFC to maintain purse seiners at levels not exceeding 34 vessels, it has abolished the licenses of 8 vessels. In addition, it has scrapped 35 large-scale tuna longliners with ultra low-temperature freezers operating in the Convention Area during 2005–2007, resulting in a 41% reduction from the original number of 86. With these two actions, Chinese Taipei feels it has fully implemented the resolution. Japan and China expressed appreciation for Chinese Taipei’s efforts in reducing overcapacity. There were no objections from other members."
WCPFC4,240,"The Philippines reported that of the original number of purse-seine vessels of 3,500–5,000, only 1,200 vessels remained in 2006. A moratorium on new vessels has been in place since October 2003.    Specifications for the Marking and Identification of Fishing Vessels (CMM-2004-03)"
WCPFC4,241,This measure provides the specifications for marking fishing vessels. It was noted that the clarity of photos submitted as part of the Record of Fishing Vessels are often unclear and need to be improved in order to illustrate markings.         33 Resolution to Mitigate the Impact of Fishing for Highly Migratory Fish Species on Sea Turtles (Resolution-2005-04)
WCPFC4,242,This resolution encourages CCMs to implement the FAO Guidelines to Reduce Sea Turtle Mortality in Fishing Operations and to compile data and conduct research on this subject. This work will be progressed by an intersessional working group led by the USA. The working group will communicate electronically.  Record of Fishing Vessels and Authorization to Fish (CMM-2004-01)
WCPFC4,243,"Proposals from RMI and Australia to revise this CMM were considered under Agenda Item 8.1, New Conservation and Management Measures.  Cooperating Non-members (CMM-2004-02)"
WCPFC4,244,"WCPFC4 received new applications from Belize, Ecuador, El Salvador and Senegal for CNM status and an application from Indonesia to renew its CNM status.  These decisions in relation to these applications are presented under Agenda Item 2.    Conservation and Management Measures for Bigeye and Yellowfin Tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (CMM-2005-01 and CMM-2006-01)"
WCPFC4,245,"These CMMs provide for registration of existing regional or bilateral fisheries partnership agreements or arrangements; effort limits for purse-seine fisheries between 20oN and 20oS; bigeye tuna catch limits for the longline fishery; capacity limits for other fisheries excluding artisanal fisheries; conditions for exemptions for certain developing skipjack purse-seine fisheries; and the development and submission to the Commission of FAD management plans and catch retention plans (CRPs) for purse-seine vessels. With regards to FAD management plans and CRPs, TCC3 has made various recommendations for concerted action by CCMs, liaison with other RFMOs on experience and research, and the importance of the Regional Observer Programme in supporting these plans."
WCPFC4,246,"The Secretariat noted that although CMM-2005-01 required information to be submitted by the time of WCPFC3 in December 2006, several CCMs had submitted the required information at different times during 2007. At the time of WCPFC4, 13 bilateral agreements, including a recent submission by Korea regarding a bilateral agreement with Tuvalu, had been received. These are summarized in WCPFC4-2007/13 (Table 4)."
WCPFC4,247,"FFA members noted that access agreements are only required to be registered with the Commission under the footnote to CMM 2005-01 if a CCM wants them taken into account for the purpose of establishing limits under CMM 2005-01. FFA members requested that the reference to the footnote be clarified in future reports of this kind, if necessary by quoting the complete text of the footnote instead of part of it."
WCPFC4,248,"PNG emphasized the need for more to be done to stop overfishing of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna, in particular, closing areas of high seas “pockets” that are being exploited by IUU operations."
WCPFC4,249,"New Zealand raised concerns that tables in Attachment A of WPCFC4-2007/13 were being presented in a way that suggested certain CCMs were in breach of their obligations under WCPFC 2006-01 when the data included in those tables were for periods before that  34 measure was adopted by the Commission, and that the table made interpretations with regards to measurement of fishing effort that went beyond those in the measure itself. The Secretariat explained that the purpose was simply to provide an indication of how recorded levels of fishing effort compared with those provided for in the measures."
WCPFC4,250,"The EC noted that Attachment A of WPCFC4-2007/13 shows zero catch for the EC, although there are EC vessels operating in the Convention Area."
WCPFC4,251,The Secretariat noted that a skipjack fishery development plan has been received from Australia (WCPFC4-2007/DP06). One Member expressed concern in light of excessive fishing capacity over resources as well as developing perspectives of SIDS.
WCPFC4,252,"PNG stated its opinion that it was inappropriate for the Secretariat to require CCMs to submit skipjack fishery development plans for within their own EEZs, as developing such fisheries is a sovereign right of CCMs."
WCPFC4,253,"The Chair reminded CCMs that the deadline for submitting FAD management plans to the Secretariat is 1 January 2008, and that thus far PNG is the only CCM to have submitted a FAD management plan. Other CCMs were urged to submit their plans before the deadline to avoid contravening the CMM. Australia submitted a FAD management plan to the Secretariat during WCPFC 4."
WCPFC4,254,"The deadline for CRPs was September’s TCC3 meeting. Australia, New Zealand and Vanuatu are the only CCMs to have submitted CRPs to the Secretariat.    Conservation and Management Measure for South Pacific Albacore (CMM-2005-02)"
WCPFC4,255,"This measure provides that CCMs shall not increase the number of their fishing vessels actively fishing for South Pacific albacore in the Convention Area south of 20ºS above 2005 levels or historical (2000–2004) levels. The Executive Director noted that there is currently no means to measure active fishing above the 2005 level or the recent historical 2000–2004 levels because the level of effort south of 20oS is not reported on by fleets active in that area. Therefore, the Secretariat requested CCMs to provide a clear delineation of their catches in this area."
WCPFC4,256,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members, noted the concerns raised at the SC3 about potential loopholes that could limit the effectiveness of the South Pacific albacore CMM. They requested the Commission to require CCMs to submit data on their catch of albacore, and the number of vessels fishing for albacore, south of 20ºS. The Commission agreed that CCMs must submit this information.   Conservation and Management Measures for North Pacific Albacore (CMM-2005-03)"
WCPFC4,257,"This measure requires CCMs to report catches of North Pacific albacore. The first report was due on 30 April 2006 for the calendar year 2004. Catch reports have been received for 10 CCM fleets. The Secretariat noted that the SC, TCC and NC all suggest that data gaps are a problem. Seven CCMs have reported data covering 10 gear types, but most cover annual catches and there is very little six-month reporting as is required under the measure. The Chair reminded parties to ensure compliance with the reporting requirements.    35  Conservation and Management Measures to Mitigate the Impact of Fishing for Highly Migratory Fish Stocks on Seabirds(CMM-2006-02)"
WCPFC4,258,"Under this measure, CCMs fishing in the area south of 30oS and north of 23oN shall submit specifications of seabird mitigation measures by 30 November 2007. Only the USA and Australia have submitted this information.    Conservation and Management Measure for Swordfish in the Southwest Pacific (CMM-2006-03)"
WCPFC4,259,"CCMs were required to report, by 1 May 2007, the number of vessels that had fished for swordfish in the Convention Area south of 20oS during the period 2000–2005, and thus to nominate the maximum number of vessels that may continue to be permitted to fish for swordfish in this area.  Six CCMs have provided this information to the Commission and two other CCMs, Vanuatu and the USA, have provided other related information."
WCPFC4,260,"Samoa stated that it has not nominated an applicable limit for its vessels fishing for swordfish because, in accordance with paragraph 2 of CMM-2006-03, as a SIDS, it considers Samoa to be exempt from such a limit. It was suggested that this point should be clarified for future reference."
WCPFC4,261,"Some CCMs expressed concerns about the impact on swordfish data arising from the various landing practices by EC vessels. The EC clarified that regardless of landing location, all relevant data were reported to SPC, which is the Commission’s data manager.    Conservation and Management Measure for Striped Marlin in the Southwest Pacific (CMM-2006-04)"
WCPFC4,262,"CCMs were required to report, by 1 July 2007, the number of vessels that have fished for striped marlin in the Convention Area south of 15oS during the period 2000–2004, and thus to nominate the maximum numbers of vessels that may continue to be permitted to fish for striped marlin in this area. Four CCMs have provided this information to the Commission and two other CCMs, Vanuatu and the USA, have provided other related information."
WCPFC4,263,The USA clarified that the fleets listed in their submissions under CMM-2006-03 and CMM-2006-03 were catching these species in small numbers as bycatch.
WCPFC4,264,Japan explained that it did not submit the information pursuant to CMM-2006-03 and CMM-2006-04 because any swordfish or striped marlin caught by Japanese fishing vessels in these areas is bycatch.
WCPFC4,265,"French Polynesia also said their swordfish and striped marlin catch is bycatch but they offered to submit the data to the Commission’s data manager, SPC-OFP, for their records."
WCPFC4,266,FFA members noted that the comment by Samoa in relation to swordfish (see para 255 above) also applied with respect to striped marlin.      36 Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (CMM-2006-05)
WCPFC4,267,"This measure calls for voluntary implementation of the FAO’s International Plan of Action–Sharks, and initiated work by the SC to identify key shark species and review the fin-to-body weight ratio that vessels fishing in the Convention Area are allowed to retain. The measure will be implemented by 1 January 2008 for vessels greater than 24 m in overall length."
WCPFC4,268,The USA drew CCMs’ attention to recent developments at the UN General Assembly regarding shark conservation and management. The Commission noted that States and RFMOs will increasingly be called upon to adopt measures to manage both directed and non-directed shark fisheries.    Other conservation and management measures
WCPFC4,269,"CMMs pertaining to the Vessel Monitoring System (CMM-2006-06), the Regional Observer Programme (CMM-2006-07), Boarding and Inspection Procedures (CMM-2006-08) and the IUU Vessel List (CMM-2006-09) underwent further development at WCPFC4 and are reported on in the following section."
WCPFC4,270,"Dr Tsamenyi advised that the failure by CCMs to implement CMMs adopted by the Commission may result in their vessels being considered as undertaking IUU fishing activities under the international plan of action (IPOA)-IUU. A vessel flagged to a CCM may be considered to be fishing illegally if it is fishing in contravention of the CMMs adopted by the Commission. A vessel flagged to a CCM may be considered to be engaged in unreported fishing if it does not report, or if it mis-reports its catches in contravention of the Commission’s CMMs. A vessel flagged to a CCM may be considered to be undertaking unregulated fishing if the Commission fails to develop appropriate CMMs.    Consideration of new measures and other conservation requirements New CMM for the reduction of mortality of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna"
WCPFC4,271,"Discussions on developing a new CMM for reduction of fishing mortality for juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna were initiated based on a proposal tabled by FFA members (WCPFC4-2007/DP12). The proposal contained three major elements: full catch retention requirement in purse-seine fisheries, a three-month fixed period purse-seine FAD closure, and a 25% reduction in fishing mortality for bigeye tuna catches in longline fisheries based on recommendations of the SC."
WCPFC4,272,"Many FFA-member CCMs, along with Greenpeace, voiced their support for the proposal."
WCPFC4,273,Tuvalu expressed concerns about the impacts of a FAD closure on its economy.
WCPFC4,274,Palau noted that mandatory reductions in fishing mortality based on historical catches in the longline fishery would pose serious problems because it estimates that its catches were actually double those reported due to illegal transhipment activities.     37
WCPFC4,275,"Some CCMs, including Australia and the EC, believed that the FFA proposal did not go far enough toward conserving bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks, and suggested that further and stricter measures would be required in addition to the proposal."
WCPFC4,276,"Other CCMs, including China, Japan and Chinese Taipei, were of the view that exemptions requested by various coastal States would result in a FAD closure only on the high seas area and a catch reduction of 25% for bigeye tuna in the longline fishery did not seem to fairly balance the interests of different CCMs.  Those CCMs felt that the impact of the implementation of CMM-2005-01 was not yet known and that scientific information currently available, was not enough to warrant action at this time. These CCMs suggested deferring the issue to WCPFC5 when the results of a new stock assessment for bigeye tuna will be available and further results of the IPDCP will have been reported."
WCPFC4,277,"Mr Paul Dalzell (USA) and Mr Augustine Mobiha (PNG) co-chaired a working group aimed at reaching consensus on a draft CMM to supplement CMM-2005-01 and CMM-2006-01 on bigeye and yellowfin tuna in the WCPO. After several rounds of discussion, the chairs produced WPCFC4-2007/27 (Rev.4) as a co-chair’s summary of the output of the working group. The working group could not reach agreement on the terms of FAD closures, specifically whether the closure should be one or three months and at a fixed or flexible time. There were also a number of exemptions proposed, including Philippine purse seiners operating on the high seas and small domestic vessels (< 50 m) in FFA member countries. In terms of bigeye tuna catch reductions in longline fisheries, a number of options for exempting fisheries with relatively smaller catches were discussed. The Chair noted that considerable additional work will be required during the coming year to support efforts at WCPFC5 to adopt a suitable CMM for reducing bigeye and yellowfin tuna catches."
WCPFC4,278,"Japan presented the results of two research projects related to the reduction of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna mortality in purse-seine fisheries (WCPCF4-2007/DP17 [rev. 2]). Although the research showed no significant relationship between bigeye catches and the depth of the underwater structure of FADs, using large sized mesh (> 300 mm) in part of the body of nets in the tropical WCPO was suggested as a means of reducing mortality of juvenile bigeye tuna. Japan also noted that since its purse seiners spend a greater amount of time in transit to fishing grounds, its effort is effectively only 60–70% that of other fleets."
WCPFC4,279,"Dr Hampton prepared a paper to assist the working group in evaluating management options. In SPC-OFP’s view, a one-month FAD closure would lead to little, if any, reduction in fishing mortality of juvenile yellowfin and bigeye tuna because vessels would probably be able to coincide such a closure with routine downtime related to unloading and/or vessel maintenance."
WCPFC4,280,"Some CCMs noted that information in the form provided by Dr Hampton was very useful to the Commission and requested that the information be passed to the SC for review, and that the SC should provide similar analysis on relevant management options next year."
WCPFC4,281,"Supported by China and Australia, French Polynesia suggested a compromise position of a two-month FAD closure. Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei supported a one-month FAD closure.  Most FFA-member CCMs and the EC supported a three-month FAD closure."
WCPFC4,282,The USA stated that any measures proposed must be enforceable under current MCS measures. It cited the example of IATTC catch retention measures that show less than 40% compliance even under conditions of 100% observer coverage.    38
WCPFC4,283,"  Recognizing the failure of WCPFC4 to adopt a measure to address concerns relating to overfishing of bigeye and yellowfin tuna, particularly in relation to purse-seine fishing on FADs as agreed on at WCPFC3 in December 2006, the Commission agreed that, at its meeting in December 2008, it would adopt a supplementary and/or revised CMM for bigeye and yellowfin tuna."
WCPFC4,284, The CMM will be based upon the most recent scientific advice. The Chair stated that future or pending scientific studies will not be used as an excuse to delay the adoption of the measure. The CMM must have the potential to deliver tangible results in terms of an improvement in the status of the WCPO stocks of bigeye and yellowfin.
WCPFC4,285,"The CMM will apply to purse seining, longlining and other commercial fisheries that catch yellowfin and bigeye tuna in the Convention Area."
WCPFC4,286,The Commission tasked the Fourth Regular Sessions of the SC and TCC to provide advice and recommendations that will support the development of the CMM.
WCPFC4,287,"  The advice and recommendations will, inter alia, include consideration of the status of stocks, the potential for technological solutions to maximize the selectivity of fishing gear for juvenile yellowfin and bigeye tuna while minimizing the impact on the skipjack fishery, fairness and equity and enforceability including the status of the implementation of MCS measures in the Commission, particularly the ROP and VMS."
WCPFC4,288,"The Commission committed to the implementation of the ROP and VMS during 2008 as critical elements that are required to support the implementation of the new measure. In preparation for the implementation of this measure in 2009, CCMs will implement these measures in their purse seine and longline fleets during 2008."
WCPFC4,289,"The development of the draft CMM will include consultation with industry, particularly the WTPO, and will identify research currently being conducted that will improve our understanding of how to deal with this conservation challenge."
WCPFC4,290,"The Commission called on CCMs to take voluntary steps to mitigate the impact of their fishing activities on the sustainability of bigeye and yellowfin tuna and to report back on steps taken, as part of their Part 2 Annual Reports  CMM for the  implementation of the Regional Observer Programme"
WCPFC4,291,"A small working group, convened by Dr Karnella during WCPFC4, produced WCPFC4-2007/23 (Rev.2), which proposes a framework for implementing the ROP. Implementation is based on the use of existing regional, sub-regional and national programmes already operational in the region when the CMM enters into force on 15 February 2008, and provides for gradual development of the programme through 2012. The minimum size of vessels requiring an observer, as well as other operational aspects of the ROP, was deferred for consideration under the intersessional working group (IWG)-ROP and its recommendation to the Commission on this matter in 2008."
WCPFC4,292,"This outcome, along with a slightly amended version of the measure forwarded from TCC3, was adopted by the Commission as a new CMM for the ROP, CMM-2007-01 (Attachment K).   39  Amendments to the CMM for the Commission Vessel Monitoring System  (CMM-2006-06)"
WCPFC4,293,"Pursuant to a concern raised at TCC3 (TCC3 Summary Report, para 50), the USA proposed an amendment to CMM-2006-06, requiring that vessels in the Convention Area be required to maintain VMS transmission when they move into the part of the Convention Area bounded by 20oN and 175oE (the area for which a VMS implementation date has yet to be established) from elsewhere in the Convention Area (WCPFC4-2007/DP31). Japan expressed support for the USA’s amendment. The revised measure is appended as Attachment L."
WCPFC4,294,The Commission adopted the amendment as contained in WCPFC4-2007/DP31. It was accepted that CMM-2006-06 would be revised to reflect this amendment. The Commission noted that the NC is responsible for developing proposals for VMS implementation in the area north of 20oN and west of 175oE.    New CMM for a catch documentation scheme
WCPFC4,295,"A small working group, convened by Mr Wez Norris (Australia) during WCPFC4, developed terms of reference for an intersessional working group to examine the idea of a CDS for fisheries in the Convention Area.  Divergent opinions were expressed by CCMs participating in the small working group. These opinions ranged from strong support to doubts about the practicality of a CDS and about CCM capabilities to cope with the increased workload a CDS would impose. The Commission was not able to adopt terms of reference for this work during WCPFC4."
WCPFC4,296,"The EC, noting its experience with CDS issues in this and other RFMO forums (e.g. see WCPFC4-2007/DP24), volunteered to lead an intersessional working group (operating electronically) to work toward designing an appropriate CDS for the region that focuses on the most critical species. This intersessional working group will operate independently from the TCC in order to reduce the TCC’s workload. The report of the working group will be tabled at TCC4 for review, possible refinement, and adopting for forwarding to WCPFC5.    New CMM(s) for Record of Fishing Vessels and Authorization to Fish"
WCPFC4,297,"Following TCC3’s recommendations regarding 1) whether or not (and how) to allow the operation of non-CCM flagged carrier and bunker vessels on the high seas in the Convention Area (TCC3 Summary Report, paras 151–153), and 2) tracking the active/inactive status of vessels on the Record of Fishing Vessels (TCC3 Summary Report, para 138), a small working group was convened at WCPFC4 under the leadership of Mr Norris. This small working group considered a proposal on the second issue by Australia (WCPFC4-2007/DP04) and a proposal on the first issue by RMI (WCPFC4-2007/DP09). The report of the small group is appended as Attachment M."
WCPFC4,298,RMI explained that many of the bunker and carrier vessels in its waters are flagged to non-CCMs. This was the basis for their proposal to amend CMM 2004-01 so as to allow the operation of such vessels and to do so through establishment of a separate registry for bunkers and carriers flagged to non-CCMs. This would in effect make the temporary register of carrier and bunker vessels a permanent register.     40
WCPFC4,299,"Australia’s proposal would call for a list of each CCM’s active fishing vessels to be submitted each July, based on the previous year’s data. Its proposal would also provide for information to be submitted on the number of days fished by each vessel, with the purpose of facilitating the evaluation of CMMs."
WCPFC4,300,"The Commission adopted the following recommendations of the small working group: a. The Commission should defer consideration of establishing a record of non-CCM carrier and bunker vessels. b. The Commission should refer the original proposal from RMI, as amended in paragraphs 1(c), 1(d), 11–16, and 19–22 of WCPFC4-2007/28 should be referred to TCC4 for consideration. c. The Commission should encourage interested CCMs to work together before TCC4 to continue to develop this measure for adoption in 2008. d. The Commission should extend the current exemption for non-CCM carrier and bunker vessels for 2008 pending the work recommended above. e. Before 1 July of each year, each Commission Member shall submit to the Executive Director a list of all vessels that appeared in its record of fishing vessels at any time during the preceding calendar year, together with each vessel’s registration number, the WCPFC identification number (WIN), and an indication of whether each vessel fished for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area beyond its area of national jurisdiction. The indication shall be expressed as (a) fished, or (b) did not fish. f. Members that operate joint-venture or charter arrangements that result in data reporting obligations being conferred to a party other than the flag State will make arrangements to ensure that the flag State can meet its obligations under para 300(e). g. The WCPFC Record of Active Fishing Vessels shall identify those fishing vessels so listed that were active in the Convention Area in the preceding year, consistent with the information provided by Members under para 300(e).  h. The Executive Director shall use available information, including the information supplied by Members under para 300(e) to assist in the assessment of the implementation of relevant CMMs and resolutions for the annual consideration of the TCC."
WCPFC4,301,The Commission noted that some CCMs will not be able to provide full information in 2008.
WCPFC4,302,The Commission noted a suggestion to establish a real-time active vessel list at some stage in the future as part of an integrated MCS package.    New CMM for transhipment
WCPFC4,303,"Following discussions under Agenda Item 6.1, proposals submitted by RMI, Australia and  Japan were considered as the basis for a consolidated proposal by a small working group during WCPFC4."
WCPFC4,304,"After several meetings, the small working group on transhipment agreed that further progress on a measure at WCPFC4 would not be possible. The group recommended that an intersessional working group that meets electronically, be established. The intersessional  41 working group may consider the following issues, noting the requirements under Convention Article 29:  a. identifying characteristics of fisheries engaged in transhipment in the WCPFC Convention Area as called for in Article 29(4); b. identifying areas of application to which procedures allowing and regulating transhipment under Article 29(3) would apply, taking into account the characteristics identified above; c. developing procedures to obtain and verify data on the quantity and species transhipped, both in port and at sea in the Convention Area (including reviewing the current Annual Report template if necessary); d. developing further procedures to determine when transhipment covered by this Convention has been completed; and e. developing guidelines to be applied if CCMs choose to designate ports for  transhipment.    Revision of CMM on IUU Vessel List (CMM-2006-09)"
WCPFC4,305,"Papers relating to the amendment of the current CMM on establishing an IUU Vessel List were submitted by the USA (WCPFC4-2007/DP15), Korea (WCPFC4-2007/DP16) and Chinese Taipei (WCPFC-2007/DP19). The USA proposal, which contains draft text for a revised CMM, was tabled at TCC3 where it was agreed that discussions should continue through an intersessional working group and the USA would bring a revised proposal to WCPFC4."
WCPFC4,306,"Korea’s proposal sought to remove a provision contained in CMM-2006-09, which calls for the description of IUU activities to include vessels that “are under the control of the owner of any vessel on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List”. Korea pointed out that para 3j is not a relevant example of IUU fishing activities as defined in the FAO’s International Plan of Action on IUU fishing, and that other RFMOs other than IATTC and South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (SEAFO) have not adopted such a provision. Korea also stated that the level of sanction on the owner of the vessel on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List should be decided by flag States themselves, not the Commission."
WCPFC4,307,"Dr Tsamenyi clarified that this provision is not contained in the IPOA-IUU, which focuses on vessel activity rather than on the owner of the vessel. Dr Tsamenyi also noted that the inclusion of the provision is a policy issue for Members, which has to be considered in terms of domestic legal and constitutional requirements rather than international law. Korea asked if it would be more precise to use the word “defined” as opposed to “described”, as proposed by the USA, in reference to the use of the phrase “as described in the IPOA on IUU fishing”. Dr Tsamenyi explained that since FAO’s IPOA on IUU does not define IUU fishing, but simply “refers” to a list of activities that may constitute IUU fishing, it is more appropriate to use the term “described”, as is the case with CMM-2006-09."
WCPFC4,308,"Chinese Taipei proposed three points for consideration in the new CMM: a. Reversion to the term “evidence”, rather than “suitably documented information”; b. Provision for IUU fishing incidents that have been settled to the satisfaction of the involved CCMs to be excluded from the draft list; c. Provision for a requirement that inclusion in the IUU Vessel List cannot occur without there having been notification to the flag State prior to its submission to the Secretariat for inclusion on the draft list.    42"
WCPFC4,309,"In discussion, the EC raised comments concerning the role of the Commission’s Executive Director in the listing process; provisions for port State measures; procedures to be followed if the flag State is not notified of the incident; and mutual recognition of IUU lists of other RFMOs."
WCPFC4,310,"A small working group, convened under the leadership of Ms Koehler produced a further revision to CMM-2006-09 WCPFC4-2007/DP15 (Rev.2).  This document embodies some points of agreement reached during WCPFC4 but does not represent consensus on other points, inter alia, the provision to extend the list to other vessels of the same owner (paragraph 3j) amendments to paragraph 22 regarding measures to be taken by CCMs and mutual recognition of IUU lists of other RFMOs."
WCPFC4,311,"The Commission agreed to adopt WCPFC4-2007/DP15 (Rev.2) as a revised measure, CMM-2007-03, which will replace the current text of CMM 2006-09 in its entirety (Attachment N).  The Commission also agreed to defer discussion on other proposed amendments on which consensus had not been reached, including the amendment proposed by Korea in relation to paragraph 3j and the proposal by the EC for mutual recognition of IUU lists of other RFMOs, to the next meeting."
WCPFC4,312,"In relation to issues raised in respect of paragraph 3j, the Commission agreed to task Dr Tsamenyi with preparing a paper on the issues of beneficial ownership and IUU for consideration by WCPFC5. Korea, Japan, and the USA indicated that they wished to revisit next year (at TCC4) some of the issues that could not be resolved."
WCPFC4,313,"New Zealand stated its intention to work with FFA members to draft a CMM — for the control of nationals — for TCC4’s consideration, and welcomed contributions from other interested CCMs in this regard.     Revision of CMM on Mitigating the Impact of Fishing on Seabirds (CMM-2007-03)"
WCPFC4,314,The USA led a small drafting group to amend CMM-2006-02 to reflect the new minimum technical specifications produced by a small working group (WCPFC4-2007/24). The amended CMM was tabled as WCPFC4-2007/24 (Rev.2).
WCPFC4,315,"In response to a question from the EC regarding the scientific rigor of the specifications, the USA explained that the specifications were developed with input from BirdLife International, and that the CMM will be reviewed annually, and that further work on fishery–seabird interactions is proposed under the SC’s 2008 work programme."
WCPFC4,316,"In response to a question from the Chair, ACAP expressed support for the measure, on the basis that CCMs worked together to further test some aspects."
WCPFC4,317,The Commission adopted the revised CMM for mitigating the impact of fishing on seabirds as CMM-2007-03 (Attachment O).    New CMM on the aspirations of small island developing States
WCPFC4,318,"RMI introduced WCPFC4-2007-DP07, which calls on the Commission to develop and implement measures supporting fishery development in SIDS, while recognizing the principles contained in Resolution 2005-02. In addition, developed CCMs were requested to  43 reduce or restructure their fleets to accommodate the aspirations of SIDS. RMI advised that while it was receptive to suggestions to refine its proposal, it was past the time for the Commission to honor the rhetoric of supporting fisheries development in SIDS CCMs, support the provisions of the CMMs that have been adopted without prejudice to the legitimate rights and obligations of coastal States in relation to the development of their fisheries, and develop a clear strategy to support SIDS in their individual and collective development aspirations. RMI recalled the Vava’u Declaration on Pacific Fisheries Resources agreed at the recent meeting of Pacific Islands Forum Leaders in Tonga, which while recognizing the need for Pacific Islands to become more proactive in promoting sustainable development of Pacific tuna fisheries, also committed Forum Island countries to further strengthening the WCPFC’s CMMs. RMI further stated their disappointment in that the Commission is considering new applicants, which will ultimately add capacity into the region, and that this is supported by Members who have not supported the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu in their pursuit of fishery development. RMI raised further concerns of fairness and priority, as it felt left behind on its issue of fishery development (SIDS aspirations), as a founding Member of the Commission, while the Commission deliberates upon and contemplates accommodating applications of new entrants. RMI, in submitting its draft resolution, sought clarification of the Commission’s interpretation of the intent of Resolution 2005-02 (para 2), CMM-2005-01 (para 6) and CMM-2005-01 (paras 7–10) with regards to the development aspirations of SIDS as partially reflected in the Summary Record of WCPFC3 at para 88."
WCPFC4,319,"In relation to Resolution-2005-02, para 2:  Paragraph 1 above shall be implemented to ensure that no adverse effect is given to the coastal processing and transhipment facilities and associated vessels of developing island coastal states and territories, and would not affect investment that has occurred legally in FFA member countries, and   CMM-2005-01, para. 6: Nothing in this decision shall prejudice the legitimate rights and obligations of those small island state Members and participating territories in the Convention Area seeking to develop their own domestic fisheries."
WCPFC4,320,"Dr Tsamenyi responded that the interpretation of these provisions is not a legal issue,  rather CCMs should clarify what they intended these provisions to mean, including with respect to the definition of “domestic” fisheries. He noted that a number of resolutions were agreed on during PrepCon to address fleet capacity expansion in the period after 1999, and that these applied before the Commission was operational. CMM-2004-04, which was adopted at WCPFC1, acknowledges that all resolutions adopted during PrepCon would continue to apply until the Commission decided otherwise. He also noted that in accordance with the “Nomenclature Decision” taken at WCPFC2, CMM-2005-01 takes precedence over the Capacity Resolutions adopted by the Commission. The Chair further noted that, if the vessels that RMI and Tuvalu are seeking to import enter the fishery, then they would be administered under the Vessel Day Scheme as provided for at paragraphs 9 and 10 of CMM-2005-01."
WCPFC4,321,"Several FFA members expressed disappointment, saying that they felt discriminated against in efforts to pursue their fisheries development aspirations. They noted that while developed CCMs were expanding their fishing capacity, SIDS-CCMs were being constrained by the Commission’s interpretation of Resolution 2005-02 and domestic laws enacted by some Members. To further clarify, Chinese Taipei advised that the principles applied in its  44 domestic regulations on restrictions on the export of fishing vessels in force is not to increase capacity. The spirit of the regulations is intended to ensure that existing capacity not be increased."
WCPFC4,322,"While acknowledging the efforts of Chinese Taipei to address these real threats to sustainable fisheries development and management, some CCMs advised that they did not want a recurrence of the capacity expansion experienced in the late 1990s and early 2000s. On the other hand, all FFA members, along with the EU and China, supported RMI’s draft proposal, in particular, SIDS’ aspirations to develop their fisheries."
WCPFC4,323,"Dr Tsamenyi subsequently advised that he considered the intent of the provisions for developing SIDS members of the Commission in Resolution 2005-02 and CMM-2005-01 was to protect Pacific Island domestic fisheries aspirations. Since these decisions, RMI and Tuvalu have applied to develop their fisheries as they understood was their right to do. These applications have been denied, which has caused great concern about the implications of their rights. One significant issue relates to para 7–10 of CMM-2005-01 and the implementation of the VDS. The VDS applies to purse-seine capacity in the EEZs of PNA Member CCMs. Further, the Commission is required to implement compatible measures on the high seas and in waters under the national jurisdiction of non-PNA CCMs to control total capacity and total fishing effort in the Convention Area. He stated that with the full implementation of the VDS from 1 December 2007, capacity can theoretically be managed to ensure that the provisions of CMM-2005-01, at least in respect to fishing effort in the national waters of PNA CCMs, can be fully met. This then frees the Commission to allow Tuvalu and RMI to manage their purse-seine fishing capacity under the VDS. If that is accepted, then it becomes an issue for Chinese Taipei whether it will permit export of the vessels to fish in these areas."
WCPFC4,324,"RMI agreed fully with the analysis and interpretations in relation to the implementation of the VDS and the subsequent removal of restrictions on its acquisition of vessels. With the implementation of the VDS, the number of vessels is no longer relevant and, in the view of Tuvalu and RMI, the reasons for not permitting export of the vessels by Chinese Taipei are no longer valid. RMI stated that in order to achieve some economic independence and reduce the country’s reliance on foreign aid and development assistance, it was critical that the Commission support Marshall Islands’ efforts to develop its local tuna fisheries. The Commission’s developed CCMs cannot encourage SIDS such as RMI to develop its economy on one hand but then restrict its efforts to do that by placing unreasonable constraints on its ability to use the only economic resource it has, tuna.  Many FFA and non-FFA CCMs expressed support for this aspiration. Niue, in supporting RMI, expressed its grave concern of the applications of new entrants, particularly while CCMs’ support for SIDS is questioned."
WCPFC4,325," Recalling the discussion at WCPFC3 in December 2006, which is reflected in para 88 of WCPFC3’s Summary Record, WCPFC4 agreed that: a. in relation to para 2 of Resolution-2005-02 and para 6 of CMM-2005-01, the Commission confirmed the understanding of SIDS members that these provisions had been accepted by SIDS on the basis that the legitimate right of SIDS to develop their domestic fisheries was not constrained by these provisions;  b. the VDS was now operational and that the VDS is the measure adopted by PNA members of the Commission for managing capacity and fishing effort in the EEZs of PNA members. It was agreed that the PNA would provide a report to the Commission on the implementation of the VDS at each annual session of the Commission;  45 c. in relation to the request by RMI and Tuvalu to acquire new boats for their domestic development, the overcapacity resolution, as it relates to purse-seine fishing effort in the waters of PNA members has to be interpreted and applied by reference to CMM-2005-01, in particular the implementation of the VDS as provided for in CMM-2005-01, and not the 1999, 2002 and 2005 capacity resolutions; d. the Executive Director will commence a process in early 2008 to support the implementation of similar measures to limit purse-seine effort on the high seas, consistent with para 9 of CMM 2005-01, and in waters under the national jurisdiction of non-PNA members of the Commission, consistent with para 10(ii) of CMM-2005-01; and e. a consultation for CCMs to further discuss strategies for promoting the development aspirations of SIDS members of the Commission be organized for mid-2008 with the Chair to develop a suitable agenda intersessionally with CCMs."
WCPFC4,326,"Tuvalu, on behalf of developing State CCMs, thanked the Commission for its understanding and noted its understanding that the resolution on overcapacity cannot be used as a tool for developed CCMs to obstruct developing State CCMs from acquiring new purse-seine vessels. Tuvalu noted that as a result of the decision in relation to the development aspirations of SIDS at WCPFC4, efforts by RMI to have its two purse-seine vessels released by Chinese Taipei and the application from Tuvalu cannot be refused on the basis of the Resolution on Overcapacity (Resolution 2005-02). The Chair responded that it was his understanding that the issues for Tuvalu and RMI was resolved, and that this was subsequently reflected in para 325. Further, the Commission recognized the importance of SIDS development aspirations, and the need for sustainable management measures for the regional tuna stock. 8.2 Allocation"
WCPFC4,327,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC4-2007/14, which summarizes the history of consideration of the allocation issue by WCPFC. Two CCMs provided comments on a discussion paper presented at WCPFC3 (WCPFC3-2006/15) in 2007. WCPFC4 was invited to discuss options for further consideration of the allocation issue in the coming year."
WCPFC4,328,New Zealand stated that it felt holding an allocation workshop in 2008 would be premature.
WCPFC4,329,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA-member CCMs, stressed the critical nature of determining equitable allocation arrangements for the development of SIDS, for the implementation of effective CMMs and for economic security for all CCMs. However, given the other priority issues facing the SC, TCC and Commission, it has not been possible to undertake the work programme outlined in WCPFC3-2007/15. Nevertheless, these CCMs will certainly be working to advance this issue over the next year."
WCPFC4,330,"Tuvalu echoed the points made by New Zealand, stating their expectation that the Commission will develop total allowable catch and effort limits for the high seas but will not prescribe allocations within EEZs."
WCPFC4,331,WCPFC4 agreed to retain allocation as an agenda item for next year’s meeting but noted it is not one of the top priority items for 2008.   46 AGENDA  ITEM  9  -  ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION
WCPFC4,332,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC4-2007/15, which summarizes the work of the Commission during the past year.  He expressed his sincere appreciation to Bernard Thoulag and the staff from the National Oceanic Resource Management Authority (NORMA), FSM during the last 12 months for their support in establishing the Secretariat’s office in Pohnpei."
WCPFC4,333,"The Chair congratulated the Executive Director on the excellent work of the Secretariat over the last year. He noted, in particular, the opening of the new Secretariat headquarters building at Pohnpei and reiterated a request for each CCM to consider furnishing a room in the headquarters building, using elements of their own national style."
WCPFC4,334,"Canada, on behalf of other CCMs, thanked the People’s Republic of China for their significant contribution to the new headquarters building.    AGENDA  ITEM  10  -  REPORT OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE"
WCPFC4,335,"Mr Terry Toomata (Samoa), Co-Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC), presented FAC’s Summary Report (WCPFC4-2007/16) (Attachment P)."
WCPFC4,336,The Chair acknowledged the cooperative nature of the discussion of budget issues at WCPFC4 and thanked all participants for their cooperation.
WCPFC4,337,"Vanuatu noted, and the Commission confirmed, that its contribution has been received."
WCPFC4,338,WCPFC4 adopted all the recommendations of the FAC without refinement.    AGENDA  ITEM  11  -  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES
WCPFC4,339,"Noting that this is a standing agenda item, the Chair acknowledged a proposal put forward by RMI on this issue (WCPFC4-2007/DP07) as a positive step."
WCPFC4,340,"Tokelau, on behalf of FFA, expressed appreciation for the Secretariat’s management of the Commission’s Special Requirements Fund, which allows for the continued participation of these States in the work of the Commission, and encouraged CCMs to contribute to this fund."
WCPFC4,341,"The contributions of the USA and FSM to this fund were acknowledged with appreciation, along with the requirement for ongoing contributions to this fund.    AGENDA  ITEM  12  -  COOPERATION WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS"
WCPFC4,342,"The Executive Director presented a paper on the Commission’s efforts to date, and activities planned for 2008, to strengthen cooperation, consultation and collaboration with other RFMOs and relevant national and international organizations (WCPFC4-2007/18). The following items were raised for the Commission’s consideration: a. authorization of a schedule of work, defined through the work of SC3, FAC and WCPFC4 (see Agenda Items 4.4 and 10) to be offered to SPC-OFP as the provider of scientific services to the Commission;  47 b. advice and recommendations in relation to the development of a formal understanding for cooperation, consultation and collaboration with the UN FAO, the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES) and ICCAT; c. provide any additional appropriate advice and recommendations in respect of the relationship with IATTC; d. review, refine as considered necessary, and endorse the proposed memorandum of understanding (MoU) with FFA; e. review, refine as considered necessary, and endorse the proposed MoU with CCAMLR; f. review, refine as considered necessary, and endorse the proposed MoU with IOTC; g. review, refine as considered necessary, and endorse the proposed MoU with the ACAP; h. review, refine as considered necessary, and endorse the proposed MoU with the SPREP; and  i. provide advice and recommendations in relation to the possible development of collaborative relations with other organisations or institutions."
WCPFC4,343,"The Executive Director introduced a correction to para 15 of WCPFC4-2007/18, noting that the MoU with FFA has been signed by both parties. The priority items were identified as being the MoU with SPC; advice on the relationship with IATTC; progressing the MoU with CCAMLR upon receipt of comments on the draft MoU from CCAMLR; finalization of the MoU with ACAP; and adoption of the MoU with SPREP."
WCPFC4,344,"Vanuatu, on behalf of FFA members, stressed the importance of data sharing, including data on vessels, vessel owners and management measures, as a critical component of cooperation with other organizations."
WCPFC4,345,"Some CCMs stressed the importance of the relationship between WCPFC and IATTC, noting that the common boundary between the two RFMOs highlights issues of mutual interest such as authorization to fish and IUU fishing, potential double counting of catch, and the need for harmonized management frameworks."
WCPFC4,346,Chinese Taipei suggested that special provisions governing the co-location of the Commission’s VMS with the FFA’s VMS should be developed as an Annex to the MoU with FFA.
WCPFC4,347,"The USA provided the following comments: a. MoUs with FAO, PICES and ICCAT should not be pursued formally given time constraints, but informal contact should be maintained; b. Opportunities to coordinate with the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) should be considered given the interaction of these fisheries with albacore fisheries in the North Pacific;  c. WCPFC should participate in a workshop being held by FAO next year on port State measures;  d. WCPFC should be aware of, and strive to assist in, CCAMLR’s efforts to reduce seabird mortality by using CCAMLR’s measures as reference documents in SC and TCC deliberations, particularly where seabird species’ distributions overlap the Convention Areas of both the WCPFC and the CCAMLR.     48"
WCPFC4,348,"New Zealand explained that its minor proposed amendments to the MoU with ACAP (WCPFC4-2007/18 Rev.1, Attachment H) are designed to re-cast the language of the document as an arrangement rather than an agreement (or MoU). This was necessary because WCPFC is entering into a non-legally binding relationship with ACAP."
WCPFC4,349,Australia noted the need for a special relationship not only with IATTC but also with IOTC due to a shared boundary in the WCPO. Support for assisting CCAMLR in seabird mortality reduction efforts was also expressed.
WCPFC4,350,"Canada noted that it is hosting a tri-party workshop between NPAFC, WCPFC and North Pacific Coast Guard Forces in connection with the next meeting of the NPAFC in order to promote cooperation and effective use of resources."
WCPFC4,351,"The Commission adopted the MoU with IOTC (WCPFC4-2007/18 Rev.1, Attachment G), the MoU with SPREP (WCPFC-2007/18 Rev. 1, Attachment I), and the MoU with ACAP as modified by New Zealand (WCPFC4-2007/18 Rev.1, Attachment H).    AGENDA  ITEM  13  -  WORK PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2008 AND INDICATIVE WORK PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2009 AND 2010"
WCPFC4,352,"WCPFC4 adopted the recommendations of the FAC with regards to the 2008 work programme and budget as revised, and an indicative budget for 2009 and 2010."
WCPFC4,353,"The Chair identified the priority issues for the Commission in 2008 as:   a. development of a CMM for bigeye and yellowfin tuna; b. development of compatible measures for the high seas, including development of measures for the high seas and for EEZs of other non-PNA CCMs, which are compatible with those measures applicable to the PNA members of the Commission consistent with paras 9 and 10 of CMM-2005-01; c. development of a CMM that regulates transhipment activities; and d. development of an improved and rationalized process for considering applications for CNM status."
WCPFC4,354,"The EC suggested that development of a CDS be considered as a priority for the coming year. Japan expressed reservations on the priority of developing a CDS, although it noted its willingness to cooperate in discussion on this issue."
WCPFC4,355,The USA suggested that further measures to reduce sea turtle bycatch might also be considered a priority.   AGENDA  ITEM  14  -  ELECTION OF OFFICERS
WCPFC4,356,"WCPFC4 confirmed the election of Keith Bigelow (USA) as Vice-Chair of the SC; Wendell Sanford (Canada) as Chair of the TCC; Noan Pakop (PNG) as Vice-Chair of the TCC; Charles Karnella (USA) as chair of the Interim Working Group on the Regional Observer Programme; Masanori Miyahara (Japan) as Chair of the Northern Committee; Terry Toomata (Samoa) and Dean Swanson (USA) as Co-Chairs of the FAC.     49 AGENDA  ITEM  15  -  OTHER MATTERS  15.1 Outcomes of the joint meeting of tuna RFMOs, Kobe, Japan, 22–26 January 2007"
WCPFC4,357,The Executive Director noted a proposed meeting of the Chairs and Executive Directors of the tuna RFMOs to be held in the USA in early 2008.
WCPFC4,358,The USA and New Zealand encouraged the Commission to continue to progress on key issues identified as priorities in the course of action recommended by the Kobe meeting.
WCPFC4,359,WCPFC4 adopted the proposed roadmap developed by the Kobe meeting and agreed to cooperate with other RFMOs toward standardization of performance reviews.  15.2 Proposed performance reviews of tuna RFMOs
WCPFC4,360,"Australia proposed that the WCPFC undertake a performance review consistent with the recommendations of the Kobe meeting, and offered specific guidance on the issue in WCPFC4-2007/DP05."
WCPFC4,361,"Japan agreed that the performance review is important, but suggested it be postponed until 2009 due to a lack of time to fully consider the issue. In this way, the results of the science structure review to be conducted in 2008 can be incorporated into the broader Kobe review in 2009."
WCPFC4,362,The Commission agreed to defer further consideration of the WCPFC performance review to WCPFC5.   15.3 Other issues
WCPFC4,363,"The USA noted recent positive developments at the United Nations regarding shark conservation and management. In informal consultations to negotiate the annual United Nations general Assembly (UNGA) Sustainable Fisheries Resolution this year, participating States agreed by consensus to new text that includes strong calls to States and RFMOs, such as the WCPFC, to adopt measures to manage both directed and non-directed shark fisheries, and, where scientific information is uncertain or inadequate, not increasing fishing effort in directed shark fisheries until conservation and management measures have been established. In addition, the resolution calls for concerted action to improve the implementation of and compliance with existing RFMOs and national measures that regulate shark fisheries."
WCPFC4,364,"The USA also highlighted the problems of marine debris and derelict fishing gear (WCPFC4-2007/IP11), and suggested that this issue should be considered in future by the WCPFC."
WCPFC4,365,"The Chair raised the issue of unregulated drift net fishing in the North Pacific in the areas fished under the NPAFC. Robert Martinolich, Chair of NPAFC’s Enforcement Committee noted that illegal drift netting occurs in the area but that there is no real link between these activities and tuna. Some of the apprehended vessels were found with albacore comprising up to 3% of their catch onboard although their main target was squid.     50"
WCPFC4,366,"The Chair tasked the TCC with looking into a possible connection between illegal drift netting and impacts on northern stocks of albacore, and providing a report to WCPFC5 on the matter.    AGENDA  ITEM  16  -  NEXT MEETING"
WCPFC4,367,Korea offered to host WCPFC5 in Busan from 8–12 December 2008.
WCPFC4,368,Guam thanked the Commission for choosing Guam as the venue for WCPFC4 and offered its support for future meetings.
WCPFC4,369,The EC expressed its concern that meetings of the Commission and its committees and working groups be coordinated and rationalized with meetings of other RFMOs.    AGENDA  ITEM  17  -  SUMMARY REPORT
WCPFC4,370,"A draft version of the WCPFC4 Summary Report was prepared by the rapporteur and finalized by the Secretariat. It was circulated to CCMs for comment on 14 December 2007.  After the 30-day comment period elapsed, comments were incorporated into the WCPFC4 Summary Report and finalized and posted on WCPFC’s website on 18 February 2008.    AGENDA  ITEM  18  -  CLOSE OF MEETING"
WCPFC4,371,"The Executive Director thanked all of the staff who supported the smooth running of the meeting, including the Governor and Vice-Governor of Guam, John Calvo of the Western Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Council office at Guam, Guam-based volunteer support staff, and staff of the Hyatt Regency Guam. Manny Duenas of the Guam Fishermen’s Cooperative Association graciously hosted nightly hospitality functions throughout the meeting. Emmanuel Schneiter (SPC) was acknowledged for his work on the Commission’s website, and Secretariat staff, Shelley Clarke, Iain Hayes and Martin Tsamenyi were thanked for their efforts."
WCPFC4,372,RMI thanked the Commission for its assistance in resolving issues associated with SIDS but expressed its disappointment that more progress was not made on other CMMs.
WCPFC4,373,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA-member CCMs, acknowledged progress made by the working groups on the ROP and the VMS, but regretted the failure of the Commission to agree on more effective management measures for critical fish stocks. These CCMs promised to advance the issues of allocation and MCS issues over the coming year."
WCPFC4,374,"The Chair closed WCPFC4 at 18:45 on Friday, 7 December 2007."
WCPFC5,1,"The Fifth Regular Session of the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC5) took place from 8–12 December 2008 at Busan, Korea.

WCPFC5,9,"An opening address was delivered by Park Deok-Bae, Vice Minister from the Korean Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MIFAFF) (Attachment B). Samoa, on behalf of Commission members, thanked the host country for its hospitality."
WCPFC5,10,"The Chair made an opening statement (Attachment C), highlighting four key items before the Commission at WCPFC5, including a conservation and management measure (CMM) for bigeye and yellowfin tuna, a CMM for transhipment, compatible measures between exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and the high seas, and decisions on the application process for CNMs.   1.2 Adoption of agenda"
WCPFC5,11,The Commission adopted the agenda contained in WCPFC5-2008/03 Rev.3 and the provisional schedule of work contained in WCPFC5-2008/04 Rev.4.  1.3 Meeting arrangements
WCPFC5,12,"The WCPFC Executive Director, Andrew Wright, introduced Secretariat technical staff attending the meeting, including Andrew Richards, Compliance Manager; Ken Smithson, Finance and Administrative Officer; SungKwon Soh, Science Manager; Karl Staisch, Observer Programme Coordinator; and Ziro Suzuki, Japan Trust Fund Coordinator. In addition to Secretariat staff, Shelley Clarke served as rapporteur; Campbell Davies, Iain Hayes and Graeme Parkes participated as technical advisors on various subjects; and Martin Tsamenyi attended the meeting as the legal advisor. Herolyn Movick and Lucille Martinez of the WCPFC Secretariat, supported by Jeanny Relations (Busan), handled administrative arrangements.   AGENDA  ITEM  2  -  MEMBERSHIP   2.1 Status of the Convention"
WCPFC5,13,"The depository for the Convention, New Zealand, presented WCPFC5-2008/07, summarizing the status of the Convention as of 10 November 2008. New Zealand noted that since its last report at WCPFC4, it has not received notification of any instruments of ratification of or accession to the Convention.   2.2 Applications for Observer status"
WCPFC5,14,"Observer status was granted to the following four new applicants: Liberia,Vietnam,  International Sustainable Seafood Foundation, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).   3  2.3 Applications for Cooperating Non-member status"
WCPFC5,15,"The Commission considered applications from Belize and Indonesia for the renewal of their CNM status, and new applications from Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico and Senegal.  Documentation supporting these applications was distributed to delegations as WCPFC5-2008/08, and a summary of these materials was provided as WCPFC5-2008/IP10."
WCPFC5,16,Indonesia presented a statement summarizing its application for renewal of its CNM status for 2009 (Attachment D).
WCPFC5,17,WCPFC5 approved Indonesia’s application for CNM status for 2009.
WCPFC5,18,Belize presented a statement summarising its application for renewal of its CNM status for 2009 (Attachment E).
WCPFC5,19,"Some CCMs, while not opposing Belize’s application, expressed concern about the beneficial ownership of some fishing vessels flagged to Belize and currently operating in the WCPF Convention Area, and the extent to which Belize could exercise control over its vessels, and currently operating in the WCPF Convention Area. One member noted the relevance of “real interest” and the need to ensure that States are not able to come into the region, fish in an illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fashion, and then claim CNM status. Concern was expressed that the failure of other regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) was leading to an increase in capacity in the WCPFC region, and that only applicants that could demonstrate a past presence in the region should receive CNM status. It was incumbent on the Commission to place limits, in line with those of past efforts, and accept applicants but limit capacity effort."
WCPFC5,20,"Belize asked that the focus remain on the compliance record of the beneficial owner, not simply the State from which the beneficial owner operates. Belize also noted the desirability of maintaining consistent standards with regard to beneficial ownership for both members and CNMs."
WCPFC5,21,"Other Cooperating Non-members and participating Territories (CCMs) fully supported Belize’s application, acknowledging its record of compliance with CMMs developed by the WCPFC and information requests over the past year."
WCPFC5,22,"In response to Belize’s stated intention to seek full membership in the Commission, some FFA members noted that the granting of CNM status should not be viewed as conferment of a right to become a Commission Member, or to seek an allocation that could lead to overcapacity and overfishing. Clarification was also sought as to whether ratification of, or accession to, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement  (UNFSA)  should be necessary requirements for CNM status."
WCPFC5,23,"Martin Tsamenyi explained that CMM 2004-02 does not require ratification of, or accession to, the UNCLOS or UNFSA as prerequisites for CNM status. He noted that there are some Commission Members who are not parties to both treaties.    4"
WCPFC5,24,"Some FFA members stated their support for CNM applications, which provide opportunities for small island developing State (SIDS) members of the Commission and participating territories to maximize economic benefits from the sustainable management of the tuna resources in the Convention Area."
WCPFC5,25,"WCPFC5 approved Belize’s application for CNM status for 2009, with the understanding that Belize will cooperate with WCPFC Members in the monitoring and control of its longline vessels."
WCPFC5,26,"The Chair noted that Belize had written to contracting parties requesting an invitation to accede to the Convention, and asked the Executive Director to progress this matter inter-sessionally."
WCPFC5,27,"El Salvador presented a statement supporting its application for CNM status (Attachment F). El Salvador committed to limiting its fishing in the Convention Area to two vessels that were granted licenses to fish in Kiribati’s EEZ, although El Salvador noted an interest in entering into further licensing arrangements with coastal State Commission Members should such opportunities become available under the vessel day scheme (VDS)."
WCPFC5,28,"Representatives of the FFA Secretariat and Kiribati stated that the two El Salvadorean vessels fishing in Kiribati’s EEZ in 2008 complied with vessel monitoring system (VMS) requirements for part of the time: one vessel reported from July to the present, and the other reported in April–May and in October–November. It was noted that reporting began in April 2008 because up until that time, these vessels were not on the WCPFC Record of Vessels and, thus, could not be entered into the FFA vessel registry."
WCPFC5,29,"In response to a request for clarification, Martin Tsamenyi explained that, under CMM 2004-01, Commission Members have agreed not to license non-members of the Commission or CNMs to fish in the Convention Area. Therefore, unless CMM 2004-01 is amended, coastal State Commission Members would be in violation of CMM 2004-01 if they license non-CCMs to fish in their EEZs."
WCPFC5,30,"In response to a question regarding its accession to UNCLOS and UNFSA, El Salvador responded that its accession was complicated by domestic legal issues but that its status with regard to these treaties notwithstanding, its intention in applying for CNM status was to comply with all applicable WCPFC CMMs."
WCPFC5,31,"With regard to El Salvador’s history of fishing on the high seas in the Convention Area in 2001–2004, 29 days of fishing had been recorded in the data available to the Commission."
WCPFC5,32,"Following reaffirmation from El Salvador that it would operate only two purse seiners in the WCPF Convention Area, and that its operations on the high seas would be in accordance with existing CMMs adopted by the Commission, WCPFC5 approved El Salvador’s application for CNM status for 2009."
WCPFC5,33,"Ecuador, Senegal and Mexico presented statements supporting their applications for CNM status (Attachments G, H and I)."
WCPFC5,34,"It was agreed that these three applications would be evaluated against a flowchart, based on CMM 2004-02, developed at Fourth Regular Session of the Technical and  5 Compliance Committee (TCC4 Summary Report, Attachment I) by a small group consisting of representatives from the USA and PNG. In addition to applying the flowchart to the applications, the USA and PNG co-facilitators met with applicants to clarify any outstanding issues; to confirm their understanding of how CMMs will apply to their existing or proposed fishing activities; and to explore whether each applicant was proposing any voluntary agreements to limit its catch or effort in the Convention Area given the status of the stocks."
WCPFC5,35,"Regarding Ecuador, the USA and PNG found that the application generally met the criteria for CNM status, but that there remained issues regarding the provision of operational data. In particular, due to gaps in the VMS record for seven Ecuadorean vessels fishing under license to Kiribati, there were questions regarding whether the operations of all of these vessels were conducted wholly within Kiribati’s national waters. It was noted that at WCPFC4, Kiribati committed to including a requirement for the Ecuadorean vessels to refrain from fishing on the high seas as a condition on their licenses."
WCPFC5,36,"In addition to the concerns raised by the group about possible unauthorized fishing on the high seas of the Convention Area by Ecuador over the past year, the USA stated that the historical data provided by Ecuador in support of its CNM application, indicated that there had been illegal operations conducted in the USA’s EEZ.  In addition, the USA stated that it has sought information and cooperation from Ecuador over the past 18 months regarding additional illegal fishing activity by Ecuadorian-flagged vessels in the USA EEZ and in other Member’s national waters. Despite attempts to settle this issue with Ecuadorean representatives, the USA noted that its concerns remain unresolved and, thus, it could not support Ecuador’s application."
WCPFC5,37,Ecuador responded that it is investigating the issues raised by the USA through its own internal procedures. A legal opinion has been sought from the Ecuadorian Attorney General and matters cannot proceed until this opinion is provided.
WCPFC5,38,"Other CCMs agreed that if Ecuador fished in the Convention Area outside of Kiribati’s EEZ in 2008, then i) such operations were clearly unsanctioned by the Commission; ii) Ecuador’s application for CNM status should not be approved due to failure to demonstrate a favourable record of compliance with Convention provisions and WCPFC CMMs adopted under para 5 of CMM 2004-02; and iii) punitive measures should be considered."
WCPFC5,39,"Kiribati spoke in favour of Ecuador’s application, emphasizing the importance of the existing Ecuadorean licenses to its economy. Kiribati asserted that issues with implementation of the VMS are being handled by FFA and that reports from Kiribati’s observers on board two of the Ecuadorean vessels will be provided to the Commission. Kiribati stated that according to its understanding, the Ecuadorean vessels were not fishing on the high seas."
WCPFC5,40,"Tuvalu also expressed its support for Ecuador’s application. Tuvalu reminded the Commission that it will be necessary to enter into bilateral arrangements with countries such as Ecuador in order to develop its fishery and realize the economic benefits of that development.  Tuvalu therefore supported Ecuador’s application. As a further step, Tuvalu requested that CMM 2004-01 and CMM 2004-02 be amended to allow SIDS to license non-Members to fish in their national waters on the understanding that such fishing would comply with all WCPFC CMMs.    6"
WCPFC5,41,"WCPFC5 agreed to approve Ecuador’s CNM status for a one-year period beginning 15 February 2009, subject to the following conditions (WCPFC5-2008/IP15):    a. Ecuador is granted Cooperating Non-member status for 2009, contingent upon satisfactory resolution of the USA’s concerns over the provision of necessary information relating to alleged violations in its EEZ. If Ecuador does not provide all requested information to the satisfaction of the USA by 15 February 2009, its Cooperating Non-member status will be null and void. If the USA’s concerns have been addressed by 15 February 2009, it will certify to the WCPFC Secretariat its satisfaction with the information provided.   b. The exemption granted to Kiribati at WCPFC4, allowing it to license fishing vessels from non-CCMs, will expire on 15 February 2009.   c. If Ecuador’s Cooperating Non-member status becomes null and void, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Nauru will be given an exemption for 2009 from CMM 2004-01 to allow seven Ecuadorian vessels to fish in waters under their national jurisdiction. It shall be a term and condition of the licenses for those vessels to fish in Kiribati, Tuvalu and Nauru waters that those vessels are not authorized to fish on the high seas of the Convention Area. In addition, this exemption is granted with the understanding that no other Ecuadorian-flagged vessels will fish on the high seas of the Convention Area. Such activities will be considered as undermining the intent and effectiveness of WCPFC conservation and management measures. d. Should Ecuador’s Cooperating Non-member status become effective, the following provisions would apply.   i. Ecuador commits that it will submit to high seas boardings and inspections in accordance with the Commission’s High Seas Boarding and Inspection procedures. ii. Noting that at the time of making the decision, the Commission had not received sufficient data to be able to confirm the applicable purse-seine days limit for Ecuador on the high seas for 2009. Consequently, Ecuador will be limited to zero days during 2009. The Commission noted that as soon as Ecuador provides to the WCPFC all relevant catch and effort data that would enable the WCPFC Secretariat to calculate and verify an applicable days limit pursuant to the new CMM for yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna, this limit will be appropriately adjusted. If this is not able to be verified to the satisfaction of all members, Ecuador shall not fish on the high seas of the Convention Area in 2009. iii. Ecuador is willing and able to ensure full compliance by all its vessels with the conservation and management measures of the WCPFC and to respond to any alleged unauthorized activities by vessels flying its flag that have been brought to its attention.   iv. Ecuador commits to provide all fishery data required by the Commission in a timely manner.   v. Ecuador commits to comply with appropriate bilateral agreements and national laws and regulations of coastal States.   vi. Ecuador commits to have observers on board Ecuadorian-flagged vessels during all trips in the Convention Area, including high seas and EEZs.     7"
WCPFC5,42,"All CCMs and CNM applicants were reminded that because the official language of the Commission is English, all documents submitted to the Commission must be prepared in English, or accompanied by an English translation."
WCPFC5,43,"Regarding Senegal’s application for CNM status, the working group found that it met the criteria of CMM 2004-02."
WCPFC5,44,"Senegal committed to limiting its fishing activities in the WCPF Convention Area to one longline vessel, the Robaleira, which was fishing in 2005. This represents a reduction in Senegal’s fishing capacity in the Convention Area since 2007 when both the Robaleira and the Vieirasa fished in the Convention Area (WCPFC-2008/OP10 (Rev.1))."
WCPFC5,45,"One CCM questioned the data provided in Senegal’s supplemental documentation, in particular the very high catches of skipjack reported by the Robaleira in 2006, and inconsistent ratios of reported swordfish to shark catches, and asked that this be examined and that the Commission revisit how the proposed measure on swordfish would apply to Senegal."
WCPFC5,46,"Noting the concern regarding the species composition of the catches reported by Senegal to the Commission in WCPFC5-2008/OP10 (Rev. 1), and Senegal’s commitment to limit fishing activity to one longline vessel, WCPFC5 agreed to grant CNM status to Senegal for 2009."
WCPFC5,47,"Regarding Mexico’s application for CNM status, the working group found that it met the criteria in CMM 2004-02."
WCPFC5,48,"Mexico committed to the following (WCPFC5-2008/OP06):  a. Submission of all data required by the Commission in a timely manner; b. Full participation in the Commission VMS programme; c. Applicable requirements pertaining to WCPFC observer programmes; d. Limiting its fishing effort to not more than six purse-seine vessels fishing only in the EEZs of WCPFC Members, in accordance with appropriate bilateral agreements and pursuant to the VDS; e. Ensuring there is no transfer of effort from the IATTC area into the WCPF Convention Area during any IATTC closures; f. Abiding by all of the WCPFC CMMs, consistent with the above and with all relevant rights and duties under international law; g. Full cooperation with WCPFC Members in the conservation and management of Pacific bluefin tuna; and h. Full cooperation with WCPFC Members, particularly with SIDS."
WCPFC5,49,"Chinese Taipei and Japan spoke in support of Mexico’s application, citing its long history of fishing and good record of compliance in other RFMOs."
WCPFC5,50,"In response to a question, Mexico clarified that it is not currently a party to any bilateral access agreements in the WCPF Convention Area, as it did not yet have CNM status, but that if its CNM application is successful it may consider such arrangements."
WCPFC5,51,"Noting a number of compliance commitments and a voluntary agreement to limit fishing effort to no more than six purse-seine vessels fishing only in waters under  8 national jurisdiction of EEZs of WCPFC members, WCPFC5 agreed to grant CNM status to Mexico for 2009.    AGENDA  ITEM  3  -  MEMBER STATEMENTS 3.1 Statements by CCMs"
WCPFC5,52,"French Polynesia formally offered to host the Sixth Regular Session of WCPFC (WCPFC6) in Tahiti (Attachment J). Statements were also made by Kiribati, New Caledonia, Chinese Taipei, Palau (on behalf of FFA members), Tokelau, FSM and the Philippines. These statements are contained in Attachments K through Q.   AGENDA  ITEM  4  -  SCIENCE ISSUES 4.1 Report of the Fourth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee"
WCPFC5,53,"The Chair of the Scientific Committee (Dae-Yeon Moon, Korea) presented the summary outcomes of the Fourth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee (SC4) held in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea from 11–22 August 2008."
WCPFC5,54,"The matters considered by the Scientific Committee (SC) and its six Specialist Working Groups included: • a review of the fisheries in the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) and the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO); • a review of stock status of bigeye tuna, skipjack tuna and southern albacore in the Convention Area; swordfish and striped marlin stocks in the South Pacific; and northern area stocks, including albacore, Pacific bluefin tuna, striped marlin and swordfish; • a review of a research proposal on Pacific-wide bigeye tuna biology, and a project report on reference points and management strategy evaluation (MSE); • bycatch mitigation issues and ecological risk assessment (ERA);  • issues associated with data available to the Commission and initiatives to address data gaps, the status of the Indonesia and Philippines Data Collection Project, and the Pacific Tuna Tagging Programme; • cooperation with other organizations; • the special requirements of SIDS and territories; • the process for developing the SC work programme and the 2009–2011 SC work programme; and • administrative matters associated with the functioning of the SC."
WCPFC5,55,"John Hampton (SPC-Oceanic Fisheries Programme, SPC-OFP), Scientific Services Provider) made a presentation on the status of the stocks as discussed at SC4 in August 2008. This presentation highlighted that the latest stock assessments had determined that for yellowfin tuna, there is a relatively high possibility that overfishing is occurring and that there is a small probability that it is in an overfished state; for bigeye tuna overfishing is occurring in the WCPO with a high probability that both adult and total biomass are predicted to become over-fished at 2003–2006 levels of fishing mortality and long-term average levels of recruitment.    9"
WCPFC5,56,"In response to questions, John. Hampton made the following points:  a. Declines in the number of skipjack migrating toward the coast of Japan as reported by Japanese fishermen might be a cause for concern if they represent a range contraction. While Japanese data are used in assessments, most data derive from equatorial areas.   b. Above-average bigeye tuna recruitment since 1985 has allowed the stock to remain above maximum sustainable yield (MSY) levels despite high levels of fishing mortality.   c. Catch data for the purse-seine fishery may underestimate the actual catch of bigeye tuna by a substantial amount. If so, the results of the stock assessment would be more pessimistic, and a greater proportion of stock depletion would be attributed to the purse-seine fishery.   d. The recent assessment of South Pacific swordfish conducted by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO, Australia) and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New Zealand focused on the southwestern portion (west of 180o) of the WCPO. Attempts were made to construct a model, including the south-central Pacific, however there were problems with this approach due to the relatively weak data available for the assessment for the south-central area.  There was also a suggestion of relatively low mixing of swordfish between the southwest and south-central areas.   e. Critical uncertainties in some bigeye tuna data remain, particularly estimates for the purse-seine and Indonesian and Philippines domestic fisheries. The regional observer programme and the Indonesia-Philippines Data Collection Project are expected to improve data quality.  f. Emerging evidence from IATTC tagging studies show limited movement of bigeye tuna from the EPO to the WCPF Convention Area, but movements of bigeye tuna from the Central Pacific are less well known. Although separation of the stock into the IATTC and WCPFC areas is problematic, it is still feasible to manage bigeye in the two areas separately. SPC and IATTC routinely discuss and compare stock assessments of bigeye tuna, including comparison with a Pacific-wide model.   g. The results of the southern swordfish assessment are based on data for the southwest areas and, thus, apply only to that portion of the stock.   h. SPC regularly produces statistics on the rate of bycatch and discards in the purse-seine fishery. The rate is generally low (<5%).   4.2 Review of transitional arrangements for science structure and function"
WCPFC5,57,Graeme Parkes (Marine Resources Assessment Group – MRAG) presented a report on the Independent Review of the Commission’s Transitional Science Structure and Functions (WCPFC5-2008/11). The review encompassed an evaluation of scientific data and information functions; science functions; and institutional analysis. A number of recommendations were made with regard to data submission; data management and confidentiality; data custodianship services; contracting of research; standards for contracted research; conflicts of interest; cost effectiveness of contracted research; presentation of CCM research at the SC; review of ISC assessments; resourcing in the Secretariat; the relationship between the SC and the ISC; and organization of the SC.     10
WCPFC5,58,"In discussion, one CCM raised the need to provide a quantitative cost comparison of various options for data custodianship, and expressed a desire to see a quantitative evaluation of the performance of different RFMO models for research, assessment and data analysis."
WCPFC5,59,"Another CCM reiterated concerns about one of the issues presented in the report (i.e. the lack of access to background material, such as data and papers, used in the ISC assessments)."
WCPFC5,60,"Other CCMs suggested that the report could usefully elaborate on other issues, such as the need for economic and social data relating to fishing capacity; the potential for political interference in scientific work; and the possibility of reciprocal peer review arrangements between WCPFC and other RFMOs, in particular the IATTC."
WCPFC5,61,Concerns were raised that the report’s proposal to require that participants in SPC’s preparatory stock assessment workshops have scientific credentials may discriminate against FFA members.
WCPFC5,62,"Several CCMs made statements in support of the report and its proposals, including statements of appreciation for the high quality and cost-effective work of SPC as the WCPFC Science Services Provider. Many of these statements, however, suggested that the issues in the report should be discussed by the ISC, SC, Northern Committee (NC) and/or the Ad Hoc Task Group–Data before drawing any conclusions about the way forward."
WCPFC5,63,"WCPFC5 agreed that the Independent Review of the Commission’s Transitional Science Structure and Function:    a. Be finalized by the consultant following the receipt of any additional comments from CCMs by 1 March 2009; b. Be considered at the 2009 sessions of the ISC, SC, NC and/or Ad Hoc Task Group–Data; c. Be further considered at WCPFC6, taking into account the advice and recommendations of the ISC, SC, NC and/or Ad Hoc Task Group–Data."
WCPFC5,64,"In addition, WCPFC5 requested:  a. CCMs to actively work toward removing domestic barriers to data submission; b. The Secretariat work with ISC, SPC-OFP and relevant CCMs to develop a strategy for the incorporation of ISC data into the Commission’s data holdings; and  c. The Secretariat prepare for consideration of the 2009 sessions of the ISC, NC and Commission, a proposal that would support the periodic peer review of ISC and SC stock assessments. 4.3 Reference points"
WCPFC5,65,"Campbell Davies (CSIRO) presented work designed to identify the potential costs, benefits and difficulties of alternative approaches for identification of appropriate reference points within the WCPO (WCPFC5-2008/12). The presentation covered the  11 background to reference points, decision rules and risk; default reference points for WCPFC; and management strategy evaluation."
WCPFC5,66,"Work programme recommendations presented in the paper included:    • A small technical workshop (or discussion paper) to consider the technical definition of alternative limit reference points and make specific recommendations to SC and WCPFC6 on the range of potential reference points;  • Single- and multi-species case studies using short-term constant catch projections and current assessment models (southern swordfish or albacore and the tropical tuna species mix, respectively, were recommended);  • A capacity building workshop(s) for CCMs on reference points and MSE convened as a special workshop under the Methods Working Group at SC5.   • A management objectives workshop for discussion and recommendations to the Commission on technical interpretation and specification of fisheries management objectives."
WCPFC5,67,Several CCMs stated their strong support for articulation of the Commission’s fisheries management objectives and the development of reference points as tools for effective implementation of these objectives.
WCPFC5,68,"Some of these CCMs, in addition to stating their general support for ongoing work, expressed a desire for more capacity building and a more inclusive and collaborative approach to development of WCPFC management objectives and reference points. It was acknowledged that it would take time for all parties to gain a detailed understanding of the issues."
WCPFC5,69,The Commission agreed that SC5 should convene a seminar under the Methods Working Group on technical issues associated with reference points.
WCPFC5,70,The Commission agreed that WCPFC6 should consider the possibility of holding a dedicated workshop on management objectives in 2010.   4.4 Allocation
WCPFC5,71,"The Chair introduced a paper on allocation (WCPFC5-2008/20), reminding the Commission that this issue was raised at WCPFC3, but following limited discussion at WCPFC4, it was deferred to WCPFC5."
WCPFC5,72,"Several CCMs, including FFA members, noted that although allocation issues are important, work on these issues is not a high priority task for the Commission at present. It was considered that discussion of allocation would be best conducted as a component of an overall strategic management plan once management objectives, reference points and total allowable catch (TAC) and/or total allowable effort (TAE) are identified and agreed on by the Commission."
WCPFC5,73,"Some CCMs representing FFA members clarified that long-term management of the resources in their EEZs is now being undertaken through the VDS, and that allocations in EEZs are decided upon by the coastal States.     12"
WCPFC5,74,"The Commission agreed that consideration of allocation issues should be merged with the Commission’s consideration of management objectives and reference points. Therefore, discussions of allocation issues at WCPFC6 will be guided by the outcomes of work on reference points and management objectives by SC5 and TCC5.   4.5 Issues from the SC4 Summary Report"
WCPFC5,75,"The Chair of the SC presented the following new recommendations of SC4 with regard to key stocks of highly migratory species in the region:  a. For WCPO bigeye tuna, a minimum 30% reduction in fishing mortality from the average levels for 2003–2006 was recommended, with the goal of returning the fishing mortality rate to FMSY. Additional reductions will be required in fishing mortality in the future if assessments indicate that fishing mortality is greater than FMSY (SC4 Summary Report, para 143); b. For WCPO skipjack tuna, the high recent catches are considered to be sustainable unless recruitment falls persistently below the long-term average (SC4 Summary Report, para 150); c. For South Pacific albacore, catches should remain at current levels (SC4 Summary Report, para 154); d. For South Pacific swordfish, due to the uncertainty in the assessment, no further increase in catch or effort was recommended (SC4 Summary Report, para 161);  e. For Pacific bluefin tuna, it was recommended that there be no further increase in fishing mortality from the current level (SC4 Summary Report, para 171); and f. For North Pacific striped marlin, the fishing mortality rate should be reduced from the current level (to 2003 or before) (SC4 Summary Report, para 188)."
WCPFC5,76,"WCPFC5 adopted the recommendations of SC4 regarding bigeye tuna, skipjack tuna, South Pacific albacore, South Pacific swordfish, Pacific bluefin tuna and North Pacific striped marlin."
WCPFC5,77,"Other SC4 recommendations provided in the SC4 Summary Report and presented to WCPFC5 included:  a. Seabirds (para 213); b. Sharks (paras 215, 218 and 220); c. Small tuna on floating objects (para 223); d. Sea turtles (para 227); e. Ecological risk assessment (para 247); f. Data gaps (paras 253 and 257); g. Catch sampling (paras 264 and 265); h. Seabird mortality (para 268); i. Data elements of the Regional Observer Programme (para 272); and j. Data confidentiality, security and dissemination (paras 295 and 296)."
WCPFC5,78,"WCPFC5 adopted the recommendations of SC4 regarding bycatch mitigation and data and information, noting that several of these recommendations will be addressed in CMMs currently under discussion at WCPFC5.     13 4.6 Programme of work for the Scientific Committee in 2009, 2010 and 2011"
WCPFC5,79,"The Chair of the SC presented the recommendations of SC4 with regard to its proposed programme of work for 2009–2011 (SC4 Summary Report, paras 314–324). This programme includes:    a. The Indonesia and Philippines Data Collection Project (IPDCP); b. Publication and distribution of the Commission’s training and educational materials; c. Refinement of bigeye tuna parameters Pacific-wide: A comprehensive review and study of bigeye tuna reproductive biology; d. Regional study of the stock structure and life history characteristics of South Pacific albacore; e. Pacific-wide tagging project; f. Use underwater videos and other tools to characterize species, size composition and spatial distribution of tunas aggregating around floating objects; g. A technical workshop to consider suitability of MSY-based reference points as default limit reference points and how they may be operationalized; h. Collection and evaluation of purse-seine species composition data; and  i. North Pacific striped marlin mitigation methods."
WCPFC5,80,"The Chair noted that the proposed expenditure has grown from US$ 745,000 last year to US$ 795,000 this year, an increase of 6%. Nevertheless, this amount represents less than 0.02% of the estimated US$ 4 billion value of the fishery."
WCPFC5,81,"FFA members reiterated their concern that holding a workshop on reference points in 2009 would be premature. Therefore, in accordance with WCPFC5 agreements under Section 4.3 above, the technical workshop on reference points (g, above) will be replaced with a seminar on the same topic at SC5, and a possible workshop on management objectives in 2010."
WCPFC5,82,"PNG drew attention to its contribution of US$ 100,000 to the scientific work of the WCPFC, stating that this funding should not be used to fund work on reference points. Rather, it should be allocated to tuna tagging and to supporting SIDS participation in technical workshops."
WCPFC5,83,"In response to a question regarding item h above, in particular how the sampling objectives and designs will be determined, the Executive Director indicated that sampling at ports will be conducted in American Samoa (Pago Pago), FSM (Pohnpei), RMI (Majuro), Solomon Islands (Honiara), PNG (Wewak and Madang), Indonesia and the Philippines. John Hampton (SPC, Science Services Provider) explained that the research would focus on onboard sampling by observers, specifically to address concerns regarding purse-seine catches, which are sorted on board before transhipment."
WCPFC5,84,One CCM requested bigeye and yellowfin tuna stock assessments be conducted every year in order to support ongoing management efforts.
WCPFC5,85,"Another CCM noted with appreciation the Commission’s efforts to move toward a more strategic approach to its research planning, thereby allowing it to anticipate issues that will require focused scientific input.     14"
WCPFC5,86,WCPFC5 adopted the report of SC4 and thanked outgoing Chair Dae-Yeon Moon for his dedicated efforts to progress the work of the Scientific Committee over the past three years.   AGENDA  ITEM  5  -  NORTHERN COMMITTEE 5.1 Report of the Fourth Regular Session of the Northern Committee
WCPFC5,87,"The Chair of the Northern Committee, Masanori Miyahara (Japan), summarized the outcomes of the Fourth Regular Session of the Northern Committee (NC4), which met in Tokyo, Japan, 11–13 September 2008. NC4 considered the advice received from the 8th meeting of the ISC and the status of northern stocks. The report of the NC4 included reference to:   • the NC’s establishment of an interim management objective for North Pacific albacore;  • the NC’s recommended CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna, contingent on Korea lifting its reservation;  • the progress of the NC Working Group (WG) on striped marlin, and the NC'’ recommendations regarding the work of the WG;  • the NC’s recommendation regarding large-scale driftnets on the high seas in the Convention Area;  • the NC’s consideration of improvements to the North Pacific albacore CMM, which it plans to revisit at NC5."
WCPFC5,88,The management recommendation for North Pacific albacore is that fishing mortality should not be increased.
WCPFC5,89,"The recommendations for Pacific bluefin tuna are:    • That the current level of fishing mortality not be increased; • If fishing mortality remains at the current level and environmental conditions remain favorable, then recruitment should be sufficient to maintain current yields well into the future; and  • Increases in fishing mortality above the current level, and/or unfavorable changes in environmental conditions, may result in recruitment levels that are insufficient to sustain the current productivity of the stock."
WCPFC5,90,"Although scientific advice regarding northern striped marlin was provided to the NC by the ISC, there has not yet been a recommendation by the SC that northern striped marlin is a northern stock, therefore no management advice was proposed."
WCPFC5,91,The NC noted the importance of ensuring that any reductions on fishing effort resulting from the CMM for bigeye and yellowfin tuna not be transferred to northern stocks.
WCPFC5,92,The NC expressed its support for amending the CMM for sharks (CMM 2006-05) to apply to all vessel sizes.   15    5.2 Issues from the NC4 Report
WCPFC5,93,"The NC Chair explained that Korea had entered a reservation to the management recommendation for Pacific bluefin tuna. The reasons for this reservation have been thoroughly explored with Korea, which has indicated it has no intention to increase its effort in 2009."
WCPFC5,94,"Korea stated that it is requesting a postponement, during which it will work to improve a statistical system on the northern Pacific bluefin tuna, study the distribution of Pacific bluefin in its coastal waters, and explore mechanisms for controlling effort given existing national laws and regulations."
WCPFC5,95,"Given Korea’s reservation, the Chair of the NC suggested that Commission Members may wish to implement the recommendation on a voluntary basis and report their efforts in this regard to NC5. The recommendation can be reconsidered by NC5 and potentially developed into a draft CMM to be considered at WCPFC6. In 2009, the Chair of the NC will meet with representatives of Mexico to begin a dialogue on cooperative Pacific bluefin tuna management."
WCPFC5,96,One CCM expressed concern that the management recommendation for Pacific bluefin:  i) is not adequately precautionary; ii) is premised on an assumption that environmental conditions remain favorable; and iii) does not define current effort.
WCPFC5,97,"Gary Sakagawa, Chair of the ISC, informed the Commission that the ISC is currently holding a workshop designed to clarify points of uncertainty in the Pacific bluefin stock assessment. More informative scientific advice is expected to be available for WCPFC6."
WCPFC5,98,"Two CCMs expressed their concerns about the status of the Pacific bluefin stock, urging the ISC and the NC to work toward a revised management recommendation next year."
WCPFC5,99,"WCPFC5 agreed that CCMs are requested not to increase the level of fishing mortality on Pacific bluefin in 2009 on a voluntary basis and tasked the NC to work toward developing a draft CMM for Pacific bluefin for consideration at WCPFC6.   5.3 Programme of work for the Northern Committee in 2009, 2010, 2011"
WCPFC5,100,"The NC Chair presented the NC work programme for 2009–2011, which outlines projects under four main headings: northern stocks; non-target, associated and dependent species; review of the effectiveness of decisions; and cooperation with other organizations (Report of the NC4, Attachment L)."
WCPFC5,101,"The Chair noted that an interim management objective for North Pacific albacore was established, which states that spawning stock biomass should be maintained above the level represented by the average of the lowest 10 years in the stock’s 40-year data history. The NC plans to consider the need for management action in 2009, and anticipates a new stock assessment from the ISC in 2010."
WCPFC5,102,The work programme for Pacific bluefin tuna is referred to in Section 5.2 above.  16
WCPFC5,103,A stock assessment for North Pacific swordfish is expected in 2009.
WCPFC5,104,One CCM expressed concern that the interim management objective for North Pacific albacore is not sufficiently precautionary. Clarification was requested as to how this objective relates to levels of un-fished biomass.
WCPFC5,105,Representatives of the NC and the ISC responded that the interim management objective is simply designed to prevent the stock from falling below its lowest documented levels. Work to develop more permanent fisheries management reference points is ongoing and will inform future evaluation of stock status and formulation of conservation and management recommendations.
WCPFC5,106,"The issue of the NC’s inability to propose a management measure for North Pacific striped marlin in the absence of its designation as a northern stock was raised. However, it was noted that a North Pacific striped marlin management recommendation was agreed on as part of the adoption of the report of SC4."
WCPFC5,107,WCPFC adopted the NC4 Summary Report.    AGENDA  ITEM  6  -  TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE 6.1 Report of the Fourth Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee
WCPFC5,108,"Wendell Sanford (Canada), Chair of the TCC, presented the outcomes of TCC4, which was held in Pohnpei, FSN, 2–7 October 2008. The following recommendations from the TCC4 Summary Report were adopted by the Commission:    a. TCC4 recommended to the Intersessional Working Group on the Regional Observer Programme (IWG-ROP) that crew nationality was not an essential data field, but that verification of fish hold capacity should be included as a data field for the ROP  (para 15);   b. TCC4 recommended that the Commission approve the collection of data listed in Attachment C to the TCC4 report (para 23).   c. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that the mandate of the IWG-ROP be extended for a period of one year (para 34). d. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that it authorize the IWG-ROP to continue its work on outstanding items contained in CMM 2006-07, a non-exhaustive list of which is attached at Attachment D to the TCC4 Summary Report (para 35).   e. TCC4 recommended that the Secretariats of the WCPFC and FFA enter into discussions with a view to preparing a draft VMS service level agreement for consideration by the Commission at WCPFC5 (para 40).   f. With respect to costs for the Commission VMS, TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that CCMs will assume costs for their vessels. Costs for Secretariat operations of the Commission VMS will be borne by the Commission budget (para 56).   g. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that the activation date for the WCPFC VMS be 1 April 2009 (para 58).    17 h. Regarding TCC4’s discussions of para 3(j) of CMM-2007-03, the majority favored retaining this paragraph while the minority favored its removal. CCMs agreed to recommend to the Commission not to apply para 3(j) of CMM-2007-03 as a criterion for IUU listing in developing the Draft IUU Vessel List in 2009. During this period, the Secretariat, in consultation with interested CCMs, will develop additional procedures to give effect to this paragraph for discussion at TCC5 (para 115).    i. TCC4 recommended participation of CCMs and the WCPFC Secretariat in the Second Meeting of International Tuna RFMOs (para 118).   j. TCC4 recommended consideration of IUU lists developed in other RFMOs as a criterion in the development of the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. In doing so, WCPFC should take into account the processes used within other RFMOs and characteristics of the area for IUU listing (para 119).  k. TCC4 noted that in the future, the development and implementation of a measure in this Commission might be required to sanction CCMs that frequently have their vessels nominated for IUU listing, especially if any CCM fails to effectively monitor, control and sanction offending vessels and vessel operators. Noting this point, TCC4 suggested that any potential measure should take into account actions taken to impose sanctions in other RFMOs. TCC4 recommended that this issue be taken up by the Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures (CCMM) Working Group facilitated by Australia (para 121–123).   l. TCC4 recommended that WCPFC5 agree that for the purpose of the High Seas Boarding and Inspection Procedures, CCMs shall provide to the Secretariat the contact information for the authorities of their fishing vessels (para 167).   m. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that the Secretariat, in consultation with CCMs, develop a web-based system for vessel record information (para 172).   n. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that the exemption for non-CCM carrier and bunker vessels be extended for a further year (para 175).    o. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that, depending on the response [of CCMs to a call to bring their reporting up to date in advance of WCPFC5] the Commission may wish to consider remedial action, including sanctions, for failure to comply (para 209).   p. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that [the TCC4] budget and work plan be approved (para 234).   q. TCC4 recommended deferral of the issue of port State measures for WCPFC until conclusion of the FAO process (para 246). r. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that it should clarify that with respect to the seabird CMM, different measures must be taken from each column [of CMM 2007-04, Table 1: Mitigation Measures (for seabirds)] when weighted branch lines are under consideration (para 275). s. TCC4 discussed the technical specifications for seabird mitigation measures provided as Attachment O, Annex 1 and recommended to WCPFC5 that further review of these specifications should take place at SC5 and TCC5, drawing on the most recent decision by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) on this matter (para 276)."
WCPFC5,109,"In response to a question regarding high seas boarding and inspection procedures, it was clarified that under para 6 of CMM 2006-08, these procedures apply between a Contracting Party and a Fishing Entity subject to a notification to that effect to the  18 Commission from the Contracting Party concerned. With regard to Chinese Taipei, the Secretariat reported receiving such notifications from New Zealand and Cook Islands."
WCPFC5,110,"Regarding the extension of the exemption for non-CCM carrier and bunker vessels for another year (item n above), FFA members stated that in some cases, such vessels are vital for continued operation of the fishery and that a more considered solution to this ongoing problem should be made a priority work item for TCC5."
WCPFC5,111,"It was noted that in order to be consistent with the respective roles and responsibilities of TCC4 and WCPFC5, the recommendation in paras 275 and 276 of the TCC4 report should read “recommended to WCPFC5”.  These changes have been incorporated into items r and s above.   6.2 VMS standards, specifications and procedures"
WCPFC5,112,"The Chair of the TCC presented the latest draft of the WCPFC VMS standards, specifications and procedures (SSPs) produced by TCC4 (WCPFC5-2008/16 Suppl.). Although the TCC4 draft was nearly complete, agreement was not reached on text in paras 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 7.3.6."
WCPFC5,113,"In response to comments from Chinese Taipei (WCPFC5-2008/DP-25) with respect to the application of procedures to contact vessels that fail to report at agreed intervals, it was agreed that the WCPFC Secretariat and the flag State will use all practical means, including radio from and to the flag State, to re-establish and maintain contact with the vessel in question."
WCPFC5,114,"In discussion of the text in para 5.3 of the SSPs, one CCM suggested that “before entry” be replaced with “upon entry” and “high seas of the” be inserted before “Convention Area is exited” in the second sentence."
WCPFC5,115,"Despite lengthy discussion, agreement on paras 5.4 and 5.5 of the SSPs could not be reached. CCMs’ views ranged from a desire to allow 30 days for re-establishing the functioning of a vessel’s automatic location communicator (ALC) with an 8-hour interim manual reporting interval in para 5.4 (15 days and 8 hours in para 5.5), to immediate return to port in the event of ALC malfunction with manual reporting every hour. Arguments were also made for a 10-day re-establishment limit with 4-hour manual reporting intervals. It was stated that other RFMOs have re-establishment limits of 30–60 days and that the FFA VMS requires manual reporting at 4-hour intervals."
WCPFC5,116,"It was observed that based on a minimum number of reporting vessels (e.g. 200 vessels), 216,000 polls would be expected per year, with the number of missed polls expected to be 21 given a failure rate of 1:10,000. A considerably larger number of missed polls during the initial months of Commission VMS operation will perhaps indicate a need to re-visit discussions surrounding the bracketed text in paras 5.4 and 5.5 of the SSPs."
WCPFC5,117,"In discussion of para 7.3.6 of the SSPs, one CCM considered that this text would be more appropriately placed in the Rules and Procedures for Protection, Access to and Dissemination of Data. It was agreed that this text would be considered for inclusion in the Rules and Procedures for Protection, Access to and Dissemination of Data but unless and until incorporated therein, the text should remain in the VMS SSPs.     19"
WCPFC5,118,WCPFC5 adopted the VMS SSPs produced by TCC4 with agreed amendments to paras 5.3 and 7.3.6. WCPFC5 recommended that CCMs work to resolve issues relating to bracketed text in paras 5.4 and 5.5 of the VMS SSPs prior to TCC5.   6.3 Draft FFA/WCPFC VMS Service Level Agreement
WCPFC5,119,"The Executive Director presented the draft Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the FFA and WCPFC Secretariats to support implementation of the VMS (WCPFC5-2008/16 Suppl., Attachment B).  This was prepared subsequent to discussions at TCC4 with the assistance of FFA.  WCPFC5’s attention was drawn to Schedule 2, which provides a description of services, and Schedule 3, which contains payments and charges. It was highlighted that selection of the Pacific VMS option by WCPFC4 avoids substantial capital costs. The current estimate of total costs per vessel per month is approximately US$ 28. Charges associated with Communication Service Providers (Iridium, Inmarsat-C, Argos) can not yet be precisely estimated. However, assuming that 150 vessels report directly to the Commission in the first year (plus an additional 450 vessels reporting through FFA); reporting every four hours at a cost of five cents per report; and polling once per week, costs will be on the order of US$ 15 per month. In addition, as the number of vessels reporting increases, reporting costs per vessel will decrease."
WCPFC5,120,"In response to questions, the Executive Director clarified that VMS data reported from vessels on the high seas will be directly transmitted to the Commission through the Pacific VMS Data Centre and will not pass through the FFA. Also, the US$ 1,250 fee to a CCM to access its own data through the system was confirmed to be a one-time charge."
WCPFC5,121,"Two CCMs questioned whether the assumed number of vessels reporting to the Commission’s VMS was realistic, as the number of vessels could possibly be substantially higher.  These CCMs recommended budgeting for a greater number of vessels reporting in the first year."
WCPFC5,122,It was noted that the number of vessels likely to be reporting is difficult to estimate.  Assuming a low number of vessels produces a worst-case per vessel cost estimate but under-estimating the number of vessels may result in under-estimating fixed costs.
WCPFC5,123,"One CCM inquired about the incremental cost to the Commission if vessels are already reporting to the FFA. The Executive Director replied that because the FFA will not pass on the charges from the Communication Services Provider, the incremental cost should be low."
WCPFC5,124,WCPFC5 accepted the estimates of the VMS cost structure and adopted the WCPFC-FFA VMS Service Level Agreement.   6.4 Issues from the TCC4 Summary Report
WCPFC5,125,It was noted that a number of additional items discussed at TCC4 will be taken up under other agenda items in this meeting.
WCPFC5,126,"The EC provided a report on progress with developing a WCPFC Catch Documentation Scheme for bigeye tuna. After raising the issue for discussion at WCPFC4, the EC attempted to progress a draft CMM intersessionally, and discussed the issue at TCC4. The EC committed to continuing their work on this issue in 2009,  20 including the possibility of convening an intersessional workshop, perhaps in conjunction with the IWG-ROP and/or the Ad Hoc Task Group–Data.   6.5 Annual Report by CCMs (Part 1 and Part 2 Reports)"
WCPFC5,127,"The Executive Director presented a paper summarizing CCMs submission of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Annual Report to the Commission (WCPFC5-2000/IP02 (Rev.1).  As of the date of this paper, 30 Part 1 reports had been submitted to the Secretariat. It is understood that information for the three participating territories who have not submitted Part 1 reports has been provided in the Part 1 reports submitted by the USA and France. As of the date of the paper, 28 Part 2 reports had been received and one report is outstanding. CCMs were urged to adhere to the deadlines for Part 1 and Part 2 reports as receipt of these reports during or after the SC or TCC meetings hinder compilation of the submissions by the Secretariat, and effectively prevent review of the reports by other CCMs. CCMs were invited to note the summary of outstanding submissions in WCPFC5-2008/IP06, Table 3, and submit any outstanding Part 1 and Part 2 information to the Secretariat."
WCPFC5,128,"The Executive Director also presented enhanced guidelines for CCMs’ Part 2 of the Annual Report (WCPFC5-2008/IP-07, Appendix B). An example submission using the new template is attached as Appendix C to that information paper."
WCPFC5,129,"In response to a question regarding a master list of reporting deadlines, the Executive Director drew CCMs’ attention to the ongoing improvements to the Commission’s website, which will include a page showing all reporting deadlines and CCMs’ submissions to date at a glance. The Chair suggested that the Executive Director provide a reminder to all CCMs regarding the website’s new functions."
WCPFC5,130,"One CCM suggested that in order to avoid showing failure to submit a nil response (e.g. no data submitted because no fishery operated) as non-compliance, that the Secretariat notify all parties via correspondence of any non-compliances and provide an opportunity to respond."
WCPFC5,131,"WCPFC5 agreed to accept the Secretariat’s report on CCMs’ Annual Report, Part 1 and 2 submissions and adopted the enhanced guidelines for Part 2 submissions contained in WCPFC5-2008/IP-07, Appendix B. CCMs should use these guidelines for all future submissions of Part 2 reports.   6.6 Review of CCMs’ implementation and compliance with CMMs"
WCPFC5,132,"In response to a request from TCC4, the Executive Director presented, in tabular form, the compliance of individual CCMs against more than 20 CMMs (WCPFC5-2008/IP06 [Rev.1]).  This paper incorporates feedback from CCMs in response to the initial version of the paper.  Another paper (WCPFC5-2008/18) provides a descriptive overview of CMM implementation and compliance similar to that presented to the Commission in previous years. The Executive Director, on behalf of the Commission, expressed appreciation for the work of SPC data managers who handle the Commission’s data."
WCPFC5,133,"Belize noted that although the papers show three instances of non-compliance by Belize, in fact all of these data have been submitted.     21"
WCPFC5,134,FSM also noted some discrepancies between its data holdings for longline catches of bigeye tuna and data held by SPC. FSM and SPC will work to resolve these issues.
WCPFC5,135,"In order to cope with the substantial time required to track compliance issues as the number of CMMs increases, New Zealand suggested that Secretariat staffing be augmented to include an additional compliance officer. New Zealand also supported the continued provision of information like that in WCPFC5-2008/IP06 (Rev.1) as it appears to be effective in prompting additional data submissions to the Secretariat."
WCPFC5,136,"WCPFC5 noted two papers (WCPFC5-2008/18 and WCPFC5-2008/IP06.Rev.1) evaluating the compliance of CCMs with the Commission’s CMMs.   6.7 Programme of work for the Technical and Compliance Committee in 2009, 2010 and 2011"
WCPFC5,137,"WCPFC5 discussed the proposed TCC work programme for 2009-2011 contained in the TCC4 Summary Report, Attachment M."
WCPFC5,138,"In discussion, the following items were identified as priorities for the coming year (2009):    a. Finalising and implementing the regional observer programme;  b. Developing a measure on transhipment; c. Revising procedures for granting CNM status; d. Improving / elaborating IUU listing procedures;  e. Developing a measure regarding control of nationals; f. Determining a more lasting solution to the issue of non-CCM flagged carriers and bunkers; g. Developing Port State measures pursuant to the outcome of the FAO consultations; h. Developing a Catch Documentation Scheme; i. Developing a Vessel Day Scheme for the high seas; j. Defining guidelines for chartering arrangements; k. Finalizing the Rules and Procedures for the Protection, Access to and Dissemination of Data; and l. Developing a process of monitoring compliance by CCMs."
WCPFC5,139,WPCFC5 adopted the TCC4 Summary Report   6.8 WCPFC IUU Vessel List
WCPFC5,140,"In October 2008, TCC4 agreed to include the Jing Chuen No. 68 on the Provisional IUU Vessel List, noting that the vessel shall be subsequently removed from the list once France confirms that the payment of assessed fines is complete (TCC4 Summary Report, paras 94–97).  France reported to WCPFC5 that the payment is now complete (WCPFC5-2008/IP08)."
WCPFC5,141,WCPFC5 agreed by consensus not to list the Jing Chuen No. 68 on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.     22
WCPFC5,142,"The other vessel on the 2008 Provisional IUU Vessel List prepared by TCC4 is the Chu Huai No. 638, a Chinese Taipei-flagged fishing vessel originally nominated for listing by Tonga (TCC Summary Report paras 65–73)."
WCPFC5,143,Tonga reported to WCPFC5 that the case had been satisfactorily settled and thanked representatives from Chinese Taipei for their assistance in this matter. Tonga reiterated the gravity with which it treats IUU fishing incidents in its national waters.
WCPFC5,144,WCPFC5 agreed by consensus not to list the Chu Huai No. 638 on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC5,145,"With regard to two vessels placed on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List at WCPFC4, the government of Venezuela requested the WCPFC5 remove the Athena F and Daniela F from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC5,146,"Cook Islands reported that subsequent to listing of the Athena F on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List in 2007, it had received helpful and responsive cooperation from the Venezuelan government, indicating that the vessel has been prosecuted under Venezuelan law and the vessel master has been prosecuted by the vessel owner. In Cook Islands view, the applied sanctions are adequate, and Cook Islands supported Venezuela’s request to remove the Athena F from the list.  Cook Islands noted that the WCPFC IUU Vessel List is a valuable tool in assisting coastal States with large EEZs to control IUU activities."
WCPFC5,147,WCPFC5 agreed by consensus to remove the Athena F from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC5,148,"Concerning the Daniela F, France stated it had been asked by Venezuela to provide additional documentation of the violation, and France had done so but there has been no further response from Venezuela. France considers that because:  a. the infringements by the Daniela F (i.e. fishing without a license and use of purse seine gear) are serious ones, which targeted small fish and had a high potential to damage coastal resources; b. the response from Venezuela to date is insufficient; and c. the case is currently proceeding through their national judicial system;   France does not support Venezuela’s request to remove the vessel from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC5,149,"WCPFC5 did not achieve consensus on removal of the Daniela F from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List, therefore this vessel shall remain on the list."
WCPFC5,150,"Regarding another vessel placed on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List by WCPFC4, TCC4 agreed to recommend to WCPFC5 the removal of Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List if a satisfactory settlement was reached by the time WCPFC5 met."
WCPFC5,151,"Chinese Taipei explained that it has suspended the vessel’s fishing license for one year, suspended the captain’s license for one year, and required the vessel to remain in port during the course of the investigation. It has also thoroughly investigated ownership issues and found no evidence that the existing owner of the vessel has any linkage with the owner of the vessel at the time of the violation. Chinese Taipei believes that these  23 actions satisfy two (sub-paras a–c and d) of the three criteria in CMM 2007-03 para 25, and that compliance with any one of these criteria (i.e. either sub-paras a–c, or d, or e) is sufficient to support removal of this vessel."
WCPFC5,152,"FSM informed WCPFC5 that the case of the Jinn Feng Tsair No 1 is pending in FSM’s Supreme Court, and unless negotiations between involved parties result in resolution before 1 January 2009, FSM will move for summary judgement. FSM reiterated its view of the seriousness of the case, in particular that the vessel fled FSM jurisdiction and has not responded to the action taken against it in FSM courts, and has failed to settle the case through mediation.  In this sense, FSM considers that the requirement to settle the case to the satisfaction of the CCM that originally submitted the vessel for listing under CMM 2007-03, para 25e has not been met.  FSM therefore maintains that the Jinn Feng Tsair No 1 should remain on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List until the vessel submits to FSM laws and regulations."
WCPFC5,153,WCPFC5 did not achieve consensus on removal of the Jinn Feng Tsair No 1 from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. Therefore this vessel shall remain on the list.
WCPFC5,154,"The WCPFC IUU Vessel List adopted at WCPFC5 is: a. Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1, and b. Daniela F"
WCPFC5,155,Chinese Taipei argued that a sanction of effective severity has been imposed upon Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 in accordance with CMM 2007-03. Chinese Taipei argued that there is ample evidence to prove that the previous owner has no current interest or connection with that vessel and thus the Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 should be removed from the current IUU List as a matter of law.
WCPFC5,156,"Some CCMs noted that the current IUU listing procedures (CMM 2007-03) require consensus for both listing and de-listing of vessels. It was further noted that such requirements are difficult to achieve since either the flag State of the vessel nominated for listing or the coastal State nominating the vessel can unilaterally block a consensus decision. For this reason, it was suggested that the Commission specify procedures that do not allow the flag or coastal States involved in the listing case to block a consensus of the remaining CCMs."
WCPFC5,157,"Several CCMs, including FFA members, stated the view that evaluating whether an effective action has been taken by a flag State, as required by CMM 2007-03 para.15(b), is a matter for consideration of the Commission, rather than just the flag State, and that it is important that the satisfaction of the coastal State be factored into making such considerations. These CCMs suggested that the following criteria should be considered when determining whether a satisfactory settlement has been reached.  a. The potential penalties imposed by the coastal State;  b. The number of violations committed;  c. The quantity, species and value of fish taken whilst the violations were being committed;  d. The potential loss of licensing revenue incurred;  e. The cost for carrying out monitoring, control and surveillance activities to detect the violation; f. The cost of the investigation of the IUU matter;  24 g. The ongoing cost of sending staff to WCPFC meetings to ensure that the vessel is placed on the IUU list; and h. The need to set a penalty that acts as an effective deterrent so as to secure compliance with coastal State laws and WCPFC measures."
WCPFC5,158,"Some CCMs advised against formalizing provisions for mandatory involvement of the flag State in settlements, warning that such provisions could lead to double punishment of the vessel.  It was also noted, however, that there are practical reasons why the flag State may be best placed to prosecute the vessel (e.g. when the vessel has fled the waters where the violation occurred)."
WCPFC5,159,"Other CCMs stated the importance of requiring a settlement that is satisfactory to the coastal State whose resources were damaged by the violation, and urged that coastal State settlement take priority over a settlement imposed by the flag State. These CCMs noted that it would be unfair for the flag State to benefit (e.g. receive fines) when its vessels engage in IUU fishing activities, yet the coastal State where the violation occurs receives nothing."
WCPFC5,160,"Some CCMs suggested that in the first instance, and unless extenuating circumstances exist, settlement of IUU fishing incidents between the offending vessel and the coastal State should be given precedence."
WCPFC5,161,"WCPFC5 agreed that further development of guidelines for how the Commission should consider and assess the adequacy of any actions taken, or sanctions imposed, in relation to CMM 2007-03 should be a priority work item and referred the matter to TCC5. It was noted that work on a control of national measures may inform this process.     AGENDA  ITEM  7  -  CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES 7.1 Bigeye and yellowfin a. Presentation from industry"
WCPFC5,162,"Michael McGowan (Bumble Bee Foods) made a presentation entitled “Market and Cannery Overview”. Global catch increased rapidly through the late 1990s but has since flattened out. Growth in global catch of tuna has been driven by catches in the WCPFC Statistical Area.  Estimates of world population growth will continue to place pressure on world fish supplies.  Even with aquaculture, supply will not be able to keep pace with demand. Increases in tuna supply have supported the development of a global market for canned tuna, with revenues estimated at about US$ 7.5 billion. Global processing tends to be aligned around key tuna fishing grounds near the equator. Tariff structures and labor rates are also key factors. There are about 56 tuna processing facilities that rely predominantly on the WCPFC fishery, and about 36 processing facilities that rely predominantly on the eastern Pacific fishery, with production at about one-half the WCPFC level. There are a smaller number of Indian Ocean processing facilities with annual production estimated at about 272,000 tons. Most of the Atlantic production capacity is in Spain and western Africa. Skipjack prices have shown a steady increase over recent years as demand has outpaced supply. Between January 2007 and March 2008, eastern Pacific prices were significantly above western Pacific prices, reflecting  25 fishery closures and a strong Euro. The effect of escalating skipjack prices is lower demand and a shift to higher quality, value added products. Going forward, skipjack prices are expected to remain firm as demand outpaces supply.  Sustainable fisheries management will be a key challenge.   b. Parties to the Nauru Agreement Report: Implementation of VDS"
WCPFC5,163,"The Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) presented a paper on implementing the VDS (WCPFC5-2008/25). As this is the first year of the scheme, issues with implementing it are expected to arise and will be handled in order to allow the VDS to operate effectively. Effort is being limited to 2004 levels according to CMM 2005-01, with a provision to allow transfer of days between PNA members. For these limits to be effective in reducing fishing mortality on the stocks, it will be important for the Commission to adopt compatible measures for high seas areas and other areas not covered by the Third Implementing Arrangement of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement."
WCPFC5,164,"Attention was also drawn to WCPFC5-2008/18 Attachment 1, Table 1, which presents a summary of purse-seine effort for individual PNA member countries, similar to tables presented previously but with a new format showing effort for individual PNA member countries, effort in archipelagic waters and effort by PNA domestic vessels."
WCPFC5,165,One CCM noted that the VDS is an important step in controlling overall fishing effort on bigeye tuna and expressed its intention to cooperate with PNA members on VDS implementation through bilateral agreements.    c. Compatibility: High Seas VDS
WCPFC5,166,"WCPFC4 tasked the Executive Director to commence a process to support the adoption of measures similar to the VDS to limit purse-seine effort on the high seas, consistent with para 9 of CMM 2005-01, and in waters under the national jurisdiction of non-PNA members of the Commission, consistent with para 10(ii) of CMM-2005-01. WCPFC5-2008/13 presents several options for managing purse-seine effort on the high seas, noting that access to the high seas pockets can be, and in some cases already is, controlled through EEZ access agreements with PNA members."
WCPFC5,167,FFA members noted their support for a high seas VDS and the establishment of compatible arrangements for controlling purse-seine effort. These members suggested that the issue be referred to SC5 and TCC5 for further consideration.
WCPFC5,168,The Commission agreed to refer the issue of a high seas VDS to SC5 and TCC5 for further discussion.
WCPFC5,169,The Commission encouraged CCMs to provide comments on the recommendations contained in WCPFC5-2008/13 to the Secretariat prior to SC5.
WCPFC5,170,The Commission agreed to designate the issue of a high seas VDS as a high priority issue for consideration at WCPFC6.    26  d. Draft CMM for bigeye and yellowfin
WCPFC5,171,"The Chair of the Commission introduced his draft measure for the conservation and management of bigeye and yellowfin tuna (WCPFC5-2008/DP-01), reiterating that he considered agreement on such a measure to be the top priority for WCPFC5. Many other CCMs also stated that this issue was their key concern for the meeting."
WCPFC5,172,"John Hampton (SPC-OFP) summarized the results of the 2008 stock assessment for WCPO bigeye tuna and 2007 stock assessment for yellowfin tuna, with respect to the evaluation of management options. The latest stock assessment for WCPO bigeye tuna (2008) indicates that overfishing is occurring and there is a possibility that the stock is overfished. Historically, catches have been dominated by the longline fishery but some juveniles are taken by purse-seine fisheries, particularly those on floating objects. The recommendations from SC4 are to reduce fishing mortality by 30%. In order to achieve this, reductions will be necessary across a range of fisheries.  While reducing fishing mortality by longlines will have the greatest effect, with the rapid increase in purse-seine fisheries, particularly in Indonesia and the Philippines, reductions will also be needed in purse-seine fisheries."
WCPFC5,173,"Regarding yellowfin tuna, John Hampton explained that the latest stock assessment (2007) indicates there is a possibility that the stock is being subject to overfishing but the probability that the stock is in an overfished state is low. Even though effort and efficiency have increased, catch levels have remained relatively constant since the early 1990s, signalling that a limit has probably been reached. Yellowfin spawning stock biomass depletion is attributed primarily to catches of small individuals by the domestic purse-seine fisheries (both associated and unassociated sets) in the Philippines and Indonesia. The impact of longline fisheries on yellowfin tuna is considered to be modest."
WCPFC5,174,"Martin Tsamenyi provided an introduction to WCPFC5’s consideration of compatibility issues. Article 8 of the Convention requires that “conservation and management measures established for the high seas and those adopted for areas under national jurisdiction shall be compatible in order to ensure conservation and management of highly migratory stocks in their entirety”. In his presentation, Tsamenyi considered that, because the term “areas under national jurisdiction” is not defined in the Convention or UNFSA, that the Rules of Treaty interpretation under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties may provide for this term to be  interpreted in several ways, including: i)  literally to include the EEZ, territorial sea, archipelagic waters and internal waters; and ii) in the context of the fisheries provisions under the 1982 Convention to refer only to the EEZ.  Tsamenyi noted that consistent with the objective to manage the stocks in their entirety, Commission Members are obliged to seek a cooperative approach to the requirement under the Convention for compatibility of measures between the high seas and areas under national jurisdiction. In the discussion that followed, it was apparent that there were many differences of view among Members as to how the term “areas under national jurisdiction” should be interpreted and applied with respect to implementation of the WCPF Convention. The issue will require further consideration and clarification among Members."
WCPFC5,175,"With the permission of the Chair, Japan made a presentation describing their port sampling programme for purse-seine landings. Because Japanese regulations prohibit transhipment at sea from purse seiners, almost all purse-seine catches are landed  27 domestically. Due to market requirements, all landed fish are sorted by species and size category. Japan believes that this situation represents an opportunity for purse-seine catch monitoring."
WCPFC5,176,"Extensive discussion of the proposed bigeye and yellowfin CMM continued throughout WCPFC5, resulting in the circulation of several new drafts by the Chair, with the assistance of Australia, information papers from the Science Services Provider, and delegation papers by CCMs. Major issues raised and debated by CCMs during these discussions included, inter alia: a. Relative reductions in fishing mortality in purse-seine versus longline fisheries, given that a balance was desirable but some CCMs considered that their purse-seine fisheries had a minimal effect on bigeye stocks; b. Whether the proposed measure would provide for measurable and credible conservation benefits, an equitable conservation burden among CCMs, effective implementation and monitoring, and an ability to evaluate and adjust controls; c. The potential for flexibility in implementation, for example, by area or time period, or the possibility to trade reductions between different fisheries under the same flag; d. The potential for phased implementation of the measure over the proposed three-year timeframe; e. Whether the measure as drafted was sufficiently precautionary given the SC’s recommendation to reduce fishing mortality for bigeye tuna by 30%, and whether it was likely to achieve the desired result; f. Whether explicit provisions should be included for yellowfin tuna or whether by achieving reductions in fishing mortality for bigeye, that yellowfin would necessarily benefit as well; g. Whether it would be more practical and effective to mandate a closure of fish aggregating device (FAD) fisheries or a total closure of all purse seine operations, and the duration and locations of such closures; h. The importance of clearly reflecting and maintaining the limits on fishing effort specified by CMM 2005-01;  i. The geographic applicability of the measures (i.e. their applicability to archipelagic waters and territorial seas, and to areas of the far western Pacific);   j. The desirability of closing the high seas pockets between the EEZs of PNA member States and the relationship between such a closure and the development of a high seas VDS; k. The potential to consider exemptions from the measures on the basis of economic impacts either to SIDS, other developing States or developed States;  l. Ways of avoiding displacement of effort to other areas during times of proposed closures; m. Necessary levels of observer coverage; n. Options for different management measures in 2009 and 2010–2011 (before and after the Third Implementation Arrangement for the Parties to the Nauru Agreement goes into effect on 1 January 2010);  o. The growing contrast between flag-based and zone-based catch and effort limits; and p.  The measures for the purse-seine, longline and other fisheries shall be reviewed annually to assess whether it would provide an equitable conservation burden among fisheries and to consider whether equitable  28 contributions to the Commission’s conservation goals are achieved by these fisheries."
WCPFC5,177, WCPFC5 adopted a conservation and management measure for bigeye and yellowfin tuna in the WCPO by consensus (Attachment R).
WCPFC5,178,"New Zealand and other FFA members requested that the meeting record clearly specify that SIDS are exempt from the effort limits imposed by CMM 2005-01, and there is no requirement on SIDS to submit development plans."
WCPFC5,179,"RMI asked that the meeting record reflect that Attachment F to the adopted CMM 2008-01 consists of provisional data, and will be revised through cooperative efforts between the Executive Director and CCMs."
WCPFC5,180,USA wanted the record to note that the effort limits referenced by the adopted CMM 2008-01 are found in Attachment F of CMM 2008-01 in the column labelled as “Av. 2001-04 or 2004*”.
WCPFC5,181,RMI requested that the following footnotes be added to Attachment B of CMM 2008-01:  a. “the column labelled as CMM 2005-01 does not take into account para 6 and footnote 1 of CMM 2005-01.”   b. “the column labelled as CMM 2006-01 does not take into account para 6 and footnote 1 of CMM 2005-01.”
WCPFC5,182," Japan asked that the meeting record reflect the fact that, pursuant to para 15 of the adopted CMM 2008-01, Japan has been identified by the Commission as having the capacity to implement a 10% reduction in purse-seine catches through Member-specific catch limits as an alternative to a high seas FAD closure. The Chair noted that, in order for this to happen, it was now incumbent upon Japan to submit the full details of its intended measures, 2001–2004 operational catch and effort data, and its port monitoring programme to the Commission by 31 January 2009, as required by para 16 of the CMM 2008-01."
WCPFC5,183,"Chinese Taipei indicated that the number of purse seiners in its fleet is 34 rather than 33 as shown in Schedule 7, Attachment C of Attachment R of CMM 2008-01."
WCPFC5,184,"Indonesia read a statement provided as Attachment S to this Summary Report emphazing the need for the Commission to incorporate needs for environmental services into its CMMs and to develop such mechanisms in order to ensure that the benefit of its application will be distributed in a fair and equitable manner, taking into consideration the special characteristics of the coastal State which provide a conducive and dynamic environment for juvenile tuna to grow.   7.2 Transhipment"
WCPFC5,185,"RMI summarized its progress on a draft CMM on transhipment (WCPFC5-2008/DP-02 (Rev 2). The objective of the draft measure presented is to allow transhipment on the high seas in cases where it would be impractical to conduct operations without transhipment. Under the draft measure, CCMs would make such determinations using guidelines developed by the Secretariat and approved by the  29 Commission, and these determinations would be reviewed by the Commission. Provisions for observer coverage, accounting for more stringent national laws, prohibition of transhipment at sea by purse-seine vessels unless exempted by the measures, and reporting requirements for transhipment outside of the Convention Area of WCPO-caught fish are also included in the draft measure."
WCPFC5,186,"During an initial discussion, some CCMs posed questions on the proposed measure, including WCPFC competency to require documentation of transhipment outside the Convention Area; the differing responsibilities of flag and chartering States; provisions for longline transhipment; the application of certain provisions of the measure only to those areas between 20oN and 20oS; and the relationship between this measure and port State controls. Some of these CCMs referred to transhipment procedures in other RFMOs, such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and IOTC, and cited the need for consistency."
WCPFC5,187,"Other CCMs expressed a preference for a total ban on high seas transhipments, citing the potential complexity of implementing and enforcing the proposed measure. It was noted that ICCAT recently adopted a total ban on at sea transhipment of bluefin tuna for both longliners and purse seiners."
WCPFC5,188,"One CCM highlighted the importance of elaborating procedures for controlling and/or sanctioning carrier vessels which may be facilitating IUU fishing, thereby addressing the issue in a vessel-specific manner."
WCPFC5,189,"The draft measure was further discussed in a small working group (SWG) led by the RMI.  However, after several sessions, this SWG remained unable to achieve consensus on aspects of the proposal that placed any restrictions on currently allowable transhipment activities. As a result, the agreed provisions of the measure were considered an insufficient basis for a new CMM."
WCPFC5,190,"Acknowledging that a CMM on transhipment had been one of the top priorities for this meeting, WCPFC5 requested RMI to continue to lead development of a draft CMM, based on the progress achieved at WCPFC5 (WCPFC5-2008/DP02 [Rev. 3], Attachment T) with the objective of discussing a new draft as a priority issue at TCC5."
WCPFC5,191,"As noted in para 108 (n) of this report, WCPFC5 extended the exemption for non-CCM carrier and bunker vessels for another year, however, it was agreed that it would be critical to adopt a transhipment measure at WCPFC6, as it would be unacceptable to further extend the exemption currently in place.   7.3 Cooperating Non-member application process"
WCPFC5,192,Sylvie LaPointe (Canada) presented a paper providing a draft measure concerning applications for CNM status designed to replace CMM 2004-02 (WCPFC5-2008/DP-03).  It was explained that the draft measure’s new features included:  four criteria for evaluating applications; a mechanism by which the recommendations from TCC’s review of the application are communicated to applicants to allow them to submit other information; a caution against contributing to overcapacity; provisions from the UNFSA for granting participatory rights; and an invitation for CNMs to make a financial contribution to the work of the Commission.     30
WCPFC5,193,"FFA members stated that while some CNM applicants have interpreted CMM 2004-02 to confer a right to become a full member, FFA members do not accept this interpretation. FFA members tabled a revised version of a draft measure (WCPFC5-2008/DP-03 [Rev.1])."
WCPFC5,194,"In response to a question, it was clarified that Canada’s draft measure did not include any special provisions for taking account of the beneficial owners of the CNM applicant’s flagged vessels."
WCPFC5,195,Some CCMs raised points regarding how to handle applicants which are actively fishing in the Convention Area versus those which have only historical fishing operations.
WCPFC5,196,Some CCMs stated that CNM applicants should not be held to a higher standard than those to which members are held.
WCPFC5,197,It was suggested that CNM applicants be asked to provide a statement agreeing to be subject to high seas boarding and inspection procedures in order to remove any doubt regarding whether these procedures apply to CNMs as well as Members. This point was incorporated into revised text.
WCPFC5,198,"As a result of further discussions outside of plenary sessions, Canada tabled a new version of the measure as WCPFC5-2008/DP03 (Rev 2)."
WCPFC5,199,WCPFC5 adopted WCPFC5-2008/DP03 (Rev 2) as a CMM governing the process of considering CNM applications from 2009 onward (Attachment U).
WCPFC5,200,"As a follow-on comment to adopt the measure, one CCM noted that the flowchart based on CMM 2004-02, developed by TCC4 (TCC4 Summary Report, Attachment I), and used at WCPFC5 to evaluate applications for CNM status, was helpful. It was therefore suggested that this type of flowchart be amended to reflect the processes contained in the new measure and incorporated into the measure itself."
WCPFC5,201,WCPFC5 agreed that incorporating a flowchart illustrating the process into the new measure on CNM applications would be useful and referred the matter to TCC5 for action.   7.4 Process for monitoring compliance
WCPFC5,202,"Australia presented a proposal (WCPFC5-2008/DP-09) for the development of a WCPFC scheme for monitoring compliance with CMMs. The paper, which was prepared in response to a recommendation to the Commission from TCC4 to develop a compliance monitoring scheme, includes objectives and a structure for the scheme; information, process and response components of the scheme; a comparison with current practices in other RFMOs; and draft terms of reference for a Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures (CCMM) Working Group.  Australia suggested that this issue be progressed intersessionally, using email and/or fax, with a goal of conducting a more developed discussion of the topic at TCC5."
WCPFC5,203,"Some CCMs, including FFA members, stressed the importance of holding CCMs accountable for their compliance records and for developing mechanisms to resolve non-compliance issues beyond that provided by the IUU Vessel Listing process. These CCMs thus strongly supported the formation of a CCMM working group.    31"
WCPFC5,204,Other CCMs were not comfortable with the terms of reference currently proposed for the group. Key concerns included the large amount of additional resources likely to be necessary to support the new working group as well as the potential for it to duplicate some of the work of the TCC.
WCPFC5,205,"Some CCMs also stressed the importance of having the Secretariat notify CMMs of non-compliances and allowing for a response before listing any CCM as non-compliant. It was therefore agreed that the WCPFC Secretariat, pending the adoption of a proper compliance review within the organization, through official correspondence, should notify CCMs of any instances of non-compliance requesting a swift follow up by the concerned CCM."
WCPFC5,206,There was some support expressed for developing a compliance process that not only provides for punitive measures but also includes incentives for compliance. It was noted that the latter will be particularly important to acknowledge incremental improvements in reporting and compliance by less developed CCMs.
WCPFC5,207,"Following up on an offer made at TCC4, New Zealand undertook to complete a legal analysis of issues associated with compliance with measures, and make this available to any inter-sessional working group convened to further consider the matter of compliance monitoring by mid-February."
WCPFC5,208,"Australia convened a small working group which discussed the terms of reference for the proposed CCMM working group, but did not reach consensus (WCPFC-2008/DP38)."
WCPFC5,209,WCPFC5 agreed that further discussions of the terms of reference for a CCMM working group would occur through electronic means with a view toward holding more focused discussions on the topic at TCC5.   7.5 SIDS’ aspirations
WCPFC5,210,RMI delivered a statement (Attachment V) to introduce and present WCPFC5-2008/DP-05 on the aspirations of SIDS. The paper states that there are recurring difficulties in the development of SIDS’ fishing fleets and that some Commission Members are not cooperating in the provision of development assistance. It also calls for a reduction in the sizes of fleets from distant water fishing nations fishing in the Convention Area in order to realize fishing capacity and allow SIDS development aspirations to be acknowledged and fulfilled. It was noted that the paper could be adopted as a Commission resolution.
WCPFC5,211,Several FFA members voiced strong support for the ideas contained in the paper and the presentation. A request was made to include discussion of how implementation of Commission CMMs is impacting SIDS development aspirations as a standing item on the Commission meeting’s agenda.
WCPFC5,212,"Some CCMs, speaking in support of the resolution, suggested that its scope could be broadened to include participating territories and other developing States.     32"
WCPFC5,213,"Another CCM, also speaking in support of the resolution, noted inconsistencies in the phrasing regarding compatible measures, and suggested that this phrasing be aligned with Article 8, para 1 of the Convention."
WCPFC5,214,"Some CCMs, while supportive of the ideas in the paper, were troubled by the proposal that by 2018, SIDS could account for 70% of all highly migratory fish caught in the Convention Area, since some of these CCMs also have traditional fisheries or aspirations in their coastal zones. In this regard, it was suggested that the reference to 70% catch in the “Convention Area” either be changed to the “FFA area” or to “a greater share of the benefit than currently realized”. It was also noted the provision as currently phrased would likely be difficult to implement by the Commission even though it could be recognized as an aspiration."
WCPFC5,215,"The text was subject to extensive discussions in a small working group convened by RMI, ultimately resulting in WCPFC5-2008/DP05 (Rev. 8)."
WCPFC5,216,WCPFC5 adopted the Resolution on Aspirations of Small Island Developing States and Territories (Attachment W).
WCPFC5,217,"The Chair noted his surprise that the intention of the decision in relation to the acquisition and construction of vessels in Chinese Taipei for RMI and Tuvalu raised at the Commission meeting in 2007 had not been resolved. In his brief remarks on the issue, the Chair made reference to the current situation involving procurement of purse-seine vessels from Chinese Taipei by developed CCMs, and the inability of developing CCMs, in particular SIDS, to do the same. The Chair further noted the clear lack of fairness and disproportionate burden associated with the current situation and the difficulties for SIDS to effectively develop their domestic fisheries. While it is not the intent of the 2007 decision to increase capacity in the fishery it is also not the intent to limit SIDS to have to purchase existing second hand capacity belonging to other CCMs for their domestic fisheries development.   7.6 Sea turtles"
WCPFC5,218,"USA presented a proposal for a CMM for sea turtles (WCPFC5-2008/DP08). It was noted that this proposal has been coordinated with the SC and TCC, and is supported by the results of scientific studies in the WCPO, but that there may remain some uncertainty about the specific mitigation measures required for shallow sets in longline fisheries by some CCMs."
WCPFC5,219,"One CCM supported adoption of the text as a CMM without the specified mitigation measures, citing scientific papers questioning the effectiveness of circle hooks in mitigating sea turtle bycatch. As these studies were unfamiliar to several CCMs, it was requested that they be made available to the meeting."
WCPFC5,220,"Most other CCMs supported adoption of the text, including the mitigation measures, but requesting further details on these measures, such as the specifications of the gear and bait, educational materials for fishermen, and the ability to submit a mitigation plan for SC and TCC review in lieu of the use of circle hooks or whole finfish as bait."
WCPFC5,221,"In response to a comment regarding its practicality, the requirement to report sightings of sea turtles to the relevant authority of each CCM was removed from the text.    33"
WCPFC5,222,"Consultation on the draft text continued in the margins of the meeting and in a small working group chaired by USA, resulting in a revised draft measure (WCPFC5-2008/DP08 (Rev 2). This revision addressed three key points of concern as follows:  a. For shallow-set swordfish fisheries, providing for the use of any other measure, for submission of a mitigation plan or activity capable of reducing sea turtle interactions, that has been reviewed by SC and TCC and approved by the Commission, in lieu of the use of circle hooks or whole finfish for bait; b. For shallow-set swordfish fisheries, providing an exemption from the use of circle hooks, live bait or provision of mitigation plan if the SC determines such fisheries have a minimal observed sea turtle interaction rate over a three-year period (to be determined by SC5), and at least 10% observer coverage during each of those three years; c. Inclusion of a statement clarifying that nothing in the measure prejudices the sovereign rights of coastal States including the right to pursue traditional fishing activities."
WCPFC5,223,"WCPFC5 adopted the text of WCPFC5-2008/DP08 (Rev 2) as a CMM for sea turtles, noting that a definition of “minimal” observed interaction rates of sea turtles (para 7b) is to be determined by SC5 (Attachment X) ."
WCPFC5,224,"After adoption of the measure, the EC clarified its position on sea turtles and circle hooks for the record. The EC remains unconvinced of the effectiveness of circle hooks in reducing sea turtle interactions, citing a lack of scientific evidence. For this reason, the EC does not consider that the adoption of this CMM for sea turtles should set any precedent for similar measures in other RFMOs."
WCPFC5,225,"Other CCMs expressed their disagreement with this position, stating that there is ample scientific evidence of the effectiveness of circle hooks in the WCPO, and that such evidence has been reviewed by the SC and TCC, both of which recommend their use."
WCPFC5,226,"Australia made an additional point regarding the procedures for exercising the provisions in para 7.a.iii of the measure regarding mitigation plans. While Australia fully supports the intent of the measure and welcomes its prompt implementation on 1 January 2010, it noted with concern that this date is only a few weeks after the close of WCPFC6. Therefore, if changes are required to a mitigation plan presented by Australia to WCPFC6, Australia requested a grace period of six months to address practical issues involved in implementation before achieving full compliance.   7.7 Driftnets"
WCPFC5,227,"The USA introduced a draft CMM prohibiting the use of large-scale driftnets on the high seas in the WCPF Convention Area (WCPFC5-2008/IP-07). It was noted that such gear is subject to a global moratorium on the high seas, and that its use may undermine the Commission’s CMMs."
WCPFC5,228,"In response to a comment on the draft, it was agreed to remove the phrase “within areas under their national jurisdiction” so as to allow for a potentially broader application of more stringent measures by CCMs, such as those already in place to implement the Wellington Convention.    34"
WCPFC5,229,"The Commission encouraged NC5 to begin establishing a cooperative framework with the North Pacific Anadromous Fisheries Commission (NPAFC) and initiate, as soon as possible, a process to exchange information on North Pacific large-scale driftnet fishing activities between NPAFC and WCPFC members."
WCPFC5,230,WCPFC5 adopted WCPFC5-2008/IP07 (Rev. 1) as a new CMM restricting the possession of large-scale driftnets and prohibiting their use on the high seas of the Convention Area (Attachment Y).   7.8   Swordfish
WCPFC5,231," New Zealand introduced a draft measure (WCPFC5-2008/DP-04) designed to replace CMM 2006-03 for swordfish. The draft measure is based on the results of a stock assessment undertaken for swordfish in the southwest Pacific, and presented to SC4. Although the assessment did not indicate that overfishing is occurring or that the stock is in an overfished state, there was considerable uncertainty in the assessment due to data quality concerns. In addition, although CMM 2006-03 sets limits on vessel numbers, it does not restrict catch or effort, and has failed to control fishing mortality. For this reason, the draft measure incorporates the recommendations from SC4 that there be no further increase in catch or effort by limiting catches in 2009 to the maximum amount caught in any one year from 2000–2006. The measure is designed to be reviewed by WCPFC6."
WCPFC5,232,"Some Members considered that the assessment did not indicate any problem with the stock, since the stock was neither overfished nor in an overfished state. In addition, one CCM considered there was a need to ensure that the WCPFC is consistent in its management approach towards the different stocks, noting that there were tuna stocks in the WCPFC Convention Area, which were considered to be in a worse condition than the swordfish stock but for which no longline measure unfortunately was envisaged. It would therefore be unfair if additional measures would be imposed on some fleets while less restrictive measures would apply to other fleets. For those reasons, it was considered and that the current measures in place (CMM 2006-03) could be rolled over in its present format unless effective longline measures were also introduced for the stocks considered to be in a worse condition than the swordfish stock. Other developing States and participating territory CCMs expressed concerns about a rapid increase in effort and catch in the southwest Pacific swordfish which may adversely impact their development aspirations in the fishery."
WCPFC5,233,One CCM stated that the fact that a stock was not determined to be overfished or subject to overfishing was not a suitable basis for taking no management action. They noted that the objective of the Commission is for the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fish stocks and that this requires that management action is taken before stocks are overfished and is consistent with good fisheries management and the precautionary approach.
WCPFC5,234,One CCM also expressed concerns that catch limits could lead to greater discard rates.  That CCM also considered that the proposal to place a disproportionate burden on their fishing activities compared to other CCMs with high catches in earlier years would not lead to any effective catch restriction of the activities of these fleets. This was because these fleets had since restructured and reduced. Their suggestion was to continue to apply CMM 2006-03 while working to improve data and revisiting the measure in  35 2009. This CCM noted that it had faithfully maintained the vessel limits imposed by CMM 2006-03.
WCPFC5,235,"In discussions of the draft measure held in small working group sessions and otherwise in the margins of WCPFC5, it was learned that one of the CCMs fishing in this area, which is responsible for the majority of the catch, has revised its catch estimates for 2005 to be two to four times higher than the catches used in the stock assessment. According to data provided by that CCM to the Busan meeting, its catch figures for that given year were considerably higher than those figures that were available to SPC. On this basis it was also considered that the spatial extent of the stock assessment (it had been confined to the southwest Pacific) might have been able to be extended toward the EPO if better data from this CCM had been forthcoming in advance of the assessment."
WCPFC5,236,"Most CCMs believed this situation cast doubt on the stock assessment results and created an urgent need to verify the data provided by this CCM. Despite the increased uncertainty, these CCMs still believed it was necessary to limit fishing mortality on the stock due to increasing catches, reported targeting of sharks and high reported interactions with sea turtles and vulnerable seabird species such as albatrosses, in this fishery. Some of these CCMs, including SIDS such as Niue, and the participating territory, French Polynesia, expressed a strong desire for conservation and management of the stock in order to support their future development aspirations."
WCPFC5,237,"There was considerable discussion regarding the appropriate means of verifying the catch data of the CCM in question. Most CCMs stated that the original logbook and VMS data would be needed to verify the catch figures. However, the CCM responsible for reporting the data stated that such data could not be provided under its national data confidentiality policy. Several options were proposed, including the hiring of an independent reviewer to inspect the data in situ (e.g. in the lab where it is held), requesting SPC to review data or releasing data under a special data confidentiality agreement. In all cases, the CCM was still unable to guarantee that the original data could be made available."
WCPFC5,238,"While willing to submit all the necessary data required by WCPFC, 1  and pursuant to national legislation2 for verification of South Pacific swordfish catch data for 2005, this CCM also stated its view that the verification process, as proposed, was excessive, disproportionate and punitive."
WCPFC5,239,"A revised draft of the swordfish measure was tabled as WCPFC5-2008/DP04 (Rev. 1), and debate on this draft continued until the close of the meeting. In discussion of this draft, it was agreed that Annex 1 should be replaced with the original Annex 1 from WCPFC5-2008/DP04, with the addition of the annotation “bycatch” under the New Caledonia heading."
WCPFC5,240,"The CCM whose data requires verification maintained that data confidentiality rules would prevent it from sharing original logsheets and VMS records and thus it could not accept para 5 as drafted in WCPFC5-2008/DP04 (Rev. 1). Nevertheless, this CCM reiterated its willingness to submit to data verification for 2005 swordfish catch data only,                                                  1   Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission and data and information associated with CMMs and other decisions of the Commission.  2  See paragraph 64 above.    36 and agreed to provide all relevant data, including bycatch and observer reports, which can be released under its national legislation. This CCM agreed to use of the term “operational data” to characterize the nature of such data."
WCPFC5,241,"The Commission agreed that in order to reconcile significant changes in catch of swordfish south of 20°S by swordfish vessels reported to the Commission, all operational level catch and effort data, including bycatch data, for swordfish vessels flagged to the relevant CCM, shall be subject to a catch verification review funded by the CCM to whom the data relates, and carried out in 2009. The verification review will be undertaken by SPC-OFP in cooperation with the flag State’s relevant authority and in accordance with national legislation regarding confidentiality. The results of the verification review shall be reported to the SC and TCC, and taken into account by the Commission in determining any future catch limits."
WCPFC5,242,"WCPFC5 adopted the new CMM for swordfish, contained in WCPFC5-2008/DP04 (Rev. 1) as amended (Attachment Z).     7.8 Sharks"
WCPFC5,243,"The USA presented a draft CMM (WCPFC5-2008/IP06) designed to replace CMM 2006-05 on sharks. This new measure is based on the findings of SC4, which re-affirmed the shark fin to carcass ratio of 5%, and substantiated the lack of a difference in shark catches by vessels greater than and less than 24 meters in length. New elements of the measure include reference to the FAO International Plan of Action – Sharks (IPOA-Sharks); the identification of key shark species; assistance to SIDS for data collection and implementation of the IPOA-Sharks; reporting on implementation of the CMM in CCMs’ Annual Reports to the Commission; cooperation with IATTC on shark stock status; application of the measure to all vessels regardless of size; and reflection of concerns about artisanal and subsistence fisheries."
WCPFC5,244,One CCM asked that more specific guidance be provided on which part of the Annual Report should be used to report shark data.
WCPFC5,245,"PNG, on behalf of FFA members, spoke in favor of the measure, but requested more explicit references to traditional fishing activities and asked that references to the “WCPFC Convention Area” be modified to read “high seas and EEZs”.  PNG also suggested that blue, shortfin mako, oceanic whitetip and thresher sharks be explicitly listed as key shark species. This CCM also called for a shark stock assessment in 2010 and noted that it is the only country with a commercial shark fishery operating in its EEZ under a shark management plan."
WCPFC5,246,"Amendments to the text of the measure were made in response to PNG’s concerns. In particular, text pertaining to sovereign rights and traditional fisheries, which was included in the shark CMM, was identical to that included in the sea turtle CMM. The desirability of making use of consistent language with regard to these issues throughout Commission documents was noted."
WCPFC5,247,"WCPFC5 adopted the text of WCPFC5-2008/DP06 (Rev. 3) as a CMM for sharks, replacing CMM 2006-05 (Attachment AA).     37"
WCPFC5,248,"The USA noted for the record that the new reporting requirements for sharks contained in para 4 of the new measure will require modification of existing data forms and protocols, and thus may require time to implement.   AGENDA  ITEM  8  -  INTERSESSIONAL WORKING GROUP — REGIONAL OBSERVER PROGRAMME"
WCPFC5,249,"The Chair of the Intersessional Working Group – Regional Observer Programme (Charles Karnella, USA) presented the results of the work of the second meeting of the IWG-ROP (WCPFC5-2008/16), which  was held from 7–10 July 2008 in Nadi, Fiji. At IWG-ROP2, there was a consensus on 11 interim minimum standards covering: Data Fields; Observer Guides and Manual; Observer Training; Code of Conduct; Safety; ROP National Coordinators; Briefing and Debriefing; Equipment and Materials; Communications; Measuring Performance; and Dispute Settlement. During the year, IWG-ROP2 also reached agreement on an authorization process for national observers; the role and function of audits; data fields to be collected by observers; and data management."
WCPFC5,250,"TCC4 recommended to the Commission that the work of the IWG-ROP be extended for another year in order to progress work on priority issues, which include definition of terms; costs; the minimum size of vessels that can accommodate an observer; and vessel and observer safety.  There is also a substantial list of other issues that require further discussion."
WCPFC5,251,"The Chair of the IWG-ROP requested that, in accordance with previous agreements, CCMs submit all relevant data pertaining to existing national, sub-regional and regional observer programmes to the Secretariat."
WCPFC5,252,"WCPFC5 adopted the contents of the IWG-ROP2 Summary Report, encouraging CCMs-to continue to discuss outstanding ROP issues, as provided for in CMM 2007-01 (Attachment K, Annex C) intersessionally."
WCPFC5,253,WCPFC5 extended the mandate of the IWG-ROP for an additional one-year period to continue to progress the priority work items identified [at para 248 above and in the report of the second meeting of the IWG-ROP.
WCPFC5,254,"WCPFC5 agreed that the Third IWG-ROP meeting will be held in Guam, USA, from 16–20 June 2009.3    AGENDA  ITEM  9  -  RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE PROTECTION, ACCESS TO AND DISSEMINATION OF DATA"
WCPFC5,255,"The Chair of the Ad Hoc Task Group–Data (Holly Koehler, USA) presented outcomes from the work of this Task Group in 2008 (WCPFC5-2008/17). The primary focus of the Task Group has been to work toward finalization of the “Rules and                                                  3  Post script added by the Secretariat: Following WCPFC5 at Busan it was suggested that, because of the impending need for ROP observers for the closure starting 1 August 2009, an IWG-ROP3 meeting should be convened earlier in the year. Taking advantage of the annual consultation between the USA and FFA members scheduled for Palau in March, it has been suggested that IWG ROP3 meet in Guam from 18–21 March. As proposed at WCPFC5, it is suggested that the Ad Hoc Task Group–Data then convene 23 and 24 March.    38 Procedures for the Protection, Access to and Dissemination of Non-Public Domain Data and Information Compiled by the Commission for the Purpose of Compliance and Enforcement Activities on the High Seas and Scientific Purposes”. The Chair noted these Rules and Procedures contain detailed, special provisions governing the use of VMS data."
WCPFC5,256,"The latest draft of the Rules and Procedures was circulated on 14 November 2008.  Remaining issues are expected to centre on VMS issues, including linkages with the VMS SSPs.  As it was considered impractical to attempt to finalize the draft at WCPFC5, a timetable was set by which CCMs would comment on the latest draft by mid-February 2009. The Task Group envisages working electronically during part of 2009 but it was stressed by the Chair that one or two face-to-face meetings during 2009 would be necessary to finalize the draft ROPs. It was suggested that such possible meetings could be held in conjunction with another WCPFC body (e.g. IWG-ROP3 or SC5) in order to have a well developed draft of the Rules and Procedures available for discussion at TCC5, which could then be submitted for consideration and adoption at WCPFC6."
WCPFC5,257,"One CCM queried whether the existing draft Rules and Procedures provide for data that are not required to be submitted to the Commission but which are submitted on a voluntary basis (e.g. scientific data collected by coastal States). Specifically, it was queried whether there could be a provision by which the submitting coastal State could place greater restrictions on the dissemination of voluntarily provided data, as opposed to data that are required to be submitted to the Commission."
WCPFC5,258,Another CCM stressed the importance of appropriately balancing the rights and responsibilities of data providers and data users. This CCM also considered that an additional section covering sanctions for inappropriate use or unauthorised release of data should be incorporated into the draft.
WCPFC5,259,"WCPFC5 recommended that the Ad Hoc Task Group–Data, request comments on the latest draft of the Rules and Procedures by mid-February 2009, and work electronically, and potentially meet in conjunction with IWG-ROP3 or SC5, to produce a final draft Rules and Procedures document for discussion at TCC5, with a view that such ROPs be submitted for consideration and adoption at WCPFC6.    AGENDA  ITEM  10  -  ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS 10.1 Annual Report on the Commission’s work"
WCPFC5,260,"The Executive Director presented the Annual Report on the Commission’s work Commission (WCPFC5-2008/21), including its six subsidiary bodies (i.e. SC, TCC, NC, IWG-ROP, AHTG–Data, and the VMS Technical Working Group). The report also covered Secretariat activities, relationships with other organizations, emerging issues and acknowledgements.  Occupation of the new headquarters building in Kolonia, Pohnpei, was cited as one of the highlights of 2008."
WCPFC5,261,The Chair acknowledged the volume and quality of work produced by the Secretariat in the past year and thanked the Executive Director for his productivity and commitment.     39 AGENDA  ITEM  11  -  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES
WCPFC5,262,"The Chair noted that the current balance of the Special Requirements Fund stands at US$ 140,000."
WCPFC5,263,"Tokelau, on behalf of FFA, expressed appreciation to the USA for contributions to the Fund, and to Japan for contributions to the Japan Trust Fund in fulfilment of Part VIII of the Convention, which requires creation and disbursement of the Fund to support the development of capacity to manage fish stocks by developing States in the region."
WCPFC5,264,"Another FFA member stressed the importance of cooperation of Commission Members on a wide range of fronts, including not only the Special Requirements Fund, but also the development of equitable and compatible management measures and issues of vessel provision and licensing."
WCPFC5,265,The Chair noted that the issue of the provision of vessels by Chinese Taipei to RMI and Tuvalu was also discussed under a separate agenda item (Agenda Item 7.5).    AGENDA  ITEM  12  -  COOPERATION WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS
WCPFC5,266,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC5-2008/24 (Rev. 1), detailing activities of the Commission with regard to other organisations. The revision to the paper was necessary to reflect recent developments concerning an MOU between WCPFC and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Key issues raised for CCMs’ consideration included:    a. A recommendation that the Commission enter into three-year agreements with SPC as the Science Services Provider, as recommended in the recent review of the Commission’s science structure and function;  b. Review, amend as necessary, and consider for adoption or otherwise, the proposed memorandum of understanding (MOU) with CCAMLR; c. Revise, if necessary, the existing MOU between WCPFC and ISC in order to allow the SC to directly request advice from ISC on the status of North Pacific stocks; d. Consider establishing a formal relationship with the NPAFC; and  e. Review, amend as necessary, and endorse the proposed data exchange agreement with SPC."
WCPFC5,267,Japan queried whether the automatic provision of WCPFC data supplied by Japan to SPC will still allow Japan to access the data from SPC even though it is not a member of SPC.
WCPFC5,268,John Hampton (SPC-OFP) replied that access by CCMs to SPC data is covered by para5 of the existing data Rules and Procedures.
WCPFC5,269,"In response to a query regarding whether aggregated catch data would reflect the three vessel rule (i.e. data must be aggregated in a manner that no fewer than three vessels are represented in each data point), the Executive Director clarified that the three vessel rule is protected under the Commission’s Rules and Procedures for data.     40"
WCPFC5,270,One CCM thanked the Secretariat for their impressive and diligent work on formalizing arrangements with other organizations.
WCPFC5,271,WCPFC5 adopted the recommendations to enter into a three-year arrangement with SPC as the Science Services Provider; adopt the MOU with CCAMLR; revisit the MOU with ISC; begin work to establish a formal relationship with NPAFC; and adopt the Data Exchange Agreement with SPC.    AGENDA  ITEM  13  -  2009 WORK PROGRAMME PRIORITIES

Consider means to avoid annual extension of the waiver for non-CCM flag carrier and bunkers; f. Adopt a CMM to monitor and regulate transhipment activities; g. Further work on a high seas VDS; h. Develop a proposal for the control of nationals; i. Further develop the process for monitoring compliance; and j. Develop a charter arrangements scheme for consideration at WCPFC6.  AGENDA  ITEM  14  -  REPORT OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE
WCPFC5,273,"The Co-Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC), Tapusalaia Terry Toomata (Samoa), presented the Committee’s report to WCPFC5 (WCPFC5-2008/22). Highlights of the report included an agreement to re-appoint the Executive Director for a new four-year term beginning September 2009, and setting a timetable for developing a draft strategic plan for the Commission. It was reported that Toomata and Liu Xiaobing (China) were elected Co-Chairs of the FAC for 2009–2010. Dean Swanson (USA) was thanked for his efforts as Co-Chair over the past two years."
WCPFC5,274,"The generous contribution by PNG of US$ 100,000 of furnishings for the Commission headquarters building in Pohnpei, was gratefully acknowledged. Appreciation was also expressed to RMI for a contribution of artefacts to the Commission."
WCPFC5,275,"The FAC Chair noted that two additional items need to be incorporated into the Commission’s budget:    a. An allowance of US$ 20,000 to support the participation of the Commission Chair at TCC5 and WCPFC6; b. Provision for an additional compliance officer position as suggested by CCMs at WCPFC5.     41"
WCPFC5,276,"WCPFC5 adopted the recommendations of the FAC with regard to the assessment and expenditure of contributions for 2009, and an indicative budget for 2010 and 2011 as contained in WCPFC5-2008/22 (Attachment BB)   AGENDA  ITEM  15  -  WORK PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2009 AND INDICATIVE WORK PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2010 AND 2011"
WCPFC5,277,"The 2009 work programme and budget and indicative budgets for 2010 and 2011, as recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee, were adopted by the Commission. AGENDA  ITEM  16  -  ELECTION OF OFFICERS"
WCPFC5,278,"The Commission agreed by consensus to elect Ambassador Satya Nandan (Fiji) as Chair of the Commission for a term of two years. At the expiry of this term, non-FFA States will provide a candidate or candidates for the position of Chair for the consideration of the Commission."
WCPFC5,279,"Ambassador Nandan made a brief statement expressing appreciation to CCMs for allowing his candidacy to go forward. He congratulated Chair Hurry for his wise leadership and guidance in establishing both foundations for effective management and a strong spirit of cooperation in the Commission over the past five years, and expressed his hope that the same level of cooperation will be realized in the coming years."
WCPFC5,280,"Sylvie LaPointe (Canada) was elected, by consensus, to serve as Vice-Chair of the Commission for a term of two years. The efforts of outgoing Vice-Chair, Liu Xiaobing, were acknowledged with appreciation."
WCPFC5,281,Naozumi Miyabe (Japan) was elected by consensus to be the new Chair of the Scientific Committee.
WCPFC5,282,"Masanori Miyahara (Japan) was re-elected as Chair, and Benjamin Tabios was re-elected as Vice-Chair, of the Northern Committee.   AGENDA  ITEM  17  -  OTHER MATTERS 17.1 Performance review"
WCPFC5,283,"The Commission Chair introduced the topic of an independent performance review for the Commission, indicating that it would require approximately US$ 100,000 of funding but that this amount has not been provided for in the 2009 budget. Therefore, the earliest the review could take place would be 2010."
WCPFC5,284,Some CCMs stated that conducting the review in 2010 would be preferable since many of the Commission’s CMMs are relatively new.
WCPFC5,285,"Other CCMs, including FFA members, considered that the review should take place as soon as possible. These CCMs referred to a paper (WCPFC4-2007/DP05) prepared by Australia for WCPFC4 in 2007, which can be used a basis for scoping the review.    42"
WCPFC5,286,WCPFC5 agreed that a WCPFC4 paper prepared by Australia be used as basis for TCC5 to develop recommendations for a structure and budget so that an independent performance review of the Commission can be conducted in 2010. 17.2 Second meeting of Tuna RFMOs
WCPFC5,287,"WCPFC5 noted that the second meeting of Tuna RFMOs is scheduled for mid-2009 in Europe, and encouraged the active and constructive participation of CCMs and the Secretariat.   AGENDA  ITEM  18  -  CLOSE OF MEETING"

WCPFC6,16,"New Zealand, as the depository of the Convention, reported that no instrument of ratification, or accession to, the Convention had been received since WCFPC5 (WCPFC6-2009/07)."
WCPFC6,17,"  The EU advised that as a result of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in early December 2009, its delegation would henceforth be referred to as ―European Union‖ and not ―European Community‖ as previously advised. The EU will notify this change shortly to the WCPFC Secretariat by means of an official correspondence."
WCPFC6,18,  Samoa requested correction of the misprint in the annex to WCPFC6-2009/07 regarding its signature and ratification dates.
WCPFC6,19,New Zealand agreed to look into these issues and report back to the Commission.   2.2 Applications for observer status
WCPFC6,20,"The Executive Director advised that one new request for observer status was received (from the Pew Charitable Trust; WCPFC6-2009/08 [Rev. 1]) in accordance with the Rules of Procedure (Rule 36), and an additional late request was received from The World Bank. While there was no objection to either group being granted observer status, the Executive Director noted that several Members, participating Territories, and Cooperating Non-members (CCMs) had stated that, in future, applicants for observer status should comply with all Commission rules and procedures."
WCPFC6,21,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, reiterated the above issue and suggested that the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC) consider whether there are any costs to the Commission associated with the participation of observers. The FAC was invited to advise the Commission on the appropriateness and, if necessary, the level of observer registration fees in recognition of the growing number of observers and the costs incurred in catering for them at Commission meetings.   2.3 Applications for cooperating non-member status"
WCPFC6,22,"Applications for cooperating non-member (CNM) status, including applications for renewal of status by Indonesia, Belize, El Salvador, Mexico and Senegal, and new applications for CNM status from Ecuador and Vietnam, were considered by the Fifth Technical Compliance Committee meeting (TCC5) in accordance with procedures specified in CMM 2008-02. The Chair of the TCC, Ambassador Wendell Sanford (Canada), noted that none of the applicants had initially provided all of the required information, and that missing information had been requested via correspondence from the Executive Director (WPCFC-2009/09 [Rev. 1]). The TCC Chair noted that future applicants should be sure to check their submissions against the requirements of CMM 2008-02, thereby expediting TCC‘s work in processing applications."
WCPFC6,23,"WCPFC6 noted that in the past, participatory rights were granted based, in part, on voluntary undertakings by CNMs in relation to conservation and management measures (CMMs) and other Commission decisions that were adopted by the Commission at the time CNM status 4  was conferred. The Secretariat prepared a paper (WCPFC6-2009/09 Suppl.) on previous Commission decisions regarding CNMs‘ participatory rights."
WCPFC6,24,"In accordance with the requirement of CMM 2008-02 for the Commission to determine participatory rights for CNMs once CNM status is approved, New Zealand convened a small working group and submitted WCPFC6-2009/28, proposing specific participatory rights for each CNM in 2010."
WCPFC6,25,Several members stressed that CNM status should not be seen as a stepping stone to full membership.
WCPFC6,26,"Papua New Guinea and the Philippines stated that the wording of WCPFC6-2009/28 should not be taken as a precedent for the Commission‘s right to limit fishing activities in archipelagic waters, or to grant national allocations of fishing effort or national limits on catch.  These CCMs also noted with concern that text relating to limits on the number of fishing days, in combination with closing high seas areas (e.g. the two high seas pockets to purse-seine vessels under CMM 2008-01), could lead to an undesirable redistribution of purse-seine fishing effort to the central and eastern areas of the Convention Area.    Belize"
WCPFC6,27,"WCPFC6 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Belize with the following participatory rights:   Catches of bigeye tuna from Belize are limited to 803.25 mt, its average catch levels over the period of 2001–2004; catches of yellowfin tuna are limited to 2,000 mt; and its fishing activities are limited to: a. Under CMM 2005-02 in accordance with paragraph 1, Belize is limited to historical catch level for 2004 of two unique longliners in the Convention Area south of 20 degrees south latitude; b. Under CMM 2005-03 Belize is limited to the 2005 level of five unique longliners in the Convention Area north of the equator; and  c. Under CMM 2006-04, Belize is limited to two unique longliners in the Convention Area south of 15 degrees south latitude.  El Salvador"
WCPFC6,28,"WCPFC6 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by El Salvador with the following participatory rights:  El Salvador‘s fishing activities are limited to four unique purse-seine vessels in the Convention Area fishing in the EEZs of WCPFC Members subject to those vessels being placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV) and such opportunities becoming available. WCPFC6 agreed that in addition, under CMM 2008-01, El Salvador‘s fishing on the high seas in the Convention Area is limited to 29 days of fishing.       5  Indonesia"
WCPFC6,29,"WCPFC6 noted both the long history of Indonesia‘s involvement in the work of the WCPF Convention and the urgent need for further engagement of Indonesia in the work of the Commission, including, in particular, data provision and control of Indonesian-flagged vessels."
WCPFC6,30,"WCPFC6 approved Indonesia’s application for renewal of its CNM status with the following participatory rights:   a. WCPFC agreed that Indonesia‘s fishing activities in the Convention Area would be limited to, in accordance with CMM 2008-01, a longline big eye catch limit of 8,413 mt (less 20% or 6,730.4 mt) and purse-seine fishing on the high seas in the Convention Area is limited to 500 days. b. WCPFC6 encouraged Indonesia to apply compatible measures within its archipelagic waters given that the significance of these waters for juvenile yellowfin and bigeye catches. WCPFC6 noted that Indonesia is a recipient of the new Global Environment Facility West Pacific East Asia Oceanic Fisheries Management (WPEA OFM) Project, through the Commission, and encouraged Indonesia to work with the Commission particularly in areas of data collection improvement."
WCPFC6,31,"Indonesia expressed its appreciation to the Commission for the decision to renew its CNM status, reiterating its support for the principles of the Convention and noting benefits, such as capacity building, which accrue to Indonesia through its participation in the WCPFC. Indonesia stated that, consistent with its position throughout the Multilateral High Level Conference (MHLC) and Preparatory Conference, it considers that WCPFC CMMs do not apply to archipelagic waters.    Mexico"
WCPFC6,32,"With regard to the application for renewal of CNM status by Mexico, Japan expressed concern that Mexico did not attend the Fifth Regular Session of the Northern Committee (NC5), particularly given that Mexico catches at least 5,000 t per annum of Pacific bluefin tuna. Japan wished to make it clear that future renewals of Mexico‘s CNM status could be hampered by a continuing lack of participation in the work of the NC. Japan pointed out that Mexico's participation in the work of the NC should be considered at future renewals of the CNM status."
WCPFC6,33,"WCPFC6 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Mexico with the following participatory rights:    Mexico‘s fishing activities in the Convention Area are limited to not more than six unique purse-seine vessels fishing only in the EEZs of WCPFC Members, in accordance with appropriate bilateral agreements. WCPFC6 encouraged Mexico to participate in the work of the NC and cooperate fully with WCPFC Members in the conservation and management of Pacific bluefin tuna.  Senegal"
WCPFC6,34,"One CCM raised a continuing concern regarding species composition issues, including queries about skipjack catch and unusual ratios of swordfish and sharks, in the catch data provided by Senegal as part of its renewal application. The CCM expressed an interest in having these issues satisfactorily resolved by Senegal in the future.   6"
WCPFC6,35,"WCPFC6 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Senegal with the following participatory rights:    Senegal‘s fishing activities in the Convention Area are limited to one unique longline vessel (the Robaliera), which was fishing in the Convention Area in 2005. Noting the concern regarding the species composition of the catches reported by Senegal in WCPFC6-2009/09 (Rev. 1), WCPFC6 tasked the Secretariat to examine the very high catches of skipjack reported by the Robaliera in 2006, and inconsistent ratios of reported swordfish to shark catches. In addition, and, in in light of any new information received, the Secretariat will calculate the swordfish catch limits that would apply to Senegal pursuant to the swordfish measure (CMM 2009-03) and will be circulated to all CCMs.  Ecuador"
WCPFC6,36,"With regard to the CNM application by Ecuador, the USA indicated that it was prepared to accept it, but noted that Ecuador has been implicated in a number of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing incidents in recent years. Ecuador‘s record in this regard will be carefully monitored and scrutinized again at WCPFC7."
WCPFC6,37,"Kiribati noted that in agreeing to the participatory right granted to Ecuador, it did not recognize the limits placed on Ecuador as any basis for limiting the number of licenses Kiribati issues for fishing in its EEZ."
WCPFC6,38,"WCPFC6 approved the application for CNM status by Ecuador with the following participatory rights:   At the time of making the decision, WCPFC6 had not received sufficient data to be able to confirm an applicable purse-seine days limit for Ecuador for the high seas for 2010.  Consequently, Ecuador will be limited to zero days during 2010. WCPFC6 noted that as soon as Ecuador provides to the Commission all relevant catch and effort data that would enable the WCPFC Secretariat to calculate and verify an applicable vessel-days limit pursuant to CMM 2008-01 for yellowfin and bigeye tunas, this limit will be appropriately adjusted and circulated to all CCMs. WCPFC6 agreed to the following conditions for acceptance of Ecuador‘s CNM status: a. Participatory rights are limited to no more than ten unique vessels that shall operate exclusively in waters under the jurisdiction of the coastal States from which they receive licenses. b. All vessels will be equipped with Commission and FFA vessel monitoring system (VMS), which shall be operational at all times while the vessels are in the Convention Area.  c. The Government of Ecuador provides assurances that it will comply with all requests from Commission Members for information and documentation to investigate cases of possible illegal fishing."
WCPFC6,39,Ecuador thanked the Commission for its favorable consideration of its application.    7  Vietnam
WCPFC6,40,"Vietnam made a statement reaffirming the commitments to the Commission made in its written statements, including its acquiescence to data provision, high seas boarding and inspection (HSBI), and participation in the Commission‘s WPEA OFM Project. Vietnam also stated its desire, as a coastal developing State, to receive an allocation of fishing opportunities."
WCPFC6,41,"In response to a question, the Executive Director noted that Vietnam catches between 30,000 mt and 40,000 mt of yellowfin and bigeye tuna per year in its coastal waters but reports no catch on the high seas of the Convention Area."
WCPFC6,42,"The EU explained that a shipment of swordfish from Vietnam was barred from import to the EU on the grounds that Vietnam was not a member of the WCPFC. Once Vietnam articulated to the EU a commitment to join the WCPFC, the shipment was cleared for import. The EU stated its view that Vietnam‘s fishery has an important effect on WCPFC-managed stocks, and thus it considers that Vietnam is an important collaborator."
WCPFC6,43,"Concerns were expressed by several CCMs regarding Vietnam‘s stated aspirations to obtain an allocation for fishing rights within the WCPF Convention Area. One CCM stated that because Vietnam‘s coastal waters in the South China Sea do not fall within the boundary of the WCPF Convention Area, its catch there does not qualify as historic catch in the WCPF Convention Area."
WCPFC6,44,"WCPFC6 approved the application for CNM status by Vietnam with the following participatory rights:    Noting the need for cooperation between Vietnam and the Commission to achieve compatibility of fisheries management and conservation, WCPFC6 agreed to grant CNM status to Vietnam for 2010 on the understanding that CNM status would only relate to the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data and that Vietnam would require assistance in that regard."
WCPFC6,45,It was clarified that Vietnam would not be allowed to place vessels on the WCPFC‘s Record of Fishing Vessels.
WCPFC6,46,"Vietnam thanked the Commission for its favorable consideration of its application, reiterating that Vietnam will not have any fishing operations in the WCPFC Convention Area during 2010 (Attachment O)."
WCPFC6,47,"Many Members considered that CNMs who do not make a monetary contribution to the work of the Commission, but who gain financially from the fisheries of the Convention Area, are in effect ―free riders‖. Several Members considered that CNMs should contribute in proportion to the benefits they receive, with some of these suggesting that CNMs contribute in equal proportion to Members of the Commission. Many of these Members noted with concern the expanding budget for Commission work, and the increasing burden this is placing on small island developing States (SIDS), as creating even more urgency for equitable cost sharing."
WCPFC6,48,"Other CCMs supported the current situation of encouraging CNMs to make voluntary contributions, citing in particular the fact that CNMs do not have full participatory rights. These CCMs expressed concerns about setting a precedent in other regional fisheries management organizations.   8"
WCPFC6,49,"After further discussion, WCPFC6 adopted an amendment to CMM 2008-02 regarding financial contributions from CNMs (WCPFC6-2009/25, Attachment P). As a consequence, CMM 2008-02 is replaced by CMM 2009-11.   AGENDA  ITEM  3  -  MEMBER REPORTS 3.1 Annual Reports by the CCMs"
WCPFC6,50,"The WCPFC Compliance Manager, Andrew Richards, presented WCPFC6-2009/IP03 and WCPFC6-2009/IP06 (Rev. 1) on CCMs‘ compliance with Part 1 and Part 2 reporting. The first paper notes the number of Part 1 and Part 2 reports that have been received by the Secretariat, and the number of outstanding reports, for each year that the Commission has been operational (2005–2008). Most Part 1 and Part 2 reports are eventually received from CCMs, although the Secretariat‘s compliance reporting has, at times, been hampered by delayed submissions by some CCMs. At the request of TCC5, the Secretariat prepared the latter paper summarizing responses from CCMs to reporting obligations associated with CMMs and Commission decisions. It was noted that some CCMs had pointed out minor errors in the table and that corrections would be made in response."
WCPFC6,51,The EU noted that the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty has changed the fisheries decision-making process to a co-decision process between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. This change is likely to make the process of implementing WCPFC CMMs into EU legislation a more lengthy and time-consuming process than before
WCPFC6,52,"One CCM suggested that the deadline for submission of Part 2 of the Annual Report be changed from 31 July each year to one month prior to the meeting of the TCC. This deadline would be consistent with the deadline for Part 1 of the Annual Report, which is due one month prior to the meeting of the Scientific Committee (SC)."
WCPFC6,53,WCPFC6 agreed to revise the deadline for Part 2 of CCMs’ Annual Reports from 31 July to one month prior to the meeting of the TCC.   3.2 Statements by non-members
WCPFC6,54,No statements of non-members were provided to WCPFC6.   AGENDA  ITEM  4  -  SCIENCE ISSUES 4.1 Report of the Fifth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee
WCPFC6,55,"The Chair of the Scientific Committee, Dr Naozumi Miyabe (Japan), provided a summary of the Fifth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee (SC5), which was held 10–21August, 2009 at Port Vila, Vanuatu."
WCPFC6,56,"Dr John Hampton from SPC‘s Oceanic Fisheries Programme (SPC-OFP, which is also the scientific services provider), made a presentation on an overview of the fisheries and the status of the stocks as discussed at SC5. The provisional total Western Central Pacific Convention Area (WCPCA) tuna catch for 2008 was estimated at 2,426,195 t, the highest annual catch recorded, but only 26,000 t higher than the previous record in 2007. During 2008, the purse-seine fishery accounted for an estimated 1,783,669 t (74% of the total catch, and a record for this fishery), with the pole-and-line taking an estimated 170,805 t (7%), the longline fishery an estimated 231,003 t 9  (10%), and the remainder (10%) taken by troll gear and a variety of artisanal gears, mostly in eastern Indonesia and the Philippines. The WCPCA tuna catch (2,426,195 t) for 2008 represented 81% of the total Pacific Ocean catch of 3,009,477 t, and 56% of the global tuna catch (the provisional global estimate for 2008 is just over 4.3 million t)."
WCPFC6,57,"The skipjack stock assessment undertaken in 2008 indicates that the skipjack stock is not in an overfished state, nor is overfishing occurring. The yellowfin tuna stock assessment undertaken in 2009 indicates that overall, the stock is not in an overfished state, nor is overfishing occurring; however, there is heavy exploitation in the western equatorial Pacific where 95% of the fishery occurs, and the current status is due to the buffering that occurs as a result of low levels of exploitation in adjacent subtropical areas. The streamlined bigeye stock assessment undertaken in 2009 indicates that the stock is nearing an overfished state and that overfishing is occurring. The South Pacific albacore assessment undertaken in 2009 indicates that the stock is not in an overfished state, nor is overfishing occurring, however there is a moderate level of depletion of the portion of the stock targeted by the longline fisheries active within the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of several countries."
WCPFC6,58,"In response to questions, Dr Hampton provided the following additional information:  a. Although fishing mortality for bigeye is much greater than the fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield (MSY), stock biomass has not declined as might have been expected because recruitment during the last decade has been higher than average. If recruitment were to fall, the stock biomass would decline to levels below current levels (estimated to be 20% of unfished biomass). Biomass trajectories of tuna populations at such low stock sizes are not well known but such a situation could lead to rapid and cascading further declines.   b. No specific assumptions are made in the models for unreported catches, although the models do take into account illegal or unregulated catches. c. Sets on unassociated yellowfin tuna usually catch larger-sized individuals.Thus, if a fish aggregation device (FAD) closure leads to more sets on un-associated schools, yellowfin catches would be expected to increase. d. In the forthcoming (2010) stock assessment for skipjack, SPC will work with Japanese scientists to expand the model area and incorporate information on regional migration patterns. e. It is not clear whether inward migration from other areas of the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) compensate for the estimated stock declines in the western portion of the WCPO (Region 3), but new tagging information should indicate whether such a buffering effect may occur. f. The significantly increasing number of yellowfin catches in recent years is due to a large reported increase in medium to large un-associated purse-seine sets. The increased number of skipjack catches are part of a pattern of increasing catches in the early 1980s and since 2000; these will be further investigated.   g. The WCPFC and IATTC stock assessments assume that there are separate stocks of bigeye in the WCPO and eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). This assumption has been tested in several ways over the years and the results support the conclusion that stock assessment results based on this assumption are not dissimilar to those based on a single-stock hypothesis. h. The stock assessments make good use of a long and detailed historical dataset on yellowfin length and weight extending back to 1950. 10  i. Because the stock assessments presented were conducted in early 2009 and based on data through 2008, they are not able to assist in evaluating CMM 2008-01. Results of an evaluation of CMM 2008-01 are discussed in detail under Agenda Item 9.1."
WCPFC6,59,"WCPFC 6 accepted the following recommendations and findings from the SC on status of the stock and management advice and implications as contained in the SC5 Summary Report:    a. Yellowfin exploitation rates differ between regions, and exploitation rates continue to be highest in the western equatorial region. It is recommended that there be no increase in yellowfin fishing mortality (F) in the western equatorial region (para. 180 of the SC5 Summary Report);  b. The recommendations and work plan items relevant to FAD marking and monitoring are supported (para. 188); c. There is a role for the SC to consider scientific elements of capacity monitoring and measurement which is included within the terms of reference of the Fishing Technology Specialist Working Group (para. 215);   d. Because no new information on the stock status of skipjack was presented to SC5, the management recommendations from SC4 are maintained (para. 216); e. There is no indication that current catch levels of South Pacific albacore are not sustainable with regard to recruitment overfishing (para. 221);  f. On the basis of the 2008 stock assessment, it was recommended that the catch limits specified in CMM 2008-05 for South Pacific swordfish be carried forward to future years as a continuing measure (para. 224); g. Because no stock assessment was conducted for southwest Pacific striped marlin in 2009, the stock status description and management recommendations from SC2 are still current (para. 225); h. The fishing mortality rate of striped marlin in the North Pacific Ocean should be reduced from the current level (2003 or before). Noting that this is a bycatch species, mitigation methods should be explored in order to achieve the necessary reductions in fishing mortality (para. 234);  i. Until the Commission identifies and formally adopts appropriate reference points for northern stocks, the performance of the fishery against MSY-based reference points should be evaluated (para. 239);  j. The previous recommendation for North Pacific albacore of not increasing F from current levels (Fcurrent(2002-2004) = 0.75) is still valid; however, with the projection based on the continued current high F, the fishing mortality rate will have to be reduced (para. 245);  k. Regarding Pacific bluefin tuna (para. 259 and 263):   i. If F remains at the current level and environmental conditions remain favorable, the recruitment should be sufficient to maintain current yield well into the future.  ii. A reduction in F in combination with favorable environmental conditions, should lead to greater spawners per recruit (SPR).  iii. Increases in F above the current level, and/or unfavorable changes in environmental conditions, may result in recruitment levels that are insufficient to sustain the current productivity of the stock.  iv. Given the conclusions of the May–June 2008 stock assessment with regard to the current level of F relative to potential target reference points (TRPs) and limit reference points (LRPs), and residual uncertainties associated with key model parameters, it is important that the current level of F is not increased.  11  v. Given the conclusions of the July 2009 ISC Pacific Bluefin Tuna Working Group, the current level of F relative to potential biological reference points, and increasing trend of juvenile F, it is important that the current level of F is decreased below the 2002–2004 levels on juvenile age classes; l. The preferred hypothesis for North Pacific swordfish is that there are two stocks, one in the WCPO and the other in the EPO, with little or no mixing between them (paras. 264–267);   m. Both stocks of swordfish in the North Pacific Ocean are healthy and well above levels required to sustain recent catches; therefore, no management advice was provided (para. 268)."
WCPFC6,60,"The following recommendations of SC5 relating to status of the stock and management advice and implications as contained in the SC5 Summary Report were deferred to other items of the WCPFC6 agenda for discussion:    a. While SC recommends a 30% reduction in F of bigeye  from the 2001–2004 levels to return to FMSY, recent assessment indicates that a 34–50% reduction in F from the 2004–2007 levels would be required to reduce F to sustainable levels (para. 175, i-iii—deferred to Agenda Item 9.1); b. Assessment of bigeye stock status and evaluation of CMMs should be undertaken on an annual basis (para. 175, iv-vi—deferred to Agenda Item 9.1); c. CMM 2008-01 is likely to achieve its objective for yellowfin, but extremely unlikely to achieve its most important objective for bigeye. The SC requested the science service provider (SPC) to assess potential measures to reduce F on bigeye to 30% below 2001–2004 levels (para. 210—deferred to Agenda Item 9.1);"
WCPFC6,61,"Findings and recommendations of SC5 as contained in the SC5 Summary Report on the following topics were also accepted by WCPFC6:   a. Ecological risk assessment and SEAPODYM projects (para. 283); b. Seabirds (para. 286); c. Sharks (para. 288); d. Sea turtles (para. 290); e. Small tuna on floating objects (paras. 312-314); f. Data gaps and progress toward addressing them (para. 321, item i-v; item vi discussed under WCPFC6 Agenda Item 9.4); g. Indonesia and Philippines Data Collection Project /WPEA OFM Project (para. 360); h. Tagging initiative (paras. 361–362); i. Unloading data (para. 367); j. Review of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SPC and relations to other organizations (paras. 371–372 and discussed under WCPFC6 Agenda Item 13);  k. Development of new MOUs (para. 375); l. Special requirements of developing states (para. 385); m. Next meeting (para. 408); n. Election of SC‘s Vice-Chair (para. 409); o. Meeting of the five tuna regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) (para. 411).   p."
WCPFC6,62,"With regard to the recommendation in SC5 Summary Report, para. 321, item ii, one CCM suggested that the work should not be limited to charter arrangements. The Executive 12  Director clarified that the work pertains to vessels under ―charter, lease or other arrangements‖.  This work was further discussed under Agenda Item 9.1."
WCPFC6,63,"Also with regard to para. 321, one CCM stated that catch in zones should be attributed to the charter State, whereas catch on the high seas should be attributed to the flag State rather than the charter State."
WCPFC6,64,"Again with regard to para. 321, FFA members stated that catches should be attributed to the chartering country, including in high seas waters. FFA members also underscored the importance of ensuring that all CCMs abide by the mandatory rules of data provision as agreed on by the Commission, noting that deferments based on domestic legal constraints cannot be invoked indefinitely. In the case that such deferments continue, a comprehensive update on means and timeframes for overcoming the constraints should be requested by the Commission."
WCPFC6,65,"The Commission noted that there was some misunderstanding among CCMs at SC5 in relation to the SC‘s ability to provide advice to, make requests of, and seek expert advice from the NC, the ISC and the TCC. The Commission noted its common understanding on this issue, as contained in Article 11(5) of the Convention, which states that: ―In the exercise of their functions, each Committee may, where appropriate, consult any other fisheries management, technical or scientific organization with competence in the subject matter of such consultation and may seek expert advice as required on an ad hoc basis.‖ 4.2 Independent Review of Interim Arrangements for Science Structure and Function"
WCPFC6,66,Three recommendations from the SC5 Summary Report were presented by the SC Chair and agreed by WCPFC6 on the following topics: a. Obtaining ISC data (refer to para. 336 of the SC5 Summary Report); b. Peer review of stock assessment (para. 399); c. Future operations of the SC (paras. 404 and 407);
WCPFC6,67,"With regard to peer review of stock assessments, WCPFC6 agreed that the bigeye stock assessment should be the target of the peer review exercise. In order to achieve the maximum benefit from such a peer review, it was agreed that the peer review should be timed so as to ensure that the latest, full bigeye stock assessment for the WCPO (i.e. the 2010 WCPO bigeye assessment) is reviewed. It was noted that IATTC was also planning a peer review of a planned 2010 assessment for bigeye in the EPO and that the outcome of that review could usefully inform the bigeye assessment in the WCPO. The results of the peer review for the WCPO bigeye assessment should be reported to the WCPFC no later than WCPFC8 (December 2011).   4.3 Reference Points"
WCPFC6,68,The recommendation from the SC5 Summary Report concerning reference points (para. 277) was discussed.
WCPFC6,69,"Several FFA members spoke in support of the capacity building elements of the reference point work plan, in particular the workshop and ensuring that future work take full account of the multi-species nature of the fishery. However, some of these CCMs noted that capacity building needs may be broader than simply the topic of reference points (e.g. management procedures for multi-species fisheries, socioeconomic factors, harmonizing in zone and high seas management, etc.).    13"
WCPFC6,70,A number of CCMs voiced their concerns about endorsing proposals for technical work without full consideration of whether there will be adequate funding available as determined by the outcomes of the FAC meeting. Other CCMs expressed concerns about personnel workloads and intersessional meeting schedules.
WCPFC6,71,"Three CCMs noted that the work on reference points would facilitate informed decision-making on a revised CMM for bigeye, if necessary, at WCPFC7."
WCPFC6,72,"WCPFC6 endorsed both the short- and medium-term work plans on reference points recommended by SC5, with the proviso that adequate funding support will be secured.   4.4 Programme of work for the Scientific Committee in 2010"
WCPFC6,73,"The SC Chair noted that the proposed budget for the science programme of work for 2010 was increased by US$ 150,000 over the 2009 budget. The indicative budget for 2010 was US$ 700,000. Funding support for science services contracted from SPC-OFP and independent projects carried over from previous years (US$ 216,500) resulted in a small unallocated amount of US$ 12,050 to support other activities. The total science budget proposed by SC5 for 2010 was US$ 928,550."
WCPFC6,74,"Projects within the SC‘s work programme are either already funded by the Commission or another party; require external funding or support from individual CCMs or groups of CCMs; or are requesting Commission funding under the budget to be agreed at WCPFC6. The following projects, which are recommended for the consideration of the Commission by SC5, include:   a. Project 14. (Priority = High) Indonesia and Philippines Data Collection Project (IPDCP) – now WPEA OFM Project:  US$ 75,000; b. Project 35. (Priority = High) Refinement of bigeye parameters Pacific-wide:  a comprehensive review and study of bigeye tuna reproductive biology:  US$ 30,000; c. Project 39. (Priority = High)  Regional study of the stock structure and life-history characteristics of South Pacific albacore:  US$ 25,000; d. Project 42. (Priority = High) Pacific-wide tagging project:  US$ 10,000; e. Project 56. (Priority = Medium) Use of underwater videos and other tools to characterize species, size composition and spatial distribution of tunas aggregating around floating objects:  US$ 2,000; f. Project 57. (Priority = High)  Identifying Provisional Limit Reference Points for the key target species in the WCPFC:  US$ 20,000; and g. Project 60. (Priority = High) Collection and evaluation of purse-seine species composition data:  US$ 54,500."
WCPFC6,75,Some CCMs requested detailed budget breakdowns in order to justify the costs and determine whether any cost savings could be achieved.
WCPFC6,76,"These and other queries caused some CCMs to question the process by which i) the SC prioritizes projects, ii) the Commission approves the projects, and iii) the FAC allocates funding for these projects. These CCMs were concerned that prioritization of projects is not the responsibility of the FAC, yet there was no clear process by which limited funding is allocated among competing priority projects. This is particularly of concern when the budget is not sufficient to support all projects recommended as high priority by the Commissions‘ subsidiary bodies.    14"
WCPFC6,77,"While noting that the SC follows a rigorous prioritization process, other CCMs called for a more formalized strategic planning process to guide project prioritization by the Commission. On this basis, a draft strategic plan, which had been under consideration by the Commission since WCPFC2 in Samoa, was further refined by FAC3 during WCPFC6 (WCPFC6-2009/27)."
WCPFC6,78,WCPFC6 approved the seven priority projects listed above (para. 74) subject to confirmation of available budget by the FAC.
WCPFC6,79,WCPFC6 approved SC5‘s recommendation that the science services provider conduct assessments of WCPO bigeye and skipjack for consideration at SC6.
WCPFC6,80,"FFA members made some general comments concerning stock assessments prepared by the science services provider. The need to assess scenarios relevant to the baseline and other measures specified in the CMMs was stressed. In addition to quantifying uncertainty, it was suggested that specific recommendations about the required magnitude of management intervention should be provided. Finally, these CCMs expressed concerns about the labelling of stock assessments as ―streamlined‖ and using this to dilute the scientific advice derived from these assessments.   AGENDA  ITEM  5  -  NORTHERN COMMITTEE 5.1 Report of the Fifth Regular Session of the Northern Committee and Issues Arising"
WCPFC6,81,"The Chair of the Northern Committee, Masanori Miyahara (Japan), introduced the outcomes of the Fifth Regular Session of the Northern Committee (NC5) held 7–10 September 2009 in Nagasaki, Japan."
WCPFC6,82,"With regard to formulating management measures for striped marlin in the North Pacific, the NC Chair explained that although a 2007 stock assessment indicated that a reduction in fishing effort for this species is required, it has not been designated as a northern stock and thus the NC was constrained in developing a draft CMM. However, efforts toward a draft CMM for North Pacific striped marlin were pursued in the margins of WCPFC6 and are discussed further under Agenda Item 9.4."
WCPFC6,83,"FFA members called attention to the need to scrutinize reference points for northern stocks before such reference points are applied, and stated that since striped marlin in the North Pacific has not been designated as a northern stock, it would be inappropriate for the NC to lead the development of a CMM for this species. However, these CCMs welcomed the development of a management measure for striped marlin in the North Pacific in the margins of WCPFC6 and encouraged compatibility in management measures between WCPFC and IATTC for northern stocks."
WCPFC6,84,"With regard to a draft CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna (WCPFC-2009/DP07, discussed further under Agenda 9.4), the NC Chair noted that good progress was made with the exception of obtaining consensus from Korea, which requested more time to study the species in its own waters. A draft CMM providing for total fishing effort for Pacific bluefin tuna not to be increased from 2001–2004 levels and reduced fishing mortality on Pacific bluefin tuna juveniles, with a one-year exemption for the Korean EEZ, was agreed by the NC. The NC Chair expressed his expectation that Korea would join in the management measures for this species after the one-year exemption expires.    15"
WCPFC6,85,"Four CCMs, two of whom are also members of the NC, joined the Chair in expressing their concern regarding the exemption for the Korean EEZ and the need to implement the management measures across all fisheries catching Pacific bluefin tuna as of 2011."
WCPFC6,86,"Korea stated that the catch of Pacific bluefin, most of which occurs around Cheju Island, is mainly bycatch and amounts to less than 1,500 t. Korea is undertaking a research programme costing over US$ 1 million to understand more about the status and catch of the species in Korean waters."
WCPFC6,87,"In response to the preceding intervention by Korea, Japan queried the characterization of Korea‘s Pacific bluefin tuna catch as bycatch based on a comparison with its own records from the area. Korea corrected its statement on bycatch by saying that, in Korean law, there is no concept of bycatch or target species. Fishing licenses are permitted by fishing gear type and purse-seine vessels mainly targeting mackerels take Pacific bluefin tun,a which accounts for less than 1% of total catch by the purse-seine vessels."
WCPFC6,88,"In response to a separate question regarding catches of juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna by purse-seine vessels, Japan explained that it has implemented a voluntary minimum fish size limit of 2 kg for purse-seine vessels. Japan also explained its intention to introduce a programme to collect information on Pacific bluefin tuna imported from Korea. Comments regarding the importance of Mexico in developing management measures for this species were reiterated (see Section 2.2)."
WCPFC6,89,"The IATTC informed WCPFC that its staff will soon recommend a similar management measure for Pacific bluefin tuna for IATTC adoption. The IATTC holds substantial observer data on Pacific bluefin tuna catches and these data, and IATTC expertise, are being shared with the ISC for scientific purposes."
WCPFC6,90, The NC Chair announced that a joint meeting between the NC and IATTC is planned in order to discuss Pacific bluefin tuna management measures across the North Pacific and that CCMs and scientists will be invited to attend.
WCPFC6,91,"With regard to the NC‘s recommended revised CMM for North Pacific albacore (WCPFC-2009/DP06 which, if adopted, would replace CMM 2005-03), the NC Chair highlighted that concerns expressed by other CCMs, which are not members of the NC, centre on the southern extent of the applicable area of the CMM: either north of 20o north latitude or north from the equator. This issue is further discussed under Agenda Item 9.1."
WCPFC6,92,"Two CCMs, who are also NC members, noted that the last assessment for North Pacific albacore was conducted in 2006 based on data from 2005 and expressed concern that the next assessment is not scheduled until 2011. It was considered by these CCMs that a stock assessment should occur at least every third year."
WCPFC6,93,"The Chair of the ISC stated that constraints on staffing and funding prohibit more frequent stock assessments being carried out. In addition, much of the biological data necessary for the assessments is old and needs to be re-assessed. ISC also needs to find time to progress development of reference points. For these reasons, ISC will progress stock assessments in as timely and responsive a manner as possible given the substantial constraints."
WCPFC6,94,FFA members stated that all scientific advice should be channelled to the Commission through the SC in order to promote consistency of standards and processes.   16
WCPFC6,95,"At the request of Japan, the Secretariat agreed to establish a voluntary fund for contributions to the NC to support the work of the ISC, particularly on updating biological data for stock assessment species.  Contributions by NC members to the fund are encouraged."
WCPFC6,96,The USA requested further investigation into whether the ISC has the appropriate international agency to receive such funding.   5.2 Programme of work for the Northern Committee in 2010
WCPFC6,97,"The NC Chair referred to the programme of work contained in Attachment E of the NC5 Summary Report. He also noted the following current and future work items arising from NC5:   a. Based on the results of the 2009 North Pacific swordfish stock assessment, NC5 found that no management measures are necessary; b. NC5 notes SC5‘s recommendation to include silky sharks in the key of key shark species (WCPFC6-2009/IP14); c. NC5 acknowledges the importance of shark issues and an intention to study northern shark species and report to the Commission in future; d. Biological data are very old in some cases and should be updated through collaborative work between NC5 and ISC; e. The MOU with ISC should remain unchanged; f. While needs for peer review will continue to be discussed, it was considered that the ISC already incorporates a built-in peer review process; and g. Revision to the MOU between WCPFC and SPC that was reviewed by NC5, awaits a decision by the Commission (see Agenda Item 13)."
WCPFC6,98,The WCPFC Chairman thanked the Chair of the NC for his efforts.
WCPFC6,99,WCPFC6 accepted the report of NC5.   AGENDA  ITEM  6  -  INTER-SESSIONAL WORKING GROUP – REGIONAL OBSERVER PROGRAMME 6.1 Report of the Third Meeting of the Intersessional Working Group
WCPFC6,100,"The Chair of the IWG-ROP, Dr Charles Karnella (USA), presented the Summary Report of the Third Meeting of the Regional Observer Programme‘s Intersessional Working Group (ROP-IWG3) (WCPFC6-2009/13)."
WCPFC6,101,"The Chair noted agreement was reached on the following issues: minimum standards; vessel safety checks; observer trainer qualifications; liability and insurance; Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for observer deployment; and authorization of de-briefers and requirements for de-briefing. The ROP-IWG also agreed: that observer placement costs would be borne by the observer provider; the fisheries to be monitored and coverage levels; to establish a cadre of observers (to serve the Secretariat in special situations), and on the use of ROP workbooks."
WCPFC6,102,"Consensus was not reached on vessel size limits (i.e. whether small vessels can carry observers); the source of observers (i.e. a definition of the hybrid approach); and definitions of ―adjacent‖, ―occasional‖, ―principally‖, ―independent‖ and ―impartial‖, and ―observer trip‖.    17"
WCPFC6,103,"Other items for which work is still ongoing include costs associated with data management; ROP requirements for at-sea transhipment; technological solutions as an alternative to observers; special requirements for developing States; the ROP website; and WPCFC/IATTC observer cross-endorsement. Data forms are also needed for observer monitoring of FAD closure periods as well as a practical, working definition of a ―FAD set‖ (see further discussion under Agenda Item 9.1)."
WCPFC6,104,The Chair of the ROP-IWG proposed that as the IWG had progressed matters as far as it could at this point in the evolution of the Commission‘s observer programme the IWG should be disbanded and become an ad hoc advisory group. The ROP-IWG recommended that a technical advisory group be established to provide the Commission‘s Observer Programme Coordinator (OPC) with continuing support in the development and implementation of the ROP.
WCPFC6,105,The WCPFC Chairman thanked Dr Karnella and the ROP-IWG for their contributions to the development of the Commission‘s observer programme during the last two years.
WCPFC6,106,"FFA members spoke in favor of adopting the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) definition of FAD set within the WCPFC to ensure consistency. FFA members opposed the creation of an ROP-Technical and Operational Advisory Group (TOAG) as discussed at TCC5 citing concerns regarding cost and time, and the availability of other means of obtaining ad hoc advice for the ROP."
WCPFC6,107,WCPFC6 agreed to discontinue consideration of formation of an ROP TOAG.   AGENDA  ITEM  7  -  TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE ISSUES 7.1 Report of the Fifth Regular Sessions of the Technical and Compliance Committee
WCPFC6,108,"The Chair of the Technical and Compliance Committee, Ambassador Wendell Sanford (Canada) presented the Summary Report of the Fifth Technical and Compliance Committee meeting (TCC5), held in Palikir, Federated States of Micronesia from 1–6 October 2009.  a. Recommendations contained in the TCC5 report"
WCPFC6,109,"The following recommendations of TCC5 were considered and approved by WCPFC6 (reference to TCC5 Summary Report) without further discussion at WCPFC6:    a. Accept the recommendations of the ROP-IWG3 Summary Report and attachments (para. 14); b. CCMs should implement the ROP (CMM 2007-01) and report on their progress in Part 2 of their 2010 Annual Reports, including how they will achieve 5% coverage for their longline fleets by June 2012 (para. 15); c. Adoption of ―Minimum Standard Data Fields for Purse-Seine FAD Monitoring‖ (para. 38); d. Noted the first annual report of the ROP (para. 48); e. Task the TCC with assessing the suitability of the CNM application process and CNM status with States with only carriers and/or bunkers and provide recommendations to the Commission as to whether a modified or separate process and/or status should be developed for such States and what the process and status 18  should be and to complete this work by 2011 (para. 96, incorporated into draft Strategic Plan (Agenda Item 11); f. Outcomes of the Ad Hoc Task Group (AHTG)–Data relating to supplementary rules and procedures for surveillance and enforcement on the high seas and the use of VMS data for scientific purposes and refinements to provision of data so that the identification of individual vessels is not disclosed (paras. 113–114; see Agenda Item 8); g. Preliminary assessment of CNM applications (paras. 358–364, Agenda Item 2); h. The draft work programme and budget, with amendments proposed during TCC5, be considered by the FAC (para. 397, Agenda Item 11);  i. Agree to implement an independent performance review in early 2010 (para. 405, Agenda Item 16.1); j. Accept the draft MOU with NPAFC (para. 407, Agenda Item 13);  k. Not accept para 1(c) of the draft data exchange arrangement with IATTC (para. 410, Agenda Item 13); l. Accept the nomination of officers for the positions of Chair and Vice-Chair (para 413, Agenda Item 15); m. Accept the recommendation for date and place of TCC6 (para. 415, Agenda Item 17)."
WCPFC6,110,"In noting the TCC Summary Report, para. 388, regarding the aspirations of SIDS, Palau on behalf of FFA members thanked those CCMs who contributed to monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) discussions under the special requirements agenda item at TCC5. Palau, on behalf of FFA members, also proposed that development CCMs report on their progress in implementing Article 30 of the Convention and Resolution 2008-01 to each WCPFC session.   b. Items from TCC5 subject to further discussion under Agenda Item 9 (CMMs)"
WCPFC6,111,"Other proposals considered by TCC5 and discussed by WCPFC6 under Agenda Item 9, as indicated, include those involving FAD closure and catch retention for the high seas (para. 30, Agenda Item 9.1), cross endorsement of observers (para. 65, Agenda Item 9.4), draft CMM on regulation of transhipment (para. 83, Agenda Item 9.4), revision of CMM 2004-01 concerning carriers and bunkers (para. 95, Agenda Item 9.1), draft CMM on charter notification (para.105, Agenda Item 9.4), control of nationals (para. 248, Agenda Item 9.4), draft CMM on IUU Vessel Listing (para. 254, Agenda Item 9.1), Stateless vessels (para. 259, Agenda Item 9.4), Data buoys (para. 287, 9.4), Compliance with CMM Working Group  (para. 328, Agenda Item 9.4), Seabird By-catch Mitigation (para. 336, Agenda Item 9.1), Port Sampling and Monitoring (para. 346, Agenda Item 9.1), Sea Turtle Mitigation (para. 351, Agenda Item 9.1), and Port State Measures (para. 370, Agenda Item 9.4).   c. Issues arising from TCC5 for discussion at WCPFC6 which were not deferred to Agenda Item 9 (CMMs) 2009 FAD Closure Report (TCC5 Summary Report, para. 36)"
WCPFC6,112,"It was noted that a report requested from the Secretariat on the 2009 FAD closures (para. 36) could not be prepared as the data were received only within the week leading up to WCPFC6.  WCPFC6 agreed that a full report on the 2009 FAD closures will be prepared for discussion at TCC6.    ROP Data Management Options (TCC5 Summary Report, para.56)  19"
WCPFC6,113,"Various options for managing ROP data were discussed, including a hybrid option that the Secretariat was requested to prepare following discussions at TCC5 (WPCFC6-2009/IP-08)."
WCPFC6,114,"Some CCMs, including FFA members, favored ROP data management Option 5.1, stating that cost-effectiveness and using existing regional institutions were important considerations.  Economies of scale between the ROP and the FFA observer programmes, data validation benefits, and the long, existing and strong relationship between SPC and WCPFC, were cited as three additional reasons to involve SPC in this task."
WCPFC6,115,"Other CCMs considered the WCPFC, as an independent organization, should establish its own data management capabilities, and noted that the cost for this option was lower than the option of using SPC‘s facilities in Noumea. Some of these CCMs expressed concerns regarding a potential conflict of interest between SPC as data manager for SPC members and SPC as the science services provider to WCPFC."
WCPFC6,116,"One CCM, who is also an FFA member, noted the desire of FFA members to develop their own domestic data entry capabilities over time."
WCPFC6,117,"  WCPFC6 agreed that a draft transitional plan for consideration of financial aspects be prepared for the consideration of TCC6.  VMS Implementation (TCC5 Summary Report, paras. 115–143)"
WCPFC6,118,"In response to a question from the TCC Chair regarding implementation of the VMS in the northwest quadrant of the Convention Area by Japan, Japan responded that the issue is under consideration but it is not in position to confirm the details at this time."
WCPFC6,119,A revised draft of the VMS SOPS was produced and circulated by the Secretariat after TCC5 (WCPFC6-2009/IP-11).
WCPFC6,120,"Subsequently, WCPFC6 agreed the proposed amendments to Sections 4.5 and 4.8 of the VMS SOPs as contained in WCPFC6-2009/29 (Attachment Q)."
WCPFC6,121,FFA members called for a review of cost recovery options for VMS costs to be prepared by the Secretariat for discussion at TCC6.
WCPFC6,122,"With regard to further work on VMS SSPs, CCMs including the USA and FFA members who have been working on this issue, reported several outstanding issues, such as manual reporting in the event of VMS failure, remain to be settled.    IUU Vessel Listing Procedures regarding ownership and associated vessels (CMM 2007-03, para. 3j) (TCC5 Summary Report, paras.230–238)."
WCPFC6,123,The TCC Chair summarised the issue relating to para. 3j as discussed at TCC5.
WCPFC6,124,Korea made a statement against the use of para. 3j claiming that it could lead to unfair punishment of owners of related vessels and could promote the splintering of corporate structures in order to avoid potential liabilities.
WCPFC6,125,Several CCMs spoke in favor of elaborating on the process for applying para. 3j and then discussing this issue again at TCC6.   20
WCPFC6,126,FFA members and the USA reiterated that deferral of the application of para. 3j for one year would be the last deferral and was only to allow time to develop procedures for applying it.
WCPFC6,127,FFA members suggested that the procedures need to account for application to chartered and co-owned vessels.
WCPFC6,128,"WCPFC6 agreed that specific procedures for applying CMM 2007-03, para. 3j would be developed for discussion at TCC6 to be facilitated by the USA.    Annual Report Templates and Reporting Data Gaps (TCC5 Summary Report, para. 292)"
WCPFC6,129,"The Executive Director introduced a revised template for the Annual Report, Part 2 (WCPFC-2009-TCC5/19), noting that the template must be updated every year to account for new CMMs."
WCPFC6,130,"FFA members stated they would propose revisions to the Annual Report, Part 2 template for discussion at TCC6 noting that CCMs wish to improve their capacity to complete the template themselves."
WCPFC6,131,"Several CCMs echoed the recommendation of TCC5 (TCC5 Summary Report, para. 325) stating that reporting gaps identified in Secretariat summaries of the CCM Annual Reports should be attributed to individual CCMs."
WCPFC6,132,"WCPFC6 agreed the revised Annual Report, Part 2 template (Attachment R) for use in 2010, noting that the deadline was revised to one month prior to the meeting of the TCC (Agenda 3.1).    Catch Documentation Schemes (TCC5 Summary Report, para. 376)"
WCPFC6,133,"FFA members stated that they did not support holding an intersessional workshop on developing a catch documentation scheme (CDS), however they plan to apply to the Japan Trust Fund to obtain funding to develop a CDS prior to TCC6. FFA members also noted that CDS and related issues may be discussed at the Kobe2 workshop on monitoring, control and surveillance to be held in the EU in June 2010."
WCPFC6,134,The EU had submitted a proposal for CDS in 2006 and recommended that any other proposed CDS be developed with an awareness of the data requirements of catch certificates associated with the EU IUU fishing regulation being implemented on 1 January 2010 and the new FAO Port State Measures Agreement.
WCPFC6,135,"WPCFC6 agreed in principle on the need for a CDS, and taking note of an offer by Niue as FFC Chair to lead the process, called for a proposal to be brought forward for discussion at TCC6.    CNM Procedure Flowchart (TCC5 Summary Report, para. 381)"
WCPFC6,136,The USA informed WCPFC6 that a revised flowchart on CNM procedures (WCPFC6-2009/DP37) had been circulated incorporating the comments received from one CCM at TCC5.
WCPFC6,137, The revised flowchart is appended as Attachment S. 21  d. WCPFC IUU Vessel List
WCPFC6,138,WCPFC6 considered the Provisional IUU Vessel List prepared by TCC5.
WCPFC6,139,"Regarding the Lina, an Indonesian-flagged vessel, the USA and France summarized their respective nomination information as presented in detail at TCC5. The USA stated that the Lina was documented fishing in the WCPFC Convention Area without being on the WCPFC RFV and without having been authorized by Indonesia to fish in the Convention Area. France stated that the vessel had conducted fishing operations in the Convention Area without being on the WCPFC RFV."
WCPFC6,140,"Subsequent to TCC5, Indonesia responded to a letter from the Executive Director notifying it that the Lina had been placed on the Provisional IUU Vessel List, stating that the owners of the vessel had admitted to the violations and would accept the sanction of the Indonesian government but that investigation of the incident was still underway."
WCPFC6,141,"At WCPFC6, Indonesia stated that it had sent a letter of warning to the vessel, but because the Lina was still at sea, more time was needed to complete its investigations of the incident. It stated its strong commitment to combating IUU activities, noting extenuating circumstances surrounding TCC5, which occurred at the time of the Indonesian presidential elections. Indonesia noted that the Lina is now on the WPCFC RFV (as of October 2009), and is also on the Organization for Promotion of Responsible Tuna Fisheries (OPRT) vessel list."
WCPFC6,142,"Some CCMs spoke in support of Indonesia on the basis that the violation occurred due to an administrative error, rather than any action by the fishing master, and stating that because Indonesia is a developing State it should be given special consideration."
WCPFC6,143,"During WCPFC6, and after consulting with officials in Jakarta, Indonesia issued letters to the USA and France, and informed WPCF6 of the content of these letters (Attachment T)."
WCPFC6,144,"The USA stated that because the letter maintains that sanctions will be imposed in the future, and because it is not clear what rights the owner or master may have to appeal the sanction under Indonesian law, the USA intended to carry through with the listing of the Lina. If documentation is provided showing that the sanction was imposed, procedures for de-listing intersessionally will be considered."
WCPFC6,145,"France stated that the IUU listing procedures under CMM 2007-03 must be followed.  These procedures require that until material warranties are provided showing appropriate actions have been taken, listing is the appropriate action, and once such warranties are received, and if sanctions are applied effectively, de-listing can be initiated."
WCPFC6,146,WCPFC6 agreed by consensus to list the Lina on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,147,"Concerning Senta, a Panamanian-flagged vessel nominated by France, France explained that the Senta is a carrier vessel found with fish in its hold from the Minako, an Indonesia-flagged fishing vessel. Neither the Senta nor the Minako were on the WCPFC RFV at the time of the incident."
WCPFC6,148,"Subsequent to TCC5, Panama did not respond to a letter from the Executive Director informing it that the Senta had been placed on the Provisional IUU Vessel List.  22"
WCPFC6,149," Dr Tsamenyi, WCPFC Legal Advisor, advised that Panama is not a member of the WCPFC and therefore not bound by the CMMs adopted by the Commission. However, Panama is a party to the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and is thereby obliged to ensure that its flagged vessels do not undermine the CMMs adopted by the WCPFC."
WCPFC6,150,WCPFC6 agreed by consensus to list the Senta on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,151,"The Minako, an Indonesian-flagged vessel nominated by France, was found to have transhipped catch to the Senta within the WCPF Convention Area. The Minako was not on the WCPFC RFV at the time of the incident. In listing the Minako on the Provisional IUU Vessel List, TCC5 considered that the Minako had fished in the WCPF Convention Area."
WCPFC6,152,"Dr Tsamenyi explained that under para. 3(a) of CMM 2007-03, any fishing vessel that harvests species covered by the WCPFC Convention in the Convention Area, and is not on the WCPFC RFV, or is not fishing exclusively in waters under the jurisdiction of its flag State, can be considered to be conducting IUU fishing activities."
WCPFC6,153,"Subsequent to TCC5, Indonesia responded to a letter from the Executive Director notifying it that the Minako had been placed on the Provisional IUU Vessel List, stating that the owners of the vessel had admitted to the violations and would accept the sanction of the Indonesian government but that an investigation of the incident was still underway."
WCPFC6,154,"As with the Lina, some CCMs spoke in favor of granting leniency to Indonesia on the grounds that it is a developing country."
WCPFC6,155,"During WCPFC6, and after consulting with officials in Jakarta, Indonesia issued a letter to France concerning the Lina and the Minako (Attachment U)."
WCPFC6,156,"France maintained the same position regarding the Minako as it did regarding the Lina, and stated that given the currently available evidence, listing is required. Once material warranties are provided documenting the effective imposition of the sanction, de-listing can be considered."
WCPFC6,157,WCPFC6 agreed by consensus to list the Minako on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,158,"Regarding the Chia Shun Hsing No. 6, a Chinese Taipei-flagged vessel, it was noted at TCC5 that settlement negotiations were underway but an agreement had not yet been reached.  Subsequent to TCC5, the USA informed WCPFC6 that the matter had been settled to its satisfaction."
WCPFC6,159,WCFPC agreed by consensus not to list the Chia Shun Hsing No. 6 on the WPCFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,160,"Regarding the Maan Feng Yu No. 36, a Chinese Taipei-flagged vessel, it was noted at TCC5 that settlement negotiations were underway but an agreement had not yet been reached.  Subsequent to TCC5 the USA informed WCPFC6 that the matter had been settled to its satisfaction."
WCPFC6,161,WCFPC agreed by consensus not to list the Maan Feng Yu No. 36 on the WPCFC IUU Vessel List.    23
WCPFC6,162," New Zealand summarized its case for nominating the China-flagged vessels Rong Yuan Yu 86, Rong Yuan Yu 87, Rong Da Yang No.6, Rong Da Yang No.7, Rong Da Yang No.8 and Rong Da Yang No.9.  hese vessels were fishing in the WCPF Convention Area but were not on the WCPFC RFV due to communication issues between China and the WCPFC Secretariat. The vessels were, however, authorized to fish in the Convention Area by China."
WCPFC6,163,"In discussions with China subsequent to TCC5, China stated that it had taken steps to reinforce its vessel authorization procedures. Specifically, China will henceforth require that all vessels are listed on the WCPFC RFV before they are authorized to fish in the Convention Area."
WCPFC6,164,"New Zealand, noting China‘s actions, and China‘s support for an amendment to CMM 2004-01 specifying the responsibility of flag States to ensure their fishing vessels have been placed on the WCPFC RFV before they commence fishing (see Agenda Item 9.1a), stated that the matter had been settled to its satisfaction."
WCPFC6,165,"WCFPC agreed by consensus not to list the Rong Yuan Yu 86, Rong Yuan Yu 87, Rong Da Yang No.6, Rong Da Yang No.7, Rong Da Yang No.8 and Rong Da Yang No.9 on the WPCFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC6,166,"With regard to the Yuh Chang No. 3, a Chinese Taipei-flagged vessel, New Zealand reported that some information on the vessel had been provided to the Secretariat in January 2008, but that at the time of sighting, in September 2008, the vessel was not on the WCPFC RFV, even though it was authorized to fish by Chinese Taipei. New Zealand noted that this incident highlighted the need for more clarity in the administrative process by which the Secretariat places vessels on the RFV (e.g. Secretariat acknowledges receipt of information, notifies the flag State when the vessel is placed on the RFV, and the flag State verifies that the information on the Commission‘s website is correct)."
WCPFC6,167,"New Zealand, noting the circumstances of the incident, as well as Chinese Taipei‘s improved administrative procedures and support for an amendment to CMM 2004-01 (see Agenda Item 9.1a), stated that the matter had been settled to its satisfaction."
WCPFC6,168,WCFPC agreed by consensus not to list the Yuh Chang No. 3 on the WPCFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,169,"Concerning the Yu Fong 168, a Chinese Taipei-flagged vessel, the nominating State, RMI summarized that the vessel had seen sighted fishing inside RMI‘s EEZ but fled, causing damage to an FSM patrol boat in pursuit. The vessel, owner, master and crew have not been located."
WCPFC6,170, Chinese Taipei stated that it had revoked the license for this vessel and removed it from the WCPFC RFV. Chinese Taipei welcomes cooperation from other CCMs to prevent this vessel from continuing to fish illegally.
WCPFC6,171,WCPFC6 agreed by consensus to list the Yu Fong 168 on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,172,"With regard to the Daniela F, a Venezuela-flagged vessel, on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List through nomination by France, WCPFC6 was informed that a French court in Papeete has made a judgement and the vessel has paid the fine. France therefore requested that the Daniela F be removed from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.  24"
WCPFC6,173,WCPFC6 agreed by consensus to remove the Daniela F from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,174,"FSM informed WCPFC6 that the incident involving the Jinn Feng Tsair #1 has not yet been settled to its satisfaction as the vessel has not yet submitted to justice in the FSM and has not paid any penalty to the FSM. However, dialogue with the flag State, Chinese Taipei, continues and FSM looks forward to resolving this issue in the near future."
WCPFC6,175,Chinese Taipei committed to continuing to try to resolve the incident.
WCPFC6,176,WCPFC6 agreed by consensus to retain the Jinn Feng Tsair #1 on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,177,"Thailand informed WCPFC6 that it had distributed RFMO IUU Vessel Lists to its traders and asked them not to purchase any products from these vessels. In addition, Thailand is amending its fisheries law to prohibit landing of IUU fishing products."
WCPFC6,178,"WCPFC6 discussed issues raised at TCC5 (TCC5 Summary Report, para. 221) concerning alleged incidents of IUU fishing that occurred after 120 days in advance of the TCC meeting, and thus were unable to be brought before TCC5 for consideration as the deadline for CCMs to transmit nominations for the Provisional IUU Vessel List had already passed."
WCPFC6,179,"Reports provided by New Zealand concerning the Ta Chuan 101, Tokelau concerning the Zhao Yuan Yu, and Palau concerning an unnamed vessel indicated that investigations were still underway."
WCPFC6,180,"FSM reported that prosecution of an unnamed vessel accused of unauthorized operations within FSM‘s EEZ is proceeding, and if the case is satisfactorily settled, FSM may not proceed with nomination of the vessel for the WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC6,181,These and other CCMs noted their concern with the existing provisions of current listing procedures that would appear to allow vessels to continue fishing on the high seas until the Commission considers whether to list them at WCPFC7 (i.e. potentially for up to 18 months).
WCPFC6,182,"One CCM stated that the 120-day rule is necessary for due process, however, it noted that the WCPFC IUU Vessel List was designed to sanction those vessels that were not sanctioned by their flag States in response to notification of the incident. Thus, if the flag State responds promptly, the vessel can be sanctioned shortly after the incident occurs."
WCPFC6,183,New Zealand informed WCPFC6 that it is considering proposing revisions to CMM 2007-03 for consideration at TCC6 to deal with sanctions for flag States that repeatedly fail to take appropriate actions in response to notification of IUU fishing incidents; improved use of other regional tools to deal with IUU fisheries issues; and an enhanced process for dealing with incidents that occur after the current deadline for nominating vessels for IUU listing of 120 days in advance of the TCC meeting.   e. Adoption of the TCC5 Summary Report
WCPFC6,184,WCPFC6 adopted the TCC5 Summary Report.    25
WCPFC6,185,"The WCPFC Chair expressed his appreciation to outgoing TCC Chair, Ambassador Wendell Sanford, for his valuable contributions to the WPCFC. He noted with gratitude Canada‘s agreement to allow Ambassador Sanford to complete his term as TCC Chair after taking up his appointment in Brunei late last year.   AGENDA  ITEM  8  -  RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE PROTECTION , ACCESS TO, AND DISSEMINATION OF DATA COMPILED BY THE COMMISSION"
WCPFC6,186,"The Chair of the AHTG–Data, Holly Koehler (USA) presented a report on the work of the task group since WCPFC5 (WCPFC6-2009/15 [Rev. 1]). After several further iterations, a set of data rules and procedures were brought to TCC5 for discussion and were agreed on. In addition, the task group examined an issue arising from the Commission‘s 2007 Rules and Procedures, involving data associated with strata of time and area involving three vessels or less. The task group prepared a recommendation that was agreed on by TCC5. Having accomplished these tasks, the AHTG–Data Chair requested guidance on the need for continued work of the task group."
WCPFC6,187,"WCPFC6 adopted the Rules and Procedures for the Protection, Access to, and Dissemination of High Seas Non-Public Domain Data and Information Compiled by the Commission for the Purpose of Monitoring, Control of Surveillance (MCS) Activities and the Access to and Dissemination of High Seas VMS Data for Scientific Purposes (WCPFC6-2009/15 (rev. 1), Attachment B) and appended hereto at Attachment V."
WCPFC6,188,"WCPFC6 agreed, as advised by the AHTG–Data and recommended by TCC5, that the Commission amend its Procedures and Standards for Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission to include in Section 4 (Catch and effort data aggregated by time period and geographic area) the following new paragraph: ―CCMs are to provide, to the extent possible, the number of individual vessels per stratum and area covered by their operational data with the aggregated catch and effort data they submit to the Commission‖."
WCPFC6,189,"RMI, on behalf of FFA members, suggested that the work of the AHTG–Data should continue on an ad hoc basis. Several issues potentially requiring the attention of the AHTG were identified, including provision of monitoring, control and surveillance data by chartered vessels; procedures for routine dissemination of the Commission‘s data; and ongoing advice and recommendations on data rules and procedures. The first of these issues was suggested as a priority for 2010 at TCC6."
WCPFC6,190,WCPFC6 agreed that the work of the AHTG–Data should continue on an ad hoc basis with an initial focus at TCC6 on considering the issue of data provision by chartered vessels.
WCPFC6,191,"The Chair thanked the Chair of the AHTG–Data, Ms Holly Koehler (USA) for the pioneering work of the AHTG–Data, and for her dedicated efforts toward realizing these achievements.   AGENDA  ITEM  9  -  CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES 9.1 Review of existing conservation and management measures a. CMM 2004-01 and carriers and bunkers flagged to non-CCMs 26"
WCPFC6,192,"RMI and Nauru introduced WCPFC6-2009/DP04, regarding a proposed amendment to CMM 2004-01 on the treatment of carriers and bunkers flagged to non-CCMs. The key outstanding issue concerned the existence of an Interim Register during a transition from the current system to one in which all carriers and bunkers would need to be flagged to a CCM (including CNMs) before being placed on the WCPFC RFV."
WCPFC6,193,"This amendment was supported by FFA members who stated that a strong impetus would be needed to encourage non-CCMs to become CNMs, and that alternative means for encouraging this, as proposed by other CCMs, would not be sufficient."
WCPFC6,194,"Some CCMs noted a potential connection between non-CCM flagged carriers and bunkers and IUU fishing activities, and thus supported a prompt solution to the existing situation of the WCPFC Temporary Register of Carriers and Bunkers."
WCPFC6,195,"Some CCMs requested flexibility for extraordinary circumstances that might arise when, for example, catches are very large and additional carrier vessels are required for short-term duty."
WCPFC6,196,"A concern was also raised that the amendment should also clarify situations arising from chartering, particularly in terms of whether the flag State or the chartering State takes the lead on registration and reporting."
WCPFC6,197,"After further discussion during WCPFC6, RMI and Nauru presented a revised version of the measure (WCPFC6-2009/DP04 [Rev. 2])."
WCPFC6,198,"The Executive Director requested guidance on the amount of the nominal registration fee, and it was noted that the FFA fee for inclusion of a vessel on the FFA Register is US$ 2,500 per vessel."
WCPFC6,199,"China explained that it, and perhaps other CCMs, may require flexibility in the application of the requirement under para. 23 to revoke the vessel‘s authorization to fish because it does not currently have the capability under national law to do so."
WCPFC6,200,"WCPFC6 adopted the amendment to CMM 2004-01 regarding carriers and bunkers as contained in WCPFC6-2009/DP04 (Rev. 2) (appended as Attachment W) with the amount of the nominal registration fee (para. 31) of US$ 2,500."
WCPFC6,201,"Recognizing that a number of other CMMs refer to CMM 2004-01, New Zealand suggested that work be initiated prior to TCC6 to prepare amendments necessary to reflect the changes."
WCPFC6,202,"Niue, on behalf of FFA members, proposed an additional amendment to CMM 2004-01 clarifying that flag States are responsible for ensuring that their vessels are on the RFV before commencing fishing operations in the area (WCPFC6-2009/DP10)."
WCPFC6,203,"Some CCMs expressed concerns about administrative issues that have hindered prompt placement of vessels on the RFV, but stated that improvement in procedures is expected, and thus the amendment could be supported."
WCPFC6,204,Two CCMs pointed out that the identification of minimum standard data fields for the RFV (i.e. those would need to be provided to the Secretariat before the vessel could be placed on the RFV) was an important outstanding issue. One of these CCMs considered that it was impractical 27  for the Secretariat to require data for all of the RFV data fields for the initial placement on the RFV.
WCPFC6,205,WCPFC6 approved the amendment to CMM 2004-01 contained in WCPFC6-2009/DP10 clarifying that flag States are responsible for ensuring that their vessels are on the RFV prior to commencing operations in the WCPFC Convention Area.   b. CMM 2005-03 North Pacific albacore
WCPFC6,206,"The NC Chair presented a proposal to revise CMM 2005-03 on North Pacific albacore (WCPFC-2009/DP06). The NC Chair acknowledged the concerns of FFA members regarding the authority of the NC for the Convention Area north of 20o north latitude only, but highlighted the importance of a CMM that covered the entire distribution of the stock, which in the case of North Pacific albacore extends to the equator. It was noted that IATTC has in place a similar measure that covers all of its Convention Area north of the equator. The NC Chair proposed that the Commission adopt the proposed CMM under its mandate to manage stocks in the Convention Area over their entire range."
WCPFC6,207,"FFA members stated they could not support the measure because it exceeded the area of competence of the NC, and consultation within the Commission had been insufficient to generate the required understanding of the proposal among non-NC members."
WCPFC6,208,"Several CCMs, while noting that the proposal covered an area for which the Commission, rather than the NC, was responsible (i.e. 0–20o N), stated that they would be comfortable with a Commission decision to support the proposed CMM because it is important to cover the entire range of the stock."
WCPFC6,209,"After subsequent discussion in the margins of WPCFC6, there appeared to be consensus support for the application of the measure north of 20o degrees north latitude, but not in waters between the equator and 20o N."
WCPFC6,210,WCPFC6 agreed to postpone further consideration of the measure until next year.   c.  CMM 2005-03 IUU listing procedures
WCPFC6,211,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members, presented WCPFC6-2009/DP11, which contained a proposal to amend CMM 2007-03, para. 15. The intent of the amendment is to require that sanctions for IUU fishing violations that occur in national waters be resolved to the satisfaction of the coastal State in whose waters they occurred. The amendment thus makes separate provisions for violations that occur in national waters and those that occur on the high seas."
WCPFC6,212,"Some CCMs did not support the amendment because, according to their interpretation, international law requires that sanctions be imposed by the flag State. These CCMs considered that the cooperation of the flag State is an important element of deterring IUU fishing."
WCPFC6,213,"Some of these CCMs noted that flag State penalties will vary according to their national legal systems, and this context needed to be appreciated when considering whether the penalty was of adequate severity."
WCPFC6,214,One CCM suggested that the proposed amendment to CMM 2007-03 be modified to include the requirement that penalties imposed by the coastal State not be discriminatory.    28
WCPFC6,215,"FFA members and some other CCMs voiced their strong support for the amendment.  These CCMs pointed out that the current WCPFC IUU vessel listing procedures do not assist coastal States in bringing IUU vessels to justice under their own legal systems, and thus do not assist coastal States in obtaining compensation for damages incurred."
WCPFC6,216,"Because agreement could not be reached, further discussion was deferred until TCC6."
WCPFC6,217,New Zealand again noted its interest in proposing a number of revisions to CMM 2007-03 for discussion at TCC6 (see Agenda Item 7d).   d. CMM 2007-04 Seabirds
WCPFC6,218,"The Executive Director introduced WCPFC6-2009/IP05, which contains a comparison of Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) seabird mitigation measures and those contained in CMM 2007-04. It was noted that CMM 2007-04 requires annual consideration of revisions to the specified mitigation measures but that neither SC5 nor TCC5 produced recommendations on amendment of seabird mitigation measures for the Commission this year."
WCPFC6,219,"Several CCMs welcomed the comparison with IOTC‘s new measures for further consider at SC6 and TCC6, and suggested that the Kobe2 workshop on bycatch issues to be held in the USA in 2010 will also inform this process."
WCPFC6,220,Australia indicated that it had a range of comments on the paper that it would pass on directly to the Secretariat.  One of these comments suggests incorporating a diagram similar to IOTC‘s into CMM 2007-04.
WCPFC6,221,WCPFC6 agreed to task TCC6 with considering updates to CMM 2007-04 and making a recommendation to WCPFC7 in this regard.   e.  CMM 2008-01 Yellowfin and bigeye  Evaluating the effectiveness of CMM 2008-01 and additional proposals to close high seas areas
WCPFC6,222,"John Hampton (SPC-OFP) presented two papers (WCPFC6-2009-IP17 and 18) that relate to CMM 2008-01, and an assessment of the potential effectiveness of this measure. A large part of this work involved determining the limits that apply to various fisheries under the measure. The projections showed that CMM 2008-01 is highly unlikely to meet its objectives of a 30% reduction in bigeye fishing mortality from 2001–2004 levels, and maintenance of the bigeye stock at a level capable of producing MSY over the long term. The measures are predicted to result in little if any reduction in bigeye F/FMSY from the high levels in excess of 2.0 estimated for 2007–2008, and accordingly, biomass is predicted to fall to around 0.4–0.6 of biomass at MSY. The main reasons for the lack of effectiveness of the measure are the:   a. reductions in longline catch do not result in the required reduction in fishing mortality on adult bigeye;  b. increase in purse-seine effort allowed under the measure, and the increase in purse-seine catchability (fishing mortality per unit of effort) that has occurred since 2001–2004, is not sufficiently offset by the FAD and high seas pocket closures to reduce purse-seine fishing mortality below 2001–2004 average levels; and c. exclusion of archipelagic waters, which encompass most of the fishing activity of the Indonesian and Philippines domestic fleets and significant amounts of purse-seine effort in Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands.   29"
WCPFC6,223,"Additional requests were made at SC5 for further analyses, particularly in relation to the various exemptions and special provisions of CMM 2008-01, but due to limited resources it was not possible to complete this work in its entirety. Analyses showed that removal of all exemptions and special provisions should result in a more effective management measure with respect to reductions in fishing mortality, but that alone was insufficient to meet the objective of CMM 2008-01."
WCPFC6,224,"Some CCMs expressed disappointment that the scenarios modeled in the papers did not follow the requests of SC5 and that some of them are closely connected with possible allocation of fishing opportunities, which is beyond the mandate of SC and SPC, and is a matter for the Commission. They also expressed concern that the baseline in the scenarios was changed from 2001–2004 to 2007, which was inconsistent with the request by SC5 (WCPFC6-2009/IP22)."
WCPFC6,225,"Dr Hampton responded that some scenarios were composites of individual exemptions because there was not sufficient staff time available to model all individual exemptions separately. Regarding the change in the baseline, Dr Hampton explained that although CMM 2008-01 refers to a baseline of 2001–2004, management scenarios need to be framed in terms of reducing fishing effort from current levels. This is because effort has continued to increase since the baseline."
WCPFC6,226,"Some CCMs expressed surprise at the model results, which showed that a) closure of the two high seas pockets in 2010 would have almost no effect on the stock; and b) the bigeye stock is depleted to the extent that the allowable catch of bigeye by longliners is unlikely to be attained regardless of how much effort is expended. Given the lack of effectiveness of the closure, these CCMs questioned the fairness of imposing the provisions of CMM 2008-01."
WCPFC6,227,Some CCMs attributed the likely failure of CMM 2008-01 to meet its objectives to the number of exemptions that were granted to various CCMs‘ fisheries. Some of these CCMs called for all provisions of CMM 2008-01 to be applied consistently and fairly throughout the Convention Area.
WCPFC6,228,"In responding to these points, Dr Hampton clarified that the effect of the 2010 pocket closure depends on whether the fishing effort that would have been expended there is cancelled or simply moved to another area. He also noted that if all exemptions to the measure were removed this would reduce the amount of overfishing by 55% (i.e. F/FMSY would fall from 2.09 to 1.49)."
WCPFC6,229,Several CCMs expressed support for a seasonal closure of appropriate duration of the entire purse-seine fishery in the WCPO rather than just a seasonal closure for purse-seine fishing on FADs. One CCM added that the purse-seine fishery could be made subject to a time/area closure when and where juvenile tuna catch rates are particularly high. One CCM also proposed identification and protection of tuna spawning and nursery areas.
WCPFC6,230,"Dr Hampton responded that since tropical tuna spawning grounds vary with water temperature over a very wide area, identifying discrete nursery and spawning areas would be difficult."
WCPFC6,231,One CCM suggested that the impacts of CMM 2008-01 on skipjack fisheries should be considered.    30
WCPFC6,232,Dr Hampton responded that a skipjack stock assessment would be conducted in 2010.  Initial indications are that CMM 2008-01 did not have a negative effect on skipjack fisheries.
WCPFC6,233,"Most CCMs agreed that while it is not acceptable to do nothing in response to the SPC report, it was not practical to amend CMM 2008-01 at WCPFC6. These CCMs also agreed that a strong package of revised measures is clearly needed and should be progressed as soon as possible."
WCPFC6,234,"Some CCMs noted that empirical data from the two-month 2009 FAD closure was not used in the SPC analyses, but that once it becomes available it should inform both SPC and SC and provide a better scientific basis for the evaluation of the current measure and consideration of new provisions for a future measure."
WCPFC6,235,Dr. Hampton responded that observer data are critical to obtaining better spatial distribution data for purse-seine catches; port sampling cannot achieve this objective due to the potential for transhipment to occur between the catch location and port.
WCPFC6,236,Two CCMs requested an immediate review of CMM 2008-01 and adoption of revised provisions by WCPFC6.
WCPFC6,237,WPCFC6 accepted the recommendation of WCPFC6-2009/IP18 (i.e. that CMM 2008-01 will not achieve its stated objective of a 30% reduction in bigeye fishing mortality from 2001-2004 or 2004 levels). It was agreed to consider the issues raised in the discussion at WCPFC6 through the 2010 SC and TCC forums with a view to bringing forward a new package of measures for consideration at WCPFC7.
WCPFC6,238,"The Philippines presented a proposal limiting the intended closure of the two western high seas pockets provided for in CMM 2008-01 (WCPFC6-2009/DP13 Rev.1). The Philippines maintained that adopting the provision would place a disproportionate burden on the Philippines, thereby causing significant negative social and economic disruption, and would potentially displace the Philippine high seas fleet into areas closer to the Philippines that are recognized tuna spawning and nursery areas. These areas support high catches of juvenile yellowfin and bigeye tuna, which the Philippines has pledged to protect under the Coral Triangle Initiative. This would result in adverse impacts on the stock throughout its range."
WCPFC6,239,"Japan, on behalf of Asian fishing nations, expressed concern over the unfair nature of CMM 2008-01, and stated that they are not in a position to accept any further reduction on their side unless the unfairness is resolved (Attachment X). Japan also called on the USA to increase its efforts to mitigate the catch of small bigeye by their fleets."
WCPFC6,240,"The USA replied that it was making its best efforts to do so, noting that the solution to mitigating juvenile bigeye mortality was likely to be found in cooperation with industry. The USA also stated that the reported high proportion of bigeye in the catch of purse seiners operating in the central Pacific region may be a reflection on a history of robust catch sampling of vessels operating in that area, and that with improved sampling of vessels in the western tropical Pacific, it is possible that increased proportions of bigeye in the catch of purse seiners in that region will be reported."
WCPFC6,241,"A proposal was made by Cooks Islands, and supported by several CCMs, including FFA members, to close two additional high seas pockets (located between Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu; and the Cook Islands, French Polynesia and Kiribati) to purse-seine fishing. Cook 31  Islands noted that Article 8 (4) of the Convention gives special attention to management of such pockets, and stated that its proposal was based both on biological conservation needs as well as the need to reduce safe havens for IUU fishing activities. It was also noted that the Commission is required to consider closure of these two additional high seas pockets by CMM 2008-01, para. 22."
WCPFC6,242,"Fiji requested special consideration for its domestic longline fleet, which it noted was required to operate in the high seas pocket west of Fiji in order to maintain viable operations. Fiji wanted to avoid the possibility that its longline vessels would be nominated for IUU fishing if the pocket was closed and its vessels were detected operating in it."
WCPFC6,243,"Some CCMs stated that they considered the 2010 high seas pocket closures ineffective and unfair, and therefore could not support the proposal by Cook Islands."
WCPFC6,244,Greenpeace stated that high seas pocket closures are critical to protecting areas that are highly vulnerable to IUU fishing. Greenpeace also called for a ban on FAD fishing.
WCPFC6,245,"Papua New Guinea, supported by several CCMs, including FFA members, raised concerns regarding a potential shift in effort to model region 4 — where catch per unit of effort was reported to be 40 times greater than in other areas — that may result when the two western high seas pockets are closed on 1 January 2010. These concerns echo the PNA‘s Bikenibeu Declaration, which notes the serious impact of high seas, distant-water longline and purse-seine operations on bigeye stocks. In order to avoid having the 2010 high seas pocket closures result in a greater impact on the stocks (i.e. through effort shifts), Papua New Guinea called for a closure of the high seas areas of the Convention Area east of 170° E between 10o N and 20o S to purse-seine fishing (WCPFC6-2009/DP-41)."
WCPFC6,246,"The CCMs who did not support Cook Islands‘ proposal also did not support the proposal by Papua New Guinea. In addition to their previously stated reasons, these CCMs noted the lack of a clear biological basis for the proposal."
WCPFC6,247,"Other CCMs asked for clarification on the proposal, including issues of whether there could be more specific area closures identified within the vast area proposed, and for further consideration of potential impacts to fleets operating out of American Samoa."
WCPFC6,248,"The IATTC observer noted that Papua New Guinea‘s proposal covered some areas that will also be subject to IATTC measures, and this overlap could create confusion."
WCPFC6,249,"WCPFC agreed to maintain its intention to close the two western high seas pockets to purse-seine fishing on 1 January 2010 as agreed on at WCPFC5, and deferred the Philippines’ proposal to TCC6 for further discussion. Proposals to close two additional high seas pockets, or the entire high seas portion of the Convention Area between 20o N and 20o S to purse-seine fishing were not adopted."
WCPFC6,250,"Cook Islands stated that it remained deeply concerned about the issue, and planned to bring forward a similar proposal to TCC6 for further discussion."
WCPFC6,251,Several CCMs highlighted the connection between conservation and management of bigeye and yellowfin resources and the issue of capacity. These CCMs suggested that the former cannot be achieved without due regard to addressing the latter.    32
WCPFC6,252,"Chinese Taipei stated that it is willing to assist developing countries, particularly SIDS, to develop their fisheries so that they can make use of the marine resources in their waters for the development of their economies. In this connection, Resolution 2008-01 was adopted last year urging developed CCMs to render assistance to SIDS in this respect. After the adoption of this resolution, Chinese Taipei was approached by many officials and entrepreneurs requesting the building of purse-seine vessels in its shipyards. As previously mentioned in different fora, Chinese Taipei has domestic legislation to regulate the building of fishing vessels for export and the export of second hand vessels with the objective of avoiding an increase in fishing capacity in the region. Chinese Taipei is somewhat puzzled as to whether or not such building of purse-seine vessels is consistent with Resolution 2008-01, and will not be taken as increase in fishing capacity by Chinese Taipei. Chinese Taipei asked for guidance from the Commission on which it will consider an adjustment to its policy."
WCPFC6,253,"FFA members noted that they cooperate with CCMs as a means of participating in the management of shared stocks but that they have their own tools (e.g. the Third Implementing Arrangement of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement and the Vessel Day Scheme) to manage fishing effort. FFA members stated that they approach issues related to managing capacity with caution, and reject any suggestion of further controls on vessel acquisition from distant-water fishing States."
WCPFC6,254,"Some FFA members also reminded WCPFC6 that the aspirations of SIDS need not necessarily result in catching more fish; rather, the goal would be to add value to and maximize the benefits from fish that are already being caught. The ongoing assistance of some distant-water fishing States in this regard (e.g. onshore processing) was noted. It was also emphasized that maximizing value in this way could generate additional financial resources to sustain the Commission‘s work."
WCPFC6,255,"The Chair noted that in order to support the legitimate aspirations of SIDS to develop and benefit from their resources, while at the same time conserve and manage fish stocks in an effective manner, the transfer of fishing capacity to developing countries should be accompanied by a reduction in the fishing capacity of distant-water fishing States."
WCPFC6,256,The EU requested that the record state that their understanding with regard to observers and the cross-endorsement procedures as articulated under Agenda Item 9.4c below also applies to CMM 2008-01.    High seas alternative to FAD closure
WCPFC6,257,"The Executive Director introduced WCPFC6-2009/IP12, which reports on the alternative measures taken by Japan, New Zealand and the Philippines under paras. 15 and 16 of CMM 2008-01. In July, New Zealand decided it would not pursue the alternative measures and would participate in the FAD closures. Data submitted by these three CCMs are profiled in the paper."
WCPFC6,258,"New Zealand explained that it withdrew from its intention to apply the alternative measures due to higher bigeye catches than anticipated and because of difficulties in reconciling the outcomes of port sampling with the historical estimates of bigeye catch used to set their bigeye catch limit. New Zealand reported that it is continuing with sampling work and trials of methods to reduce catches of juvenile bigeye by purse-seine vessels, and hopes to report the results to future meetings of the SC.   33"
WCPFC6,259,Japan informed WCPFC6 that it does not wish to apply the alternative measures in 2010 and will participate in the FAD closure.
WCPFC6,260,"Several CCMs raised concerns that the 2009 FAD closure had not been applied uniformly in the EEZs of some PNA members that had provided additional exemptions for at least one distant-water nation fishing partner. Some CCMs suggested that a full set of information should be available to TCC6 in 2010 to allow a full assessment of the implementation of each provision of CMM 2008-01 in 2009, and to review its application by individual fleets and coastal States."
WCPFC6,261,"RMI, on behalf of FFA members, expressed appreciation for the data generated through the application of the alternative measures, and stated that it remains open to incentive-based approaches in the future. However, it does not support application of the alternative measures for 2010 and 2011."
WCPFC6,262, WCPFC6 agreed that alternative measures for the high seas were only available in 2009 and that no alternative measures would apply in 2010.  FAD closures and catch retention
WCPFC6,263,"Kiribati, on behalf of PNA members, presented a proposal (WCPFC6-2009/DP14) that would apply PNA provisions for FAD closures and catch retention to the high seas in the area between 20o N and 20oS where FAD closures and catch retention by purse-seine vessels are called for under CMM 2008-01."
WCPFC6,264,"Some CCMs raised questions or concerns about the PNA provisions, including the definition of FADs, which covers living marine organisms and the term ―unfit for human consumption‖; and the specification of seven-day and 50-mile buffers during the FAD closure."
WCPFC6,265,One CCM suggested that rather than attempting to define ―unfit for human consumption‖ that para. 27(b) of CMM 2008-01 be deleted.
WCPFC6,266,One CCM suggested waiting until more information is available on the 2009 FAD closure from observer reports before agreeing on detailed rules.
WCPFC6,267,"PNA members noted that the proposal represents a potential extension to the high seas of rules, which are already applicable inside PNA waters and which contain the majority of tropical tuna catches. These CCMs stated that if compatibility is to be ensured, the high seas rules should conform to the PNA rules. It was also pointed out that compatibility of rules will benefit the ROP."
WCPFC6,268,"One CCM, supported by several others, stated a preference for a seasonal closure of the entire purse-seine fishery rather than just a seasonal FAD closure."
WCPFC6,269,"One CCM explained that because these PNA rules were in some cases different to the specifications in CMM 2008-01, which had formed the basis for national legislation now being implemented, it would be difficult to adopt new rules at this point."
WCPFC6,270,"After an initial discussion, most CCMs supported initial implementation of the proposal on an interim basis with a full review after one year."
WCPFC6,271,WCPFC adopted the PNA’s proposal for FAD closure and catch retention rules on the high seas as contained in WCPFC6-2009/DP14 as a CMM (CMM 2009-02 FAD Closure 34  and Catch Retention) (Attachment Y). The measure is to be reviewed by TCC6 and the results reported back to WCPFC7 for further consideration.
WCPFC6,272,"On the understanding that some CCMs’ domestic regulations are compatible with, but not identical to, the PNA rules, and that those CCMs will submit copies of these regulations to the WCPFC Secretariat prior to the 2010 FAD closure, WCPFC6 agreed to permit some flexibility in the implementation of the measure for 2010 for those CCMs.    Japan‘s port monitoring, capacity reduction and purse-seine fleet growth papers"
WCPFC6,273,"Japan presented WCPFC6-2009/IP19 on port monitoring experience in Japan, WCPFC6-2009/IP20 on the scrapping of 87 Japanese longliners, and WCPFC6-2009/IP21on growth of the WCPO purse-seine fleet by several Members."
WCPFC6,274,WCPFC6 noted the papers. The issue of Japan‘s port monitoring is further discussed under Agenda Item 9.4.    Proposal for a CMM on banning FAD sets at night during the FAD closure period
WCPFC6,275,Korea introduced a proposal to ban purse-seine sets between midnight and sunrise local time during the FAD closure. The motivation for the proposal was a finding presented at SC5 that 95% of FAD sets occurred before sunrise but only 3% of unassociated sets occurred before sunrise. Korea stated that banning purse-seine sets at night during the FAD closure would strengthen implementation of the closure.
WCPFC6,276,"Three CCMs commented that because FAD sets are already banned during the FAD closure period, the imposition of a ban on FAD sets is duplicative and unnecessary. One of these CCMs suggested that the definition of ―sunrise local time‖ could be problematic."
WCPFC6,277,Two CCMs stated that the proposal was appealing and worthy of further consideration.
WCPFC6,278,Korea agreed to elaborate the proposal for further discussion at SC6.   f. CMM 2008-03 Sea Turtles
WCPFC6,279,"Australia requested WCPFC6‘s approval of its sea turtle mitigation plan (WCPFC6-2009/IP16) as required under CMM 2008-03, noting that both SC and TCC had recommended Commission approval of the plan."
WCPFC6,280,WCPFC6 approved Australia’s sea turtle mitigation plan (WCPFC6-2009/IP16).   g. CMM 2008-05 Swordfish
WCPFC6,281,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, presented WCPFC6-2009/DP09 (Rev. 1) containing a proposal to amend CMM 2008-05 concerning swordfish. The proposal is in response to a requirement under CMM 2008-05 that the Commission review the measure at WCPFC6."
WCPFC6,282,"The EU reported that it had provided a report on an audit of its swordfish data to the Executive Director, and that SPC has taken account of the information. Other information has also been provided, including bilaterally. The EU thus considers that all outstanding issues from WCPFC5 have been settled.   35"
WCPFC6,283,Chinese Taipei requested that the data on vessels smaller than 100 GRT in Annex 1 of the proposed CMM be adjusted to reflect a new figure provided by Chinese Taipei of a total of 84 vessels in 2003.
WCPFC6,284,Two CCMs requested that the date of review of the measure be moved forward from 2012 to 2011.
WCPFC6,285,"With incorporation of the above two changes, WCPFC6 adopted WCPFC6-2009/DP09 (Rev. 1) as a new CMM for swordfish (CMM 2009-03 Swordfish) (Attachment Z).   h. CMM 2008-06 Sharks"
WCPFC6,286,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC6-2009/IP14, which on the basis of recommendations from SC5 and NC5, incorporates silky shark in the list of key shark species in CMM 2008-06."
WCPFC6,287,Australia suggested that WCPFC6 task SC6 with the following: a. Consider adding porbeagle to the list of key shark species on the basis that it is a CMS Appendix II species;  b. Consider information contained in the Pacific Islands Regional Plan of Action for Sharks (WCPFC6-2009/IP13); c. Review the list of shark species identified for stock assessment and for annual reporting by CCMs to ensure it includes species at highest risk; and  d. requested that WCPFC7 review the shark measure taking into account the Kobe2 bycatch workshop to be held in 2010.
WCPFC6,288,Japan suggested that hammerheads and porbeagle also be reviewed by SC6 for possible inclusion in the list of key shark species.
WCPFC6,289,Palau informed WCPFC6 that it has established the world‘s first nationwide shark sanctuary and encouraged other CCMs to join in efforts to assess and manage shark species and work toward their conservation (Attachment AA).
WCPFC6,290,WCPFC6 adopted a revised CMM to include the silky shark as a key shark species in CMM 2008-06 (CMM 2009-04) (Attachment BB) and the suggestions by Australia and Japan to task SC6 and WCPFC7 with the above items concerning shark stocks.   9.2 Report by PNA members on the implementation of the vessel day scheme
WCPFC6,291,"Kiribati, on behalf of PNA members, presented a report on the vessel day scheme (VDS), which has now been in operation for just over two years (WCPFC6-2009/DP21). For the first Management Year (1 December 2007 to 30 November 2008) 31,431 days were used and for the second Management Year (partial period:  1 January to 31 October 2009, 11 months) 30,029 days were used."
WCPFC6,292,One CCM asked for more detail on the operation of the scheme to be provided in future reports.
WCPFC6,293,"Kiribati, on behalf of PNA, noted the request.   36  9.3 Response to the Commission’s request in respect of a high seas VDS"
WCPFC6,294,"The Secretariat prepared WCPFC6-2009/17 in response to the requirement of CMM 2008-01, para. 21 for the Commission to consider development of a VDS for the high seas, which would be compatible with the PNA VDS. Efforts by the Philippines to provide catch and effort data for the high seas were acknowledged. Because no substantive comments on the issue were provided by SC5 or TCC5, the Commission was invited to consider recommendations for any further work necessary for a high seas VDS in 2010."
WCPFC6,295,"WCPFC6 noted WPCFC6-2009/17, which was on the development of a high seas VDS.   9.4 Consideration of new measures and other conservation requirements a. Data buoys"
WCPFC6,296,"The USA introduced WPCFC6-2009/DP01 concerning a new CMM on data buoys. This CMM was discussed at TCC5, which recommended forwarding it to WCPFC6. The USA noted a recent United Nations General Assembly resolution to protect ocean data buoys, and the fact that half of all buoy arrays are out of service due to damage."
WCPFC6,297,Several CCMs expressed concerns regarding how fishermen can be made aware of the location of data buoys and how they can distinguish between data buoys and other floating objects. These CCMs requested that the Secretariat provide links to further information about data buoys on the WCPFC website.
WCPFC6,298,"Some CCM suggested that standard marking be required for data buoys, particularly non-governmental data buoys, but this was noted to be beyond the control of the Commission."
WCPFC6,299,Some CCMs suggested that the buffer area around the buoys be reduced from 1 nm to 500 nm on the basis that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) requires a 500 nm buffer around research facilities.
WCPFC6,300,"Other CCMs noted that data buoys are being used as FADs, therefore it is appropriate that a similar distance be maintained from data buoys as from any other object being used as a FAD (i.e. 1 nm)."
WCPFC6,301,"While supporting the measure, Australia noted it may need more time to implement it than current Commission timeframes allow but would do so as expeditiously as possible."
WCPFC6,302,"WPCFC6 adopted WCPFC6-2009/DP01, as revised, as a new CMM (2009-05) entitled ―Prohibition of Fishing Activities on Data Buoys‖ (Attachment CC).   b. Transhipment"
WCPFC6,303,RMI and Nauru presented WCPFC6-2009/DP03 containing a proposal for a CMM on transhipment. This proposal represents the outcome of extensive negotiations over several years but still contains a few outstanding issues for further discussion at WCPFC6.
WCPFC6,304,"Some CCMs advocated limiting the application of the measure to the Convention Area, suggesting that cross-endorsement of observers between IATTC and WCPFC would handle cases in which vessels cross from one Convention Area to the other in the eastern Pacific.   37"
WCPFC6,305,Some CCMs noted their general opposition to allowing transhipment on the high seas but stated their willingness to support the measure as a first step.
WCPFC6,306,Some CCMs expressed concern about special provisions for particular types of fisheries as provided for in the draft measure.
WCPFC6,307,"After further discussion in the margins of WCPFC6, Nauru and RMI produced WCPFC6-2009/DP03 (Rev. 2)."
WCPFC6,308,"Discussions continued regarding the provisions of the proposed text in WCPFC6-2009/DP03 (Rev. 2) resulting in the following revisions:    a. Although the implementation date for the new provisions is 1 July 2010 (para. 1), the effective date for para. 13(c) is 1 January 2011.   b. In para. 38, ―Members of the Commission‖ should be changed to ―Members of the Commission and participating territories‖.   c. Correction of minor cross-referencing errors in the text is necessary and will be done by the Secretariat."
WCPFC6,309,"On the understanding that the above points a, e, and f will be reflected in the measure, WCPFC6 adopted the text in WCPFC-2009/DP03 (Rev. 2) as a new conservation and management measure (CMM 2009-06 Regulation on Transhipment) (Attachment DD)."
WCPFC6,310,"WCPFC6 was also noted that:  a. the conclusion of data exchange and observer cross-endorsement procedures with IATTC is considered critical for smooth and effective implementation of this measure;   b. as required under PNA arrangements, all vessels in PNA waters are required to carry PNA observers, and PNA observers can serve on the high seas if they have been authorized under the Regional Observer Programme; and   c. the provisions in para. 13 apply throughout the Convention Area."
WCPFC6,311," The EU stated its understanding that, as agreed at WCPFC5, until provisions for cross-endorsement of observers are agreed between WCPFC and IATTC, vessels crossing from the IATTC Convention Area into the WCPFC Convention Area will take a WCPFC observer at the first entry into port within the WCPFC Convention Area."
WCPFC6,312,"Vanuatu stated that it supports the proposal but has some reservations concerning the effect of the proposal on Vanuatu‘s existing transhipment operations in the high seas pocket between Vanuatu, Fiji and Solomon Islands. Vanuatu stated that given the importance of transhipment in this high seas pocket to its industry, it wished to reserve the right to object to renewal of this measure when it is next considered by the Commission."
WCPFC6,313,China agreed to work with the Secretariat on proposals for cost recovery from other RFMOs who use WCPFC observers and to ensure that all appropriate procedures are in place for the smooth implementation of the measure in 2011.
WCPFC6,314,"WCPFC6 approved a proposal by the USA for an addendum to the monitoring, control and surveillance data provision rules regarding the treatment of transhipment data (WCPFC6-2009/DP34) (see Attachment EE).   38  c. Port monitoring"
WCPFC6,315,"In accordance with para. 43 of CMM 2008-01, Japan presented WCPFC6-2009/DP05 (Rev. 2) describing port sampling and monitoring of purse-seine catches to determine species composition. The findings of the studies indicated that even for those vessels with observers, only 77% of the purse-seine bigeye tuna bycatch is reported. Based on this finding, Japan advocated greater efforts toward port sampling by CCMs, including monitoring of canneries in Bangkok, which take most of the purse-seine catches, and other high volume transhipment ports. Japan considers these types of programmes essential in documenting catches, thereby avoiding allegations that the fish are products of IUU (particularly unreported) fishing activities."
WCPFC6,316,"One CCM requested more details on Japan‘s port sampling protocols, including minimum sample sizes and sampling of split catches. This CCM requested Japan to develop a training programme for other CCMs on sampling methodologies."
WCPFC6,317,Japan agreed to host a symposium or workshop on the subject in 2010 to consider the possible establishment in 2010 of an arrangement with non-CCMs to enable the collection of species and size composition data from canneries in non-CCM ports. Progress with this work will be reported to the 2010 annual session of the Commission.
WCPFC6,318,Some CCMs supported immediate implementation of Japan‘s proposals.
WCPFC6,319,"Several CCMs, including FFA members, welcomed the information provided by the port sampling and noted that it can assist in reducing uncertainty. However, these CCMs requested more time to consider the proposals and their linkages to other instruments such as port State measures, transhipment, catch documentation schemes and the EU IUU regulation; and to consult with Thailand."
WCPFC6,320,"The USA noted that its decades-long port sampling programme for both purse seiners and longliners in American Samoa might serve as a good model in that it contains elements such as stratified sampling, accounting for at-sea sample sorting bias, and at-sea spill sampling. The USA recommended that this programme, along with others, be reviewed by SC and TCC before adopting a WCPFC port sampling programme."
WCPFC6,321,"As a compromise, Japan asked for endorsement to proceed with a cannery sampling programme in Thailand."
WCPFC6,322,"WCPFC6 adopted an abbreviated form of the proposal calling for a cannery sampling programme to be initiated (WCPFC6-2009/DP05 (Rev. 3), CMM 2009-10) (Attachment FF). WCPFC6 recognized the importance of port sampling for species composition and called for the issue to be further progressed through the SC and TCC.   d. North Pacific albacore"
WCPFC6,323,Further consideration of this measure was deferred until 2010 (see para. 211). e. Pacific bluefin tuna
WCPFC6,324,"The Chair of the NC presented a draft CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna (WCPFC6-2009/DP07) (see Agenda Item 5.1). The measure provides for holding fishing effort to levels no greater than the 2002–2004 levels for 2010, with the Korean EEZ being exempt from this measure.   39"
WCPFC6,325,"While welcoming a CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna, some CCMs expressed concerns about the exemption of the Korean EEZ from the measure and urged the NC to work toward applying the measure throughout the entire area north of 20oN from 2011 onward."
WCPFC6,326,One CCM questioned the definition of ―artisanal fisheries‖ and ―2002–2004‖ level.
WCPFC6,327,"Tokelau, on behalf of FFA members, requested that the NC continue to monitor fishing mortality on age 1–3 fish as this is of particular concern."
WCPFC6,328,WCPFC6 adopted WCPFC6-2009/DP07 as a new CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna for 2010 (CMM 2009-7) with the request of CCMs that the measure also apply to the Korean EEZ after 1January 2011 (Attachment GG).   f. North Pacific striped marlin
WCPFC6,329,"Efforts in the margins of WCPFC6, led by the USA, progressed a draft CMM for striped marlin in the North Pacific through four versions but did not reach agreement (WCPFC6-2009/24 [Rev. 4])."
WCPFC6,330,WCPFC6 agreed that further work to develop a CMM for North Pacific striped marlin should be discussed at WCPFC7.   g. Chartering notification scheme
WCPFC6,331,"Fiji, on behalf of FFA members, presented a draft CMM on chartering notification arrangements (WCPFC6-2009/DP08). This draft had been discussed at TCC5 and was subsequently subject to some minor amendments.  FFA members supported the current draft text."
WCPFC6,332,Several CCMs called for a requirement within the draft measure for notification of the flag State when charter arrangements are entered into.
WCPFC6,333,FFA members explained that the charter arrangements are business partnerships that cannot be regulated. Concerns were also expressed that flag State notification could be abused with the end result being that the development of SIDS is restricted.
WCPFC6,334,"Dr Tsamenyi advised  that the purpose of the charter notification scheme is not to address the process of chartering vessels, which is regulated by flag State laws and subject to commercial negotiation among the parties, but to promote transparency in the use of charters by requiring notification of specified information to the Commission."
WCPFC6,335,The USA highlighted catch attribution under charter arrangements and flag States/chartering member responsibilities over the chartered vessels and offered to produce a paper on this topic for consideration at TCC6.
WCPFC6,336,"Through further discussion in the margins of WCPFC6 and across the floor, CCMs agreed to modify the draft text to include a requirement for the Executive Director to immediately notify the flag State once the charter notification is received. An expiry date of 31 December 2011, with an option to renew, was also inserted to the text."
WCPFC6,337,WCPFC6 adopted the new CMM on charter arrangements (CMM 2009-008 Charter Notification Scheme) (Attachment HH) 40
WCPFC6,338,"Fiji, on behalf of FFA members, stated that nothing in the measure should be considered to provide any basis for flag States to interfere in charter arrangements between SIDS and their vessels.   h. Stateless vessels"
WCPFC6,339,"The USA presented WCPFC6-2009/DP15 (Rev. 1) containing a proposal for a new CMM on Stateless vessels, which had been discussed at TCC5 and forwarded to WCPFC6 for consideration. The USA explained that para. 5 had been deleted in the revision because the high seas boarding and inspection measure, and provisions it contained, were already authorized under UNCLOS."
WCPFC6,340,"WCPFC adopted the Stateless vessels proposal (WCPFC6-2009/DP15 [Rev. 1]) as a new CMM (CMM 2009-09, Vessels without nationality) (Attachment II)."
WCPFC6,341,"On the adoption of this CMM, Chinese Taipei stated its understanding of the CMM as follows: a. “A vessel not flying the flag of their flag State” should be defined as those vessels that refuse to show their flag; and b. Vessels not registered on the shipping registry of a State should be regarded as vessels without nationality unless the circumstances as envisaged in Article 6(2) the 1958 High Seas Convention or Article 92(2) of the 1982 UNCLOS are fulfilled.  i. Control of nationals"
WCPFC6,342,"New Zealand submitted WCPFC6-2009/DP16 to provide an update on the process of developing a CMM on the control of nationals. Comments on a draft CMM prepared by New Zealand were received from Japan, Chinese Taipei and the PNA."
WCPFC6,343,"Tuvalu, on behalf of FFA members, expressed concern that the measure not be used to prevent development of SIDS‘ domestic fisheries."
WCPFC6,344,"Given that the issues raised in these comments were substantive, New Zealand offered to work with CCMs in the coming months to prepare a revised draft CMM for consideration at TCC6. j. Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures Working Group"
WCPFC6,345,"Australia presented (WCPFC6-2009/DP17), which contains draft terms of reference for the Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures (CCMM) Working Group. It is proposed that the working group develop compliance monitoring structures and processes for consideration by the Commission, and represent the results of three previous submissions to the Commission."
WCPFC6,346,"Several CCMs spoke in support of efforts to form a CCMM Working Group, but none of them favored an intersessional meeting. Some of these CCMs suggested a special session be held during TCC6 to advance discussions on this topic, whereas others supported electronic intersessional discussions prior to TCC6."
WCPFC6,347,One CCM recommended deletion of the last portion of para. 4 of the Terms of Reference regarding a non-compliant party blocking punitive action.   41
WCPFC6,348,Some CCMs stated that they support the CCMM Working Group only as subsidiary body to the TCC.
WCPFC6,349,WCPFC approved Australia’s proposal to convene discussions on the formation of a CCMM Working Group in accordance with the terms of reference in WCPFC6-2009/DP17.   k. Port State measures
WCPFC6,350,The EU presented WCPFC6-2009/DP19 on implementing the minimum technical standards of the new FAO Port State Measures Agreement within the WCPFC.
WCPFC6,351,"Fiji, on behalf of FFA members, expressed support for the FAO Port State Measures Agreement but noted that FFA standards are stricter than those in the agreement and will be applied if appropriate. FFA members are concerned that there is no transfer of the burden of combating IUU fishing to SIDS."
WCPFC6,352,"WCPFC6 noted that implementing the provisions of the Port State Measures Agreement is a priority for the Commission, and decided that the matter be progressed through electronic means for further discussion at TCC6."
WCPFC6,353,Parties were invited to submit a first round of comments on the EU proposal to the Secretariat by 1 March 2010. The EU will soon thereafter circulate a revised proposal on which Parties will be invited to comment before 1 June 2010. The EU will thereafter further revise the proposal and present it to TCC6. l. Draft CMM on aspirations for developing states
WCPFC6,354,A draft CMM on aspirations for developing States (WCPFC6-2009/DP24) tabled by RMI was withdrawn.  m. Kobe matrix
WCPFC6,355,"Canada introduced WCPFC6-2009/DP31, presenting a strategy matrix that can serve as a harmonized format for standardizing scientific advice, and a first step toward depicting stock status against reference points to clearly communicate risk. It was noted that the concept was presented at and endorsed by the Kobe2 meeting. The paper contains a proposal for a pilot project applying the matrix within the WCPFC as workloads allow (i.e. probably in 2011)."
WCPFC6,356,WCPFC6 tasked the management objectives workshop with determining the elements of the matrix with subsequent forwarding of the material to SC7 (2011) for further consideration.   n. NGO information for compliance
WCPFC6,357,"Canada presented WCPFC6-2009/DP33, concerning procedures for the submission and actioning of reports from non-governmental organizations on non-compliance with the Commission‘s CMMs."
WCPFC6,358,"Due to time constraints, WCPFC6 was unable to discuss this issue and it was referred to TCC6 for further consideration.   42  AGENDA  ITEM  10  -  ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION"
WCPFC6,359,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC6-2009/19, which presents a profile of the Commission‘s work during 2009. The report summarizes the work of the WCPFC subsidiary bodies, the Secretariat, contracts and consultancies, relations with other organizations and emerging issues. An annex details the progress in implementing the functions of the Commission as assessed by the Secretariat."
WCPFC6,360,WCPFC7 took note of the report and the WCPFC Chair expressed his particular appreciation for the dedication of the Secretariat staff.   AGENDA  ITEM  11  -  REPORT OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE
WCPFC6,361,"The Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC), Ambassador Terry Toomata (Samoa), presented the report of FAC3 (WCPFC6-2009/27) (Attachment JJ).  Highlights of the report included a likely cash flow problem for the Commission resulting from extra-budgetary VMS expenses; preparation of a draft Strategic Plan; appointment of a new Executive Director; new rules for contributions from those CCMs fishing in the area of overlap between the WCPFC and IATTC Convention areas; and the proposed budget for 2010 and indicative budgets for 2011 and 2012. The FAC Chair noted that the proposed 2010 budget has been reduced through cost cutting to US$ 5.4 million, and thanked New Caledonia for its generous, voluntary contribution of €115,000 to the Regional Observer Programme (ROP) Support Fund, and offer to explore means to provide ongoing support (WCPFC6-2009/DP39).  Nevertheless, undesirable budget cuts still needed to be made and it was recommended that a cost recovery study be undertaken to identify means of gathering additional funds for the work of the Commission, for example, through cost recovery for air time costs associated with the Commission VMS, financial contributions from CNMs and/or a registration charge for observer delegations."
WCPFC6,362,New Caledonia sought explicit confirmation of the decision to implement Option 5.1 for ROP data management (WPCFC6-2009/IP-08; also see Agenda Item 7).
WCPFC6,363,"Several CCMs, noting a previously stated and clear preference for Option 5.3 in relation to ROP data management (see Agenda Item 7), agreed to accept Option 5.1 for an initial one-year period."
WCPFC6,364,"Several CCMs stated that, given the limited time available for review, it would be inappropriate to include the Strategic Plan as part of the endorsement of the report of FAC3."
WCPFC6,365,Two CCMs suggested that if any surplus funding becomes available that the ROP should be allocated the additional funds as observer data is critical to robust scientific and management advice.
WCPFC6,366,Two CCMs and the WCPFC Chair suggested that surplus funding should be allocated to rapporteuring services because it is an important element of meeting support that cannot be provided by Secretariat staff without compromising other Secretariat services to the meeting.
WCPFC6,367,"The Executive Director clarified that security concerns have recently been heightened at Pohnpei, thus requiring some security expenditures by the Commission. He explained that a Commission contribution to some projects has been necessary to leverage large amounts of donor 43  funds; these funds can be shown in future budget spreadsheets as income from other sources. In response to concerns raised regarding the extra-budgetary VMS costs, the Executive Director noted that the additional cost was incurred because nearly double the forecast number of vessels had reported to the Commission‘s VMS in 2009. He also indicated that it was estimated that approximately 127 carriers and bunkers would be listed on the WCPFC RFV and charges accrued from those listings would be set aside in a special fund awaiting an allocation decision by the Commission at WCPFC7."
WCPFC6,368,"Noting that the Strategic Plan is a draft document requiring further consideration before Commission endorsement, WCPFC6 adopted the FAC3’s report, including the amended Commission Budget and Work Programme."
WCPFC6,369,"In response to the decision to appoint an interim Executive Director from within the existing Secretariat staff, the WCPFC Chair announced the appointment of Dr Sung-Kwon Soh.  It was noted that when assuming the duties of interim Executive Director, the Secretariat‘s capacity to service the 2010 meeting of the SC will be affected. CCMs were encouraged to consider secondments to fill this interim need."
WCPFC6,370,"FFA members announced that a workshop hosted by FFA on fisheries management arising from the Kobe2 joint tuna RFMO meeting, will be held from 29 June to 1 July 2010 in Brisbane, Australia. It was suggested that a special WCPFC meeting be held on Friday, 2 July 2010 to discuss applications for the Executive Director position.   AGENDA  ITEM  12  -  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES"
WCPFC6,371,"Tuvalu, on behalf of FFA members, made a statement reminding CCMs of the provisions of Resolution 2008-01, regarding cooperation of developed CCMs with SIDS and territories to increase the share of benefits from the fish stocks of the Convention Area received by SIDS and territories. Developed CCMs were encouraged to fully implement Resolution 2008-01 in accordance with Article 30 of the Convention and as called for by agreed immediate action (j) at the Kobe2 meeting."
WCPFC6,372,"RMI, also on behalf of FFA members, noted with regret that SIDS-supported proposals on revising the IUU listing/de-listing procedures and on development aspirations had not been supported by some CCMs. These and other experiences were causing concern among SIDS that constraints to their development were ongoing and increasing. While acknowledging with sincere appreciation the receipt of financial and in-kind contributions, RMI, on behalf of FFA members, urged developed CCMs to take the opportunity to inform the Commission of their implementation of Article 30 of the Convention."
WCPFC6,373,"Kiribati, supporting the statements of Tuvalu and RMI, noted that during WCPFC5 it had taken difficult decisions to continue to support arrangements that it considered impinged on their sovereign rights with regard to licensing. Kiribati expressed great concern regarding an incident in which one of its joint ventures has been blocked by the actions of another CCM, and stated that such situations were unacceptable impediments to SIDS‘ development aspirations."
WCPFC6,374,"Samoa supported the statements by FFA members, and recognized assistance from the USA under the special requirements fund, from Japan under the Japan Trust Fund, and other development assistance being provided by China.    44"
WCPFC6,375,New Zealand stated that this issue warranted a high priority on the agenda of future Commission meetings and urged CCMs to report to the Commission on their implementation of Article 30 of the Convention.
WCPFC6,376,Papua New Guinea supported the views of other SIDS and noted the progress being made by the PNA on developing management measures for PNA waters.
WCPFC6,377,"The EU stated that the development of coastal States is a priority for the EU, as witnessed by the European Development Fund contributions to the region, particularly with regard to combating IUU fishing."
WCPFC6,378,"The USA highlighted its shiprider agreements with six SIDS and territories: Cook Islands, FSM, Kiribati, RMI, Palau and Tonga, as well as their recent cooperative enforcement exercises (Operations Bigeye and Island Chief), which resulted in the detection of a number of fisheries management infractions."
WCPFC6,379,Japan restated its view that it will be necessary for developed CCMs to find a real mechanism for transferring capacity to developing countries and ensuring that real benefit accrues to SIDS rather than to irresponsible foreign investors.
WCPFC6,380,France noted their commitment to combating IUU fishing activities.
WCPFC6,381,"The WCPFC Chair, noting the proposal by FFA members (see Agenda 7.1 [a]), suggested that a separate item be added to the agenda of future meetings to allow developed CMMs to report to the Commission on their implementation of Article 30.   AGENDA  ITEM  13  -  COOPERATION WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS"
WCPFC6,382,"WCPFC6 was invited to consider four memoranda of understanding: revisions to the existing memoranda of understanding with the SPC-OFP, ISC, and IATTC and a proposed new memorandum of understanding with the North Pacific Anadromous Fisheries Commission (NPAFC), respectively as contained in WCPFC6-2009/22."
WCPFC6,383,"WCPFC approved the draft MOU between WCPFC and SPC-OFP, which is contained in WCPFC6-2009/22, Attachment A (see Attachment KK to this report)."
WCPFC6,384,"With regard to the MOU between the WCPFC and ISC, WCPFC6 agreed to retain the existing MOU without amendment until review at WCPFC7."
WCPFC6,385,"Further discussions in the margins of WCPFC6 led by the EU produced text addressing the issue in paragraph 1(c) of the draft Memorandum on Cooperation (MOC) on the Exchange and Release of Data between WCPFC and IATTC (WCPFC6-2009/22, Attachment D)."
WCPFC6,386,"The USA proposed adding ―inter alia‖ before the list of ―mammals, turtles, sharks and billfish‖ in para. 2 of the draft MOC."
WCPFC6,387,WCPFC6 approved the data exchange arrangement with IATTC (Attachment LL).
WCPFC6,388,"Concerning the MOU between WCPFC and NPAFC, the Executive Director noted that NPAFC has requested additional time to review the document, and suggested that the issue be revisited at TCC6.   45"
WCPFC6,389,WCPFC6 agreed to further consider the MOU with NPAFC after receipt of comments from NPAFC.   AGENDA  ITEM  14  -  WORK PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2010 AND INDICATIVE WORK PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2011 AND 2012
WCPFC6,390,"The WCPFC Chair listed the following accomplishments of WCPFC6: a. updating of the IUU vessel list; b. approval of CNM applications and new procedures; c. improvements to the RFV (carriers and bunkers); d. agreement to apply the Kobe2 strategy matrix; e. agreement of a definition for a FAD set; and f. new CMMs on chartering, transhipment, South Pacific swordfish, Pacific bluefin, data buoys and stateless vessels."
WCPFC6,391,"While recognizing that the degree of priority will vary among CCMs, the priorities for the Commission, SC and TCC were identified by the WCPFC Chair for CCMs‘ consideration as follows: a. WCPFC7 i. reducing mortality of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna; ii. working on development of management objectives;  iii. compliance monitoring;  iv. implementing Article 30 of the Convention; and  v. the strategic plan and budgeting.    b. SC6 i. stock assessments for skipjack and bigeye tuna, and advice on management options;  ii. ongoing assessment of CMM 2008-01;  iii. purse-seine species composition research;  iv. shark stock assessments,  v. data and data gaps including port monitoring; and  vi. a draft CMM for striped marlin in the North Pacific.    c. NC6 i. updates to CMMs for Pacific bluefin tuna and North Pacific albacore; and  ii. implementing the ROP.   46   d. TCC6 i. implementing CMM 2008-01, including a high seas VDS;  ii. port sampling;  iii. implementing effective port State measures under the November 2009 FAO binding agreement on port state measures to combat IUU fishing;  iv. further work on monitoring compliance with CMMs;  v. reviewing the ROP and VMS programmes, including cost recovery;  vi. developing a catch documentation scheme;  vii. further discussing IUU provisions regarding ownership (3j), 120 days submission deadline and criteria for satisfactory settlement; and  viii. best practice in seabird mitigation measures.   AGENDA  ITEM  15  -  ELECTION OF OFFICERS"
WCPFC6,392,WCPFC6 approved the nominations by SC5 and TCC6 for the following officers:  Noan Pakop (Papua New Guinea) as Chair of the TCC; Dr Charles Karnella (USA) as Vice-Chair of the TCC; and Pamela Maru (Cook Islands) as Vice-Chair of the SC.   AGENDA  ITEM  16  -  OTHER MATTERS 16.1 Performance review
WCPFC6,393,"WCPFC6 noted that because there is no budget for a performance review to be undertaken in 2010, the review will need to be postponed for future consideration.   16.2 Extension of VMS to waters under national jurisdiction"
WCPFC6,394,"Under Article 24(8) of the Convention, any Commission Member may request that waters under its national jurisdiction be included within the area covered by the Commission VMS.  WCPFC6 was invited to consider the proposed application of the Commission VMS by a CCM wishing to obtain position information for a vessel inside its waters under national jurisdiction that is not part of its national VMS."
WCPFC6,395,"WCPFC6 agreed that this was essentially a bilateral issue between the CCM and the Secretariat, and that an agreement to extend the VMS to waters under national jurisdiction in this case in no way undermines the exclusive control of coastal States over their national waters.   16.3 WCPFC5 Summary Report"
WCPFC6,396,"PNG expressed grave disappointment in the WCPFC Secretariat in allowing certain CCMs to manipulate the opinion of the WCPFC Legal Advisor regarding the application of the Commission‘s CMMs to archipelagic and internal waters, and changing the initial draft of the WCPFC5 Summary Report, as it was further noted that the Commission‘s area of competence is the EEZs and the high seas, not territorial seas and archipelagic waters, quoting Article 56 of UNCLOS.    47"
WCPFC6,397,"The WCPFC Chair agreed that the issue of application of CMMs to support sustainable use of the stock throughout their range remained open for discussion. The Chair also noted that the purpose of the Convention is to establish a framework for cooperation between coastal States‘ management and high seas management, and to harmonize the interests of all parties while implementing best practices."
WCPFC6,398,"There was consensus that CMMs are required in both EEZs and high seas waters, and that these should be compatible in order to effectively manage fisheries resources throughout their range for sustainable benefit.   AGENDA  ITEM  17  -  NEXT MEETING"
WCPFC6,399,"FSM confirmed its interest in holding WCPFC7 in Palikir, Pohnpei State, Federated States of Micronesia, noting the standing arrangements for the Commission sessions to be held at Pohnpei every other year."
WCPFC6,400,"The Chair of the FAC reminded CCMs that since the Secretariat‘s budget for 2010 has been reduced, support for Commission meetings held in Pohnpei that has in the past been provided by the Secretariat (e.g. hospitality, transport, supplemental staffing) may require support from other CCMs."
WCPFC6,401,"Provisional dates for the 2010 meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies are as follows: a. SC6: Nuku‘alofa, Tonga (9–20 August 2010) b. NC6: (to be confirmed), Japan (8–11 September 2010) c. TCC6: Pohnpei, FSM (30 September–5 October 2010) d. FAC4: Pohnpei, FSM (5 December 2010) e. WCPFC7: Pohnpei, FSM (6–11 December 2010)"
WCPFC6,402,Korea indicated its intention to offer to host either the TCC or the Commission meeting in Seoul or Cheju in either 2011 or 2012.
WCPFC6,403,"Japan requested that CCMs send officers involved in fisheries management to the Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) COP15 in Doha, Qatar in March 2011."
WCPFC6,404,"Two CCMs suggested the seating arrangements, rather than being alphabetical, be rotated from year to year."
WCPFC6,405,Subsidiary bodies were encouraged to format and present their reports so as to avoid duplication and spending time on issues that do not require discussion at Commission meetings.   AGENDA  ITEM  18  -  SUMMARY REPORT
WCPFC6,406,"A summary report was prepared by the rapporteur and the Secretariat, and circulated to CCMs for comment.   AGENDA  ITEM  19  -  CLOSE OF MEETING"
WCPFC6,407,"PNG made a closing statement, indicating its general satisfaction with the meeting outcomes, in particular agreements reached on carriers and bunkers, charters and multi-species 48  analysis with regard to reference points. However, concern was expressed about insufficient effort directed toward high seas area closures and support for the development aspirations of SIDS. Points regarding PNG‘s reservations on the granting of CNM participatory rights for 2010 were reiterated (see Agenda Item 2)."
WCPFC6,408,A closing statement by Greenpeace called for a closing of the two additional high seas pockets and for harnessing market information and consumer preferences to reinforce sustainable fisheries management. The Executive Director was thanked for his efforts.
WCPFC6,409,"Several CCMs expressed their sincere appreciation to the departing Executive Director, and to the Government of French Polynesia for hosting the meeting."
WCPFC6,410,"The Government of French Polynesia declared that it was an honor and a pleasure to host the meeting, in particular given the important transhipment agreement and the other improvements to CMMs that were decided at WCPFC6."
WCPFC6,411,"The WCPFC Chair thanked the Government of French Polynesia for their generous contributions to the work of the Commission at WCPFC6. He also expressed his appreciation to the Commission‘s Vice-Chair Sylvie LaPointe (Canada) and all of the outgoing and new officers of the Commission‘s subsidiary bodies. Secretariat staff, including Dr Martin Tsamenyi and Dr Shelley Clarke, were also thanked. The WCPFC Chair presented the Executive Director with a Tahitian to’ere as a token of appreciation for his energy, vision and dedication."

He thanked the Government of French Polynesia for their support for WCPFC6, and paid a special tribute to Compliance Manager Andrew Richards who is also leaving the Secretariat in early 2010 and who has been instrumental in supporting the activities of the TCC."
WCPFC6,413,"The Chair closed WCPFC6 at 19:55 on Friday, 11 December 2009."
WCPFC7,1,"The Seventh Regular Session of the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC7) took place from 6–10 December 2010 at Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.  The session was opened by the Chairman of the WCPFC, Ambassador Satya Nandan (Fiji)."

WCPFC7,11,The Chairman made an opening statement (Attachment D).  1.2 Adoption of agenda
WCPFC7,12,The agenda (WCPFC7-2010-02 (Rev. 1)) and associated programme of work (WCPFC-2010-04) were adopted (Attachment E).   1.3 Meeting arrangements
WCPFC7,13,"The WCPFC Executive Director, Glenn Hurry, reviewed the administrative arrangements and meeting schedule. Secretariat technical staff attending the meeting including Donald David, ROP Data Quality Officer, Glenn Jano, Compliance Officer; Lucille Martinez, Executive Assistant; Herolyn Movick, Office Manager; Peter Flewwelling, Compliance Manager; Ken Smithson, Finance and Administrative Manager; Dr SungKwon Soh, Science Manager; Karl Staisch, Observer Programme Coordinator, and Sam Taufao, IT Manager.

WCPFC7,14,"The Executive Director indicated that most action items had been addressed, and that any exceptions would be noted and addressed during the course of the meeting."
WCPFC7,15,"FSM, on behalf of FFA members, commented on para. 384 in the WCPFC6 report, which relates to the Commission noting that the WCPFC and ISC MOU is to be reviewed at WCPFC7.  On behalf of FFA members, they requested an opportunity to discuss the review of the WCPFC and ISC MOU, during agenda item 3.4.1 dealing with Cooperation with other organisations, and specifically when WP12 is considered."
WCPFC7,16,"Palau commented on behalf of FFA members regarding paragraph 395 in the WCPFC6 report, and specifically on access to Commission VMS information under Article 24(8), which FFA members continue to support; they indicated they would elaborate on this point later in the week."
WCPFC7,17,"Nauru commented on behalf of FFA members regarding paragraph 391 in the WCPFC6 report, and specifically on the responses to the Chairs priorities. Regarding SC6 priorities, FFA members drew CCM’s attention to the North Pacific striped marlin proposal from FFA members (WCPFC7-2010-DP-07). Regarding data gaps, they noted that there were constructive discussions during SC6 and TCC6 regarding data gaps and encouraging CCMs to fulfill their commitments and obligations to provide data, which are reflected in the strong recommendations in the TCC6 report encouraging CCMs to fulfill their obligations to provide data; they expressed the hope that the Commission would consider these positively. Regarding TCC6 priorities, FFA 7  members proposed to establish a working group and TORs on a Catch Documentation Scheme (WCPFC7-2010-DP-18). AGENDA  ITEM  2  -  MEMBERSHIP 2.1 Status of the Convention"
WCPFC7,18,"New Zealand, as the depository of the Convention, reported that no instrument of ratification or accession to the Convention had been received since WCFPC6 (WCPFC7-2010-08).  It noted that on (i) 28 January 2010, the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union advised that, as of 1 December 2009, the European Community has been replaced and succeeded by the European Union in respect of the Convention; and (ii) on 7 February 2010, the then-WCPFC Executive Director, on behalf of New Zealand as depositary, circulated notification of several corrections to the date of entry into force of the Convention for countries whose ratification or accession date fell within a calendar month that contains 31 days."
WCPFC7,19,Fiji thanked New Zealand for the update and requested clarification from Indonesia on the status of its internal ratification process.
WCPFC7,20,In a response to an inquiry Indonesia provided an update on the status of its internal Convention verification process. Indonesia confirmed their interest in becoming a member of the Commission and asked that the Legal Advisor visit to discuss the legal details and requirements with Indonesian officials.
WCPFC7,21,"Samoa requested clarification of the effective date of entry into force for parties to the Convention, noting apparent discrepancies between the effective date and the date of ratification among some CCMs. It was noted by the Chair that the Convention enters into force for parties 30 days after deposit of their articles of accession; New Zealand indicated it would investigate and provide clarification direct to Samoa. 2.2 Applications for Observer Status"
WCPFC7,22,"The Executive Director stated that the Secretariat had received eight applications for observer status. He advised that the following additions were made to the list of observers to the Commission: (i) Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK), Thailand, and Panama (all included for 2010 in accordance with their request to become a CNM); (ii) the Parties to the Nauru Agreement and the World Bank (both (included under their status as intergovernmental organisations); and (iii) Shark Advocates International, Hawaii Longline Association, and Environment Hawai’i (all were accepted as NGOs, following no receipt of objection from members within 20 days before the start of the session)."
WCPFC7,23,"Samoa inquired how future media accreditation was to be handled, given that Korea Munhawa TV Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) had been given special permission to film during some sessions of WCPFC7."
WCPFC7,24,"The Chair noted that under the Commission’s rules of procedure all meetings are open. Press representatives are asked to register. Problems may arise if media activities (e.g. taking photos or filming) disturbs the proceedings, but all meetings are open unless the Commission decides otherwise."
WCPFC7,25,"Kiribati spoke on behalf of FFA members, noting that they had previously submitted that observers should pay to participate in meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies, and that at WCPFC6 the FAC was invited to advise the Commission on the appropriateness and, if necessary, the level of observer registration fees in recognition of the growing number of observers and the costs incurred in catering for them at Commission meetings. FFA members also noted that the observer contribution scheme is included in the TOR of the Cost Recovery Study, 8  and that they look forward to working with other delegations on the appropriateness of the observer financial contribution, the categories of observers to which the contribution would apply and the respective amount(s)."
WCPFC7,26,"WCPFC7 noted the revised list of observers as presented by the Secretariat, and tasked the Secretariat with developing a proposal for media access.  2.3 Applications for cooperating non-member status"
WCPFC7,27,"Ten applications for CNM status were received by TCC6 for review, including renewal of status by Belize, Ecuador, El Salvador, Indonesia, Mexico, Senegal, and Vietnam and new applications for CNM status from Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Panama, and the Thailand; all except for Panama were considered by TCC6 in accordance with procedures specified in CMM 2009-11. The ED noted that all CNM applications, except that of Panama, were endorsed by TCC6 to the Commission subject to provision of additional data required by CMM 2009-11, as detailed in WCPFC7-010-10. The Secretariat received responses from 5; those responses were posted on the WCPFC website. The application from Panama was lodged in Spanish originally, but was subsequently lodged in English (following a communication from the Secretariat at the direction of TCC6); there was no recommendation from TCC on how to proceed regarding Panama’s initial (Spanish) application."
WCPFC7,28,Dr John Hampton (SPC Oceanic Fisheries Programme Manager) stated that the responses from CNM applicants indicate that they had provided most of the data that they could; many of the data gaps identified by TCC during its review occurred before the CNM applicants had comprehensive data collection mechanisms in place.
WCPFC7,29,"Several CCMs spoke on behalf of FFA members regarding their expectations of all CNM applicants, indicating that Paragraph 2 of CMM 2009-11 lists the expectations agreed to by the Commission for CNM applications. FFA members stressed that CMM 2009-11 clearly states that all applications should include commitments regarding high seas boarding and inspection acceptance and making a financial contribution similar to that made by members; if some of the explicit commitments that WCPFC has requested be provided are missing, the application is incomplete. It was further noted that fairness required that all participants in the fishery share in the costs of management and conserving the stocks. FFA members referenced working paper FAC4/14, which proposed a unique level of contributions for each CNM that reflects their circumstances, and is in general comparable to the contribution by the smallest Pacific Island members. FFA members noted that determining participatory rights for CNMs should be considered on a case-by-case basis for CNM applicants, in accordance with CMM 2009-11(12). They stressed that such determination was without prejudice to the sovereign rights of coastal States, and that limits placed on CNMs could not be used to constrain the domestic development of PICTs (CNMs represent development partners for many PICTs, and the Commission should not have a role in determining the nature of any bilateral relationship)."
WCPFC7,30,"The EU agreed that CNM applicants should respect the reporting requirements, while cautioning that requiring an excessive financial contribution from developing states could discourage their participation as CNMs. The EU underlined that RFMOs should be open to all those states that have stakes in the relevant fishery."
WCPFC7,31,"The Commission determined that, in accordance with provisions of the WCPF Convention and CMM 2005-2, CMM 2005-3, CMM 2006-04, CMM 2008-01 and CMM 2009-11, the following conditions apply to the participatory rights granted to all Cooperating Non-Members (CNMs) for fisheries in the high seas within the Convention Area:  i. All vessels will be equipped with the Commission’s vessel monitoring system (VMS), which shall be operational at all times while the vessels are in the Convention Area.  9  ii. The CNMs identified below (in paras 31–60) provide assurances that they will comply with all requests from Commission Members for information and documentation to investigate cases of possible illegal fishing.  iii. In addition, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under the national jurisdiction of other CCMs, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements. Such CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPF Convention and WCPFC CMMs. In addition, such CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV). CCMs shall ensure that CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant CMMs and provisions of the WCPF Convention. Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will be conditional on full compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, all CMMs and provisions of the WCPF Convention. CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the TCC."
WCPFC7,32,"WCPFC7 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Belize with the following participatory rights:   Belize Catches of bigeye tuna from Belize are limited to 803.25 mt, its average catch levels over the period of 2001–2004; catches of yellowfin tuna are limited to 2,000 mt; and its fishing activities are limited to:  a. Under CMM 2005-02 in accordance with paragraph 1, Belize is limited to the historical catch level for 2004 of two unique longliners in the Convention Area south of 20 degrees south latitude;  b. Under CMM 2005-03 Belize is limited to the 2005 level of five unique longliners in the Convention Area north of the equator; and  c. Under CMM 2006-04, Belize is limited to two unique longliners in the Convention Area south of 15 degrees south latitude."
WCPFC7,33,"Korea indicated that DPRK’s participation and cooperation as a CNM could be seen to have some positive aspects, with respect to transparency of fishing operations. However, before granting CNM status to DPRK, Korea urged CCMs to recall that DPRK had been involved in IUU practices in 2003 and 2004, when they allowed two IUU vessels to fly the DPRK flag; they were at that time on the CCAMLR IUU list. Korea expressed its doubt that DPRK could carry out CNM responsibilities, and noted that DPRK had also failed to provide full WCPFC fisheries data, despite being requested to do so. Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea"
WCPFC7,34,"The USA concurred that granting of CNM status was premature. It noted questions regarding the DPRK’s ability and willingness to follow through with respect to WCPFC-related commitments. It also noted additional IUU activities by DPRK vessels, some as recent as April 2008. The CCAMLR Secretariat has sought more information about these activities. Para 7 of CMM 2009-11 indicates that the Commission shall also consider information available from other RFMOs relating to non-members seeking CNM status, as well as data submitted by such non-members to the Commission in making a determination on a CNM application. The USA indicated it had little confidence that DPRK would follow through on its commitments.  10"
WCPFC7,35,"Australia noted it had a similar view to that expressed by Korea and the USA, noting particular concerns about DPRK’s willingness and ability to exercise flag State control. Australian patrol vessels have taken part in some IUU-related actions mentioned by the USA. CMM 2009-11, para. 3(c) notes that an applicant’s record of responding to any IUU actions by vessels flying its flag is one of the issues to be considered. Australia indicated that paras 3(c) and 7 of CMM 2009-11 have not been met by DPRK."
WCPFC7,36,WCPFC7 did not approve the application for CNM status by Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.
WCPFC7,37,"Noan Pakop (TCC6 Chair) indicated TCC6 recommended Ecuador for CNM status subject to additional information being provided. The Executive Director indicated that Ecuador responded to the Secretariat’s request for additional information by providing catch data for 2010, and by specifying its willingness to make voluntary financial contributions to the Commission and to accept high seas boarding and inspections. Dr John Hampton indicated that Ecuador had provided the necessary data for 2010, and had agreed to allow IATTC to provide any requested data in their possession to SPC. The Chair of IATTC confirmed IATTC’s willingness to cooperate with WCPFC and SPC in resolving any outstanding issues related to historical data.  Ecuador"
WCPFC7,38,"The USA indicated that it took a specific interest in the previous (2009) application from Ecuador. It indicated that SPC was still examining the data that had been received, and noted that according to the information in WCPFC7-2010-20, no annual report (Part 1 or 2) had been submitted. It raised this concern, and noted that while it would not block a renewal of the CNM application in 2010, it encouraged Ecuador to submit all required elements in a timely fashion in the future. The USA stressed that it would look at the issue closely in 2011, and might take a stronger position if compliance did not improve."
WCPFC7,39,"One CCM shared similar sentiments to those expressed by the USA and previously by FFA members, and inquired whether Ecuador had met VMS data requirements."
WCPFC7,40,"Ecuador indicated their willingness to accept boarding and inspection of their vessels, and to make a financial contribution in accordance with the decision to be taken by WCPFC7."
WCPFC7,41,WCPFC7 approved the application for CNM status by Ecuador with the following participatory rights:   The participatory rights of Ecuador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. Purse-seine vessels of Ecuador shall not fish on the high seas.
WCPFC7,42,"El Salvador indicated it has participated in the Commission for the last 3 years, and had supplied all requested data. Following TCC6 the Commission requested that El Salvador supply historical size data, but El Salvador noted a that the historical information was not available in the format required Data collection at the point of unloading began in November 2010, and that data will be provided in 2011. El Salvador explained its national laws prevented it from making an explicit commitment to providing a financial contribution as a non-member. El Salvador committed to providing a voluntary contribution as a CNM, and committed to making a regular financial contribution if invited to be a member. It asked for clarification regarding the process of becoming a full member, noting it had submitted previous requests to be considered for membership.  El Salvador"
WCPFC7,43,The Legal Adviser noted that Article 35(2) of the Convention regulates accession to the Convention by non-contracting parties. 11
WCPFC7,44,"Several CCMs expressed support for future consideration of El Salvador as a full member of the Commission, while noting the need to consider how such an invitation would be extended."
WCPFC7,45,WCPFC7 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by El Salvador with the following participatory rights:  The participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. The total level of effort by purse seine vessels of El Salvador vessels on the high seas shall not exceed 29 days.
WCPFC7,46,"WCPFC7 discussed Indonesia’s long history in the work of the Commission, its ongoing contributions and efforts with respect to data collection and provision, and the internal legal constraints it faces in contributing financially as a CNM. Indonesia"
WCPFC7,47,Indonesia indicated its intention to work with the Commission in resolving the issues that have prevented Indonesia from becoming a full Commission member.
WCPFC7,48,The Legal Advisor noted Indonesia’s special case status and its rights to become a Member whenever it wished due to its full participation in all meetings leading up to the establishment of the Commission and its long standing history of fishing in the Convention Area.
WCPFC7,49,"WCPFC7 approved Indonesia’s application for renewal of its CNM status with the following participatory rights:   Indonesia‘s fishing activities in the Convention Area are limited to a longline bigeye catch limit of 8,413 mt (less 20% or 6,730.4 mt) and purse-seine fishing on the high seas in the Convention Area is limited to 500 days."
WCPFC7,50,WCPFC7 encouraged Indonesia to apply compatible measures within its archipelagic waters given the significance of these waters for juvenile yellowfin and bigeye catch.
WCPFC7,51,"Indonesia noted that it is participating in the new Global Environment Facility (GEF) West Pacific East Asia Oceanic Fisheries Management (WPEA OFM) project and cooperating with the Commission, particularly in areas of data collection improvement. Indonesia expressed its appreciation to the Commission for the decision to renew its CNM status and reiterated its intention to become a full member of the Commission. Indonesia stated that, consistent with its position throughout the Multilateral High Level Conference (MHLC) and Preparatory Conference, it considers that WCPFC CMMs do not apply to archipelagic waters."
WCPFC7,52,"WCPFC7 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Mexico with the following participatory rights:  Mexico i. The participatory rights of Mexico for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. Purse seine vessels of Mexico shall not fish on the high seas. ii. Noting the need for cooperation with the work of the Northern Committee (NC), particularly in regard to Pacific bluefin tuna, Mexico is encouraged to participate in NC7 and is advised that future renewals of Mexico’s CNM status could be hampered by a continuing lack of participation in the work of the NC. iii. Mexican participation in the WCPO tuna fisheries may not begin until all requested information and commitments have been provided to the WPFC Secretariat in accordance with Commission requirements.  12"
WCPFC7,53,"Senegal indicated it had supplied all available data, and asked for a temporary exemption on supplying a financial contribution, particularly as Senegal did not fish during 2008–2010. Senegal indicated it would endeavor to supply all relevant data should it commence fishing operations in the Convention Area, and was investigating the Commission’s query regarding the catch ratio of swordfish and sharks. It requested that the participatory rights that apply to Senegal be modified to allow another vessel with the same characteristics to replace the Robaleira should that vessel not be operational.  Senegal"
WCPFC7,54,WCPFC7 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Senegal with the following participatory rights:  The participatory rights of Senegal for fishing in the WCPO are limited to one unique longline vessel (the Robaleira). This vessel may only target swordfish. WCPFC7 tasked the Secretariat to calculate the swordfish catch limits that would apply to Senegal pursuant to the swordfish measure (CMM 2009-03) and to circulate this to all CCMs.
WCPFC7,55,The Commission requested that Senegal state in writing that it would accept boarding and inspection on the high seas.
WCPFC7,56,"Vietnam indicated it does not fish in Convention Area, but is cooperating in providing the information and data requested by the Commission, will cooperate with boarding and inspection requests, and is ready to make a financial contribution if the Commission so decides.  Vietnam"
WCPFC7,57,"WCPFC7 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Vietnam with the following participatory rights:  Noting the need for cooperation between Vietnam and the Commission to achieve compatibility of fisheries management and conservation, WCPFC7 agreed to grant CNM status to Vietnam for 2011 on the understanding that CNM status would only relate to the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data and that Vietnam would require assistance in that regard. Vietnam has no participatory rights for fishing for highly migratory fish stocks in the high seas of the Convention Area."
WCPFC7,58,WCPFC7 approved the application for CNM status by Panama with the following participatory rights:  Panama The participatory rights of Panama in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.
WCPFC7,59,"Thailand indicated it was approached by the Commission in 2009 regarding cooperation with the WCPFC, in particular regarding cannery landing data. It was agreed that initial data would focus on bigeye tuna, and data on other species would be complied as possible. Thailand noted it could face some difficulty in compiling data from small packers and canneries, but that its two main canneries already submit voluntary information to all RFMOs, including the WCPFC. Thailand is still awaiting a submission from tuna packers regarding whether all data can be collected. Internal consultations regarding budgetary contributions are ongoing. Thailand"
WCPFC7,60,"The Chair noted that Thailand’s request for CNM status was unusual, in that the WCPFC approached Thailand seeking cooperation regarding data, and that the relationship benefits the WCPFC. WCPFC members expressed broad support for extension of CNM status to Thailand. 13  The EU noted that the provision of such key data should be facilitated by a Catch Documentation Scheme."
WCPFC7,61,"WCPFC7 approved the application for CNM status by Thailand with the following participatory rights:  Noting the need for cooperation between Thailand and the Commission and the commitment from Thailand to provide data from canneries located in Thailand to assist in the work of the Commission, WCPFC7 agreed to grant CNM status to Thailand for 2011 on the understanding that CNM status would only relate to the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data. Thailand has no participatory rights for fishing for highly migratory fish stocks in the high seas of the Convention Area. 2.3.1 Draft schedule of Contribution for CNMs"
WCPFC7,62,"WCPFC6 decided (in CMM 2009-11) to request contributions from CNMs, and tasked the Secretariat to make an estimate of their likely contributions if they were to contribute in accordance with para 2(g) of CMM 2009-11; the results were provided in WCPFC7-2010-FAC4/14 (Rev 1), which includes Thailand."
WCPFC7,63,"In reviewing the document the Chair noted there could be special circumstances in which the Commission may wish to dispense with the CNM contribution requirements.  He asked that the Commission consider this in its deliberations of CNM contributions, noting that such discretion was not possible under the proposal before WCPFC7."
WCPFC7,64,"The recommendations of FAC4 were presented in WCPFC7-2010-32 (Rev 1), and the following decision was taken by WCPFC7 (under Agenda Item 10):  i. all CNMs should make an annual contribution that is 50% of the amount that would be payable if the CNM was a member. This contribution formula is to be reviewed by the FAC in 2011.   ii. the Executive Director shall inform CNMs and Members of the level of their recommended and assessed contributions as soon as practicable after each Annual Session with the amounts payable within 60 days of receipt of that notification. Contributions received from CNMs are to be used to reduce the assessed contributions of Members in the year following receipt. AGENDA  ITEM  3  -  MEMBER REPORTS 3.1 Annual Reports by the CCMs"
WCPFC7,65,"The following members and participating territories provided statements: Marshall Islands (on behalf of the PNA, Attachment F), Nauru (Attachment G), New Caledonia (Attachment H), Niue (Attachment I), Papua New Guinea (Attachment J), Philippines (Attachment K), Tokelau (Attachment L), Tuvalu (Attachment M) and Vietnam (Attachment N).  3.2 Statements of Non-Members"
WCPFC7,66,The North Pacific Anadromous Fisheries Commission (Attachment O) and Greenpeace (Attachment P) also made statements. 3.3 Special requirements of Developing States
WCPFC7,67,"PNG spoke on behalf of FFA members, and in its role as the FFC Chair, and introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-10, which sets out the views of all 17 FFA members on the areas that capture the intent of Article 30 and Resolution 2008-01. PNG noted that in 2010 Pacific Leaders tasked 14  the regional agencies (FFA, SPC and the PNA) to explore options for optimising fisheries commercialisation to increase fisheries revenue beyond licensing fees, and highlighted the position of FFA members that the fleets of developed CCMs must be reduced or restructured so as to accommodate the aspirations of PICs to develop their own fisheries."
WCPFC7,68,"Niue continued the presentation by FFA members of WCPFC7-2010-DP-10, and stressed the ongoing need for SIDS to receive assistance from developed partners in support of conservation and management, and acknowledged appreciation for the funding and support currently received from developed partners, bilaterally, through the WCPFC and through regional institutions. Niue (i) indicated that short-term training and longer-term academic scholarships, particularly in the areas of stock assessment and fisheries science, remain an important priority; (ii) encouraged that funding to be provided to the Special Requirements Fund or from other funds to support possible funding shortfalls in the 2011 SPC stock assessment workshops for Pacific Islands scientists; and (iii) encouraged that attachment opportunities be provided to Pacific Island nationals with the WCPFC Secretariat, with regional agencies, and well-established national fisheries administrations/research agencies."
WCPFC7,69,"FSM, concluded the presentation by FFA members of WCPFC7-2010-DP-10, noting that the outcomes and discussions during the Kobe II Workshop on RFMO Management of tuna fisheries (hosted by FFA in June/July 2010) clearly articulate the importance of rights-based management as a means to address the interests of developing coastal States, particularly SIDS, in fisheries, including high seas fisheries. FSM noted that the Bellagio Framework for Sustainable Tuna Fisheries provides tuna RFMOs with examples of ways rights-based management can be used to accommodate the aspirations of SIDS while addressing overfishing and overcapacity, including through transfers of vessels and/or quotas, which could assist SIDS and other small economically vulnerable states in development of their fisheries. Transfers could be facilitated by issuing time-limited rights to current users that revert to developing coastal states on expiration; landing taxes or annual fees on current fishers; and property rights on the high seas that are allocated to developing coastal states where the corresponding use rights can be rented, leased or fished. FFA members also suggested that a Tuna Corporation (similar to the “Enterprise” established in UNCLOS for deep sea mining) could be established in which individual countries hold shares. The corporation would contract with the lowest cost fleets to capture the tuna quotas and distribute the rents among its “shareholders.” Zone-based management arrangements are being developed for longline fisheries to replace the current flag-based allocations. Rights-based regimes that first recognise the zone-based management arrangements, and secondly facilitate the participation of SIDS in high seas fisheries are priorities for FFA members, and will be considered in future CMMs."
WCPFC7,70,"The Marshall Islands noted that including the special requirements of developing states as a regular item on the agenda was a positive step, and indicated that all measures should always consider the needs of SIDS first; it indicated that there were no “historical fishing industry rights”. RMI thanked members for the assistance provided to it and looked forward to reports in 2011 that described real economic investments."
WCPFC7,71,"Solomon Islands voiced support for the statement made by Marshall Islands, noting that the development of national flag fishing fleets is an important aspiration of SIDS, and consistent with Resolution 2008-01, and article 30 of the Convention. Solomon Islands stated it will increase its nationally flagged and managed purse-seine fleet, and looked forward to the support and encouragement of its development partners."
WCPFC7,72,"Tuvalu expressed support for previous comments made by FFA members. Tuvalu thanked those who had contributed to the special requirement fund, and provided assistance with short-term training in stock assessment, data workshops, observer activities and other related training. 15  However, Tuvalu expressed concern with poor progress in implementing the special requirements for developing states to help foster domestic development, including through assistance and support to build and expand its domestic fleets and onshore development, pursuing realistic projects with significant economic impact, and crewing and certifications initiatives similar to that pursued by the PNA. Tuvalu also sought a long-term commitment by the Commission and developed CCMs to provide opportunities for Pacific Island scientists and fisheries managers to pursue relevant academic qualifications, internships and fellowships. Tuvalu noted its intent to expand its domestic operations through partnership arrangements and to increase its participation in both its in-zone and the high seas fisheries, including through acquisition of vessels from some CCMs."
WCPFC7,73,"Japan outlined the assistance it provides for SIDS, including through improvement of infrastructure of SIDS, for fisheries and other activities. During 2004–2008 Japan spent over $2 billion on assistance to Pacific Island states, including over $7 million in construction of fishing ports and markets in PNG and RMI, constructing a fishing port in Tuvalu, and fishery facilities in Kiribati. Japan noted that the construction would benefit all parties, and not just Japan, indicating a Chinese company was using a fishing port and airport Japan constructed in FSM. Japan noted that capacity-building efforts had involved some 200 experts over a 5-year period, and that experts were also involved in maintaining fishing vessels. In addition to providing fishing vessels, Japan provided promotional funds to FFA that can be used for international meeting attendance. Japan has also established a trust fund for the WCPFC. Japan expressed its intention to extend and intensify this type of cooperation for developing states."
WCPFC7,74,"The EU noted its support for the SIDS reporting process. The EU presented a preliminary report at TCC6, and has produced a new version of that report for WCPFC7 (WCPFC-2010-DP33). The EU aims to reinforce the role of PICs in organisations such as the WCPFC, noting that effective multilateral cooperation benefits all participants, especially in terms of effective resource management. The EU’s main support comes from the European Development Fund, which provides $42 million explicitly for fisheries projects in 2008–2012. The goal is sustainable management, and maximization of economic benefits for the region. One of the EU programs funds most of the research underpinning the work of the WCPFC Scientific Committee. Most EU-funded projects are implemented by FFA and SPC. There are also direct contributions made by some EU member states. The EU provided specific details on several projects, and reiterated its support for reviewing steps taken for addressing the rights and aspirations of SIDS, and reporting regularly on new initiatives that arise."
WCPFC7,75,"Tonga noted the importance of the issue, and acknowledged the assistance provided by developed members, but joined other FFA members in calling for full recognition of the needs of SIDS. Tonga stressed the need to enhance its capacity to manage fishery resources, through financial and other means."
WCPFC7,76,"The USA referred to a paper it presented at TCC6 (TCC6-2010-DP-17), noting it had contributed to the Commission’s Article 30 fund, and devoted significant time, energy and funds in building observer programme capacity; in enforcement-related activities; in supporting regional fisheries enforcement efforts; and on fish and turtle tagging studies. Recently the USA sent staff members to work in RMI and FSM to undertake port sampling; and the USA provides capacity building support to Palau, FSM, and RMI through its Compact arrangements. The USA offered to provide additional information, and to discuss internship opportunities with interested members."
WCPFC7,77,"New Zealand fully supported the proposals made by Pacific SIDS, and recognized the importance of fisheries for economic growth in the Pacific. New Zealand is working more closely with SIDS to understand what is wanted and needed, and is providing assistance with a focus on 16  tangible results. New Zealand outlined a range of training programs that it is providing, and its efforts to strengthen linkages with industry, and encourage the development of a developed states reporting template."
WCPFC7,78,"Korea noted the aspirations of SIDS for achieving these through fishing industry development. Korea is assisting with infrastructure in Solomon Islands, including a tuna processing plant and associated industry; the joint venture is scheduled to commence in 2011, and will be followed by cooperation between Korea and other SIDS. Korea is also providing funding for tagging, and assisting with crew training for SIDS."
WCPFC7,79,"Chinese Taipei indicated it supported capacity building through a regional observer training programme, and has some nationals from island states in its vessel crews. Support was also provided for fisheries development projects proposed by SIDS, and for the special requirements fund (40,000 USD). Chinese Taipei also assists SIDS to obtain fishing vessels and investment, in keeping with Resolution 2008-01. The investment in onshore facilities by private sector is helping SIDS to develop their fisheries in conjunction with acquisition of purse seine fishing vessel was consistent with resolution 2008/01 in assisting SIDS in the development of their fisheries, despite the criticism of by some members of creating overcapacity in the region, resulting the adoption of 2005-02”"
WCPFC7,80,"Vanuatu fully supported the statements made by other FFA members, and acknowledged assistance provided to it by Japan, the EU, USA, China, Australia, New Zealand and France."
WCPFC7,81,"The Philippines noted the various types of assistance given to developing nations, and encouraged developed CCMs to provide assistance in the form of investment as well, as it has done."
WCPFC7,82, RMI thanked those CCMs that had provided reports. In particular RMI thanked developed CCMs for the various assistance currently being provided in the region including non-fisheries assistance. RMI also referred to Resolution 2008-01 and Article 30 of the Convention and encouraged CCMs to also focus future reports on implementation of those provisions.
WCPFC7,83,The Chair looked forward to future reports describing more targeted cooperation. 3.4 Annual Report of the Work of the Commission
WCPFC7,84,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC7-2010-11, which presents a profile of the Commission‘s work during 2010. The report summarizes the work of the WCPFC subsidiary bodies, the Secretariat, contracts and consultancies, relations with other organizations and emerging issues. The Executive Director noted staff changes during 2010, and that the VMS audit would be undertaken in cooperation with FFA, and utilise CCM staff members rather than consultants."
WCPFC7,85,WCPFC7 took note of the annual report of the work of the Commission.   3.4.1 Cooperation with other Organisations
WCPFC7,86,"The Executive Director noted the continued support from and cooperation with SPC, FFA, the new PNA office, ISC, and IATTC, and the value of internships and secondments to the work of the Commission. He noted in particular: a) the proposed amendment to the WCPFC/SPC MOU on data sharing to permit SPC access to VMS data for compliance and science purposes; b) the Chair’s signing of the MOU between WCPFC and the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission; 17  c) IATTC’s proposed changes to the IATTC/WCPFC ROP Cross Endorsement Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC), and ongoing efforts by the EU with regard to this MOC (WCPFC7-2010 DP-25); and  d) the need for discussion with IATTC regarding a joint management plan for the overlap area, noting the recommendations from TCC6 that the Heads of the WCPFC and IATTC secretariats meet to develop a Joint Management Scheme. The Secretariat invited WCPFC7 to provide guidance to the Executive Director as to the minimum criteria for the joint management scheme."
WCPFC7,87,"The Commission directed the Executive Director to work with the IATTC Director in development of draft TORs for a Joint Management Scheme proposal, and to present those TORs to the Commission intersessionally in mid-2011."
WCPFC7,88,The EU introduced WCPFC7-2010 DP-25 on the cross endorsement of observers.
WCPFC7,89,"PNG, on behalf of FFA members thanked the EU for their efforts in progressing the issue since TCC6. While supporting the Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) as proposed, FFA members sought clarification from the Legal Adviser regarding whether a cross-endorsed IATTC observer on a vessel that moves out of the high seas and commences fishing in an EEZ would be required to stop recording data in the EEZ."
WCPFC7,90,"FFA members sought assurance of the Commission that if it transpires that cross endorsed observers that are not FFA observers continues to record when vessels are moving from high seas to EEZs of FFA states, then FFA members will have the ability to initiate an immediate review or termination by the Commission.  FFA members recommended that WCPFC7 approve the draft MOC and direct the Secretariat to consult with IATTC with a view to signing the MOC as soon as possible.  FFA also recommended that WCPFC7 agree that the WCPFC Secretariat would issue a notice of intention to terminate the MOC immediately upon request of three or more CCMs."
WCPFC7,91,"Other CCMs voiced support for developing and signing an MOC as soon as possible, to facilitate the operation of vessels that operate in both convention areas; they voiced support for a precautionary approach that ensures effective conservation measures are in effect in the overlap area, and for exploring ways in which the two RFMOs can work together more closely and effectively. The Director of the IATTC gave his assurance that all members of the IATTC would be open to cooperation with the WCPFC, but noted there were complex issues to be addressed."
WCPFC7,92,WCPFC7 adopted WCPFC7-2010 DP-25 (Rev. 2) on Cross Endorsement of Observers (Attachment Q) noting the recommendations of FFA in para 90.  3.4.2 Future work of the Commission
WCPFC7,93,"Australia noted, on behalf of FFA members, that the current MOU between the ISC and WCPFC includes in Part 4 a clause that stipulates a full review of the MOU will be undertaken every three years.  At WCPFC6 FFA members proposed the review be undertaken during 2010. Australia noted FFA members remain supportive of the recommendations of the Independent Review of Science Structure and Function, adopted by WCPFC6, and strongly believe that (i) the role of the ISC should be primarily in relation to the three northern stocks; (ii) SC must be able to directly request advice from the ISC on the status of North Pacific stocks; and (iii) the suggested changes to the MOU proposed by the Secretariat in 2009 are a helpful basis for revising the MOU between ISC and WCPFC.  They emphasized there should be a single stream of scientific advice coming to the Commission through the SC, and a closer working relationship between the SC and the ISC, to allow the SC to directly request advice from the ISC. 18"
WCPFC7,94,The Executive Director indicated that proposed changes to the MOU were considered at NC6.
WCPFC7,95,The NC Chair indicated that NC6 agreed no changes were required.
WCPFC7,96,"FSM, on behalf of FFA members, supported the comment by Australia, and stressed that scientific advice should come through the SC, irrespective of the region it relates to, to enable the Commission to receive scientific advice of a consistent standard and subject to the same standard of scientific scrutiny and review by the SC for the entire Convention Area."
WCPFC7,97,"FFA members recommended that the Commission agree to a decision that “the MOU between WCPFC and ISC should be revised to better align it with the Convention and to ensure a single stream of scientific advice comes to the Commission through the Scientific Committee.  There should be a closer working relationship between the SC and the ISC, specifically to allow the SC to directly request advice from the ISC.”"
WCPFC7,98,"Japan indicated that the MOU derived from the special history of the NC, and indicated its support for enhancing the cooperation between the SC and ISC, while stressing there was no need to amend the MOU."
WCPFC7,99,"The Chair noted the issues had been raised in the SC meeting, and that there appeared to be some unease in the relationship between the two bodies: it was felt there should be some standardization in scientific advice received by SC and NC. He expressed concern that there should be a standard approach to scientific advice, so that members are sure that the basis for scientific advice is the same. This has also been addressed in other bodies."
WCPFC7,100,Several CCMs noted that a useful minimum improvement would be to have ISC stock assessments presented to the SC in full.
WCPFC7,101,"WCPFC7 directed that the Secretariat undertake a review of the MOU between WCPFC and ISC in 2011, and that it be addressed at WCPFC8. The MOU is to be modified to expressly address (i) participation by the WCPFC Science Provider in the 2011 north Pacific striped marlin assessment, and (ii) presentation of the assessment to SC7 for review."
WCPFC7,102,"In response to a query regarding information presented in p. 6 of WCPFC7-2010-11, the Executive Director indicated the Secretariat was exploring ways to improve reporting to CCMs on activities (e.g. meetings and consultations) undertaken by Secretariat staff, including via a quarterly newsletter.  AGENDA  ITEM  4  -  PROPOSED CMMs FOR CONSIDERATION AT THIS MEETING"
WCPFC7,103,CMMs are addressed under Agenda Item 9. AGENDA  ITEM  5  -  SCIENCE ISSUES 5.1 Report of the Sixth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee
WCPFC7,104,"The Chair of the Scientific Committee, Dr Naozumi Miyabe (Japan), provided a summary of the Sixth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee (SC6) which was held 10–19August, 2010 at Nuku’alofa, Tonga.    5.1.1 Stock status of key tuna species and evaluation of CMM 2008-01"
WCPFC7,105," Dr John Hampton (SPC Oceanic Fisheries Programme Manager) presented an overview of the WCPO fisheries stock status for skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye and South Pacific albacore. The total 2009 catch of 2.48 million mt was a record, and dominated by skipjack and yellowfin. The 19  catch was driven by the purse seine fishery, with skipjack being the predominant species taken. The purse seine catch in 2009 had a typical equatorial distribution. In 2009 the catch included a strong eastern component, as is typical of El Nino years. Purse seine effort has continued to increase over time. There are two key components: associated sets and unassociated sets; both have continued to increase over time in roughly equal amounts. Bigeye tuna catch by purse seine is concentrated in associated sets. The longline catch in 2009 showed strong concentration of albacore tuna, to about 66,000 mt. There is also decline in tropical longline fishery targeting bigeye tuna and yellowfin; that is consistent with information to be reported on effort in the longline fishery. The highest longline effort is between 20°N to 10°S. The skipjack catch has continued to increase rapidly, and reached approximately 1.7 million mt in 2009, dominated by purse seine catch. The pole and line contribution continues to decline."
WCPFC7,106,"The WCPO skipjack stock is decreasing slowly, and is now about 50% depleted from an unexploited level. This is a moderate level of depletion: the stock is not overfished, and there is no overfishing.  However, at some time in the near future a decision will have to be made as to the acceptable level of depletion and future harvest strategies for this stock."
WCPFC7,107,"Yellowfin was assessed in 2009. Catch increased in 2008 after a period of stability, but there has not been the same growth in the yellowfin catch as has been seen for skipjack. There is evidence that the full exploitation potential of yellowfin has been reached. The yellowfin stock has decreased steadily, and it is now around 50% of the unexploited biomass. This is considered to be a moderate level of depletion. Depletion is much stronger in the western equatorial zone, where 90% of the catch occurs. In this region there is much steeper decline in biomass, and much larger impacts of fishing."
WCPFC7,108,"Bigeye was assessed in 2010. The catch has been stable for the past 10 years. The longline catch is mainly of adults, but there is a recent increase in the purse seine catch following FAD introduction. The purse seine catch reported in statistical bulletins is probably underestimated, an issue which is being addressed through ongoing work on purse seine species composition by various methods (grab vs. spill sampling). Bigeye biomass has declined steadily over a long period of time. In the absence of fishing, the assessment suggests that biomass would have increased strongly due to increased recruitment in last 20 years. There is an element of uncertainty in this result, and early stock size and recruitment may be underestimated. In recent years there has been a very high level of depletion compared to what it would be in the absence of fishing."
WCPFC7,109,"South Pacific albacore was assessed in 2009. The fishery is composed almost entirely of longline vessels catching adult albacore. The catch has doubled since the mid-1990s, and is now in excess of 60,000 mt. There is also a small troll fishery in New Zealand. The South Pacific albacore assessment shows biomass has declined steadily since the mid-1970s. The current level of depletion of the stock due to fishing is ~ 30% (a moderate level of depletion), and current catches are sustainable. The stock is not overfished, and there is no overfishing."
WCPFC7,110,"In summary, a composite Kobe Plot of spawning biomass shows concerns for bigeye tuna, and for yellowfin in the western equatorial area."
WCPFC7,111,"Kiribati spoke on behalf of FFA members, and accepted the conclusions and recommendations on the management of the various stocks as outlined, and proposed that the SC advice on stock status be adopted by the Commission as the basis for work on stock management by the Commission. FFA members noted (i) that the bigeye assessment was more optimistic than the 2009 assessment, but that the status of the stock would have been worse and the recommended reductions greater if the model run with a different value for steepness was used as a basis for the advice; and (ii) the increase in the impact of fishing on the skipjack stock, pointing to the need to give greater priority to addressing skipjack stock status in the Commission’s work. 20"
WCPFC7,112,"Several CCMs noted with concern the condition of bigeye tuna, western yellowfin, and skipjack stocks, and the need for action to preserve stocks."
WCPFC7,113,"In response to queries from CCMs, Dr Hampton provided the following additional information:  i. in conducting stock assessments SPC makes many model runs using different model configurations, with some much simpler than others. Where possible parallel assessments are also conducted using different modeling platforms; ii. a rapid change in skipjack biomass is possible, depending on recruitment, as most skipjack fisheries focus on 1 or 2 age classes. A decline in skipjack fisheries has been observed off Japan, which may reflect reduced availability of skipjack in peripheral areas due to high exploitation in the core equatorial area. There is a need to better understand the links between stocks, and tagging programs should assist in this regard; iii. the recruitment trend in bigeye tuna is a particular concern, and is driven by a relatively flat or slowly declining longline CPUE trend in combination with the rapid expansion in the catch of juvenile bigeye tuna since the mid-1990s. The credibility of the estimated recruitment trend is therefore related to the credibility of the longline CPUE, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. This is an issue that needs to be addressed with some urgency;  iv. the bigeye tuna stock assessment indicates that a 29% reduction in fishing mortality is needed to reduce fishing mortality to FMSY.  v. caution is needed when comparing skipjack MSY and catch levels, as there is large variability in recruitment. Recent skipjack recruitment is somewhat higher than the long-term average, which can result in high catches in relation to equilibrium yield; vi. availability of skipjack in the South Pacific varies significantly from year to year, especially in Australian and New Zealand waters, making it hard to detect long-term trends. SPC is currently examining the issue of possible range contraction in skipjack and other tuna stocks."
WCPFC7,114,"The Commission accepted the following SC6 recommendations and findings on the status of the key tuna stocks: i. A minimum 29% reduction in bigeye tuna fishing mortality from the average levels for 2005–2008 with the goal of returning the fishing mortality rate to FMSY. ii. There was no new information on the stock status of yellowfin tuna in 2010, and management recommendations from SC5 are to be maintained. iii. There was no new information on the stock status of South Pacific albacore tuna in 2010 and management recommendations from SC5 are to be maintained. iv. The management advice from SC5 on South Pacific swordfish is to be maintained pending a new assessment or other new information.  v. A new stock assessment was not conducted for southwest Pacific striped marlin and the stock status description and management recommendations from SC2 are to be maintained.  vi. Adoption of the conservation advice provided by ISC9 on North Pacific albacore.  vii. Adoption of the conservation advice provided by ISC10 on Pacific bluefin tuna (that the level of F be decreased below the 2002–2004 levels, particularly on juvenile age classes). 21  viii. Adoption of the conservation advice provided by ISC10 on North Pacific swordfish stocks (that both swordfish stocks in the North Pacific are healthy and above the level required to sustain recent catches). ix. For North Pacific striped marlin: a) develop/adopt an interim CMM for 2011;  b) request that the ISC provide estimated catch levels corresponding to average fishing mortality during 2001–2003 and fishing mortality reference points including Fmsy and F at various spawning potential ratios; and c) that the Scientific Services Provider participate in the north Pacific striped marlin assessment led by the ISC and that the assessment be presented to SC7 for review ."
WCPFC7,115,"The Commission also accepted the following SC6 recommendations and observations:  i. the continuation of the bigeye tuna age and reproductive biology study;  ii. the work plan of the Fishing Technology theme;  iii. a review of South Pacific swordfish data during 2011, will be presented to SC7.  iv. collation of southwest Pacific striped marlin data for a planned stock assessment in 2012; v. full stock assessments of WCPO bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin tuna, and an update of south Pacific albacore, while noting that the USA facilitated an independent peer review of the 2009 WCPO yellowfin tuna assessment and the review will be forwarded to the Scientific Services Provider for use in the April 2011 stock assessment preparatory workshop; vi. the recommendations of the Management Issues theme regarding: a) continuation of limit reference points identification;  b) further analyses of the effectiveness of the FAD closure, including through examination of observer reports; and c) implementation of Kobe II joint RFMO workshop outcomes;  vii. the recommendations of the Ecosystem and Bycatch Mitigation theme, noting the various research findings relating to seabirds;  viii. that the budget for the collection and evaluation of purse-seine species composition data be increased by US$30,000; ix. that SC strategic plan contains no requirement for a mandatory external peer review; and  x. the new SC meeting structure."
WCPFC7,116,"The WCPFC7 discussed the timing of and required data for a south Pacific swordfish stock assessment. It was noted that a further stock assessment would be difficult to progress until operational level catch and effort and size data was available from vessels fishing in the South Central pacific area, particularly a fleet flying the flag of one of the EU member States, as well as issues with fleets of some other CCMs. The EU drew attention to the suggestions for improving the SC work and structure submitted in intersessional EU correspondence to WCPFC CCMs (WCPFC-2010-IP10)"
WCPFC7,117,"The Commission directed the Secretariat to make written requests to members seeking the cooperation of all CCMs that fish for the species in providing detailed size data and operational-level logsheet data specifying catch and effort, in order to enable a full assessment to be undertaken in 2012.    22   Management Objectives Workshop"
WCPFC7,118,"CCMs supported the holding of the proposed Management Objectives Workshop as an important necessary step towards the analysis of management strategies and adoption of reference points.  They requested that the WCPFC Secretariat ensure in its workshop planning that management objectives are firmly based on and reflect the full range of considerations related to stock management provided for by the Convention. In addition, members noted it was essential that the work on management objectives should also reflect multi-species considerations. It was proposed that the workshop also explore a pilot programme for applying the Kobe II Strategy Matrix for bigeye tuna."
WCPFC7,119,"The EU requested clarification on how the proposed independent international experts would be selected, suggesting this should be done under the direction of the Commission, and how members and their scientists and managers would be involved in the preparatory work, including in the preparation of TOR. A CCM also indicated limits on the catch of adult bigeye tuna should also be considered."
WCPFC7,120,"In response to a CCM’s question on the impacts of longline catch on bigeye tuna stock, the SC chair noted that SPC, through its analysis, was seeking to capture information on the impact of CMM 2008-01 on adult bigeye catch, and stressed the need to ensure effective measures to reduce juvenile bigeye catch, as it could result in rapid reduction in MSY. He noted that purse seine fishing in association with FADs was impacting spawning stock biomass, and agreed that protection of adult bigeye would also be beneficial."
WCPFC7,121,"The Executive Director noted that the selection of independent international experts was normally done in consultation with the WCPFC Committee chairs and Members, to reflect a good balance between the interests in the Commission. He also indicated that there was a strong link between management objectives and science, and that both scientists and managers should attend the workshop, but this should not interfere with setting of science-based objectives."
WCPFC7,122,"The Commission directed the Secretariat to prepare TORs for the Management Objectives Workshop, which is to be held in 2012. Paired spill / grab experimental sampling"
WCPFC7,123,"CCMs strongly supported the SC recommendation that further work be done to extend paired spill/grab experimental sampling and verify this data against cannery, unloading and port sampling data. Members noted the importance of improving purse-seine species composition data for the assessments of several major species, and the need to increase the budget for this project in the SC work programme. Some CCMs voiced concern regarding the setting of budget priorities, suggesting a need to periodically reassess Commission funding allocation, and to seek to avoid budget increases."
WCPFC7,124,PNG inquired how national-level ROP data from port sampling could be utilized.
WCPFC7,125,"Dr Hampton (SPC) supported the interventions calling for more work on paired spill/grab experimental sampling, indicating the work was of a very high priority. He noted good prior cooperation from some CCM industries, and requested that such cooperation be extended in the future when paired sampling trials were conducted aboard member’s vessels. In response to the query from PNG he noted the desire to use port sampling data collected by members through national programs to the extent possible, but indicated that the best way to determine purse seine species composition is through sampling at sea by observers, as fish may be transshipped and mixed onboard vessels. 23"
WCPFC7,126,"The Commission agreed to increase the budget for the spill/grab sampling project from $60,000 to $90,000.  Peer review of the bigeye stock assessment"
WCPFC7,127,"The SC Chair recommended that a budget be provided for a peer review of the 2010 bigeye tuna stock assessment in 2011, if required."
WCPFC7,128,"The USA advised the review deadline for bigeye tuna had passed, and could not be done in 2011."
WCPFC7,129,"At the FAC4 meeting, it was proposed to conduct a workshop-style review, rather than a desk study review, in early 2012 based on the 2011 bigeye assessment; this will provide an in-depth review that interacts with the stock assessment scientists. The workshop-style review of the 2011 bigeye stock assessment will be convened in early 2012, in consultation with SPC; a relevant budget will be proposed by SC7 to WCPFC8."
WCPFC7,130,The Commission endorsed undertaking a workshop-style peer-review of the 2011 bigeye stock assessment in early 2012.  Administration: Outstanding issues from the Independent Review
WCPFC7,131,WCPFC7 took note of the responses by SC6 to the issues to be addressed from the Independent Review of the Commission’s Transitional Science Structure and Functions including the endorsement of the revised TOR for the Stock Assessment Preparatory Workshop (Attachment L of the SC6 Summary Report). 5.1.2 Shark Assessment and Research Plan
WCPFC7,132,"Dr Shelley Clarke (SPC) presented WCPFC7-2010-16, summarizing progress toward shark assessments. She noted that the Shark Research Plan (endorsed by SC6) is designed to lay a scientific foundation for further consideration by WCPFC of stock status and sustainability of key shark species within the Convention Area. The information presented in WCPFC7-2010-16 reflects the exploratory analyses of available data initiated as preliminary steps toward stock assessments. While some interesting trends were identified, ongoing data gaps and biases have yet to be fully addressed and conclusions about stock status would be premature. SPC will continue analyses based on existing data, but it is becoming increasingly clear that better information is required. Without additional research and data contributions, it is likely that stock assessments for some species will be severely compromised. She highlighted the importance of decisions to be made by WCPFC7 with respect to: i. approval of the Shark Research Plan  ii. reallocation of existing funds within the Scientific Services Provider’s budget to support shark assessment through 2012, thereby enabling three shark stock assessments (silky, oceanic whitetip and blue) to be completed by the end of 2012; and  iii. inclusion of the eight key shark species listed in CMM 2009-04 in catch reporting to the Commission, including annual catches, operational level data (where applicable), and recreational catch and effort data (where possible), as recommended by SC6, which would greatly expand the logsheet data available for the shark assessments."
WCPFC7,133,The USA noted that undigitized historical data on shark catches from the early days of the observer programme may contain information on haulback fate and mortality and may be made available.
WCPFC7,134,"Palau, on behalf of FFA members, supported enhancement of the Commission’s shark management activities as a high-priority activity, and adoption of the Plan. FFA members also welcomed the review of information on shark stock status requested by the Commission in CMM 24  2009-04, which illustrates the work needed by the Commission prior to conducting formal stock assessments of key shark species, and supported making use of the available information while the arrangements are put in place to improve data. They supported SC recommendations on improving data for key shark species, which will be assisted by implementation of ROP requirements for observer coverage on longline vessels. FFA members indicated that assessment of shark stocks will need to depend on existing data for the near future, and thanked CCMs for making the data available."
WCPFC7,135,A CCM expressed concerns that some longline fishermen had trouble in accurately identifying shark species. It suggested silky shark should not be a priority for data collection.
WCPFC7,136,"The EU supported the approach outlined, including the reporting requirements, and agreed hammerheads and porbeagles should be added to the list of key shark species.  . The EU has adopted an action plan for sharks, and is implementing a project that seeks to improve the provision of scientific advice for that action plan, including collation and examination of historical catch and effort data by shark species for EU vessels in all oceans. Once available, the results will be shared with all RFMOs."
WCPFC7,137,"Japan confirmed that shark data had been submitted to SPC and invited SPC scientists to conduct joint shark data analyses with Japan. They noted with concern a large amount of unreported shark catch by small-scale longliners belonging to one CCM. Japan encouraged the Commission to adopt a CDS to assist with such issues in relation to sharks. Japan requested that the SC address hammerhead sharks, as it is the most prized species in shark fin markets."
WCPFC7,138,"China supported the need to collect data on shark species, including possibly through a CDS. China noted the need to identify different species, possibly through a genetic database."
WCPFC7,139,"Australia supported Palau’s intervention, and noted the usefulness of observer coverage on longline vessels (from 2012). It suggested that further action by the Commission on mitigation practices realting to sharks, for example consideration of the use of wire traces, need not wait for the outcomes of the shark research plan. Australia proposed adoption of the recommendation of the SC regarding key shark species by amending CMM 2009-04 to include porbeagle and hammerhead sharks."
WCPFC7,140,"Korea noted the importance of shark research, but advocated prioritizing SC projects within the Commission budget. Korea also urged careful consideration of whether a CDS would be applied to all shark species, and how it could be made cost effective."
WCPFC7,141,"New Zealand supported the research plan, noting the work was constrained by the low quality of available data. New Zealand supported data reporting requirements for sharks, addition of porbeagles and hammerheads to the list of key shark species, and the need for minimum standards for collection of bycatch data."
WCPFC7,142,"PNG supported the shark research work, indicating it has a shark fishery that makes use of the entire shark, and has had a management plan in place for the last 10 years. Data is supplied to SPC."
WCPFC7,143,"The Secretariat noted that expansion of the list of key shark species in CMM 2009-04 would result in expansion of the list of species that CCMs are asked to report on from 8 to 13 species. However, assessments under the Shark Research Plan would for the time being be limited to the original 8 key species, until such time as additional funding is agreed by the Commission."
WCPFC7,144,WCPFC7 approved the shark research plan and the reallocation of existing funds within the Scientific Services budget to support shark assessments during 2011 and 2012. WCPFC7 agreed to add porbeagle and four species of hammerhead sharks to the 25  Commission’s key shark species in CMM 2009-04 (Attachment DD). This amendment raises the number of key shark species to be reported to the Commission to 13 but maintains the original 8 key species as the focus of the Shark Research Plan until further funding is made available.  5.2 Kobe II Workshop recommendations on Science and Bycatch
WCPFC7,145,"The Commission accepted the Kobe II science and bycatch recommendations (as contained in Attachment M of the SC6 Report), and recommended that the WCPFC Secretariat take the lead in working with the other tuna RFMOs to establish a bycatch working group to meet at the earliest opportunity. Kobe III may present an opportunity for a meeting of this group. The Secretariat will consult with members on the representation on this working group. 5.3 Programme of Work for the Scientific Committee in 2011"
WCPFC7,146,"The SC Chair presented the programme of work for the Scientific Committee in 2011, with a total proposed budget of US$1,066,000. Within the proposed work programme, the work on seabirds to continue the ERA analysis of areas of high seabird interactions (US$10,000) was deferred. The FAC approved funding for a workshop on management objectives for 2011 however subsequent discussion in WCPFC7 decided that due to a heavy schedule of meetings the workshop should be deferred to 2012. The secretariat has noted the need to quarantine the funding for use in 2012."
WCPFC7,147," Tonga spoke on behalf of FFA members and thanked Dr Miyabe and his Vice Chair and team of conveners for the SC6 report and for the efficient conduct of the SC meeting.  FFA members noted the benefits of the new meeting structure, and the clarity of the summary report, and drew attention to the continuing advice from the SC that data deficiencies are affecting the quality of the scientific analysis and advice, and the WCPFC7 working papers that demonstrated the implications of incomplete, late or inaccurate data for the production of timely and reliable stock assessments.  FFA members requested WCPFC7 record its concern regarding the continuing failure of CCMs to provide timely complete and accurate data and the effect of this failure on the Commission’s scientific advice."
WCPFC7,148,"The Commission approved the 2011 SC work programme, and total budget of US$1,086,000, including the following specific elements, noting that $30,000 will be carried forward to fund the management options workshop in 2012: i. three full stock assessments of bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna, one updated assessment of south Pacific albacore, and key shark stock assessments (to be conducted by the Scientific Services Provider [SPC-OFP], in addition to other regular services as described in the previous services agreement), noting that if the yellowfin assessment does not occur $70,000 would need to be carried forward till 2012.; ii. continuation of the WPEA OFM Project; iii. refinement of bigeye parameters Pacific-wide; iv. continuation of the Pacific-wide tagging project; v. identification of provisional reference points work for key tuna species; vi. collection and evaluation of purse-seine species composition data vii. collation of South Pacific striped marlin data for a planned stock assessment in 2012; and viii. support for the 2012 Management Options workshop.  26  AGENDA  ITEM  6  -  NORTHERN COMMITTEE 6.1 Report of the Sixth Regular Session of the Northern Committee"
WCPFC7,149,"The Chair of the Northern Committee, Masanori Miyahara (Japan) introduced the outcomes of the Sixth Regular Session of the Northern Committee (NC6) held from 7–10 September 2010 in Fukuoka, Japan. He also briefly introduced WCPFC7-2010/35 (discussed under Agenda item 9.3.5) and WCPFC7-2010-35 (discussed under Agenda item 9.3.9)  6.2 Programme of Work for the Northern Committee  in 2011–2013"
WCPFC7,150,"The NC Chair referred to the programme of work contained in Attachment E of the NC6 Summary Report.  He also stated that in 2011 the ISC will conduct a full stock assessment for northern albacore tuna, and will recommend a new CMM for northern albacore tuna; in 2012 a full assessment for Pacific bluefin tuna will be undertaken, and additional CMMs for this stock considered. Swordfish stocks are in good condition; a full assessment will be done in 2013, and CMMs addressed at that time. The NC Chair referred to the NC voluntary fund commenting that NC members are expected to make contributions as agreed at NC6."
WCPFC7,151,WCPFC7 accepted the report of the Northern Committee and noted its programme of work.   AGENDA  ITEM  7  -  TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE 7.1 Report of the Sixth Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee
WCPFC7,152,"The Chair of the Technical and Compliance Committee, Noan Pokap, presented the Summary Report of the Sixth Technical and Compliance Committee meeting (TCC6), held in Palikir, Federated States of Micronesia from 30 September–5 October 2010."
WCPFC7,153,"The following recommendations from TCC6 were approved by WCPFC7: i. On the ROP from the TCC report (TCC 6 report para 31),  ii. For the release of ROP data (TCC 6 report para 35).   iii. On data gaps and ROP efficiency (TCC 6 report para 42), iv. task the Secretariat to develop further work on SSPs relating to the Commission VMS in light of comments from CCMs, and in the context of the VMS security audit (TCC 6 report para 72), v. task the Executive Director to work with the IATTC on the on the IATTC/WCPFC overlap area.  vi. Agreed that fees for non CCM flagged carriers and bunkers should be of $US 2,500 per annum."
WCPFC7,154,"Regarding the ROP, several CCMs noted that CMM 2007-01 is explicit about roles and responsibilities of various parties, including the Secretariat and observer coordinator, and suggested the coordinator should be empowered to progress issues that are highlighted in the ROP Annual Report, with reporting on specific issues to TCC7."
WCPFC7,155,"WCPFC7 agreed that the Final ROP Audit Report be provided to the CCM involved, with notification only relayed to the TCC and Commission when a programme fully complied with the Commission standards."
WCPFC7,156,A CCM noted it could be helpful if reports from successful audits were made available on the secure portion of the WCPFC website as is the case of annual reports. 27
WCPFC7,157,"FFA members stressed the importance of data to the work of the Commission, for both science and compliance, and noted that several additional FFA members had provided authorisation to treat relevant national data held by them as Commission data under the ROP. The Parties to the FSM Arrangement and US Treaty will be asked to provide similar authority for release of data from those sub-regional programmes at their next annual meetings in early 2011."
WCPFC7,158,"The EU stressed the importance of conducting an independent review of the Commission VMS, and noted paper WCPFC7-2010-DP-29, containing EU proposals addressing VMS audit TORs and cost savings. CCMs note the importance of conducting a broad, independent audit as soon as possible, and voiced support for integration of elements of the EU proposal into the TORs developed by the WCPFC and FFA secretariat.  Operation of Commission VMS"
WCPFC7,159,"WCPFC7 tasked the Secretariat with incorporating significant elements from WCPFC7-2010-DP-29 into the draft VMS audit TORs and circulating the revised version to members for their review and approval, with a view to conducting an audit in the first quarter of 2011."
WCPFC7,160,Addressed under agenda item 9 CMM 2007-03 Review of outstanding issues from WCPFC6 and operational issues
WCPFC7,161,"Cook Islands noted that boarding parties rely heavily on language cards to assist in communication and ensure positive outcomes from their inspections.  Those language cards are now several years old; given the number of new measures agreed to by the Commission, they require update urgently. FFA members fully support the recommendation that the Commission Secretariat lead the process of updating the cards, and that CCMs participate actively in this review to ensure the accuracy of the information that is used, and to manage the cost of the process.  Boarding and inspection"
WCPFC7,162,WCPFC approved that the Secretariat prepare updated language cards for use in high seas boarding and inspections and requested that CCMs assist the Secretariat with the translation of the updated cards to manage the cost process. .
WCPFC7,163,"WCPFC7 discussed the application by New Zealand for exemptions for particular purse- seine vessels under para. 26 of CMM 2009-06 (WCPFC-TCC6-2010/DP-02) and the recommendation made by TCC6 in its report (TCC 6 report para. 239) that such an exemption be granted. A CCM offered its interpretation that New Zealand could apply for a multi-year exemption under CMM 2009-06, and encouraged New Zealand to do so in the future. Transshipment"
WCPFC7,164,WCPFC7 adopted New Zealand’s application for exemption under para. 26 of CMM 2009-06 for 2011. 7.1.1 Update of Submission of Annual Reports Parts 1 and 2
WCPFC7,165,"The Chair made reference to WCPFC7-2010-19 (Rev 1) on compliance by CCMs with Part 1 and Part 2 reporting, and informed members that the Secretariat had received only 30 of the 35 expected Part 1 annual reports, and 26 part 2 reports. He noted that the request made previously to simplify the Part 2 annual report formatting would be addressed under Agenda Item 7.2.5"
WCPFC7,166,"Palau, on behalf of FFA members, noted the growing burden of annual reports, and particularly the Part 2 reports, stressing that the limited capacity, time and resources available to small island administrations to compile, verify and complete these reports.  FFA members noted 28  that Part 2 reports to be submitted in 2011 will be even more onerous as they will include the 11 CMMs that were agreed by WCPFC6.  On a more fundamental note, the information provided in the annual reports is not well suited for the primary purpose, which is to gauge implementation of CMMs. FFA members noted the close linkages between the streamlining of reports and agenda item 9.3.4 (proposed Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS))."
WCPFC7,167,"WCPFC7 approved the template for Part 2 Reporting, as revised in WCPFC7-2010-19 (Rev 1) (Attachment R), noting that work will be progressed during 2011 on a streamlined Part 2 Report (see agreement at para 229).  7.1.2 Update of CCM compliance with CMMs"
WCPFC7,168,"The WCPFC Compliance Manager, Peter Flewwelling, presented WCPF7-2010-20 (Rev 1).  He highlighted: i. the complexity and delays in submission of Part 2 Annual Reports; ii. 2009 fishing effort and catches compared to the 2000–2004 average or 2004 limit for bigeye and yellowfin tuna; iii. the lack of data on vessel numbers and catches for other large pelagic species."
WCPFC7,169,"FFA members highlighted the importance of WCPF7-2010-20, as the only systematic documentation of CCM compliance with CMMs. Para. 27 of the paper reports that many CCMs have failed to provide operational catch and effort data as required under the Commission’s scientific data rules. FFA members stressed the apparent systematic overfishing in 2009 of the high seas purse seine limits in CMM 2008-01 (Table 2 (a) of Attachment 5 of WCPF7-2010-20), suggesting CCMs identified as overfishing their high seas effort limits should provide an explanation to the Commission. FFA Members further proposed that the Commission consider adopting the following elements into this proposed conservation measure. CCMs who are not providing operational-level catch and effort data to the Commission in accordance with requirements in the WCPFC data rules on scientific data should provide reasons in their Annual Report Part 2. Additionally those CCMs who have domestic legal constraints that are preventing them from providing operational-level catch and effort data to the Commission in accordance with WCPFC requirements should also provide information on steps they are undertaking to overcome these constraints. Other CCMs, who are also SPC members, that have not yet done so, should also provide information on the constraints and steps that they are undertaking to overcome these constraints that are preventing them from authorising SPC-OFP to provide to the Commission on their behalf operational level catch and effort data that CCMs are required to provide to the Commission"
WCPFC7,170,"Japan provided clarifications regarding data they had submitted to the Commission, noting that during 2009, Japan implemented the high seas alternative measure. Japan stressed that the objective of CMM 2008-01 was to reduce the catch of bigeye tuna, and that Japan reduced its bigeye tuna purse seine bycatch by 26%. Japan also noted the need to consider data quality and accuracy, and the potential for data to be used for scientific analyses such as CPUE series."
WCPFC7,171,"The EU noted it has submitted a FAD management plan, which was not mentioned in the WCPF7-2010-20 (Rev 1). The EU said it was working with its members to satisfy its data commitments."
WCPFC7,172,Australia noted that attachments 2 and 3 of WCPF7-2010-20 omitted data contained in its Part 2 report.
WCPFC7,173,WCPFC7 acknowledged the importance of providing complete and accurate data in a timely way and urged CCMs to improve the provision of data to the Commission. WCPFC7 29  requested that CCMs that have issues in providing accurate and complete data in a timely manner should identify those issues clearly to the Commission. At TCC7 CCMs should provide a draft plan of how impairments to the provision of data will be dealt with as rapidly as possible. CCMs are encouraged to assist others as they are able to do so and the Commission should continue to evaluate methods to assist in this matter.   7.2  Intersessional reports developed from TCC6 7.2.1 Cost Recovery Terms of Reference
WCPFC7,174,The USA was asked at TCC6 to facilitate a process to develop Cost Recovery TORs. TCC6 recommended that CCMs provide comments on the draft terms of reference (WCPFC-TCC6-2010-35) to the USA (serving as coordinator of the small WG) by Oct 31 2010. Two CCMs provided comments. TCC6 requested that the coordinator provide a revised draft of the TORs to CCMs prior to WCPFC7 (provided as WCPFC7-2010-DP-21) so that the TORs could be considered by the FAC and the Commission. The TORs were amended during WCPFC7 on the basis of discussion and consultation.
WCPFC7,175,"WCPFC 7 adopted the TORs for a consultancy study on optimization of WCPFC programme operational costs, including through cost recovery, as amended (WCPFC7-2010-DP-21 (Rev 3)) (Attachment S).  7.2.2 IUU Vessel List for 2011"
WCPFC7,176,WCPFC7 considered the Provisional IUU Vessel List prepared by TCC6.
WCPFC7,177,"Regarding the Neptune, France reviewed that the Neptune, a Georgia-flagged vessel, was inspected twice in the port of Papeete. Log sheets show the Neptune was fishing in both WCPFC and IATTC Convention Areas, but was not on the WCPFC RFV. It had 160 mt of albacore onboard. Georgia was contacted in relation to this incident (15 June 2010) but did not respond."
WCPFC7,178,"A CCM requested clarification on whether Georgia was obligated to enforce specific conditions required by WCPFC, given that Georgia is a party to UNCLOS, but not to the 1995 HMFSA, or Commission."
WCPFC7,179,"Dr Tsamenyi (WCPFC Legal Advisor) noted that the key issue was whether Georgia, not being a member or CNM, has any duties with respect of its vessels, and whether the vessel had violated any CMMs. He noted Georgia is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but not the UN Fish Stocks Agreement. As a party to the Law of the Sea Convention, Georgia has two specific obligations: cooperate to conserve and manage highly migratory fish stocks, and take measures to regulate the fishing activities of its nationals on the high seas. Georgia issued a high seas fishing license to the Neptune, which states the vessel should not fish in a manner that undermines international conservation and management measures. Dr. Tsamenyi noted that Georgia was not eligible to place its vessels on the RFV, and that its absence from the RFV might not be a valid cause for IUU fishing. He indicated the basic issue was whether the Neptune had fished in a manner that violates specific CMMs."
WCPFC7,180,"France indicated that CMM 2007-03 requires there should be a prompt response by the flag State. Georgia failed to comply with CMM 2007-03. The Neptune was an otherwise unknown fishing vessel, operating in the WCPO without reporting its catch, and without cooperation by the flag State. France considered this is evidence of being engaged in activities that undermine the Convention and WCPFC CMMs, and thus maintained the Neptune should be placed on the WCPFC IUU list."
WCPFC7,181,"New Zealand proposed the Secretariat write to all non-member flag registries explicitly seeking their cooperation with WCPFC, so that in future there will be a basis for saying WCPFC 30  has sought the cooperation of all States, and in addition, it can be determined if non-members are fulfilling their duty to cooperate.  They suggested also describing the WCPFC CNM process, and advocating using this process if they intend to fish in the Convention Area."
WCPFC7,182,"The EU indicated the Neptune had been listed by IATTC in relation to the incident described by France, and noted that Georgia had responded in relation to another vessel but not the Neptune. Several CCMs joined the EU in supporting New Zealand’s suggestion as well as listing of the Neptune."
WCPFC7,183,"In response to an inquiry, the Legal Adviser stated members can implement legislation to prosecute non-members caught fishing in their waters; their ability to extend such national legislation to address the high seas in the Convention Area was less clear."
WCPFC7,184,WCPFC7 agreed by consensus to list the Neptune on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC7,185,"Regarding the Fu Chun No 126, a Vanuatu-flagged vessel, it was noted at TCC6 that settlement negotiations were underway but an agreement had not yet been reached."
WCPFC7,186,"New Zealand indicated a mutually satisfactory solution had been reached, and it no longer sought to pursue listing. New Zealand stated that considerable resources were required from both parties, and acknowledged Vanuatu for taking its flag-state responsibilities seriously."
WCPFC7,187,"Vanuatu indicated the matter had been resolved, and indicated it had informed the vessel owner and company of the IUU activities, restricted the vessel to port in Suva, and appointed two independent investigators. An observer was placed on the vessel for six months, and a process invoked to prosecute the Fu Chun No 126 in the Vanuatu courts. Vanuatu acknowledged New Zealand for its cooperation and assistance in resolving the case, and thanked the vessel owner (located in Chinese Taipei) for their assistance."
WCPFC7,188,WCFPC7 agreed by consensus not to list the Fu Chun No 126 on the WPCFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC7,189,"Regarding the Liao Da Gan Yu 55049, it was noted at TCC6 that settlement negotiations were underway but an agreement had not yet been reached."
WCPFC7,190,Solomon Islands indicated the matter had not been resolved to its satisfaction.
WCPFC7,191,"China indicated that the Liao Da Gan Yu 55049 had operated in Solomon Islands for 3 years under license, had paid an access fee to harvest for 2010, and had received an oral commitment from the Solomon Islands that the vessel could fish; a letter of comfort was granted two days after fishing activities began. In response to the incident the vessel was recalled to China and the license withdrawn for 3 months. China asked that the Liao Da Gan Yu 55049 not be listed, and that efforts to resolve the case be allowed to proceed intersessionally prior to TCC7."
WCPFC7,192,"Tuvalu indicated that the Liao Da Gan Yu 55049 violated its national laws shortly after TCC6, and was arrested, but that the case had been settled."
WCPFC7,193,"In response to a query from PNG, Solomon Islands confirmed that a license fee had been paid, and remained lodged with its central bank, but stressed that its procedures with respect to a development agreement had not been followed."
WCPFC7,194,"PNG noted that someone in Solomon Islands must have directed the vessel owners how to pay the license fee, and issued the authority to fish. While sympathizing with the efforts by Solomon Islands to combat corruption, PNG stressed that Commission should not be used to address internal problems."
WCPFC7,195,"New Zealand noted that TCC6 considered the facts carefully, made a recommendation to place the Liao Da Gan Yu 55049 on the provisional IUU list. From a procedural point of view, it 31  asked what new facts had been raised that affect the Commission’s position on the vessel; in the absence of new information, WCPFC7 may be undermining the process the Commission has established."
WCPFC7,196,"Some CCMs encouraged the parties to work bilaterally to resolve the issue. Other CCMs supported listing, and commended Solomon Islands for bringing the issue to the Commission and confronting the issue of corruption."
WCPFC7,197,WCPFC7 failed to reach consensus and the Liao Da Gan Yu 55049 was not placed on the WCPFC IUU vessel list.
WCPFC7,198,The USA inspected the Fu Lien No 1 when it came into port to offload. It determined the Fu Lien No 1.was without nationality and had been fishing for WCPF covered spercies on the high seas of the Convention area. The vessel has since been reflagged by Georgia and continues to fish in the regions.
WCPFC7,199,"Australia supported inclusion of the Fu Lien No 1 on the IUU list, as under CMM 2007-03 vessels without nationality are presumed to have carried out IUU fishing. It asked how such a vessel could be removed once listed."
WCPFC7,200,"The Legal Adviser noted that under CMM 2007-03 removal of a vessel must be initiated by the flag State. Georgia became the flag State after the incident in question, but it is the flag State at the time of the contravention that is responsible. He suggested it would be appropriate to include in the record a procedure to remove the Fu Lien No 1, or create an opportunity for the owner to remove the vessel, noting this was the first time this had arisen in the Commission."
WCPFC7,201,"WCPFC7 agreed by consensus to place the Fu Lien No 1 on the WCPFC IUU vessel list. WCPFC7 additionally noted that the procedures for de-listing an IUU vessel under CMM 2007-03 require action by the flag State. However, in the case of the F/V Fu Lien No. 1, it was listed for being without nationality and harvesting species covered by the WCPF Convention while on the high seas of the Convention Area. Therefore, the process for de-listing the F/V Fu Lien No. 1 requires special arrangements. Accordingly, the Commission agreed: i. that the Secretariat will write to the vessel’s current flag State in order to seek its assistance in resolving this matter. The Commission further agrees that in the event that the current flag State of Georgia determines that this matter is outside its jurisdiction, then the following actions by the owner of the F/V Fu Lien No. 1 will be deemed sufficient for the purpose of removing the vessel from the IUU list. Those actions are:  a. payment of voluntary contribution to the Commission in an amount deemed satisfactory by the Commission;  b. ensuring that the vessel is flagged to a responsible flag State; and  c. a written commitment by the vessel owner and flag State that it will comply with the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures."
WCPFC7,202,"FSM informed WCPFC7 that the incident involving the Jinn Feng Tsair #1 had not yet been settled to its satisfaction as the vessel has not yet submitted to justice in the FSM and has not paid any penalty to the FSM. However, dialogue with the flag State, Chinese Taipei, continues and FSM looks forward to resolving this issue in the near future."
WCPFC7,203,Chinese Taipei committed to continuing to try to resolve the incident.  32
WCPFC7,204,"WCPFC7 agreed by consensus to retain the Jinn Feng Tsair No.1, the Senta and the Yu Fong 168 on the WCPFC IUU vessel list."
WCPFC7,205,WCPFC7 agreed that the Secretariat should write to all non-member countries’ flag registries seeking their cooperation with WCPFC management measures.  7.2.3 KOBE II Workshop Recommendations on MCS and Management
WCPFC7,206,"The ED introduced WCPFC7-2010-23, noting that two KOBE II meetings focused on Management and MCS in 2010.  The recommendations from these workshops were discussed and responses developed at SC6 and TCC6."
WCPFC7,207,"FFA members recommended that the Commission adopt the recommendations from TCC6 relating to the Kobe Management Workshop. FFA members provided detailed comments on specific recommendations, and voiced support for:  i. defining and developing a list of “active” vessels, noting there are binding requirements, in CMM 2009-01, for flag States to advise the Commission each year of their active vessels; ii. considering a freeze on fishing capacity on a fishery by fishery basis that should not constrain the access to, development of, and benefit from sustainable tuna fisheries by developing coastal States, on the basis (a) that the sovereign rights of FFA members to determine who they will license in their waters and their right to participate in high seas fishing is recognized, and (b) the FAO definition of capacity, which is broader than vessel numbers alone;  iii. developing a consistent, enforceable regime for sanctions and penalties to be applied to WCPFC members and non-members and their vessels that breach the rules and regulations developed and implemented by WCPFC (addressed by the proposed CMS proposed by Australia in WCPFC7-2010-DP-12); iv. developing management arrangements that provide tangible opportunities for the domestic fisheries development of SIDS and Territories, including participation in high seas fisheries, and complement FFA members’ initiatives to implement zone-based management arrangements;   v. using the FAO definition of capacity “The amount of fish (or fishing effort) that can be produced over a period of time (e.g. a year or a fishing season) by a vessel or a fleet if fully utilised and for a given resource condition” until the Commission develops its own definition;   vi. reviewing and developing management regimes, based inter alia on the concept of fishing rights, and including rights-based regimes that recognize the rights of coastal States over EEZs, and some special recognition of SIDS in high seas fisheries. vii. ensuring a constant exchange of information with tuna RFMOs;  viii. establishing a joint tuna-RFMO technical working group to promote greater cooperation and coordination among RFMOs, and having the WCPFC Secretariat take a lead role in coordination of the working group between RFMOs."
WCPFC7,208,"The EU noted its support for the Kobe process, and noted that a number of issues relating to the Kobe outcomes would be addressed under Agenda Items 7.2.4 and 9."
WCPFC7,209,WCPFC7 approved the recommendations contained in WCPFC7-2010-23.
WCPFC7,210,"The USA noted that the Kobe III meeting will be held 11–15 July 2011 in La Jolla California, with pre-Kobe III workshops discussions on 11 and 15 January. The USA welcomes participation by Commissioners from all tuna RFMOs, and funds will be made available for travel costs for developing country participants. A steering committee has been established that 33  includes members from WCPFC CCMs, and a draft agenda will be posted in early 2011 at www.tuna-org.org. An information session will be held during the FAO COFI meeting in February; registration will be available in mid-January. The USA welcomes contributions from countries wishing to assist in supporting the workshop. 7.2.4  CDS Scheme"
WCPFC7,211,"The EU proposed a CDS in paper WCPFC7-2010-DP-18, proposing a CMM to implement a CDS for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna and swordfish. It noted the proposal is intended to support implementation of CMMs, and reflects the scheme applied in the EU which can facilitate after adoption in WCPFC the replacement of the EU catch certificate with the WCPFC catch certificate. The scheme is applicable to the main target species in the WCPO, and could be expanded to additional species in the future. It also provides for a simplified catch certificate to cater for small vessels and reduce the related administrative burden. The validating authority is the flag State, which is a non-negotiable issue for the EU. The EU stressed the effectiveness of such a CDS in fighting IUU fishing."
WCPFC7,212,"Japan noted that it presented a proposal of a CDS to the TCC6, which it requested remain under consideration. The Japanese proposal addresses skipjack taken by the purse seine fishery, and it authorizes port states to issue certificates. It also addresses shark as there are growing concerns in CITIES. PNG spoke on behalf of FFA members noting that at TCC6, the discussion on CDS was based around four papers presented by the EU, Japan, PNG and the WCPFC Secretariat. The outcome of that discussion was that FFA agreed to lead a working group to progress work on a WCPFC CDS guided by the four reports (proposal set forth in WCPFC7-2010 DP-22). The paper includes a draft terms of reference with an outline of the operations of an intersessional working group, and a set of proposed guiding principles for the establishment of a WCPFC CDS. The process aims to develop a CDS that meets the aims of the four papers presented to TCC, and the interests of all Commission Members. The proposal reflects that the bulk of catches in the WCPO are made in the waters of developing coastal states."
WCPFC7,213,"Korea supported the development of a CDS which is one of the most effective measures to prevent IUU fishing. It stressed the need to consider the cost effectiveness and practicability of a CDS, and said the system should be applied to major target species before extending to other species. Korea supported the EU on issuance and validation in the CDS, which should be responsibility of the flag State rather than the coastal State."
WCPFC7,214,"Chinese Taipei supports the development of CDS in combating IUU fishing. It has applied voluntarily the CDS measure on pacific Bluefin Tuna as from 2010. Chinese Taipei supported the approach in WCPFC7-2010 DP-22, and noted the importance of considering cost-effectiveness."
WCPFC7,215,"The Cook Islands spoke on behalf of FFA members and suggested a WCPFC CDS could broadly serve the three objectives in the MRAG paper provided to TCC6 (provide information to improve understanding of resources and fisheries, verify and validate catches to assist monitoring of compliance and deter IUU fishing, and trace from vessel to market in a way that serves the needs and interests of all those involved in the catching, trading, marketing and management processes). FFA members view a CDS as a component of an overall fisheries monitoring system, one that builds on, and adds value to existing monitoring systems including existing documentation schemes."
WCPFC7,216,"The EU reiterated that flag States were under its legislation as well as under international legislation, the only entities able to control a vessel; provision for control by coastal or chartering States were not acceptable.  The EU introduced a statement on the matter (Attachment EE). 34"
WCPFC7,217,"China supported the Japan and EU proposals, noting that China was the biggest exporter to the EU market. China noted difficulties in including shark species due to problems with identification, and the need to establish a DNA data bank."
WCPFC7,218,"Several CCMs supported a CDS in principle, but indicated a CDS was just one aspect of broader monitoring and control measures. They stressed the need to focus primarily on species with significant IUU fishing and data problems and supported the proposal in WCPFC7-2010-DP-22."
WCPFC7,219,"The Marshall Islands spoke of behalf of FFA members and indicated that the approach sought to develop a CDS from first principles, as was done in development of the transshipment CMM, using a decentralized model that could cater for a range of different coastal State responses to market requirements.  It would also rely on some form of summary reporting from CCMs on catches in national waters covered by national CDSs. The effectiveness of such a de-centralised CDS scheme would be in having a strong component of end-use reporting, to enable coastal States and the Commission to reconcile catches with market consumption."
WCPFC7,220,"France expressed strong support for the EU CDS, as it is a powerful tool to fight IUU activities. It noted the importance of taking into account regional characteristics, and ensuring consistency between systems used in various RFMOs."
WCPFC7,221,"Differing views were expressed by CCMs on the issue of flag State vs. coastal or chartering State responsibility with regard to catch documentation. Several CCMs noted that, while desirable, extension of a CDS to shark species should not be seen as a substitute for CMMs on sharks."
WCPFC7,222,"One CCM noted that any CDS which does not cover all catches, including domestic landings, would not be acceptable.  CCMs also stressed the need for an open and transparent process, and compatibility with measures taken by other RFMOs."
WCPFC7,223,"WCPFC7 agreed to form an intersessional CDS Working Group, to be coordinated by PNG, to progress work on an inclusive WCPFC CDS that includes flag, coastal and market States, and enables certification and export. It was agreed that the first consultation would involve the development of  Terms of Reference (TORs) for the CDS Working Group. 7.2.5 Streamline Annual Report-Part 2 Report to WCPFC7"
WCPFC7,224,"The WCPFC Compliance Manager, Peter Flewwelling, presented WCPFC7-2010/25, containing general criteria provided to the Secretariat by a TCC6 small working group for streamlining the Annual Report – Part 2. The main criteria contained in the paper are:  i. Cost effectiveness for CCMs and the Commission; ii. A clear role for the Secretariat;  iii. Basing the reporting on fisheries management needs and priorities; iv. A reporting format that is flexible and relevant to individual CCMs, while retaining consistency; v. Efficiency – avoiding duplication and repetition; vi. Transparency (noting relevant data confidentiality rules);  vii. Allows for effective monitoring of compliance with measures."
WCPFC7,225,"The Compliance Manager suggested the Commission’s new Information Management System (IMS) could be used to streamline reporting, thereby allowing CCMs to focus on actual compliance with CMMs. In the future all CCMs would have access to enable them to track their reporting progress. He indicated initial costs could possibly be absorbed in the current budget.  35"
WCPFC7,226,"CCMs commented on the desirability of streamlining the annual report, but several expressed concern with proposed costs associated with modification to the IMS, and possible associated costs that would have to be borne by developing CCMs in ensuring the compatibility of their IT systems."
WCPFC7,227,"Several CCMs indicated that the most useful first step would to enable online input of Part 2 annual reports, as outlined by the TCC recommendation, and sought confirmation this would be done in the first year. CCMs also asked for a breakdown of any associated costs, and suggested an IMS could be helpful in compliance monitoring."
WCPFC7,228,"FFA members supported the ongoing work to review the Part 2 template, and the development of the IMS. They supported the Secretariat developing the work intersessionally, with subsequent review by the Commission. FFA members also suggested the budget for SIDS IT system testing should be increased, and noted required reporting by CCMs should be limited to the CMMs and Commission decisions of relevance to them. FFA members suggested several fishery categories to be included (longline fishery, purse seine fishery, pole and line fishery, or a combination of these), with CCM compliance performance under the relevant categories related to the status of the relevant fishery and stocks at a given time. They furthermore requested that automated reminders be sent out frequently (30 days, 14 days, 7 days and 3 days) prior to a reporting deadline."
WCPFC7,229,The Executive Director indicated the Secretariat would work intersessionally with any interested parties to further review and streamline the Part 2 reports. The Secretariat will report on the issue to WCPFC8.
WCPFC7,230,WCPFC7 noted the initiatives taken to streamline and automate reporting systems for the Part 2 Annual Reports and other Commission reporting processes. The WCPFC Secretariat was encouraged to work with interested CCMs during 2011 to further review and streamline the Part 2 reports mindful of SIDS IT constraints and the lack of budget. 7.3  Regional Observer Programme
WCPFC7,231,"Karl Staisch (Observer Programme Coordinator) introduced WCPFC7-2010-26. He noted that most issues addressed in the paper were addressed under other agenda items, except: h) During analysis and checking of ROP observer data there may be indications that a vessel may have breached the CMMs of the Commission. However, there are no agreed procedures in place for the Secretariat to report to the flag states these breaches detected by ROP observers for the high seas.  15. Detection of possible violations during ROP-observed Trips particularly during FAD Closure n) Vessel Flag States have requested copies of data collected by ROP observers, and clarification on what data should be released by the Commission data provider is required by the Secretariat and SPC. 16. Data required by Vessel Flag States"
WCPFC7,232,"He noted that additional countries had agreed to allow data to be sent to the Secretariat from SPC, requested that CCMs coordinate with the Secretariat regarding ROP audits, and asked CCMs to provide data on catch retention and vessel discards."
WCPFC7,233,"CCMs voiced support for the ROP noting its importance with respect to compliance and for collecting data for scientific analysis. CCMs discussed the process for approval of issues raised in the report, and suggested (i) that the Commission empower the ROP Coordinator to take action, in close coordination with the national and sub-regional observer programs, to address 36  technical issues, and report to TCC7 on progress; and (ii) focus Commission attention on higher-level policy issues. The EU noted that the process needs to be transparent and that regular updates should be given to members through the ROP contact points or in the case of the EU through correspondence to the Head of Delegation to the WCPFC. Several CCMs also noted that some ROP-related issues would be discussed under separate agenda items."
WCPFC7,234,"FFA members stated that there were a number of elements regarding the flow of ROP data that require additional clarifications, which is related to an issue in the ROP annual report about reporting on incidents. Actions are clear when they relate to alleged offences within the EEZ of the observer provider, but less clear in other cases. FFA members supported the recommendation from the Secretariat to develop guidelines about information flow and again look forward to reviewing outputs at TCC7. In addition, FFA members provided the following detailed comments: i. Data Management and Costs (recommendations (p) and (q)): support that data entry and management be undertaken by SPC in Noumea with support from FFA and relevant national programmes;   ii. ROP Observers (recommendations (a) to (e)): support that the Secretariat prepare more formal advice on the issues raised for consideration at TCC7, noting that the Pacific Island Regional Fisheries Observer Standards that FFA-member national and sub-regional observers are trained under are very well developed and adhered to.   iii. Definitions and Standards (recommendation k): support that the issue be deferred until after the programme audits being undertaken by the Secretariat, while noting with great concern that the liberal interpretation of these terms by some CCMs and their flagged vessels has extended into activities within FFA-member waters.  FFA members noted some vessels are of the opinion that it is acceptable to carry an observer from their own national programme including when fishing in FFA EEZs; this constitutes a disregard of domestic legislation for most FFA members and will not be tolerated.  It is a significant undermining of the hybrid approach, which is the fundamental principle upon which the ROP is built.  FFA members sought the responsible cooperation of other CCMs to advise all vessels that when fishing in FFA EEZs observers must be sourced in accordance with the approved hybrid approach, sub-regional policy and national law. FFA members also noted they expect the highest degree of cooperation in prosecuting vessels that contravene this requirement.  FFA members suggested that before entering an EEZ, vessels be required to report the nationality of the observer on board.   iv. Observer Reports (recommendation h): note that the responsibilities for provision of data and reports from ROP trips is less clear in the CMM than would have been desirable.  Regarding the issues of how and when vessel operators would have access to observer reports, FFA members noted the issue should be part of the work undertaken by the Secretariat in accordance with the TCC6 recommendation for a report to improve efficiency of the ROP from both the observer and the vessel perspective, and be considered at TCC7. v. Observers for Special Situations (recommendations i and j): support the need for provision of this nature and discretion for the Executive Director to manage such “special situations”; budgetary provision for this activity should be considered by the FAC.  vi. Data Required by Flag States (recommendation (t): rules and procedures for access to data are relatively clear in terms of the access that is provided to CCMs for non-public domain data relating to vessels flying their flag.  If needed, draft guidelines should be developed for consideration at TCC7 to address specific operational uncertainties. vii. ROP Working Group (recommendation (r):  Do not support the proposal for creation of a ROP-Technical and Operational Advisory Group (TOAG).   37"
WCPFC7,235,"Japan noted that, since the issue of data access by operators and flag states are important both for scientific and monitoring purpose, discussion should not be postponed to the next Commission meeting but should be discussed at this meeting under Agenda 9."
WCPFC7,236,Korea noted the significant improvements related to compliance and implementation of CMMs through the operation of the ROP. They noted the ROP data indicated many infringements of the FAD closure and asked the Secretariat to provide more information.
WCPFC7,237,"Concerns were raised over observer quality, debriefing standards, and regarding the behavior of crews and masters."
WCPFC7,238,"China indicated an arrangement was needed for large-scale longline transshipment on the high seas, and observer cross-endorsement with IATTC. They also indicated that they had trained 13 regional observers, who current have had no opportunity to work onboard vessels."
WCPFC7,239,"The ED indicated that FFA members had rules in place regarding the use of FFA member-based observers on their vessels, but that Chinese observers can work on vessels in the high seas."
WCPFC7,240,"Chinese Taipei noted that that the data rules clearly indicate that flag States should have access to non-public domain data, and suggested there was no need to discuss guidelines."
WCPFC7,241,"WCPFC7 reviewed and discussed  the report as presented, taking note of comments by members at TCC6 and WCPFC7 and  directed the Secretariat to undertake informal consultations as it proceeded to implement the recommendations made by TCC6, and to keep all CCMs informed of progress. 7.4 Vessel Monitoring System"
WCPFC7,242,"The ED indicated that issues raised in WCPFC7-2010-27 had largely been addressed at TCC6, or through recommendations adopted through the TCC6 report. He raised the issue of procedures and protocols for high seas monitoring and reporting anomalies."
WCPFC7,243,"CCMs, including FFA members, voiced their broad agreement, and suggested providing the Secretariat with a mandate to move ahead on the issues, with the details to be discussed at TCC."
WCPFC7,244,"Several specific issues of concern were raised: boundaries, which some CCMs sought to have published on the WCPFC website, the VMS audit (addressed under Agenda Item 7.1), and the need for coastal States to be informed by the Commission when potentially relevant infringements occur in their jurisdiction, as well as the responsible Flag State. The EU suggested it would be useful to have information on the WCPFC website about actual grey areas where boundaries are not yet defined."
WCPFC7,245,"The Chair noted that boundary determination is beyond the mandate of the Commission, and suggested the Commission direct the Secretariat to provide a link on its website to the UN website, to simplify access by CCMs to that information."
WCPFC7,246," WCPFC7 noted WCPFC7-2010/27 and its content, and directed the Secretariat to provide a link on its website to facilitate access to boundary information on the UN website.  7.5 Programme of work for the Technical and Compliance Committee 2011–2013"
WCPFC7,247,The TCC Chair presented WCPFC7-2010-28.
WCPFC7,248,"A CCM discussed the need, when adopting new CMMs, to consider the work requirements of TCC and other subsidiary bodies, and the potential additional costs to the Secretariat noting that the work programme determined by TCC6 could be impacted by decisions taken by WCPFC7.  38"
WCPFC7,249,"WCPFC7 approved the TCC work programme subject to the budget report, and with the understanding that the programme may be expanded to include some other items as decisions are made at WCPFC7."
WCPFC7,250,Two CCMs addressed the issue of how CCMs are referenced in the report. It was agreed that the Secretariat would examined the report and make any needed changes to ensure consistency with the precedent established over the previous 7 years.  Adoption of the TCC6 Summary Report.
WCPFC7,251,WCPFC7 noted the TCC6 Summary Report. AGENDA  ITEM  8  -  AD HOC TASK GROUP — DATA
WCPFC7,252,"The coordinator of the Ad Hoc Task Group (AHTG) — Data, Holly Koehler (USA), provided a brief report on the work of the AHTG during 2010 noting that WCPFC6 agreed that the work of the AHTG-Data should continue on an ad hoc basis with an initial focus at TCC6 on considering the issue of data provision by chartered vessels.TCC6 recommended to WCPFC7 that the AHWG-Data should also consider:  i.  the right of chartering states to access data; ii. that the process for data release takes into account the right of the chartering state with respect of data it has provided for chartered vessels."
WCPFC7,253,"The coordinator also noted the Secretariat paper WCPFC7-2010-29. The Secretariat noted that no work was undertaken on attribution of catches under charter arrangements but the consultant (Gillett, Preston and Associates) is expected to provide a preliminary report on the subject by mid-December 2010. On behalf of FFA Members, the Marshall Islands requested correction of two items in WCPFC7-2010-29:  i. The statement in WCPFC7-2010-29, para 1 (that WCPFC6 agreed that the work of the AHTG Data should include the issue of attribution of catches under charter arrangements) is incorrect.  The WCPFC6 discussion on the future scope of work of the AHTG (paras. 189 and 190 of the WCPFC6 report) does not mention catch attribution. ii. The scope of work for the AHTG (WCPFC7-2010-29, para 5) does not accurately reflect the discussion at TCC6 and the recommendation of TCC6 on this matter. At TCC, the AHTG Chair asked for clarification of the request to WCPFC6 by FFA members for further work by the AHTG.  In response, the Marshall Islands spoke on behalf of FFA members and pointed out a gap in the Commission rules on access to non-public domain data by chartering CCMs. The two sets of rules governing access to data are clear about the rights of flag States, coastal States and port States to access Commission data, but do not consider the rights of chartering States to access Commission data, which is a gap that needs to be addressed. In addition, the rules require the consent of the source of data for certain data releases. For some datasets, it may not be clear whether the data involved has been provided by the flag State or the chartering State. FFA members want to ensure that rights of the chartering State in respect of data that it has provided for chartered vessels are properly taken into account in the ‘consent process’ for data release. As a result, it was recommended in para 54 of the TCC6 report that the AHTG-Data should consider the two items in WCPFC7-2010-29 5b) and 5c). TCC6 did not recommend that the AHTG-Data should consider the broader issue of data provision by chartered vessels referred to in WCPFC7-2010-29 5a)."
WCPFC7,254,"The FFA members offered to provide a brief paper on the issues of the right of chartering states to access data, and the process for taking into account the right of chartering states with 39  respect of data it has provided for chartered vessels as a starting point for the work of the AHTG Data on these issues."
WCPFC7,255,"WCPFC7 noted WCPFC7-2010-29, while acknowledging the corrections provided by the Marshall Islands in para. 253 above. It was agreed the AHTG-Data would continue its intersessional work on the items identified in para 252 above, and report to TCC7. AGENDA  ITEM  9  -  CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES 9.1 CMMs listed for discussion at TCC6 and requiring further discussion 9.1.1 CMM 2007-03 — IUU Listing and Removal"
WCPFC7,256,"The USA introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-16, containing proposed amendments to procedures for applying para. 3(j) of CMM 2007-03 for the IUU vessel list. This paper took into account comments that had been provided intersessionally since TCC6 by two CCMs.  (i) Amendments to para. 3(j) procedures"
WCPFC7,257,"Fiji on behalf of FFA members noted concerns regarding risks associated with the proposal, including the impact on domestic processing plants supplied by vessels under common ownership. FFA members also noted that it remains very difficult to determine “common ownership”, indicating vessels are already owned via shelf or shell companies, subsidiaries, trading names etc and the adoption of these procedures and application of 3(j) is expected to raise the complexity of corporate structures and ownership."
WCPFC7,258,"Working on the margins of WCPFC7, the USA developed revised text to address these concerns. In response CCMs expressed their support for the procedures, which will be annexed to CMM 2007-03 while noting the following: i. Marshall Islands noted their intention to propose a “deeming procedure” in the future to address remaining ownership concerns; ii. the EU noted the potential for para. 11 to serve as a loophole; and iii. New Zealand indicated its desire to develop mechanisms to address control (as distinct from ownership) of vessels."
WCPFC7,259,"The Chair noted that 3(j) is part of CMM 2007-03, and that the Commission would issue a revision to 2007-03, including a revision of the timelines (see para 268 below), and with the 3(j) procedures in WCPFC7-2010-DP-16 (Rev 1) appended as an attachment."
WCPFC7,260,WCPFC7 adopted procedures related to para. 3(j) of CMM 2007-03 as set forth in WCPFC7-2010-DP-16 (Rev 1) (Attachment T).
WCPFC7,261,"Tonga introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-11, proposing amendments to para. 15 of CMM 2007-03 with the intent of (i) distinguishing between fishing violations that occur in a coastal State’s waters and those that occur on the high seas, (ii) requiring that fishing violations that occur in a coastal State’s waters be resolved to the satisfaction of that coastal State, and (iii) affirming the sovereignty and the exercise of sovereign rights of the coastal State. (ii) Amendments to paras. 15 and 25"
WCPFC7,262,Several CCMs stated they could not support the amendment.
WCPFC7,263,"FFA members voiced their support, and noted that the Convention Area differs from that of other RFMOs, due to including the EEZs of many Pacific Island countries. Several FFA members related problems they had experienced with IUU fishing vessels, stressing that the current paragraph did not effectively address situations where a vessel had fled their jurisdiction.  40"
WCPFC7,264,"The EU has tabled a proposal by adding the coastal states in para 15 c) of CMM 2007-03 as follows…..”the case regarding the vessel or vessels that conducted IUU fishing activities has been settled to the satisfaction of the CCM that originally submitted the vessel for listing, of the Coastal State (if different from the former) and of the flag State involved”."
WCPFC7,265,"The Chair summarized the issues, noting that if violations take place in an EEZ, and the vessel leaves, and the flag State does not take adequate measures, then the coastal State has no recourse. He suggested members develop a mechanism to get flag States to take action to punish violations in a way that is commensurate with the violation."
WCPFC7,266,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members, thanked members who participated in the discussion, and proposed that the Commission revisit the decision taken by WCPFC5 with regard to application of IUU conservation and management measures: “WCPFC5 agreed that further development of guidelines for how the Commission should consider and assess the adequacy of any actions taken, or sanctions imposed, in relation to CMM 2007-03 should be a priority work item and referred the matter to TCC5. It was noted that work on a control of national measures may inform this process” (WCPFC5 Report, para 161).  FFA members noted that the TCC5 summary report contains no evidence the issue was considered, and urged that the decision be revisited and TCC7 be directed as a matter of priority to consider the matter, and consider the issues in para 157 of the WCPFC5 report."
WCPFC7,267,"WCPFC7 directed TCC7 to satisfy the following request made by WCPFC5: “WCPFC5 agreed that further development of guidelines for how the Commission should consider and assess the adequacy of any actions taken, or sanctions imposed, in relation to CMM 2007-03 should be a priority work item and referred the matter to TCC5.” It was noted that work on a control of national’s measure may inform this process."
WCPFC7,268,"New Zealand introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-05, which is the result of intersessional work from TCC6 on the issue of the 120-day rule in CMM 2007-03. The paper includes a summary from New Zealand, and a comparative table of dates and suggestions received from Japan, Chinese Taipei and FFA members for consideration by WCPFC7.  (iii) 120-day rule"
WCPFC7,269,"CCMs voiced support for the measure, with Japan noting the difficulty it experienced in proposing a vessel for IUU listing in 2010 because of the timing restriction. FSM, on behalf of FFA members, indicated their interest in pursuing an intersessional listing process in the future."
WCPFC7,270,WCPFC7 adopted WCPFC7-2010-DP-05 amending the 120-day rule in CMM 2007-03 to the 70 day rule (Attachment U). 9.1.2 CMM 2008-01 — para 46 Extension of CMM 2008-01 and others
WCPFC7,271,"The Philippines introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-01, recommending (a) thorough consideration and discussion of the extension of closures of high seas pockets 1 and 2; (b) designation of high seas pocket 1 as a special management area for small and medium fresh/ice-chilled fishing vessels; (c) implementation of  proportionate reduction of fishing effort (reduction of national fleet capacity); and (d) implementation of proportionate bigeye tuna catch limits for all fleets (purse seine, longline, etc). (i) High seas pockets special management area"
WCPFC7,272,"CCMs expressed sympathy with the socioeconomic difficulties faced by the Philippines, and noted the importance of reducing the impacts of fishing in the western tropical areas of the WCPO to ensure stock sustainability."
WCPFC7,273,"Several CCMs voiced support for the request by the Philippines to establish a special management area, noting the vital role played by such fisheries in local communities. Other 41  CCMs noted that WCPFC7-2010-15. Rev 1 made it clear that the closure of high seas pockets provided no conservation benefit, with purse-seine effort about 10% higher than the previous record level in 2008-2009, and voiced support for review of CMM 2008-01 in its entirety by WCPFC7. FFA Members stated they were not able to support the proposal to amend CMM 2008-01 as proposed by the Philippines at WCPFC7, and did not support a comprehensive review of CMM 2008-01 by WCPFC7, but welcomed consideration of the Philippines proposal as part of a review of CMM 2008-01 in 2011."
WCPFC7,274,"The Philippines further introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-24, containing a proposed amendment to CMM 2008-01, and proposed DP-24 serve as a working paper for discussion by the proposed WG on CMM 2008-01. The Philippines informed the Commission that there was an understanding between the Philippines and PNA countries to have further discussions on the high seas pockets special management area as soon as possible to work out arrangements for remedial measures to be implemented in early 2011."
WCPFC7,275,"The Marshall Islands on behalf of the PNA stated “ Some PNA parties have met informally with the Philippines delegation on the issue of the High Seas pockets access. We sympathise with their situation domestically and note the many commonalities with Philippines, Indonesia and PNA parties in the areas of domestic capacity, aspirations and the impact of conservation measures on our domestic industries."
WCPFC7,276,"Mr Chairman, we wish it to be noted that in the new year PNA, and we would hope broader FFA, will work closely with the Philippines government and industry to come to amicable solutions to this without undermining the measures in place”."
WCPFC7,277,"WCPFC7 noted the agreement reached between the Philippines and the PNA to further discuss the proposal and if possible present a mutually agreeable solution to the Commission intersessionally. WCPFC7 agreed to also consider WCPFC7-2010-DP-01 and WCPFC7-2010-DP-24 as part of the CMM 2008-01 review process (para.  308, below)."
WCPFC7,278,"Japan spoke to WCPFC7-2010-DP-02, proposing a new CMM addressing purse seine fishing capacity and effort, explaining it was an emergency step to stop the increase in purse seiner catch during 2011, while the Commission considers revision of CMM 2008-01. Japan commented that in their view:  (ii) Preliminary Analysis of Purse Seine Increase i. the unforeseen expansion of purse seine fishing activities while other fishing activities decline. Purse seine effort increased 30%–40% over the last 3 years, the inverse of the expected reduction in fishing effort over 2008–2011. The bigeye tuna catch by purse seine fleet increased by 40%, while longline catch decreased by 20%, and will decrease by a further 10% in 2011. Japan noted the situation created under  CMM 2008-01 was unfair.  ii. Japan believes that the scientific analysis indicates bigeye tuna are in trouble, yellowfin is close, and skipjack is declining rapidly. The skipjack analysis was based on 2009 data, and the situation may be worse in 2011. Japan noted the purse seine catch of skipjack exceeded 1 million mt in 2002, and reached 1.6 million mt in 2010, a 60% increase over 8 years. The rapid increase in purse seine skipjack catch reflects a rapid increase in the activities of purse seine fishing vessels. iii. Japan noted that the Convention calls for application of an ecosystem and precautionary approach, but that current fishing operations were in direct opposition to that approach. Japan stated that the rapid increase in fishing activities causes difficulties for coastal fishing operations, and noted clear declines in coastal waters. 42  iv. Japan warned the Commission that actions were being taken by members to promote their own interests, with almost no corrective action taken in timely manner. It noted investors were looking for opportunities to build large US$20 million purse seine vessels, and seeking short term profits; the ensuing struggle between members prevents Commission members from stopping the uncontrolled increase in the fishing cap.  v. Japan noted its strong support for Pacific Island development and protection of small-scale sustainable fisheries, noting significant reduction in its own long linefleet, and urged members to halt the introduction of additional purse seine vessels to the Convention Area, except for replacement of existing vessels.  vi. Japan noted that coastal states should decide who should fish and how much in their waters. If coastal states want to increase their own fleet then they have to exclude distant water fishing nations from their zones. Coastal states have to show their strong will to control fishing in their zones. Unfortunately current situation is like a too crowded bus passengers are coming and coming but nobody is getting off."
WCPFC7,279,"China thanked Japan, and stated that it encouraged its industry to establish processing plants, and reflag its vessels to PICs. China noted that a number of vessels were planned or under construction, and could not be halted by China’s national legislation or WCPFC CMMs; such pressures would place additional pressure on bigeye and skipjack stocks. China agreed with Japan to ban any growth in the purse seine fleet in the Convention Area."
WCPFC7,280,"The EU voiced support for the Japanese proposal, noting the EU had maintained its effort at the same level for many years, and Japan’s proposal was an emergency measure that would be added to other elements."
WCPFC7,281,"The Philippines noted that it had a moratorium on new fishing vessels in place since 1998, with new vessels allowed only to replace existing larger or equivalent vessels."
WCPFC7,282,"Palau speaking on behalf of FFA members noted they remained committed to basing the management of the tropical purse seine fishery on effort limits through the PNA Vessel Day Scheme, and indicated interest in the scope for a system of purse seine capacity limits to complement and support the VDS, and indicated they would consider Japan’s proposal in their work during 2011 on measures to replace CMM 2008-01."
WCPFC7,283,"The USA supported Japan’s proposal, and further noted that capacity should be reduced, through work by the Commission that identifies a proper level of purse seine capacity, and respects the aspirations of SIDS through reductions in distant water fishing nation (DWFN) capacity."
WCPFC7,284,France supported limits on capacity and the entry of new vessels.
WCPFC7,285,"Korea noted its support for the general concept in principle, but emphasized that better techniques were needed for reducing the bigeye tuna purse-seine catch through CMM 2008-01, rather than through limits on capacity that would affect skipjack and yellowfin catches, which it viewed as stable. Korea advocated implementing limits on SIDS gradually, to allow them to develop their fisheries and capacity."
WCPFC7,286,"Nauru spoke on behalf of the PNA and noted that capacity limits had been used by the PNA for many years, but were considered to be a very blunt tool; the PNA instituted effort limit instead to provide more control over who fishes in their waters. It noted that any scheme should not limit the rights of coastal states to choose and should complement more advanced limit approaches."
WCPFC7,287,"Marshall Islands agreed with Nauru, and stated that PNA would impose tighter control of its VDS in 2011. It urged developed members to undertake voluntary capacity reduction. 43"
WCPFC7,288,"FFA members stated that they assumed that under para 1 the high seas capacity limit in para 3 would not apply to SIDS’ domestic purse-seine development, and would enable SIDS to participate in the high seas purse seine fishery. They agreed with Japan that greater attention be given to skipjack management in accordance with SC advice, and noted they were considering additional measures to complement the VDS, potentially including purse seine capacity limits"
WCPFC7,289,"Guam supported the proposal by Japan, and asked that CCMs recognize the importance of fish stocks to SIDS communities and the role of artisanal fisheries as they were striving to maximize the economic benefits of the fishery. It noted the poor state of fish stocks in Guam."
WCPFC7,290,"Canada noted it shared concerns with the overcapacity of the purse-seine fleet in the WCPO. In the Kobe II workshop efforts were made to include language on capacity, and such a freeze should not constrain access to fisheries by developing states. Canada noted that the Japanese proposal was long overdue, and expressed the hope that members would agree to a significantly strengthened measure to replace CMM 2008-01 in 2011."
WCPFC7,291,PNG stated that DWFNs should cut their effort.
WCPFC7,292,"New Zealand shared the concerns raised by Japan, and noted the results of the most recent skipjack stock assessment. It stated it would be difficult to reduce capacity if it increases further, but observed that Japan’s proposal lacked the flexibility called for by the PNA and FFA."
WCPFC7,293,"Japan voiced appreciation for the support expressed by members, and expressed willingness to work with FFA to implement effort or capacity controls in conjunction with PNA measures, while urging the Commission to agree to the principle of implementing a fishing effort or capacity cap."
WCPFC7,294,"Nauru stated it was committed to halting or reversing the expansion of purse seine capacity, but that PNA members would not agree to freeze capacity in its current balance, in which most vessels are from DWFN."
WCPFC7,295,"Chinese Taipei noted that CMM 2008-01 was effective for longliners, but not for purse seine vessels, and urged all delegates to consider how to more effectively conserve bigeye tuna. It advocated an interim freeze, and introduction of a comprehensive replacement of CMM 2008-01 in 2011."
WCPFC7,296,"The Cook Islands, on behalf of FFA members, reiterated their support for capacity fishery limits that do not constrain access to, development of, and benefits from sustainable tuna fisheries by developing countries, on the basis that FFA members’ sovereign rights to determine who they will license in their waters and their right to participate in high seas fishing are recognized. They also noted the FAO definition of capacity, which was endorsed by the WCPFC: “The amount of fish (or fishing effort) that can be produced over a period of time (e.g. a year or a fishing season) by a vessel or a fleet if fully utilized and for a given resource condition.”"
WCPFC7,297,"Samoa thanked Japan for its proposal, noting FFA members supported the development by DWFNs of proposals that complement actions taken by SIDS in their EEZs."
WCPFC7,298,"A number of CCMs indicated they had vessels under construction or in the planning stage. Several FFA members noted that some CCMs have suggested that all new builds need prior approval by Commission members. Those FFA members noted that actions taken by the Commission or its members must not impact or limit development of their fisheries, including building new vessels. It was noted by the Chair that Resolution 2008-01, Article 30 of the Convention and various SIDS provisions in individual CMMs make it clear that there is no need for Commission approval and in fact provide an obligation on members to commit to assisting SIDS develop their fisheries.  44"
WCPFC7,299,A lengthy discussion focused on the continuation of elements of CMM 2008-01 beyond 2011 if no agreement was reached on a replacement The USA reminded the Commission of a decision taken by TCC6 (TCC 6 report para 234) that recommends that such a decision be made. At TCC differing views were expressed on the meaning of para 46 of CMM 2008-01. The USA stated its view that CMM 2008-01 should persist if not replaced.
WCPFC7,300,"The Legal Adviser stated that CMM 2008-01 required annual review, but would remain in place unless an alternate measure is adopted. The overall measure will not expire, but there are specific time-bound actions. Thus specific provisions on purse seine measures and longline measures are time-bound, with some set for 2009, and others for 2010 and 2011. Those actions would terminate as indicated in 2011. One measure relating to the high seas closure will not expire, because of a paragraph at the end indicating it will continue after a review in 2009."
WCPFC7,301,"FFA Members stated they were committed to adopt a comprehensive CMM at WCPFC8 to replace CMM 2008-01, but urged the Commission to take a decision that all the provisions of the CMM will continue to apply, as they apply in 2011, until they are replaced to avoid a situation in 2011 where partial arrangements would continue to apply in an unfair or ineffective manner. FFA members also noted that CMM 2008-01 (para 36) states that the catch limit for China for 2009 and 2010 will remain at 2004 levels pending agreement being reached to develop an arrangement for the attribution of Chinese catch taken as part of domestic fisheries in the EEZs of SIDS. The paragraph is silent about any limit for China for 2011, but in the view of FFA members anticipates that the Commission will establish a bigeye longline catch limit for China for 2011 consistent with the 30% reductions being applied to the catch limits of other large longline fleets. FFA estimates the bigeye catch by Chinese longline vessels operating as part of the domestic fleets of several SIDS in 2004 at 1,824 mt; the limit established for China for 2009 and 2010 in Attachment F of CMM 2008-01 was 9,314 mt. Thus the applicable baseline catch for China would have been 7,490 mt; with a 30% reduction the limit for China for 2011 would be 5,243 mt. FFA members noted it was appropriate that a reduction be applied to the catch limit for China for 2011 because the difficulty with establishing an appropriate catch limit arises from the failure of China to provide operational level data as required under the Commission’s Data Rules."
WCPFC7,302,China noted the need to consider the issue with FFA.
WCPFC7,303,"The Philippines noted it would be premature to consider an extension of CMM 2008-01 without a review, and noted that Article 46 states that decisions must be taken in light of scientific advice."
WCPFC7,304,"Nauru noted its reservations regarding a piecemeal management through various CMMs, and urged the Commission to develop a strategic approach to management; it also suggested that work on reference points should be fast-tracked."
WCPFC7,305,"Several CCMs agreed CMM 2008-01 needs improvement, with ambiguities removed and effectiveness reinforced, and noted some 80% of the bigeye catch in the WCPO is in national waters, and only 20% in the high seas."
WCPFC7,306,"The Chair stated that the concerns expressed by Japan were backed by analyses of the Scientific Services Provider. He noted that the proposed or ongoing construction of some 40 new purse-seine vessels, all larger than those that are currently fishing now, posed a significant problem. He reviewed the declining status of available resources, and noted that — having failed to reduce the purse seine catch — the Commission’s credibility was at stake, and it needed to take urgent measures to address the situation for specific stocks. He noted PNA attempts to reduce effort through the VDS, but observed that regional capacity was already sufficient, and efforts must be made to limit overall capacity in conjunction with managing effort. He observed that further delay would result in construction of additional vessels and increased fishing effort, with 45  likely increases in IUU fishing on the high seas if in-zone fishing is controlled. He noted the need to transfer capacity from DWFNs to SIDS, and reminded members of their responsibility to promote sustainable use of the region’s fishery resources through a precautionary approach."
WCPFC7,307,"WCPFC7 agreed to consider WCPFC7-2010-DP-02, WCPFC7-2010-DP-03 and the issues raised during the discussion through the “CMM 2008-01 review process” described in para.  308 below."
WCPFC7,308,"WCPFC7 adopted WCPFC7-2010-DP-32 (Rev 3), regarding a process for 2011 to develop an enhanced conservation and management measure for tropical tunas (bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin) in the WCPO (Attachment V), as follows: i. At its 8th session in December 2011, the Commission will adopt an enhanced measure to conserve and manage tropical tunas on the basis of the advice provided by SC7 and the recommendations of TCC7.  The CMM will be based upon the most recent scientific advice, and be designed to deliver a substantial improvement in the status of the WCPO bigeye stock, and promote the conservation and management of skipjack and yellowfin in accordance with the WCPF Convention. ii. The CMM will apply to all commercial tuna fisheries (purse seine, longline and other commercial tuna fisheries) in the WCPO.   iii. The advice and recommendations will, inter alia, include consideration of the status and distribution of stocks, fairness, equity, enforceability, compatibility, multi-species effects, socio-economic factors involved and the special requirements of developing members, SIDS and territories.    iv. CCMs are encouraged to take voluntary steps to mitigate the impact of their fishing activities on the sustainability of bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin tuna and to report back on the steps they take.   v. Kobe 3 (11-15 July 2011) may present an opportunity for an initial discussion on the development of an enhanced measure for conservation and management of tropical tunas.   vi. SC7 shall consider updated assessments for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack and the results of the evaluation of the measure and projections undertaken at the request of SC6, and will provide advice and recommendations that will support the development of an enhanced measure for conservation and management of tropical tunas. On the basis of the advice provided by SC7, the Chair and the Vice-chair of the Commission, assisted by the Executive Director and other Commission subsidiary body Chairs as appropriate, will prepare a preliminary document containing a possible approach and options for the enhanced measure to be considered by TCC7. vii. TCC7 will consider the preliminary document prepared by the Chair and Vice-Chair and provide advice and recommendations, for consideration by WCPFC8. viii. All CCMs are encouraged to share proposals with other CCMs and with the Commission Chair as early as possible in 2011, to maximize the opportunity for developing options for an enhanced measure for consideration at WCPFC8.  ix. CCMs are encouraged to reflect on Resolution 2008-01 in the preparation of proposals for an enhanced measure.  9.1.3 CMM 2009-06 — Conservation and Management Measure on the Regulation of Transshipment"
WCPFC7,309,The Compliance Manager summarized the questions that the Secretariat had received regarding implementation of CMM 2009-06. These include: confusion regarding the observer provisions and lack of clarity of where to submit the  transshipment declarations.  46
WCPFC7,310,"Solomon Islands on behalf of the FFA stated that CMM 2009-06 needs to be read in conjunction with 2009-01- WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels and Authorization to Fish. CMM 2009-01 indicates in para. 30 that once a CNM vessel is on the vessel register, it is equivalent to a CCM-flagged vessel, and must comply with all relevant CMM’s. Thus the transshipment observer provisions of CMM 2009-06 apply to carriers on the interim register."
WCPFC7,311,"In accordance with CMM 2007-01 and the decision of WCPFC2, carriers, like other vessels, are free to choose ROP observers of non nationals of the flag state from the authorized national observer programs, or from the existing sub-regional programs, except for vessels covered by para 14 (ii) of CMM 2007-01. FFA members noted that if a bunker vessel did receive fish from another vessel, it would be a “receiving vessel” and therefore subject to 2009-06 the whole measure in the same way that other vessels are. FFA members also noted that the reporting requirements of the measure (in paras. 10, 11 and 12) also apply in cases where WCPO-caught fish is transshipped elsewhere."
WCPFC7,312,"Japan noted while, who is responsible for funding is an issue to be addressed, practical approach can be taken in operations because no transshipment can be allowed without observers on board."
WCPFC7,313,China noted the urgent need to allocate funds to pay observers and resolve proposals for cross-endorsement of observers.
WCPFC7,314,"The USA and FFA members stated that CMM 2009-06 could be implemented without further clarification, while the EU stated that the measure was not clear. The Chair advised the USA to provide clarification to the EU."
WCPFC7,315," Noting that they were already in force, the Commission agreed with the Executive Director’s suggestion that the issues raised by WCPFC7-2010-13 and WCPFC7-2010-30 be addressed intersessionally and brought to TCC7 to ensure consistent application.  9.1.4 CMM 2007-04 — Seabird By-Catch Mitigation"
WCPFC7,316,"ACAP advised CCMs that considerable progress had been made in recent years in respect to mitigation of longline impacts on seabirds. He indicated that ACAP hoped a new set of guidelines on mitigation measures would be available in 2011, and noted progress on safety aspects of using leads on branch lines, which should result in much safer operations. ACAP sought support for having these items reviewed by the SC at its next meeting."
WCPFC7,317,"ACAP commented that there had been numerous references to the lack of data hampering the Commission’s work, and said that a similar lack of data on seabird bycatch hampered ACAP’s ability to advise the Commission. ACAP noted that the ecological risk assessments presented and discussed at the SC over the previous few years enabled the Commission to undertake a very targeted observer programme that focused on areas of highest seabird interaction and need. ACAP proposed that a targeted observer programme be undertaken in one of the hot spots identified in the Tasman Sea to assist in the review of CMM 2007-04, and indicated it would consult with relevant parties who fish in that region in the coming months to identify data gaps, and develop approaches to cooperation."
WCPFC7,318,"New Zealand stated that the approach of a targeted observer programme as proposed by ACAP could be very cost effective and useful, and indicated this could be further considered by the Commission at TCC and SC. It encouraged other fishing nations to get involved."
WCPFC7,319,"The USA suggested that the design of the ROP should be guided by advice from the SC, and should work to implement the plan proposed by the SC and agreed to by the Commission. 9.1.5 Others to be discussed 47  CMM 2005-02 — South Pacific Albacore"
WCPFC7,320,"PNG introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-08 on behalf of FFA Members, requesting that CMM 2005-02 be clarified and require that CCMs report to the Commission the total number of vessels that caught South Pacific albacore, and the total catch in tonnes for vessels catching albacore south of 20°S."
WCPFC7,321,"A number of CCMs expressed support for the proposal. Some concerns were expressed about reporting thresholds for South Pacific albacore bycatch, and for application of the measure to vessels that do not target south Pacific albacore."
WCPFC7,322,"WCPFC7 adopted WCPFC7-2010-DP-08 (rev 1) to revise CMM 2005-02 (Attachment W) with the understanding that some CMMs may not be able to provide separate data for bycatch and targeted catch of South Pacific albacore prior to 2005. CCMs shall make their best efforts to do so, and post 2005 catch data for South Pacific albacore must distinguish between targeted catch and bycatch.  CMM 2007-01 — Regional Observer Programme"
WCPFC7,323,"The Secretariat spoke to the data flow obligations of CCMs under CMM 2007-01, as addressed in WCPFC7-2010-13.  It noted that the poor provision of ROP data to the Secretariat and its Scientific Services Provider (SPC) negatively impacts the Commission’s ability to carry out its work and receive appropriate reports for sustainable and responsible fisheries management. There is a need to clarify the definition of the ROP and the obligations of Members with respect to the security and timely flow of data to both the Secretariat and SPC, with a mechanism to assist members who have difficulties meeting the ROP data criteria. CCM data flow obligations"
WCPFC7,324,"Japan introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-19 on behalf of the EU, Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei, in relation to release of ROP reports. They proposed that Annex A of CMM 2007-01 be modified, and specify that observer providers be responsible for ensuring (i) timely provision of draft observer reports to vessel operators/captains as well as to the competent authority in the flag CCM upon completion of their observer trips, and (ii) the opportunity for vessel operators/captains to review and comment on the observer reports under paragraph 1.c), Annex B.” They noted that the data was very useful for compliance as well as scientific research, and this would be facilitated through the proposed modification to CMM 2007-01.  ROP report release"
WCPFC7,325,"Some CCMs indicated that the issues raised needed to be considered further to determine their impact on observers and national observer programs, and suggested the proposal be deferred to TCC7. Other CCMs noted the proposal was essentially a guideline for existing para 1(c) of Annex B implementation, and could be implemented without delay, stressing the need for flag States to receive observer reports as soon as possible in order to be able to exercise their duty of responsible control over own flagged vessels. One CCM stressed the need to set forth the rights and responsibilities of the various parties more clearly, and another indicated the information would be useful should legal action be required. A CCM noted the proposed paragraph should indicate why the competent authority should receive the observer report, and noted it should be made available to all those who should receive it at the same time."
WCPFC7,326,"The Observer Programme Coordinator indicated that there were operational difficulties raised by the proposal, highlighting costs, reporting delays due to travel delays, the possible need for observer debriefing, and problems that could arise if an observer made multiple trips on the same vessel.  48"
WCPFC7,327,"He also noted that the Secretariat was currently receiving no data, and that no funds were available to enter data in 2010."
WCPFC7,328,"FFA noted that there were significant differences between ROP data and observer reports, and that captains were able to review but not keep observer reports, while Flag states could receive ROP data."
WCPFC7,329,The EU confirmed not having been able to access any observer data and that masters of EU flagged vessels had never received reports for review.
WCPFC7,330,"WCPFC7 failed to reach consensus on WCPFC7-2010-DP-19, and directed TCC7 to consider the issues raised in the paper.   CMM 2007-02 — VMS"
WCPFC7,331,"The USA introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-14, regarding the need for Commission consideration and approval of requests by CCMs to include waters under their national jurisdiction within the area covered by the Commission VMS, as specified in CMM 2007-02, para. 6(c). The USA outlined its concern that such requests and approvals were characterized in the WCPFC6 meeting record as being a bilateral issue, while CMM 2007-02 is clear that they require Commission consideration and approval; the USA stressed that CMMs should be implemented in the specified manner."
WCPFC7,332,The USA suggested that the Commission approve the application of CMM 2007-02 to all CCMs’ waters as a whole if requested by a CCM. The Secretariat would advise the Commission if a request was made by a CCM for application of the VMS to its waters. A proposed template of terms and conditions would be developed by the Secretariat for this purpose.
WCPFC7,333,"In response to a query, the Compliance Manager indicated that the VMS currently collects data regarding EEZs, and the Commission pays for that data, but the data is quarantined, and countries and the Commission do not see it. The proposed access arrangement would enable members to see data of Commission vessels in their EEZ. There would be costs associated with data access only if a member requested an increase in the polling rate for vessels. He noted that of the approximately 1,500 vessels registered exclusively on the Commission VMS, only 20%-30% are on high seas; about 70% are in member EEZs, but that data is not visible, despite being paid for by the Commission."
WCPFC7,334,"China noted that for some coastal states maritime boundaries have not been finalized, and suggested a conflict could occur if several Commission members asked that their EEZs be included, and those did not agree on the boundaries. The Chair noted that language could be added to the effect that exercise of the Commission VMS would neither determine disputed boundaries nor prejudice the establishment of maritime boundaries of states."
WCPFC7,335,"WCPFC7 adopted WCPFC7-2010-DP-27 (Rev 1) (Attachment X), while noting that the inclusion of waters under the national jurisdiction of a member of the Commission within the area covered by the Commission VMS will not determine any disputed boundary and will be without prejudice to the final determination of such boundaries. CMM 2009-06 — Transshipment"
WCPFC7,336,Discussed under agenda item 7.1 and Item 9.1.3.    9.2 Report by PNA Members on implementation of the Vessel Day Scheme
WCPFC7,337,"Marshall Islands presented WCPFC7-2010-DP-23 (Rev 1), on implementation of the Vessel Day Scheme. 49"
WCPFC7,338,"In response to a query, Marshall Islands indicated that 8 PNA members had amalgamated their zones to the VDS. Implementation and monitoring is undertaken in conjunction with the FFA, using the VMS to monitor all fleets in PNA waters. All bilateral agreements are taken into account in the VDS. In the future tighter control will be exercised with fewer vessel days. The VDS includes domestic vessels under the FSM arrangement."
WCPFC7,339,"New Zealand commended the PNA for its report, for the forecast operational improvements, implementation of fixed limits, and restrictions on the transfer of days between management years."
WCPFC7,340,The EU suggested that future reports could address the effectiveness of VMS implementation on conservation of tropical tuna stocks.
WCPFC7,341,"The Marshall Island noted this could be addressed by SPC, and that future limits would remove some effort, or 15%-20% of vessels."
WCPFC7,342,"PNG stressed that the PNA had additional measures under its third implementing arrangements, and was the first to achieve 100% observer and VMS coverage. It noted that in 2011 PNG was spending $1 million per year on its observer programme, and building a web-based VMS."
WCPFC7,343,WCPFC7 noted the Report by PNA Members on implementation of the Vessel Day Scheme 9.3 Consideration of new measures and other conservation requirements 9.3.1 North Pacific Striped Marlin
WCPFC7,344,"PNG, in its capacity as chair of the FFC, and on behalf of FFA members, introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-07, which proposes a CMM calling for a phased reduction by all CCMs in their longline catch of North Pacific striped marlin, such that their annual catches starting from 1 January 2013 are 80% of their highest annual catches between 2000–2003."
WCPFC7,345,"Japan, speaking on behalf of the northern Asian countries, supported the proposal."
WCPFC7,346,"The USA noted its concern that members would take as their allowable catch 80% of the highest level in the reference period, which could increase the average catch overall, relative to the reference period, meaning the measure would have little if any  conservation benefit. It asked for confirmation on this from SPC. It noted declines in striped marlin catch, and the expected availability in 2011 of a stock assessment for striped marlin. The USA expressed its support for a measure for 1 year, with consideration of a revised CMM when the stock assessment results are available."
WCPFC7,347,Several CCMs supported the position taken by the USA.
WCPFC7,348,"A CCM voiced support for passage of the measure, noting that not all CCMs were likely to catch their full allocation. It indicated the measure was designed around percentage reductions, and could be easily revised on the basis of a stock assessment."
WCPFC7,349,"Dr. John Hampton (SPC) noted total catch had declined quite rapidly since the early 2000s. The allocations to members under the measure would allow a total catch of some 2,400 mt, somewhat higher than the current level. Reducing the catch relative to recent yearswould necessitate using a more recent base year or increasing the percentage reduction."
WCPFC7,350,"Following further discussion CCMs agreed to a measure for North pacific Striped marlin subject to the text including consideration of the following proposed amendments:  i. the measure will be amended in 2011 on the basis of the 2011 stock assessment results;  50  ii. the measure will eliminate references to fishing using longline gear and apply to all gear types; iii. the measure will call for a 10% reduction in 2011, 15% in 2012, 20% in 2013 and beyond subject to amendment in 2011;  iv. members will be encouraged to implement and test gear modifications that may assist with reduction of north Pacific striped marlin catch and inform amendment of the measure in 2011."
WCPFC7,351,WCPFC7 adopted WCPFC7-2010-DP-07 Rev 2 as amended as a CMM (CMM 2010-01) (Attachment Y). 9.3.2 Port State Measures
WCPFC7,352,"The EU introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-13, proposing a new CMM intended to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing through the implementation of effective port State measures (PSM) to control the harvest of fish caught in the WCPF Convention Area. The EU noted it had received various comments from members on an earlier draft presented to TCC6 and intersessionally."
WCPFC7,353,"Fiji and Niue on behalf of FFA members thanked the EU and indicated the revised CMM took into account the concerns raised regarding the protection of the sovereignty of the port State and the exercise of sovereign rights over EEZs.  They noted the significant implications for national institutions and resources, and the effects that capacity and resource constraints can have on implementation of port State measures, and sought clarity regarding the provision of financial and other assistance. They noted their view that a PSM should not apply to (i) foreign fishing vessels already licensed by the relevant port State CCM; and (ii) vessels fishing solely in waters under the sovereignty of the relevant port State CCM."
WCPFC7,354,"France strongly supported the PSM as a tool to combat IUU fishing, stating that most notifications come from inspections in the ports in their territories. Another CMM also commented on the effectiveness of PSMs in combating and eliminating IUU fishing."
WCPFC7,355,"The Chair stated that there are a number of CMMs that had been adopted that refer to port state responsibilities, which must all be reconciled. He observed that the EU proposal incorporated the essence of the FAO Port State Agreement, which had been agreed to by the broader international community, into a WCPFC CMM, and noted the need to address: (i) possible discordance between the proposal and existing WCPFC CMMs; (ii) exemptions for certain kinds of vessels; (iii) costs borne by CCMs; (iv) differences in definitions (e.g. what constitutes “fishing” and “fishing related activities”)."
WCPFC7,356,"The EU noted that the PSM proposal contains specific references to funding to support implementation capacities of SIDS. Some flexibility would be possible to adjust the proposal to the specific regional context. But there are some fundamental basic principles that stem from the PSM Agreement adopted by consensus at FAO and those cannot be modified. The EU agreed to progress the work intersessionally, while being faithful to what was achieved through the FAO process."
WCPFC7,357,"WCPFC7 directed TCC7 to consider the issue of Port State Measures, and any progress made intersessionally by the EU and other CCMs on the issue.  9.3.3 Eastern High Seas Pocket Special Management Area-"
WCPFC7,358,"Cook Islands introduced (i) WCPFC7-2010-DP-04, proposing a new CMM intended to reduce IUU fishing in the eastern high seas pocket of the Convention Area, including through specific vessel reporting requirements and provision of near real-time VMS information related to 51  the eastern high seas pocket to adjacent coastal states/territories for monitoring purposes, and (ii) WCPFC7-2010-IP-07, supporting the proposal in DP-04."
WCPFC7,359,"Several CCMs strongly supported the proposal by Cook Islands, noting their concern with what is happening in this area, where there is significant fishing effort. They noted fleets must transit through coastal State waters, leaving those waters vulnerable to IUU fishing activities, and that it was essential to develop additional MCS tools, such as that proposed by the Cook Islands. One CCM further noted that poaching was occurring in many other areas as well, including targeting of sharks by small longline vessels, and proposed application of the measure to high seas areas adjacent to EEZ areas."
WCPFC7,360,"FFA members supported the proposal, noting that the role of high seas pockets as a haven for IUU fishing and as a base for incursions into EEZs had been discussed repeatedly, and that the measure addressed the specific objective of enhancing MCS opportunities without overly impacting upon vessels legitimately fishing in the eastern high seas pocket. They indicated that the additional requirements were not onerous and represent a practical solution to an issue that has resulted in significant losses to the neighboring coastal States, which include two SIDS and one Territory."
WCPFC7,361,"One CCM supported the proposal in principle but called for further consideration of a ban on transshipment in the area, and indicated they would need precise coordinates for the area attached to the CMM if adopted. Another CCM did not support the proposal, indicating concern that the request would interfere with freedom of navigation and the high seas as enjoyed by all members, and noted there was no justification to require notification by all fishing vessels prior to entry. It expressed concern that enforcement of such a measure would require significant human resources on the part of the Commission and flag CCMs."
WCPFC7,362,"Several CCMs suggested the proposal by Cook Islands be put in place and monitored for effectiveness prior to extension to other areas. It was noted that the VMS programme could be used more widely by members in this regard, and that a provision allowed VMS data to be made available within 100 miles outside the EEZ of a coastal state on request to the Secretariat."
WCPFC7,363,"New Zealand supported the proposal as a very effective mechanism for combating IUU fishing while still allowing legitimate fishing to occur. New Zealand stated it spends considerable funds in air surveillance, including in this area, and conducts patrol activities, and that activities in the eastern high seas pocket place a burden on members seeking to manage the area effectively. It suggested examining the expansion proposal at TCC7."
WCPFC7,364,"A CCM voiced the concern that that it was difficult for vessels to report operational plans 12 and 6 hours before arrival and departure, and proposed modifying the reporting time frame. It also suggested that CMM 2009-06 effectively addresses transshipment."
WCPFC7,365,"Japan noted that at present without flag State permission coastal states could not use VMS data in the buffer zone (a 100-nautical mile area extending from the outer limit of the EEZ up to 100 nautical miles into the high seas). It indicated it had significant difficulties with poaching, particularly by small longline vessels targeting sharks and other species. Japan supported a strong measure to monitor activities in the buffer zone."
WCPFC7,366,"Marshall Islands supported the proposed measure, and noted that the area is closed to purse seine activities as a condition of access to vessels licensed to fish in PNA waters."
WCPFC7,367,"Chinese Taipei stated that the Commission VMS provided near real-time data for vessels entering and leaving EEZs, and that use of the VMS data would provide the needed information without the proposed additional reporting, which would be a burden on fishing vessels. 52"
WCPFC7,368,The Philippines noted the similarity between the proposals by Cook Islands and that made by the Philippines and asked for support for its proposal for a special management area in the western closed high seas pocket No. 1.
WCPFC7,369,"Following further discussion and amendment, the Commission adopted the measure, noting that the extension of the Special Management Area to buffer zones would be revisited by TCC7."
WCPFC7,370,"WCPFC7 adopted WCPFC7-2010-DP-04 (rev 1) as a CMM (CMM 2010-02) (Attachment Z), and directed TCC7 to consider extension of the Special Management Area to buffer zones. 9.3.4 Committee on Compliance with Conservation Measures"
WCPFC7,371,"Australia introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-12, proposing a new CMM to implement a compliance monitoring scheme (CMS). At WCPFC6, the Commission approved Australia’s proposal to convene intersessional discussions on a CMS through the Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures (CCMM) Working Group, in accordance with TORs in WCPFC6-2009-DP-17. In 2010, Australia developed a working paper outlining options for a structure and process for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (WCPFC-TCC6-2010-21) which was circulated to the CCMM Working Group, and discussed at TCC6; the latter recommended that the Commission continue to progress work on the CMS through the CCMM Working Group, with Australia to lead the process and develop a draft CMM for WCPFC7 consideration. Australia noted that the structure and process of the CMS in the draft CMM is based on the principles and graduated approach described in WCPFC-TCC6-2010-21 and discussed at TCC6, and based on the framework adopted by the Commission in 2006; and that the proposed CMS builds on existing structures and processes in place in the Commission."
WCPFC7,372,"Following initial discussion at WCPFC7, Australia presented a revised version as WCPFC7-2010-DP-28 (rev 2)."
WCPFC7,373,Fiji on behalf of the FFA members noted their full support for the Australian proposal.
WCPFC7,374,"Most CCMs voiced support for the proposal, with some concern expressed over (i) increased workload on the Secretariat, which could be addressed through an IMS or similar means; and (ii) the reliability of information from NGOs, and problems that could arise from allowing NGO participation as proposed in the CCMM CMM. One CCM suggested adopting a phased approach to implementation."
WCPFC7,375,"The Chair summarized the discussion and acknowledged that involvement by NGOs was a delicate issue. He reflected on his past experience in various committees and governance bodies and suggested that the benefits of allowing interested parties to make information available outweighed the drawbacks. He noted that NGOs ultimately did not make decisions in bodies such as the Commission, but that they could submit very constructive suggestions, and allowing NGOs to make contributions could diffuse many problems; he cited the effectiveness of this approach in development of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement."
WCPFC7,376,"The Commission requested Australia to continue to work intersessionally through the Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures Working Group to develop a process that will identify a range of possible responses to non-compliance (as provided in paragraph 23 of CMM 2010-03), and report to TCC7."
WCPFC7,377,WCPFC7 adopted WCPFC7-2010-DP-28 (Rev 2) as CMM 2010-03 (Attachment AA).    53  9.3.5 Pacific Bluefin Tuna
WCPFC7,378,"Japan, on behalf of the NC, introduced WCPFC7-2010-35, proposing a new CMM to replace the existing one, seeking to ensure that the level of Pacific bluefin tuna fishing mortality does not increase above 2002–2004 levels."
WCPFC7,379,"CCMs discussed WCPFC7-2010-35, One CCM with domestic fisheries for the stock expressed difficulty to withdraw its reservation made in the NC meeting in September. Concern was expressed that failure to adopt a new CMM could result in CITES listing of Pacific bluefin, as was proposed for Atlantic bluefin in 2010. FFA members noted their desire to see the stock assessment of Pacific bluefin reviewed in full by the SC. FFA members also indicated that in the event that the proposed CMM failed to meet the objective of reducing fishing mortality to 2002–2004 levels, the need for stringent alternative measures — such as direct control of catches, particularly of juvenile fish — be noted when the measure is reviewed in 2012. Northern Committee meetings were held twice at the margin of the Commission meeting and finally reached consensus on measures as WCPFC-2010-35 (Rev1)."
WCPFC7,380,WCPFC7 adopted WCPFC7-2010-35 (Rev. 1) as a CMM (CMM 2010-04) (Attachment BB).
WCPFC7,381,"Japan noted that Mexico was a CNM and also fishes for Pacific bluefin tuna. It indicated that the NC intends to establish a joint working group or hold a meeting with IATTC on Pacific bluefin tuna, prior to NC7, to pursue development of a management measure for the eastern Pacific. 9.3.6 Large-Scale Purse Seine Fishing Capacity and Effort"
WCPFC7,382,Discussed under agenda item 9.1.2 (ii).   9.3.7 Closure of Additional Purse Seine Areas
WCPFC7,383,"Marshall Islands, on behalf of the PNA, introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-06, proposing a new CMM that would close all high seas areas located within 10°N and 20°S latitude and 170°E and 150°W longitude, including those already closed to purse seine fishing by virtue of para. 22 of CMM 2008-01, to all purse seine fishing from 2011 onwards. They noted concern about the transfer of effort to the east with the closure of western high seas pockets, particularly if elNino conditions were experienced in the next few years, which have traditionally seen a shift of effort into these areas where bigeye catch is known to be significantly higher than in western areas. ."
WCPFC7,384,"A number of CCMs, including FFA and PNA members, supported the proposal as complementary to actions taken by the PNA with respect to high seas closures for vessels licensed to fish in PNA waters."
WCPFC7,385,"Several CCMs opposed the measure. It was noted by individual CCMs that (i) high seas closures were not effective; (ii) WCPFC-2010-15 (Rev. 1) indicated that removal of exemptions and exclusions in CMM 2008-01 was the most effective means of reducing catch of juvenile bigeye; and (iii) with implementation of CMM 2008-01, effort had shifted to EEZs, necessitating a reduction in capacity or effort."
WCPFC7,386,"Kiribati voiced its general support, but also raised concerns regarding the proposal’s economic impact, noting there are 3 high seas areas between its island groups. It asked that the measure’s economic impacts be assessed."
WCPFC7,387,"WCPFC7 noted PNA members have already agreed to implement the closure of the additional high seas areas located within 10N and 20S latitude and 150W longitude to purse seiners that are licensed to fish in the waters of PNA from 1 January 2011. WCPFC7 agreed 54  that the proposal in WCPFC7-2010-DP-06 be further considered through the “CMM 2008-01 review process” set forth under 9.1.2 (ii), para.  308 (above). 9.3.8 Prohibition of Purse Seine Fishing Associated with Whale Sharks and Mitigating Impact of Fishing on Cetaceans"
WCPFC7,388,"Australia on behalf of FFA members, introduced (i) WCPFC7-2010-DP-09, proposing a CMM to prohibit purse seine fishing associated with whale sharks; and on behalf of Australia and New Zealand introduced (ii) WCPFC7-2010-DP-17, proposing a CMM to mitigate fishing impacts on all cetaceans through a prohibition on knowingly setting purse seine nets around cetaceans, whether alive or dead, and requiring that specific steps be taken should a cetacean be encircled. Australia noted that both measures derived from observations made during periods of increased observer coverage as a result of the FAD closure."
WCPFC7,389,"Japan spoke on behalf of the six Asian CCMs, noting they could not support the prohibition on setting on whale sharks, as this was an established traditional practice by their fishermen, and the measure would be difficult to enforce. Japan stated that cetacean interactions with the Japanese purse seine fleet were rare, and noted the need to consider what CMMs are applied by IATTC in the overlap area.. It stated that cetaceans were a sensitive issue for the Japanese government, and asked to defer the discussion to WCPFC8."
WCPFC7,390,"In relation to WCPFC7-2010-DP-09, Japan on behalf of the 6 Asian CCMs indicated that they would support the proposal if paragraphs 1-4 were removed. These paragraphs prohibit the setting of nets on whale sharks and, if they were removed, only the paragraphs referring to the steps to be taken in the event of a whale shark being inadvertently encircled would remain. FFA members did not accept this change, stating doing so would fundamentally alter the measure."
WCPFC7,391,"Several CCMs voiced support in principle for the proposals, and indicated that their laws prohibited setting on marine mammals and referring to WCPFC7-2010-IP-01 which indicates that intentional and unintentional encirclement of both cetaceans and whale sharks do occur in the fishery, resulting in a degree of mortality."
WCPFC7,392," FFA members noted the vulnerability of whale sharks to fishing pressure and stated that they deserved extra protection from the Commission, and that the language used in the measure was consistent with provisions for release of sea turtles in CMM 2008-03."
WCPFC7,393,Greenpeace noted its support for the proposals and indicated it would undertake market engagement work in support of the measures.
WCPFC7,394,"One CCM indicated the proposal on cetaceans should be dealt with by the International Whaling Commission, and not by the Commission."
WCPFC7,395,"Several CCMs stressed that the Convention provided the Commission the mandate to adopt measures mandating conservation of non-target and associated species, as already undertaken through measures on seabirds and turtles."
WCPFC7,396,Australia noted that best practice guidelines for the safe handling and release of encircled animals should be considered by SC7. The USA emphasized that in developing these best practices the Commission consult closely with industry.
WCPFC7,397,"The Commission noted the PNA members have agreed to adopt measures to mitigate the impacts of purse seine fishing on whale sharks, including banning setting on whale sharks from 1 Jan 2011 in their waters. The Commission took note of the advice in WCPFC7-2010-IP-01, which highlighted that there are incidental and inadvertent interactions with whale sharks and cetaceans in purse-seine sets.  The Commission requested SC7 to develop best practice guidelines for the safe release and handling of encircled animals and advise on practical ways to make these available to fishing vessels, for 55  consideration by WCPFC8, taking note that the safety of the vessel crew will also be fully considered. These best practice guidelines should be guided by collaborative research between the SC, TCC and industry. The use of ROP reports and experience of senior ROP observers should be considered in seeking practical, cost-effective mitigation procedures."
WCPFC7,398,"The Commission agreed to address the issues raised by WCPFC7-2010-DP-09 and WCPFC7-2010-DP-17 at SC7, TCC7, and WCPFC8.  9.3.9 Implementation of the ROP for Fresh-fish Fishing Vessels North of 20°N"
WCPFC7,399,"Japan, on behalf of NC, introduced WCPFC7-2010-36, proposing a CMM setting forth requirements for implementation of the ROP for fresh-fish, fishing vessels north of 20°N latitude.  i. FFA members raised several concerns, including:  ii. their own domestic longline vessels will be subject to a minimum 5% observer coverage rate by 2012, and they  are unwilling to accept final observer requirements for northern vessels that differ from the conditions imposed on other longline vessels; iii. provisions of the proposal allow the NC to issue further exemptions from observer coverage until the end of 2018, potentially allowing a large number of vessels a 5.5-year  window, and transferring a disproportionate conservation burden onto SIDS; iv. considering specific and individual applications is well beyond the mandate of the NC under the Convention rules of procedure and CMM 2007-01.  Any exemption applications would have to be considered by the TCC and the Commission, not the NC; v. there are no criteria that CCMs would have to meet or satisfy in order to apply for an exemption, and no guidance to the TCC and Commission in considering these applications, meaning that every vessel could apply and there would be no grounds to refuse applications; vi. provisions in the measure appear to provide permission for vessels to carry observers from their flag State, which is directly inconsistent with the hybrid approach upon which the ROP is built. FFA members acknowledge that there is ongoing disagreement about the terms “principally” and “occasionally”, but the proposed language goes far beyond that and provides blanket authority to carry an “own observer”."
WCPFC7,400,"Japan, on behalf of the NC, agreed to reconsider the proposal."
WCPFC7,401,WCPFC7 directed the NC to submit a revised recommended CMM on implementation of the ROP for fresh-fish fishing vessels north of 20°N to TCC7 for consideration. 9.3.10 Implementation of an EEZ Entry and Exit Notification Scheme
WCPFC7,402,"France introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-15, proposing a CMM to establish an EEZ entry and exit notification scheme. France noted the proposal aims to add a reporting scheme when entering and exiting an EEZ, would not add a large burden to vessels and states, and does not limit right of passage."
WCPFC7,403,"A number of CCMs voiced support for the proposal, and noted it complemented the proposal by Cook Islands (WCPFC7-2010-DP-04, under agenda item 9.3.3)."
WCPFC7,404,"Several CCMs opposed the proposal, noting the right of innocent passage was established under UNCLOS, and suggested it could be addressed through national legislation."
WCPFC7,405,"FFA members indicated the proposal complemented some measures already put in place and stated the CMM would greatly assist their efforts to monitor waters under national jurisdictions. FFA members have compulsory reporting requirements under their Harmonised Minimum Terms and Conditions of Access, and are amending national legislation to make it 56  compulsory for non-licensed fishing vessels to report to national surveillance authorities when transiting waters under national jurisdictions. FFA members also proposed that vessels be required to notify the nationality of the observer onboard when providing entry notifications under the measure."
WCPFC7,406,"In response to a query regarding the Commission’s mandate to require entry and exit reporting into areas of national jurisdiction, the Legal Adviser stated that all areas involved were within the Convention Area, and thus MCS measures could be applied to both the high seas and EEZs.  He noted that many countries already require entry and exit notification as part of fisheries jurisdiction under international law, and the proposal would apply this to all Commission members."
WCPFC7,407,"Several CCMs suggested members could use the Commission VMS to address many of the concerns raised. Other CCMs raised concerns that a VMS could not be used to give prior notice of entry or exit, unless a buffer arrangement through the 2009 high seas MCS data rules was in place that would enable this."
WCPFC7,408,"France agreed that the Commission VMS could be used to address the issue, but noted only three members had asked for inclusion of their EEZs inside the VMS, meaning there are large parts of the Convention Area where vessels can transit without notification. France noted it was possible to address at the national level, but more effective if done using a multilateral approach. France tabled WCPFC7-2010-DP-15 (rev 3), which sought to address a number of the concerns raised."
WCPFC7,409,"In the course of ffurther discussion, some members reiterated their support for, and others their opposition to, the proposal."
WCPFC7,410,"WCPFC directed TCC7 to consider the proposal in WCPFC7-2010-DP-15 (Rev 3), and to provide recommendations to WCPFC8. 9.3.11 Mitigating Fishing Impacts on Cetaceans"
WCPFC7,411,Discussed under agenda item 9.3.8.    9.3.12 Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS)
WCPFC7,412,Discussed under agenda item 7.2.4.    EU proposal
WCPFC7,413,Discussed under agenda item 7.2.4.    FFA members CDS guiding principles and working group TORS 9.3.13 Prohibition of Night Setting During the FAD Closure
WCPFC7,414,"Korea introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-20, proposing a CMM to prohibit night setting during FAD closures, with the intent of ensuring FAD closures are effective in avoiding juvenile bigeye catches, and minimizing the impact of FAD closures on skipjack. Korea’s proposal also required fishers to release fish when any object not identified by the observer onboard nor the master before a set was conducted is inadvertently encircled in the purse seine net, and would allow fishers to continue operations in cases when objects not previously identified by the observer onboard or the master are found drifting around a purse seine net while the net is being retrieved."
WCPFC7,415,"Japan spoke on behalf of Asian countries except Korea, and stated they could not agree to the proposal because they had concerns that the proposal would create additional loophole and make implementation difficult at sea. .  57"
WCPFC7,416,"FFA members noted their support for a ban on night setting to improve the effectiveness of the FAD closure, but did not support the proposal for greater flexibility with respect to daylight sets due to concerns that the greater flexibility would allow abuse of the FAD closure, and the need to give further consideration to how the proposed approach will be effectively monitored by observers.  FFA members (i) voiced interest in ensuring that the FAD closure is not unnecessarily burdensome for vessel operators, (ii) hoped it would be possible to develop appropriate procedures to ensure that the approach proposed by Korea to deal with inadvertent circling of floating objects can be effectively applied and monitored, and (iii) sought to work with other CCMs, including Korea, in testing the proposed approach."
WCPFC7,417,Kiribati supported previous interventions by FFA members and noted that the economics of the purse seine fishery are very important to Kiribati because of the large contribution of purse seining to government revenue and the domestic economy. They supported the idea of studying more closely how Korea’s proposed approach could be made to work in practice without putting unwelcome pressure on observers.
WCPFC7,418,"WCPFC7 agreed to include consideration of the proposal in WCPFC7-2010-DP-20 in the CMM 2008-01 review process (addressed under 9.1.2, para. 308).  9.3.14 CMM for Tropical Tunas in the Convention Area"
WCPFC7,419,"The EU introduced WCPFC7-2010-DP-26, proposing a new CMM related to CMM 2008-01, calling for replacement of the FAD closure with a full closure of purse seine fishing during 1 July – 30 September. The EU made reference to discussion that occurred under other agenda items, noting (i) CMM 2008-01 is not particularly effective in achieving conservation outcomes, as illustrated in WCPFC7-2010-15; (ii) alternatives need to be developed that do not include exemptions; (iii) there is insufficient monitoring capacity to cover the entire Convention Area."
WCPFC7,420,"FFA and PNA members stated they prefer a FAD closure to a total closure of the purse seine fishery, because a total closure: i. involves substantially greater economic losses to purse seine fleets fishing mainly in FFA waters, especially domestic vessels that have no other alternative fishing grounds; ii. disrupts supplies to local processing facilities, sustaining rather than removing excess capacity;  iii. undermines the sovereign rights of coastal states to decide how to secure reductions in fishing mortality from fishing in their waters."
WCPFC7,421,"FFA members said that a FAD closure is a more targeted species-specific measure for bigeye conservation. PNA members indicated they could support a total closure of the high seas and a FAD closure in their EEZs, and will reduce effort in 2011."
WCPFC7,422,"Japan raised the concern that the proposal constituted an indirect measure. Fishing effort may increase in other months, and some fleets may move from west to east and continue fishing and catch the same stocks. Japan supported a catch limit for the purse-seine fleet."
WCPFC7,423,WCPFC7 agreed to consider WCPFC7-2010-DP-26 through the CMM 2008-01 review process (para. 308).
WCPFC7,424,"The following list of papers considered at WCPFC 7 was referred to TCC7 and as appropriate SC7 for further discussion and development:      58  Document Number Title WCPFC-2010-DP-13 EU letter, explanatory notes and proposed CMM on Port State Measures WCPFC-2010-DP-09 FFA members proposed CMM to prohibit purse seine fishing associated with Whale sharks WCPFC-2010-DP-15 (Rev 3) Proposal for the implementation of an EEZ entry and exit notification scheme WCPFC-2010-DP-17 (Rev 1) Proposed CMM mitigating fishing impacts on cetaceans WCPFC-2010-DP-11 Proposal by Tonga to amend paragraph 15 of CMM 2007-03 including the decision reflected in para 265.

AGENDA  ITEM  10  -  REPORT OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE 10.1 Review of the Committee Meeting"
WCPFC7,426,"The Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC), Ambassador Terry Toomata (Samoa) presented the report of FAC4 (WCPFC6-2010-32, (Rev 1)) (Attachment CC).  Highlights of the report included ongoing arrears (the Chair noted recent contributions and thanked members, and SIDS in particular, for their contributions); the draft strategic plan; staff salary increases, linked to CROP staff salary scales; addition of an assistant science manager position; and the proposed budget and work programme for 2011. The FAC Chair noted certain reductions in the proposed 2011 budget, as put forward by the FAC, and the need to agree on a formula for CNMs; the FAC recommended that all CNMs be asked to contribute 50% of the amount that would be due if that CNM was a member."
WCPFC7,427,"A CCM noted that there are outstanding unpaid dues, and encouraged members to address their arrears."
WCPFC7,428,"Canada introduced the draft strategic plan (WCPFC7-2010-FAC4/15 (Rev 15)), noting that a template was under development that could be used by members when nominating CMMs so that their strategic impacts can be better evaluated; FAC-4 recommended adoption of the plan."
WCPFC7,429,"CCMs discussed the calculation of contributions by members. The Finance and Administration Officer clarified that the catch figures in calculating member contributions are based on an average of the most current 3-year catch figures as compiled by SPC. The catch tables are included in the budget tables, and circulated to members 45 days prior to the meeting to allow for review."
WCPFC7,430,"CCMs noted the significant budget increases in the 2012 indicative budget, and the need to contain costs and address cost recovery. Some CCMs noted the high per capita contributions they make to the Commission. Concerns were raised over the increase in the wealth component contribution, and some CCMs suggested the Commission should consider capping this."
WCPFC7,431,"CCMs agreed on the importance of conducting a yellowfin stock assessment in 2011, to inform the Commission’s review of CMM 2008-01, and decided to retain US$70,000 in the 2011 budget for that assessment, with the understanding the funds would be carried over to 2012 should SPC find it was not feasible to conduct the assessment in 2011 as scheduled.  10.2 Budget Approval for 2011"
WCPFC7,432,"WCPFC7 accepted the recommendations of FAC4 as set out in the report of FAC4 (WCPFC6-2010/32, Rev 1), specifically noting that it: i. accepted the audited financial statements for 2009 as set out in paper WCPFC7-2010-FAC4/04, and encouraged all members to pay their contributions on time and in full; ii. adopted salary increases from 1 January 2011 as follows: 3% for Grade I; 4% for Grade J; 10% for Grade K; and 15% for Grades L and M; and noted, in respect of support staff, 60  the statutory increase of 1% in employer social security contributions introduced by the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia and accordingly increased its employer contribution figure by 1%, which will be reflected in its Staff Regulations; established a new Grade J position with the terms of reference at Attachment 3 to FAC-4;  iii. adopted the Commission Budget and Work Programme as contained in the FAC4 report; iv. agreed that all CNMs should pay an annual contribution that is 50% of the assessed contribution amount that would be payable if the CNM was a member, and that the Executive Director will inform CNMs and Members of the level of their recommended and assessed contributions as soon as practicable after each Annual Session and the amounts should be payable within 60 days of receipt of that notification.

WCPFC8,18,"Holly Koehler (USA), Vice Chair of the TCC, presented a report on cooperating non-member applications (WCPFC8-2011/10).  TCC7 reviewed eleven applications for cooperating non-member status for 2012, one of which, St. Kitts and Nevis, was a new applicant and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) was a second time applicant.  All applications were recommended for consideration by WCPFC8 subject to provision of additional information.  DPRK, El Salvador, Ecuador, Senegal, Panama and Belize, provided additional information.  The TCC Vice Chair clarified that Panama and Thailand are not required to submit Annual Reports Parts 1 and 2 for 2010 as they did not becomes CNMs until 2011."
WCPFC8,19,"The following points from the updated application files as of the opening of WCPFC8 were highlighted by the TCC Vice Chair:  a. Belize was asked to provide all available operational logsheet data and to confirm the number of vessels which would be operating in the WCPFC Convention Area if CNM status is renewed.  The information submitted by Belize indicated the number of fishing vessels that would continue to operate in the Convention Area if CNM status is renewed.  This information shows that since a logbook programme was only implemented in 2011, previous  4 operational data are not available.  Belize’s financial contribution for 2011 was paid in full.   b. The DPRK was asked to provide catch data and a breakdown of vessels.  These data were provided.  Regarding DPRK-flagged vessels on the CCAMLR IUU Vessel List, the DPRK information indicates that two vessels have been de-registered and the third vessel’s registration has expired.  The DPRK indicated it would make a financial contribution once it becomes a WCPFC member.   c. Ecuador was asked to confirm that its vessels will operate according to the participatory rights granted; equip vessels with VMS; provide catch data and Annual Reports.  Ecuador confirmed compliance with granted participatory rights and use of VMS and stated that it would apply IATTC management rules in the overlap area.  Some data were provided.  Ecuador’s financial contribution for 2011 was paid in full.   d. El Salvador was asked provide the number of days fished by purse seine vessels, and to confirm compliance with granted participatory rights.  El Salvador provided the effort data (WCPFC8-2011-OP12) and a FAD Management Plan (WCPFC8-2011-OP13), and indicated that it had historically fished the overlap area and reserved its right to do so as a member of IATTC.  El Salvador’s financial contribution for 2011 was paid in full.   e. Indonesia was asked to confirm its commitment to make a financial contribution to the Commission, provide the number of days fished by purse seine vessels, confirm compliance with participatory rights granted and VMS requirements, provide information on IUU-listed vessels, and provide catch and effort data.  No response was received from Indonesia.  No financial contribution was received for 2011.   f. Mexico was asked to confirm its commitment to make a financial contribution to the Commission, provide catch and effort data and its Annual Report – Part 2 for 2010.  No response was received from Mexico.  No Annual Reports were received from Mexico for 2011.  Mexico advised that it is not able to pay a contribution until it becomes a contracting party.   g. Panama was asked to provide information on IUU-listed vessels.  No response was received from Panama.  Panama advised that it was willing to pay its financial contribution but the payment had not yet been received by the Secretariat.   h. St. Kitts and Nevis was asked to confirm that its carriers and bunkers will comply with transhipment and VMS requirements.  No response was received from St Kitts and Nevis on these points, but it indicated a financial contribution can be made upon approval of the Ministry.   i. Senegal was asked to confirm compliance with High Seas Boarding and Inspection (HSBI) requirements and its commitment to provide a financial contribution.  It was noted that no vessels flagged to Senegal have fished in the WCPF Convention Area since 2008.  Senegal confirmed compliance with HSBI but stated that its national regulations do not allow financial contributions to international organizations unless it is a contracting Party.  Annual Reports-Parts 1 and 2 have not been received.  No financial contribution has been received.   j. Thailand was asked to confirm compliance with HSBI requirements.  Thailand confirmed it would comply.  Thailand’s 2011 financial contribution was paid in full.    5 k. Vietnam was asked to provide Annual Reports-Parts 1 and 2 for 2010.  No response was received from Vietnam.  Vietnam’s 2011 financial contribution was paid in full."
WCPFC8,20,"FFA members, while recognizing that CNM applicants represent legitimate development partners, stressed the importance of CNM applicants providing all requested information to TCC and paying their share of the costs of the Commission as assessed."
WCPFC8,21,Other CCMs also urged CNM applicants to provide requested information and to make financial contributions.
WCPFC8,22,One CNM pointed out that there appears to be no difference in the treatment of CNM applications from those CNM applicants which have paid their assessed financial contribution and those which have not.
WCPFC8,23,"Some CCM highlighted the ongoing issues involving the overlap area. These CCMs suggested that until these issues are resolved, CNMs should fish in accordance with the participatory rights granted to them by WCPFC.   Other CCMs reminded that CNMs who are also members of IATTC have historical fishing rights in the overlap area and comply with IATTC provisions that include total closure for tropical tuna purse seine fishery. Those CCMs considered it urgent to agree a joint approach with IATTC for managing the overlap area as suggested by the Chair's report of the Joint IATTC-WCPFC Workshop that took place on July 11, 2011 in La Jolla, California, USA in the margin of Kobe ΠΙ meeting."

WCPFC8,26,Some CCMs supported the CNM application of Indonesia.
WCPFC8,27,"Some CCMs indicated that while Indonesia continues to report progress on ratification, and the Commission has shown patience in this regard, demonstrable results should to be presented to WCPFC9."
WCPFC8,28,"Indonesia noted that, similar to its position in other t-RFMOs, it will not be able to make a financial contribution until it becomes a full member.  Indonesia stated that progress toward ratification is being made and a Presidential decree is expected soon.  In reply to a query about the status of Indonesia-flagged vessels on RFMO IUU Vessel Lists, Indonesia explained that all administrative sanctions have been complied with and remaining issues are being discussed with IATTC."
WCPFC8,29,The Chairman of the Northern Committee noted that Mexico has not responded to requests to participate in the work of the Northern Committee and requested the WCPFC Chair to write to Mexico to emphasize the importance of this issue.
WCPFC8,30,Mexico committed to participating in the Northern Committee starting at NC8.     6
WCPFC8,31,One CCM requested that Panama provide information on all of their t-RFMO IUU-listed vessels for the consideration of TCC8 when evaluating CNM applications for 2013.
WCPFC8,32,"Panama explained that it had made several attempts to pay its financial contribution and would continue to attempt to effect payment.  Panama referred CCMs to papers they submitted as WCPFC8-2011-DP/43, WCPFC8-2011-DP/44 and WCPFC8-2011-OP/14, which provide more information regarding Panama-flagged vessels on IUU lists and Panamas Annual Report Part 1."
WCPFC8,33,Papua New Guinea expressed concerns regarding the building of new purse seine fishing vessels by Vietnam.
WCPFC8,34,Vietnam requested more information from Papua New Guinea about these concerns and questioned whether this type of issue is pertinent to a decision on CNM status.
WCPFC8,35,"The WCPFC Legal Advisor, Dr Martin Tsamenyi, provided a summary of the procedures for considering CNM application.  As specified in CMM 2009-01, the process has four stages.  First, the applicant must provide the required data.  Second, TCC undertakes an evaluation of the application, identifies any gaps that applicants are required to fill and informs the applicant of these gaps.  Third, TCC makes a recommendation on each CNM’s application to the Commission, and fourth, the Commission considers the TCC’s recommendations, including any remaining areas of insufficiency in the applications, and decides whether to grant CNM status.  Regarding the fourth step, CMM 2009-01 is clear with respect to the need for the Commission to consider whether the technical information provided is adequate.  If the information is considered adequate then CNM status will be granted and subsequent to that decision the Commission will determine the participatory rights for each applicant.  The Commission was reminded that the determination of the sufficiency of the information provided to support the application is separate from the determination of participatory rights."
WCPFC8,36,"WCPFC8 agreed to grant CNM status for 2012 to Belize, the DPRK, Ecuador, El Salvador, Indonesia, Mexico, Panama, St. Kitts and Nevis, Senegal, Thailand and Vietnam."
WCPFC8,37,WCPFC8 also agreed that the WCPFC Chair will write to Mexico to reinforce the importance of their participation in the work of the Northern Committee.
WCPFC8,38," A small working group, led by Kiribati, was convened to consider the issue of participatory rights for CNMs.  The small working group developed draft report language for participatory rights for CNMs including for the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area (WCPFC8-2011-48 Rev2).  These recommendations were accepted by WCPFC8."
WCPFC8,39,"WCPFC8 agreed that in accordance with provisions of the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following limits apply to the participatory rights of Cooperating non-members (CNMs) for fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area."
WCPFC8,40,"WCPFC8 also agreed that, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under their national jurisdiction or other CCM’s national jurisdiction, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements. Such CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPF Convention and WCPFC conservation and management measures. In addition, such CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV). CCMs shall ensure that  7 CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention. Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will be conditional on full compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention. CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the TCC."
WCPFC8,41,WCPFC8 noted that the CNMs identified below (paragraphs 43-53) provide assurances that they will comply with all requests from Commission Members for information and documentation to investigate cases of possible illegal fishing.
WCPFC8,42,"WCPFC8 encouraged CNMs to implement export controls that ensure that their shipbuilding activities do not undermine any conservation and management measures adopted by the Commission to control fishing capacity in the WCPO tuna fisheries, in accordance with Article 10, or undermine Article 30 of the Convention.  Belize"
WCPFC8,43,"WCPFC8 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Belize with the following participatory rights:  Catches of bigeye tuna from Belize are limited to 803.25 mt and 2,000 mt of yellowfin tuna.

WCPFC8,57,"In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, flag states of fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC, shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area."
WCPFC8,58,"For investigation of possible IUU fishing activities consistent to international and domestic laws, flag states of fishing vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area."
WCPFC8,59,Discussion continued on the IATTC and WCPFC Overlap Area under Agenda 11.1.1 (see paragraphs 430 – 440).   AGENDA  ITEM  3  -  MEMBER STATEMENTS 3.1 Annual Reports by the CCMs
WCPFC8,60,"Aliki Faipule Kerisiano Kalolo, the Ulu O of Tokelau, delivered a statement to WCPFC8 (WCPFC8-2011-DP/46), Attachment E.   3.2 Statements of Non-Members"
WCPFC8,61,There were no statements provided by cooperating non-members.
WCPFC8,62,Statements were provided by WWF South Pacific Albacore Policy Brief (Attachment F) and Greenpeace Position on Rights Based Management (Attachment G). 3.3 Special Requirements of Developing States 3.3.1 CCM Reports on the Implementation of Article 30 of the Convention
WCPFC8,63,The Chair introduced this agenda item explaining that it originates in Article 30 of the WCPF Convention.  The Chair suggested that a common understanding of the intent of Article 30 would be necessary for the Commission to make progress on achieving that intent.
WCPFC8,64," Some CCMS, including FFA members, expressed a desire to see a more genuine commitment to the development of SIDS fishing and fish processing capabilities, and to receive assistance that responds to the needs articulated by SIDS.  FFA members noted that they would be seeking greater integration of these issues through key agenda items in WCPFC8 rather than through  a single agenda item."
WCPFC8,65,Wallis and Futuna informed WCPFC8 that a small longliner has recently begun operations in their waters and they looked forward to further development of their fishery.
WCPFC8,66,"Japan noted that it has made substantial contributions to SIDS in the form of economic, health and infrastructure projects with a total contribution of 35 million USD over five years.  Other contributions have focused on training programmes, improvement of fishing technology, and assistance with travel costs provided through FFA.    11"
WCPFC8,67,The United States submitted a written statement (WCPFC8-2011-DP53- Attachment H) and confirmed it was prepared to listen at WCPFC8 and other forums to the aspirations of SIDS.
WCPFC8,68,"The EU submitted a written statement (WCPFC8-2011 DP50, and appended as Attachment I) and indicated that it wished to strengthen its cooperation with SIDS by consulting with them to continue addressing their needs."
WCPFC8,69,"Chinese Taipei described several training, fisheries development, vessel construction and technology transfer projects which it believes have developed skills, capacity and economic benefits for SIDS."
WCPFC8,70,"Korea stated that it recently hosted a capacity building workshop on port state measures and catch documentation schemes, and is planning to host another workshop on data improvement, ecosystems and bycatch with all travel costs paid."
WCPFC8,71,"The Philippines noted its partnership with SIDS in fisheries development, in particular noting its construction of two canneries, with an additional two planned, creating a substantial number of new jobs and export revenue."
WCPFC8,72,"Some CCMs suggested that reiterating descriptions of ongoing assistance projects is not a useful exercise.  Nauru on behalf of FFA members, recommended that the most robust way of recognising the special requirements of SIDS would be to make explicit allowance concerning these special requirements as an integral part of each CMM."
WCPFC8,73,The Chair noted that this dialogue had produced some clear statements regarding the type of assistance required and the willingness of development partners to assist.  The WCPFC Chair also stated that the discussion demonstrated the need to integrate the intent of Article 30 of the Convention into considerations of the Commission’s CMMs.   AGENDA  ITEM  4  -  COMMISSION REVIEW 4.1 Review of the WCPFC
WCPFC8,74,"The Chair of the WCPFC Performance Review Panel (PRP), Dr Fábio Hazin, presented the report of the panel (WCPFC8-2011/12).  The work of the panel was initiated in 2011 and involved four external experts (Dr Denzil Miller, Dr Fábio Hazin, Mr Ichiro Nomura and Dr Judith Swan) and three internal experts (Mr John Spencer (EU), the Hon. Min. Roland Kun (Nauru), and Mr Malcolm Sarmiento (Philippines)).  The report contains 79 recommendations which were presented for discussion by CCMs."
WCPFC8,75,All CCMs which voiced an opinion remarked on the usefulness of the review and on the valuable and comprehensive advice provided.  They thanked the PRP members for their tremendous efforts.
WCPFC8,76,"Several CCMs, including FFA members, requested that more time be provided for review and comment on the document."
WCPFC8,77,Some CCMs expressed regret at not being able to provide input to the PRP noting that they did not receive any request for input and therefore were unaware of the opportunity.     12
WCPFC8,78,Some CCMs stated that it would not be appropriate for CCMs to comment on the recommendations of the PRP as it is an independent body and noted that the document is a final report.
WCPFC8,79,The Executive Director clarified that the work of the PRP is now complete and that any further involvement will have contractual implications.
WCPFC8,80,"Some CCMs stated that the report as it now stands provides a useful reference, and suggested that the Commission immediately begin to implement as appropriate specific points in the report as various issues come before the Commission for discussion."
WCPFC8,81,"  Some CCMs and observers advocated a more systematic approach to responding to the recommendations of the PRP, e.g. preparing an implementation plan or framework, creating a standing agenda item for Commission meetings, or categorizing the recommendations and distributing them to the Commission’s subsidiary bodies for prioritization and action as appropriate.  The EU drew attention to its previous written communication to CCMs on a possible approach for follow-up to the review. It proposed that the WCPFC Secretariat prepare a table with three columns: one column with the panel recommendations, one column with the WCPFC body best placed to follow-up on this recommendation, and one column with the proposed way forward."
WCPFC8,82,"WCPFC8 noted the report of the Performance Review Panel.  WCPFC8 agreed that CCMs could provide comments to the Secretariat by June 1 2012 on the priorities and process to move the recommendations forward.  WCPFC8 tasked the Executive Director with preparing a matrix categorising the recommendations, and noting any comments from CCMs, for the consideration of the Commission’s subsidiary bodies as appropriate.  The matrix and recommendations from subsidiary bodies will be considered at WCPFC9.   AGENDA  ITEM  5  -  COST RECOVERY REVIEW 5.1 Cost Optimisation of Commission Operations"
WCPFC8,83,"Mr Nick Wyatt presented a report entitled “Cost Recovery and Optimization of Commission Services Costs” (WCPFC8-2011/13 (Rev 1)).  The objectives of the study were to identify costs that would be appropriate and practical to recover, and to explore cost recovery as a means of optimising the costs of Commission services.  The Commission services assessed in the report included the VMS, the ROP, the RFV, CNMs, observers at meetings, and carriers and bunkers.  Scientific services were not assessed.  The study considered that the key way for cost optimisation to occur is when those who face the costs are able to influence those costs by changing their behaviour."
WCPFC8,84,"Regarding VMS, it was considered that the Service Level Agreement (SLA) does not provide incentives for cost optimisation and the study recommended that users should meet mobile communication costs and activation charges."
WCPFC8,85,"Since the cost of the ROP is mainly driven by data entry costs, the study recommended that direct cost of data entry should be paid by vessels, based on an average cost per vessel regardless of whether they carry an observer.     13"
WCPFC8,86,"The RFV was considered to be not particularly useful, and the study recommended that it should be converted to a central vessel register of the vessels that fish.  Listing should be charged on a per vessel basis to encourage only those vessels which fish to be registered."
WCPFC8,87,"In general, it was considered that CNMs should face same charges as full members.  However, as CNMs receive the same benefits but no voting rights, a discount of 50% was considered appropriate."
WCPFC8,88,"The study noted that the cost of the WCPFC is quite low compared to other Commissions, and that the costs of the Secretariat itself should not be recovered as this would create poor incentives."
WCPFC8,89,CCMs uniformly expressed concerns about the rising costs of the Commission and welcomed the opportunity to explore how to optimise and contain those costs.
WCPFC8,90,"FFA members noted that SIDS, especially those with few vessels are at present disproportionately carrying the burden for vessel-based costs.  These members also noted the high costs associated with attending meetings and referred to their proposal for the rationalisation of the Commission’s meeting schedule (WCPFC8-2011-DP/48, discussed under Agenda Item 14)."
WCPFC8,91,"Some CCMs opposed the idea of distributing costs to vessels, pointing out that the current model allocates costs to CCMs based on catch history representing vessel activities and a wealth component."
WCPFC8,92,The EU stated that this study should have looked as a priority at cost optimisation and only afterwards at cost recovery.
WCPFC8,93,"Some CCMs questioned why the study focused more on cost recovery than on cost optimisation.  Australia noted that there are two distinct avenues to this work: cost optimisation and cost recovery, and that both avenues can (and should) run simultaneously."
WCPFC8,94,"Several CCMs noted that the Commission’s VMS and ROP have major implications for costs and thus should be examined in greater technical detail to find opportunities for cost savings.  Specific points mentioned included several options for ROP data entry and transfer protocols, and removing duplication within regional VMSs."
WCPFC8,95,A number of CCMs suggested that the Secretariat be tasked with progressing the issues of cost optimization intersessionally particularly around issues relating to VMS and ROP.  It was recommended that these further technical points be revisited under agenda items pertaining to the ROP and VMS.   AGENDA  ITEM  6  -  SCIENCE ISSUES 6.1 Report of the Seventh Regular Session of the Scientific Committee
WCPFC8,96,"Dr Naozumi Miyabe, Chair of the Scientific Committee, presented the report of SC7 (WCPFC8-2011/14).       14 6.1.1 Stock Status of Key Tuna Species"
WCPFC8,97,"Dr John Hampton of SPC, the Scientific Services Provider to the Commission, presented a summary of the status of the stocks (WCPFC8-2011-IP/02) based on the full report presented to SC7 in WCPFC8-2011/14."
WCPFC8,98,Total catches for 2011 appear to have remained stable compared to 2010 at a level of ~2.4 million t.
WCPFC8,99,"The total purse seine fishery catch in 2010 was 1.7 million t which represents a reduction from the peak catch in 2009.  It is expected that 2011 purse seine catches, once fully compiled, will be slightly lower, although effort in 2011 was at a record high.  This is because purse seine catch quantity varies with set type.  Unassociated sets comprised a record high of ~75% of the total in 2010, whereas 2011 was a more typical year with a more even balance in unassociated and associated (both FAD and log) sets (i.e. 60% and 40%, respectively).  During the three FAD closures in 2009, 2010 and 2011, the effort (in days) in the purse seine fishery continued at near-normal levels.  .  In 2009 and 2010, catch rates were somewhat reduced during the FAD closure, but rebounded immediately after the FAD closure ended.  In 2011 there was poor performance in the fishery during the closure itself, and based on limited data available to date, catch rates again seem to have increased during the fourth quarter.  These features of the 2011 fishery may have been due to La Niña effects which had concentrated the purse seine fishery in the western portion of the WCPF Convention Area by the fourth quarter of 2010."
WCPFC8,100,"In the longline fishery, the proportion of the catch consisting of bigeye tuna has diminished in recent years while the proportion of albacore catch has increased substantially.  An estimation of longline effort based on VMS data suggests that effort is and increasing in both the tropical and southern fishing grounds."
WCPFC8,101,"The catch of skipjack tuna fell slightly in 2010 and is expected to decline further in 2011 most likely due to poor fishing conditions in the middle part of the year.  The total catch of 1.6 million t in 2010 was dominated by purse seine catches while the proportion of catch from the pole and line fishery continued to decrease.  Currently skipjack stocks are estimated to be depleted to 55% of their unexploited biomass and if current catches continue stock depletion will reach 25% of unexploited biomass.  Skipjack stocks are not considered overfished, nor is overfishing occurring."
WCPFC8,102,"Catches of yellowfin tuna have recently stabilized after a prolonged trend of increase.  Current exploitation levels (~500,000 t per year) are approaching the limit of the stock’s exploitation potential.  Currently, yellowfin stocks are estimated to be depleted to 40% of their unexploited biomass, but in the western equatorial zone, where 90% of the catch occurs, estimates of depletion to 30% unexploited biomass are of concern.  Yellowfin stocks are not considered overfished, nor is overfishing occurring."
WCPFC8,103,"For bigeye tuna, most catches were adult fish caught by the longline fishery.  The catch in 2010 was the lowest since 1996 and the level of depletion in the stock (to~20% of unexploited levels) i.e. SBcurrent/SBcurrent F=o =0.23, is the highest of any tuna stock in WCPF Convention Area.  Overfishing is occurring in bigeye tuna stocks (F>FMSY); the bigeye stock biomass is approaching the MSY biomass and there is a possibility that bigeye tuna is already in an overfished state.     15"
WCPFC8,104,"South Pacific albacore tuna is mainly caught by the longline fishery and this catch is primarily composed of adult fish.  Catches have doubled since 1995 with a 30% increase in 2010 catches compared to 2009.  Continuing a trend of steady decline since the mid 1960s, South Pacific albacore stocks are estimated to be depleted to 60% of their unexploited biomass.  Catches in 2010 of 81,000 t are the highest on record and current catch rates are approaching MSY levels.  Albacore stocks are not considered overfished, nor is overfishing occurring."
WCPFC8,105,FFA members expressed appreciation for the work of the SPC and their interest in seeing the results of the next South Pacific albacore assessment.
WCPFC8,106,"The EU noted the level of purse seiner efforts demonstrates that CMM 2008-01 had not  been effective. On claims that the FADs closure had been largely respected, it queried the basis for such conclusions, especially in a context where many observer reports are still not available and considering that observer coverage on purse seiners in some EEZs has been only around 50 %, as evident from Part 1 national reports and the 3rd Annual Report for the Regional Observer Programme WCPFC8-2011-24. This is all the more important considering that 95 % of the purse seine fishing activities take place in waters of coastal states.The EU questioned whether the recent observed shifts in purse seine set type patterns from associated sets to unassociated sets are due to La Niña effects.  It also requested that annual catch data be provided by area for EEZs, archipelagic waters and the high seas and that this data will be systematically provided in the future.  The EU suggested that as 2010 was an anomalous year it should not be used as a baseline.  Further clarification was requested regarding whether the reference to longline effort increase was based on a change in the number of hooks fished."
WCPFC8,107,Japan posed similar questions regarding the unique characteristics of the 2010 fishing year and the distribution of catch in the EEZs versus the eastern and western high seas areas.
WCPFC8,108,"Dr Hampton confirmed that sets on logs, and other associated set types, were low in 2010, but there is insufficient evidence to establish a link between this and La Niña conditions.  He noted that 2011 set type data showed a more typical pattern, but that low catches of log-associated fish have continued.  The use of 2010 fishery conditions in the projections was simply because it was the most recent data available and provides one example of the reductions in current fishing effort that may be required to achieve MSY conditions for bigeye tuna.  He referred CCMs to other documentation provided to the Commission containing the requested catch data (see WCPFC8-2011-IP/10 (Rev 1)).  Regarding longline effort, Dr Hampton explained that the analysis was based on VMS data which is expected to be approximately proportional to effort in hooks; however actual figures for effort in hooks must await compilation of logsheet data."
WCPFC8,109,FFA noted that the figure used for some CCMs to suggest that the FAD closure did not work in 2011 could not be relied upon as it only contains data through to June 2011- before the commencement of the FAD closure. 6.1.2 Science Committee Recommendations and Management Advice
WCPFC8,110,"The SC Chair presented the stock management recommendations from SC7 (WCPFC8-2011/14):   a. Bigeye Tuna:  Overfishing is occurring and there is a possibility that the stock is in an overfished state.  A minimum reduction of 32% in current F would be required to achieve FMSY.    16 b. Yellowfin Tuna:  Overfishing is not occurring and the stock is not overfished (although one modelling simulation indicated overfishing).  It was noted that there should be no increase in F in the western equatorial region since it accounts for ~81% of the total yellowfin catch, spawning biomass derives from this region, and the stock is estimated to have declined to about 31% of its unexploited level.   c. Skipjack Tuna:  Although F has been higher in the last decade, the stock is not overfished and the moderate level of exploitation represented by the current F is considered sustainable.   d. South Pacific Albacore:  The stock is not overfished nor is overfishing occurring.  The current stock biomass can sustain the current catch but any increase in F is likely to result in catch rate declines especially for longline catches of adult fish. e. South Pacific Swordfish:  As there is no new stock assessment, the management advice from SC5 is maintained.   f. South West Pacific Striped Marlin:  As there is no new stock assessment, the management advice from SC2 is maintained.   g. North Pacific Striped Marlin.  As there is no new stock assessment, the management advice from SC6 is maintained and SC7 acknowledged the need to for an immediate reduction in F for this species.   h. North Pacific Albacore.  As there is neither overfishing nor is the stock in an overfished state, this stock is considered to be healthy and its sustainability is not threatened.   i. Pacific Bluefin Tuna:  As there is no new stock assessment, the management advice from SC6 is maintained.  (Efforts toward reducing F for this species are discussed under Agenda Item 7).   j. North Pacific Swordfish:  No new stock assessment was conducted.  As SC6 concluded that North Pacific swordfish stocks are healthy, no management advice was provided."
WCPFC8,111,"FFA members articulated their support for the scientific recommendations of SC7 and noted they would be raising specific concerns for some of the stocks under other agenda items.  In particular, FFA members urged that fishing mortality for bigeye tuna be reduced across a range of gear types and that updated projections be used in deliberations on CMM 2008-01.   6.1.3 SC Management Issues Theme"
WCPFC8,112,"Other management issues arising from discussions at SC7, including terms of reference for the “Management Issues Theme” of SC, Limit Reference Points, and the Management Objectives Workshop, were presented by Dr Miyabe (WCPFC8-2011/39).    Terms of Reference for “Management Issues Theme” of SC"
WCPFC8,113,"The SC Chair explained that the Management Issues Theme was held at SC6 and SC7.  At SC7 a Terms of Reference for the theme was discussed and recommended for WCPFC8 adoption (WCPFC8-2011-14, Attachment G)."
WCPFC8,114,FFA members supported the Terms of References for the Management Issues Theme.
WCPFC8,115,Japan stated that it was inappropriate for the Scientific Committee to consider economic and social issues and asked for revisions to the Terms of Reference.     17
WCPFC8,116,The USA noted that inclusion of economic and social factors was included in the Terms of Reference for the theme based on the recommendations of the Independent Review of the Commission’s Transitional Science Structure and Functions.
WCPFC8,117,Japan submitted amendments to the Management Issues Theme Terms of Reference (WCPFC8-2011-DP/47).
WCPFC8,118,WCPFC8 adopted the revised Terms of Reference for the Management Issues Theme of the Scientific Committee as contained in WCPFC8-2011-DP/47.  This is appended as Attachment J.    Limit Reference Points
WCPFC8,119,"Dr Miyabe explained that SC7 considered a hierarchical structure for, and definitions of, limit reference points (LRPs)."
WCPFC8,120,"FFA members noted the importance of defining reference points and expressed support for the hierarchical approach.  However, these CCMs considered that more work needs to be done to refine the definitions prior to SC8.  FFA members stated that they are working toward defining reference points for stocks in their EEZs.  They considered that reference points can be set to incorporate social and economic concerns, for example, it may be appropriate to set reference points above MSY in order to maintain stocks at levels which are economically viable as well as biologically sustainable."
WCPFC8,121,"The EU stated that reference points should be set only for biological considerations. Socio-economic aspects can be considered when developing management objectives, inter alia in the framework of the Management Objectives Workshop (MOW)."
WCPFC8,122,The WCPFC Chair observed that there are some stocks lying outside of FFA members’ EEZs which also require reference points to be defined.
WCPFC8,123,"Some CCMs expressed the opinion that LRPs should focus on biology; in contrast, managers can set target reference points (TRPs) based on considerations of social and economic factors."
WCPFC8,124,"Dr SungKwon Soh explained that since the Management Objective Workshop had been postponed, the Scientific Services Provider was using funds previously allocated for reference point research in 2011 to continue to progress this work prior to SC8.  Results presented and discussed at SC8 would then be discussed at the Management Objectives Workshop before being presented to the Commission."
WCPFC8,125,"WCPFC8 endorsed the hierarchical approach to identifying limit reference points, tasked the Scientific Services Provider with preparing proposed limit reference points for the consideration of SC8, and directed SC8 to take account of WCPFC8’s concerns regarding reference points in its further deliberations.    Management Objectives Workshop (TORs, Schedule, Venue)"
WCPFC8,126,"Dr Miyabe presented a draft terms of reference for the Management Objectives Workshop (MOW) and requested direction from WCPFC8 regarding a date, a venue, a convenor and suitable independent international experts (WCPFC8-2011/39).     18"
WCPFC8,127,"The Executive Director added that the purpose of the MOW is to introduce the terms and framework for harvest control rules, of which LRPs and TRPs are a part, and then to begin to work toward the development of management objectives.  He stated that CCMs will be requested to provide nominations for a convenor and expert participants."
WCPFC8,128,"Japan expressed concern that the draft TOR of the MOW proposed by the Secretariat was substantially expanded in scope from the one prepared by SC7. In particular, it pointed out that the harvest control rule, which was implemented in the case of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) whose stock was in a critical condition, might not be appropriate for the species covered by the WCPFC, which are in much better position than SBT."
WCPFC8,129,"Canada expressed its strong support for the MOW and drew WCPFC8’s attention to its proposal for a pilot project on bigeye tuna involving applying the Kobe II strategy matrix as a harmonized format for conveying scientific advice (WCPFC8-2011/39, Attachment 1)."
WCPFC8,130,"While generally supportive of holding the MOW, CCMs requested more discussion of the terms of reference and MOW scheduling."
WCPFC8,131,Palau led a SWG to further develop and refine the MOW terms of reference and the logistics for holding the workshop.
WCPFC8,132,WCPFC8 adopted the terms of reference for the management objectives workshop as produced by the SWG in WCPFC8-2011/39 (Rev 2) (Attachment K).  WCPFC8 considered that the optimal dates for the workshop would be just prior to WCPFC9 (29-30 November 2012) and that the workshop should be led by a professional facilitator.   6.1.4 Ecosystem and Bycatch Issues Shark Key Species
WCPFC8,133,Dr Miyabe noted that SC7 had recommended to WCPFC8 a process for designating WCPFC key shark species for data provision and assessment (WCPFC8-2011-IP/05).
WCPFC8,134,WPCFC8 adopted the process for designating WCPFC key shark species.  (Attachment L)
WCPFC8,135,Dr Miyabe also noted that SC7 recommended that WCPFC8 consider mitigation measures for oceanic white tip and blue sharks in the North Pacific.  These issues were considered through discussion of a proposal for a new CMM on sharks (Agenda Item 9.2.6).    Seabirds
WCPFC8,136,"Dr Miyabe explained that based on discussion of seabird issues at SC7 no new management recommendations were formulated, thus the management recommendations from SC6 are still current.      Whales Sharks and Cetaceans"
WCPFC8,137,"Dr Miyabe introduced discussions at SC7 regarding best practice guidelines for the release of whale sharks and cetaceans without injury, noting that these issues would be considered through discussion of two proposals for new CMMs under Agenda Item 9.2.2.     19"
WCPFC8,138,PNA members reminded WCPFC8 that setting on whale sharks is prohibited under the PNA’s Third Implementing Arrangement.  The arrangement reads: “ No purse seine vessel shall engage in fishing or related activity in order to catch tuna associated with whale sharks”
WCPFC8,139,One CCM suggested that a stock assessment be conducted for whale sharks.
WCPFC8,140,"Other CCMs noted that decisions to conduct stock assessments should be taken following the process for designating WCPFC key shark species which can then be prioritized for stock assessment.  Therefore, further consideration of an assessment for whale sharks should be taken up by the Scientific Committee.    Food security issues with bycatch"
WCPFC8,141,Dr Miyabe noted that SC7 recommended that issues associated with the volumes of food fish discarded in regional tuna fisheries and the impact of tuna fishing on key food stocks be incorporated into the research plan of the SC.
WCPFC8,142,WCPFC8 agreed that consideration of research on the volume of food fish discard and the impact of tuna fishing on key food species should be undertaken by the SC.   6.1.5 Data Issues
WCPFC8,143,"Dr Miyabe raised issues arising from SC7 including data gaps, regional observer programme data, the West Pacific East Asia Oceanic Fisheries Management (WPEA-OFM) Project, and research on species composition in purse seine sets.    Data Gaps"
WCPFC8,144,Dr Miyabe reflected discussions at SC7 regarding the importance of accurate and timely data for effective management.  These issues relate to adherence to the requirements of “Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission” as well as appropriate exchange of data with other bodies such as ISC.
WCPFC8,145,"FFA members encouraged CCMs to comply with the Commission’s data provision rules, and reminded CCMs of their obligation for those who are not to submit data improvement plans explaining what their national legal impediment is and how to resolve it."
WCPFC8,146,The EU stated that its data submissions for Pacific swordfish are now complete and the EU has now submitted all necessary data.   The EU supported port sampling as a means of improving scientific understanding of the fishery.
WCPFC8,147,WCPFC8 noted the recommendations of SC7 regarding data gaps.    Regional Observer Program
WCPFC8,148,Dr Miyabe informed WCPFC8 that SC7 recommended that the ongoing audits of ROP programmes continue.
WCPFC8,149,The EU asked that audit reports of the Regional Observer program be made available to all CCMs.
WCPFC8,150,WCPFC8 accepted the recommendation of SC7 that ROP audits continue.      20 WPEA-OFM Project
WCPFC8,151,Dr Miyabe informed WCPFC8 that SC7 noted the progress with the WPEA-OFM Project and supported the continuation this work.
WCPFC8,152,WCPFC8 accepted the recommendation of SC7 that work on the WPEA OFMP continue.    Species composition in purse seine nets
WCPFC8,153,"Dr Miyabe introduced WCPFC8-2011-IP/06 containing a plan for improvement of the availability and use of purse seine catch composition data.  He informed WCPFC8 that SC7 recommended a no-cost extension of Project 60 through 2012, and proposed that the financial status of this project be reviewed at SC8."
WCPFC8,154,WCPFC8 accepted the recommendation of SC7 for a no-cost extension of Project 60 through 2012.   6.1.6 Review of MOU between WCPFC and ISC
WCPFC8,155,"The Executive Director introduced a proposed revision to the MOU between WCPFC and ISC following direction from WCPFC7 to review the agreement and provide for WCPFC involvement in the north Pacific striped marlin assessment (WCPFC8-2011/38).  He noted that the desired revisions were not explicitly stated, and that the Secretariat considered that an amendment to Annex 3 – Annual Collaborative Work might be more appropriate than amending the main body of the MOU."
WCPFC8,156,Further discussion of this matter was referred to Agenda Item 11.1.   6.2 Programme of Work for the Scientific Committee in 2012-2014
WCPFC8,157,"Dr Miyabe informed WCPFC8 that SC7 had recommended that SPC provide four stock assessments (south Pacific albacore, south western Pacific striped marlin, oceanic white tip shark and silky shark) for the consideration of SC8.  In addition, indicator or reference case analyses are planned for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna and south Pacific swordfish."
WCPFC8,158,"FFA members expressed support for the four proposed stock assessments and for the indicator analyses, but noted that the further work on oceanic white tip sharks should not prevent adoption of a mitigation measure to reduce fishing mortality for this species at WCPFC8."
WCPFC8,159,Some CCM suggested that the results of the oceanic white tip shark stock assessment would need to be received before any decision could be made on mitigation measures for that species.
WCPFC8,160,The EU requested that work proceed on the south Pacific swordfish assessment now that the EU’s swordfish data submission is complete.
WCPFC8,161,"FFA members encouraged capacity building opportunities to be integrated into the budget for SC activities rather than limiting these opportunities to the Special Requirements Fund, the Japan Trust Fund and other such mechanisms."
WCPFC8,162,Some CCMs queried the potential need to re-prioritize the assessment work pending discussions on revisions to CMM 2008-01 at WCPFC8.    21
WCPFC8,163,"One CCM queried the need for a $30,000 allocation for harvest control rules and highlighted the need to agree on the TOR for the Management Objectives Workshop.  This CCM queried unobligated costs and various budget line items, and suggested that cost optimisation considerations should be applied to the SC work plan and budget in order to curb rising costs."
WCPFC8,164,"Further discussions on the SC work plan’s budget were deferred to, and resolved by, the FAC.   6.3 KOBE3 Workshop Recommendations on Science and Bycatch"
WCPFC8,165,Dr Miyabe noted a report on the science recommendations and outcomes of the Joint Technical Bycatch Working Group held at the Kobe III meetings in July 2011 (WCPFC8-2011/15) and invited WCPFC8 to comment.
WCPFC8,166,"FFA members confirmed their support for the Joint Technical Bycatch Working Group as an electronic working group.  However, they expressed concerns about the time and resources devoted to large plenary meeting associated with the Kobe process."
WCPFC8,167,Korea reminded WCPFC of its plan to hold a workshop on ecosystem and bycatch issues (see Agenda Item 3.3.1).
WCPFC8,168,"Canada articulated their commitment to advancing the Kobe recommendations.  While recognising the need for case-by-case considerations, Canada believes the Kobe process provides an opportunity to develop comparable measures among the t-RFMOs."
WCPFC8,169,WCPFC8 accepted the SC7 Report.  AGENDA  ITEM  7  -  NORTHERN COMMITTEE 7.1 Report of the Seventh Regular Session of the Northern Committee 7.1.1 Northern Committee Science Recommendations and Management Advice
WCPFC8,170,"Masanori Miyahara (Japan), Chairman of the Northern Committee, presented the report of the Northern Committee (WCPFC8-2011/16).  The two major themes of the meeting were a review of the implementation of existing measures, and making recommendations on the implementation of the observer programme for vessels fishing for fresh fish in the area north of 20 degrees north."
WCPFC8,171,"Regarding the implementation of existing measures, CMM 2010-04 for Pacific Bluefin tuna requires members, to ensure that the total fishing effort by their vessels shall stay below the 2002-04 level for 2011 and 2012 except for artisanal fisheries. Such measures shall include those to reduce juvenile mortality to 2002-2004 levels except for Korea.  Japan has implemented a purse seine catch limit for juveniles, a voluntary purse seine catch limit for adults, limits on set net licenses, and registration and reporting requirements for artisanal vessels and aquaculture sites.  Korea is implementing a prohibition on juvenile catch with several exemptions but is required to maintain total fishing effort at 2002-2004 levels.  Chinese Taipei has implemented a limit on the number of longline vessels and stated that its fisheries do not catch juveniles.     22"
WCPFC8,172,"With regard to the CMM for North Pacific albacore (CMM 2005-05), the Chair of the NC noted that the NC is progressing toward a revised management framework for this species based on the precautionary approach (see WCPFC8-2011/16, Attachment C)."
WCPFC8,173,"The Chair of the NC noted that the NC6’s proposal to WCPFC7 regarding observers for fresh fish vessels was not accepted, and a new proposal is from NC7 is provided to WCPFC8 as WCPFC8-2011/32.  This proposal implements the ROP for vessels fishing for fresh fish in the area north of 20 degrees north with a coverage of 5% to be achieved by the end of December 2014."
WCPFC8,174,The Chair of the NC stated that VMS issues for northern fisheries will be discussed at NC8.
WCPFC8,175,The USA drew WCPFC8’s attention to WCPFC8-2011-DP/12 on consolidation of proposed observer coverage levels based on CMM 2008-01 and the proposal from the NC (WCPFC8-2011/32).  The paper presents a proposal for a new CMM which would replace CMM 2007-01.
WCPFC8,176,Chinese Taipei expressed support for the proposal made by the Northern Committee and also supported  USA proposal for consolidation of observer requirements.
WCPFC8,177,Further discussion of the issue of observers for the northern fresh fish vessels was deferred to Agenda Item 9.2.3.
WCPFC8,178,FFA members expressed appreciation for the opportunity to participate in the NC.  These CCMs noted that the North Pacific striped marlin assessment was not completed as planned and looked forward to assessment results being provided next year.  The need for stronger measures for Pacific Bluefin tuna was highlighted and clarification on the timeframe of Korea’s exemptions for management of juvenile mortality was requested.
WCPFC8,179,Korea explained that it is not implementing the measures because it does not have any fisheries targeting Pacific Bluefin tuna.  A research project has been launched and once sufficient information is gathered Korea would like to participate in international management measures for this species.
WCPFC8,180,Mexico questioned the need and timeframe for the exemptions for the Japanese artisanal fleet and the Korean fleets.
WCPFC8,181,"The Chair of the NC explained that Japan’s artisanal fleet is comprised of a large number of small vessels with one or two fishermen on board.  The total catch of this sector has been stable for the past three to four decades.  With reference to Korean fleets, the exemption was requested to give Korea more time to understand how their fishery interacts with this species.  The Chair of the NC noted that Mexico has been asked to implement the CMM but no response has been received."
WCPFC8,182,Mexico stated that its catches of Pacific Bluefin tuna in the Eastern Pacific Ocean have also been stable for 20-30 years.       23 7.2 Programme of Work for the Northern Committee in 2012-2014
WCPFC8,183,The Chair of the NC informed WCPFC8 of the programme of work for the NC which is contained in Attachment E of the Report of NC7 (WCPFC6-2011/16).
WCPFC8,184,FFA members expressed support for the NC’s programme of work.
WCPFC8,185,WCPFC8 accepted the report of the Northern Committee and its programme of work.   AGENDA  ITEM  8  -  TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE ISSUES 8.1 Report of the Seventh Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee
WCPFC8,186,"Holly Koehler, Vice Chair of the TCC, presented the TCC7 report (WCPFC8-2011/17 (Rev 2)).  The TCC Vice Chair noted that a matrix of TCC7 summary report outcomes and recommendations had been produced by the Secretariat (WCPFC8-2011- IP09), which cross-references the relevant TCC7 outcome with the WCPFC8 agenda item and WCPFC8 papers where Commission action is requested or needed.  The TCC Vice Chair highlighted the following specific TCC7 outcomes and topics from the TCC7 Summary Report to WCPFC8: a. No new vessels were proposed for listing on the IUU Vessel List; b. One vessel on the IUU Vessel List (Senta) is proposed for de-listing;  c. The Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS) is operating as a one-year trial and is intended to produce a Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR) for the consideration of WCPFC8; d. As the trial period is ending, a decision will be required to extend and/or revise the CMS; e. TCC7 recommended that the deadline for Part 2 Annual Reports be revised from “30 days prior to TCC” to 1 July each year;   f. The results of a study on catch attribution issues and a review of the joint WCPFC/FFA VMS have been referred to the Commission for consideration; g. Terms of Reference for a Technical Advisory Group to support the work of the Regional Observer Programme were developed for the Commission’s consideration; h. Standards, specifications and procedures for the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels were endorsed and forwarded to the Commission; i. Regarding transhipment, a one-year extension to New Zealand’s transhipment exemption was recommended and the Secretariat will prepare a paper for TCC8 on the development of guidelines for high seas transhipment from fishing vessels other than purse seine vessels (see discussion under Agenda 8.7); j. It is noted that the charter notification scheme will expire at the close of the meeting unless extended by WCPFC8, and further work on issues related to charter State access to data is likely to be required; k. Issues relating to the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area were discussed and are presented under other agenda items; l. The TCC Work Programme has been revised intersessionally; m. Ms Rhea Moss-Christian of FSM is proposed as the new TCC Chair; n. TCC8 is proposed to be held in Pohnpei, FSM."
WCPFC8,187,WCPFC8 accepted the report of the TCC.    24 8.2 Proposed WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2012
WCPFC8,188,"The TCC Vice Chair explained that no vessels were proposed to TCC for listing on the draft Provisional IUU Vessel List, therefore TCC focused its attention on whether any of the five currently listed vessels warranted de-listing (WCPFC-2011/18 (Rev 1)).  In response to a request and provision of information from Panama, the flag State of the Senta (now renamed Sun Fu Fa), TCC recommended that this vessel be removed from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.  TCC recommended that the other four vessels remain on the WPCFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC8,189,"Some CCMs expressed support for the de-listing of the Senta.  These CCMs noted that appropriate documentation had been provided by the flag State, the fine is considered sufficient, and the actions of Panama to resolve this situation have been proactive and should be encouraged."
WCPFC8,190,Other CCMs noted several concerns regarding de-listing of the Senta and requested further information from Panama.
WCPFC8,191,Panama provided additional information on the payment of the fine for the Sun Fu Fa (formerly Senta) in WCPFC8-2011-DP/43.
WCPFC8,192,"The EU and France stated that that the evidence provided does not provide sufficient information to delist, but not being the referring CCM, they abstain from the process to remove the Senta from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. Both the EU and France considered that several of the conditions for removal have not been met:    a. There is insufficient evidence that Panama’s operation of VMS can ensure compliance with WCPFC CMMs. Moreover, no proof has been provided to ensure that transhipments (particularly at sea) will observe WCPFC rules; b. The amount of the fine imposed is not a sufficient deterrent, and the fact that ownership has changed should not be considered a reason to lower the amount of the fine; and c. There is insufficient evidence to establish that there has been a real change in vessel ownership."
WCPFC8,193,WCPFC8 agreed to remove Senta (now re-named Sun Fu Fa) from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC8,194,"Chinese Taipei requested that the Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 be de-listed on the basis that the vessel’s fishing license was revoked in 2010 and the vessel has been detained in port for over three years and if delisting proposal is not agreeable to some members, there should be a footnote in the IUU vessel list that indicates this vessel’s fishing license was revoked and this vessel has been detained in port for over 3 years."
WCPFC8,195,Chinese Taipei and the Federated States of Micronesia noted that discussions regarding the Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 were ongoing and some progress was being made.
WCPFC8,196,"WCPFC8 agreed that the Neptune, the Fu Lien No. 1, the Yu Fong 168 and the Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 would remain on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.  The WCPFC IUU List for 2012 is appended as Attachment M.    25 8.3 Compliance with Conservation Measures 8.3.1 Update of Submission of Annual Reports Part 1 and Part 2"
WCPFC8,197,"WCPFC noted the Secretariat’s summary of CCMs’ submissions of Annual Reports Parts 1 and 2 (WCPFC8-2011/19), and WCPFC8 agreed to TCC7 recommendation that the deadline for Part 2 Annual Reports be revised from “30 days prior to TCC” to 1 July each year.   8.3.2 Report on the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS)"
WCPFC8,198,"The TCC Vice Chair noted two issues for WCPFC8 concerning the Compliance Monitoring Scheme:  completion of the first trial period of the scheme, and amendment and/or extension of CMM 2010-03.  At TCC7, 22 CCM’s draft Compliance Monitoring Reports (CMRs) were considered.  After TCC7, nine of these CCM’s draft CMRs were updated based on supplemental information provided by the CCM or the Scientific Services Provider.  Twelve new draft CCM CMRs were developed by the Secretariat after TCC7.  The status of the CMR’s is detailed in WCPFC8-2011/20 and WCPFC8-2011-IP/09."
WCPFC8,199,"FFA members, noting their comments in WCPFC8-2011-DP/06, stated their support for the CMS but stressed the need to make the CMR evaluation process efficient so that SIDS can participate without undue burden.  These CCMs also requested that sub-regional bodies be allowed to participate in the evaluation to assist SIDS.  The importance of the CMRs as an evaluation of implementation and a means of identifying capacity building needs was also articulated.  FFA members supported the CMS but considered that it should be implemented with regard to the other priorities of the Commission and with fairness toward all CCMs, both large and small.  Continuation of the scheme was supported by these CCMs."
WCPFC8,200,"Other CCMs also confirmed their desire that CMS continue, but acknowledged that the resources available to support the process are limited and thus attention should be paid to improving efficiency."
WCPFC8,201,FSM expressed its strong reservation for what the Commission was being asked to endorse as the 2011 Compliance Monitoring Report. This reservation was based on the process followed in the development of the Report as well as the lack of a clear understanding for what the work was intended to produce from the outset. FSM expressed its willingness to work with all members in refining the CMR process and its final outcomes next year.
WCPFC8,202,"FSM also noted that in relation to the issue of late submission of Part 2 Reports and its impact on the ability for Provisional CMRs to be developed for some countries, there was a parallel process in 2011 of streamlining the Part 2 reports and reporting process that was designed in part to address the issue of timely reporting."
WCPFC8,203,"Citing a shortage of time and competing priorities, WCPFC8 agreed to convene a SWG led by the Vice Chair of the TCC work to complete the remaining twelve draft CCM CMRs and prepare a draft final CMR for adoption by WCPFC8, and discuss whether to amend and/or extend CMM 2010-03.  It was agreed that the sub-regional bodies consisting of FFA and PNA could participate in the work of the SWG as observers and in accordance with Rule 36 of the Commission’s Rules of Procedure.  It was also agreed to defer further discussion of the options for responses to non-compliance (WCPFC8-2011-DP/34) to TCC8.  It was agreed that the process and format that was used to prepare the 2010 reports does not in anyway constitute a  26 precedent for the future operation of the scheme (as also stated in the final compliance monitoring report for 2010)."
WCPFC8,204,"The SWG reported back to WCPFC8 that it could only complete five of the twelve new CCM CMRs (Vanuatu, Kiribati, RMI, Niue and Samoa; WCPFC8-2011-DP/51), therefore the draft final CMR it produced (WCPFC8-2011/51) provides a summary of 27 CCM CMRs.  This report includes a summary matrix of the degree of implementation by CMM, rather than by CCM, and highlights some CMMs for which there are potential implementation issues.  The report highlights issues and challenges in implementing the scheme and makes and makes suggestions for work to be undertaken in 2012, and future years, to address these issues."
WCPFC8,205,"WCPFC8 discussed the report of the SWG (WCPFC8-2011/51) and requested amendments to paras 5, 7 and 12.  With these amendments WCPFC8 adopted the Compliance Monitoring Report for 2010 (Attachment N)."
WCPFC8,206,"Several CCMs spoke in favour of extending the CMS for an additional trial year stating that it was a useful and importance exercise.  However, these CCMs emphasized the need for efficiency in terms of timely submission of CCM Annual Reports Parts 1 and 2, focused work by the SWG at TCC8 (particularly as both 2010 and 2011 compliance issues will need to be considered), and sufficient time available for TCC8 to consider the results of the SWG."
WCPFC8,207,"Australia noted that after three years of leading this process it is no longer in a position to lead the intersessional work required to further develop the Compliance Monitoring  Scheme. Australia suggested that the Commission consider an alternative to lead this process. Australia thanked Ms Camille Goodman, for her work in this regard.  The WCPFC Chair acknowledged the contribution of Ms Goodman.   8.3.3 Streamlined Part 2 Annual Reports"
WCPFC8,208,"The Executive Director noted that as described in WCPFC-2011/22, work on a streamlined template for Part 2 Annual Reports is proceeding, but the direction from TCC7 for a web-based format, as well as intersessional comments from CCMs on the template itself have budgetary implications."
WCPFC8,209,WCPFC8 noted these issues and deferred further discussions of financial aspects of the work on streamlined Part 2 Annual Reports to the Finance and Administration Committee.  The FAC considered the proposed budget to streamlining the Part 2 Annual report and the Commission approved the FAC’s recommendation.  The work on streamlined Part 2 Annual Report is included within the approved budget under Part 2.3 for “Information Management System including RFV”.   8.4 Regional Observer Programme 8.4.1 Annual Regional Observer Programme Report
WCPFC8,210,WCPFC8 noted the third annual report of the Regional Observer Programme (WCPFC8-2011/24).       27 8.4.2 Draft Terms of Reference for Technical Advisory Group-ROP for Approval
WCPFC8,211,The Chair noted that terms of reference for a Technical Advisory Group to support the work of the Regional Observer Programme were recommended by TCC7 for adoption (WCPFC8-2011/25).  Given the delay in holding WCPFC8 it was recommended that the TAG-ROP should perform its work through September 2013.
WCPFC8,212,The EU noted that the TAG-ROP will deal only with operational and technical issues in accordance with the draft Terms of Reference (paragraph 1 of the TOR)
WCPFC8,213,WCPFC8 approved the terms of reference for the TAG-ROP through September 2013 (Attachment O).  Mr Phillip Lens of Papua New Guinea was appointed TAG-ROP Chair.  8.4.3 WCPFC-IATTC Cross Endorsement of Observers
WCPFC8,214,The Chair noted that since WCPFC7 two meetings have been held between the two Secretariats on this issue (WCPFC-2011-IP/03 and; WCPFC8-2011-IP/03a) and that the Executive Directors are continuing to work together to progress these issues.
WCPFC8,215,"The EU stated their view that the situation was urgent and that immediate implementation of cross-endorsement procedures is required, particularly in view of the need for observers on vessels crossing the boundary between the two RFMOs.  The EU requested that the Secretariat provide further details on how the cross-endorsement Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) will operate and expedite organisation of training for observers to be cross-endorsed."
WCPFC8,216,"PNA members noted that measures applicable to purse seiners in EEZs, such as the PNA’s Third Implementing Arrangements, would take precedence over any cross-endorsement agreements.  These CCMs further noted that purse seine vessels are required to have 100% observer coverage and these observers must be sourced from the coastal States.  The need for more observers and more resources to train them was also highlighted."
WCPFC8,217,"The EU noted that in accordance with document made available to SC7 in August 2011, observer coverage on PS operating only in one Coastal State EEZ was not 100%."
WCPFC8,218,The Executive Director suggested that observers from French Polynesia and Kiribati be the focus for initial cross-endorsement training as these CCMs are members of both Commissions.
WCPFC8,219,"The IATTC Executive Director reminded WPCFC8 that since there are different requirements in different areas, further details need to be worked out beyond the general understanding which is now in place."
WCPFC8,220,The USA supported the quick implementation of WCPFC Executive Director’s suggestion and urged the arrangement to be put in place as soon as possible.  The USA drew CCM’s attention to the successful arrangement over the last ten years’ of AIDCP-trained observers crossing from west to east.  The USA stated it would continue to support an existing fund managed by the Secretariat for observer programme support.  It noted the cadre of special observers is another mechanism for training and maintaining a pool of cross-endorsed observers.     28
WCPFC8,221,"Noting the various issues involved, WCPFC8 directed the WPCFC Executive Director to continue to work with the IATTC Executive Director to implement an arrangement for the deployment of cross-endorsed observers as soon as possible.   8.4.4 Proposal for Vessel Captains/Operators to Review WCPFC ROP Reports"
WCPFC8,222,"The EU introduced a proposal by China, the EU, Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei on ensuring the availability of the report to the flag state and the opportunity for vessel captains/operators to review and comment on observer reports (WCPFC-2011-DP/36).  The EU described the motivation for the proposed amendment to CMM 2007-01 as arising from the need for flag States to receive timely information from the ROP in order to responsibly control their vessels.  The EU noted that it is for the observer provider and not directly for the observer to ensure that the timely provision of the preliminary observer reports to the captain vessel operator and the flag state and ensure the possibility for the captain/ vessel operator to comment on it. The EU noted that it was not need to present the report while the observer was still on board, it could be while the vessel is in port. The EU further noted that, since the beginning of the operations of the ROP, it has not received any observer reports."
WCPFC8,223,"Other CCMs supporting the proposal reiterated the importance of receiving timely feedback from the observers, explained that this feedback was not being received, and urged the Commission to avoid further delays in addressing this issue."
WCPFC8,224,"FFA members voiced concerns about observer safety and independence if the data were required to be provided before disembarking the vessel.  These CCMs noted that the flag States already have access to the observer reports (under CMM 2007-01, para 2 (l) of Annex A)."
WCPFC8,225,"The USA stated that it was generally supportive of the proposed amendment but also appreciated the difference between providing the reports to the Commission or national programme, and providing the reports to the captains of the vessels.  The USA advocated that a process (e.g. specifying timing, mechanism, etc.) which both protects the observer and delivers the necessary information to the flag State should be designed by the TAG-ROP for consideration by TCC."
WCPFC8,226,The EU stated that it is not a technical question but a political decision and therefore it is not under the competence of the TAG-ROP.
WCPFC8,227,"FFA spoke as an observer provider to the ROP noting that data are currently being provided to the flag States.  FFA believes there are ambiguities in the language of the proposal, and a significant danger that there would be retaliation against observers by previously observed vessels’ crew or related vessels’ crew."
WCPFC8,228,Other CCMs stressed that flag CCMs in fact could not receive observer data in a timely manner because data provision from observer provider to WCPFC have been often delayed as described in WCPFC 2011/24.
WCPFC8,229,"Noting that it is a requirement of CMM 2007-01, WCPFC8 referred the operational issues of provision of observer reports of observed vessels to the TAG-ROP for further discussion, however WCPFC8 noted that any policy discussions on this issue must be held within TCC and by the Commission.      29 8.5 Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) 8.5.1 Annual Report of the Vessel Monitoring System"
WCPFC8,230,The Chair drew the meeting’s attention to the Secretariat’s annual report on the VMS (WCPFC-2011/26) and review of VMS data integrity and security (WCPFC8-2011-IP/07).
WCPFC8,231,FFA members commented that the annual report was informative and highlighted operational issues and challenges.  These CCMs were pleased that an agreement with FFA for lower Service Level Agreement fees has been negotiated as this represents a cost savings to all WCPFC CCMs.
WCPFC8,232,"One CCM noted with concern that only 54% of vessels report to the WCPFC’s VMS, and that the basis for the SLA fee reduction was not clear."
WCPFC8,233,"The Executive Director clarified that the SLA fees were reduced by $300,000 through a detailed negotiation process.  Quarterly meetings continue to be held between the Secretariat and FFA to discuss VMS issues."
WCPFC8,234,One CCM asked the reasons for not distributing the VMS security audit of 2010 and about the follow up of the finding identified in the VMS security audit of 2010. It advocated for the VMS Security audit to be carried out in 2012..
WCPFC8,235,"The Executive Director noted that the 2010 audit was not completed by the external consultant.  Starting in 2012 an annual VMS audit will be undertaken and it will include an audit of the Commission’s data security rules, which are considered adequate, are being effectively implemented by the Secretariat.   8.5.2 Joint WCPFC/FFA Review of the WCPFC VMS"
WCPFC8,236,"Mr Robert Martinolich presented the independent review report (WCPFC-2011/27) explaining that it included visits to ten countries, with input from 21 individuals representing 13 organizations.  The objective of the review was to analyse the cost and structure of the current VMS arrangements in the Pacific to ensure they are delivering an effective service.  The following recommendations from the study were highlighted:  a. FFA and WCPFC should continue to work cooperatively and collaboratively; b. The objectives of the respective VMSs should be defined; c. Both organizations should work toward developing a central database;  d. Responsibilities should be migrated from commercial service providers to fishery management organizations; e. Data sharing procedures should be expanded to a wider range of users under strict confidentiality guidelines; f. WCPFC should adopt FFA’s approved ALC list; g. Costs should be reduced by reducing packet size, rationalising polling rates and eliminating redundant data transmissions; h. The SLA should be replaced with a legally binding agreement which is reviewed annually; and i. The SLA should be amended to allow the WCPFC to liaise directly with the service provider.    30  The overall findings of the review indicated that while there is room for improvement, the FFA is delivering on all components of the agreement and the VMS is meeting the basic needs of the Commission."
WCPFC8,237,The Executive Director presented the comments of a SWG convened at TCC on the recommendations of the independent review (WCPFC8-2011/36).  Seven recommendations were identified as high priority including cost reduction measures and amendment of the SLA.
WCPFC8,238,"Several CCMs, including the EU which provided a paper to WCPFC7 on this issue (WCPFC7-2010-DP29), stressed the importance and urgency of achieving cost savings and noted that some of the recommendations of the review report on reducing costs could be implemented immediately."
WCPFC8,239,"Some of these CCMs stated that they believe the objectives of the VMS are already adequately defined, and discussions on objectives or attributes should not delay the implementation of cost saving measures or add to the workload of TCC."
WCPFC8,240,"In response to a question, Mr Martinolich and the Executive Director explained that some of the VMS redundancies arise from the Commission’s original specifications to construct two separate systems (FFA and WCPFC) which can work together.  One way of reducing costs would be to merge these systems into one database with appropriate firewalls.  To the question of the EU whether there are further immediate savings that can be made beyond the reduction of fees by FFA, Mr Martinolich responded positively and mentioned as an example the reduction of the number of VMS messages packages from two to one. The EU requested to have this reflected in the summary record as a clear signal that other CCMs do not have as a priority the optimisation of high VMS costs."
WCPFC8,241,"FFA members noted that the review report confirms that the FFA is meeting all requirements for the VMS and that the joint VMS model is working.  These CCMs stated the importance of defining objectives for the VMS and referred WCPFC8 to a paper which outlines their ideas in this regard (WCPFC8-2011-DP/41).  FFA members proposed that the Commission task a SWG to work intersessionally by electronic means to:    a. Identify the needs, purposes and attributes of the Commission VMS; b. Review the existing VMS Standards, Specification and Procedures (SSPs) and CMM 2007-02 to determine if they meet the needs, purposes and attributes identified in (a) and if not, provide recommended changes to the SSPs and CMM 2007-02.    In addition, FFA members requested the Secretariat engage FFA to prepare the functional specifications and costs of the enhanced system envisaged by the TCC7 SWG (WCPFC8-2011/36) with consideration to meeting identified needs, avoiding duplication, protecting confidentiality and providing a “stand alone” system.  FFA members proposed Mr Colin Brown of the Cook Islands and Mr Stan Crothers of Tokelau as the Co-Chairs of the VMS SWG."
WCPFC8,242,Papua New Guinea pointed out the different issues involved when considering a VMS and an information management system.  It suggested that the Commission should be reciprocally sharing data with FFA just as FFA shares data with the Commission when vessels move from EEZs onto the high seas.     31
WCPFC8,243,Some CCMs expressed concerns about the cost implications of creating an information management system capable of data analysis.
WCPFC8,244,"In response to questions from CCMs, the Executive Director explained that the redundant system in Guam is for backup/data security purposes only and that the Secretariat is developing protocols for reducing polling rates for vessels entering EEZs or leaving the Convention Area in high seas areas."
WCPFC8,245,"WCPFC8 agreed to convene an intersessional SWG on VMS, co-chaired by Mr Colin Brown and Mr Stan Crothers to progress the two tasks identified in paragraph 229 above, related to the priority recommendations from the review report, for the consideration of TCC8.   8.5.3 VMS Template Agreement"
WCPFC8,246,"The USA introduced their proposal for a VMS template agreement (WCPFC8-2011-DP/30) explaining that the proposal has been modified based on comments received at TCC7.  Rather than proposing a template agreement per se, the current proposal contains language on key issues that, if agreed to by CCMs, would provide the basis for exchange of VMS data between national programmes and the Commission VMS."
WCPFC8,247,"RMI introduced their proposal (WCPFC8-2011-DP/40) which calls for the Commission VMS to provide data to coastal States when vessels on the Commission VMS enter the national waters of the coastal State.  This could either be accomplished through instructing the Secretariat to provide these data, or by amending the VMS SSPs to provide the data automatically.  RMI characterised this proposal at “flicking the switch” to allow coastal States to see the VMS data from vessels in their EEZs which are transmitting to the Commission’s VMS."
WCPFC8,248,"FFA members expressed their strong support for the RMI proposal and referred to key provisions in WCPFC documents which reinforce their position (WCPFC8-2011-DP/40).  FFA member comments highlighted the vulnerability of SIDS to encroachment by IUU fishing activities, and the importance of effective MCS tools such as VMS in combatting such activities.  These CCMs emphasized the urgent need for agreement to resolve this issue."
WCPFC8,249,"FSM expressed its disappointment that the proposed text on implementation of Article 24(8) was not accepted by all members and noted that it was currently moving toward implementing national legislation to require unlicensed vessels transiting through the FSM EEZ to report to the appropriate national authorities. FSM also commented that it has a signed bilateral agreement with the Commission Secretariat to receive Commission VMS data for its EEZ and that the agreement was put on hold after the Honolulu Commission meeting changed the template process. In that regard, the FSM supported Niue’s request to receive Commission VMS data for unlicensed vessels transiting their EEZ."
WCPFC8,250,"In response to questions from Canada, the Executive Director clarified that FFA members share their EEZ VMS data with each other through the FFA VMS.  RMI stated there would be no additional cost implications arising from adoption of their proposal and that the proposal is intended to apply to all vessels in the EEZs of coastal States whether they are fishing or transiting."
WCPFC8,251,"Some CCMs expressed concerns about the application of the proposal to vessels which are transiting and noted that while there were acceptable elements of both the USA and the RMI proposals, further discussion and drafting would be necessary to develop text that could be agreed.    32"
WCPFC8,252,France explained that its proposal for an EEZ entry-exit notification scheme (WCPFC8-2011-DP/19) is closely related to these issues and is designed to strengthen systems for monitoring of EEZs.  France suggested that discussions continue via an intercessional SWG.
WCPFC8,253,The EU stated that it is open to work for an agreement as far as it is in line with international law and UNCLOS rules.
WCPFC8,254,"The WCPFC Chair directed the USA, RMI and France, as well as other interested CCMs, to meet in the margins of WCPFC8 to explore the potential for a consolidated draft proposal."
WCPFC8,255,The USA and RMI developed a joint proposal that was circulated as WCPFC8-2011-DP/30 (Rev 3).
WCPFC8,256,"Some CCMs stated that while they understood the needs of the coastal States, they could not agree to the proposal as they had potential concerns regarding compliance with international law and insufficient time to examine the proposal in detail."
WCPFC8,257,RMI expressed disappointment with the position taken by some CCMs and noted that one option for coastal States would be to develop their own national VMSs.
WCPFC8,258,Other FFA members also expressed their disappointment.
WCPFC8,259,Niue asked that data from all CCM-flagged vessels present in the EEZ of Niue and reporting to the Commission’s VMS be provided to Niue.
WCPFC8,260,Some CCMs stated their support for Niue’s request.
WCPFC8,261,The Cook Islands suggested that there is a need for a technical working group to ensure consistency between individual requests from SIDS for Commission VMS data in their EEZs.
WCPFC8,262,France informed WCPFC8 that it appreciated the work that had been done to progress the issues associated with the VMS template agreement as such work may address be able to address the concerns which prompted it to develop the EEZ entry-exit notification scheme proposal.
WCPFC8,263,WCPFC8 agreed that the Commission would provide Niue with VMS data for fishing vessels present in the Niue EEZ which are reporting to the Commission VMS.
WCPFC8,264,WCPFC8 agreed that the joint US and RMI proposal WCPFC8-2011-DP/30 (Rev 3) be further elaborated at TCC8.
WCPFC8,265,NOTE: Please note Circular No 2012/?? Concerning the Chairs final decision regarding this issue. 8.5.4 VMS ALC/MTU Template Checklist for Auditing Units
WCPFC8,266,WCPFC8 was informed that the Secretariat has developed an audit template for use by CCMs when conducting periodic audits of a representative sample of installed ALCs/MTUs (WCPFC-2011/28 (Rev 1)).     33
WCPFC8,267,Japan thanked the Secretariat for the template but stated that it might not use the exact format for the reporting to the Secretariat since it might be necessary to modify it for domestic use.
WCPFC8,268,FFA members stated that some amendments to the draft template would be required to align it with CMM 2007-02.
WCPFC8,269,"The WCPFC Chair requested CCMs to provide comments on the template to the Secretariat, and directed the Secretariat to present a revised draft of the template to TCC8.   8.5.5 VMS SSP Bracketed Text"
WCPFC8,270,"WCPFC8 noted that TCC8 discussed issues related to manual reporting requirements in the VMS SSPs, and the bracketed text in the VMS SSPs, remain unresolved."
WCPFC8,271,WCPFC8 referred further discussion of the issues associated with bracketed text in the VMS SSPs to TCC8.   8.5.6 Proposed Amendment to CMM 2007-02 VMS
WCPFC8,272,WCPFC8 noted TCC’s recommendation to revise CMM 2007-02 to remove the requirement for “a single length of unbroken cable to the antenna” in the Draft Minimum Standards for ALCs used in the Commission VMS (WCPFC-2011-DP/31).
WCPFC8,273,"WCPFC8 adopted the revised CMM 2007-02 on the Commission Vessel Monitoring System contained in WCPFC8-2011-DP/31, as CMM 2011-02 (Attachment P).   8.6 Record of Fishing Vessels (RFV) – Standards, Specification and Procedures"
WCPFC8,274,"The USA introduced a proposal, endorsed by TCC7, to institute standards, specifications and procedures for the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC-2011/37).  The USA explained that the intent of the proposal is to produce a RFV which is as accurate and cost-effective as possible."
WCPFC8,275,"Some CCMs, citing the endorsement by TCC7, supported the proposal as presented."
WCPFC8,276,"FFA members supported some components of the proposal but expressed some reservations about the procedures included, in particular whether there should be requirements for minimum fields.  FFA members suggested that a decision on this issue be deferred to allow for further discussion."
WCPFC8,277,"The EU questioned whether the RFV can be used to provide the Commission with information on the number of vessels actively fishing in the Convention Area.  If so, the EU requested that this information is provided to TCC8 and WCPFC9 and on a yearly basis in all future WCPFC meetings."
WCPFC8,278,WCPFC Compliance Manager confirmed that the RFV can be used for this purpose and this information can be provided to both TCC8 and the WCPFC9 based on the CCM reports under CMM 2009-01 paragraph 9 (“fished” or “did not fish” reports).     34 8.7 NZ Transhipment Approval
WCPFC8,279,"The Chair, noting the paper provided by New Zealand (WCPFC8-2011-DP/02), recalled that TCC7 recommended to WCPFC8 that New Zealand’s application for an exemption from the prohibition on at-sea transhipment from purse seine vessels be approved."
WCPFC8,280,FFA members voiced their support for New Zealand’s application on the grounds that the conditions for exemption as provided for in CMM 2009-06 have been met.  These CCMs suggested that a multi-year (rather than annual) exemption could be considered to improve the efficiency of Commission decision-making.
WCPFC8,281,"These CCMs also stated their concerns regarding transhipments from longline vessels which, under CMM 2009-06, have a variety of requirements, including notification to the Secretariat, and which do not appear to be consistently adhered to.  These issues should be addressed through revision of the CMM including consideration of a ban on high seas transhipments."
WCPFC8,282,"The Executive Director noted that from the inception of the CMM 2009-06 (July 1 2010) until October 2011 the Secretariat received 878 notifications of transhipment.  The scale of this activity was somewhat surprising and has prompted the Secretariat to consider potential linkages between transhipment and IUU fishing activities.  In accordance with paragraph 37 of CMM 2009-06, the Secretariat will prepare a paper for TCC8 on guidelines for high seas transhipment from fishing vessels other than purse seines (WCPFC8-2011-IP/08)."
WCPFC8,283,Other CCMs also supported New Zealand’s application but considered than an annual exemption process is most appropriate.
WCPFC8,284,WCPFC8 approved New Zealand’s application for an exemption from the prohibition on at-sea transhipment from purse seine vessels for a one-year period until the 29th of May 2013.   8.8 Kobe III Outcomes Capacity and IUU Listings
WCPFC8,285,"The Executive Director presented the compliance and management recommendations of the Kobe III meeting held in La Jolla, USA in July 2011 (WCPFC-2011/29).  One of these recommendations is being presented to WCPFC8 as a proposal by the EU, Japan and the USA on the management of purse seine fishing capacity (see WCPFC8-2011-DP/52 and Agenda Item 14).  He noted that the Kobe process will continue as a meeting of the Chairs and Executive Directors of the tuna RFMOs at COFI in July 2012, and that input from CCMs was sought to inform this upcoming meeting."
WCPFC8,286,"FFA members noted with satisfaction the recognition of the rights and aspiration of SIDS embodied in the Kobe III recommendations.  These CCMs look forward to learning what steps CCMs will take in light of these recommendations, the requirements of Article 30 of the Convention, and Resolution 2008-01.  FFA members also supported the improved harmonization of t-RFMO IUU Vessel Lists."
WCPFC8,287,"The USA added that they would like to see the Kobe III process undertake further work on issues of fishing capacity, IUU Vessel Lists, decision rules on management measures, unique vessel identifiers and records of fishing vessels, and consistent compliance and capacity building procedures across the t-RFMOs.    35 8.9 Programme of Work for the Technical and Compliance Committee in 2012-2014"
WCPFC8,288,"The Executive Director drew WCPFC8’s attention to the draft TCC work programme for 2012-2014 (WCPFC-2011/30), noting that it had been revised based on FFA comments received subsequent to TCC7 (WCPFC8-2011-DP/08) and was under discussion in the FAC with regard to the financial implications of the streamlined Annual Report template."
WCPFC8,289,"Japan considered that it is premature to assume that the outcome of direct entry of observer data would result in a cost savings, and questioned the need to expend $35,000 on this item.  Japan also stated that it strongly supported calls for streamlining and prioritisation of the work of the TCC."
WCPFC8,290,The Executive Director agreed that this item should be removed from the 2012 budget pending a full evaluation of the observer data direct entry trials.
WCPFC8,291,"The USA stated its view that the TCC work plan was a helpful exercise but advocated that the Commission should identify the priority tasks for the TCC and these should be the basis of the TCC work plans. The USA supported the priorities identified by the FFA in WCPFC8-2011-DP/08 but also considered that port state measures, the catch documentation scheme and the continuation of the CMS were also priorities."
WCPFC8,292,"The Chair directed the Secretariat to take account of these comments when revising the TCC Work Plan for presentation toTCC8.   AGENDA  ITEM  9  -  CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES 9.1 New CMMs 9.1.1 CMM 2011-01 for Bigeye, Skipjack and Yellowfin Tuna (CMM 2008-01)"
WCPFC8,293,"Dr John Hampton of SPC, the WCPFC Scientific Services Provider, presented a review of the implementation of effectiveness of CMM 2008-01 (WCPFC8-2011/43 (Rev 1)).  Dr Hampton explained that the paper consists of two parts:  a review of the implementation of measures pertaining to purse seine effort, FAD closure, high seas pocket closures, and longline catch; and generic and specific projections of future conditions based on results of the 2011 stock assessments (i.e. 2010 conditions)."
WCPFC8,294,"Dr Hampton noted that assessment of the ability of the measure to reduce purse seine effort by 30% from 2001-2004 or 2004 levels did not take into account effort by purse seine fleets based in Indonesia or the Philippines because of the lack of purse seine effort data from those fleets.  The conclusion of the assessment is that CMM 2008-01 has not been effective in restricting total purse seine effort:  in 2009 effort increased by 13%, in 2010 effort increased by 18% and in 2011 (based on VMS data, as logsheet data have not yet been compiled) effort increased by 31% over the baseline."
WCPFC8,295,"Evaluation of the FAD closures was based on data from 2009-2010 only.  Observers reported that the days during which there were reports of activities associated with drifting FADs during the FAD closure period were 14% for 2009 and 5.8% for 2010.  Observers also reported greater use of fish aggregation lights during night time in the FAD closure in 2010 (6.2%) versus 2009 (2.2%).  An unusual pattern was observed in 2010 when FAD usage remained low even after the FAD closure period ended.  During the closure periods catches of skipjack and yellowfin  36 tuna declined slightly (though sizes increased so catch value remained nearly constant), but there was a notable decline in the catch of bigeye tuna.  This is due to the fact that very few bigeye tuna are caught in unassociated purse seine sets."
WCPFC8,296,"Dr Hampton noted that historically purse seine effort within the high seas pockets represented 14% of managed purse seine effort, but that based on logsheet, observer and VMS data high seas pocket effort has been eliminated.  However, it is likely that much of this effort has been transferred to other areas, rather than completely removed from the fishery.  An exception to this is the catch reduction by the Philippines which is likely to be directly attributable to the high seas pocket closures.  Although it is thus not likely that high seas pocket effort was eliminated from the fishery, it is worthwhile considering whether total effort would have been even higher if the high seas pockets had remained open."
WCPFC8,297,"Another objective of CMM 2008-01 was to reduce longline catch by 30% from baseline periods of 2001-2004 or 2004.  The assessment showed that catches have declined since 2008 and that 2010 catches represented a 23% reduction on the 2001-2004 average.  If the trend of reduced catches continued in 2011, CMM 2008-01 is likely to meet its objective.  However, this decrease in catches has occurred despite the fact that effort has remained constant; this raises the possibility that the catch reductions are due to stock declines."
WCPFC8,298,"In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the measure, projections were made using a variety of assumptions (WCPFC8-2011/43a and WCPFC8-2011/43b).  Projections based on conditions in 2009 showed that fishing mortality for bigeye tuna remained well above MSY levels.  In contrast, projections based on conditions in 2010, which incorporated a 17% decrease in longline catch, a 32% decrease in purse seine FAD effort, and a 33% decrease in catch by Indonesia and Philippines fleets from 2009 leves, resulted in the stock attaining MSY levels by the end of the 10 year projection."
WCPFC8,299,"Evaluation of total purse seine closures versus FAD closures found little difference between the two with regard to effects on the bigeye tuna stock.  This is because most bigeye tuna are caught in associated sets, therefore allowing the unassociated portion of the fishery to remain in operation has little effect on bigeye tuna catches.  In contrast, total tuna catch is expected to decrease from 2.3 million t to 1.8 million t under a total purse seine fishery closure scenario."
WCPFC8,300,"Finally, Dr Hampton’s analysis evaluated the influence of exemptions on the effectiveness of CMM 2008-01.  The exemptions were modelled as scaling factors (scalars) as described in WCPFC7-2010/15 but applied to the latest stock assessment results.  Removal of the exemptions was estimated to potentially remove approximately 50% of the overfishing estimated to occur under CMM 2008-01."
WCPFC8,301,"In response to questions posed by Japan, Dr Hampton clarified that the fish aggregation lights reported by observers were underwater lights.  He also explained that the reported differences in catch during closure and non-closure periods, and reported differences in fish sizes, had taken account of sampling bias and stratification and were thus valid.  Dr Hampton stated that the VMS data used as a proxy for effort in 2011 should be representative of fishing effort related to the increase in small longliners fishing in the Convention Area.  With regard to the modelling of the total closure of the purse seine fishery, Dr Hampton clarified that that three months of effort (i.e. during the closure) were assumed to be removed from the fishery rather than transferred to other (non-closure) months.     37"
WCPFC8,302,FFA members considered that the results presented by Dr Hampton confirmed that additional measures are required to reduce the overfishing of bigeye tuna.
WCPFC8,303,"Chinese Taipei noted the ease of enforcement of a total closure and suggested that when modelling the total closure of the purse seine fishery it would have been more realistic to model a 2.4 month closure rather than a 6 month closure.  Similarly, when modelling the high seas pocket closure it was suggested to assume that effort is redistributed rather than eliminated.  Finally, it was noted that using VMS data as a proxy for logbook data may tend to overestimate effort."
WCPFC8,304,"Dr Hampton replied that the methodology for using VMS data to estimate effort is in the early stages of development, and is being used as a relative rather than as an absolute index of effort."
WCPFC8,305,"The EU asked 1) whether the projects that compare respectively a total seasonal closure and a seasonal FAD closure assume perfect implementation of each closure option, 2) whether, if the projections assumed better implementation of the total seasonal closure than the FAD closure, the conservation benefits to bigeye would be even greater than in the current projection which assume equal implantation of the two types of closures; and 30 whether, since 2009, when CMM 2008/01 came into force, the purse seine fishing effort that falls under the various exemptions has grown or remained stable."
WCPFC8,306,"In response to the questions from the EU, Dr Hampton clarified that currently received and processed purse seine observer data represent a coverage rate of about 50% of the total purse seine effort, and that as long as this coverage is representative valid conclusions can be drawn.  He reiterated that 2010 was an unusual year because there was a very low rate of reported FAD usage.  SPC uses a statistical methodology to estimate the species composition for associated and unassociated sets.  Dr Hampton clarified that natural log and debris sets are considered to be associated (i.e. FAD) sets in the analysis.  In response to concerns that La Niña conditions have shifted fishing effort to the west and into areas of higher scientific uncertainty (e.g. archipelagic waters) and higher potential conservation value (e.g. spawning areas), Dr Hampton explained that there are ample observer data for the archipelagic waters of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and that purse seine catches contain a higher proportion of bigeye tuna in the east than in the west."
WCPFC8,307,"In response to a question from Nauru regarding whether the assessment of the high seas pocket closure took account of the effort of the Philippines fleet, Dr Hampton replied that there is no direct measure of effort by the Philippines fleet since 2004.  Nevertheless, catches in 2010 showed a 30% reduction and this is likely to be related to the removal of the Philippines fleet’s effort from the western high seas pocket."
WCPFC8,308,"In response to a question from China regarding the overall magnitude of the bigeye tuna catch by the purse seine fleet, Dr Hampton noted that the proportion of the total purse seine catch that is bigeye tuna is small, however, this purse seine catch represents approximately half of the bigeye tuna catch within the WCPF Convention Area."
WCPFC8,309,China stated that it considers that the total catch of bigeye tuna is probably underestimated.
WCPFC8,310,PNA members noted that a greater focus on unassociated purse seine sets would likely reduce fishing mortality on bigeye tuna and should be encouraged.    38
WCPFC8,311,Korea requested confirmation that the outcome for bigeye tuna of a total purse seine closure versus a FAD closure is very similar.
WCPFC8,312,Dr Hampton reiterated that this is the case because most bigeye tuna are caught in associated sets which are prohibited during both the FAD closure and the total closure.
WCPFC8,313,"The EU queried whether La Niña conditions weakened in 2011 and whether bigeye tuna are more vulnerable to the east or simply more abundant, since longline catch rates are also higher in the East. The EU also noted that big eye tuna is indeed more vulnerable to purse seine in the eastern portion of the fishing grounds."
WCPFC8,314,"Dr Hampton confirmed that these points appear to be true, and stated that there is some evidence from tagging data that bigeye tuna are indeed more vulnerable to purse seine in the eastern portion of the fishing grounds."
WCPFC8,315,"In response to a suggestion from Japan that perhaps the observed increase in size in yellowfin tuna is due to a shift toward a greater number of unassociated sets, Dr Hampton noted that a high proportion of unassociated sets continued even after the FAD closure period ended."
WCPFC8,316,"In response to requests and comments from CCMs across the floor, the WCPFC Legal Advisor provided his opinion on which components of CMM 2008-01 would expire as of the close of WCPFC8 (see WCPFC8-2011/44 and WCPFC8-2011/45) based on a textual interpretation of the measure as a whole (WCPFC8-2011/47).  Dr Tsamenyi considered that:    a. the preamble, objectives and rules of general application (paras 1-7) are not time bound and do not expire.  However some of these paragraphs are linked to subsequent paragraphs which expire and thus may become redundant or may require revision; b. the purse seine provisions for 2009 (paras.11-22), including the provisions on closure of the high seas pockets are time bound and therefore expire; and c. the longline fishery measures (paras.31-38) are also time bound and expire."
WCPFC8,317,The WCPFC Chair concluded that there could be many different legal interpretations regarding the expiry of CMM 2008-01 components but that this did not prevent WCPFC8 from entering into discussions on improving the measure.
WCPFC8,318,"FFA members introduced their paper containing proposals for the new measure (WCPFC8-2011-DP/09) and responded to the Chair’s draft contained in WCPFC8-2011/31.  While these CCMs considered the Chair’s draft a worthwhile basis for discussion, they noted that exemptions for SIDS had not been included and that by transferring a disproportionate burden to SIDS that the proposal was inconsistent with Article 30 of the Convention.  These CCMs also considered that additional measures, beyond those required in CMM 2008-01 would be required to reduce overfishing of bigeye tuna and protect skipjack stocks.  They noted that the PNA’s ban on high seas fishing by those purse seiners operating in PNA waters would continue and as such they would expect to see compatible measures implemented by the WCPFC.  FFA members also supported the development of reference points and the USA proposal to allow elements of CMM 2008-01 to continue to be in effect until a new measure is adopted.  These CCMs saw merit in some other CCM proposals such as the EU’s proposal to levy fees for high seas fishing, the USA’s proposal for transfers of catch limits among CCMs, and Japan’s support for PNA management measures in tropical waters.     39"
WCPFC8,319,The USA stated that its position with regard to CMM 2008-01 was to ensure that stocks are managed based on the best available science and application of the precautionary principle (WCPFC8-2011-DP/14).  The USA also emphasized the importance of compliance monitoring and the ability to assess the effectiveness of the measure in order for the work of the Commission to be transparent and accountable.
WCPFC8,320,"The EU summarized its views, presented in WCPFC8-2011-DP/24, WCPFC8-2011-DP/25 and WCPFC8-2011-DP/38, and stated that it considered that CMM 2008-01 had not been effective.  A total purse seine closure (rather than a FAD closure) was recommended as it would be easier to enforce.  The EU also advocated strengthening the requirements for FAD management plans, a freeze on capacity of non-SIDS flag State purse seine capacity at 2010 levels, and re-opening of the high seas pockets with fees paid by users of the pockets supporting a fund to enhance border States’ MCS capabilities.  In response to the suggestion that greater control on fishing effort was needed in high seas areas, the EU pointed out that most of the catch occurred in EEZs.  Therefore, it is important to verify that the VDS is aligned with the scientific advice and is functioning in an effective and transparent manner.  The effort reduction required under CMM 2008-01 can also not be met if the effort in the EEZs is maintained at 2010 levels."
WCPFC8,321,"Japan expressed its concern regarding the pole and line skipjack fishery in its waters which is diminishing substantially year by year.  Although range contraction has been suggested as an explanation, Japan believes the stock is being depleted and asked the Commission to take measures in tropical waters to prevent further depletion.  With regard to the need to limit longline fishing effort, Japan noted that this has already been reduced by 30% through actions by Japan, Chinese Taipei and Korea, while effort in the purse seine fishery has increased by a similar amount.  Japan referred to its proposal for capacity limits (WCPFC8-2011-DP/52, see Agenda Item 14), and the proposal by RMI (WCPFC8-2011-DP/39), as useful steps toward controlling purse seine effort."
WCPFC8,322,RMI presented its proposal on capacity reduction which consists of two components:  capping the number of purse seine vessels at 220; and transferring those vessels to PNA members according to a pre-agreed allocation plan (WCPFC8-2011-DP/39).  RMI noted that their proposal addresses both the need to reduce fishing effort to maintain stocks and the need to acknowledge the fishery development rights and aspirations of SIDS.
WCPFC8,323,The Philippines stated that the closure of the western high seas pocket caused fishing effort to shift into the Philippines EEZ and resulted in greater impacts on spawning stocks.  It proposes to limit its fishing effort in the western high seas pocket (HSP1) to 36 ice boats which will comply with all WCPFC CMMs (WCPFC8-2011-DP/42).
WCPFC8,324,Nauru proposed to prohibit distant-water longline fishing within the fully-enclosed high seas pockets between 10oN and 20oS.  Nauru noted that this proposal could have a positive effect on bigeye tuna stocks as well as reduce the potential for IUU fishing by making it more difficult for unlicensed longline vessels to encroach on the EEZs surrounding the pockets (WCPFC8-2011-DP/45).
WCPFC8,325,"PNA members stated their view that the PNA has taken strong measures to control the purse seine fishery and it is now time for the longline fishery to take action to protect bigeye tuna stocks.  It was noted that while CMM 2008-01 may expire, PNA management measures will continue and in addition, PNA members are developing a longline vessel day scheme.  With regard to the Chair’s draft for CMM 2011-01, PNA members considered that SIDS exemptions  40 had been wrongly omitted, and that a three-month FAD closure and the high seas pocket closure should continue."
WCPFC8,326,PNA members also referred to their proposal for WCPFC to close all high seas areas between 10oN and 20oS latitude and 170oE and 150oW longitude to purse seine fishing (WCPFC8-2011-DP/01).  These CCMs noted that the Commission’s control of high seas areas was lagging behind PNA members’ control of the EEZs and resulting in a continuing potential to use the high seas pockets as havens for IUU fishing.
WCPFC8,327,"The United States reminded delegates of their position on the circumstances of the Hawaii fresh longline fleet, which was reflected in CMM 2008-01 paragraph 35. (Attachment Q)"
WCPFC8,328,American Samoa associated itself and the other US territories with the previously articulated aspirations of SIDS to develop and diversify fisheries in a responsible manner.
WCPFC8,329,"WCPFC8 continued discussion of CMM 2008-01 and the Chair’s draft (WCPFC8-2011/46 ) in a series of SWG sessions chaired by the WCPFC Vice Chair, Mr Matthew Hooper of New Zealand.  A revised draft measure was produced and circulated as WCPFC8-2011/46 (Rev 1)."
WCPFC8,330,WCPFC8 then agreed to convene a heads of delegation meeting to develop a temporary measure based on a subset of issues on which agreement could be reached.  The results of these discussions were circulated as WCFPC8-2011/53.
WCPFC8,331,PNA members noted that the temporary measure required a polling rate of every half hour during the FAD closure.  They reminded WCPFC8 that PNA required polling every hour and questioned whether VMS costs would rise.
WCPFC8,332,"The EU responded that according to its calculations costs would rise by $23,000 per year.  The EU considered that this amount was reasonable given the additional assurance of compliance the higher polling rate would provide."
WCPFC8,333,"As CCMs could not reach agreement on a polling rate, the requirement to increase the polling rate was deleted from the temporary measure."
WCPFC8,334,"Discussion across the floor clarified that the intention of WCPFC8 was for the entire CMM 2008-01 measure, with the exception of 17a and 22, to remain in effect until 28 February 2013."
WCPFC8,335,Mexico questioned the appropriateness of imposing a catch limit on China in the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area.
WCPFC8,336,"CCMs noted other minor clarifications and wording changes including replacing “catcher vessels” with “fishing vessels” (throughout the document), changing “proposes to limit” to “shall limit” (para. 10), specifying where text refers to Philippine vessels only, and other typos to be corrected in the final editing of the temporary measure."
WCPFC8,337,"WCPFC8 adopted the draft decision document (WCPFC8-2011/53), as amended through discussion (CMM 2011-01, Attachment R), as a temporary extension of CMM 2008-01 until 28 February 2013 given the expiry of elements of CMM 2008-01.  The Chair  41 committed to a process to have a new measure developed prior to WCPFC9 based on comments from WCPFC8."
WCPFC8,338,"The WCPFC Chair, noting the advice of the Legal Advisor at the Heads of Delegation meeting on the potential options concerning the application of Article 20 (5) of the Convention, confirmed the general understanding of WCPFC8 that the decision will take immediate effect following WCPFC8 (commencing 31 March 2012).  WCPFC8 agreed that waiving of the 60 day rule in Article 20(5) of the Convention shall not be a precedent.     9.2 Consideration of new measures and other conservation requirements 9.2.1 Port State Measures"
WCPFC8,339,"The EU introduced its proposal for a CMM on port state measures (WCPFC8-2011-DP/26 and WCPFC8-2011-DP/27).  As the FAO Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) requires ratification by another 21 States before it can enter into force, the EU is promoting a regional approach to implementing port state measures as a tool for combatting IUU fishing.  The EU proposal is based on the FAO PSMA and has been modified since TCC7 based on comments received from FFA."
WCPFC8,340,"FFA members stated their support for port state measures but expressed reservations about using the FAO PSMA as the basis for a WCPFC CMM.  These CCMs considered that the EU’s proposal duplicates tools in place through the WCPFC, regionally or nationally; places undue burdens on SIDS to implement the measures; and presents loopholes and inconsistencies.  FFA members suggested that a gap analysis should first be conducted to identify what needs a port state measure should fulfil."
WCPFC8,341,"Several CCMs expressed support for a port state measure which is appropriate for the WCPFC fisheries and CCMs’ capacity to implement, and suggested that more work would be necessary before WCPFC could agree a new CMM which could be effectively implemented by its members."
WCPFC8,342,The Pew Environment Group stated that it has conducted a gap analysis and offered to assist CCMs with understanding the needs and opportunities for implementing port state measures.
WCPFC8,343,The EU noted that this gap analysis has already been conducted and questioned what more analysis was necessary.
WCPFC8,344,The WCPFC Chair suggested that CCMs continue to work intersessionally toward developing a proposal on port state measures for the consideration of TCC8.  CCMs were encouraged to provide further comments or proposals to the Secretariat.
WCPFC8,345,WCPFC8 agreed to continue to work intersessionally toward developing a proposal on port state measures for the consideration of TCC8.     42 9.2.2 Prohibition of Purse Seine Fishing Associated with Whale Sharks and Cetaceans
WCPFC8,346,WCPFC8 noted the information paper provided by the Scientific Services Provider concerning purse seine interactions with whale sharks and cetaceans (WCPFC8-2011-IP/01).
WCPFC8,347,"Australia presented a proposal for two a draft CMM’s protecting whale sharks and cetaceans from purse seine fishing operations (WCPFC8-2011-DP/15) noting that these interactions are of ongoing conservation concern and are beginning to draw criticism from international markets.  The proposals have two components:  a ban on intentional setting on whale sharks and cetaceans, and requirements for safe release of animals encircled unintentionally."
WCPFC8,348,FFA members supported Australia’s proposal stating that these animals are iconic and should not be intentionally set upon.  These CCMs noted that mortality occurs both in intentional and inadvertent sets.
WCPFC8,349,"The USA explained that it has domestic laws, enacted over two decades ago, which prohibit setting on live or dead cetaceans, but that whale shark issues have emerged more recently.  The USA strongly supported the CMMs for both animals but wished to provide some suggestions to the text."
WCPFC8,350,"Japan stated that it supported the spirit of the CMM to avoid injury or mortality to whale sharks and cetaceans.  However, Japan noted that there would be difficulties associated with enforcing the measure since it would be impossible to determine whether or not setting was intentional.  Japan referred WCPFC8 to its proposals for safe and live release of encircled cetaceans (WCPFC8-2011-DP/16) and whale sharks (WCPFC8-2011-DP/17) during purse seine operations."
WCPFC8,351,PNA members reminded WPCFC8 that there is an existing prohibition on setting purse seines on whale sharks and cetaceans in their EEZs.  These CCMs requested the Commission to extend this prohibition to the high seas and the remainder of the fishery.  The Third Implementing Arrangement reads: “ No purse seine vessel shall engage in fishing or related activity in order to catch tuna associated with whale sharks”
WCPFC8,352,FFA members thanked Japan for the safe release guidelines but requested more time to consult experts on these issues.  These CCMs also stated that release guidelines are not an alternative to the prohibition on intentional sets but they would be useful for unintentional encirclements.
WCPFC8,353,"Several CCMs supported the safe release guidelines but expressed concerns, similar to those of Japan, regarding the ability of purse seine vessels to detect these animals before setting when enforcing the measure."
WCPFC8,354,"While noting some potential difficulties for enforcement, several CCMs expressed support for both the proposed CMM and the safe release guidelines, noting that the latter could be taken as a starting point with amendments proposed as further technical information becomes available."
WCPFC8,355,"In response to some CCMs’ concerns about enforcing the measure, New Zealand suggested that the measure be supported by education and compliance efforts which would be facilitated by the requirement for 100% observer coverage.    43"
WCPFC8,356,"The USA informed WCPFC8 that it had many years of successful enforcement experience with its own law which bans sets on live or dead cetaceans.  The USA is conducting its own consultations on safe release guidelines but it is finding that there is little scientific information currently available.  The USA suggested that SC or TCC be tasked with developing a research programme, perhaps involving tagging, to evaluate and verify the effectiveness of preliminary safe release guidelines."
WCPFC8,357,Mexico stated its strong support for the proposal noting that intentional sets do occur and recommending the use of experience in other RFMOs when developing best practice release guidelines.
WCPFC8,358,French Polynesia informed WCPFC8 that these species are already protected in their waters.
WCPFC8,359,The Philippines noted that whale shark interactions are prohibited under Philippine law.
WCPFC8,360,Chinese Taipei noted that whale shark catches are prohibited in their waters.
WCPFC8,361,"Australia considered that the discussion reflected a consensus on the need to act.  It stated that the concerns about enforcement difficulties based on determining intention can be dealt with using observer reports.  Australia also recognized the need for crew safety and training, and agreed to resolve inconsistencies between the proposals for whale sharks and cetaceans."
WCPFC8,362,"After discussions in the margins, Australia circulated revised proposals for whale sharks (WCPFC8-2011-DP/15a (Rev 1)) and cetaceans (WCPFC8-2011-DP/15b (Rev 2))."
WCPFC8,363,"WPCFC8 adopted a Conservation and Management Measure to address the impact of purse seine fishing activity on cetaceans (WCPFC8-2011-DP/15b (Rev 2)).  (Attachment S, CMM 2011-03)"
WCPFC8,364,Japan stated that it could not support the measure for whale sharks without further consideration.
WCPFC8,365,Some CCMs expressed their disappointment that the measure for whale sharks was not adopted.
WCPFC8,366,"The Humane Society and Shark Advocates International stated their support for both the whale shark measure and the best practice safe release guidelines, noting mortalities to 75 whale sharks in two years, and the estimate that whale shark tourism generates $50 million annually.  They urged intersessional work toward adopting a measure at WCPFC9."
WCPFC8,367,"In considering the draft measure on protecting whale sharks from purse seine fishing operations, WCPFC8 noted ongoing work, through the Scientific Committee, on the development of best practice guidelines for release of encircled whale sharks.  Based on the current draft measure, the Commission agreed to finalise the measure at WCPFC9.        44 9.2.3 Implementation of the ROP for Fresh Fishing Vessels North of 20o N"
WCPFC8,368,The WCPFC Chair noted the recommendation from the Northern Committee to adopt a new CMM for implementation of the ROP for vessels fishing for fresh fish in Convention Area north of 20o North (see Agenda Item 7.1).
WCPFC8,369,"The USA referred to their proposal to consolidate proposed observer coverage levels based on CMM 2008-01 (WCPFC8-2011-DP/12) and explained that that their proposal presents a new version of the ROP CMM (currently CMM 2007-01) which contains the recommended text from the Northern Committee as Attachment K, Annex C."
WCPFC8,370,FFA members stated their support for implementation of the ROP for vessels fishing for fresh fish in the northern part of the Convention Area.  However these CCMs considered that the Northern Committee’s proposal appears to allow for vessels to carry observers from their own flag State and therefore is not consistent with the agreed ROP hybrid approach.  For this reason FFA members did not support the proposal.
WCPFC8,371,The USA reiterated their support for the Northern Committee proposal on the basis that the new text does not create any inconsistencies with existing requirements for observer sourcing.
WCPFC8,372,The WCPFC Chair referred the matter back to the Northern Committee for further discussion.   9.2.4 Implementation of an EEZ Entry and Exit Notification Scheme
WCPFC8,373,This item was discussed under Agenda Item 8.5.3.   9.2.5 Catch Documentation Scheme
WCPFC8,374,The Chair reminded WCPFC8 that the task before the Commission was to agree terms of reference for a working group on catch documentation schemes.  He referred WCPFC8 to papers on this subject prepared by the EU (WCPFC8-2011-DP/28 and WCPFC8-2011-DP/29) and FFA (WCPFC-2011-DP/04).
WCPFC8,375,"Papua New Guinea, Coordinator of the WCPFC CDS Working Group, presented draft terms of reference which incorporated comments from CCMs.  WCPFC8 was asked to endorse the TORs in order to allow the working group to hold a meeting and commence its work prior to TCC8."
WCPFC8,376,The EU noted that it had consulted with Papua New Guinea and others on the TOR but could not accept para. 3f which deals with the roles and responsibilities of different actors as currently drafted.  This is a question of consistency with the revision of Attachment A to the TOR.
WCPFC8,377,Some CCMs suggested that the EU concerns could be noted for the record but the CDS working group could still be formed and begin addressing this issue as well as all other issues relevant to development of a WCPFC CDS.
WCPFC8,378,The EU reiterated that it could not agree to the language in para. 3f.
WCPFC8,379,Papua New Guinea stated that it intended to maintain the text of its proposal as written. FFA members commented that they would go ahead and develop a regional CDS independently  45 of the Commission; that they welcomed the involvement of all members of the Commission in this process; and that they intend to hold a workshop in mid 2012 to progress a regionally agreed CDS.
WCPFC8,380,WCPFC8 agreed that the TOR for the CDS working group (WCPFC-2011-DP/20) be referred back to TCC8.   9.2.6 Oceanic Whitetip Shark
WCPFC8,381,"The USA presented its proposal for a CMM for oceanic whitetip sharks (WCPFC8-2011-DP/11 (Rev 2)).  Mr Keith Bigelow made a brief presentation highlighting the rationale for immediate action to protect this species including scientific findings of steep declining catch rates in multiple datasets from the WCPFC, the low probability that understanding of stock status will change with the results of stock assessments, and the fact that CMMs have been adopted for this species in two other RFMOs.  The USA explained that the proposed measure had been revised to incorporate comments from CCMs in the margins of WCPFC8 including a statement indicating that measure should not set a precedent for the management of other WCPO sharks, removal of the prohibition on selling, development of identification guides and training, allowance for biological sampling, and provisions for periodic review."
WCPFC8,382,"Several CCMs, including FFA members, stated their support for the proposal as an initial step toward developing a more comprehensive approach to shark management.  These CCMs considered that the existing scientific advice was a sufficient basis for action."
WCPFC8,383,"The EU expressed very strong support for this proposal, and noted that comments it had provided were incorporated. The EU reminded that the Convention text provides obligation for CCMs to take a precautionary approach."
WCPFC8,384,FFA members further noted the need to allow time and provide information to skippers and crew for implementation.
WCPFC8,385,Some CCMs also noted concerns that this measure could be seen as a precedent for the prohibition of retaining other species. These CCMs  preferred a more fundamental review of the shark CMM instead.
WCPFC8,386,"Shark Advocates International and Humane Society International stated that the proposal is consistent with the scientific advice and protections adopted by IATTC and ICCAT, and noted that a “no retention” policy could reduce oceanic whitetip mortality by up to 76%.  Their statement is appended as Attachment T."
WCPFC8,387,"Several CCMs, noting that similar measures have been adopted by IATTC and that their concerns had been addressed through revisions to the proposal by the USA, voiced their support for the proposal."
WCPFC8,388,"WCPFC8 adopted the CMM for oceanic whitetip sharks as presented in WCPFC8-2011-DP/11 (Rev 2).  (Attachment U, CMM 2011-04) 9.3 Review of CMMs 9.3.1 CMM 2009-03 Swordfish  46"
WCPFC8,389,The Chair reminded WCPFC8 that para. 11 of CMM 2009-03 requires the Commission to review the measure in 2011.  WCPFC8 was also invited to address the issue of conducting a stock assessment for swordfish.
WCPFC8,390,"CCMs noted that shortfalls in data provision by the EU which had impeded previous stock assessments have been remedied, and it is now possible to proceed with the stock assessment.  CCMs also noted that existing knowledge of the status of the stock is limited and this hampers review of the measure."
WCPFC8,391,The EU requested that the stock assessment proceed immediately with the results presented to SC8.
WCPFC8,392,"Several CCMs suggested that the time available before SC8 is insufficient to complete a thorough stock assessment with the new data, and this kind of rushed approach should not be undertaken."
WCPFC8,393,"In response to a question about whether it could deliver a swordfish stock assessment in time for SC8, the Scientific Services Provider (SPC) noted that undertaking such a stock assessment in addition to the four stock assessments currently underway will require identifying and contracting an additional stock assessment scientist for this work.  This process will take time and will reduce the already short period of time available to produce the assessment.  SPC nevertheless committed to commencing this work and presenting available, and perhaps interim, results to SC8 and to continuing the work post-SC8 as necessary.  The SPC further requested that sufficient budget be made available to undertake this additional work."
WCPFC8,394,WCPFC8 agreed that the Scientific Services Provider should begin work on the swordfish stock assessment and present available results to SC8.     9.3.2 CMM 2009-08 Charter Notification
WCPFC8,395,"The Chair invited WCPFC8 to consider the CMM on charter notification (CMM 2009-08) which is scheduled to expire in 2011.  He noted the close relationship between the charter notification measure and the issue of catch attribution which was examined in a recent Commission study (WCPFC8-2011/23).  The Secretariat’s summary of all notified charter vessels, as required by paras. 5 and 6 of CMM 2009-08 was provided as WCPFC8-2011/33 (Rev 1)."
WCPFC8,396,FFA members noted that they had prepared a paper containing a revised measure (WPCFC8-2011-DP/05) but had not been able to achieve consensus among all CCMs on the proposed text.  FFA members proposed deleting para. 8 of the existing measure (i.e. the expiry clause) and extending the remaining provisions of the existing measure for another year.
WCPFC8,397,"The USA, which also proposed a revised measure (WCPFC8-2011-DP/13), concurred with the FFA proposal."
WCPFC8,398,"The EU noted that it had worked with FFA to elaborate further their proposal and progress was achieved. Therefore a one year extension of the current measure seemed appropriate to allow finalisation of this work. The EU drew attention to the poor compliance to this measure, referring in particular to the annex to WCPFC8-2011/33 where the list of charter notification for 2011 did not correspond with information in Part 1 reports and with statements at WCPFC8. The EU considered that charter- related issues within WCPFC need to be reviewed jointly.   47"
WCPFC8,399,Other CCMs expressed support for the one-year extension and noted the importance of timely notification of chartering arrangements and resolving issues related to catch attribution.
WCPFC8,400,"WCPFC8 agreed to extend the CMM on charter notification (CMM 2009-08) to 31 December 2012.  (Attachment V, CMM 2011-05)"
WCPFC8,401,"Referring to the catch attribution study (WCPFC8-2011/23), the Executive Director suggested the study outputs be referred to TCC for further discussions on formulating recommendations for implementation."
WCPFC8,402,CCMs considered that the study results should be noted for future discussions by the Commission but not referred specifically to TCC for action.
WCPFC8,403,WCPFC8 noted the results of the catch attribution study.   9.3.3 CMM 2010-06 IUU (para 15 and 25)
WCPFC8,404,"Tonga presented a paper describing its efforts to ensure that coastal State satisfaction plays a major role in determining whether a vessel should or should not be placed on the IUU Vessel List (WCPFC8-2011-DP/21).  The paper presents guidelines used by the Cook Islands, New Zealand, Tokelau and Tonga when considering levels of sanctions applied in cases of IUU fishing."
WCPFC8,405,"Some CCMs, including the USA, stated that they hoped to continue dialogue on this issue intersessionally and at TCC8."
WCPFC8,406,One CCM questioned whether all of the criteria contained in the guidelines were adequately supported by international law.
WCPFC8,407,WCPFC8 agreed that the USA would lead an intersessional working group on this topic with the aim of bringing a proposal to TCC8.   9.3.4 CMM 2010-03 Compliance Monitoring Scheme
WCPFC8,408,Australia briefly introduced a review of CMM 2010-03 (WCPFC8-2011-DP/32) and proposed revisions to the text of the measure (WCPFC8-2011-DP/33 (Rev 1)).  It noted that discussion of its proposals for responses to non-compliance (WCPFC8-2011-DP/34) had been deferred to TCC8.
WCPFC8,409,"Several CCMs supported extension of the measure, as presented in WCPFC8-2011-DP/33 (Rev 1), for one year."
WCPFC8,410,One CCM requested that para. 11 (iii) be revised to read “identify technical assistance or capacity building needed to assist the CCM to address potential compliance issues”.
WCPFC8,411,"The Executive Director noted the workload associated with this CMM and asked CCMs to consider providing interns to the Commission during the processing period of developing draft CMRs, so that the Secretariat can ensure that the draft CMR reports are provided to CCMs within the required timeframes in the CMM.    48"
WCPFC8,412,"WCPFC8 adopted a revised CMM for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme based on WCPFC8-2011-DP/33 (Rev 1)) as modified by the amendment to para. 11 (iii) (Attachment W, CMM 2011-06).  9.3.5 CMM 2010-05 South Pacific Albacore"
WCPFC8,413,"FFA members expressed their disappointment that this item which is of importance to Pacific Island member countries was so late in the agenda, that it is now impossible to discuss and progress the issue."
WCPFC8,414,"FFA members presented a proposal to revise CMM 2010-05 to strengthen the limits on the number of vessels and include catch limits on the high seas (WCPFC8-2011-DP/03).  These CCMs highlighted the importance of the stock to domestic longline fisheries and their growing concern at the increasing catch and effort for this stock by some CCMs.  They recommended that the Commission take appropriate measures for high seas areas, and examine whether transhipment activities are in compliance with WCPFC CMMs."
WCPFC8,415,"Some CCMs suggested the proposed limits on vessels and catches required further discussion.  Particular issues raised included the link between the proposed limits and the status of the stock, the rationale for selection of the baseline periods, the appropriateness of placing limits on all gear types rather than only on the longline fishery, and the effectiveness of imposing limits only on the high seas."
WCPFC8,416,"In response to a question, FFA members clarified that the proposed catch limits for the high seas were designed to apply to South Pacific albacore throughout its range.  These CCMs noted that the measure already includes provisions to limit the fishery to historical levels but as it is considered that these provisions are not working effectively they should be tightened.  While work continues on comprehensive management for the whole stock and all gear types, the current proposal can be considered as an interim measure."
WCPFC8,417,"American Samoa, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna emphasized the importance of maintaining the stock at sustainable levels in order to sustain the economic benefits generated by their existing fisheries."
WCPFC8,418,"WWF, on behalf of Greenpeace and the Pew Environment Group, referred to their paper on this topic (WCPFC8-2011-OP/10), and stated that while the stock was not considered overfished nor was overfishing occurring, catches are rapidly approaching MSY and this creates concerns about impacts on sharks and seabirds.  These observers encouraged management efforts by Te Vaka Moana members and urged the Commission to support compatible measures.  This statement is appended as Attachment X."
WCPFC8,419,The Pacific Islands Tuna Industry Association (PITIA) supported the initiative by Te Vaka Moana members to strengthen management measures for the fishery and protect the interests of SIDS.
WCPFC8,420,The American Fishermen’s Research Foundation requested to be consulted in matters related to North and South Pacific albacore fisheries.     49
WCPFC8,421,Japan stated that it shares the concerns of previous speakers regarding the rapid increase of small longliners fishing in the area.  It noted that its trade statistics showed a large increase in imports of South Pacific albacore.
WCPFC8,422,Several CCMs appreciated the information on catch and transhipment by flag and by zone for South Pacific albacore provided by the Secretariat as WCPFC8-2011-IP/04 (Rev 1) and asked that this type of reporting be continued.
WCPFC8,423,WCPFC8 agreed that South Pacific albacore was a priority issue for WCPFC9. 9.3.6 Report by PNA members on the Vessel Day Scheme (VDS)
WCPFC8,424,"The PNA presented a report on the VDS (WCPFC8-2011-DP/23) showing that the total number of days fished was less than the adjusted total allowable effort of the scheme, excluding days fished under the FSM Arrangement and the US Treaty.  The PNA announced that although reports on the VDS have been provided to the Commission since 2007, this would be the last submission by the PNA as it considered it more appropriate for the scheme to be assessed through the WCPFC CMS."
WCPFC8,425,FFA members noted that the management of the fishery under the VDS is working well and seconded the PNA’s point that it was unfair to subject the VDS to greater scrutiny than other CCMs.
WCPFC8,426,The EU requested further information on the implementation of the VDS and how its limits are linked to scientific advice.  This could also be of interest to the SC. It could be useful for the WCPFC to receive such information as it may learn from the experience of the PNA in this regard.   AGENDA  ITEM  10  -  AD HOC TASK GROUP-DATA 10.1 Chartering State Data Access
WCPFC8,427,"The Commission had tasked the AHTG-Data to work intersessionally during 2011 on this matter. RMI submitted a proposal, and comments were received from EU and Chinese Taipei.TCC7 agreed to task the AHTG-Data with revisiting these issues in 2012 pending the outcome of discussions of the catch attribution study and the possible renewal of CMM 2009-08 by WCPFC8.  WCPFC8 noted the TCC7 recommendation.     AGENDA  ITEM  11  -  ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION 11.1 Cooperation with other Organizations"
WCPFC8,428,"The Executive Director presented a report on cooperation with other organizations (WCPFC8-2011/35) stating that the focus in the past year has been on issues related to IATTC including cross endorsement of observers and management of the overlap area.  Other cooperative activities have involved the SPC, the FFA, the PNA and visits to member countries."
WCPFC8,429, The Executive Director noted the outstanding item of the MOU with ISC and invited WCPFC8 to either refer the issue to the SC or to address it as part of follow-up activities pursuant to the Performance Review Panel recommendations.  WCPFC8 did not make any decision on the matter.  50  11.1.1 WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area
WCPFC8,430,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC8-2011/41 (Rev 1) on options for resolution of issues arising from the overlap area between WCPFC and IATTC.  The paper presents the history of the overlapping jurisdictions and shows that only 0.175% of the entire catch from the WCPFC and IATTC Convention areas is taken in the overlap area.  The options for management of the overlap area presented in the paper include:    i. Single organization management of the area ii. Management by gear type iii. Box the area and manage as a special management area iv. Application of measures from both Commissions with vessels flagged to a party that is a member of both Commissions subject to the measures of only one Commission, of that member’s choice v. Work toward harmonization of measures from both Commissions"
WCPFC8,431,"Dr Compeán (IATTC) provided additional information on the IATTC management system including limits on, inter alia, catch, fishing effort and capacity, observer requirements, prohibitions on discards and transhipments, and specifications of the tuna tracking system.  Dr Compeán noted that the Antigua Convention clearly states that it governs the overlap area, and given that many of the requirements are already included in national legislation, it would be very difficult to alter this."
WCPFC8,432,"Several Pacific Island countries and territories whose EEZs are near the overlap area emphasized the need to resolve the issues arising from the application of two sets of management measures, noting that IUU fishing incursions can be created by transiting through the overlap corridor.  These CCMs stated that the special requirements of SIDS should be recognized when considering management of the overlap area."
WCPFC8,433,"Some CCMs raised questions regarding how resolution of the issues would take account of catch attribution (and how this would relate to any applicable catch limits and financial contributions), and when two standards were in effect whether the higher or lower standard would prevail."
WCPFC8,434,"Some CCMs preferred Option iv stating that it appeared to be the easiest to implement but noted that it should be for the flag State, rather than the vessel, to decide which RFMO’s management system was applicable."
WCPFC8,435,"Other CCMs, while posing some questions about the need for each RFMO to adopt a set of exemptions for the gear type it would not regulate, preferred Option ii."
WCPFC8,436,"Several CCMs, preferred to continue to apply both RFMOs’ management systems, resolving conflicts as they arise on a case-by-case basis while working gradually toward a joint management system that would eliminate discrepancies and redundancies (Option v)."
WCPFC8,437,Some CCM’s suggested that a further option “Status quo” be added and evaluated as part of the ED discussions.     51
WCPFC8,438,The WCPFC Legal Advisor stated that Option iv could be implemented through adopting identical management measures for the overlap area in WCPFC and IATTC and then having these measures serve as the basis for domestic legislation for each CCM.
WCPFC8,439,"It was agreed that the two Executive Directors would elaborate, and consult among CCMs in the margins of the meeting, on Options ii and iv."
WCPFC8,440,"WCPFC8 agreed that this issue of the overlap area needed to be resolved as a matter of priority and asked the Chairs and Executive Directors of the two RFMOs to progress the issue, and report back to CCMs. 11.2 Future Work of the Commission"
WCPFC8,441,"WCPFC8 noted the Report of the Executive Director on the work of the Commission during 2011 (WCFPC8-2011/34), and the future work planned by the Secretariat.   AGENDA  ITEM  12  -  REPORT OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE 12.1 Budget Approval for 2012 and Indicative Budgets for 2013 and 2014"
WCPFC8,442,"Mr Charleston Deiye, Chairman of the FAC, presented the summary report of FAC5 (WCPFC8-2011-50 Rev3)."
WCPFC8,443,"The USA noted that the funding which offsets the full costs to WCPFC for data entry through 2014 (WCPFC8-2011-FAC5/12, para. 20) is provided through a generous contribution from New Caledonia and New Zealand for year 2012.  Subject to the availability of funds the current level of contribution from New Caledonia will continue through 2014."
WCPFC8,444,"WCPFC8 accepted the summary report and recommendations of FAC5, WCPFC8-2011-50 Rev3).  (Attachment Y) 12.2 Requirements for the Hosting of Meetings"
WCPFC8,445,"The Secretariat’s recommendations concerning requirements for hosting of meetings (WCPFC8-2011- FAC5/11) was noted by FAC5 (WCPFC8-2011- 50, para. 19).   AGENDA  ITEM  13  -  ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS 13.1 Election of Officers"
WCPFC8,446,"WCPFC8 accepted the nominations of the subsidiary bodies and confirmed Ms Rhea Moss-Christian of FSM as Chair of the TCC and Ludwig Kumoru of Papua New Guinea as Vice Chair of the SC.  WCPFC8 expressed its appreciation for the work of Mr Noan Pakop of Papua New Guinea, outgoing Chair of the TCC, and Ms Pamela Maru of the Cook Islands, outgoing Vice Chair of the SC.   13.2 Venues for Next Meetings"
WCPFC8,447,"WCPFC8 confirmed the following venues and dates for meetings in 2012:   a. SC8 will be held 7-15 August 2012 in Korea (location to be determined);  52 b. NC8 will be held 3-6 September 2012 in Nagasaki, Japan; c. TCC8 will be held 27 September – 3 October 2012 in Pohnpei, FSM; and d. Management Objectives Workshop will be held 29-30 November 2012 in Manila, the Philippines. e. WCPFC9 will be held 3-7 December 2012 in Manila, the Philippines. AGENDA  ITEM  14  -  OTHER MATTERS"
WCPFC8,448,FFA presented a proposal for the rationalisation of WCPFC related meetings (WCPFC8-2011-DP/48) which seeks a way to reduce meeting time and promote efficiency within the Commission.
WCPFC8,449,"WCPFC8 agreed that the Secretariat, in conjunction with the Chair, develop a discussion paper on this topic, drawing on WCPFC8-2011-DP/48 as well as experiences in other tuna RFMOs, for consideration by WCPFC9."
WCPFC8,450,"The USA, Japan and the EU introduced a paper on the management of purse seine capacity in the Convention Area (WCPFC8-2011-DP/52).  These CCMs acknowledged that there is overcapacity in the purse seine fishery and that this capacity must be reduced to a level which is commensurate with the long-term sustainability of the resource.  The paper contained proposals to limit the capacity of non-SIDS to existing levels, limit new capacity by non-SIDS to replacement of vessels which have left the WCPO, and limit new vessels of non-SIDS to the same or lower capacity than the vessels being replaced.  While recognising that more work will be necessary to develop a regional capacity management plan, these CCMs noted with interest the proposal by RMI to limit purse seine capacity to 220 vessels by 2020."
WCPFC8,451,Korea expressed its support for the proposal.
WCPFC8,452,"FFA members noted with regret that the proposal appears to defer discussions to a future point in time rather than taking immediate action as recommended by WCPFC8-2011-DP/39 (see Agenda Item 9.1.1).  FFA members also expressed disappointment that the WCPFC8-2011-DP/52 drafting group did not include representation from the Marshall Islands delegation, which had previously introduced a paper on the subject (WCPFC8-2011-DP/39) and that the drafting group did not appear to include a mechanism for capacity transfer to SIDS. There were fears that the proposal in WCPFC8-2011-DP/52 might act to freeze the current pattern of participation in the fishery."
WCPFC8,453,"The CCMs presenting the paper stated that while this proposal represented the first step, they looked forward to moving ahead with discussions as soon as possible."
WCPFC8,454,The representative of the American Fishermen’s Research Foundation made a statement (Attachment Z). AGENDA  ITEM  15  -  SUMMARY REPORT
WCPFC8,455,"A summary report was prepared by the rapporteur and the Secretariat, and circulated to CCMs for comment.    53 AGENDA  ITEM  16  -  CLOSE OF MEETING"

WCPFC9,46,The TCC Chair also noted several recommendations of TCC8 encouraging CNM applicants to provide their applications before the deadline in order to allow adequate time for review and for applicants to attend the TCC meeting.  TCC8 also noted the importance of reviewing the Provisional Compliance Monitoring Reports for recurring CNM applicants.
WCPFC9,47,"Several CCMs expressed concerns about the non-payment of assessed financial contributions from CNMs, late submission of applications and the fact that some CNM applicants did not attend TCC.  These CCMs requested that the Executive Director write to these CNMs to emphasize that although they have been granted CNM status for 2013 they are still expected to fulfil the obligations identified by the TCC8 review."
WCPFC9,48,One CCM suggested that a solution to these issues would be to encourage CNMs to become full members.  This would require that they pay their full contribution towards the cost of the Commission.    6
WCPFC9,49,WCPFC9 tasked the Executive Director with writing letters to the 2013 CNM applicants advising them of the outcomes of WCPFC9 and highlighting any outstanding obligations as discussed in paragraphs 14 – 47 (above)    Participatory Rights of CNMs (paragraph 12 of CMM 2009-11)
WCPFC9,50,"A Small Working Group (SWG), led by New Zealand, was convened to consider the issue of limits applying to the participatory rights for CNMs.  In particular, the SWG discussed issues relating to the linkage between CNM applications and the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS), the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area and the need to set catch limits in conformance with the requirements of the new CMM for tropical tunas (CMM 2012-01).  Report language was proposed in WCPFC9-2012-34."
WCPFC9,51,"In accordance with the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following limits apply to the participatory rights of Cooperating Non-Members (CNMs) for fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area.  General rules applying to all CNMs"

Such CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPF Convention and the WCPFC conservation and management measures.  In addition, CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV).  CCMs shall ensure that CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention.  Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will be conditional on full compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention.  CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the TCC."
WCPFC9,53,The CNMs identified below provide assurances that they will comply with all requests from Commission Members for information and documentation to investigate cases of possible illegal fishing.
WCPFC9,54,"With respect to the Compliance Monitoring Scheme, the Commission will consider how the Compliance Monitoring Reports of CNMs relate to the consideration of granting CNM status or determining participatory rights during the process of developing responses to non-compliance."
WCPFC9,55,The Commission advised CNMs to ensure that they meet the deadline for submission of applications for CNM status and meet all the obligations contained in CMM 2009-11.  The Commission noted that failure to meet the above requirements could prejudice the future granting or renewal of CNM status.  WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area
WCPFC9,56,"In accordance with the decision of WCPFC9 regarding the management of the overlap area south of 4˚S and between 130˚W and 150˚W, vessels flagged to Belize, Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico will be governed by the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area.  Accordingly, the  7 participatory rights for Belize, Ecuador, El Salvador and Mexico below apply to the WCPFC Convention Area excluding the overlap area."
WCPFC9,57,"In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area."
WCPFC9,58,"For the purpose of investigation of possible IUU fishing activities and consistent with international and domestic laws, vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area.  Limits applicable to individual CNM participatory rights  Belize"
WCPFC9,59,"WCPFC9 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Belize with the following participatory rights: Belize’s fishing activities in the Convention Area are limited to a longline bigeye catch of 803.25 t and a longline yellowfin catch of 2,000 t.

WCPFC9,65,"WCPFC9 encouraged Indonesia to apply compatible measures within its archipelagic waters given the significance of these waters for juvenile yellowfin and bigeye catch.  Indonesia noted that its participation in the Global Environment Facility (GEF) West Pacific East Asia Oceanic Fisheries Management (WPEA OFM) has assisted in improving data collection and Indonesia supports the extension of this project (WPEZ Phase II). Indonesia expressed its appreciation to the Commission for the decision to renew its CNM status and informed the Commission that its ratification of the Convention was in its final stage and Indonesia hopes to deposit its instrument of ratification in the first quarter of 2013.  Indonesia stated that, consistent with its position throughout the Multilateral High Level Conference (MHLC) and Preparatory Conference, it considers that WCPFC CMMs do not apply to archipelagic waters.  Mexico"
WCPFC9,66,"WCPFC9 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Mexico with the following participatory rights: The Commission noted that Mexico participated in the work of the Northern Committee (NC) at NC8 in 2012 and, noting the need for cooperation with the work of the NC particularly in regard to Pacific bluefin tuna (PBF), encouraged Mexico to continue to participate in the NC.  The Commission advised that future renewals of Mexico’s CNM status could be hampered if participation in the NC is not maintained.  Mexican participation in the WCPO tuna fisheries may not begin until all requested information and commitments have been provided to the WCPFC Secretariat in accordance with the Commission requirements.  The participatory rights of Mexico for fishing in the WCPFC Convention Area are limited to purse seine fishing only.  Mexico has no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area.  Panama"

The Commission notes the significant improvements in the collection and provision of data from Vietnam fisheries through the GEF WPEA project, administered by the WCPFC and encourages Vietnam to continue to cooperate with the Commission to improve the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data.  The participatory rights of Vietnam in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.    AGENDA  ITEM  3  -  EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CCM REPORTS 3.1 Report of the Executive Director on the work on the Commission and Cooperation with other Organizations"
WCPFC9,72,"The Executive Director introduced a summary of the Commission work for 2012 (WCPFC9-2012-11), noting the sad passing of Secretariat staffer Layleen Oliver early in the year and the fortuitous recruitment of Dr Lara Manarangi-Trott as Compliance Manager and Arlene Takesy.  The Secretariat’s work with the FAO on the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ) project was also highlighted."
WCPFC9,73,"The Executive Director reported on the Commission’s cooperation with other organizations (WCPFC9-2012-23), noting that the WCPFC Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with CCAMLR had expired."
WCPFC9,74,WCPFC9 endorsed the renewal of the WCPFC MOU with CCAMLR and tasked the Executive Director with progressing this issue.    10  3.1.1 IATTC/WCPFC Overlap Area Discussion Outcomes
WCPFC9,75,"On the specific topic of cooperation between WCPFC and IATTC on issues relating to the overlap area, the Chair provided a précis of the WCPFC8 paper on management options prepared by the Secretariats (WCPFC9-2012/IP-01) and a recent decision by IATTC on the basis of that paper (WCPFC9-2012-16 (rev1)).  The IATTC decision is aimed at providing a short-term, practical management arrangement which will be the subject of further discussion by a joint WCPFC-IATTC working group.  The IATTC decision is based upon a combination of Options 4 and 5 contained in the WCPFC8 paper (WCPFC9-2012/IP-01)."
WCPFC9,76,Some CCMs raised concerns regarding:  i) how VMS data from the overlap area would be made available;  ii) how high seas boarding and inspection (HSBI) procedures would be handled;  iii) the notification procedures and rules for those vessels which are able to choose between the two t-RFMOs; and iv) how to handle when only one of the t-RFMOs has measures on a certain topic and whether there should be default or minimum-standard measures.
WCPFC9,77,"Some CCMs pointed to the low amount of catch taken in the overlap area (0.175% of the entire catch from the WCPFC and IATTC Convention Areas), and suggested that while the issues associated with overlap area management itself do not constitute a high priority for either Commission overall, the issue of management compatibility between them does, and should be given attention through the proposed joint working group."
WCPFC9,78,"Some CCMs reiterated concerns regarding the application of catch limits to longline catch in the overlap area, and called for the establishment of Pacific-wide catch limits to cater for fleets which frequently shift between WCPFC and IATTC Convention Areas."
WCPFC9,79,It was suggested that this issue could be further discussed in conjunction with the proposal for the revised tropical tuna CMM (see Agenda Item 4).
WCPFC9,80,"WCPFC9 agreed to accept the short and long-term process in the Recommendation of the 84th extraordinary meeting of the IATTC regarding the management of the overlap area as set out in WCPFC9-2012-16 (rev 1),    a. In the short term, the following applies: i. Vessels listed exclusively in the WCPFC record of Fishing Vessels shall apply the conservation and management measures of the WCPFC when fishing in the overlap area; ii. Vessels listed exclusively in the IATTC register shall apply the conservation and management measures of the IATTC when fishing in the overlap area;  iii. In the case of vessels listed in the record/register of both organizations, the corresponding flag Member shall decide and notify to both Commissions under which of the two commissions those vessels shall operate when fishing in the overlap area, as regards the application, for a period of not less than three years, of the conservation and management measures of that Commission.   11 iv. In the case of vessels listed in the record/register of both organizations, the vessels of a Cooperating Non-Member shall apply the conservation and management measures of the Commission of which it is a member, when fishing in the overlap area.   b. Initiate in parallel a longer-term process through the establishment of a joint working group to explore avenues for managing tuna stocks in the entire Pacific Ocean, considering, inter alia, the joint management components outlined in Option 5 as set out in WCPFC9-2012/IP-01.   WCPFC further agreed  that the joint working group should also give consideration to the following matters to be incorporated into the short term process once available:  how VMS data from the overlap area would be made available; how high seas boarding and inspection procedures would be handled; the notification procedures and rules for those vessels which are able to choose between the two t-RFMOs; and how to handle when only one of the t-RFMOs has measures on a certain topic and whether there should be default or minimum-standard measures such as implementing joint requirements including for VMS, observers, and catch reports.    3.2 Annual Reports by CCMs"
WCPFC9,81,The Chair noted that CCM’s reports or statements to WCPFC9 under this agenda item will be appended to the WCPFC9 Summary Report.   3.3 Statements of Non-Members
WCPFC9,82,No statements were made by WCPFC CNMs.   3.4 Special Requirements of Developing States
WCPFC9,83,"Pacific Island small developing states presented WCPFC9-2012/DP-32 which requests that developed CCMs target their assistance to SIDS in the three areas of: i) increased commercialism of tuna fisheries and related industries; ii) enhanced capacity for conservation and management of fisheries by SIDS; and iii) broader cooperation on the importance of rights-based management.  Eleven specific needs and priorities were identified as follows:    a. Ensuring that in the revision of CMM 2008-01/CMM 2011-01 that there is no disproportionate burden of bigeye conservation on SIDS; b. Ensuring in the management of the fisheries for South Pacific albacore (ALB) and the revision of CMM 2008-01/CMM 2011-01, that CCMs contribute to increasing the participation of SIDS in the WCPO tuna fisheries; c. ensuring effective participation of SIDS in the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS) process so that SIDS are not marginalised including through improvements such as streamlining of the reporting obligations; d. ensuring SIDS are being assisted in the implementation of Commission obligations as required by the CMS, including through capacity-building, rather than using the scheme primarily to penalise SIDS; e. supporting the RMI “flick the switch” proposal to give access to in-zone VMS data, to assist all members to undertake monitoring and surveillance more effectively, and in particular this assists SIDS who have limited MCS tools; f. providing a budget for SIDS participation in the NC meeting;  12 g. ensuring that the Special Requirements Fund is not used to fund SIDS nationals to undertake core work of the Commission; h. ensuring that the proposed port states measure must clearly articulate assistance mechanisms that would support implementation by SIDS given that the implementation burden is placed disproportionately on port States many of which are SIDS; i. facilitating the use of the ROP Support Fund to assist SIDS in developing port sampling programs related to purse seine carrier transhipments; j. ensuring that priority for ROP funding be given to the national observer programmes of SIDS which are developing means of electronic collection of data; k. ensuring a rationalisation of Commission workloads, including a prioritisation of issues, and duly structuring and streamlining of agendas for all WCPFC-related meetings as this would allow a proper consideration of what the realistic options for meeting structures are as well as what works best for SIDS."
WCPFC9,84,"FFA members asked that each proposal brought before the Commission include a section analysing how the proposal responds to Article 30 of the Convention, and to Resolution 2008-01."
WCPFC9,85,"Kiribati informed the Commission that for 2013-2015 ten vessels will be added to the current Kiribati fleet of seven vessels.  Eight of the additional vessels will fish under joint venture arrangements, one vessel is transferring from another t-RFMO and one vessel is newly built and will be owned by Kiribati.  Although the fleet will expand to 17, fishing effort will continue to be managed under the Vessel Day Scheme.   3.4.1 CCM Reports on the Implementation of Article 30 of the Convention"
WCPFC9,86,"The USA referred to its cooperation on monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS), observer programmes and stock assessments.  The USA also noted the imminent finalization of the “broader cooperation” components of the ongoing negotiations for the multi-lateral purse seine treaty which addresses many of the same issues raised by Article 30 and Resolution 2008-01.  The USA reiterated its suggestion from TCC8 that SIDS CCMs consider a companion report of activities, including private sector investments which were, and were not, successful in helping to enhance capacity as well as suggestions on how specific activities could be made more successful."
WCPFC9,87,"The EU highlighted several aspects of their contributions and offered to provide a full report for the record.  Key areas mentioned were consideration of SIDS needs when drafting proposals for the Commission; numerous fisheries projects in the WCPO at regional and national level,  and trade actions to facilitate SIDS’s imports to the EU. (Attachment D) (EU report of Article 30)"
WCPFC9,88,"Japan enumerated several projects and activities amounting to nearly $500 million in the last five years including port development in Kiribati ($40M); a radio network in the Solomon Islands ($6M); a solar plant in FSM ($6M); a radio network in Tuvalu ($8M); and a hospital in Tonga ($23M).  Specifically under the theme of fisheries Japan contributed over $40M including a fish product transport road network in Kiribati; port development in Funafuti, Tuvalu; construction of markets/piers in PNG; and construction of a market in RMI.  In addition, hundreds of trainees have been trained, dozens of experts have been dispatched, and a large amount of funding has been provided (FFA Promotion Fund ($100M), Japan Trust Fund ($2.5M) and travel funding for the NC meeting)."
WCPFC9,89,"Chinese Taipei noted that it provides supports under two main themes:  MCS and fisheries development.  MCS assistance has included training of observers and other ROP support.   13 Fisheries development activities have included training, vessel construction and transfer, funding for SPC, and encouraging overseas investment."
WCPFC9,90,"Several SIDS who are CCMs acknowledged these contributions but requested more details, particularly in terms of how these projects and activities relate to the needs and priorities outlined in WCPFC9-2012/DP-32.  These CCMs requested that future reports by developed CCMs use the points in WCPFC9-2012/DP-32 as a yardstick for measuring their contributions.  Some SIDS who are CCMs stated they will also evaluate contributions against these points when deciding whether to support certain proposals to the Commission."
WCPFC9,91,One CCM suggested that there were compliance shortfalls by developed CCMs and this is not consistent with the spirit of Article 30.
WCPFC9,92,Nauru requested that the developed CCM statements be provided to them in writing.
WCPFC9,93,WCPFC9 noted the SIDS needs and priorities articulated in WCPFC9-2012/DP-32 and the developed CCM reports.    3.5 FAC Interim Report
WCPFC9,94,The WCPFC Chair explained that this agenda item was designed to provide for plenary discussion of the Commission’s financial contribution formula and the provision of funds for observers to attend Northern Committee meetings.
WCPFC9,95,"Niue thanked the Secretariat for preparing WCPFC9-2012-FAC6-10 (rev 1) which deals with alternative options for calculating the wealth component of the annual contribution for very small SIDS.  Noting that every person on Niue contributes $40 to the work of the Commission, Niue proposed that the Commission limit the wealth component of the annual contribution to no more than $1 per person."
WCPFC9,96,CCMs expressed support for Niue’s proposal but agreed to continue discussion of this issue within the FAC itself (see WCPFC9-2012-FAC6-10 (rev 1) and WCPFC9-2012-22).
WCPFC9,97,"The Executive Director (ED), referred to WCPFC9-2012-30 which details several options for funding participation of developing State CCMs in the meetings of the Northern Committee.  The options included the Commission funding:  i) the two SIDS NC members (Cook Islands and Vanuatu); ii) nine SIDS CCMs with EEZs north of the equator; and iii) all developing state CCMs.  The costs associated with these options were $18,000, $63,000 and $118,000, respectively.  The ED noted that upon establishment of the NC, it was agreed that the members of the NC would fully support its work."
WCPFC9,98,"FSM, RMI and Palau indicated their desire to participate on a regular basis in the meetings of the NC."
WCPFC9,99,"Several SIDS CCMs stated that they wished to see establishment of a standing arrangement for funding to support participation in the NC, and not to rely on the back-on-back scheduling of Japan’s consultation with FFA and the NC meeting."
WCPFC9,100,"Some SIDS CCMs, while fully supportive of greater SIDS participation, considered that it was not appropriate to use the Commission’s budget to fund this.  Some of these SIDS stated that  14 use of the Special Requirements Fund was also not appropriate, and expressed a preference for the members of the NC to fund developing State CCMs participation."
WCPFC9,101,The Chair of the NC indicated that the NC could consider options for funding developing State CCMs who wish to participate in the NC including NC members and non-members.
WCPFC9,102,"One developed CCM which is also a member of the NC, queried why the Commission’s Special Requirements Fund could not be used since under Article 30(3) participation in subsidiary bodies should be supported by the fund."
WCPFC9,103,"The WCPFC Legal Advisor explained that the NC was established on the understanding that it would run at its own cost.  Therefore, under a narrow interpretation of Article 30, the NC would bear the cost of SIDS participation."
WCPFC9,104,WCPFC9 accepted the offer by the NC to consider options for funding additional participation of developing State members and participating territories in the NC as observers.  This issue was referred to the FAC for further discussion (see WCPFC9-2012-22).    3.6 Selection of Chair of the Ad Hoc Task Group on Data (9.3.12)
WCPFC9,105,"The Chair invited WPCFC9 to consider appointing a Chair of the Ad Hoc Task Group (AHTG) – Data, in advance of full consideration of new chair appointments for subsidiary bodies, to allow work of the AHTG-Data to progress in the margins of WCPFC9."
WCPFC9,106,"FFA members expressed their appreciation to Holly Koehler (USA), former AHTG-Data Chair and nominated Ana Taholo (Tonga) to take up the position."
WCPFC9,107,WCPFC9 appointed Ana Taholo of Tonga as Chair of the AHTG-Data and endorsed her leadership of informal AHTG-Data meetings in the margins of WCPFC9.    AGENDA  ITEM  4  -  CMM 2012-01 (REPLACEMENT MEASURE FOR CMM 2008-01 / CMM 2011-01) 4.1 Stock Status of Key Tuna Species
WCPFC9,108,"Dr Shelton Harley of the WCPFC’s Scientific Services Provider, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), described the status of the main tuna stocks (see WCPFC9-2012-17).  It was noted that since some of the key stocks were last assessed in 2011, updated stock status information for 2012 is not available for all species."
WCPFC9,109,Overall the tuna catch in the WCPF Convention Area for 2011 was approximately 2.3 million t which represents the lowest catch since 2006.  Longline and pole and line fisheries’ catches were relatively stable but the observed decline was driven by lower catches of skipjack in the purse seine fishery.
WCPFC9,110,"In 2010 bigeye tuna (BET) catches were at their lowest level since 1996 due to reduced use of FADs and declines in the catches from other fleets.  Longline catches of BET increased only slightly in 2011, but catches of BET were greater in the purse seine fishery than in the longline  15 fishery for the first time.  The most recent BET stock assessment (2011, SC7) indicated that overfishing is occurring but the stock is not yet overfished."
WCPFC9,111,"Skipjack (SKJ) catches have declined from 1.8 million t to 1.7 million t to 1.55 million t over the past 3 years.  The most recent SKJ stock assessment (2011, SC7) indicates the stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring, however, the current catch of SKJ is higher than the MSY catch which means that stock size is gradually declining over time."
WCPFC9,112,"Catches of yellowfin tuna (YFT) were at their lowest level since 2002 primarily due to lower catches in the purse seine fishery.  Longline catches for this species are typically only a minor portion of the total catch (<20%).  Although the most recent stock assessment (2011, SC7) indicates the stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring, the trajectory of the Kobe plot is moving toward fully exploited status, and closer to overfishing and overfished quadrants, over time."
WCPFC9,113,"South Pacific albacore (ALB) catch levels were high in 2009-2010 with a slight dip in 2011.  However, across almost all fleets catch rates declined sharply in 2011.  This species was assessed this year (2012, SC8) and indicates the stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring.  The MSY catch was estimated to be approximately 100,000 t.  It is predicted that catch per unit effort by longliners fishing in EEZs will decline by 10-15% in the short term if catches remain at current levels.    4.2 Review of the Impact of CMM 2008-01/CMM 2011-01 and Implications of the New Measure"
WCPFC9,114,"Dr Harley also presented a summary of analyses previously presented at WCPFC8, SC8 and TCC8 on the impact of the recent tropical tuna CMMs (CMM 2008-01 and CMM 2011-01)."
WCPFC9,115,"Purse seine fishing effort has increased considerably since the introduction of CMM 2008-01.  Using logsheet and VMS datasets, most increases have occurred in EEZs and archipelagic waters.  Despite the overall trend of increasing fishing effort since 2009, there was no increase in 2012 relative to 2011."
WCPFC9,116,"Analyses of purse seine data are complicated by apparently anomalous conditions in 2010 when there was a very high proportion of free school sets and a very low proportion of FAD sets.  Catch rates in the last half of 2011 rates dropped to approximately 10 t per day which is only half or a third of typical catch rates.  Data for 2012 appears to indicate that this period of very low catch rates has ended.  Data for 2011-2012 have not been included in the stock assessment.  Observer records during the FAD closure period implemented by CMM 2008-01/CMM 2011-01 indicate some activities which are not consistent with free school fishing.  An analysis of catches during the FAD closure period shows that for 2009-2010 catches of SKJ showed a slight decline, YFT catches were stable, and BET catches declined considerably.  In 2011, all three species showed declines in catch during the FAD closure which represents a serious concern for those coastal States which are heavily dependent on FADs.  It is noted, however, that 2011 catches of SKJ and YFT showed declines both during and outside the FAD closure."
WCPFC9,117,"In terms of the longline fishery, by the time the tropical tuna management measures were first implemented (2009) longline catches of bigeye were already lower than the 2004 reference year and they continued to decline.  However, during this time effort has steadily increased.  Concurrently, the ALB component of the longline fishery is expanding and it is important to be able to separate the influence of that fishery from the fishery targeting BET.    16"
WCPFC9,118,"Other analysis of the components of the existing measures showed that if the CMM was implemented without exemptions approximately half of the estimated overfishing would be removed.  Comparisons were also made against different catch and effort levels of the major components of the fishery in 2004, 2009, and 2010.  Against a baseline of 2004, F/FMSY for BET currently stands at 1.57.  Against a baseline of 2009, F/FMSY currently stands at 1.39 with 32% of overfishing removed.  Against a baseline of 2010, F/FMSY currently stands at 0.97 with all overfishing removed. A total purse seine closure would result in little change in F/FMSY for BET compared to a FAD closure but would have a large impact on total tuna catches."
WCPFC9,119,"With regard to the Chair’s draft of the new measure (WCPFC9-2012-12), proposals for a four-month FAD closure with either current longline catch limits or a further 10% reduction for the major fleets were assessed.  Both proposals are considered to result in small improvements in stock status relative to stock status observed in 2011."
WCPFC9,120,"Some CCMs requested confirmation that the scientific advice presented here was the same as that presented to SC8, and that the SC8 recommendations still represented a valid basis for development of the new measure."
WCPFC9,121,The Chair confirmed this to be the case.
WCPFC9,122,FFA members encouraged WCPFC9 to focus on correcting the trend of stock depletion in SKJ and to do more to reduce overfishing of BET through managing all sectors of the fishery.
WCPFC9,123,One CCM noted that declining catch rate trends in the longline fishery may be due to changes in fleet dynamics (e.g. a shift in targeting from BET to YFT and ALB) and may not indicate a biomass decline in BET.  This CCM also questioned whether the increasing purse seine effort in EEZs is increasing the fishing mortality on juvenile BET and whether this might lead to local depletions.
WCPFC9,124,"SPC agreed with the need to consider fleet dynamics and targeting shifts but noted that its ability to do so was sometimes limited by the lack of operational data.  In response to the second point SPC noted that the number of FAD sets is a greater influence on the BET fishing mortality than the total purse seine effort per se, but that SEAPODYM modelling was planned to address these issues at SC9."
WCPFC9,125,Several CCMs reinforced the importance of provision of operational data in compliance with the Commission’s data rules.  Palau on behalf of the PNA  noted the particular need for high seas longline operational data to adequately understand the fishery and to aid in developing the longline VDS.
WCPFC9,126,"SPC confirmed that difficulties arise when using aggregate data as they do not allow easy partitioning of effort between EEZs and adjacent high seas.  Furthermore, aggregated hook numbers are not easily partitioned into numbers of days fishing--the proposed unit of effort for the PNA longline vessel days scheme."
WCPFC9,127,"The EU emphasized the importance of taking stronger management measures for tropical tunas,  and queried the following points:  a. What data are used to evaluate the number of FAD sets and are these data reliable?  17 b. Are both drifting and anchored FADs counted as FAD sets? c. What is the percentage of logsheets checked against observer reports?"
WCPFC9,128,"SPC replied that since most purse seine sets occur in EEZs, and these logsheets are received, there is very good operational logsheet data available for the purse seine fishery.  In addition, there is a high level of observer coverage in the purse seine fishery, and observer data both directly (i.e. through recording of set type) and indirectly (i.e. through species composition) provides reliable data on set type.  The gaps in operational data are mainly for the longline fishery on the high seas but sometimes these gaps can be overcome, e.g. by using VMS data.  In response to the question on definition of FAD sets, SPC clarified that natural logs, drifting FADs, and anchored FADs are included in the overall definition. SPC noted that the FAD closure was not implemented in archipelagic waters where almost all anchored FAD sets occur.  With regard to the percentage of logsheets checked against observer reports, SPC stated that this has been done at a global level for a sample of sets and has shown that the logsheets are generally accurate, but had not been done on a set by set basis."
WCPFC9,129,Nauru asked how some fleets were able to reduce their dependence on FAD sets; the level of understanding of the Indonesian and Philippines fleets’ operations; the level of compliance with the FAD closure; and if the level of overfishing in 2004 is worse than previously estimated how that affects the evaluation of CMM 2008-01.
WCPFC9,130,SPC suggested that the best information on how fleets reduced their dependence on FADs would be available from industry.  Data from Indonesia and Philippines fisheries have improved considerably as a result of the GEF WPEA OFM (West Pacific East Asia Oceanic Fisheries Management) project and are expected to continue to do so.  SPC committed to further analysis of FAD closure data and stated that analyses of the CMM are robust to changes in the baseline (relative) index.   4.3 Consideration of the Chairs Draft for CMM 2012-01
WCPFC9,131,"The WCPFC Chair introduced his draft of the new tropical tunas CMM (WCPFC9-2012-12) highlighting the following points:  a. Objectives section:  A decision was made to use the ratio of current fishing mortality to the fishing mortality at MSY (F/FMSY) as the objective for each species.  For SKJ and YFT the ratio was set as ≤ 1, i.e. constrain F to below MSY levels.  For BET the goal is to reach a ratio of 1.2 within 5 years and to reach ≤ 1 over a longer timeframe.  Catch limits are specified as placeholders and may change.  The adoption of target reference points will prompt the Commission to reconsider these objectives. b. Purse Seine High Seas section:  A high seas limit on purse seine days is specified as a total, and within that total a limit for the Philippines is set, based on data tables.  The need for a high seas purse seine VDS is acknowledged.  The scientific advice calls for a 5-6 month FAD closure but a 4-month closure is proposed here due to opposition to a longer closure.  Japan’s proposal to replace the closure with a limit on purse seine sets is attractive but will require more work to develop.   c. Purse Seine Catch Retention section:  Mahi mahi, rainbow runner, wahoo and billfish were added as options to consider because of the PNA intention to require catch retention of these species.  18 d. Longline Fisheries section:  there are two options for reducing longline catches of BET as there was no consensus on reducing catches by 10% as originally proposed.  e. Evaluation of Effectiveness section:  an annual review for three years is proposed and at an “appropriate time interval” thereafter.  The duration of the measure will need to be specified in para. 10.    The Chair noted that the reduction in the FAD closure period from six to four months would make it more difficult for the measure to reach its goals."
WCPFC9,132,"Japan asked how the Chair’s draft maintained consistency with scientific recommendations, especially as it appeared to have relaxed several components called for by the scientific advice."
WCPFC9,133,"The Chair explained that his draft was designed to present the strongest proposal that could be endorsed by the Commission.  As such, based on comments received at TCC8, it has relaxed some provisions that were not supported by CCMs."
WCPFC9,134,CCMs were invited to make general statements expressing their views on the priorities for development of the new measure.    General Statements
WCPFC9,135,"Korea stated that the initial objective for BET should be 1.0 rather than 1.2.  If FAD closure periods are included in the measure they would need to be well-monitored; a limit on FAD sets could be considered as an alternative.  Korea recognized the importance of developing a high seas VDS, including careful consideration of the number of fishing days allocated to the Philippines.  Korea noted that, with difficulty, it had already reduced its BET catches by 30% as of 2011."
WCPFC9,136,"PNA members commented that the Chair’s draft was fair and balanced and represents a good basis for the measure.  However, PNA members considered that strengthened management of the high seas was required including closure of the high seas pockets.  Furthermore, a fourth month of FAD closure would not be agreed unless compensation in the form of $500 per tonne of longline catch or alternative compensatory mechanism was paid.  PNA members drew attention to the potential need for zoned-based management for BET, e.g. protection of potential BET spawning areas in the eastern high seas.  Data provision shortfalls by other CCMs were noted and SC and TCC were requested to provide a paper to WCPFC10 on the implications for the Commission’s science, monitoring and compliance functions due to the ongoing failure by several major fleets to provide operational data."
WCPFC9,137,"FFA members also responded positively to the Chair’s draft but considered that the proposal requires stronger monitoring measures and needs to better consider the balance of costs and benefits to SIDS when providing an integrated package of measures.  They drew attention to the advice of the SC that additional measures are needed for bigeye conservation across all sectors of the fishery, and that limits need to be placed on fishing for skipjack. FFA members stated they are open to considering alternatives to a FAD closures and encouraged the development of new methods to reduce bycatch of juvenile BET in FAD sets.  Referring to WCPFC9-2012-DP/03, FFA members urged that steps to remedy data gaps and improve the flow of data for management purposes should be included in the measure, with particular priority on addressing the failures in the provision of operational data. .     19"
WCPFC9,138,"Japan thanked the Chair for a useful draft measure but raised the following points:  a. The objective for BET should be 1.0 within five years; b. Considering the special nature of the WCPO, it is time for real stakeholders such as SIDS, the Philippines and Indonesia to take leadership to develop more effective management measures; c. Japan’s fishing industry is already suffering from poor migration to its coast due to range contraction; high fuel prices and increasingly distant fishing grounds; and competition due to overcapacity; d. Japan has already reduced its longline BET catch by 50% and its purse seine BET catch by 30% and now it is time for others to take reductions; and e. In developing the new measure it is essential to follow the scientific advice.    Japan also noted that while some SIDS seemed to suggest that the Commission was interfering with their fisheries in national waters, fishing operations in national waters can have wider impacts on the stocks and can lead to reduced catches in the national waters of other CCMs."
WCPFC9,139,"The EU stated similar concerns to Japan with regard to the BET objective and the importance of working with SIDS to effectively control purse seine effort.  While noting that BET is the primary concern, the EU also acknowledged concerns with both SKJ and YFT stock status trajectories.  It stated that shortfalls in the provision of operational data must be remedied along with backlogs in observer data.  The EU continues to recommend a total closure period for the fishery (rather than a FAD closure) as it is concerned about the enforcement of a FAD closure. The EU is also concerned about the increase in fishing effort in archipelagic waters since 2004.  However, it stated it would support a FAD closure if properly monitored and enforced.  Further reductions in longline catches were advocated.  The EU also supports initiatives for FAD management plans, reference points and harvest control rules, and IMO numbers for fishing vessels."
WCPFC9,140,"Chinese Taipei also supported an objective for BET of 1.0 within five years and the need to manage fishing effort in the high seas pockets.  It advocated a FAD closure and FAD management plans but did not support a ban on night setting due to implementation difficulties.  Chinese Taipei believes that since longline catch of BET has already been reduced relative to 2001-2004, further reductions should not be required of the longline sector."
WCPFC9,141,Indonesia commented on the existence of tuna spawning areas in their waters and the importance of their efforts to manage fishing capacity in their national waters through limited entry and a national management plan.  Indonesia acknowledged the role of the GEF WPEA OFM project in helping to improve scientific knowledge and build management capacity.
WCPFC9,142,"The USA stated that it fully supports a technically sound and equitable measure but appreciates the difficulties inherent in reaching agreement on such a measure.  It supports an objective of F/FMSY=1.0 for BET but recognizes that time will be required to achieve this.  The USA advocated building on the experience gained through the implementation of CMM 2008-01, i.e. the longline catch limits were met but the purse seine effort limits and FAD closure were not complied with.  The USA expressed a preference for a total purse seine closure because of its relative ease of implementation, but indicated it could accept a FAD closure of adequate duration and appropriate enforcement.  An approach of implementing short-term goals while continuing to work toward longer-term goals was suggested.     20"
WCPFC9,143,The Philippines thanked the Chair for preparing the draft measure and highlighted the need to agree a management plan that can be effectively implemented throughout the region.
WCPFC9,144,"PNG on behalf of PNA countries, emphasized the importance of recognizing the sovereignty of Island States’ and the need to recognise their existing in-zone anchored FAD management plans and the obligation of other members in assisting with their development aspirations.  CCMs were encouraged to recognize the advanced management systems being put in place by the PNA and to focus on implementing compatible measures."
WCPFC9,145,"Greenpeace informed WCPFC9 that a recent cruise of the Esperanza conducted joint surveillance activities with the Government of Palau in the waters of High Seas Pocket #1 (HSP-1).  This cruise documented numerous illegal FADs in the waters of Palau and HSP-1, as well as illegal transhipment in HSP-1 involving vessels flagged to Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines.  Greenpeace urged the Commission to close HSP-1, to investigate the alleged violations by contacting the flag States involved, and to take appropriate actions under CMM 2010-06."
WCPFC9,146,"Indonesia responded that it had investigated the alleged incidents and found that the vessels in question were licensed and, according to VMS tracks, did not fish or tranship on the high seas."
WCPFC9,147,CCMs agreed to a first reading of the Chair’s draft to identify points of agreement for the production of a revised draft.    First Reading of the Chair’s Draft  - Preamble
WCPFC9,148,PNA members asked that the attachment containing the PNA Third Implementing Arrangement be deleted.
WCPFC9,149,One CCM questioned the meaning of “Noting” the PNA arrangements if those arrangements are not reported to the Commission.    - Objectives
WCPFC9,150,FFA members wished to make clear that the objectives will be replaced with target reference points once they are agreed by the Commission.
WCPFC9,151,One CCM questioned how the both the F/FMSY rate and the catch limit would be applied in the case that they each allow different levels of fishing.
WCPFC9,152,Some CCMs reiterated previous statements about the need to set the F/FMSY objective for BET at 1.0.    - Rules of General Application
WCPFC9,153,"Some CCMs considered that rules on chartering and catch and effort attribution are important but should be removed from this measure and dealt with separately, e.g. under the charter notification CMM 2011-05.     21"
WCPFC9,154,"Some CCMs found the sentence “For the purpose of the in-zone purse seine limits, all catch in the EEZ shall be attributed to the coastal State” (para. 5) confusing or unacceptable, and suggested that it be deleted or modified by replacing “catch” with “effort”."
WCPFC9,155,Some CCMs wanted a clearer specification about which areas needed to be protected from the transfer of effort.
WCPFC9,156,FFA members asked that “rights” be replaced with “rights and obligations”.
WCPFC9,157,Some CCMs stated that the applicability of the measure to the high seas and EEZs only should be clearly stated.
WCPFC9,158,"Other CCMs stated that such an explicit statement was unnecessary and might give the impression that other measures, without such an explicit statement, applies to other areas such as territorial seas, archipelagic waters and internal waters."
WCPFC9,159,Some CCMs favoured the measure remaining in force until otherwise agreed.
WCPFC9,160,Other CCMs believed it is inappropriate to specify a timeframe for the measure without first setting the management objectives and assessing how long it might take to achieve them.    -Purse Seine Fishery --Effort levels in EEZs
WCPFC9,161,Some CCMs did not support a cap on purse seine effort at 2010 levels as this level exceeds the 2004 effort limits specified in CMM 2008-01.
WCPFC9,162,"PNA Members explained that the use of 2004 base year data in CMM 2008-01 was a stopgap decision taken initially in 2005 to address bigeye bycatch before the FAD closure was developed.  Because it was a bigeye bycatch measure and not a skipjack measure, CMM 2008-01 allowed for purse seine growth in two ways.  Firstly it did not apply to SIDS domestic fleets and allowed for SIDs to develop their purse seine fisheries for skipjack.  Secondly, at the request of the EU in 2005, it allowed for obligations for access that had been entered into in 2005 but not taken up at that time, provided these were documented in agreements registered with the Commission.  The registered agreements included provision for future access for fleets from the EU, Korea, New Zealand and US fleets.  Therefore CMM 2005-01 and its predecessor CMM 2008-01 allowed for growth in purse seine fleets over the 2004 level in these ways."
WCPFC9,163,"PNA Members also noted that in the new CMM, the Chair is proposing a 2010 base year for PNA effort as a skipjack measure and without exemptions.  PNA Members considered this was completely consistent with the Scientific advice on skipjack where fishing mortality is less than half of MSY, and the use of a 2010 base year over most of the skipjack fishing grounds is in fact a highly precautionary approach."
WCPFC9,164,"Some CCM expressed a preference for absolute, rather than relative, effort limits, e.g. an actual number of purse seine fishing days, and called for monthly reporting of catch and effort against the limits.  These CCMs also considered that the purse seine effort limits for non-PNA members were too open ended and should be set with reference to CMM 2008-01 and in absolute terms.    22"
WCPFC9,165,Some CCMs supported the text on EEZ effort levels in the Chair’s draft as written.
WCPFC9,166,Some CCMs requested that reference to BET and YFT be removed from paras 11-12.
WCPFC9,167,"Some CCMs called for the addition of a paragraph which would place a limit on purse seine fishing in EEZs which are not subject to limits under the PNA VDS, i.e. “Other coastal States with effort in their EEZs exceeding 1000 days annually over the period 2006 to 2010 shall limit effort in their EEZs to 2001-2004 average or 2010 levels”."
WCPFC9,168,One CCM expressed a reservation about limiting purse seine effort in the northern part of the Convention Area.    --Effort levels in High Seas
WCPFC9,169,"Some CCMs queried how the allowable number of purse seine effort days on the high seas could be set.  Issues discussed, but not agreed, included i) this effort is not currently covered by the VDS; ii) the proposed limits should only be applicable to high seas areas between 20oS-20oN; iii) the high seas should remain open to fishing; iv) the Philippines’ fishing effort in HSP-1 needs to be verified; v) whether the limit should be “Olympic”, i.e. not allocated by flag or fleet; vi) whether the Commission should use the PNA definition of a fishing day; vii) how there could be an effective system for CCMs to report the number of fishing days expended; viii) how the Secretariat could verify CCMs’ reports of fishing days expended."
WCPFC9,170,Some CCMs specifically requested that the Philippines’ exemption be removed and the HSPs be closed on the grounds that the fishing effort there is uncontrolled; they are havens for IUU fishing; and their closure would increase the biomass in surrounding areas. These CCMs noted that the Philippines vessels weren’t fishing in the highseas adjacent to Philippines waters; they were anchoring FADs in the high seas areas which they can only get to by transiting across the zones of PNA members.
WCPFC9,171,These CCMs also noted that the PNA continues to prohibit fishing in the HSPs for their licensed vessels.
WCPFC9,172,Some CCMs noted that they supported the opening of HSP-1 to the Philippines to order to avoid the transfer of fishing effort into spawning and nursery areas.
WCPFC9,173,Some CCMs called for a management scheme to manage fishing effort in the HSPs specifically.
WCPFC9,174,The Philippines stated it is already aiming to control fishing activities in HSP-1 through a variety of management measures.  It noted that although 36 vessels were granted access to fish in HSP-1 only 11 have actually fished there.    --FAD Closure
WCPFC9,175,"FFA members noted that whilst PNA nations have imposed FAD closures and other conservation measures in their waters, to date there is no evidence of other CCMs applying compatible measures to their purse seine and Big eye longline fishing effort in WCP waters.   23"
WCPFC9,176,"Some CCMs explained that they are particularly sensitive to FAD closure proposals as they are fragile economies located in the most FAD-dependent areas.  Since fishing on free schools is estimated to be ~70% more costly to operate and may prompt industry to leave their fishing grounds, a FAD closure is a disproportionate burden on these CCMs.  Compensation should be provided for losses suffered thus far and for future losses associated with FAD closures.  In particular, a four-month FAD closure would only be agreed if compensation is provided."
WCPFC9,177,"The USA stated that if a FAD closure is adopted, in lieu of the FAD closure rules included in the measure, the US would continue using the FAD closure rules it issues via regulation in 2009, prior to the Commission’"
WCPFC9,178,Some CCMs agreed with the proposal for a four-month FAD closure but did not necessarily support compensation payments.
WCPFC9,179,"Some CCMs maintained that FAD closures are not effective and instead there should be a limit on FAD sets.  These CCMs, while noting that considerable work will be required to agree the details, supported this approach because it would incentivize free school fishing, implement catch limits, and increase the value of fishing days in EEZs."
WCPFC9,180,One CCM preferred a total closure of the fishery to a FAD closure for ease of monitoring.  This CCM was not convinced that a FAD closure is ineffective as it considered that any ineffectiveness observed to date may be the result of a lack of compliance rather than a lack of effectiveness of the measure.
WCPFC9,181,All CCMs who supported FAD closures insisted that they must be effectively enforced.  Issues discussed included:  a. Whether the rules for FAD closures contained in Attachment 3 of the Chair’s proposal (or other rules) should be adopted.   b. Whether night setting should be prohibited during the FAD closure  --Observers
WCPFC9,182,Some CCMs preferred to include provisions relating to observers in the CMM on the ROP rather than in this measure (see agenda item 9.4.3).
WCPFC9,183,Some CCMs asked that observer providers submit observer reports to both the Commission and the flag State.    --Additional Measures
WCPFC9,184,Some CCMs supported the text as written but suggested strengthening the language (i.e. remove “encouraged”) and removing the brackets.
WCPFC9,185,Some CCMs noted that as this clause is not binding it is of little practical use and should be removed.    --Catch Retention
WCPFC9,186,"Some CCMs did not support catch retention provisions as there is no clear conservation benefit and in fact, in some areas it could lead to undesirable competition with local fisheries.    24"
WCPFC9,187,Some CCMs questioned whether the requirements for catch retention were practical.
WCPFC9,188,"Some CCMs supported the catch retention requirements as written, including covering additional species, noting that they are compatible with PNA measures, create a disincentive for FAD sets, and will contribute to food security.    --FAD management plans"
WCPFC9,189,"One CCM emphasized the importance of FAD management plans with clear and uniform requirements that would apply to both the high seas and EEZs.  It did not support the proposed text because the requirements as drafted allow too much latitude.  Instead, this CCM advocated stronger requirements (see agenda item 10.1.4)."
WCPFC9,190,Some CCMs supported the requirement for FAD management plans as written.
WCPFC9,191,"Some CCMs stated that the FAD management plans under CMM 2008-01 were not effective because they were only applicable to the high seas and noted that coastal States are now developing their own requirements.  For these reasons, these CCMs would only support the FAD management plan text for an interim (e.g. three-year) period.  In addition, these CCMs requested the addition of para. 26 to clarify that FAD management plan requirements in national waters would take precedence.    -Longline Fishery"
WCPFC9,192,"Some CCMs supported the proposed BET catch limits for longline fleets on an interim basis but noted that the development of a longline VDS would prompt these levels to be revisited.  Some of these CCMs acknowledged that some longline fleets have already achieved the 30% reduction in catches required by CMM 2008-01, but those that haven’t should be prepared to take further reductions."
WCPFC9,193,Some CCMs stated that they could accept catch limits at the 2011 level but could not accept further reductions in BET catches.
WCPFC9,194,"Some CCMs questioned whether the catch data fairly reflected their historical catches, and did not agree to catch limits being imposed on this basis."
WCPFC9,195,One CCM noted that some catch in the South China Sea which is outside the Convention Area may have improperly been included in Attachment 5.
WCPFC9,196,Another CCM requested that Guam and CNMI be added to the catch tables attached to the measures..
WCPFC9,197,One CCM requested clarification on how the catch limits would be monitored.
WCPFC9,198,One CCM questioned why there should be catch limits for YFT in the longline fleets but not in the purse seine fleets.
WCPFC9,199,"Korea requested the following footnote be added to Attachment 5 of the Chair’s Draft:  “The Commission will consider that Korea’s BET catches will be counted against/within the  25 Pacific-wide limits, given that Korea has catch limits under both the WCPFC and IATTC and Korean longline vessels tend to frequently shift between the EPO and WCPO areas”.    -Other Commercial Fisheries"
WCPFC9,200,Some CCMs supported the text as written.
WCPFC9,201,Some CCMs suggested that capacity limits are not sufficient and limits on effort are required.
WCPFC9,202,One CCM suggested deleting the phrase “in future years”.    -Capacity Limitation
WCPFC9,203,Some CCMs noted that they had tabled a proposal to limit the purse seine fishing capacity of non-SIDS at previous Commission meetings (WCPFC9-2012-DP/30) but this was perhaps better handled as a separate measure rather than incorporated into this measure.
WCPFC9,204,Some CCMs supported the concept of capacity management but reminded the Commission that they are developing their own tools for achieving this; that longline capacity as well as purse seine capacity must be controlled; and that capacity limits must not obstruct domestic development.
WCPFC9,205,"Some CCMs stated that capacity limits should be applied in a balanced manner across all CCMs and that this issue requires further consideration.    -Evaluation of Effectiveness, Final Clause, Attachments"
WCPFC9,206,One CCM requested that if the map is to be attached to the measure that the map and footnotes used in CMM 2008-01 be used instead of the map from CMM 2011-01.
WCPFC9,207,"Having completed the first reading of the Chair’s draft, WCPFC9 discussed three options for progressing toward a new CMM for tropical tuna:  i) a new draft prepared by the Chair; ii) continued discussions in plenary; or iii) continued discussions in a SWG.  After some deliberation, WCPFC9 agreed to continue discussion via a SWG.    Discussion of Working Group Draft"
WCPFC9,208,"Masanori Miyahara, Chair of the SWG on the new tropical tuna measure (CMM 2012-01), reported back to the plenary on the revised draft measure produced by the SWG.  Key features of the measures were highlighted as follows:   a. The operational aspects of the measure will apply for 2013 only. b. There will be a three-month FAD closure with an additional reduction of either an additional month of FAD closure or control of the annual number of FAD sets to approximate a four-month FAD closure (with an exemption for SIDS’s small purse seiners);  c. There will be a prohibition on manual reporting, mandatory observer coverage and an increased VMS polling rate during the FAD closure period; d. There will be limits on longline catches similar to those proposed in the Chair’s draft, with a 10% reduction in BET catches by China and 2% voluntary reduction by Chinese Taipei and Korea;  26 e. A working group will be established to develop a draft multi-year management framework for 2014-2017 to be considered at TCC9 and WCPFC10.    The Chair of the SWG noted an error in WCPFC9-2012-35 which would be corrected by deleting para. 16 and adding a footnote to para. 15 containing a reference to Appendix D."
WCPFC9,209,WCPFC9 proceeded to review and edit the SWG proposal in plenary (WCPFC9-2012-35)
WCPFC9,210,"Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, PNG and China stated that in accordance with the relevant provisions of UNCLOS and UNFSA and Article 4 of the WCPF Convention, it is very clear that the Convention applies only to the high seas and EEZs in the Convention area but does not apply to territorial seas, archipelagic waters and internal waters, unless otherwise specified, such as measures for inspection at port.  Therefore, any reference to area of application such as “the measures is applied to EEZs and high seas” is not only unnecessary but also misleading since it may give a wrong impression that CMMs which do not have such references are applicable to areas other than EEZs or high seas.  It is the view of these CCMs that “this measure applies to all areas in the Convention Area unless otherwise specified” is sufficient and appropriate."
WCPFC9,211,The USA and EU noted that they do not share this view.
WCPFC9,212,"Some CCMs participating in the SWG clarified that the baseline for para. 15 (“not to increase fishing days on the high seas”) was left open, however, the intention is not increase effort over the range that is clearly on the record."
WCPFC9,213,PNG questioned how effort can be controlled without specification of the baseline.
WCPFC9,214,"With regard to WCPFC9-2012-35 para. 24 regarding the increase in VMS polling frequency during the FAD closure, WCPFC9 agreed that the increased costs, which are estimated to be on the order of $25,200, will be borne by the Commission."
WCPFC9,215,WCPFC9 adopted the tropical tuna management measure produced by the SWG and edited by the plenary as CMM 2012-01. (Attachment E)
WCPFC9,216,"Japan offered to host the working group to develop a draft of the multi-year management programme for 2014-2017 in Japan before TCC, and asked that TCC9 focus on this draft measure and compliance issues only."
WCPFC9,217,WCPFC9 agreed that Japan would host the work group meeting on the draft multi-year management programme for tropical tunas in Japan prior to TCC9.
WCPFC9,218,WCPFC9 agreed that TCC9 would focus on the draft multi-year management programme for tropical tunas and compliance issues.
WCPFC9,219,"An observer representing Greenpeace, the Pew Environment Group and WWF expressed disappointment that the Commission had once again focused on how much overfishing to allow rather than setting limits to manage stocks sustainably.  These groups considered that as the Commission continues to avoid addressing the core sustainable fisheries management issues, they will continue their efforts to transform the fisheries through markets and consumers."
WCPFC9,220,An observer representing the American Fishermen’s Research Foundation suggested that observers should be more constructive in their comments.    27
WCPFC9,221,"FFA members expressed their appreciation to the Chair and members of the SWG, and considered that the outcome represented a reasonable step forward.  However, these CCMs considered that the measure comes at the cost of SIDS for the benefits of developed fleets and consumers in developed countries and this contravenes the requirements of the Convention.  They noted that SIDS have in the past taken unilateral measures to protect their interests when the Commission has failed to do so, and although compensatory mechanisms have been proposed they have not been taken up.  While acknowledging the new measure, FFA members considered that it has not demonstrated a positive way forward.    AGENDA  ITEM  5  -  VMS ISSUES 5.1 Report of the VMS Small Working Group"
WCPFC9,222,"The Cook Islands presented the report of the VMS SWG on behalf of chairs Colin Brown (Cook Islands) and Stan Crothers (Tokelau) (WCPFC9-2012/WP-15).  This SWG was established by WCPFC8 based on a recommendation by TCC7.  The SWG prepared but could not reach agreement on a draft Purpose and Principles statement.  It was noted that this draft statement does not impose any obligations on CCMs but provides direction for future Commission decision-making.  The SWG also could not reach agreement on amendments to the VMS CMM and SSPs, but the most recent working drafts of these documents are provided for CCMs’ information.  All participants in the VMS SMG were thanked for their efforts."
WCPFC9,223,Some CCMs voiced their support for the draft Purpose and Principles document either as it stands in WCPFC9-2012-15 or with minor amendments.
WCPFC9,224,"Other CCMs, while acknowledging in principle that the draft Purpose and Principles Statement simply provides direction for future Commission decision-making, expressed concerns about suggestions that the VMS would transmit information other than vessel position data (e.g. catch and effort data).  These CCMs considered that such “fisheries information” (e.g. in the section entitled “Versatile”) requires checking before being used for analysis and that national programmes best fulfil this function."
WCPFC9,225,FFA members noted that they are developing a VMS that will transmit catch and effort data and CCMs will need to decide whether the WCPFC VMS will be compatible with the capabilities of that system.  FFA members also noted that part of the motivation for developing such capabilities was the shortfall in provision of catch and effort data to the Commission.
WCPFC9,226,New Zealand tabled a revised draft of the statement and several CCMs voiced their support for it.
WCPFC9,227,WCPFC9 adopted a statement describing the purpose and principles of the WCPFC VMS (WCPFC9-2012-15 (rev 1)). (Attachment F)  5.2 Annual VMS Report
WCPFC9,228,"The Executive Director presented the Secretariat’s Annual Report on the Commission’s VMS (WCPFC9-2012/IP-03).  He noted that the Secretariat’s approach of creating geo-fences around the Convention Area boundaries and not at EEZ-high seas boundaries was supported by TCC8 (WCPFC9-2012/IP-03, para. 19).  The Secretariat has yet to implement the  28 recommendation of TCC8 regarding implementation of an appropriate buffer zone around the Convention Area (TCC8 Report, para. 105).   5.3 Cost Rationalisation of VMS"
WCPFC9,229,"Mark Young (FFA) introduced a joint WCPFC-FFA Secretariat paper outlining three areas of potential cost savings:  a) integrate the FFA and WCPFC VMSs under one license while maintaining the firewall separation between the two systems; b) combine the infrastructure and airtime service contracts, which are currently separate, into one fully-managed service contract; c) strengthen the ALC type approval process to increase the number of transmissions that are received through single packet reporting which would provide a substantial savings over current double packet reporting (WCPFC9-2012/IP-08).  The paper estimates that over $150,000 in savings could be realized through this proposed cost rationalization."
WCPFC9,230,"Some CCMs, citing the critical need for cost savings and efficiency improvements, supported the cost rationalization as proposed."
WCPFC9,231,"Other CCMs, while supportive of cost savings, expressed doubts about the ability of an integrated system to maintain the necessary level of VMS data security.  Some of these CCMs also noted difficulties, in terms of ALC technician costs and scheduling, in adjusting ALCs to report under a single packet, or in a potential loss of information under single packet reporting."
WCPFC9,232,One CCM expressed interest in understanding whether the legal relationship between the Commission and the FFA would change as a result of the cost rationalization.
WCPFC9,233,"As these concerns could not be addressed during informal discussions in the margins of WCPFC9, further discussion of the VMS cost rationalization proposals was deferred, noting that the ED and the FFA would work intersessionally on the proposed cost savings and that he would provide an update on progress but that no changes would be made until after the matter was discussed at TCC9 and action decided at WCPFC10.    5.4 Article 24 “Flick the Switch”"
WCPFC9,234,"Alexa Cole (USA) presented a summary of the background to the “Flick the Switch” proposal for the application of the Commission VMS to the national waters of CCMs.  It was noted that all but three clauses of the proposal (4a, 4l and 4l (bis) (or d.i, d.xii and d.xii(bis) below)) were agreed as of TCC8, and work to resolve remaining issues was progressed intersessionally (WCPFC9-2012/DP-08)."
WCPFC9,235,"A majority of CCMs expressed support for the proposal as tabled, however, one CCM stated that it had further points which needed to be addressed."
WCPFC9,236,"An observer speaking on behalf of Greenpeace, Pew and WWF urged all CCMs to comply with the Commission’s VMS measures, and called for an integrated VMS capable of tracking vessels moving from the high seas into EEZs.  In encouraging support for the “Flick the Switch” proposal these observers noted that the recent Greenpeace ship tour had demonstrated the continuing presence of IUU fishing within the Convention Area."
WCPFC9,237,An SWG was convened in the margins of WCPFC9 and produced a revised draft proposal (WCPFC-2012/DP-08 (rev 1)).     29
WCPFC9,238,"WCPFC9 adopted the following paragraphs as decisions relating to the application of the Commission VMS solely to waters under the jurisdiction of Members and to complement and support Members’ national VMS, including compatibility:  a. Coastal States, particularly Small Island Developing States, have a legitimate and pressing need to increase their ability to monitor fishing vessels in waters under their national jurisdiction to ensure the effectiveness of measures adopted by the Commission or domestic laws or regulations of any Member are not undermined.  CCMs that are both SIDS and coastal States are some of the smallest developing nations in the world.  b. Flag States have a legitimate right to know when vessels flying their flag in the Convention Area are being monitored and must consent to that monitoring in the waters under the national jurisdiction of another Member.  CCMs consented to the monitoring of vessels flying their flag in the Convention Area at WCPFC7, pending resolution of an agreed upon template agreement.  CCMs have agreed to take the decisions captured in paragraph 4 below instead of creating a template agreement.  c. All Members have an interest in ensuring that vessels that are authorized to fish in the Convention Area do so in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, any conservation and management measures or decisions adopted by the Commission or domestic laws or regulations of any Member when operating in waters under its jurisdiction.  Effective conservation and management in waters under the jurisdiction of Members is critical to the success of the Commission as these areas are where the majority of catch and effort occurs in the Convention Area.  d. CCMs have agreed that rather than adopting a specific template agreement, as specified by WCPFC-2010-DP27 rev 1, the following principles will govern the application of the Commission VMS to the national waters of any Member that requests such application and the provision of those data (hereinafter “in-zone VMS data”) to Members:  i. Members that have existing national VMS programs may choose to have the Commission provide the in-zone VMS data for vessels reporting to the Commission VMS who enter waters under their national jurisdiction directly to their national VMS to ensure compatibility between national and high seas vessel monitoring systems.   ii. Vessels reporting to the Commission VMS that enter the waters under the national jurisdiction of a Member whose waters are included within the area covered by the Commission’s VMS retain all their navigational rights, including transit, innocent passage and freedom of navigation under international law.  Vessels in transit will not be subject to MCS activities based solely on the in-zone VMS data provided.  iii.  The in-zone VMS data will be provided only to Authorized MCS Personnel and Authorized Management Personnel, as defined in paragraphs 11 and 32, respectively, of the Commission’s 2009 Rules and Procedures or to FFA Secretariat on behalf of FFA Members, and to the WCPFC Secretariat.   30  iii(bis). These data will be used for further investigation if a violation of a conservation and management measure or national law of a coastal state by the relevant vessel is suspected.  CCMs will notify the Secretariat of the appropriate point of contact(s) to be used by flag States and coastal States for the purpose of any such investigation.  The Secretariat will maintain that list on the secure section of the Commission’s website.  iii(ter). The VMS data of any vessel that is under the status of manual reporting as described in the VMS SSPs shall be forward to the Authorized MCS Personnel and Authorized Management Personnel of the coastal Member in whose water a vessel is transiting.  iv. Members will use the in-zone VMS data only for (i) monitoring, control and surveillance purposes and for (ii) scientific purposes as described in paragraph 35 of the Commission Rules and Procedures for the Protection of, Access to and Dissemination of High Seas Non-Public Domain Data and Information Compiled by the Commission for the Purpose of Monitoring, Control or Surveillance (MCS) Activities and the Access to and Dissemination of High Seas VMS Data for Scientific Purposes, first adopted in 2009 (Commission’s 2009 Rules and Procedures).  v. Members shall maintain the confidentiality and security of the in-zone VMS data in a manner no less stringent than the security standards established by the Commission for the Secretariat in its Information Security Policy.  Failure to maintain the confidentiality and security of the VMS data in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph will result in suspending the flow of VMS data from WCPFC to the respective coastal State until the standards are met.  vi. Members will destroy any in-zone VMS data received for waters under its national jurisdiction within 15 days of receipt, unless such data are necessary for (i) an investigation or a judicial or administrative proceeding of an alleged violation of the provisions of the Convention, any conservation and management measures or decisions adopted by the Commission or domestic laws or regulations of the Member or (ii) a scientific purpose as described in paragraph 35 of the Commission’s 2009 Rules and Procedures.  Members will report on their compliance with this requirement in Part 2 of their Annual Report.  vii. Members may only share in-zone VMS data with intergovernmental regional fisheries bodies and the Flag State to answer a specific and precise request for MCS purposes and with the Authorized MCS Entities and Personnel, as defined in paragraph 11 of the Commission’s 2009 Rules and Procedures, of other Members for the purpose of conducting MCS activities.  The in-zone VMS data will be shared in a manner consistent with Members’ national VMS SSPs and the WCPFC rules and procedures, and in accordance with the confidentiality and retention and destruction requirements established herein.  31   viii. Members will be responsible for any additional costs associated with the application of the Commission’s VMS to waters under their national jurisdiction, as determined by the Executive Director.   However, this issue will be revisited in the event that there is any change to the cost and payment structure of the Commission’s VMS.  Failure to make timely payment of the additional costs, if any, identified by the Executive Director will result in a suspension of the provision of in-zone data until payment is made.  ix. Waters under a Member’s national jurisdiction will be included within the area covered by the Commission’s VMS only at that Member’s request and Members are not obligated to request such inclusion.  x. Upon receipt of a request by a Member pursuant to subparagraph i, the Executive Director shall immediately notify Members of the Commission of the request by circular.  The waters under the national jurisdiction of the Member making a request under subparagraph i shall be included within the area covered by the Commission’s VMS 30 days after the date of that circular.  xi. The Executive Director shall establish and maintain a list on the Commission’s website of all the Members whose waters are included in the Commission’s VMS.  xii. In the event that two or more Members have conflicting claimed EEZ geographical coordinates, such area will not be included within the area covered by the Commission VMS and, therefore, the VMS data for such area will only be provided to any of those Members with the agreement of all of those Members.  If any of those Members objects to the provision of VMS data in such area, none of those Members will be provided such data.   xii(bis). No Member may object to the provision of in-zone VMS data in areas not associated with its own claimed EEZ. In the event that any Member has objected to another Member’s claimed EEZ geographical coordinates, no Member will be provided in-zone VMS data in the area until and unless the Members have reached an agreement to include the area within the area covered by the Commission’s VMS.  xiii. The implementation of these decisions shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Convention including Article 3(2) of the Convention.  xiv. The implementation of and compliance with these decisions will be subject to review under the existing and any future Compliance Monitoring Scheme.  xv. These decisions will be effective 60 days after the Commission meeting and shall only allow for the provision of data generated from that date forward.  These decisions will be reviewed or revised in two years.  During this period, CCMs will consider additional technical solutions to address concerns of illegal fishing occurring in waters.   32"
WCPFC9,239,CCMs thanked the USA for their leadership in developing the proposal and facilitating its adoption.    5.5 VMS Manual Reporting
WCPFC9,240,"New Zealand introduced two recommendations from TCC8 regarding VMS manual reporting procedures in the event of ALC/MTU malfunctioning.  The first recommendation concerns adoption of a standard format for manual reporting (TCC8 Summary Report, para. 119).  It was noted that in parallel with this recommendation, the Secretariat was asked to report to TCC9 on the manual reports received with specific regard to whether certain models of ALC/MTU units and/or particular vessels are failing more often than others.  The second recommendation contains interim proposals for the required intervals of manual reporting and the length of time the vessel can continue to operate while reporting manually (TCC8 Summary Report, para. 120).  While there has been considerable debate about these timeframes over the years, and there are still outstanding issues, TCC8 agreed to recommend interim requirements that would apply for a one-year period."
WCPFC9,241,"FFA members stated that while the interim proposal falls short of their expectations, they would support it for a one-year period.  In addition to reinforcing the need for the Secretariat to report to TCC9 on manual reports received, FFA members asked that the manual reports be linked to the Vessel Tracking Agreement Forms (VTAFs) and the Record of Fishing Vessels (RFVs) and that manual reporting be included as a standing item in the VMS Annual Reports prepared by the Secretariat."
WCPFC9,242,Some CCMs supported the interim proposal and asked how the linkage requested by FFA could be accomplished.
WCPFC9,243,The Secretariat indicated that the proposed enhancements for integrating VMS data into the WCPFC IMS was intended to respond in part to this request (see WCPFC9-2012-FAC16).
WCPFC9,244,"Some CCMs, while not objecting to the specific content of the interim proposal, stated that imposing manual reporting requirements for only one year (and then perhaps changing them) represented an unacceptable administrative burden."
WCPFC9,245,"WCPFC9 adopted i) the amendments to the VMS Standards Specification and Procedures (SSPs) recommended in para. 120 of the TCC8 Summary Report for the period 1 March 2013 to 1 March 2014 (Attachment G), and ii) the standard manual reporting format recommended para. 119 of the TCC8 Summary Report.  (Attachment H)    AGENDA  ITEM  6  -  IUU VESSEL LISTING FOR 2013 6.1 Proposed IUU Vessel List for 2013"
WCPFC9,246,"The TCC Chair informed WCPFC9 that there are no vessels proposed for the Provisional Vessel List for 2013 (WCPFC9-2012-20).  With regard to the WCPFC IUU Vessel List, on the basis of confirmation in writing from both FSM and Chinese Taipei that a settlement has been reached on the incident involving the Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1, TCC8 recommended that this vessel be removed from the list.  There has been no further information received regarding the Neptune,  33 Fu Lien No. 1 and Yu Fong 168 since WCPFC8 and thus TCC8 recommended that these three vessels remain on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC9,247,FFA members supported the removal of the Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List on the basis that both the requirements of CMM 2010-06 and satisfaction of the coastal State have been achieved.  FFA members supported the retention of the other three vessels on the list.
WCPFC9,248,"Chinese Taipei thanked CCMs for supporting the removal of the Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 from the list, noting that the vessel’s license to fish on the high seas has been revoked for several years already."
WCPFC9,249,WCPFC9 agreed to remove the Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC9,250,"WCPFC9 agreed that the Neptune, the Fu Lien No. 1, and the Yu Fong 168 would remain on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.  The WCPFC IUU list for 2013 is provided at (Attachment I).  AGENDA  ITEM  7  -  SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE 7.1 Report of the Eighth Session of the Scientific Committee"
WCPFC9,251,"Ludwig Kumoru, Vice-Chair of the SC presented the report of SC8 to WCPFC9 (WCPFC9-2012-17) for Chairman Miyabe, in the form of a summary of recommendations (WCPFC9-2012-28).  He noted that financial considerations related to SC activities are discussed within the FAC (see agenda item 12)."
WCPFC9,252,"SPC supplemented its earlier presentation on the status of the key tuna stocks (see agenda item 4.1) with additional information on Southwest Pacific striped marlin (MLS), sharks and swordfish (SWO):  a. An assessment of Southwest Pacific striped marlin (MLS) was conducted in 2012.  MSY catch was estimated at just over 2000 t and while the stock is overfished, overfishing is not occurring (SC8 Summary Report, Section 4.6.2).   b. Assessments of oceanic whitetip and silky sharks were also conducted in 2012.  The oceanic whitetip shark assessment shows that the stock is overfished and overfishing is occurring.  The silky shark assessment was not accepted by SC8 due to concerns over data conflict and potential biases, but basic fishery indicators show declines in recent years.  An update of the silky shark assessment is slightly more optimistic than the SC8 assessment but still strongly suggests overfishing is occurring (WCPFC9-2012/IP-13).   c. Progress with the swordfish (SWO) assessment since SC8 has included a collaborative analysis of tagging data which defined a new spatial structure for the model; and catch, effort and biological data preparation.  Further collaboration with EU scientists is suggested to facilitate and strengthen the assessment (WCPFC9-2012/IP-10)."
WCPFC9,253,The EU stated it has provided operational data for SWO and is willing to collaborate with SPC on its analysis through electronic means to produce an assessment for review at SC9.    34
WCPFC9,254,FFA members welcomed this collaboration on SWO and looked forward to hearing the results at SC9.
WCPFC9,255,"In response to para. 223 of the SC8 Summary Report, Dr Gerard DiNardo, Chair of the ISC, presented an update on North Pacific striped marlin involving additional stock assessment projections (WCPFC9-2012-IP/18).  The new projections assessed a new type of recruitment pattern (“recent”) based on low recruitment observed in 2004-2008 and some alternative harvest scenarios (constant Fx% and constant catch).  The performance measure was the spawning stock biomass in the final year of the projection 2017 relative to the current level.  The results showed that if fishing mortality levels are maintained there is <25% probability that the biomass will decline.  If recruitment is low or F is increased the results are more pessimistic; if F is reduced the stock will rebuild.  Constant catches of <2,500 t appear to be sustainable based a 50% risk level.  Dr DiNardo noted that catches have declined in 2010-2011 and a large recruitment pulse was observed in 2009.  These results will be further discussed at the next ISC Plenary meeting in July 2013."
WCPFC9,256,"FFA members reminded the ISC that all stock assessment should be submitted to the SC in the same way that other assessments are.  The FFA noted the use of peer reviews, and reiterated a suggestion from SC8 that an ISC assessment also be identified for a comprehensive peer review, similar to bigeye this year."
WCPFC9,257,"Dr DiNardo responded that according to the terms of the MOU between WCPFC and ISC, all ISC reports, including stock assessment reports, shall be provided to WCPFC-SC..  It was pointed out that the ISC has always complied with this requirement. Having said that, the ISC is taking measures to accommodate the request for faster reporting. Regarding peer reviews, it was pointed out that ISC routinely conducts peer reviews of its assessments using the Center for Independent Experts (CIE) and that reviews are currently underway for North Pacific striped marlin stock assessment and planned for Pacific bluefin tuna (PBF) stock assessment."
WCPFC9,258,"The SC Vice-Chair and the WCPFC Chair highlighted the following SC recommendations for WCPFC9 adoption:    a. Amend “Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission” as recommended (SC8 Summary Report para. 71 c-e); b. Assist with funding for distributing/harmonizing shark identification guides (SC8 Summary Report, para 392); c. Encourage CCMs to use longline logsheets showing key shark species (SC8 Summary Report, para. 393); d. List the whale shark as a key shark species (SC8 Summary Report, para. 395); e. Approve budget items for Project 60 ($75,000); BET Multifan-CL improvements ($40,000); and stock assessment improvements ($160,000) (SC8 Summary Report, para. 469) (note:  financial aspects to be considered by the FAC); f. Extend the Shark Research Programme beyond December 2013 (SC8 Summary Report, para. 474) (note:  financial aspects to be considered by the FAC); g. Include budgets for Project 58 (Evaluation of Reference Points and Decision Rules) and Project 66 (Identification and Evaluation of Target Reference Points) in the SC work programme and budget (SC8 Summary Report, para. 475);  35 h. Task the Northern Committee to conduct a scientific peer review of the PBF stock assessment (SC8 Summary Report, para. 484); and invited WCPFC9 to comment on these and other issues raised by SC8."
WCPFC9,259,"Several CCMs raised concerns about the continued non-provision of operational data, particularly as the importance of these data was highlighted by the BET peer review.  These CCMs recalled the recommendation of WCPFC7 (WCPFC7 Summary Report, para. 173) that CCMs that have issues in providing accurate and complete data in a timely manner should provide a draft plan of how impediments to the provision of data will be dealt with as rapidly as possible, but noted that no such plans have been received.  It was suggested that data improvement plans be included in the CMR process."
WCPFC9,260,One CCM stated that it meets its data provision obligations by allowing SPC scientists to analyse the data onsite.
WCPFC9,261,Some CCMs considered that such arrangements do not constitute data provision under the rules of the Commission.
WCPFC9,262,"With regard to recommendations concerning BET assessments, SPC clarified that the $40,000 for BET Multifan-CL improvements is for one year only but the $160,000 for stock assessment improvements is required for each year."
WCPFC9,263,Several CCMs supported the proposed Pacific-wide BET stock assessment.
WCPFC9,264,SPC explained that the first step will be to improve the assessment software and key data inputs.  There will be an updated WCPO BET assessment in 2014 and a Pacific-wide BET assessment in 2015.
WCPFC9,265,"Several CCMs reiterated their concerns regarding South Pacific ALB, in particular the time lag between when the data are collected, the assessment is completed and the management measures are implemented.  These CCMs encouraged prompt action to protect the South Pacific ALB stock."
WCPFC9,266,"In response to a question from a CCM about how much fishing mortality on South Pacific ALB needs to be reduced to achieve economically viable catch rates, SPC noted that this requires an economic rather than scientific analysis."
WCPFC9,267,Some CCMs supported continued work on target and limit reference points as reflected in para. 298 of the SC8 Summary Report (i.e. biomass-based reference points).
WCPFC9,268,"Other CCMs noted that this paragraph does not represent the consensus view of SC8 and asked that the views expressed in para. 299 of the SC8 Summary Report also be reflected.  In particular, these CCMs wish to see both biomass-based and F-based reference points considered.  These CCMs cited several advantages with F-based reference points including: i) biomass estimate updates require new stock assessments; ii) F levels are more directly controlled by management; and iii) F-based reference points are more robust to biological uncertainties."
WCPFC9,269,WCPFC9 adopted paragraph 298 of the SC8 Summary Report and noted that SC will continue further work on F-based reference points for discussion at SC9.     36
WCPFC9,270,"WCPFC9 adopted SC8 recommendations concerning amending the Commission’s data provision requirements (SC8 Summary Report, para. 71 c-e); shark identification guides (SC8 Summary Report, para 392); use of longline logsheets showing key shark species (SC8 Summary Report, para. 393); listing the whale shark as a key shark species (SC8 Summary Report, para. 395); approving Project 60, BET Multifan-CL improvements, and stock assessment improvements; extending the Shark Research Programme (SC8 Summary Report, para. 474); approving Projects 58 and 66; and conducting a scientific peer review of the PBF stock assessment (SC8 Summary Report, para. 484).  (Attachment J)"
WCPFC9,271,WCPFC9 adopted the SC8 Report with no objection.   7.2 Best Science Proposal
WCPFC9,272,"The EU introduced its proposal for a resolution on the best available science (WCPFC9-2012/DP-28 (rev 1)).  The proposal, which has been put forward in several other RFMOs, outlines actions necessary to preserve and promote the independence and excellence of the scientific providers, improve communication between managers and scientists, enhance data collection, facilitate new research projects and build scientific capacity in SIDS.  The proposal specifically calls for the drafting of i) a code of conduct and ii) a strategic plan for the SC, the WCPFC SSP and the ISC."
WCPFC9,273,Several CCMs articulated strong support for the proposal agreeing that good science is the foundation of the work of the Commission.
WCPFC9,274,One CCM considered that the SC should be tasked with reviewing the resolution specifically with reference to the linkages between the SC and the ISC on data and scientific advice.
WCPFC9,275,WCPFC9 adopted the resolution on best available science (WCPFC9-2012/DP-28 (rev 1)) as Resolution 2012-01. (Attachment K)   AGENDA  ITEM  8  -  NORTHERN COMMITTEE 8.1 Report of the Eighth Regular Session of the Northern Committee
WCPFC9,276,"Masanori Miyahara, Chair of the Northern Committee, gave a presentation on the recent work of the NC and the issues that concern it.  NC8 met in Nagasaki, Japan from 3-6 September 2012 and primarily focused on issues relating to the CMM for Pacific BFT which expires at the end of 2012 (CMM 2010-04).  According to this CMM, total fishing effort for 2010 and 2011 should remain below 2002-2004 levels except for artisanal fisheries.  All CCMs except for Korea are required to reduce catches of juveniles (age 0-3) below the 2002-2004 levels.  The largest fisheries for PBF are Japanese and Japan has implemented catch limits for PBF and completed registration of its artisanal fleet of over 13,000 vessels.  It has also prohibited any increase in PBF farming capacity because most of the fry are wild-caught.  Korea has deferred management measures until after its ongoing PBF research programme is complete.  Chinese Taipei longline fleets catch adult PBF but catches have declined recently.  Mexico caught over 6600 t of PBF in 2012 which exceeds its limit under CMM 2010-04 of 5600 t.  Although an updated PBF stock  37 assessment is being finalised by ISC, the results are not yet available, and it is proposed to continue the current PBF CMM with the addition of a requirement to monitor the international trade in PBF products (WCPFC-2012-25).  NC8 also agreed a proposal to implement the ROP for vessels fishing for fresh fish north of 20oN no later than 31 December 2014 (WCPFC9-2012-26) and announced that all members are prepared to implement VMS in the area north of 20oN and west of 175oE by 31 December 2013 (WCPFC9-2012-18)."
WCPFC9,277,Some CCMs raised concerns about the implementation date for the ROP and stated that further delays would not be acceptable.
WCPFC9,278,Chinese Taipei explained that it is encountering difficulties placing observers on small longliners due to safety issues and crew conditions.  Nevertheless Chinese Taipei will continue to strive to increase observer coverage.
WCPFC9,279,Some CCMs noted that the applicability of the observer coverage levels to small longliners remains unclear because of a lack of definitions of key terms under the ROP.  It was noted that this issue arises not only in the NC but in the ROP as a whole.
WCPFC9,280,"The Chair of the NC stated that it was not the role of the NC to discuss definitions in the ROP.  Therefore, the proposal for implementation of the ROP in the NC area remains as presented in WCPFC-2012-26."
WCPFC9,281,"Several CCMs, as well as observers representing WWF, Pew and Greenpeace, emphasizing the importance of reducing fishing mortality on juvenile PBF, looked forward to the results of the PBF stock assessment and to strengthening the CMM next year."
WCPFC9,282,"WWF, Pew and Greenpeace called for ISC to increase its transparency by re-considering requests for observer status at its meetings."
WCPFC9,283,Indonesia noted the importance of artificial propagation of tuna fry and announced it would shortly be sharing results of some research on YFT.
WCPFC9,284,"Canada highlighted the considerable progress made by the NC and the ISC on North Pacific ALB including improvements in catch and effort reporting, development of precautionary management frameworks, and work programme planning."
WCPFC9,285,WCPFC9 endorsed the NC members commitment to implement VMS in the area north of 20oN and west of 175oE by 31 December 2013.    AGENDA  ITEM  9  -  TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE 9.1 Report of the Eighth Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee
WCPFC9,286,"The TCC Chair presented the report of TCC8 (WCPFC9-2012-19) noting the issues of cooperating non-members (CNMs) and the WCPFC IUU Vessel List are discussed under agenda items 2.3 and 6, respectively.  Paper WCPFC9-2012-29 was noted as a reference document which links TCC8 recommendations to WCPFC9 agenda items.  Other issues considered by TCC8 are discussed under agenda items 5 (VMS) and 10 (CMMs).     38 9.2 Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures 9.2.1 Report on Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS) Provisional CMR and Executive Summary"
WCPFC9,287,"The TCC Chair presented the Provisional Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR) and Executive Summary (WCPFC9-2012-07).  This report is based on work conducted by a TCC8 SWG, chaired by Shuya Nakatsuka (Japan) and Ana Taholo (Tonga), which reviewed draft and full CMR summaries for each CCM prepared by the Secretariat.  Compliance was evaluated in five CMR categories (catch and effort limits; catch and effort reporting; spatial and temporal closures and restriction on the use of FADS; observer and VMS coverage; and provision of scientific data through AR Part 1 and scientific data to be provided to the Commission).  One of three compliance ratings was assigned (implemented, not applicable, potential implementation issues).  Four CCMs could not be assessed due to lack of submitted information.  The Provisional CMR and Executive Summary produced by the TCC8 SWG contains some recommendations for the CMS and is forwarded to WCPFC9 for consideration and adoption."
WCPFC9,288,"FFA members requested that additional information be added to the Final CMR to address i) more serious instances of non-compliance; ii) non-compliance of data gaps by a mechanism external to the CMS; and iii) broadening the scope of the CMS to include compliance with the eastern high seas pocket and transhipment measures (CMMs 2009-06 and 2010-02) (WCPFC-2012-DP/06).  With regard to serious instances of non-compliance, FFA members stated that a compliance status of “Compliance Review” was not appropriate, rather “Compliance Action Plan” or “Compliance Remedy” was warranted to correct continuing non-compliances."
WCPFC9,289,Edits were made to the 2011 CMR’s Executive Summary to address FFA’s point regarding serious instances of non-compliance.
WCPFC9,290,"FFA members also stated that all sensitive information should be removed from the CMR before it is released to the public, i.e. that all CCM-specific references should be removed.  In addition, FFA members requested that a footnote be added to make clear that the CMS is an interim process and that the results from this process should not be considered as an assessed compliance level until that process is finalized.  Furthermore, FFA members stressed that all CCMs must adhere to the Commission’s data rules on non-public data when handling the information in the CMRs."
WCPFC9,291,All summaries of draft CMR reports for individual CCMs were deleted from the 2011 CMR and a sentence was added to the 2011 CMR’s Executive Summary to define the appropriate use of CMR information.
WCPFC9,292,"WCPFC9 agrees that until such time as the Compliance Monitoring Scheme becomes a permanent measure, the compliance status of any CCM or information regarding compliance developed through the Compliance Monitoring Scheme shall only be used consistent with paragraphs 1 and 6 in CMM 2011-06 and to support the continued development and refinement of the CMS and will not be used by CCMs for any outside purpose."
WCPFC9,293,WCPFC9 adopted the Final Compliance Monitoring Report for 2011. (Attachment L)
WCPFC9,294,"With regard to extension of the CMS for 2012, Japan tabled a revised CMM which added provisions for i) AR Part 2 information to be evaluated, and ii) CMMs that are managed under a  39 multilateral framework be evaluated separately based on a report of their implementation prepared by the Secretariat based on available information (WCPFC-2012-DP/34)."
WCPFC9,295,There was not consensus on this proposal as some CCMs indicated they are already struggling to meet their AR Part 2 reporting requirements and as a result have requested further streamlining of reporting requirements be undertaken as a matter of priority.
WCPFC9,296,"WCPFC9 agreed to extend the CMS as specified in CMM 2011-06 for an additional year (2013) and to hold further discussions on potential refinements to the scheme intersessionally and at TCC9 with a view to adopting a revised CMS at WCPFC10. (Attachment M and CMM 2012-02)  Revised Annual Report Part 2 Template, including Online Interface, and Proposed Addendum to Annual Report Part 1and other TCC issues."
WCPFC9,297,"The TCC Chair introduced TCC recommendations relating to the CMS process, namely CCM reporting requirements, templates and deadlines (TCC Summary Report, paras. 212-214 and 222); the establishment of an Assistant Compliance Manager position within the Secretariat (TCC Summary Report, paras. 223); and development of information management systems to facilitate reporting (TCC Summary Report, paras. 224) (WCPFC9-2012-29)."
WCPFC9,298,"Rather than adopting the TCC recommendations concerning AR Parts 1 and 2 reporting (TCC Summary Report paras. 212-213), FFA members recommended that a consultant be tasked in early 2013 with examining how the reporting requirements can be streamlined.  The goal of the consultancy would be to facilitate SIDS’ ability to comply with the reporting requirements but avoid burdens associated with repetitive or unnecessary data elements (WCPFC9-2012-DP/06).  These CCMs considered that such a consultancy was a higher priority than development of the Information Management System (IMS) or the establishment of the Assistant Compliance Manager, both of which could proceed based on the results of the consultancy."
WCPFC9,299,"Some CCMs, while concurring with the need to streamline reporting requirements and avoid undue burdens on small administrations, considered that a consultancy was unnecessary as useful streamlining ideas have already been identified.  These CCMs also noted that the ongoing development of the IMS, and the creation of an Assistant Compliance Manager position, are designed to lighten CCMs reporting burdens."
WCPFC9,300,"Some CCM supported the creation of a working group which would meet in advance of TCC9 to assist in preparing the draft and summary CMRs and thus alleviate the workload of the TCC.  This working group would be open to all CCMs on a voluntary basis and would primarily focus on preparing the summary CMRs after the Secretariat had prepared the draft CMRs and sent them to CCMs for review.  However, if AR Parts 1 and 2 are submitted late, this working group could also assist with preparing the (full) draft CMRs."
WCPFC9,301,"The Executive Director stated that the most time-consuming task is preparation of the draft CMRs but that if the AR Parts 1 and 2 are submitted on time, if the Assistant Compliance Manager position is approved, and if interns are available to assist as in previous years, the workload would be manageable.  He noted that there would be funding implications associated with the proposal for the working group meeting which had not yet been considered by the FAC.  He also noted that the terms of reference and funding for the proposed consultancy had not been specified or agreed.     40"
WCPFC9,302,The Chair suggested that these issues could be further discussed at TCC9.
WCPFC9,303,"WCPFC9 adopted TCC recommendations concerning compliance monitoring reporting and processing of reported information (TCC Summary Report, paras. 212-214 and 222-224). (the text of the TCC8 recommendation is included in Attachment N )   9.3 TCC8 Summary Report Recommendations"
WCPFC9,304,"The TCC Chair explained that several TCCs recommendations to WCPFC9 are discussed under other agenda items including IUU vessel listing procedures (see agenda item 10.1), VMS issues (see agenda item 5), charter notification issues (see agenda item 10.1) and appointment of the Chair AHTG-Data (see agenda item 3.6).  CCMs were invited to comment on TCC recommendations pertaining to the ROP-TAG (TCC Summary Report para. 151), ROP data entry (TCC Summary Report para. 169 & 189), IMS and electronic data priorities (TCC Summary Report para. 184-185), the register of non-CCM carriers and bunkers (TCC Summary Report para. 330), the New Zealand application for transhipment at sea (TCC Summary Report para. 346), the eastern high seas pocket (TCC Summary Report para. 372-373), the active vessel list  Summary Report(WCPFC9-2012-IP06 rev 1) ALC/MTU audit template (TCC Summary Report para. 137, 142-143) and South Pacific ALB.    ROP Data Entry"
WCPFC9,305,"FFA members expressed support for the relocation of data entry staff from the SPC Pohnpei office to the WCPFC office.  However, FFA members noted that data entry functions should over time shift from being handled by regional service providers to being handled by the national observer programmes."
WCPFC9,306,The EU supported the relocation of data entry staff on the condition that there would be no additional cost to the Commission.
WCPFC9,307,WCPFC9 adopted TCC8 recommendations contained in paras. 169 & 189 of the TCC8 Summary Report concerning ROP data entry.  (the text of the TCC8 recommendation is included in Attachment N )  Information Management System
WCPFC9,308,"FFA members welcomed the implementation of electronic solutions for improved data management, but reiterated the need to ensure the migration of capacity from the regional to the national level over time.  In addition, the importance of demonstrating the effectiveness of new technology before reducing funding for existing systems was emphasized."
WCPFC9,309,The EU also supported the IMS and continued assistance to SIDS for programmes such as debriefer training and observer data management.
WCPFC9,310,WCPFC9 adopted TCC8 recommendations contained in paras. 184-185 of the TCC8 Summary Report concerning the Commission’s Information Management System.  (the text of the TCC8 recommendation is included in Attachment N )  Eastern High Seas Pocket (E-HSP) Compliance and Resourcing   41
WCPFC9,311,"Several CCMs, including FFA and Te Vaka Moana members, thanked the Cook Islands and the Secretariat for their analyses of compliance with CMM 2010-02 (WCPFC9-2012-IP/16 and WCPFC9-2010-IP/17).  These CCMs noted that these papers documented a startling degree of non-compliance with the measure including gaps in manual reporting and application of VMS, and a lack of correspondence in the data available from each.  This was considered by two CCMs with EEZs adjacent to the E-HSP (Cook Islands and French Polynesia) to represent a serious threat of IUU fishing activities in their national waters.  Some CCMs thus called for careful monitoring of compliance data (including continued analysis by the Secretariat), timely action by CCMs with regard to vessels found to be non-compliant (e.g. reporting back to the Commission within 60 days), and, unless the situation improves markedly, the E-HSP to be closed when the measure is next reviewed."
WCPFC9,312,Fiji supported closure of the E-HSP with an exemption for vessels flagged to CCMs with adjacent EEZs.
WCPFC9,313,Kiribati did not support closure of the E-HSP based on concerns that it would drive IUU fishing activities into their EEZ.  Kiribati also noted that it reserved its position on issues related to the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area which could impinge on its national sovereignty.
WCPFC9,314,Other CCMs stated they did not support closure but were willing to consider ways of improving the management of the E-HSP.
WCPFC9,315,"China informed the Commission that a High Seas Boarding and Inspection conducted by France in the E-HSP found the Rong Da Yang 7 in violation of the 5% shark fins to carcass ratio in CMM 2010-07.  China stated it would withdraw Rong Da Yang 7’s license and remove it from the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (RFV) for six months, as well as call it back to port in northern China.  China will provide details of these penalties to the WCPFC in writing."
WCPFC9,316,WCPFC9 adopted TCC8 recommendations contained in paras. 372-373 of the TCC8 Summary Report concerning the eastern high seas pocket.  (the text of the TCC8 recommendation is included in Attachment N )  Register of Non-CCM Carriers and Bunkers
WCPFC9,317,One CCM stated that it was opposed to the TCC8 recommendation to extend the WCPFC Interim Register of Carriers and Bunkers to 30 June 2013.
WCPFC9,318,"The WCPFC Legal Advisor explained that CMM 2009-01, which provides for an Interim Register of carriers and bunker flagged to non-CCMs, would expire 60 days after the close of WCPFC9 unless otherwise decided.  Upon expiry of the register, carriers and bunkers flagged to non-CCMs would not be allowed to operate in the WCPF Convention Area.  However, these vessels could continue to operate if they re-flagged to CCMs."
WCPFC9,319,Some CCMs supported the extension in the TCC8 recommendation in order to avoid disruption and economic impacts to the fishery.
WCPFC9,320,The CCM which had stated its opposition to the extension withdrew its objection.
WCPFC9,321,"WCPFC9 adopted TCC8 recommendations contained in para 330 of the TCC Summary Report concerning extension of the WCPFC Interim Register of Carriers and  42 Bunkers to 30 June 2013.  (the text of the TCC8 recommendation is included in Attachment N )  New Zealand Transshipment at sea exemption  310. WCPFC9 adopted TCC8 recommendations contained in paras. 346 of the TCC8 Summary Report concerning the New Zealand request under CMM 2009-06 for an exemption for its purse seine vessels to tranship at sea.  (the text of the TCC8 recommendation is included in Attachment N )  ALC/MTU Audit format  310. WCPFC9 adopted TCC8 recommendations contained in paras. 137, 142-143 of the TCC8 Summary Report concerning ALC/MTU Audit format.  (the text of the TCC8 recommendation is included in Attachment N )   Active Vessel List"
WCPFC9,322,"The EU thanked the Secretariat for providing a list of vessels that were reported by CCMs to have fished in 2011 (WCPFC9-2012-IP-09) and articulated its interest in continuing the work of the USA on standards, specifications and procedures (SSPs) the Record of Fishing Vessels including as they relate to minimum required data fields.."
WCPFC9,323,The USA appreciated the support expressed by the EU and expressed agreement with a previous intervention that including IMO numbers in the RFV for vessels that have them would be a good step towards establishing unique vessel identifiers for all fishing vessels operating under this Convention. The US also suggested that the Commission could immediately take the step of requiring that all vessels that are eligible for IMO numbers obtain them. The USA suggested that this and related ideas could be discussed at the next TCC meeting..    South Pacific Albacore
WCPFC9,324,"Several CCMs, including FFA and TVM members, urged the Commission to move toward stronger control of the South Pacific ALB fishery through a combination of measures including vessel/effort limits, catch limits based first on biological reference points and later on economic reference points, national allocations to allow rights-based management, and a compatible and consistent management approach to both EEZ and high seas fishing grounds.  These CCMs noted the high reliance of some of the most vulnerable SIDS on this fishery and the importance of taking action before the stock reached critical levels.  Overcapacity in high seas areas, dynamic targeting switching, and recent declines in the market price for ALB were cited as examples of a need to manage the fishery to maximize long-term economic benefits to SIDS.  These CCMs noted that while a specific proposal could not be tabled for WCPFC9 they would work toward strengthening the existing measure (CMM 2010-05) through discussions at TCC9 and produce a new proposal for WCPFC10."
WCPFC9,325,"Some CCMs proposed that WCPFC9 set a total allowable catch (TAC) of 99,000 t for the entire Convention area including the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area."
WCPFC9,326,Other CCMs did not support the setting of a TAC.     43
WCPFC9,327,"One CCM stated that it considered the catch and effort patterns in the fishery to be quite stable, and thus there is time available to further discuss options for managing this fishery."
WCPFC9,328,"One CCM asked that the paper prepared by the Secretariat (WCPFC9-2012-IP/07) be updated for SC9, TCC9 and WCPFC10 to show i) by fleet the number of longline vessels actively fishing south of the equator separated as follows 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30+, annually from 2000 to 2012; ii) the tuna species proportions for each longline fleet in these areas; and iii) the seasonal distribution of the longline effort for each fleet south of the equator using Commission VMS data."
WCPFC9,329,An observer representing the American Fisherman’s Research Foundation expressed concerns about expansion of the longline fishery but stated there is no scientific basis for limiting the troll fishery under a comprehensive management measure for South Pacific ALB.
WCPFC9,330,"Observers representing WWF and Greenpeace urged the Commission to swiftly adopt a plan for effectively managing the South Pacific ALB fishery as proposed by FFA and TVM members. A statement by Tonga (on behalf of Te Vaka Moana Participants: Cook Islands, New Zealand, Niue, Samoa, Tokelau and Tonga) is attached (Attachment O)  9.4 Regional Observer Programme 9.4.1 Annual Regional Observer Programme Report"
WCPFC9,331,WPCFC9 noted the Annual Report of the ROP presented in WCPFC9-2012/IP-02.
WCPFC9,332,"In noting the report and thanking the Secretariat and the USA for the ROP audits, FFA members made the following points:  a. Any requests for letters of indemnity should be directed to the observer providers and the national observer programmes; b. The observer trip monitoring summary in Table 2 of the Annual Report of the ROP should be disaggregated by fleet for next year’s report; c. More work is needed before the requirements for transiting without an observer can be agreed; d. Flag States should respond to reported incidents of violence against observers and provide compensation or insurance for medical costs arising from such incidents."
WCPFC9,333,Some CCMs queried why observer reports from their vessels were taking so long to reach SPC and why these reports once received by SPC were not provided to the flag States upon request.
WCPFC9,334,SPC noted that there are lags in their receipt of observer data from national observer programmes but that these are decreasing with time.
WCPFC9,335,The Chair noted the provision of observer data to vessel operators/captains and flag States will be discussed under agenda item 9.4.5.
WCPFC9,336,The Commission confirmed the recommendation from TCC8 and extended the ROP TAG until March 2014. (the text of the TCC8 recommendation is included in Attachment N ) 9.4.2 WCPFC-IATTC Cross Endorsement of Observers  44
WCPFC9,337,There were no issues discussed by WCPFC9 under this topic.  9.4.3 Observer Proposal (USA)
WCPFC9,338,"The USA presented WCPFC9-2012-DP/19 containing a proposal to revise the ROP (CMM 2007-01) to incorporate new requirements pertaining to observers north of 20oN, observers on transiting vessels, and more robust requirements for debriefing.  Having taken comments on the proposal in the margins of WCPFC9, the USA decided to withdraw the proposal and suggested that the ideas in the proposal be considered in the Chair’s working draft of the tropical tuna measure.   9.4.4 Observer Proposal (Northern Committee)"
WCPFC9,339,"The Chair of the NC reiterated that NC8 recommended that (WCPFC9-2012-26):    “The ROP for fishing vessels used exclusively to fish for fresh fish in the area north of 20 degrees north shall be implemented in the following manner:   i. No later than 31 December 2014, CCMs shall commence implementation of observer programmes for fishing vessels used to fish for fresh fish beyond the national jurisdictions in the area north of 20 degrees north.  ii. For such fishing vessels, CCMs shall achieve 5% coverage of the effort of each fishery fishing for fresh fish by the end of December 2014.  iii. Observers shall be sourced from the WCPFC ROP."
WCPFC9,340,WCPFC9 adopted the recommendation of NC8 on implementation of the ROP for vessels used exclusively to fish for fresh fish in the area north of 20o N. (Attachment P) 9.4.5 Access to Observer Reports by Captains
WCPFC9,341,"Japan introduced a joint proposal by China, the EU, Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei allowing fishing vessel operators/captains and competent authorities of flag States to have access to the form GEN-3 of the observer report upon arrival of the vessel in port (WCPFC9-2012-DP/10 (rev 1)).  It was noted that the form GEN-3 contains less information than the full observer report but represents an acceptable compromise.  It was proposed that the form GEN-3 be provided to the vessel operator/captain by the observer provider."
WCPFC9,342,"Several CCMs, including FFA members, insisted that the safety of observers is paramount and this proposal would place them in jeopardy.  Furthermore, these CCMs noted that i) such provision of data is contradictory to the Commission’s data rules which state that observer data are not in the public domain, and ii) that observer data would need to be checked before being provided.  It was suggested that vessel operators/captains best protection is their own recordkeeping."
WCPFC9,343,"Some CCMs agreed with the proponent CCMs that the proposal would operationalize a flow of information that is already provided for in CMM 2007-01, Attachment K, Annex A, and that such information is essential if flag States are to follow-up on any non-compliances observed.  These CCMs considered that requests for the data through the Commission would require too much time, and the form GEN-3 summaries in the ROP Annual Report are not sufficiently detailed to allow flag States to investigate specific incidents.  These CCMs maintained that the priority is for flag States to be able to follow-up on potential non-compliances with management  45 measures.  Therefore, these CCMs agreed that the reports need not be provided to the vessel operators/captains."
WCPFC9,344,"Based on suggestions from the ED, after consultation with CCMs, the ROP Coordinator and SPC, and in order to address concerns about provision of observer data containing potential infractions to the coastal State as well as the flag State, the following text was considered:    “In order to improve the implementation of CMM 2007-01, whenever an observer report is submitted to the SPC a copy of the report including form GEN-3 is made available to the relevant flag State.  In the event of any infraction detected in the waters under the jurisdiction of a coastal State, a copy of the report including form GEN-3 shall also be made available to that coastal State.  “  The ED clarified that this language would apply only to ROP reports for the high seas; all ROP reports for national waters would need to be obtained bilaterally."
WCPFC9,345,There was no consensus reached on the proposed language or on the way forward on this issue.   9.5 Future Work Programme and Budget for 2013-2015
WCPFC9,346,The TCC Chair introduced the TCC Work Programme which was produced by a TCC8 SWG chaired by Nannette Malsol (Palau).  The work programme provides a list of priority core business tasks and project specific tasks for 2013-2015.  TCC budget issues are discussed within the FAC.
WCPFC9,347,FFA members noted their support for the TCC Work Programme.
WCPFC9,348,The EU suggested that the item “advice and recommendation for a revised south Pacific swordfish measure” should occur in 2013 rather than 2014.
WCPFC9,349,"WCPFC9 amended the TCC Work Programme (TCC8 Summary Report, Attachment I), to take up the issue of swordfish advice and recommendations in 2013 rather 2014, and then adopted it.  (Attachment Q) 9.6 Report on Data Access"
WCPFC9,350,The Chair noted the Secretariat’s report on the administration of WCPFC Data Access Rules and Procedures (WCPFC9-2012-IP/05) and invited CCMs to comment.
WCPFC9,351,"FFA members noted that requests for access to non-public domain data are increasing in number and complexity and suggested that the Secretariat develop a data warehouse of vessel attributes, based on standard data exchange protocols, as a component of the IMS."
WCPFC9,352,The Chair asked FFA members to work with the Secretariat intersessionally to develop a specific proposal and budget for this work.    AGENDA  ITEM  10  -  CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES 10.1 Consideration of New CMMs and Conservation Requirements  46 10.1.1 Scheme for Minimum Standards of Inspections in Port
WCPFC9,353,"The EU introduced a proposal for a WCPFC scheme for minimum port inspection standards to deter IUU fishing (WCPFC9-2012/DP-11 (rev 1)).  In comparison to proposals submitted by the EU in 2010 and 2011 for a fully-fledged FAO Port State Measures approach, this proposal focuses on the most essential elements of port inspections:  designation of ports, prior notifications, inspections and infringements.  Several aspects of the proposal remain flexible and can be discussed but as the inspections exclude nationally-flagged vessels and chartered vessels, it is not practical to also exclude licensed vessels and still maintain a useful scheme."
WCPFC9,354,"Several CCMs, including FFA members stated that they could not agree to a scheme that includes inspections of licensed vessels.  These CCMs reminded WCPFC9 that they already impose minimum standards for licensing and conduct their own port inspection programmes."
WCPFC9,355,Some CCMs supported the EU’s proposal on the basis that i) port inspections are one of the most important tools for combatting IUU fishing; ii) port state measures were identified as a priority by the recent WCPFC Independent Performance Review; and iii) this is one tool to help verify the supply chain of sustainable products to markets.
WCPFC9,356,"A representative of the Pew Environment Group noted that the goal is to establish minimum standards to promote consistency among CCMs, and that a failure to do so leaves the Commission vulnerable to IUU fishing activities.    10.1.2 Prohibition of Purse Seine Fishing Associated with Whale Sharks"
WCPFC9,357,Australia presented a proposal on the protection of whale sharks from purse seine fishing which had been discussed at WCPFC8 and agreed to be finalized at WCPFC9.  The WCPFC9 proposal represented a joint effort of Australia and Japan with input from other CCMs (WCPFC9-2012-DP/12 (rev 2)).
WCPFC9,358,Japan noted that it had had concerns regarding legal implementation of the measure but that these had been addressed.
WCPFC9,359,Several CCMs expressed support for the proposal citing its compatibility with measures already in place in PNA waters and its benefits for conservation of the whale shark.
WCPFC9,360,The USA called for the development of handling and safe release guidelines and suggested report language to this effect.
WCPFC9,361,FFA members supported the development of release guidelines and studies of post-release mortality but noted that these should not be viewed as a mitigatory measure designed to allow intentional setting on whale sharks.
WCPFC9,362,Japan noted that SC8 had developed draft handling and safe release guidelines and that hopefully these can be adopted next year.
WCPFC9,363,"WCPFC9 adopted a CMM on the protection of whale sharks from purse seine fishing operations (WCPFC9-2012/DP-12 (rev 2)).  As this measure does not include handling and safe release guidelines, WCPFC9 noted the need to continue development of such science-based guidelines through discussions at SC and TCC, including establishing field tests to  47 assess handling, post-release mortality, practicality and effectiveness. (Attachment R CMM 2012-03)"
WCPFC9,364,"An observer representing the Humane Society International, Greenpeace, Pew and WWF commended the Commission for taking steps toward protecting whale sharks but was perplexed by the exemption contained in the measure and concerned that it signals a lack of commitment on the part of WCPFC to fully protect shark species as a matter of priority.    10.1.3 Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS)"
WCPFC9,365,PNG presented a revised terms of reference (TOR) for an Intersessional Working Group (IWG) on a WCPFC CDS which represented a joint proposal from PNG and the EU (WCPFC9-2012/DP-14).  Previous issues relating to catch certificates for chartered vessels have been handled in the current consensus TOR proposal.
WCPFC9,366,The EU referred to its own proposal for a catch documentation scheme (WCPFC9-2012/DP-24 (rev 1)) but deferred presentation of the proposal to the IWG-CDS.
WCPFC9,367,All CCMs expressing an opinion voiced their support for the proposed TOR and CDS development.
WCPFC9,368,WCPFC9 adopted the terms of reference for the IWG-CDS contained in WCPFC9-2012/DP-14 (Attachment S)
WCPFC9,369,"FFA members proposed the first meeting of the IWG-CDS be held in Nouméa, New Caledonia in the first half of 2013 with Alois Kinol of PNG as Chair."
WCPFC9,370,The EU stated that it would need to consult with its member States before agreeing to the proposal.
WCPFC9,371,"The Chair noted that the date, location and Chair for the first meeting of the IWG-CDS would be agreed intersessionally and asked the Secretariat to assist with finalising this decision."
WCPFC9,372,The Secretariat noted that additional funds would be required to support a physical meeting of the IWG-CDS.    10.1.4 FAD Management
WCPFC9,373,"The USA introduced their proposal for FAD management (WCPFC9-2012-DP15), highlighting several key components.  The first of these is a requirement for FAD data to be collected by operators either as a FAD logbook, based on existing industry initiatives, or modifications to regional logsheets.  All data collected by FAD operators would be considered non-public domain data.  The need for such data has been demonstrated by a review of observer-collected data which found that only one third of the observer records contained useful data on FADS.  The proposed measure would also require Commission-wide FAD marking that is unique, readable by the observer, and permanent.  The third key component is the requirement to annually compile and analyse observer-collected FAD data.     48"
WCPFC9,374,"Some CCMs considered that this measure would best be incorporated into the revised CMM for tropical tunas (CMM 2012-01).  However, after discussions in the SWG on CMM 2012-01, the proposal continued as a stand-alone measure."
WCPFC9,375,"The USA and EU tabled a revised version as WCPFC9-2012-DP/15 (rev 1).  The new version contains a definition of FAD, a more flexible format for the FAD logbook (and an attachment specifying the data fields), and requirements for the timely provision of data.  The USA noted that the proposal is designed to provide data that can serve as the building blocks for a FAD management system."
WCPFC9,376,Some CCMs supported the FAD marking and observer components of the proposal but considered that a FAD logbook is unnecessary given 100% observer coverage.
WCPFC9,377,The EU strongly supported retention of the FAD logbook component considering it to be the core business of the proposal.
WCPFC9,378,"One CCM supported only the observer component of the proposal, suggesting that both the FAD logbook and FAD marking components were too ambitious."
WCPFC9,379,One CCM called for future discussions at TCC on how to replace marked FADs which are lost or damaged.
WCPFC9,380,"Some CCMs, including FFA members, requested that they be given more time to consider the proposal as they support the collection of additional FAD information, but are unsure about the need for a dedicated FAD logbook.     10.1.5 Shark Proposal"
WCPFC9,381,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members, presented a proposal to revise the WCPFC CMM on sharks prompted by increasing public attention to shark conservation and recent assessments presented to the SC which indicate shark stocks are not healthy.  Specifically, the proposal would i) make annual reporting of key shark species mandatory; ii) require that sharks be landed with their fins attached (with some exemptions); iii) ban wire leaders on longline gear; and iv) require targeted shark fisheries to develop management plans to limit catches to acceptable levels (WCPFC9-2012/DP-18)."
WCPFC9,382,"Some CCMs did not support the requirement to land sharks with their fins attached because of practical difficulties in separating frozen fins from carcasses at the point of landing.  These CCMs also did not support the ban on wire leaders as this gear is useful for targeting species other than sharks and its effectiveness as a shark mitigation measure has not been clearly demonstrated.  Furthermore, if wire leaders are not used sharks may bite off the hook thereby depriving the fishermen of the potential to re-use the hook."
WCPFC9,383,"The USA supported the requirement for fins to remain attached, noting that this is consistent with USA law, but opposed the ban on wire leaders.  The USA noted that there might be a misconception that wire leaders are only used when targeting sharks.  In fact, wire leaders are used for 90% of sets in the Hawaii deep-set longline fishery targeting BET, and this gear is used for branch line weighting to avoid seabird interactions.  In this fishery, 92% of blue sharks are released alive.  In Hawaii’s shallow-set longline fishery, which predominantly uses  49 monofilament leaders, the catch rate of blue sharks is four times higher due to latitude and set depth.  It was noted that the analysis presented in WCPFC9-2012/IP-14 was biased by the exclusion of the Hawaii longline and Australia Eastern tuna and billfish fisheries’ observer data sets, and that if these datasets had been included the results would likely to be opposite to those presented.  The USA considered that in future all scientific papers should be submitted to the SC for review before being presented to the Commission."
WCPFC9,384,Chinese Taipei informed WCPFC9 that it implemented a fins-attached rule in its fishery one year ago and based on complaints from fishermen about the difficulty of separating frozen fins from carcasses it is considering allowing fins to be tied on.  Chinese Taipei did not support the ban on wire leaders at this time but was willing to continue discussion of the topic.
WCPFC9,385,The EU noted that it is currently considering and likely to approve legislation to require that fins be naturally attached.
WCPFC9,386,Australia stated that it already has a fins-attached policy and bans wire leaders.  Studies in Australia have shown that monofilament leaders increase catch rates of tuna.
WCPFC9,387,Indonesia explained that it is currently undertaking a number of initiatives to reduce shark catches and would not support the proposal.
WCPFC9,388,"French Polynesia announced that as of 3 December 2012 it had banned catch and retention of shortfin mako shark, the only shark species still authorized to be caught in its waters, thus becoming the largest area in the world to permanently protect sharks.  French Polynesia encouraged other CCMs to support meaningful management measures for sharks."
WCPFC9,389,"FFA members reiterated their support for the proposal on the basis of the precautionary approach, their desire for high seas measures compatible with national shark sanctuaries, and the need to implement effective mitigation measures to reduce shark mortality.  These CCMs registered their disappointment that the proposal was not adopted and called for the Commission to continue its work on shark management."
WCPFC9,390,"An observer representing the Pew Environment Group, Greenpeace, WWF and the Humane Society International congratulated French Polynesia, Palau and RMI on their shark conservation efforts and urged the WCPFC to do more to manage shark interactions and reduce mortality.  These observers encouraged CCMs to adopt National Plans of Action for shark and to work toward a new shark CMM at WCPFC10.    10.1.6 Charter Proposal"
WCPFC9,391,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members, introduced a proposal to replace the expiring CMM on charter notification (CMM 2011-05) noting that several improvements to the measure had been made as a result of discussions at WCPFC8 and TCC8.  The proposal maintains the narrow focus of the previous measure on charter notification rather than other issues related to chartering arrangements.  One major difference in the new proposal is that it is designed to prevent any vessel from simultaneously being chartered to more than one chartering State (WCPFC9-2012-DP/17)."
WCPFC9,392,Some CCM raised questions about how catch is attributed under chartering arrangements.  One of these CCMs urged chartering States to notify the Secretariat (and the Secretariat to notify  50 the flag States) well before the fishing season to avoid cases of non-reporting and double reporting.
WCPFC9,393,The EU highlighted the low level of compliance with this measure and asked that charter notification non-compliances be addressed under the CMS.
WCPFC9,394,"FFA members acknowledged that this proposal is only designed to extend the existing CMM on charter notification, not to deal with other complex issues such as catch attribution.  These CCMs also noted that the definition of chartering remains vague and is applied differently by different CCMs."
WCPFC9,395,"As there was not consensus on adopting the proposal, FFA members proposed that the existing CMM (2011-05) be extended for three years."
WCPFC9,396,One CCM noted that this will allow for further consultation on a variety of issues associated with chartering arrangements including the catch attribution issues raised in the recent consultancy report (TCC8-2012-IP/07).
WCPFC9,397,"WCPFC9 agreed to extend the CMM on charter notification (CMM 2011-05) for a three-year period.  (Attachment T, CMM 2012-05)  10.1.7 Fishing Gear Damage"
WCPFC9,398,Japan presented a proposal first tabled at TCC8 which is designed to assist in resolving incidents involving fishing gear damage (WCPFC9-2012/DP-09).  The proposal provides for i) the flag State of fishing vessels that have experienced gear damage to report the incident to the Secretariat; ii) the Secretariat to use VMS data to identify vessels in the vicinity and inform all concerned flag States so that they can work toward resolution; and iii) the Secretariat to make an annual report on incidents to the TCC.
WCPFC9,399,One CCM endorsed Japan’s proposal stated that it too has experienced problems with gear conflicts.
WCPFC9,400,One CCM considered that the proposal was not necessary as most incidents can and should be handled through bilateral discussion.
WCPFC9,401,FFA members expressed reservations about the role of the Secretariat in mediating in fishing gear conflicts and the additional workload this might impose.  It was also noted that there are already avenues by which gear damage can be recorded (i.e. observer form GEN-6 and logsheets).  These CCMs were equally concerned about the environmental impacts of gear loss and called for all fishing gear to be marked.
WCPFC9,402,"While some further discussion occurred in the margins of WCPFC9, Japan decided to withdraw the proposal in the interest of time.    10.1.8 Pacific Bluefin"
WCPFC9,403,The Chair of the NC referred to his presentation under agenda item 8 and to NC8’s recommendation for a revised CMM for PBF (WCPFC9-2012-25).     51
WCPFC9,404,"WCPFC9 adopted the NC’s recommended CMM for PBF noting that the measure will be reviewed in 2013 pending the results of the soon to be completed ISC stock assessment. (Attachment U, CMM 2012-06)   10.1.9 CMM 2007-04 Seabirds"
WCPFC9,405,New Zealand introduced a proposal to mitigate the impact of fishing for highly migratory fish stocks on seabirds (WCPFC9-2012/DP-16 (rev 2)) which was also discussed at SC8 and TCC8.  The proposed measure is designed to allow higher latitude areas to utilize the most effective seabird mitigation measures and to align WCPFC-approved mitigation measures with those in other tuna RFMOs.  New Zealand noted that clause 7(i) on page 7 of WCPFC9-2012/DP-16 (rev 2) was intended to be deleted in the final draft.
WCPFC9,406,Several CCMs supported the proposal and thanked specialists from the Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) for their research and advice.
WCPFC9,407,"Korea indicated that it is making significant efforts towards seabird mitigation for its longline fisheries explaining that the Korean government held a workshop in Korea for seabird bycatch mitigation in collaboration with Birdlife International in November 2012. The workshop identified the need for sea-trial and outreach before full implementation of the new measure and technology by Korean longliners, especially for those operating in the Indian Ocean. At the workshop, it was agreed that Korean longliners and the Birdlife International should cooperate with each other in this regard."
WCPFC9,408,"WCPFC9 adopted WCPFC9-2012/DP-16 (rev 2) amended as described by NZ with the deletion of paragraph 7.i of Annex 1, to replace the existing WCPFC seabird mitigation measure in CMM 2007-04. (Attachment V, CMM 2012-07) 10.1.10 CMM 2010-06 IUU"
WCPFC9,409,"Tonga expressed its disappointment at the lack of support within the Commission for the development of guidelines to ensure coastal State satisfaction plays a major role in the resolution of WCPFC IUU Vessel listing decisions.  Tonga noted it will continue to progress development of these guidelines for application in national waters, regardless of whether the Commission accepts them as compatible measures for the high seas.    10.1.11 Access Agreements"
WCPFC9,410,"The EU tabled a proposal requiring CCMs that allow foreign-flagged vessels to fish in waters under their jurisdiction for species managed by WCPFC, and CCMs whose vessels fish in waters under the jurisdiction of another CCM for species managed by WCPFC pursuant to an agreement, provide the Commission with information on the time period, number of vessels, gear types, species catch limits, MCS measures and data reporting obligations stipulated in the agreement (WCPFC9-2012/DP-26 (rev 1)).  The EU considered that this proposal promotes transparency and accountability and would facilitate joint efforts to combat IUU fishing.  It noted a similar proposal has been adopted by ICCAT and IOTC.."
WCPFC9,411,FFA members expressed strong opposition to the proposal stating that access arrangements are a matter of national sovereignty.    52 10.2 Vessel Day Scheme
WCPFC9,412,There was no further discussion of this topic at WCPFC9 (see agenda item 1.2).    AGENDA  ITEM  11  -  AD HOC TASK GROUP-DATA  11.1 Chartering State Data Access
WCPFC9,413,Informal meetings of the AHTG-Data were led in the margins of WCPFC9 by Ana Taholo (Tonga) and focused on data access issues associated with chartering arrangements (WCFPC9-2012-31).
WCPFC9,414,"WCPFC9 noted the report of the informal meetings of AHTG-Data (WCPFC9-2012-36), including its proposed workplan for 2013."
WCPFC9,415,WCPFC9 tasked the AHTG-Data to continue to work intersessionally on procedures to facilitate chartering CCMs access to WCPFC data.    AGENDA  ITEM  12  -  REPORT OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE 12.1 Budget Approval for 2013 and Indicative Budgets for 2014 and 2015
WCPFC9,416,"The report of the FAC was presented by the Secretariat (WCPFC9-2012-22).  It was noted that the WCPFC budget for 2013 was agreed at $6,555,116 but that this figure does not include funding for the IWG-CDS, the second Management Objectives Workshop, and additional costs which will be associated with WCPFC10 if there is no volunteer to host the meeting."
WCPFC9,417,"WCPFC9 accepted the summary report and recommendations of FAC6 (WCPFC9-2012-22) Attachment W. (Note: late Commission decisions taken to agree on workshops, were added to the final budget figure for 2013.)    12.2 Guidelines for the Hosting of Meetings"
WCPFC9,418,There was no further discussion of this topic at WCPFC9 (see agenda item 1.2).    AGENDA  ITEM  13  -  STRATEGIC ISSUES 13.1 Report of the Management Objectives Workshop
WCPFC9,419,"The Executive Director presented the facilitators report of the first Management Objectives Workshop (MOW1) held 28-29 November 2012 in Manila, Philippines (WCPFC9-2012-14) which included a roadmap for future action.  MOW1 was facilitated by Ian Cartwright and assisted by an international panel composed of Dr Robin Allen, and Dr James Ianelli and as well  53 as representatives of FFA and SPC.  The workshop included sessions on management frameworks, scenarios for the south Pacific ALB and tropical tuna fisheries, and candidate reference points.  The roadmap recommended that an expert group develop refined candidate objectives, performance indicators and reference points as a “strawman” to be circulated to all CCMs.  The workshop also recommended that MOW2 be held just prior to WCPFC10 and would require a funding allocation in the budget for 2013.."
WCPFC9,420,All CCMs who commented on MOW1 noted that it was a useful and productive meeting.
WCPFC9,421,Some CCMs asked that the expert group be expanded to include representatives from CCMs.
WCPFC9,422,"The Executive Director noted that there would be cost implications associated with this proposal if the expert group intended to hold physical, rather than electronic meetings."
WCPFC9,423,Some CCMs considered that MOW2 and this initiative on management objectives should focus on developing management objectives and target reference points and allow the Commission’s subsidiary bodies (SC and NC) to continue to focus on limit reference points.  These CCMs suggested that the “strawman” produced by the expert group should be reviewed by the NC as well as SC.
WCPFC9,424,"An observer representing the Pew Environment Group, Greenpeace and WWF emphasized that the development of reference points is a priority task, and urged the Commission to i) adopt interim limit reference points as discussed by the SC; ii) set interim target reference points below the limit reference points; and iii) agree acceptable risk limits for breaching the reference points of not greater than 10%."
WCPFC9,425,"WCPFC9 agreed that the Secretariat would continue to work with the existing expert group to progress work on management objectives taking into consideration the need to involve CCMs who expressed an interest in the expert group to bring forward options on target rather than limit reference points for MOW2 to be held prior to WCPFC10. These recommendations will progress through SC9 and NC9 for comment and suggestions for improvements. (Attachment X, MOW agreed process for future action on management objectives  13.2 WCPFC Independent Performance Review"
WCPFC9,426,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC9-2012-13 containing a matrix of recommendations from the WCPFC Independent Performance Review which had been assigned to one of the WCPFC committees and given a priority of high, medium, low or underway.  WCPFC9 was invited to consider how to progress responses to the review panel’s recommendations."
WCPFC9,427,FFA members noted that the priorities assigned in the matrix may not reflect their views.  These CCMs suggested that the Commission’s subsidiary bodies should consider the relevant recommendations when developing their work plans.
WCPFC9,428,"The EU suggested sorting and splitting the matrix by WCPFC committee, and forwarding the relevant portion to each committee.  The EU also suggested adding a column to track progress under each recommendation.     54"
WCPFC9,429,"WCPFC9 agreed that the Secretariat will sort and split the WCPFC Independent Performance Review recommendation matrix by committee, add a column to track progress, and forward each portion to the relevant committee for action.    13.3 Future Structure of Commission Meetings"
WCPFC9,430,The Executive Director introduced a paper reviewing meeting arrangements in other tuna RFMOs and recommending options for re-structuring the WCPFC meeting calendar (WCPFC9-2012-21).  Three options were presented:  i) holding Commission meetings once every two years instead of annually; ii) holding TCC meetings just prior to Commission meetings; and iii) maintaining a September-October TCC meeting for 2-3 more years to finish work on conservation and management measures and holding a TCC meeting just prior to the Commission meeting to focus on compliance issues.
WCPFC9,431,"FFA members considered that none of the options was clearly preferable.  These CCMs encouraged the Commission to continue working toward minimising the number of meetings and maximising their efficiency, e.g. through prioritization of issues placed on each agenda."
WCPFC9,432,"Some CCMs echoed the points regarding the need to streamline and prioritise agendas, in particular to avoid covering the same ground at TCC and the annual Commission meeting.  There was a recognition that TCC currently serves as a pre-meeting of the Commission on conservation and management measures and as a compliance monitoring body, and that TCC should be allowed to focus exclusively on the latter function."
WCPFC9,433,"One CCM supported the third option presented by the Executive Director as it would eventually allow TCC to focus on compliance, and over time achieve a cost savings by holding TCC and Commission meetings back-to-back."
WCPFC9,434,The Executive Director noted one suggestion of interest and he felt there was merit in moving the Commission meeting from December to March but that the Commission’s fiscal calendar would need to be shifted to align with the new schedule.    AGENDA  ITEM  14  -  ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS 14.1 GEF ABNJ Endorsement
WCPFC9,435,"The Executive Director introduced a paper describing the Global Environment Facility’s (GEF) project on Sustainable Management of Tuna Fisheries and Biodiversity in the Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ) (WCPFC9-2012-24).  Project development has been a joint activity of FAO (the GEF agency), the five tuna RFMOs, FFA, PNA, SPC, the Government of Fiji, the Government of Ghana, the USA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, BirdLife International, the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation, WWF and industry.  WCPFC’s proposals for bycatch information systems and shark management have been built into the project with WCPFC and SPC in leading/co-leading roles."
WCPFC9,436,"Jeremy Turner (FAO) presented further details on the project.  The component on sustainable management of tuna fisheries and biodiversity is part of a larger project with a total budget of over $300 million with a GEF contribution of $50 million.  The budget for the tuna portion of the project is over $178 million with a GEF contribution of over $27 million.  GEF typically requires co-financing by project partners in a ratio of 5:1.  The co-financing need not be  55 cash contributions and may represent in-kind services in support of the project.  Many of these in-kind services will represent core activities of the project partners which are occurring as part of their normal day-to-day operations regardless of whether the GEF ABNJ project is approved.  Three key project components for the WCPFC were highlighted:    a. sustainable fisheries management (including development of reference points and harvest control rules, ecosystem-based management, and VDS as a rights-based management system); b. monitoring, control and surveillance to address IUU fishing (including best practice identification and implementation, improvements to the t-RFMO Consolidated List of Authorized Vessels (CLAV), electronic monitoring trials, MCS intelligence systems, and traceability improvements); and  c. reducing the ecosystem impacts of tuna fishing (including enhanced bycatch information management systems, and pan-Pacific shark data improvement and management).    WCPFC will lead the bycatch and shark components, is expecting to receive direct support for IMS enhancements for MCS analytical capability, cooperate on several others, and benefit from nearly all.  The next steps in the project preparation are to gain the endorsement of project partners; submit the project to GEF in late December 2012; hopefully receive GEF endorsement in January 2013; and, in accordance with GEF requirements, start the project no later than May 2013."
WCPFC9,437,"Several CCMs, including project partners Fiji and USA, voiced their strong support for the project and encouraged the Commission to endorse it."
WCPFC9,438,"Some CCMs noted that despite the fact that a large number of members had supported it, ICCAT had not endorsed the project, perhaps due to confusion over the co-financing issue."
WCPFC9,439,Some CCMs commented that they now understood that the project will provide additional funds from GEF for the Commission’s existing work and that no cash contribution was required from the Commission’s budget.
WCPFC9,440,Some CCMs continued to express reservations about i) whether there would be any sacrificing or re-prioritizing of Commission objectives as a result of the project; ii) how specific co-financing amounts had been derived; and iii) what specific deliverables would be provided to the Commission.
WCPFC9,441,"The Executive Director and FAO reconfirmed that there will be no cash contribution from the Commission to the project and that the identified co-financing from WCPFC represents the value of work that is already being done.  They noted that the document provided to WCPFC9 was a summary version of an extensive, detailed and complex document prepared to support the GEF application process, and agreed to provide additional details in the margins to interested CCMs."
WCPFC9,442,"Later in the meeting FAO summarized the proposal in a statement which emphasized that i) it will supplement, and not divert, the resources WCPFC is devoting to sustainable fisheries management; ii) it is enthusiastically supported by regional and national partners; and iii) it represents a global contribution to sustainable use and biodiversity protection.     56"
WCPFC9,443,"Some CCMs appreciated the additional information provided but remained concerned about how priorities were being set both within the GEF ABNJ proposal (e.g. why certain projects were chosen over others) and within the Commission in deciding how and to what extent to support the GEF work (e.g. whether demands on the Secretariat and subsidiary bodies would increase and if so, how priorities would be set)."
WCPFC9,444,Some CCMs considered that participation in the GEF ABNJ project could only bring benefits to the Commission and questioned whether there was sufficient basis to reject an offer of additional funding of $27 million.
WCPFC9,445,"The Executive Director made a presentation confirming that the GEF ABNJ will impose no financial cost on the Commission.  He explained that only two project components require direct involvement from the Secretariat:  i) development of an Information Management System which incorporates geographic information systems to support monitoring, control and surveillance activities; and ii) improved and integrated shark management which will be co-led by WCPFC and IATTC with a full-time, GEF-funded coordinator.  Other benefits to the Commission will accrue from electronic monitoring projects to be conducted in Fiji and Ghana; support for MCS capabilities in SIDS (via FFA); support for broadening of the VDS (via PNA); shark assessment science funding for SPC; bycatch mitigation information system funding for SPC; bycatch mitigation trials to be conducted in Indian and Atlantic oceans; and programmatic reporting support to be provided by FAO.  The Executive Director confirmed that the work of the WCPFC subsidiary bodies would not be impacted and committed to preparing a WCPFC-GEF ABNJ work plan and circulating it to CCMs in January 2013."
WCPFC9,446,CCMs thanked the Executive Director for the additional information in the presentation and for his commitment to provide a paper on how the WCPFC elements of the GEF ABNJ linked to the WCPFC work in January 2013.
WCPFC9,447,FFA members asked that this work plan provide details on how SIDS are expected to interact with and benefit from the project.
WCPFC9,448,"WCPFC9 endorsed participation and in-kind co-financing in the amount of $6,347,000 for the GEF ABNJ Sustainable Management of Tuna Fisheries and Biodiversity Project.    14.2 EU Proposal to Amend Rule 20"
WCPFC9,449,"The EU explained that rather than tabling a specific suggestion, it had hoped to trigger a discussion of better procedures for the submission of proposals for Commission meetings (WCPFC9-2012/DP-01).  It noted that the Executive Director referred to the WCPFC2 Summary Report, para. 30 in specifying the deadline for WCPFC9 submissions in the Meeting Notice for WCPFC9 (WCPFC9-2012-01 (rev 1)).  This paragraph states that “Members would try to submit draft proposals 30 days prior to the Annual Session of the Commission”."
WCPFC9,450,"The Executive Director explained that Rule 20 of the Commission Rules of Procedure allows for proposals to be circulated not later than the day preceding the meeting as a general rule, and even on the same day at the Chairman’s discretion."
WCPFC9,451,"FFA members stated that this issue is related to the issue of streamlining and prioritizing of meeting agendas discussed repeatedly throughout WCPFC9.  While appreciating that Rule 20 provides flexibility, late submission might not be conducive to proper consideration of proposals,  57 and therefore FFA members recommended that proposals be submitted well in advance of the session.   14.3 Election of Officers"
WCPFC9,452,The Executive Director invited CCMs to nominate individuals for vacant WCPFC officer positions (WCPFC9-2012-27).
WCPFC9,453,WCPFC9 accepted the nomination of the FAC and confirmed Moses Amos (Vanuatu) as Co-Chair of the FAC.  The second FAC Co-Chair position remains vacant.
WCPFC9,454,WCPFC9 accepted the nomination of the NC and confirmed Masanori Miyahara (Japan) as Chair of the NC and after discussion accepted a recommendation from the floor for Ben Tabios as NC Vice Chair.
WCPFC9,455,"WCPFC9 expressed its appreciation for the work of Dr Naozumi Miyabe (Japan), outgoing Chair of the SC."
WCPFC9,456,"Dr Shui-Kai Chang (Chinese Taipei) was nominated as Chair of the SC.  Upon request, the legal advisor of the WCPFC provided legal advice.  Ludwig Kumoru (PNG) was subsequently nominated as Chair of the SC."
WCPFC9,457,WCPFC9 accepted the nomination and confirmed Ludwig Kumoru (PNG) as Chair of the SC. The SC vice Chair remains vacant.
WCPFC9,458,WCPFC9 accepted the nomination of the TCC and confirmed Alexa Cole (USA) as Vice Chair of the TCC.  Nominations for WCPFC Chair were received for Dr Charles Karnella (USA) and Matthew Hooper (New Zealand).  It was decided at a Heads of Delegation meeting to proceed with an election by secret ballot.
WCPFC9,459,WCPFC9 confirmed Dr Charles Karnella as WCPFC Chair for a second term.  Matthew Hooper was then nominated and confirmed as WCPFC Vice-Chair.
WCPFC9,460,It was agreed that the SC vice chair and the FAC co-chair would be agreed out of session if possible.   14.4 Venue for Next Meeting
WCPFC9,461,"The Chair invited CCMs to consider the venue for WCPFC meetings to be held in the coming year (WCPFC9-2012-27).  As no offers for hosting the meetings were forthcoming, the Chair tasked the Executive Director with determining the most economically and logistically attractive venue for each meeting."
WCPFC9,462,"The Executive Director noted that the default location for meetings is Pohnpei, FSM, but that in the case of WPCFC10 the large number of attendees might require a larger venue such as those available in Guam, USA or Cairns, Australia."
WCPFC9,463,FFA members encouraged the Commission to hold its meetings in SIDS venues.     58
WCPFC9,464,One CCM suggested that the annual meeting of the Commission could be held in January rather than December.
WCPFC9,465,Other CCMs preferred the meeting to be held as usual in December.
WCPFC9,466,"The Executive Director noted that by default WCPFC10 would be held 2-6 December 2013 in Pohnpei, and due to venue size restrictions would necessarily be limited to 250 attendees.  SC9 would be held 6-14 August 2013 in Pohnpei, and TCC9 would be held 26 September – 1 October 2013 in Pohnpei.  The MOW2 is proposed to be held just prior to WCPFC10.  Details on the proposed dates for the IWG-CDS will be circulated intersessionally."
WCPFC9,467,"CCMs did not raise any objections to these proposals, although the EU noted that the proposed dates for TCC overlap with meetings of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization."
WCPFC9,468,Japan offered to host a working group meeting on CMM 2012-01 in Japan and noted that this would likely be held in August.
WCPFC9,469,"The Executive Director indicated that the standard cost of $150,000 for a WCPFC annual meeting will increase to $275,000 if the meeting is unhosted.  He also estimated the cost of an IWG-CDS meeting at $140,000 and a working group meeting on CMM 2012-01 at $90,000.  These additional costs were accepted and added to the budget."
WCPFC9,470,"WCPFC9 confirmed dates for meetings in 2013 as follows:    Meeting Dates 2013 Venue IWG-CDS TBD (first half of 2013) TBC SC9 6-14 August 2013 Pohnpei, FSM Working Group on CMM 2012-01 TBD (August) Japan NC9 2-5 (September) Japan TCC9 26 September – 1 October 2013 Pohnpei, FSM MOW2 TBD (late November) TBC default Pohnpei, FSM WCPFC10 2-6 December 2013 TBC default Pohnpei, FSM  AGENDA  ITEM  15  -  OTHER MATTERS"
WCPFC9,471,There were no other matters raised.  AGENDA  ITEM  16  -  SUMMARY REPORT
WCPFC9,472,"A summary report was prepared by the rapporteur and the Secretariat, and circulated to CCMs for comment.     59 AGENDA  ITEM  17  -  CLOSE OF MEETING"
WCPFC9,473,"The Chair expressed his sincere appreciation to the Government of the Philippines for hosting the meeting.  He also thanked the Secretariat for their work throughout the year, and his personal assistant, Ted  for his support during the meeting."
WCPFC9,474,The Executive Director noted that Roberto Cesari (EU) would be changing posts shortly and that his robust interventions would be greatly missed in future WCPFC meetings.
WCPFC9,475,"The Chair closed WCPFC9 at 19:25 on Thursday, 6 December 2012."
