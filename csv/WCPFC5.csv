AGENDA  ITEM  2  -  MEMBERSHIP   2.1 Status of the Convention"
WCPFC5,13,"The depository for the Convention, New Zealand, presented WCPFC5-2008/07, summarizing the status of the Convention as of 10 November 2008. New Zealand noted that since its last report at WCPFC4, it has not received notification of any instruments of ratification of or accession to the Convention.   2.2 Applications for Observer status"
WCPFC5,14,"Observer status was granted to the following four new applicants: Liberia,Vietnam,  International Sustainable Seafood Foundation, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).   3  2.3 Applications for Cooperating Non-member status"
WCPFC5,15,"The Commission considered applications from Belize and Indonesia for the renewal of their CNM status, and new applications from Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico and Senegal.  Documentation supporting these applications was distributed to delegations as WCPFC5-2008/08, and a summary of these materials was provided as WCPFC5-2008/IP10."
WCPFC5,16,Indonesia presented a statement summarizing its application for renewal of its CNM status for 2009 (Attachment D).
WCPFC5,17,WCPFC5 approved Indonesia’s application for CNM status for 2009.
WCPFC5,18,Belize presented a statement summarising its application for renewal of its CNM status for 2009 (Attachment E).
WCPFC5,19,"Some CCMs, while not opposing Belize’s application, expressed concern about the beneficial ownership of some fishing vessels flagged to Belize and currently operating in the WCPF Convention Area, and the extent to which Belize could exercise control over its vessels, and currently operating in the WCPF Convention Area. One member noted the relevance of “real interest” and the need to ensure that States are not able to come into the region, fish in an illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fashion, and then claim CNM status. Concern was expressed that the failure of other regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) was leading to an increase in capacity in the WCPFC region, and that only applicants that could demonstrate a past presence in the region should receive CNM status. It was incumbent on the Commission to place limits, in line with those of past efforts, and accept applicants but limit capacity effort."
WCPFC5,20,"Belize asked that the focus remain on the compliance record of the beneficial owner, not simply the State from which the beneficial owner operates. Belize also noted the desirability of maintaining consistent standards with regard to beneficial ownership for both members and CNMs."
WCPFC5,21,"Other Cooperating Non-members and participating Territories (CCMs) fully supported Belize’s application, acknowledging its record of compliance with CMMs developed by the WCPFC and information requests over the past year."
WCPFC5,22,"In response to Belize’s stated intention to seek full membership in the Commission, some FFA members noted that the granting of CNM status should not be viewed as conferment of a right to become a Commission Member, or to seek an allocation that could lead to overcapacity and overfishing. Clarification was also sought as to whether ratification of, or accession to, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the UN Fish Stocks Agreement  (UNFSA)  should be necessary requirements for CNM status."
WCPFC5,23,"Martin Tsamenyi explained that CMM 2004-02 does not require ratification of, or accession to, the UNCLOS or UNFSA as prerequisites for CNM status. He noted that there are some Commission Members who are not parties to both treaties.    4"
WCPFC5,24,"Some FFA members stated their support for CNM applications, which provide opportunities for small island developing State (SIDS) members of the Commission and participating territories to maximize economic benefits from the sustainable management of the tuna resources in the Convention Area."
WCPFC5,25,"WCPFC5 approved Belize’s application for CNM status for 2009, with the understanding that Belize will cooperate with WCPFC Members in the monitoring and control of its longline vessels."
WCPFC5,26,"The Chair noted that Belize had written to contracting parties requesting an invitation to accede to the Convention, and asked the Executive Director to progress this matter inter-sessionally."
WCPFC5,27,"El Salvador presented a statement supporting its application for CNM status (Attachment F). El Salvador committed to limiting its fishing in the Convention Area to two vessels that were granted licenses to fish in Kiribati’s EEZ, although El Salvador noted an interest in entering into further licensing arrangements with coastal State Commission Members should such opportunities become available under the vessel day scheme (VDS)."
WCPFC5,28,"Representatives of the FFA Secretariat and Kiribati stated that the two El Salvadorean vessels fishing in Kiribati’s EEZ in 2008 complied with vessel monitoring system (VMS) requirements for part of the time: one vessel reported from July to the present, and the other reported in April–May and in October–November. It was noted that reporting began in April 2008 because up until that time, these vessels were not on the WCPFC Record of Vessels and, thus, could not be entered into the FFA vessel registry."
WCPFC5,29,"In response to a request for clarification, Martin Tsamenyi explained that, under CMM 2004-01, Commission Members have agreed not to license non-members of the Commission or CNMs to fish in the Convention Area. Therefore, unless CMM 2004-01 is amended, coastal State Commission Members would be in violation of CMM 2004-01 if they license non-CCMs to fish in their EEZs."
WCPFC5,30,"In response to a question regarding its accession to UNCLOS and UNFSA, El Salvador responded that its accession was complicated by domestic legal issues but that its status with regard to these treaties notwithstanding, its intention in applying for CNM status was to comply with all applicable WCPFC CMMs."
WCPFC5,31,"With regard to El Salvador’s history of fishing on the high seas in the Convention Area in 2001–2004, 29 days of fishing had been recorded in the data available to the Commission."
WCPFC5,32,"Following reaffirmation from El Salvador that it would operate only two purse seiners in the WCPF Convention Area, and that its operations on the high seas would be in accordance with existing CMMs adopted by the Commission, WCPFC5 approved El Salvador’s application for CNM status for 2009."
WCPFC5,33,"Ecuador, Senegal and Mexico presented statements supporting their applications for CNM status (Attachments G, H and I)."
WCPFC5,34,"It was agreed that these three applications would be evaluated against a flowchart, based on CMM 2004-02, developed at Fourth Regular Session of the Technical and  5 Compliance Committee (TCC4 Summary Report, Attachment I) by a small group consisting of representatives from the USA and PNG. In addition to applying the flowchart to the applications, the USA and PNG co-facilitators met with applicants to clarify any outstanding issues; to confirm their understanding of how CMMs will apply to their existing or proposed fishing activities; and to explore whether each applicant was proposing any voluntary agreements to limit its catch or effort in the Convention Area given the status of the stocks."
WCPFC5,35,"Regarding Ecuador, the USA and PNG found that the application generally met the criteria for CNM status, but that there remained issues regarding the provision of operational data. In particular, due to gaps in the VMS record for seven Ecuadorean vessels fishing under license to Kiribati, there were questions regarding whether the operations of all of these vessels were conducted wholly within Kiribati’s national waters. It was noted that at WCPFC4, Kiribati committed to including a requirement for the Ecuadorean vessels to refrain from fishing on the high seas as a condition on their licenses."
WCPFC5,36,"In addition to the concerns raised by the group about possible unauthorized fishing on the high seas of the Convention Area by Ecuador over the past year, the USA stated that the historical data provided by Ecuador in support of its CNM application, indicated that there had been illegal operations conducted in the USA’s EEZ.  In addition, the USA stated that it has sought information and cooperation from Ecuador over the past 18 months regarding additional illegal fishing activity by Ecuadorian-flagged vessels in the USA EEZ and in other Member’s national waters. Despite attempts to settle this issue with Ecuadorean representatives, the USA noted that its concerns remain unresolved and, thus, it could not support Ecuador’s application."
WCPFC5,37,Ecuador responded that it is investigating the issues raised by the USA through its own internal procedures. A legal opinion has been sought from the Ecuadorian Attorney General and matters cannot proceed until this opinion is provided.
WCPFC5,38,"Other CCMs agreed that if Ecuador fished in the Convention Area outside of Kiribati’s EEZ in 2008, then i) such operations were clearly unsanctioned by the Commission; ii) Ecuador’s application for CNM status should not be approved due to failure to demonstrate a favourable record of compliance with Convention provisions and WCPFC CMMs adopted under para 5 of CMM 2004-02; and iii) punitive measures should be considered."
WCPFC5,39,"Kiribati spoke in favour of Ecuador’s application, emphasizing the importance of the existing Ecuadorean licenses to its economy. Kiribati asserted that issues with implementation of the VMS are being handled by FFA and that reports from Kiribati’s observers on board two of the Ecuadorean vessels will be provided to the Commission. Kiribati stated that according to its understanding, the Ecuadorean vessels were not fishing on the high seas."
WCPFC5,40,"Tuvalu also expressed its support for Ecuador’s application. Tuvalu reminded the Commission that it will be necessary to enter into bilateral arrangements with countries such as Ecuador in order to develop its fishery and realize the economic benefits of that development.  Tuvalu therefore supported Ecuador’s application. As a further step, Tuvalu requested that CMM 2004-01 and CMM 2004-02 be amended to allow SIDS to license non-Members to fish in their national waters on the understanding that such fishing would comply with all WCPFC CMMs.    6"
WCPFC5,41,"WCPFC5 agreed to approve Ecuador’s CNM status for a one-year period beginning 15 February 2009, subject to the following conditions (WCPFC5-2008/IP15):    a. Ecuador is granted Cooperating Non-member status for 2009, contingent upon satisfactory resolution of the USA’s concerns over the provision of necessary information relating to alleged violations in its EEZ. If Ecuador does not provide all requested information to the satisfaction of the USA by 15 February 2009, its Cooperating Non-member status will be null and void. If the USA’s concerns have been addressed by 15 February 2009, it will certify to the WCPFC Secretariat its satisfaction with the information provided.   b. The exemption granted to Kiribati at WCPFC4, allowing it to license fishing vessels from non-CCMs, will expire on 15 February 2009.   c. If Ecuador’s Cooperating Non-member status becomes null and void, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Nauru will be given an exemption for 2009 from CMM 2004-01 to allow seven Ecuadorian vessels to fish in waters under their national jurisdiction. It shall be a term and condition of the licenses for those vessels to fish in Kiribati, Tuvalu and Nauru waters that those vessels are not authorized to fish on the high seas of the Convention Area. In addition, this exemption is granted with the understanding that no other Ecuadorian-flagged vessels will fish on the high seas of the Convention Area. Such activities will be considered as undermining the intent and effectiveness of WCPFC conservation and management measures. d. Should Ecuador’s Cooperating Non-member status become effective, the following provisions would apply.   i. Ecuador commits that it will submit to high seas boardings and inspections in accordance with the Commission’s High Seas Boarding and Inspection procedures. ii. Noting that at the time of making the decision, the Commission had not received sufficient data to be able to confirm the applicable purse-seine days limit for Ecuador on the high seas for 2009. Consequently, Ecuador will be limited to zero days during 2009. The Commission noted that as soon as Ecuador provides to the WCPFC all relevant catch and effort data that would enable the WCPFC Secretariat to calculate and verify an applicable days limit pursuant to the new CMM for yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna, this limit will be appropriately adjusted. If this is not able to be verified to the satisfaction of all members, Ecuador shall not fish on the high seas of the Convention Area in 2009. iii. Ecuador is willing and able to ensure full compliance by all its vessels with the conservation and management measures of the WCPFC and to respond to any alleged unauthorized activities by vessels flying its flag that have been brought to its attention.   iv. Ecuador commits to provide all fishery data required by the Commission in a timely manner.   v. Ecuador commits to comply with appropriate bilateral agreements and national laws and regulations of coastal States.   vi. Ecuador commits to have observers on board Ecuadorian-flagged vessels during all trips in the Convention Area, including high seas and EEZs.     7"
WCPFC5,42,"All CCMs and CNM applicants were reminded that because the official language of the Commission is English, all documents submitted to the Commission must be prepared in English, or accompanied by an English translation."
WCPFC5,43,"Regarding Senegal’s application for CNM status, the working group found that it met the criteria of CMM 2004-02."
WCPFC5,44,"Senegal committed to limiting its fishing activities in the WCPF Convention Area to one longline vessel, the Robaleira, which was fishing in 2005. This represents a reduction in Senegal’s fishing capacity in the Convention Area since 2007 when both the Robaleira and the Vieirasa fished in the Convention Area (WCPFC-2008/OP10 (Rev.1))."
WCPFC5,45,"One CCM questioned the data provided in Senegal’s supplemental documentation, in particular the very high catches of skipjack reported by the Robaleira in 2006, and inconsistent ratios of reported swordfish to shark catches, and asked that this be examined and that the Commission revisit how the proposed measure on swordfish would apply to Senegal."
WCPFC5,46,"Noting the concern regarding the species composition of the catches reported by Senegal to the Commission in WCPFC5-2008/OP10 (Rev. 1), and Senegal’s commitment to limit fishing activity to one longline vessel, WCPFC5 agreed to grant CNM status to Senegal for 2009."
WCPFC5,47,"Regarding Mexico’s application for CNM status, the working group found that it met the criteria in CMM 2004-02."
WCPFC5,48,"Mexico committed to the following (WCPFC5-2008/OP06):  a. Submission of all data required by the Commission in a timely manner; b. Full participation in the Commission VMS programme; c. Applicable requirements pertaining to WCPFC observer programmes; d. Limiting its fishing effort to not more than six purse-seine vessels fishing only in the EEZs of WCPFC Members, in accordance with appropriate bilateral agreements and pursuant to the VDS; e. Ensuring there is no transfer of effort from the IATTC area into the WCPF Convention Area during any IATTC closures; f. Abiding by all of the WCPFC CMMs, consistent with the above and with all relevant rights and duties under international law; g. Full cooperation with WCPFC Members in the conservation and management of Pacific bluefin tuna; and h. Full cooperation with WCPFC Members, particularly with SIDS."
WCPFC5,49,"Chinese Taipei and Japan spoke in support of Mexico’s application, citing its long history of fishing and good record of compliance in other RFMOs."
WCPFC5,50,"In response to a question, Mexico clarified that it is not currently a party to any bilateral access agreements in the WCPF Convention Area, as it did not yet have CNM status, but that if its CNM application is successful it may consider such arrangements."
WCPFC5,51,"Noting a number of compliance commitments and a voluntary agreement to limit fishing effort to no more than six purse-seine vessels fishing only in waters under  8 national jurisdiction of EEZs of WCPFC members, WCPFC5 agreed to grant CNM status to Mexico for 2009.    AGENDA  ITEM  3  -  MEMBER STATEMENTS 3.1 Statements by CCMs"
WCPFC5,52,"French Polynesia formally offered to host the Sixth Regular Session of WCPFC (WCPFC6) in Tahiti (Attachment J). Statements were also made by Kiribati, New Caledonia, Chinese Taipei, Palau (on behalf of FFA members), Tokelau, FSM and the Philippines. These statements are contained in Attachments K through Q.   AGENDA  ITEM  4  -  SCIENCE ISSUES 4.1 Report of the Fourth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee"
WCPFC5,53,"The Chair of the Scientific Committee (Dae-Yeon Moon, Korea) presented the summary outcomes of the Fourth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee (SC4) held in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea from 11–22 August 2008."
WCPFC5,54,"The matters considered by the Scientific Committee (SC) and its six Specialist Working Groups included: • a review of the fisheries in the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) and the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO); • a review of stock status of bigeye tuna, skipjack tuna and southern albacore in the Convention Area; swordfish and striped marlin stocks in the South Pacific; and northern area stocks, including albacore, Pacific bluefin tuna, striped marlin and swordfish; • a review of a research proposal on Pacific-wide bigeye tuna biology, and a project report on reference points and management strategy evaluation (MSE); • bycatch mitigation issues and ecological risk assessment (ERA);  • issues associated with data available to the Commission and initiatives to address data gaps, the status of the Indonesia and Philippines Data Collection Project, and the Pacific Tuna Tagging Programme; • cooperation with other organizations; • the special requirements of SIDS and territories; • the process for developing the SC work programme and the 2009–2011 SC work programme; and • administrative matters associated with the functioning of the SC."
WCPFC5,55,"John Hampton (SPC-Oceanic Fisheries Programme, SPC-OFP), Scientific Services Provider) made a presentation on the status of the stocks as discussed at SC4 in August 2008. This presentation highlighted that the latest stock assessments had determined that for yellowfin tuna, there is a relatively high possibility that overfishing is occurring and that there is a small probability that it is in an overfished state; for bigeye tuna overfishing is occurring in the WCPO with a high probability that both adult and total biomass are predicted to become over-fished at 2003–2006 levels of fishing mortality and long-term average levels of recruitment.    9"
WCPFC5,56,"In response to questions, John. Hampton made the following points:  a. Declines in the number of skipjack migrating toward the coast of Japan as reported by Japanese fishermen might be a cause for concern if they represent a range contraction. While Japanese data are used in assessments, most data derive from equatorial areas.   b. Above-average bigeye tuna recruitment since 1985 has allowed the stock to remain above maximum sustainable yield (MSY) levels despite high levels of fishing mortality.   c. Catch data for the purse-seine fishery may underestimate the actual catch of bigeye tuna by a substantial amount. If so, the results of the stock assessment would be more pessimistic, and a greater proportion of stock depletion would be attributed to the purse-seine fishery.   d. The recent assessment of South Pacific swordfish conducted by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO, Australia) and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New Zealand focused on the southwestern portion (west of 180o) of the WCPO. Attempts were made to construct a model, including the south-central Pacific, however there were problems with this approach due to the relatively weak data available for the assessment for the south-central area.  There was also a suggestion of relatively low mixing of swordfish between the southwest and south-central areas.   e. Critical uncertainties in some bigeye tuna data remain, particularly estimates for the purse-seine and Indonesian and Philippines domestic fisheries. The regional observer programme and the Indonesia-Philippines Data Collection Project are expected to improve data quality.  f. Emerging evidence from IATTC tagging studies show limited movement of bigeye tuna from the EPO to the WCPF Convention Area, but movements of bigeye tuna from the Central Pacific are less well known. Although separation of the stock into the IATTC and WCPFC areas is problematic, it is still feasible to manage bigeye in the two areas separately. SPC and IATTC routinely discuss and compare stock assessments of bigeye tuna, including comparison with a Pacific-wide model.   g. The results of the southern swordfish assessment are based on data for the southwest areas and, thus, apply only to that portion of the stock.   h. SPC regularly produces statistics on the rate of bycatch and discards in the purse-seine fishery. The rate is generally low (<5%).   4.2 Review of transitional arrangements for science structure and function"
WCPFC5,57,Graeme Parkes (Marine Resources Assessment Group – MRAG) presented a report on the Independent Review of the Commission’s Transitional Science Structure and Functions (WCPFC5-2008/11). The review encompassed an evaluation of scientific data and information functions; science functions; and institutional analysis. A number of recommendations were made with regard to data submission; data management and confidentiality; data custodianship services; contracting of research; standards for contracted research; conflicts of interest; cost effectiveness of contracted research; presentation of CCM research at the SC; review of ISC assessments; resourcing in the Secretariat; the relationship between the SC and the ISC; and organization of the SC.     10
WCPFC5,58,"In discussion, one CCM raised the need to provide a quantitative cost comparison of various options for data custodianship, and expressed a desire to see a quantitative evaluation of the performance of different RFMO models for research, assessment and data analysis."
WCPFC5,59,"Another CCM reiterated concerns about one of the issues presented in the report (i.e. the lack of access to background material, such as data and papers, used in the ISC assessments)."
WCPFC5,60,"Other CCMs suggested that the report could usefully elaborate on other issues, such as the need for economic and social data relating to fishing capacity; the potential for political interference in scientific work; and the possibility of reciprocal peer review arrangements between WCPFC and other RFMOs, in particular the IATTC."
WCPFC5,61,Concerns were raised that the report’s proposal to require that participants in SPC’s preparatory stock assessment workshops have scientific credentials may discriminate against FFA members.
WCPFC5,62,"Several CCMs made statements in support of the report and its proposals, including statements of appreciation for the high quality and cost-effective work of SPC as the WCPFC Science Services Provider. Many of these statements, however, suggested that the issues in the report should be discussed by the ISC, SC, Northern Committee (NC) and/or the Ad Hoc Task Group–Data before drawing any conclusions about the way forward."
WCPFC5,63,"WCPFC5 agreed that the Independent Review of the Commission’s Transitional Science Structure and Function:    a. Be finalized by the consultant following the receipt of any additional comments from CCMs by 1 March 2009; b. Be considered at the 2009 sessions of the ISC, SC, NC and/or Ad Hoc Task Group–Data; c. Be further considered at WCPFC6, taking into account the advice and recommendations of the ISC, SC, NC and/or Ad Hoc Task Group–Data."
WCPFC5,64,"In addition, WCPFC5 requested:  a. CCMs to actively work toward removing domestic barriers to data submission; b. The Secretariat work with ISC, SPC-OFP and relevant CCMs to develop a strategy for the incorporation of ISC data into the Commission’s data holdings; and  c. The Secretariat prepare for consideration of the 2009 sessions of the ISC, NC and Commission, a proposal that would support the periodic peer review of ISC and SC stock assessments. 4.3 Reference points"
WCPFC5,65,"Campbell Davies (CSIRO) presented work designed to identify the potential costs, benefits and difficulties of alternative approaches for identification of appropriate reference points within the WCPO (WCPFC5-2008/12). The presentation covered the  11 background to reference points, decision rules and risk; default reference points for WCPFC; and management strategy evaluation."
WCPFC5,66,"Work programme recommendations presented in the paper included:    • A small technical workshop (or discussion paper) to consider the technical definition of alternative limit reference points and make specific recommendations to SC and WCPFC6 on the range of potential reference points;  • Single- and multi-species case studies using short-term constant catch projections and current assessment models (southern swordfish or albacore and the tropical tuna species mix, respectively, were recommended);  • A capacity building workshop(s) for CCMs on reference points and MSE convened as a special workshop under the Methods Working Group at SC5.   • A management objectives workshop for discussion and recommendations to the Commission on technical interpretation and specification of fisheries management objectives."
WCPFC5,67,Several CCMs stated their strong support for articulation of the Commission’s fisheries management objectives and the development of reference points as tools for effective implementation of these objectives.
WCPFC5,68,"Some of these CCMs, in addition to stating their general support for ongoing work, expressed a desire for more capacity building and a more inclusive and collaborative approach to development of WCPFC management objectives and reference points. It was acknowledged that it would take time for all parties to gain a detailed understanding of the issues."
WCPFC5,69,The Commission agreed that SC5 should convene a seminar under the Methods Working Group on technical issues associated with reference points.
WCPFC5,70,The Commission agreed that WCPFC6 should consider the possibility of holding a dedicated workshop on management objectives in 2010.   4.4 Allocation
WCPFC5,71,"The Chair introduced a paper on allocation (WCPFC5-2008/20), reminding the Commission that this issue was raised at WCPFC3, but following limited discussion at WCPFC4, it was deferred to WCPFC5."
WCPFC5,72,"Several CCMs, including FFA members, noted that although allocation issues are important, work on these issues is not a high priority task for the Commission at present. It was considered that discussion of allocation would be best conducted as a component of an overall strategic management plan once management objectives, reference points and total allowable catch (TAC) and/or total allowable effort (TAE) are identified and agreed on by the Commission."
WCPFC5,73,"Some CCMs representing FFA members clarified that long-term management of the resources in their EEZs is now being undertaken through the VDS, and that allocations in EEZs are decided upon by the coastal States.     12"
WCPFC5,74,"The Commission agreed that consideration of allocation issues should be merged with the Commission’s consideration of management objectives and reference points. Therefore, discussions of allocation issues at WCPFC6 will be guided by the outcomes of work on reference points and management objectives by SC5 and TCC5.   4.5 Issues from the SC4 Summary Report"
WCPFC5,75,"The Chair of the SC presented the following new recommendations of SC4 with regard to key stocks of highly migratory species in the region:  a. For WCPO bigeye tuna, a minimum 30% reduction in fishing mortality from the average levels for 2003–2006 was recommended, with the goal of returning the fishing mortality rate to FMSY. Additional reductions will be required in fishing mortality in the future if assessments indicate that fishing mortality is greater than FMSY (SC4 Summary Report, para 143); b. For WCPO skipjack tuna, the high recent catches are considered to be sustainable unless recruitment falls persistently below the long-term average (SC4 Summary Report, para 150); c. For South Pacific albacore, catches should remain at current levels (SC4 Summary Report, para 154); d. For South Pacific swordfish, due to the uncertainty in the assessment, no further increase in catch or effort was recommended (SC4 Summary Report, para 161);  e. For Pacific bluefin tuna, it was recommended that there be no further increase in fishing mortality from the current level (SC4 Summary Report, para 171); and f. For North Pacific striped marlin, the fishing mortality rate should be reduced from the current level (to 2003 or before) (SC4 Summary Report, para 188)."
WCPFC5,76,"WCPFC5 adopted the recommendations of SC4 regarding bigeye tuna, skipjack tuna, South Pacific albacore, South Pacific swordfish, Pacific bluefin tuna and North Pacific striped marlin."
WCPFC5,77,"Other SC4 recommendations provided in the SC4 Summary Report and presented to WCPFC5 included:  a. Seabirds (para 213); b. Sharks (paras 215, 218 and 220); c. Small tuna on floating objects (para 223); d. Sea turtles (para 227); e. Ecological risk assessment (para 247); f. Data gaps (paras 253 and 257); g. Catch sampling (paras 264 and 265); h. Seabird mortality (para 268); i. Data elements of the Regional Observer Programme (para 272); and j. Data confidentiality, security and dissemination (paras 295 and 296)."
WCPFC5,78,"WCPFC5 adopted the recommendations of SC4 regarding bycatch mitigation and data and information, noting that several of these recommendations will be addressed in CMMs currently under discussion at WCPFC5.     13 4.6 Programme of work for the Scientific Committee in 2009, 2010 and 2011"
WCPFC5,79,"The Chair of the SC presented the recommendations of SC4 with regard to its proposed programme of work for 2009–2011 (SC4 Summary Report, paras 314–324). This programme includes:    a. The Indonesia and Philippines Data Collection Project (IPDCP); b. Publication and distribution of the Commission’s training and educational materials; c. Refinement of bigeye tuna parameters Pacific-wide: A comprehensive review and study of bigeye tuna reproductive biology; d. Regional study of the stock structure and life history characteristics of South Pacific albacore; e. Pacific-wide tagging project; f. Use underwater videos and other tools to characterize species, size composition and spatial distribution of tunas aggregating around floating objects; g. A technical workshop to consider suitability of MSY-based reference points as default limit reference points and how they may be operationalized; h. Collection and evaluation of purse-seine species composition data; and  i. North Pacific striped marlin mitigation methods."
WCPFC5,80,"The Chair noted that the proposed expenditure has grown from US$ 745,000 last year to US$ 795,000 this year, an increase of 6%. Nevertheless, this amount represents less than 0.02% of the estimated US$ 4 billion value of the fishery."
WCPFC5,81,"FFA members reiterated their concern that holding a workshop on reference points in 2009 would be premature. Therefore, in accordance with WCPFC5 agreements under Section 4.3 above, the technical workshop on reference points (g, above) will be replaced with a seminar on the same topic at SC5, and a possible workshop on management objectives in 2010."
WCPFC5,82,"PNG drew attention to its contribution of US$ 100,000 to the scientific work of the WCPFC, stating that this funding should not be used to fund work on reference points. Rather, it should be allocated to tuna tagging and to supporting SIDS participation in technical workshops."
WCPFC5,83,"In response to a question regarding item h above, in particular how the sampling objectives and designs will be determined, the Executive Director indicated that sampling at ports will be conducted in American Samoa (Pago Pago), FSM (Pohnpei), RMI (Majuro), Solomon Islands (Honiara), PNG (Wewak and Madang), Indonesia and the Philippines. John Hampton (SPC, Science Services Provider) explained that the research would focus on onboard sampling by observers, specifically to address concerns regarding purse-seine catches, which are sorted on board before transhipment."
WCPFC5,84,One CCM requested bigeye and yellowfin tuna stock assessments be conducted every year in order to support ongoing management efforts.
WCPFC5,85,"Another CCM noted with appreciation the Commission’s efforts to move toward a more strategic approach to its research planning, thereby allowing it to anticipate issues that will require focused scientific input.     14"
WCPFC5,86,WCPFC5 adopted the report of SC4 and thanked outgoing Chair Dae-Yeon Moon for his dedicated efforts to progress the work of the Scientific Committee over the past three years.   AGENDA  ITEM  5  -  NORTHERN COMMITTEE 5.1 Report of the Fourth Regular Session of the Northern Committee
WCPFC5,87,"The Chair of the Northern Committee, Masanori Miyahara (Japan), summarized the outcomes of the Fourth Regular Session of the Northern Committee (NC4), which met in Tokyo, Japan, 11–13 September 2008. NC4 considered the advice received from the 8th meeting of the ISC and the status of northern stocks. The report of the NC4 included reference to:   • the NC’s establishment of an interim management objective for North Pacific albacore;  • the NC’s recommended CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna, contingent on Korea lifting its reservation;  • the progress of the NC Working Group (WG) on striped marlin, and the NC'’ recommendations regarding the work of the WG;  • the NC’s recommendation regarding large-scale driftnets on the high seas in the Convention Area;  • the NC’s consideration of improvements to the North Pacific albacore CMM, which it plans to revisit at NC5."
WCPFC5,88,The management recommendation for North Pacific albacore is that fishing mortality should not be increased.
WCPFC5,89,"The recommendations for Pacific bluefin tuna are:    • That the current level of fishing mortality not be increased; • If fishing mortality remains at the current level and environmental conditions remain favorable, then recruitment should be sufficient to maintain current yields well into the future; and  • Increases in fishing mortality above the current level, and/or unfavorable changes in environmental conditions, may result in recruitment levels that are insufficient to sustain the current productivity of the stock."
WCPFC5,90,"Although scientific advice regarding northern striped marlin was provided to the NC by the ISC, there has not yet been a recommendation by the SC that northern striped marlin is a northern stock, therefore no management advice was proposed."
WCPFC5,91,The NC noted the importance of ensuring that any reductions on fishing effort resulting from the CMM for bigeye and yellowfin tuna not be transferred to northern stocks.
WCPFC5,92,The NC expressed its support for amending the CMM for sharks (CMM 2006-05) to apply to all vessel sizes.   15    5.2 Issues from the NC4 Report
WCPFC5,93,"The NC Chair explained that Korea had entered a reservation to the management recommendation for Pacific bluefin tuna. The reasons for this reservation have been thoroughly explored with Korea, which has indicated it has no intention to increase its effort in 2009."
WCPFC5,94,"Korea stated that it is requesting a postponement, during which it will work to improve a statistical system on the northern Pacific bluefin tuna, study the distribution of Pacific bluefin in its coastal waters, and explore mechanisms for controlling effort given existing national laws and regulations."
WCPFC5,95,"Given Korea’s reservation, the Chair of the NC suggested that Commission Members may wish to implement the recommendation on a voluntary basis and report their efforts in this regard to NC5. The recommendation can be reconsidered by NC5 and potentially developed into a draft CMM to be considered at WCPFC6. In 2009, the Chair of the NC will meet with representatives of Mexico to begin a dialogue on cooperative Pacific bluefin tuna management."
WCPFC5,96,One CCM expressed concern that the management recommendation for Pacific bluefin:  i) is not adequately precautionary; ii) is premised on an assumption that environmental conditions remain favorable; and iii) does not define current effort.
WCPFC5,97,"Gary Sakagawa, Chair of the ISC, informed the Commission that the ISC is currently holding a workshop designed to clarify points of uncertainty in the Pacific bluefin stock assessment. More informative scientific advice is expected to be available for WCPFC6."
WCPFC5,98,"Two CCMs expressed their concerns about the status of the Pacific bluefin stock, urging the ISC and the NC to work toward a revised management recommendation next year."
WCPFC5,99,"WCPFC5 agreed that CCMs are requested not to increase the level of fishing mortality on Pacific bluefin in 2009 on a voluntary basis and tasked the NC to work toward developing a draft CMM for Pacific bluefin for consideration at WCPFC6.   5.3 Programme of work for the Northern Committee in 2009, 2010, 2011"
WCPFC5,100,"The NC Chair presented the NC work programme for 2009–2011, which outlines projects under four main headings: northern stocks; non-target, associated and dependent species; review of the effectiveness of decisions; and cooperation with other organizations (Report of the NC4, Attachment L)."
WCPFC5,101,"The Chair noted that an interim management objective for North Pacific albacore was established, which states that spawning stock biomass should be maintained above the level represented by the average of the lowest 10 years in the stock’s 40-year data history. The NC plans to consider the need for management action in 2009, and anticipates a new stock assessment from the ISC in 2010."
WCPFC5,102,The work programme for Pacific bluefin tuna is referred to in Section 5.2 above.  16
WCPFC5,103,A stock assessment for North Pacific swordfish is expected in 2009.
WCPFC5,104,One CCM expressed concern that the interim management objective for North Pacific albacore is not sufficiently precautionary. Clarification was requested as to how this objective relates to levels of un-fished biomass.
WCPFC5,105,Representatives of the NC and the ISC responded that the interim management objective is simply designed to prevent the stock from falling below its lowest documented levels. Work to develop more permanent fisheries management reference points is ongoing and will inform future evaluation of stock status and formulation of conservation and management recommendations.
WCPFC5,106,"The issue of the NC’s inability to propose a management measure for North Pacific striped marlin in the absence of its designation as a northern stock was raised. However, it was noted that a North Pacific striped marlin management recommendation was agreed on as part of the adoption of the report of SC4."
WCPFC5,107,WCPFC adopted the NC4 Summary Report.    AGENDA  ITEM  6  -  TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE 6.1 Report of the Fourth Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee
WCPFC5,108,"Wendell Sanford (Canada), Chair of the TCC, presented the outcomes of TCC4, which was held in Pohnpei, FSN, 2–7 October 2008. The following recommendations from the TCC4 Summary Report were adopted by the Commission:    a. TCC4 recommended to the Intersessional Working Group on the Regional Observer Programme (IWG-ROP) that crew nationality was not an essential data field, but that verification of fish hold capacity should be included as a data field for the ROP  (para 15);   b. TCC4 recommended that the Commission approve the collection of data listed in Attachment C to the TCC4 report (para 23).   c. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that the mandate of the IWG-ROP be extended for a period of one year (para 34). d. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that it authorize the IWG-ROP to continue its work on outstanding items contained in CMM 2006-07, a non-exhaustive list of which is attached at Attachment D to the TCC4 Summary Report (para 35).   e. TCC4 recommended that the Secretariats of the WCPFC and FFA enter into discussions with a view to preparing a draft VMS service level agreement for consideration by the Commission at WCPFC5 (para 40).   f. With respect to costs for the Commission VMS, TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that CCMs will assume costs for their vessels. Costs for Secretariat operations of the Commission VMS will be borne by the Commission budget (para 56).   g. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that the activation date for the WCPFC VMS be 1 April 2009 (para 58).    17 h. Regarding TCC4’s discussions of para 3(j) of CMM-2007-03, the majority favored retaining this paragraph while the minority favored its removal. CCMs agreed to recommend to the Commission not to apply para 3(j) of CMM-2007-03 as a criterion for IUU listing in developing the Draft IUU Vessel List in 2009. During this period, the Secretariat, in consultation with interested CCMs, will develop additional procedures to give effect to this paragraph for discussion at TCC5 (para 115).    i. TCC4 recommended participation of CCMs and the WCPFC Secretariat in the Second Meeting of International Tuna RFMOs (para 118).   j. TCC4 recommended consideration of IUU lists developed in other RFMOs as a criterion in the development of the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. In doing so, WCPFC should take into account the processes used within other RFMOs and characteristics of the area for IUU listing (para 119).  k. TCC4 noted that in the future, the development and implementation of a measure in this Commission might be required to sanction CCMs that frequently have their vessels nominated for IUU listing, especially if any CCM fails to effectively monitor, control and sanction offending vessels and vessel operators. Noting this point, TCC4 suggested that any potential measure should take into account actions taken to impose sanctions in other RFMOs. TCC4 recommended that this issue be taken up by the Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures (CCMM) Working Group facilitated by Australia (para 121–123).   l. TCC4 recommended that WCPFC5 agree that for the purpose of the High Seas Boarding and Inspection Procedures, CCMs shall provide to the Secretariat the contact information for the authorities of their fishing vessels (para 167).   m. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that the Secretariat, in consultation with CCMs, develop a web-based system for vessel record information (para 172).   n. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that the exemption for non-CCM carrier and bunker vessels be extended for a further year (para 175).    o. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that, depending on the response [of CCMs to a call to bring their reporting up to date in advance of WCPFC5] the Commission may wish to consider remedial action, including sanctions, for failure to comply (para 209).   p. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that [the TCC4] budget and work plan be approved (para 234).   q. TCC4 recommended deferral of the issue of port State measures for WCPFC until conclusion of the FAO process (para 246). r. TCC4 recommended to WCPFC5 that it should clarify that with respect to the seabird CMM, different measures must be taken from each column [of CMM 2007-04, Table 1: Mitigation Measures (for seabirds)] when weighted branch lines are under consideration (para 275). s. TCC4 discussed the technical specifications for seabird mitigation measures provided as Attachment O, Annex 1 and recommended to WCPFC5 that further review of these specifications should take place at SC5 and TCC5, drawing on the most recent decision by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) on this matter (para 276)."
WCPFC5,109,"In response to a question regarding high seas boarding and inspection procedures, it was clarified that under para 6 of CMM 2006-08, these procedures apply between a Contracting Party and a Fishing Entity subject to a notification to that effect to the  18 Commission from the Contracting Party concerned. With regard to Chinese Taipei, the Secretariat reported receiving such notifications from New Zealand and Cook Islands."
WCPFC5,110,"Regarding the extension of the exemption for non-CCM carrier and bunker vessels for another year (item n above), FFA members stated that in some cases, such vessels are vital for continued operation of the fishery and that a more considered solution to this ongoing problem should be made a priority work item for TCC5."
WCPFC5,111,"It was noted that in order to be consistent with the respective roles and responsibilities of TCC4 and WCPFC5, the recommendation in paras 275 and 276 of the TCC4 report should read “recommended to WCPFC5”.  These changes have been incorporated into items r and s above.   6.2 VMS standards, specifications and procedures"
WCPFC5,112,"The Chair of the TCC presented the latest draft of the WCPFC VMS standards, specifications and procedures (SSPs) produced by TCC4 (WCPFC5-2008/16 Suppl.). Although the TCC4 draft was nearly complete, agreement was not reached on text in paras 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 7.3.6."
WCPFC5,113,"In response to comments from Chinese Taipei (WCPFC5-2008/DP-25) with respect to the application of procedures to contact vessels that fail to report at agreed intervals, it was agreed that the WCPFC Secretariat and the flag State will use all practical means, including radio from and to the flag State, to re-establish and maintain contact with the vessel in question."
WCPFC5,114,"In discussion of the text in para 5.3 of the SSPs, one CCM suggested that “before entry” be replaced with “upon entry” and “high seas of the” be inserted before “Convention Area is exited” in the second sentence."
WCPFC5,115,"Despite lengthy discussion, agreement on paras 5.4 and 5.5 of the SSPs could not be reached. CCMs’ views ranged from a desire to allow 30 days for re-establishing the functioning of a vessel’s automatic location communicator (ALC) with an 8-hour interim manual reporting interval in para 5.4 (15 days and 8 hours in para 5.5), to immediate return to port in the event of ALC malfunction with manual reporting every hour. Arguments were also made for a 10-day re-establishment limit with 4-hour manual reporting intervals. It was stated that other RFMOs have re-establishment limits of 30–60 days and that the FFA VMS requires manual reporting at 4-hour intervals."
WCPFC5,116,"It was observed that based on a minimum number of reporting vessels (e.g. 200 vessels), 216,000 polls would be expected per year, with the number of missed polls expected to be 21 given a failure rate of 1:10,000. A considerably larger number of missed polls during the initial months of Commission VMS operation will perhaps indicate a need to re-visit discussions surrounding the bracketed text in paras 5.4 and 5.5 of the SSPs."
WCPFC5,117,"In discussion of para 7.3.6 of the SSPs, one CCM considered that this text would be more appropriately placed in the Rules and Procedures for Protection, Access to and Dissemination of Data. It was agreed that this text would be considered for inclusion in the Rules and Procedures for Protection, Access to and Dissemination of Data but unless and until incorporated therein, the text should remain in the VMS SSPs.     19"
WCPFC5,118,WCPFC5 adopted the VMS SSPs produced by TCC4 with agreed amendments to paras 5.3 and 7.3.6. WCPFC5 recommended that CCMs work to resolve issues relating to bracketed text in paras 5.4 and 5.5 of the VMS SSPs prior to TCC5.   6.3 Draft FFA/WCPFC VMS Service Level Agreement
WCPFC5,119,"The Executive Director presented the draft Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the FFA and WCPFC Secretariats to support implementation of the VMS (WCPFC5-2008/16 Suppl., Attachment B).  This was prepared subsequent to discussions at TCC4 with the assistance of FFA.  WCPFC5’s attention was drawn to Schedule 2, which provides a description of services, and Schedule 3, which contains payments and charges. It was highlighted that selection of the Pacific VMS option by WCPFC4 avoids substantial capital costs. The current estimate of total costs per vessel per month is approximately US$ 28. Charges associated with Communication Service Providers (Iridium, Inmarsat-C, Argos) can not yet be precisely estimated. However, assuming that 150 vessels report directly to the Commission in the first year (plus an additional 450 vessels reporting through FFA); reporting every four hours at a cost of five cents per report; and polling once per week, costs will be on the order of US$ 15 per month. In addition, as the number of vessels reporting increases, reporting costs per vessel will decrease."
WCPFC5,120,"In response to questions, the Executive Director clarified that VMS data reported from vessels on the high seas will be directly transmitted to the Commission through the Pacific VMS Data Centre and will not pass through the FFA. Also, the US$ 1,250 fee to a CCM to access its own data through the system was confirmed to be a one-time charge."
WCPFC5,121,"Two CCMs questioned whether the assumed number of vessels reporting to the Commission’s VMS was realistic, as the number of vessels could possibly be substantially higher.  These CCMs recommended budgeting for a greater number of vessels reporting in the first year."
WCPFC5,122,It was noted that the number of vessels likely to be reporting is difficult to estimate.  Assuming a low number of vessels produces a worst-case per vessel cost estimate but under-estimating the number of vessels may result in under-estimating fixed costs.
WCPFC5,123,"One CCM inquired about the incremental cost to the Commission if vessels are already reporting to the FFA. The Executive Director replied that because the FFA will not pass on the charges from the Communication Services Provider, the incremental cost should be low."
WCPFC5,124,WCPFC5 accepted the estimates of the VMS cost structure and adopted the WCPFC-FFA VMS Service Level Agreement.   6.4 Issues from the TCC4 Summary Report
WCPFC5,125,It was noted that a number of additional items discussed at TCC4 will be taken up under other agenda items in this meeting.
WCPFC5,126,"The EC provided a report on progress with developing a WCPFC Catch Documentation Scheme for bigeye tuna. After raising the issue for discussion at WCPFC4, the EC attempted to progress a draft CMM intersessionally, and discussed the issue at TCC4. The EC committed to continuing their work on this issue in 2009,  20 including the possibility of convening an intersessional workshop, perhaps in conjunction with the IWG-ROP and/or the Ad Hoc Task Group–Data.   6.5 Annual Report by CCMs (Part 1 and Part 2 Reports)"
WCPFC5,127,"The Executive Director presented a paper summarizing CCMs submission of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Annual Report to the Commission (WCPFC5-2000/IP02 (Rev.1).  As of the date of this paper, 30 Part 1 reports had been submitted to the Secretariat. It is understood that information for the three participating territories who have not submitted Part 1 reports has been provided in the Part 1 reports submitted by the USA and France. As of the date of the paper, 28 Part 2 reports had been received and one report is outstanding. CCMs were urged to adhere to the deadlines for Part 1 and Part 2 reports as receipt of these reports during or after the SC or TCC meetings hinder compilation of the submissions by the Secretariat, and effectively prevent review of the reports by other CCMs. CCMs were invited to note the summary of outstanding submissions in WCPFC5-2008/IP06, Table 3, and submit any outstanding Part 1 and Part 2 information to the Secretariat."
WCPFC5,128,"The Executive Director also presented enhanced guidelines for CCMs’ Part 2 of the Annual Report (WCPFC5-2008/IP-07, Appendix B). An example submission using the new template is attached as Appendix C to that information paper."
WCPFC5,129,"In response to a question regarding a master list of reporting deadlines, the Executive Director drew CCMs’ attention to the ongoing improvements to the Commission’s website, which will include a page showing all reporting deadlines and CCMs’ submissions to date at a glance. The Chair suggested that the Executive Director provide a reminder to all CCMs regarding the website’s new functions."
WCPFC5,130,"One CCM suggested that in order to avoid showing failure to submit a nil response (e.g. no data submitted because no fishery operated) as non-compliance, that the Secretariat notify all parties via correspondence of any non-compliances and provide an opportunity to respond."
WCPFC5,131,"WCPFC5 agreed to accept the Secretariat’s report on CCMs’ Annual Report, Part 1 and 2 submissions and adopted the enhanced guidelines for Part 2 submissions contained in WCPFC5-2008/IP-07, Appendix B. CCMs should use these guidelines for all future submissions of Part 2 reports.   6.6 Review of CCMs’ implementation and compliance with CMMs"
WCPFC5,132,"In response to a request from TCC4, the Executive Director presented, in tabular form, the compliance of individual CCMs against more than 20 CMMs (WCPFC5-2008/IP06 [Rev.1]).  This paper incorporates feedback from CCMs in response to the initial version of the paper.  Another paper (WCPFC5-2008/18) provides a descriptive overview of CMM implementation and compliance similar to that presented to the Commission in previous years. The Executive Director, on behalf of the Commission, expressed appreciation for the work of SPC data managers who handle the Commission’s data."
WCPFC5,133,"Belize noted that although the papers show three instances of non-compliance by Belize, in fact all of these data have been submitted.     21"
WCPFC5,134,FSM also noted some discrepancies between its data holdings for longline catches of bigeye tuna and data held by SPC. FSM and SPC will work to resolve these issues.
WCPFC5,135,"In order to cope with the substantial time required to track compliance issues as the number of CMMs increases, New Zealand suggested that Secretariat staffing be augmented to include an additional compliance officer. New Zealand also supported the continued provision of information like that in WCPFC5-2008/IP06 (Rev.1) as it appears to be effective in prompting additional data submissions to the Secretariat."
WCPFC5,136,"WCPFC5 noted two papers (WCPFC5-2008/18 and WCPFC5-2008/IP06.Rev.1) evaluating the compliance of CCMs with the Commission’s CMMs.   6.7 Programme of work for the Technical and Compliance Committee in 2009, 2010 and 2011"
WCPFC5,137,"WCPFC5 discussed the proposed TCC work programme for 2009-2011 contained in the TCC4 Summary Report, Attachment M."
WCPFC5,138,"In discussion, the following items were identified as priorities for the coming year (2009):    a. Finalising and implementing the regional observer programme;  b. Developing a measure on transhipment; c. Revising procedures for granting CNM status; d. Improving / elaborating IUU listing procedures;  e. Developing a measure regarding control of nationals; f. Determining a more lasting solution to the issue of non-CCM flagged carriers and bunkers; g. Developing Port State measures pursuant to the outcome of the FAO consultations; h. Developing a Catch Documentation Scheme; i. Developing a Vessel Day Scheme for the high seas; j. Defining guidelines for chartering arrangements; k. Finalizing the Rules and Procedures for the Protection, Access to and Dissemination of Data; and l. Developing a process of monitoring compliance by CCMs."
WCPFC5,139,WPCFC5 adopted the TCC4 Summary Report   6.8 WCPFC IUU Vessel List
WCPFC5,140,"In October 2008, TCC4 agreed to include the Jing Chuen No. 68 on the Provisional IUU Vessel List, noting that the vessel shall be subsequently removed from the list once France confirms that the payment of assessed fines is complete (TCC4 Summary Report, paras 94–97).  France reported to WCPFC5 that the payment is now complete (WCPFC5-2008/IP08)."
WCPFC5,141,WCPFC5 agreed by consensus not to list the Jing Chuen No. 68 on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.     22
WCPFC5,142,"The other vessel on the 2008 Provisional IUU Vessel List prepared by TCC4 is the Chu Huai No. 638, a Chinese Taipei-flagged fishing vessel originally nominated for listing by Tonga (TCC Summary Report paras 65–73)."
WCPFC5,143,Tonga reported to WCPFC5 that the case had been satisfactorily settled and thanked representatives from Chinese Taipei for their assistance in this matter. Tonga reiterated the gravity with which it treats IUU fishing incidents in its national waters.
WCPFC5,144,WCPFC5 agreed by consensus not to list the Chu Huai No. 638 on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC5,145,"With regard to two vessels placed on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List at WCPFC4, the government of Venezuela requested the WCPFC5 remove the Athena F and Daniela F from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC5,146,"Cook Islands reported that subsequent to listing of the Athena F on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List in 2007, it had received helpful and responsive cooperation from the Venezuelan government, indicating that the vessel has been prosecuted under Venezuelan law and the vessel master has been prosecuted by the vessel owner. In Cook Islands view, the applied sanctions are adequate, and Cook Islands supported Venezuela’s request to remove the Athena F from the list.  Cook Islands noted that the WCPFC IUU Vessel List is a valuable tool in assisting coastal States with large EEZs to control IUU activities."
WCPFC5,147,WCPFC5 agreed by consensus to remove the Athena F from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC5,148,"Concerning the Daniela F, France stated it had been asked by Venezuela to provide additional documentation of the violation, and France had done so but there has been no further response from Venezuela. France considers that because:  a. the infringements by the Daniela F (i.e. fishing without a license and use of purse seine gear) are serious ones, which targeted small fish and had a high potential to damage coastal resources; b. the response from Venezuela to date is insufficient; and c. the case is currently proceeding through their national judicial system;   France does not support Venezuela’s request to remove the vessel from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC5,149,"WCPFC5 did not achieve consensus on removal of the Daniela F from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List, therefore this vessel shall remain on the list."
WCPFC5,150,"Regarding another vessel placed on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List by WCPFC4, TCC4 agreed to recommend to WCPFC5 the removal of Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List if a satisfactory settlement was reached by the time WCPFC5 met."
WCPFC5,151,"Chinese Taipei explained that it has suspended the vessel’s fishing license for one year, suspended the captain’s license for one year, and required the vessel to remain in port during the course of the investigation. It has also thoroughly investigated ownership issues and found no evidence that the existing owner of the vessel has any linkage with the owner of the vessel at the time of the violation. Chinese Taipei believes that these  23 actions satisfy two (sub-paras a–c and d) of the three criteria in CMM 2007-03 para 25, and that compliance with any one of these criteria (i.e. either sub-paras a–c, or d, or e) is sufficient to support removal of this vessel."
WCPFC5,152,"FSM informed WCPFC5 that the case of the Jinn Feng Tsair No 1 is pending in FSM’s Supreme Court, and unless negotiations between involved parties result in resolution before 1 January 2009, FSM will move for summary judgement. FSM reiterated its view of the seriousness of the case, in particular that the vessel fled FSM jurisdiction and has not responded to the action taken against it in FSM courts, and has failed to settle the case through mediation.  In this sense, FSM considers that the requirement to settle the case to the satisfaction of the CCM that originally submitted the vessel for listing under CMM 2007-03, para 25e has not been met.  FSM therefore maintains that the Jinn Feng Tsair No 1 should remain on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List until the vessel submits to FSM laws and regulations."
WCPFC5,153,WCPFC5 did not achieve consensus on removal of the Jinn Feng Tsair No 1 from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. Therefore this vessel shall remain on the list.
WCPFC5,154,"The WCPFC IUU Vessel List adopted at WCPFC5 is: a. Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1, and b. Daniela F"
WCPFC5,155,Chinese Taipei argued that a sanction of effective severity has been imposed upon Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 in accordance with CMM 2007-03. Chinese Taipei argued that there is ample evidence to prove that the previous owner has no current interest or connection with that vessel and thus the Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 should be removed from the current IUU List as a matter of law.
WCPFC5,156,"Some CCMs noted that the current IUU listing procedures (CMM 2007-03) require consensus for both listing and de-listing of vessels. It was further noted that such requirements are difficult to achieve since either the flag State of the vessel nominated for listing or the coastal State nominating the vessel can unilaterally block a consensus decision. For this reason, it was suggested that the Commission specify procedures that do not allow the flag or coastal States involved in the listing case to block a consensus of the remaining CCMs."
WCPFC5,157,"Several CCMs, including FFA members, stated the view that evaluating whether an effective action has been taken by a flag State, as required by CMM 2007-03 para.15(b), is a matter for consideration of the Commission, rather than just the flag State, and that it is important that the satisfaction of the coastal State be factored into making such considerations. These CCMs suggested that the following criteria should be considered when determining whether a satisfactory settlement has been reached.  a. The potential penalties imposed by the coastal State;  b. The number of violations committed;  c. The quantity, species and value of fish taken whilst the violations were being committed;  d. The potential loss of licensing revenue incurred;  e. The cost for carrying out monitoring, control and surveillance activities to detect the violation; f. The cost of the investigation of the IUU matter;  24 g. The ongoing cost of sending staff to WCPFC meetings to ensure that the vessel is placed on the IUU list; and h. The need to set a penalty that acts as an effective deterrent so as to secure compliance with coastal State laws and WCPFC measures."
WCPFC5,158,"Some CCMs advised against formalizing provisions for mandatory involvement of the flag State in settlements, warning that such provisions could lead to double punishment of the vessel.  It was also noted, however, that there are practical reasons why the flag State may be best placed to prosecute the vessel (e.g. when the vessel has fled the waters where the violation occurred)."
WCPFC5,159,"Other CCMs stated the importance of requiring a settlement that is satisfactory to the coastal State whose resources were damaged by the violation, and urged that coastal State settlement take priority over a settlement imposed by the flag State. These CCMs noted that it would be unfair for the flag State to benefit (e.g. receive fines) when its vessels engage in IUU fishing activities, yet the coastal State where the violation occurs receives nothing."
WCPFC5,160,"Some CCMs suggested that in the first instance, and unless extenuating circumstances exist, settlement of IUU fishing incidents between the offending vessel and the coastal State should be given precedence."
WCPFC5,161,"WCPFC5 agreed that further development of guidelines for how the Commission should consider and assess the adequacy of any actions taken, or sanctions imposed, in relation to CMM 2007-03 should be a priority work item and referred the matter to TCC5. It was noted that work on a control of national measures may inform this process.     AGENDA  ITEM  7  -  CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES 7.1 Bigeye and yellowfin a. Presentation from industry"
WCPFC5,162,"Michael McGowan (Bumble Bee Foods) made a presentation entitled “Market and Cannery Overview”. Global catch increased rapidly through the late 1990s but has since flattened out. Growth in global catch of tuna has been driven by catches in the WCPFC Statistical Area.  Estimates of world population growth will continue to place pressure on world fish supplies.  Even with aquaculture, supply will not be able to keep pace with demand. Increases in tuna supply have supported the development of a global market for canned tuna, with revenues estimated at about US$ 7.5 billion. Global processing tends to be aligned around key tuna fishing grounds near the equator. Tariff structures and labor rates are also key factors. There are about 56 tuna processing facilities that rely predominantly on the WCPFC fishery, and about 36 processing facilities that rely predominantly on the eastern Pacific fishery, with production at about one-half the WCPFC level. There are a smaller number of Indian Ocean processing facilities with annual production estimated at about 272,000 tons. Most of the Atlantic production capacity is in Spain and western Africa. Skipjack prices have shown a steady increase over recent years as demand has outpaced supply. Between January 2007 and March 2008, eastern Pacific prices were significantly above western Pacific prices, reflecting  25 fishery closures and a strong Euro. The effect of escalating skipjack prices is lower demand and a shift to higher quality, value added products. Going forward, skipjack prices are expected to remain firm as demand outpaces supply.  Sustainable fisheries management will be a key challenge.   b. Parties to the Nauru Agreement Report: Implementation of VDS"
WCPFC5,163,"The Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) presented a paper on implementing the VDS (WCPFC5-2008/25). As this is the first year of the scheme, issues with implementing it are expected to arise and will be handled in order to allow the VDS to operate effectively. Effort is being limited to 2004 levels according to CMM 2005-01, with a provision to allow transfer of days between PNA members. For these limits to be effective in reducing fishing mortality on the stocks, it will be important for the Commission to adopt compatible measures for high seas areas and other areas not covered by the Third Implementing Arrangement of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement."
WCPFC5,164,"Attention was also drawn to WCPFC5-2008/18 Attachment 1, Table 1, which presents a summary of purse-seine effort for individual PNA member countries, similar to tables presented previously but with a new format showing effort for individual PNA member countries, effort in archipelagic waters and effort by PNA domestic vessels."
WCPFC5,165,One CCM noted that the VDS is an important step in controlling overall fishing effort on bigeye tuna and expressed its intention to cooperate with PNA members on VDS implementation through bilateral agreements.    c. Compatibility: High Seas VDS
WCPFC5,166,"WCPFC4 tasked the Executive Director to commence a process to support the adoption of measures similar to the VDS to limit purse-seine effort on the high seas, consistent with para 9 of CMM 2005-01, and in waters under the national jurisdiction of non-PNA members of the Commission, consistent with para 10(ii) of CMM-2005-01. WCPFC5-2008/13 presents several options for managing purse-seine effort on the high seas, noting that access to the high seas pockets can be, and in some cases already is, controlled through EEZ access agreements with PNA members."
WCPFC5,167,FFA members noted their support for a high seas VDS and the establishment of compatible arrangements for controlling purse-seine effort. These members suggested that the issue be referred to SC5 and TCC5 for further consideration.
WCPFC5,168,The Commission agreed to refer the issue of a high seas VDS to SC5 and TCC5 for further discussion.
WCPFC5,169,The Commission encouraged CCMs to provide comments on the recommendations contained in WCPFC5-2008/13 to the Secretariat prior to SC5.
WCPFC5,170,The Commission agreed to designate the issue of a high seas VDS as a high priority issue for consideration at WCPFC6.    26  d. Draft CMM for bigeye and yellowfin
WCPFC5,171,"The Chair of the Commission introduced his draft measure for the conservation and management of bigeye and yellowfin tuna (WCPFC5-2008/DP-01), reiterating that he considered agreement on such a measure to be the top priority for WCPFC5. Many other CCMs also stated that this issue was their key concern for the meeting."
WCPFC5,172,"John Hampton (SPC-OFP) summarized the results of the 2008 stock assessment for WCPO bigeye tuna and 2007 stock assessment for yellowfin tuna, with respect to the evaluation of management options. The latest stock assessment for WCPO bigeye tuna (2008) indicates that overfishing is occurring and there is a possibility that the stock is overfished. Historically, catches have been dominated by the longline fishery but some juveniles are taken by purse-seine fisheries, particularly those on floating objects. The recommendations from SC4 are to reduce fishing mortality by 30%. In order to achieve this, reductions will be necessary across a range of fisheries.  While reducing fishing mortality by longlines will have the greatest effect, with the rapid increase in purse-seine fisheries, particularly in Indonesia and the Philippines, reductions will also be needed in purse-seine fisheries."
WCPFC5,173,"Regarding yellowfin tuna, John Hampton explained that the latest stock assessment (2007) indicates there is a possibility that the stock is being subject to overfishing but the probability that the stock is in an overfished state is low. Even though effort and efficiency have increased, catch levels have remained relatively constant since the early 1990s, signalling that a limit has probably been reached. Yellowfin spawning stock biomass depletion is attributed primarily to catches of small individuals by the domestic purse-seine fisheries (both associated and unassociated sets) in the Philippines and Indonesia. The impact of longline fisheries on yellowfin tuna is considered to be modest."
WCPFC5,174,"Martin Tsamenyi provided an introduction to WCPFC5’s consideration of compatibility issues. Article 8 of the Convention requires that “conservation and management measures established for the high seas and those adopted for areas under national jurisdiction shall be compatible in order to ensure conservation and management of highly migratory stocks in their entirety”. In his presentation, Tsamenyi considered that, because the term “areas under national jurisdiction” is not defined in the Convention or UNFSA, that the Rules of Treaty interpretation under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties may provide for this term to be  interpreted in several ways, including: i)  literally to include the EEZ, territorial sea, archipelagic waters and internal waters; and ii) in the context of the fisheries provisions under the 1982 Convention to refer only to the EEZ.  Tsamenyi noted that consistent with the objective to manage the stocks in their entirety, Commission Members are obliged to seek a cooperative approach to the requirement under the Convention for compatibility of measures between the high seas and areas under national jurisdiction. In the discussion that followed, it was apparent that there were many differences of view among Members as to how the term “areas under national jurisdiction” should be interpreted and applied with respect to implementation of the WCPF Convention. The issue will require further consideration and clarification among Members."
WCPFC5,175,"With the permission of the Chair, Japan made a presentation describing their port sampling programme for purse-seine landings. Because Japanese regulations prohibit transhipment at sea from purse seiners, almost all purse-seine catches are landed  27 domestically. Due to market requirements, all landed fish are sorted by species and size category. Japan believes that this situation represents an opportunity for purse-seine catch monitoring."
WCPFC5,176,"Extensive discussion of the proposed bigeye and yellowfin CMM continued throughout WCPFC5, resulting in the circulation of several new drafts by the Chair, with the assistance of Australia, information papers from the Science Services Provider, and delegation papers by CCMs. Major issues raised and debated by CCMs during these discussions included, inter alia: a. Relative reductions in fishing mortality in purse-seine versus longline fisheries, given that a balance was desirable but some CCMs considered that their purse-seine fisheries had a minimal effect on bigeye stocks; b. Whether the proposed measure would provide for measurable and credible conservation benefits, an equitable conservation burden among CCMs, effective implementation and monitoring, and an ability to evaluate and adjust controls; c. The potential for flexibility in implementation, for example, by area or time period, or the possibility to trade reductions between different fisheries under the same flag; d. The potential for phased implementation of the measure over the proposed three-year timeframe; e. Whether the measure as drafted was sufficiently precautionary given the SC’s recommendation to reduce fishing mortality for bigeye tuna by 30%, and whether it was likely to achieve the desired result; f. Whether explicit provisions should be included for yellowfin tuna or whether by achieving reductions in fishing mortality for bigeye, that yellowfin would necessarily benefit as well; g. Whether it would be more practical and effective to mandate a closure of fish aggregating device (FAD) fisheries or a total closure of all purse seine operations, and the duration and locations of such closures; h. The importance of clearly reflecting and maintaining the limits on fishing effort specified by CMM 2005-01;  i. The geographic applicability of the measures (i.e. their applicability to archipelagic waters and territorial seas, and to areas of the far western Pacific);   j. The desirability of closing the high seas pockets between the EEZs of PNA member States and the relationship between such a closure and the development of a high seas VDS; k. The potential to consider exemptions from the measures on the basis of economic impacts either to SIDS, other developing States or developed States;  l. Ways of avoiding displacement of effort to other areas during times of proposed closures; m. Necessary levels of observer coverage; n. Options for different management measures in 2009 and 2010–2011 (before and after the Third Implementation Arrangement for the Parties to the Nauru Agreement goes into effect on 1 January 2010);  o. The growing contrast between flag-based and zone-based catch and effort limits; and p.  The measures for the purse-seine, longline and other fisheries shall be reviewed annually to assess whether it would provide an equitable conservation burden among fisheries and to consider whether equitable  28 contributions to the Commission’s conservation goals are achieved by these fisheries."
WCPFC5,177, WCPFC5 adopted a conservation and management measure for bigeye and yellowfin tuna in the WCPO by consensus (Attachment R).
WCPFC5,178,"New Zealand and other FFA members requested that the meeting record clearly specify that SIDS are exempt from the effort limits imposed by CMM 2005-01, and there is no requirement on SIDS to submit development plans."
WCPFC5,179,"RMI asked that the meeting record reflect that Attachment F to the adopted CMM 2008-01 consists of provisional data, and will be revised through cooperative efforts between the Executive Director and CCMs."
WCPFC5,180,USA wanted the record to note that the effort limits referenced by the adopted CMM 2008-01 are found in Attachment F of CMM 2008-01 in the column labelled as “Av. 2001-04 or 2004*”.
WCPFC5,181,RMI requested that the following footnotes be added to Attachment B of CMM 2008-01:  a. “the column labelled as CMM 2005-01 does not take into account para 6 and footnote 1 of CMM 2005-01.”   b. “the column labelled as CMM 2006-01 does not take into account para 6 and footnote 1 of CMM 2005-01.”
WCPFC5,182," Japan asked that the meeting record reflect the fact that, pursuant to para 15 of the adopted CMM 2008-01, Japan has been identified by the Commission as having the capacity to implement a 10% reduction in purse-seine catches through Member-specific catch limits as an alternative to a high seas FAD closure. The Chair noted that, in order for this to happen, it was now incumbent upon Japan to submit the full details of its intended measures, 2001–2004 operational catch and effort data, and its port monitoring programme to the Commission by 31 January 2009, as required by para 16 of the CMM 2008-01."
WCPFC5,183,"Chinese Taipei indicated that the number of purse seiners in its fleet is 34 rather than 33 as shown in Schedule 7, Attachment C of Attachment R of CMM 2008-01."
WCPFC5,184,"Indonesia read a statement provided as Attachment S to this Summary Report emphazing the need for the Commission to incorporate needs for environmental services into its CMMs and to develop such mechanisms in order to ensure that the benefit of its application will be distributed in a fair and equitable manner, taking into consideration the special characteristics of the coastal State which provide a conducive and dynamic environment for juvenile tuna to grow.   7.2 Transhipment"
WCPFC5,185,"RMI summarized its progress on a draft CMM on transhipment (WCPFC5-2008/DP-02 (Rev 2). The objective of the draft measure presented is to allow transhipment on the high seas in cases where it would be impractical to conduct operations without transhipment. Under the draft measure, CCMs would make such determinations using guidelines developed by the Secretariat and approved by the  29 Commission, and these determinations would be reviewed by the Commission. Provisions for observer coverage, accounting for more stringent national laws, prohibition of transhipment at sea by purse-seine vessels unless exempted by the measures, and reporting requirements for transhipment outside of the Convention Area of WCPO-caught fish are also included in the draft measure."
WCPFC5,186,"During an initial discussion, some CCMs posed questions on the proposed measure, including WCPFC competency to require documentation of transhipment outside the Convention Area; the differing responsibilities of flag and chartering States; provisions for longline transhipment; the application of certain provisions of the measure only to those areas between 20oN and 20oS; and the relationship between this measure and port State controls. Some of these CCMs referred to transhipment procedures in other RFMOs, such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and IOTC, and cited the need for consistency."
WCPFC5,187,"Other CCMs expressed a preference for a total ban on high seas transhipments, citing the potential complexity of implementing and enforcing the proposed measure. It was noted that ICCAT recently adopted a total ban on at sea transhipment of bluefin tuna for both longliners and purse seiners."
WCPFC5,188,"One CCM highlighted the importance of elaborating procedures for controlling and/or sanctioning carrier vessels which may be facilitating IUU fishing, thereby addressing the issue in a vessel-specific manner."
WCPFC5,189,"The draft measure was further discussed in a small working group (SWG) led by the RMI.  However, after several sessions, this SWG remained unable to achieve consensus on aspects of the proposal that placed any restrictions on currently allowable transhipment activities. As a result, the agreed provisions of the measure were considered an insufficient basis for a new CMM."
WCPFC5,190,"Acknowledging that a CMM on transhipment had been one of the top priorities for this meeting, WCPFC5 requested RMI to continue to lead development of a draft CMM, based on the progress achieved at WCPFC5 (WCPFC5-2008/DP02 [Rev. 3], Attachment T) with the objective of discussing a new draft as a priority issue at TCC5."
WCPFC5,191,"As noted in para 108 (n) of this report, WCPFC5 extended the exemption for non-CCM carrier and bunker vessels for another year, however, it was agreed that it would be critical to adopt a transhipment measure at WCPFC6, as it would be unacceptable to further extend the exemption currently in place.   7.3 Cooperating Non-member application process"
WCPFC5,192,Sylvie LaPointe (Canada) presented a paper providing a draft measure concerning applications for CNM status designed to replace CMM 2004-02 (WCPFC5-2008/DP-03).  It was explained that the draft measure’s new features included:  four criteria for evaluating applications; a mechanism by which the recommendations from TCC’s review of the application are communicated to applicants to allow them to submit other information; a caution against contributing to overcapacity; provisions from the UNFSA for granting participatory rights; and an invitation for CNMs to make a financial contribution to the work of the Commission.     30
WCPFC5,193,"FFA members stated that while some CNM applicants have interpreted CMM 2004-02 to confer a right to become a full member, FFA members do not accept this interpretation. FFA members tabled a revised version of a draft measure (WCPFC5-2008/DP-03 [Rev.1])."
WCPFC5,194,"In response to a question, it was clarified that Canada’s draft measure did not include any special provisions for taking account of the beneficial owners of the CNM applicant’s flagged vessels."
WCPFC5,195,Some CCMs raised points regarding how to handle applicants which are actively fishing in the Convention Area versus those which have only historical fishing operations.
WCPFC5,196,Some CCMs stated that CNM applicants should not be held to a higher standard than those to which members are held.
WCPFC5,197,It was suggested that CNM applicants be asked to provide a statement agreeing to be subject to high seas boarding and inspection procedures in order to remove any doubt regarding whether these procedures apply to CNMs as well as Members. This point was incorporated into revised text.
WCPFC5,198,"As a result of further discussions outside of plenary sessions, Canada tabled a new version of the measure as WCPFC5-2008/DP03 (Rev 2)."
WCPFC5,199,WCPFC5 adopted WCPFC5-2008/DP03 (Rev 2) as a CMM governing the process of considering CNM applications from 2009 onward (Attachment U).
WCPFC5,200,"As a follow-on comment to adopt the measure, one CCM noted that the flowchart based on CMM 2004-02, developed by TCC4 (TCC4 Summary Report, Attachment I), and used at WCPFC5 to evaluate applications for CNM status, was helpful. It was therefore suggested that this type of flowchart be amended to reflect the processes contained in the new measure and incorporated into the measure itself."
WCPFC5,201,WCPFC5 agreed that incorporating a flowchart illustrating the process into the new measure on CNM applications would be useful and referred the matter to TCC5 for action.   7.4 Process for monitoring compliance
WCPFC5,202,"Australia presented a proposal (WCPFC5-2008/DP-09) for the development of a WCPFC scheme for monitoring compliance with CMMs. The paper, which was prepared in response to a recommendation to the Commission from TCC4 to develop a compliance monitoring scheme, includes objectives and a structure for the scheme; information, process and response components of the scheme; a comparison with current practices in other RFMOs; and draft terms of reference for a Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures (CCMM) Working Group.  Australia suggested that this issue be progressed intersessionally, using email and/or fax, with a goal of conducting a more developed discussion of the topic at TCC5."
WCPFC5,203,"Some CCMs, including FFA members, stressed the importance of holding CCMs accountable for their compliance records and for developing mechanisms to resolve non-compliance issues beyond that provided by the IUU Vessel Listing process. These CCMs thus strongly supported the formation of a CCMM working group.    31"
WCPFC5,204,Other CCMs were not comfortable with the terms of reference currently proposed for the group. Key concerns included the large amount of additional resources likely to be necessary to support the new working group as well as the potential for it to duplicate some of the work of the TCC.
WCPFC5,205,"Some CCMs also stressed the importance of having the Secretariat notify CMMs of non-compliances and allowing for a response before listing any CCM as non-compliant. It was therefore agreed that the WCPFC Secretariat, pending the adoption of a proper compliance review within the organization, through official correspondence, should notify CCMs of any instances of non-compliance requesting a swift follow up by the concerned CCM."
WCPFC5,206,There was some support expressed for developing a compliance process that not only provides for punitive measures but also includes incentives for compliance. It was noted that the latter will be particularly important to acknowledge incremental improvements in reporting and compliance by less developed CCMs.
WCPFC5,207,"Following up on an offer made at TCC4, New Zealand undertook to complete a legal analysis of issues associated with compliance with measures, and make this available to any inter-sessional working group convened to further consider the matter of compliance monitoring by mid-February."
WCPFC5,208,"Australia convened a small working group which discussed the terms of reference for the proposed CCMM working group, but did not reach consensus (WCPFC-2008/DP38)."
WCPFC5,209,WCPFC5 agreed that further discussions of the terms of reference for a CCMM working group would occur through electronic means with a view toward holding more focused discussions on the topic at TCC5.   7.5 SIDS’ aspirations
WCPFC5,210,RMI delivered a statement (Attachment V) to introduce and present WCPFC5-2008/DP-05 on the aspirations of SIDS. The paper states that there are recurring difficulties in the development of SIDS’ fishing fleets and that some Commission Members are not cooperating in the provision of development assistance. It also calls for a reduction in the sizes of fleets from distant water fishing nations fishing in the Convention Area in order to realize fishing capacity and allow SIDS development aspirations to be acknowledged and fulfilled. It was noted that the paper could be adopted as a Commission resolution.
WCPFC5,211,Several FFA members voiced strong support for the ideas contained in the paper and the presentation. A request was made to include discussion of how implementation of Commission CMMs is impacting SIDS development aspirations as a standing item on the Commission meeting’s agenda.
WCPFC5,212,"Some CCMs, speaking in support of the resolution, suggested that its scope could be broadened to include participating territories and other developing States.     32"
WCPFC5,213,"Another CCM, also speaking in support of the resolution, noted inconsistencies in the phrasing regarding compatible measures, and suggested that this phrasing be aligned with Article 8, para 1 of the Convention."
WCPFC5,214,"Some CCMs, while supportive of the ideas in the paper, were troubled by the proposal that by 2018, SIDS could account for 70% of all highly migratory fish caught in the Convention Area, since some of these CCMs also have traditional fisheries or aspirations in their coastal zones. In this regard, it was suggested that the reference to 70% catch in the “Convention Area” either be changed to the “FFA area” or to “a greater share of the benefit than currently realized”. It was also noted the provision as currently phrased would likely be difficult to implement by the Commission even though it could be recognized as an aspiration."
WCPFC5,215,"The text was subject to extensive discussions in a small working group convened by RMI, ultimately resulting in WCPFC5-2008/DP05 (Rev. 8)."
WCPFC5,216,WCPFC5 adopted the Resolution on Aspirations of Small Island Developing States and Territories (Attachment W).
WCPFC5,217,"The Chair noted his surprise that the intention of the decision in relation to the acquisition and construction of vessels in Chinese Taipei for RMI and Tuvalu raised at the Commission meeting in 2007 had not been resolved. In his brief remarks on the issue, the Chair made reference to the current situation involving procurement of purse-seine vessels from Chinese Taipei by developed CCMs, and the inability of developing CCMs, in particular SIDS, to do the same. The Chair further noted the clear lack of fairness and disproportionate burden associated with the current situation and the difficulties for SIDS to effectively develop their domestic fisheries. While it is not the intent of the 2007 decision to increase capacity in the fishery it is also not the intent to limit SIDS to have to purchase existing second hand capacity belonging to other CCMs for their domestic fisheries development.   7.6 Sea turtles"
WCPFC5,218,"USA presented a proposal for a CMM for sea turtles (WCPFC5-2008/DP08). It was noted that this proposal has been coordinated with the SC and TCC, and is supported by the results of scientific studies in the WCPO, but that there may remain some uncertainty about the specific mitigation measures required for shallow sets in longline fisheries by some CCMs."
WCPFC5,219,"One CCM supported adoption of the text as a CMM without the specified mitigation measures, citing scientific papers questioning the effectiveness of circle hooks in mitigating sea turtle bycatch. As these studies were unfamiliar to several CCMs, it was requested that they be made available to the meeting."
WCPFC5,220,"Most other CCMs supported adoption of the text, including the mitigation measures, but requesting further details on these measures, such as the specifications of the gear and bait, educational materials for fishermen, and the ability to submit a mitigation plan for SC and TCC review in lieu of the use of circle hooks or whole finfish as bait."
WCPFC5,221,"In response to a comment regarding its practicality, the requirement to report sightings of sea turtles to the relevant authority of each CCM was removed from the text.    33"
WCPFC5,222,"Consultation on the draft text continued in the margins of the meeting and in a small working group chaired by USA, resulting in a revised draft measure (WCPFC5-2008/DP08 (Rev 2). This revision addressed three key points of concern as follows:  a. For shallow-set swordfish fisheries, providing for the use of any other measure, for submission of a mitigation plan or activity capable of reducing sea turtle interactions, that has been reviewed by SC and TCC and approved by the Commission, in lieu of the use of circle hooks or whole finfish for bait; b. For shallow-set swordfish fisheries, providing an exemption from the use of circle hooks, live bait or provision of mitigation plan if the SC determines such fisheries have a minimal observed sea turtle interaction rate over a three-year period (to be determined by SC5), and at least 10% observer coverage during each of those three years; c. Inclusion of a statement clarifying that nothing in the measure prejudices the sovereign rights of coastal States including the right to pursue traditional fishing activities."
WCPFC5,223,"WCPFC5 adopted the text of WCPFC5-2008/DP08 (Rev 2) as a CMM for sea turtles, noting that a definition of “minimal” observed interaction rates of sea turtles (para 7b) is to be determined by SC5 (Attachment X) ."
WCPFC5,224,"After adoption of the measure, the EC clarified its position on sea turtles and circle hooks for the record. The EC remains unconvinced of the effectiveness of circle hooks in reducing sea turtle interactions, citing a lack of scientific evidence. For this reason, the EC does not consider that the adoption of this CMM for sea turtles should set any precedent for similar measures in other RFMOs."
WCPFC5,225,"Other CCMs expressed their disagreement with this position, stating that there is ample scientific evidence of the effectiveness of circle hooks in the WCPO, and that such evidence has been reviewed by the SC and TCC, both of which recommend their use."
WCPFC5,226,"Australia made an additional point regarding the procedures for exercising the provisions in para 7.a.iii of the measure regarding mitigation plans. While Australia fully supports the intent of the measure and welcomes its prompt implementation on 1 January 2010, it noted with concern that this date is only a few weeks after the close of WCPFC6. Therefore, if changes are required to a mitigation plan presented by Australia to WCPFC6, Australia requested a grace period of six months to address practical issues involved in implementation before achieving full compliance.   7.7 Driftnets"
WCPFC5,227,"The USA introduced a draft CMM prohibiting the use of large-scale driftnets on the high seas in the WCPF Convention Area (WCPFC5-2008/IP-07). It was noted that such gear is subject to a global moratorium on the high seas, and that its use may undermine the Commission’s CMMs."
WCPFC5,228,"In response to a comment on the draft, it was agreed to remove the phrase “within areas under their national jurisdiction” so as to allow for a potentially broader application of more stringent measures by CCMs, such as those already in place to implement the Wellington Convention.    34"
WCPFC5,229,"The Commission encouraged NC5 to begin establishing a cooperative framework with the North Pacific Anadromous Fisheries Commission (NPAFC) and initiate, as soon as possible, a process to exchange information on North Pacific large-scale driftnet fishing activities between NPAFC and WCPFC members."
WCPFC5,230,WCPFC5 adopted WCPFC5-2008/IP07 (Rev. 1) as a new CMM restricting the possession of large-scale driftnets and prohibiting their use on the high seas of the Convention Area (Attachment Y).   7.8   Swordfish
WCPFC5,231," New Zealand introduced a draft measure (WCPFC5-2008/DP-04) designed to replace CMM 2006-03 for swordfish. The draft measure is based on the results of a stock assessment undertaken for swordfish in the southwest Pacific, and presented to SC4. Although the assessment did not indicate that overfishing is occurring or that the stock is in an overfished state, there was considerable uncertainty in the assessment due to data quality concerns. In addition, although CMM 2006-03 sets limits on vessel numbers, it does not restrict catch or effort, and has failed to control fishing mortality. For this reason, the draft measure incorporates the recommendations from SC4 that there be no further increase in catch or effort by limiting catches in 2009 to the maximum amount caught in any one year from 2000–2006. The measure is designed to be reviewed by WCPFC6."
WCPFC5,232,"Some Members considered that the assessment did not indicate any problem with the stock, since the stock was neither overfished nor in an overfished state. In addition, one CCM considered there was a need to ensure that the WCPFC is consistent in its management approach towards the different stocks, noting that there were tuna stocks in the WCPFC Convention Area, which were considered to be in a worse condition than the swordfish stock but for which no longline measure unfortunately was envisaged. It would therefore be unfair if additional measures would be imposed on some fleets while less restrictive measures would apply to other fleets. For those reasons, it was considered and that the current measures in place (CMM 2006-03) could be rolled over in its present format unless effective longline measures were also introduced for the stocks considered to be in a worse condition than the swordfish stock. Other developing States and participating territory CCMs expressed concerns about a rapid increase in effort and catch in the southwest Pacific swordfish which may adversely impact their development aspirations in the fishery."
WCPFC5,233,One CCM stated that the fact that a stock was not determined to be overfished or subject to overfishing was not a suitable basis for taking no management action. They noted that the objective of the Commission is for the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fish stocks and that this requires that management action is taken before stocks are overfished and is consistent with good fisheries management and the precautionary approach.
WCPFC5,234,One CCM also expressed concerns that catch limits could lead to greater discard rates.  That CCM also considered that the proposal to place a disproportionate burden on their fishing activities compared to other CCMs with high catches in earlier years would not lead to any effective catch restriction of the activities of these fleets. This was because these fleets had since restructured and reduced. Their suggestion was to continue to apply CMM 2006-03 while working to improve data and revisiting the measure in  35 2009. This CCM noted that it had faithfully maintained the vessel limits imposed by CMM 2006-03.
WCPFC5,235,"In discussions of the draft measure held in small working group sessions and otherwise in the margins of WCPFC5, it was learned that one of the CCMs fishing in this area, which is responsible for the majority of the catch, has revised its catch estimates for 2005 to be two to four times higher than the catches used in the stock assessment. According to data provided by that CCM to the Busan meeting, its catch figures for that given year were considerably higher than those figures that were available to SPC. On this basis it was also considered that the spatial extent of the stock assessment (it had been confined to the southwest Pacific) might have been able to be extended toward the EPO if better data from this CCM had been forthcoming in advance of the assessment."
WCPFC5,236,"Most CCMs believed this situation cast doubt on the stock assessment results and created an urgent need to verify the data provided by this CCM. Despite the increased uncertainty, these CCMs still believed it was necessary to limit fishing mortality on the stock due to increasing catches, reported targeting of sharks and high reported interactions with sea turtles and vulnerable seabird species such as albatrosses, in this fishery. Some of these CCMs, including SIDS such as Niue, and the participating territory, French Polynesia, expressed a strong desire for conservation and management of the stock in order to support their future development aspirations."
WCPFC5,237,"There was considerable discussion regarding the appropriate means of verifying the catch data of the CCM in question. Most CCMs stated that the original logbook and VMS data would be needed to verify the catch figures. However, the CCM responsible for reporting the data stated that such data could not be provided under its national data confidentiality policy. Several options were proposed, including the hiring of an independent reviewer to inspect the data in situ (e.g. in the lab where it is held), requesting SPC to review data or releasing data under a special data confidentiality agreement. In all cases, the CCM was still unable to guarantee that the original data could be made available."
WCPFC5,238,"While willing to submit all the necessary data required by WCPFC, 1  and pursuant to national legislation2 for verification of South Pacific swordfish catch data for 2005, this CCM also stated its view that the verification process, as proposed, was excessive, disproportionate and punitive."
WCPFC5,239,"A revised draft of the swordfish measure was tabled as WCPFC5-2008/DP04 (Rev. 1), and debate on this draft continued until the close of the meeting. In discussion of this draft, it was agreed that Annex 1 should be replaced with the original Annex 1 from WCPFC5-2008/DP04, with the addition of the annotation “bycatch” under the New Caledonia heading."
WCPFC5,240,"The CCM whose data requires verification maintained that data confidentiality rules would prevent it from sharing original logsheets and VMS records and thus it could not accept para 5 as drafted in WCPFC5-2008/DP04 (Rev. 1). Nevertheless, this CCM reiterated its willingness to submit to data verification for 2005 swordfish catch data only,                                                  1   Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission and data and information associated with CMMs and other decisions of the Commission.  2  See paragraph 64 above.    36 and agreed to provide all relevant data, including bycatch and observer reports, which can be released under its national legislation. This CCM agreed to use of the term “operational data” to characterize the nature of such data."
WCPFC5,241,"The Commission agreed that in order to reconcile significant changes in catch of swordfish south of 20°S by swordfish vessels reported to the Commission, all operational level catch and effort data, including bycatch data, for swordfish vessels flagged to the relevant CCM, shall be subject to a catch verification review funded by the CCM to whom the data relates, and carried out in 2009. The verification review will be undertaken by SPC-OFP in cooperation with the flag State’s relevant authority and in accordance with national legislation regarding confidentiality. The results of the verification review shall be reported to the SC and TCC, and taken into account by the Commission in determining any future catch limits."
WCPFC5,242,"WCPFC5 adopted the new CMM for swordfish, contained in WCPFC5-2008/DP04 (Rev. 1) as amended (Attachment Z).     7.8 Sharks"
WCPFC5,243,"The USA presented a draft CMM (WCPFC5-2008/IP06) designed to replace CMM 2006-05 on sharks. This new measure is based on the findings of SC4, which re-affirmed the shark fin to carcass ratio of 5%, and substantiated the lack of a difference in shark catches by vessels greater than and less than 24 meters in length. New elements of the measure include reference to the FAO International Plan of Action – Sharks (IPOA-Sharks); the identification of key shark species; assistance to SIDS for data collection and implementation of the IPOA-Sharks; reporting on implementation of the CMM in CCMs’ Annual Reports to the Commission; cooperation with IATTC on shark stock status; application of the measure to all vessels regardless of size; and reflection of concerns about artisanal and subsistence fisheries."
WCPFC5,244,One CCM asked that more specific guidance be provided on which part of the Annual Report should be used to report shark data.
WCPFC5,245,"PNG, on behalf of FFA members, spoke in favor of the measure, but requested more explicit references to traditional fishing activities and asked that references to the “WCPFC Convention Area” be modified to read “high seas and EEZs”.  PNG also suggested that blue, shortfin mako, oceanic whitetip and thresher sharks be explicitly listed as key shark species. This CCM also called for a shark stock assessment in 2010 and noted that it is the only country with a commercial shark fishery operating in its EEZ under a shark management plan."
WCPFC5,246,"Amendments to the text of the measure were made in response to PNG’s concerns. In particular, text pertaining to sovereign rights and traditional fisheries, which was included in the shark CMM, was identical to that included in the sea turtle CMM. The desirability of making use of consistent language with regard to these issues throughout Commission documents was noted."
WCPFC5,247,"WCPFC5 adopted the text of WCPFC5-2008/DP06 (Rev. 3) as a CMM for sharks, replacing CMM 2006-05 (Attachment AA).     37"
WCPFC5,248,"The USA noted for the record that the new reporting requirements for sharks contained in para 4 of the new measure will require modification of existing data forms and protocols, and thus may require time to implement.   AGENDA  ITEM  8  -  INTERSESSIONAL WORKING GROUP — REGIONAL OBSERVER PROGRAMME"
WCPFC5,249,"The Chair of the Intersessional Working Group – Regional Observer Programme (Charles Karnella, USA) presented the results of the work of the second meeting of the IWG-ROP (WCPFC5-2008/16), which  was held from 7–10 July 2008 in Nadi, Fiji. At IWG-ROP2, there was a consensus on 11 interim minimum standards covering: Data Fields; Observer Guides and Manual; Observer Training; Code of Conduct; Safety; ROP National Coordinators; Briefing and Debriefing; Equipment and Materials; Communications; Measuring Performance; and Dispute Settlement. During the year, IWG-ROP2 also reached agreement on an authorization process for national observers; the role and function of audits; data fields to be collected by observers; and data management."
WCPFC5,250,"TCC4 recommended to the Commission that the work of the IWG-ROP be extended for another year in order to progress work on priority issues, which include definition of terms; costs; the minimum size of vessels that can accommodate an observer; and vessel and observer safety.  There is also a substantial list of other issues that require further discussion."
WCPFC5,251,"The Chair of the IWG-ROP requested that, in accordance with previous agreements, CCMs submit all relevant data pertaining to existing national, sub-regional and regional observer programmes to the Secretariat."
WCPFC5,252,"WCPFC5 adopted the contents of the IWG-ROP2 Summary Report, encouraging CCMs-to continue to discuss outstanding ROP issues, as provided for in CMM 2007-01 (Attachment K, Annex C) intersessionally."
WCPFC5,253,WCPFC5 extended the mandate of the IWG-ROP for an additional one-year period to continue to progress the priority work items identified [at para 248 above and in the report of the second meeting of the IWG-ROP.
WCPFC5,254,"WCPFC5 agreed that the Third IWG-ROP meeting will be held in Guam, USA, from 16–20 June 2009.3    AGENDA  ITEM  9  -  RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE PROTECTION, ACCESS TO AND DISSEMINATION OF DATA"
WCPFC5,255,"The Chair of the Ad Hoc Task Group–Data (Holly Koehler, USA) presented outcomes from the work of this Task Group in 2008 (WCPFC5-2008/17). The primary focus of the Task Group has been to work toward finalization of the “Rules and                                                  3  Post script added by the Secretariat: Following WCPFC5 at Busan it was suggested that, because of the impending need for ROP observers for the closure starting 1 August 2009, an IWG-ROP3 meeting should be convened earlier in the year. Taking advantage of the annual consultation between the USA and FFA members scheduled for Palau in March, it has been suggested that IWG ROP3 meet in Guam from 18–21 March. As proposed at WCPFC5, it is suggested that the Ad Hoc Task Group–Data then convene 23 and 24 March.    38 Procedures for the Protection, Access to and Dissemination of Non-Public Domain Data and Information Compiled by the Commission for the Purpose of Compliance and Enforcement Activities on the High Seas and Scientific Purposes”. The Chair noted these Rules and Procedures contain detailed, special provisions governing the use of VMS data."
WCPFC5,256,"The latest draft of the Rules and Procedures was circulated on 14 November 2008.  Remaining issues are expected to centre on VMS issues, including linkages with the VMS SSPs.  As it was considered impractical to attempt to finalize the draft at WCPFC5, a timetable was set by which CCMs would comment on the latest draft by mid-February 2009. The Task Group envisages working electronically during part of 2009 but it was stressed by the Chair that one or two face-to-face meetings during 2009 would be necessary to finalize the draft ROPs. It was suggested that such possible meetings could be held in conjunction with another WCPFC body (e.g. IWG-ROP3 or SC5) in order to have a well developed draft of the Rules and Procedures available for discussion at TCC5, which could then be submitted for consideration and adoption at WCPFC6."
WCPFC5,257,"One CCM queried whether the existing draft Rules and Procedures provide for data that are not required to be submitted to the Commission but which are submitted on a voluntary basis (e.g. scientific data collected by coastal States). Specifically, it was queried whether there could be a provision by which the submitting coastal State could place greater restrictions on the dissemination of voluntarily provided data, as opposed to data that are required to be submitted to the Commission."
WCPFC5,258,Another CCM stressed the importance of appropriately balancing the rights and responsibilities of data providers and data users. This CCM also considered that an additional section covering sanctions for inappropriate use or unauthorised release of data should be incorporated into the draft.
WCPFC5,259,"WCPFC5 recommended that the Ad Hoc Task Group–Data, request comments on the latest draft of the Rules and Procedures by mid-February 2009, and work electronically, and potentially meet in conjunction with IWG-ROP3 or SC5, to produce a final draft Rules and Procedures document for discussion at TCC5, with a view that such ROPs be submitted for consideration and adoption at WCPFC6.    AGENDA  ITEM  10  -  ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS 10.1 Annual Report on the Commission’s work"
WCPFC5,260,"The Executive Director presented the Annual Report on the Commission’s work Commission (WCPFC5-2008/21), including its six subsidiary bodies (i.e. SC, TCC, NC, IWG-ROP, AHTG–Data, and the VMS Technical Working Group). The report also covered Secretariat activities, relationships with other organizations, emerging issues and acknowledgements.  Occupation of the new headquarters building in Kolonia, Pohnpei, was cited as one of the highlights of 2008."
WCPFC5,261,The Chair acknowledged the volume and quality of work produced by the Secretariat in the past year and thanked the Executive Director for his productivity and commitment.     39 AGENDA  ITEM  11  -  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES
WCPFC5,262,"The Chair noted that the current balance of the Special Requirements Fund stands at US$ 140,000."
WCPFC5,263,"Tokelau, on behalf of FFA, expressed appreciation to the USA for contributions to the Fund, and to Japan for contributions to the Japan Trust Fund in fulfilment of Part VIII of the Convention, which requires creation and disbursement of the Fund to support the development of capacity to manage fish stocks by developing States in the region."
WCPFC5,264,"Another FFA member stressed the importance of cooperation of Commission Members on a wide range of fronts, including not only the Special Requirements Fund, but also the development of equitable and compatible management measures and issues of vessel provision and licensing."
WCPFC5,265,The Chair noted that the issue of the provision of vessels by Chinese Taipei to RMI and Tuvalu was also discussed under a separate agenda item (Agenda Item 7.5).    AGENDA  ITEM  12  -  COOPERATION WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS
WCPFC5,266,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC5-2008/24 (Rev. 1), detailing activities of the Commission with regard to other organisations. The revision to the paper was necessary to reflect recent developments concerning an MOU between WCPFC and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Key issues raised for CCMs’ consideration included:    a. A recommendation that the Commission enter into three-year agreements with SPC as the Science Services Provider, as recommended in the recent review of the Commission’s science structure and function;  b. Review, amend as necessary, and consider for adoption or otherwise, the proposed memorandum of understanding (MOU) with CCAMLR; c. Revise, if necessary, the existing MOU between WCPFC and ISC in order to allow the SC to directly request advice from ISC on the status of North Pacific stocks; d. Consider establishing a formal relationship with the NPAFC; and  e. Review, amend as necessary, and endorse the proposed data exchange agreement with SPC."
WCPFC5,267,Japan queried whether the automatic provision of WCPFC data supplied by Japan to SPC will still allow Japan to access the data from SPC even though it is not a member of SPC.
WCPFC5,268,John Hampton (SPC-OFP) replied that access by CCMs to SPC data is covered by para5 of the existing data Rules and Procedures.
WCPFC5,269,"In response to a query regarding whether aggregated catch data would reflect the three vessel rule (i.e. data must be aggregated in a manner that no fewer than three vessels are represented in each data point), the Executive Director clarified that the three vessel rule is protected under the Commission’s Rules and Procedures for data.     40"
WCPFC5,270,One CCM thanked the Secretariat for their impressive and diligent work on formalizing arrangements with other organizations.
WCPFC5,271,WCPFC5 adopted the recommendations to enter into a three-year arrangement with SPC as the Science Services Provider; adopt the MOU with CCAMLR; revisit the MOU with ISC; begin work to establish a formal relationship with NPAFC; and adopt the Data Exchange Agreement with SPC.

Develop a proposal for the control of nationals; i. Further develop the process for monitoring compliance; and j. Develop a charter arrangements scheme for consideration at WCPFC6.  AGENDA  ITEM  14  -  REPORT OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE
WCPFC5,273,"The Co-Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC), Tapusalaia Terry Toomata (Samoa), presented the Committee’s report to WCPFC5 (WCPFC5-2008/22). Highlights of the report included an agreement to re-appoint the Executive Director for a new four-year term beginning September 2009, and setting a timetable for developing a draft strategic plan for the Commission. It was reported that Toomata and Liu Xiaobing (China) were elected Co-Chairs of the FAC for 2009–2010. Dean Swanson (USA) was thanked for his efforts as Co-Chair over the past two years."
WCPFC5,274,"The generous contribution by PNG of US$ 100,000 of furnishings for the Commission headquarters building in Pohnpei, was gratefully acknowledged. Appreciation was also expressed to RMI for a contribution of artefacts to the Commission."
WCPFC5,275,"The FAC Chair noted that two additional items need to be incorporated into the Commission’s budget:    a. An allowance of US$ 20,000 to support the participation of the Commission Chair at TCC5 and WCPFC6; b. Provision for an additional compliance officer position as suggested by CCMs at WCPFC5.     41"
WCPFC5,276,"WCPFC5 adopted the recommendations of the FAC with regard to the assessment and expenditure of contributions for 2009, and an indicative budget for 2010 and 2011 as contained in WCPFC5-2008/22 (Attachment BB)   AGENDA  ITEM  15  -  WORK PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2009 AND INDICATIVE WORK PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2010 AND 2011"
WCPFC5,277,"The 2009 work programme and budget and indicative budgets for 2010 and 2011, as recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee, were adopted by the Commission. AGENDA  ITEM  16  -  ELECTION OF OFFICERS"
WCPFC5,278,"The Commission agreed by consensus to elect Ambassador Satya Nandan (Fiji) as Chair of the Commission for a term of two years. At the expiry of this term, non-FFA States will provide a candidate or candidates for the position of Chair for the consideration of the Commission."
WCPFC5,279,"Ambassador Nandan made a brief statement expressing appreciation to CCMs for allowing his candidacy to go forward. He congratulated Chair Hurry for his wise leadership and guidance in establishing both foundations for effective management and a strong spirit of cooperation in the Commission over the past five years, and expressed his hope that the same level of cooperation will be realized in the coming years."
WCPFC5,280,"Sylvie LaPointe (Canada) was elected, by consensus, to serve as Vice-Chair of the Commission for a term of two years. The efforts of outgoing Vice-Chair, Liu Xiaobing, were acknowledged with appreciation."

WCPFC5,282,"Masanori Miyahara (Japan) was re-elected as Chair, and Benjamin Tabios was re-elected as Vice-Chair, of the Northern Committee.   AGENDA  ITEM  17  -  OTHER MATTERS 17.1 Performance review"
WCPFC5,283,"The Commission Chair introduced the topic of an independent performance review for the Commission, indicating that it would require approximately US$ 100,000 of funding but that this amount has not been provided for in the 2009 budget. Therefore, the earliest the review could take place would be 2010."
WCPFC5,284,Some CCMs stated that conducting the review in 2010 would be preferable since many of the Commission’s CMMs are relatively new.
WCPFC5,285,"Other CCMs, including FFA members, considered that the review should take place as soon as possible. These CCMs referred to a paper (WCPFC4-2007/DP05) prepared by Australia for WCPFC4 in 2007, which can be used a basis for scoping the review.    42"
WCPFC5,286,WCPFC5 agreed that a WCPFC4 paper prepared by Australia be used as basis for TCC5 to develop recommendations for a structure and budget so that an independent performance review of the Commission can be conducted in 2010. 17.2 Second meeting of Tuna RFMOs
