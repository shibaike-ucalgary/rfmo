WCPFC8,15,"As the depository of the Convention, New Zealand reported that since their last report to WCPFC7, no further communications have been received and thus there has been no change in the status of the Convention.  New Zealand noted that WCPFC8-2011/08 describes the status of the Convention as of 15 November 2011."
WCPFC8,16,"In response to a question regarding their progress with ratifying the Convention, Indonesia stated that it was making significant progress toward ratification and it expected that this process will be finalized in the near future.   2.2 Applications for Observer Status"
WCPFC8,17,The Commission noted the applications for observer status as contained in WCPFC8-2012/09 (Rev. 1).   2.3 Applications for cooperating non-member status
WCPFC8,18,"Holly Koehler (USA), Vice Chair of the TCC, presented a report on cooperating non-member applications (WCPFC8-2011/10).  TCC7 reviewed eleven applications for cooperating non-member status for 2012, one of which, St. Kitts and Nevis, was a new applicant and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) was a second time applicant.  All applications were recommended for consideration by WCPFC8 subject to provision of additional information.  DPRK, El Salvador, Ecuador, Senegal, Panama and Belize, provided additional information.  The TCC Vice Chair clarified that Panama and Thailand are not required to submit Annual Reports Parts 1 and 2 for 2010 as they did not becomes CNMs until 2011."
WCPFC8,19,"The following points from the updated application files as of the opening of WCPFC8 were highlighted by the TCC Vice Chair:  a. Belize was asked to provide all available operational logsheet data and to confirm the number of vessels which would be operating in the WCPFC Convention Area if CNM status is renewed.  The information submitted by Belize indicated the number of fishing vessels that would continue to operate in the Convention Area if CNM status is renewed.  This information shows that since a logbook programme was only implemented in 2011, previous  4 operational data are not available.  Belize’s financial contribution for 2011 was paid in full.   b. The DPRK was asked to provide catch data and a breakdown of vessels.  These data were provided.  Regarding DPRK-flagged vessels on the CCAMLR IUU Vessel List, the DPRK information indicates that two vessels have been de-registered and the third vessel’s registration has expired.  The DPRK indicated it would make a financial contribution once it becomes a WCPFC member.   c. Ecuador was asked to confirm that its vessels will operate according to the participatory rights granted; equip vessels with VMS; provide catch data and Annual Reports.  Ecuador confirmed compliance with granted participatory rights and use of VMS and stated that it would apply IATTC management rules in the overlap area.  Some data were provided.  Ecuador’s financial contribution for 2011 was paid in full.   d. El Salvador was asked provide the number of days fished by purse seine vessels, and to confirm compliance with granted participatory rights.  El Salvador provided the effort data (WCPFC8-2011-OP12) and a FAD Management Plan (WCPFC8-2011-OP13), and indicated that it had historically fished the overlap area and reserved its right to do so as a member of IATTC.  El Salvador’s financial contribution for 2011 was paid in full.   e. Indonesia was asked to confirm its commitment to make a financial contribution to the Commission, provide the number of days fished by purse seine vessels, confirm compliance with participatory rights granted and VMS requirements, provide information on IUU-listed vessels, and provide catch and effort data.  No response was received from Indonesia.  No financial contribution was received for 2011.   f. Mexico was asked to confirm its commitment to make a financial contribution to the Commission, provide catch and effort data and its Annual Report – Part 2 for 2010.  No response was received from Mexico.  No Annual Reports were received from Mexico for 2011.  Mexico advised that it is not able to pay a contribution until it becomes a contracting party.   g. Panama was asked to provide information on IUU-listed vessels.  No response was received from Panama.  Panama advised that it was willing to pay its financial contribution but the payment had not yet been received by the Secretariat.   h. St. Kitts and Nevis was asked to confirm that its carriers and bunkers will comply with transhipment and VMS requirements.  No response was received from St Kitts and Nevis on these points, but it indicated a financial contribution can be made upon approval of the Ministry.   i. Senegal was asked to confirm compliance with High Seas Boarding and Inspection (HSBI) requirements and its commitment to provide a financial contribution.  It was noted that no vessels flagged to Senegal have fished in the WCPF Convention Area since 2008.  Senegal confirmed compliance with HSBI but stated that its national regulations do not allow financial contributions to international organizations unless it is a contracting Party.  Annual Reports-Parts 1 and 2 have not been received.  No financial contribution has been received.   j. Thailand was asked to confirm compliance with HSBI requirements.  Thailand confirmed it would comply.  Thailand’s 2011 financial contribution was paid in full.    5 k. Vietnam was asked to provide Annual Reports-Parts 1 and 2 for 2010.  No response was received from Vietnam.  Vietnam’s 2011 financial contribution was paid in full."
WCPFC8,20,"FFA members, while recognizing that CNM applicants represent legitimate development partners, stressed the importance of CNM applicants providing all requested information to TCC and paying their share of the costs of the Commission as assessed."
WCPFC8,21,Other CCMs also urged CNM applicants to provide requested information and to make financial contributions.
WCPFC8,22,One CNM pointed out that there appears to be no difference in the treatment of CNM applications from those CNM applicants which have paid their assessed financial contribution and those which have not.
WCPFC8,23,"Some CCM highlighted the ongoing issues involving the overlap area. These CCMs suggested that until these issues are resolved, CNMs should fish in accordance with the participatory rights granted to them by WCPFC.   Other CCMs reminded that CNMs who are also members of IATTC have historical fishing rights in the overlap area and comply with IATTC provisions that include total closure for tropical tuna purse seine fishery. Those CCMs considered it urgent to agree a joint approach with IATTC for managing the overlap area as suggested by the Chair's report of the Joint IATTC-WCPFC Workshop that took place on July 11, 2011 in La Jolla, California, USA in the margin of Kobe ΠΙ meeting."
WCPFC8,24,The Cook Islands expressed concerns regarding increasing catches in the IATTC-WCPFC overlap area by Ecuador and El Salvador.
WCPFC8,25,"The Executive Director of IATTC stated that he is optimistic about prospects for resolving issues related to the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area, and emphasized the importance of focusing on the status of the stocks when dealing with these issues."
WCPFC8,26,Some CCMs supported the CNM application of Indonesia.
WCPFC8,27,"Some CCMs indicated that while Indonesia continues to report progress on ratification, and the Commission has shown patience in this regard, demonstrable results should to be presented to WCPFC9."
WCPFC8,28,"Indonesia noted that, similar to its position in other t-RFMOs, it will not be able to make a financial contribution until it becomes a full member.  Indonesia stated that progress toward ratification is being made and a Presidential decree is expected soon.  In reply to a query about the status of Indonesia-flagged vessels on RFMO IUU Vessel Lists, Indonesia explained that all administrative sanctions have been complied with and remaining issues are being discussed with IATTC."
WCPFC8,29,The Chairman of the Northern Committee noted that Mexico has not responded to requests to participate in the work of the Northern Committee and requested the WCPFC Chair to write to Mexico to emphasize the importance of this issue.
WCPFC8,30,Mexico committed to participating in the Northern Committee starting at NC8.     6
WCPFC8,31,One CCM requested that Panama provide information on all of their t-RFMO IUU-listed vessels for the consideration of TCC8 when evaluating CNM applications for 2013.
WCPFC8,32,"Panama explained that it had made several attempts to pay its financial contribution and would continue to attempt to effect payment.  Panama referred CCMs to papers they submitted as WCPFC8-2011-DP/43, WCPFC8-2011-DP/44 and WCPFC8-2011-OP/14, which provide more information regarding Panama-flagged vessels on IUU lists and Panamas Annual Report Part 1."
WCPFC8,33,Papua New Guinea expressed concerns regarding the building of new purse seine fishing vessels by Vietnam.
WCPFC8,34,Vietnam requested more information from Papua New Guinea about these concerns and questioned whether this type of issue is pertinent to a decision on CNM status.
WCPFC8,35,"The WCPFC Legal Advisor, Dr Martin Tsamenyi, provided a summary of the procedures for considering CNM application.  As specified in CMM 2009-01, the process has four stages.  First, the applicant must provide the required data.  Second, TCC undertakes an evaluation of the application, identifies any gaps that applicants are required to fill and informs the applicant of these gaps.  Third, TCC makes a recommendation on each CNM’s application to the Commission, and fourth, the Commission considers the TCC’s recommendations, including any remaining areas of insufficiency in the applications, and decides whether to grant CNM status.  Regarding the fourth step, CMM 2009-01 is clear with respect to the need for the Commission to consider whether the technical information provided is adequate.  If the information is considered adequate then CNM status will be granted and subsequent to that decision the Commission will determine the participatory rights for each applicant.  The Commission was reminded that the determination of the sufficiency of the information provided to support the application is separate from the determination of participatory rights."
WCPFC8,36,"WCPFC8 agreed to grant CNM status for 2012 to Belize, the DPRK, Ecuador, El Salvador, Indonesia, Mexico, Panama, St. Kitts and Nevis, Senegal, Thailand and Vietnam."
WCPFC8,37,WCPFC8 also agreed that the WCPFC Chair will write to Mexico to reinforce the importance of their participation in the work of the Northern Committee.
WCPFC8,38," A small working group, led by Kiribati, was convened to consider the issue of participatory rights for CNMs.  The small working group developed draft report language for participatory rights for CNMs including for the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area (WCPFC8-2011-48 Rev2).  These recommendations were accepted by WCPFC8."
WCPFC8,39,"WCPFC8 agreed that in accordance with provisions of the WCPF Convention and its conservation and management measures and resolutions, the following limits apply to the participatory rights of Cooperating non-members (CNMs) for fisheries in the high seas within the WCPFC Convention Area."
WCPFC8,40,"WCPFC8 also agreed that, unless otherwise specified below, CNMs may fish in waters under their national jurisdiction or other CCM’s national jurisdiction, in accordance with appropriate bilateral arrangements. Such CNMs shall ensure vessels flying their flags comply with all provisions of the WCPF Convention and WCPFC conservation and management measures. In addition, such CNM vessels will be placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV). CCMs shall ensure that  7 CNM fishing activities that are conducted in waters under their national jurisdiction in accordance with bilateral arrangements are consistent with all relevant conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention. Renewal of CNM status by the Commission will be conditional on full compliance with the national laws and regulations of any licensing CCM, all conservation and management measures and provisions of the WCPF Convention. CCMs shall identify any violations by vessels flagged to a CNM and report on any investigations of such violations to the TCC."
WCPFC8,41,WCPFC8 noted that the CNMs identified below (paragraphs 43-53) provide assurances that they will comply with all requests from Commission Members for information and documentation to investigate cases of possible illegal fishing.
WCPFC8,42,"WCPFC8 encouraged CNMs to implement export controls that ensure that their shipbuilding activities do not undermine any conservation and management measures adopted by the Commission to control fishing capacity in the WCPO tuna fisheries, in accordance with Article 10, or undermine Article 30 of the Convention.  Belize"
WCPFC8,43,"WCPFC8 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Belize with the following participatory rights:  Catches of bigeye tuna from Belize are limited to 803.25 mt and 2,000 mt of yellowfin tuna. Belize fishing activities are limited to the following (except within the overlap area in accordance with the provisions described in paragraph 54-58 below):  a. Under CMM 2005-02 in accordance with paragraph 1, Belize is limited to historical catch level for 2004 of two unique longliners in the Convention Area south of 20 degrees south latitude;  b. Under CMM 2005-03 Belize is limited to the 2005 level of five unique longliners in the Convention Area north of the equator; and c. Under CMM 2006-04, Belize is limited to two unique longliners in the Convention Area south of 15 degrees south latitude.   Democratic People’s Republic of Korea"
WCPFC8,44,WCPFC8 approved the application of CNM status by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea with the following participatory rights:  The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area.   Ecuador
WCPFC8,45,WCPFC8 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Ecuador with the following participatory rights:  The participatory rights of Ecuador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only. Ecuador has no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area (except within the overlap area in accordance with the provisions described in paragraph 54-58 below).   El Salvador
WCPFC8,46,WCPFC8 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by El Salvador with the following participatory rights:   8 The participatory rights of El Salvador for fishing in the WCPO are limited to purse seine fishing only.

Indonesia
WCPFC8,47,"WCPFC8 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Indonesia with the following participatory rights:  Indonesia‘s fishing activities in the Convention Area are limited to a longline bigeye catch limit of 5,889 mt (8,413 mt minus 30%) and purse-seine fishing on the high seas in the Convention Area is limited to 500 days.  WCPFC8 encouraged Indonesia to apply compatible measures within its archipelagic waters given the significance of these waters for juvenile yellowfin and bigeye catch. Indonesia noted that it is participating in the new Global Environment Facility (GEF) West Pacific East Asia Oceanic Fisheries Management (WPEA OFM) and cooperating with the Commission, particularly in areas of data collection improvement.  Indonesia expressed its appreciation to the Commission for the decision to renew its CNM status and reiterated its intention to become a full member of the Commission, Indonesia stated that, consistent with its position throughout the Multilateral High Level Conference (MHLC) and Preparatory Conference, it considers that WCPFC CMMs do not apply to archipelagic waters.   Mexico"
WCPFC8,48,"WCPFC8 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Mexico with the following participatory rights:  Noting the need for cooperation with the work of the Northern Committee (NC), particularly in regard to Pacific bluefin tuna, Mexico is encouraged to participate in the NC and is advised that future renewals of Mexico’s CNM status could be hampered by a continuing lack of participation in the work of the NC.  Mexican participation in the WCPO tuna fisheries may not begin until all requested information and commitments have been provided to the WPFC Secretariat in accordance with Commission requirements. The participatory rights of Mexico for fishing in the WCPFC Convention Area are limited to purse seine fishing only. Mexico has no participatory rights for fishing on the high seas for highly migratory fish stocks in the Convention Area (except within the overlap area in accordance with the provisions described in paragraph 54-58 below).

WCPFC8,52,"WCPFC8 approved the application for CNM status by Thailand with the following participatory rights:  Noting the need for cooperation between Thailand and the Commission and the commitment from Thailand to provide data from canneries located in Thailand to assist in the work of the Commission, WCPFC8 agreed to grant CNM status to Thailand for 2012 on the understanding that Thailand will cooperate fully with the Commission in the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data. The participatory rights of Thailand in the WCPO are limited to the provision of carrier and bunker vessels only.   Vietnam"
WCPFC8,53,"WCPFC8 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Vietnam with the following participatory rights:  Noting the need for continued cooperation between Vietnam and the Commission to achieve compatibility of fisheries management and conservation, as well as on the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data, for which Vietnam would require assistance, WCPFC8 agreed to grant CNM status to Vietnam for 2012. Vietnam has no participatory rights for fishing for highly migratory fish stocks in the high seas of the Convention Area.   WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area"
WCPFC8,54,The Commission agreed that the WCPFC and the IATTC should urgently resolve the management uncertainties and inconsistencies that apply to fisheries within the overlap area south of 4° S and between 130° W and 150° W. The following provisions are intended as an interim measure and do not establish any precedent for the discussions between the WCPFC and the IATTC over the management of the overlap area.
WCPFC8,55,"For 2012, pending agreement between WCPFC and IATTC on management of the overlap in the Convention Areas of these two RFMOs, the limits prescribed above shall not apply to fishing vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party of IATTC and operating in the IATTC/WCPFC overlap area south of 4° S and between 130° W and 150° W."
WCPFC8,56,"These CNMs agree that in the IATTC/WCPFC overlap area fishing vessels flying their flag shall:   comply with all applicable IATTC Resolutions and requirements including effort, capacity and catch controls and limits;   carry, on all purse seine vessels, an observer accredited with either the IATTC observer program or WCPFC ROP; and   operate a vessel monitoring system (VMS) in accordance with IATTC Resolution C-04-06.  10"
WCPFC8,57,"In accordance with the Data Exchange MOU agreed by both Commissions, flag states of fishing vessels flying the flag of a member of either the IATTC or WCPFC, shall cooperate with the RFMO to which they are not a member by voluntarily providing operational catch and effort data for its fishing activities for highly migratory species in the overlap area."
WCPFC8,58,"For investigation of possible IUU fishing activities consistent to international and domestic laws, flag states of fishing vessels flying the flag of a CNM that is a Contracting Party to the IATTC will cooperate with those coastal State members of the WCPFC whose EEZs occur in the overlap area by voluntarily providing VMS reports (date, time and position) to those coastal States when operating in the overlap area."
WCPFC8,59,Discussion continued on the IATTC and WCPFC Overlap Area under Agenda 11.1.1 (see paragraphs 430 – 440).   AGENDA  ITEM  3  -  MEMBER STATEMENTS 3.1 Annual Reports by the CCMs
WCPFC8,60,"Aliki Faipule Kerisiano Kalolo, the Ulu O of Tokelau, delivered a statement to WCPFC8 (WCPFC8-2011-DP/46), Attachment E.   3.2 Statements of Non-Members"
WCPFC8,61,There were no statements provided by cooperating non-members.
WCPFC8,62,Statements were provided by WWF South Pacific Albacore Policy Brief (Attachment F) and Greenpeace Position on Rights Based Management (Attachment G). 3.3 Special Requirements of Developing States 3.3.1 CCM Reports on the Implementation of Article 30 of the Convention
WCPFC8,63,The Chair introduced this agenda item explaining that it originates in Article 30 of the WCPF Convention.  The Chair suggested that a common understanding of the intent of Article 30 would be necessary for the Commission to make progress on achieving that intent.
WCPFC8,64," Some CCMS, including FFA members, expressed a desire to see a more genuine commitment to the development of SIDS fishing and fish processing capabilities, and to receive assistance that responds to the needs articulated by SIDS.  FFA members noted that they would be seeking greater integration of these issues through key agenda items in WCPFC8 rather than through  a single agenda item."
WCPFC8,65,Wallis and Futuna informed WCPFC8 that a small longliner has recently begun operations in their waters and they looked forward to further development of their fishery.
WCPFC8,66,"Japan noted that it has made substantial contributions to SIDS in the form of economic, health and infrastructure projects with a total contribution of 35 million USD over five years.  Other contributions have focused on training programmes, improvement of fishing technology, and assistance with travel costs provided through FFA.    11"
WCPFC8,67,The United States submitted a written statement (WCPFC8-2011-DP53- Attachment H) and confirmed it was prepared to listen at WCPFC8 and other forums to the aspirations of SIDS.
WCPFC8,68,"The EU submitted a written statement (WCPFC8-2011 DP50, and appended as Attachment I) and indicated that it wished to strengthen its cooperation with SIDS by consulting with them to continue addressing their needs."
WCPFC8,69,"Chinese Taipei described several training, fisheries development, vessel construction and technology transfer projects which it believes have developed skills, capacity and economic benefits for SIDS."
WCPFC8,70,"Korea stated that it recently hosted a capacity building workshop on port state measures and catch documentation schemes, and is planning to host another workshop on data improvement, ecosystems and bycatch with all travel costs paid."
WCPFC8,71,"The Philippines noted its partnership with SIDS in fisheries development, in particular noting its construction of two canneries, with an additional two planned, creating a substantial number of new jobs and export revenue."
WCPFC8,72,"Some CCMs suggested that reiterating descriptions of ongoing assistance projects is not a useful exercise.  Nauru on behalf of FFA members, recommended that the most robust way of recognising the special requirements of SIDS would be to make explicit allowance concerning these special requirements as an integral part of each CMM."
WCPFC8,73,The Chair noted that this dialogue had produced some clear statements regarding the type of assistance required and the willingness of development partners to assist.  The WCPFC Chair also stated that the discussion demonstrated the need to integrate the intent of Article 30 of the Convention into considerations of the Commission’s CMMs.   AGENDA  ITEM  4  -  COMMISSION REVIEW 4.1 Review of the WCPFC
WCPFC8,74,"The Chair of the WCPFC Performance Review Panel (PRP), Dr Fábio Hazin, presented the report of the panel (WCPFC8-2011/12).  The work of the panel was initiated in 2011 and involved four external experts (Dr Denzil Miller, Dr Fábio Hazin, Mr Ichiro Nomura and Dr Judith Swan) and three internal experts (Mr John Spencer (EU), the Hon. Min. Roland Kun (Nauru), and Mr Malcolm Sarmiento (Philippines)).  The report contains 79 recommendations which were presented for discussion by CCMs."
WCPFC8,75,All CCMs which voiced an opinion remarked on the usefulness of the review and on the valuable and comprehensive advice provided.  They thanked the PRP members for their tremendous efforts.
WCPFC8,76,"Several CCMs, including FFA members, requested that more time be provided for review and comment on the document."
WCPFC8,77,Some CCMs expressed regret at not being able to provide input to the PRP noting that they did not receive any request for input and therefore were unaware of the opportunity.     12
WCPFC8,78,Some CCMs stated that it would not be appropriate for CCMs to comment on the recommendations of the PRP as it is an independent body and noted that the document is a final report.
WCPFC8,79,The Executive Director clarified that the work of the PRP is now complete and that any further involvement will have contractual implications.
WCPFC8,80,"Some CCMs stated that the report as it now stands provides a useful reference, and suggested that the Commission immediately begin to implement as appropriate specific points in the report as various issues come before the Commission for discussion."
WCPFC8,81,"  Some CCMs and observers advocated a more systematic approach to responding to the recommendations of the PRP, e.g. preparing an implementation plan or framework, creating a standing agenda item for Commission meetings, or categorizing the recommendations and distributing them to the Commission’s subsidiary bodies for prioritization and action as appropriate.  The EU drew attention to its previous written communication to CCMs on a possible approach for follow-up to the review. It proposed that the WCPFC Secretariat prepare a table with three columns: one column with the panel recommendations, one column with the WCPFC body best placed to follow-up on this recommendation, and one column with the proposed way forward."
WCPFC8,82,"WCPFC8 noted the report of the Performance Review Panel.  WCPFC8 agreed that CCMs could provide comments to the Secretariat by June 1 2012 on the priorities and process to move the recommendations forward.  WCPFC8 tasked the Executive Director with preparing a matrix categorising the recommendations, and noting any comments from CCMs, for the consideration of the Commission’s subsidiary bodies as appropriate.  The matrix and recommendations from subsidiary bodies will be considered at WCPFC9.   AGENDA  ITEM  5  -  COST RECOVERY REVIEW 5.1 Cost Optimisation of Commission Operations"
WCPFC8,83,"Mr Nick Wyatt presented a report entitled “Cost Recovery and Optimization of Commission Services Costs” (WCPFC8-2011/13 (Rev 1)).  The objectives of the study were to identify costs that would be appropriate and practical to recover, and to explore cost recovery as a means of optimising the costs of Commission services.  The Commission services assessed in the report included the VMS, the ROP, the RFV, CNMs, observers at meetings, and carriers and bunkers.  Scientific services were not assessed.  The study considered that the key way for cost optimisation to occur is when those who face the costs are able to influence those costs by changing their behaviour."
WCPFC8,84,"Regarding VMS, it was considered that the Service Level Agreement (SLA) does not provide incentives for cost optimisation and the study recommended that users should meet mobile communication costs and activation charges."
WCPFC8,85,"Since the cost of the ROP is mainly driven by data entry costs, the study recommended that direct cost of data entry should be paid by vessels, based on an average cost per vessel regardless of whether they carry an observer.     13"
WCPFC8,86,"The RFV was considered to be not particularly useful, and the study recommended that it should be converted to a central vessel register of the vessels that fish.  Listing should be charged on a per vessel basis to encourage only those vessels which fish to be registered."
WCPFC8,87,"In general, it was considered that CNMs should face same charges as full members.  However, as CNMs receive the same benefits but no voting rights, a discount of 50% was considered appropriate."
WCPFC8,88,"The study noted that the cost of the WCPFC is quite low compared to other Commissions, and that the costs of the Secretariat itself should not be recovered as this would create poor incentives."
WCPFC8,89,CCMs uniformly expressed concerns about the rising costs of the Commission and welcomed the opportunity to explore how to optimise and contain those costs.
WCPFC8,90,"FFA members noted that SIDS, especially those with few vessels are at present disproportionately carrying the burden for vessel-based costs.  These members also noted the high costs associated with attending meetings and referred to their proposal for the rationalisation of the Commission’s meeting schedule (WCPFC8-2011-DP/48, discussed under Agenda Item 14)."
WCPFC8,91,"Some CCMs opposed the idea of distributing costs to vessels, pointing out that the current model allocates costs to CCMs based on catch history representing vessel activities and a wealth component."
WCPFC8,92,The EU stated that this study should have looked as a priority at cost optimisation and only afterwards at cost recovery.
WCPFC8,93,"Some CCMs questioned why the study focused more on cost recovery than on cost optimisation.  Australia noted that there are two distinct avenues to this work: cost optimisation and cost recovery, and that both avenues can (and should) run simultaneously."
WCPFC8,94,"Several CCMs noted that the Commission’s VMS and ROP have major implications for costs and thus should be examined in greater technical detail to find opportunities for cost savings.  Specific points mentioned included several options for ROP data entry and transfer protocols, and removing duplication within regional VMSs."
WCPFC8,95,A number of CCMs suggested that the Secretariat be tasked with progressing the issues of cost optimization intersessionally particularly around issues relating to VMS and ROP.  It was recommended that these further technical points be revisited under agenda items pertaining to the ROP and VMS.   AGENDA  ITEM  6  -  SCIENCE ISSUES 6.1 Report of the Seventh Regular Session of the Scientific Committee
WCPFC8,96,"Dr Naozumi Miyabe, Chair of the Scientific Committee, presented the report of SC7 (WCPFC8-2011/14).       14 6.1.1 Stock Status of Key Tuna Species"
WCPFC8,97,"Dr John Hampton of SPC, the Scientific Services Provider to the Commission, presented a summary of the status of the stocks (WCPFC8-2011-IP/02) based on the full report presented to SC7 in WCPFC8-2011/14."
WCPFC8,98,Total catches for 2011 appear to have remained stable compared to 2010 at a level of ~2.4 million t.
WCPFC8,99,"The total purse seine fishery catch in 2010 was 1.7 million t which represents a reduction from the peak catch in 2009.  It is expected that 2011 purse seine catches, once fully compiled, will be slightly lower, although effort in 2011 was at a record high.  This is because purse seine catch quantity varies with set type.  Unassociated sets comprised a record high of ~75% of the total in 2010, whereas 2011 was a more typical year with a more even balance in unassociated and associated (both FAD and log) sets (i.e. 60% and 40%, respectively).  During the three FAD closures in 2009, 2010 and 2011, the effort (in days) in the purse seine fishery continued at near-normal levels.  .  In 2009 and 2010, catch rates were somewhat reduced during the FAD closure, but rebounded immediately after the FAD closure ended.  In 2011 there was poor performance in the fishery during the closure itself, and based on limited data available to date, catch rates again seem to have increased during the fourth quarter.  These features of the 2011 fishery may have been due to La Niña effects which had concentrated the purse seine fishery in the western portion of the WCPF Convention Area by the fourth quarter of 2010."
WCPFC8,100,"In the longline fishery, the proportion of the catch consisting of bigeye tuna has diminished in recent years while the proportion of albacore catch has increased substantially.  An estimation of longline effort based on VMS data suggests that effort is and increasing in both the tropical and southern fishing grounds."
WCPFC8,101,"The catch of skipjack tuna fell slightly in 2010 and is expected to decline further in 2011 most likely due to poor fishing conditions in the middle part of the year.  The total catch of 1.6 million t in 2010 was dominated by purse seine catches while the proportion of catch from the pole and line fishery continued to decrease.  Currently skipjack stocks are estimated to be depleted to 55% of their unexploited biomass and if current catches continue stock depletion will reach 25% of unexploited biomass.  Skipjack stocks are not considered overfished, nor is overfishing occurring."
WCPFC8,102,"Catches of yellowfin tuna have recently stabilized after a prolonged trend of increase.  Current exploitation levels (~500,000 t per year) are approaching the limit of the stock’s exploitation potential.  Currently, yellowfin stocks are estimated to be depleted to 40% of their unexploited biomass, but in the western equatorial zone, where 90% of the catch occurs, estimates of depletion to 30% unexploited biomass are of concern.  Yellowfin stocks are not considered overfished, nor is overfishing occurring."
WCPFC8,103,"For bigeye tuna, most catches were adult fish caught by the longline fishery.  The catch in 2010 was the lowest since 1996 and the level of depletion in the stock (to~20% of unexploited levels) i.e. SBcurrent/SBcurrent F=o =0.23, is the highest of any tuna stock in WCPF Convention Area.  Overfishing is occurring in bigeye tuna stocks (F>FMSY); the bigeye stock biomass is approaching the MSY biomass and there is a possibility that bigeye tuna is already in an overfished state.     15"
WCPFC8,104,"South Pacific albacore tuna is mainly caught by the longline fishery and this catch is primarily composed of adult fish.  Catches have doubled since 1995 with a 30% increase in 2010 catches compared to 2009.  Continuing a trend of steady decline since the mid 1960s, South Pacific albacore stocks are estimated to be depleted to 60% of their unexploited biomass.  Catches in 2010 of 81,000 t are the highest on record and current catch rates are approaching MSY levels.  Albacore stocks are not considered overfished, nor is overfishing occurring."
WCPFC8,105,FFA members expressed appreciation for the work of the SPC and their interest in seeing the results of the next South Pacific albacore assessment.
WCPFC8,106,"The EU noted the level of purse seiner efforts demonstrates that CMM 2008-01 had not  been effective. On claims that the FADs closure had been largely respected, it queried the basis for such conclusions, especially in a context where many observer reports are still not available and considering that observer coverage on purse seiners in some EEZs has been only around 50 %, as evident from Part 1 national reports and the 3rd Annual Report for the Regional Observer Programme WCPFC8-2011-24. This is all the more important considering that 95 % of the purse seine fishing activities take place in waters of coastal states.The EU questioned whether the recent observed shifts in purse seine set type patterns from associated sets to unassociated sets are due to La Niña effects.  It also requested that annual catch data be provided by area for EEZs, archipelagic waters and the high seas and that this data will be systematically provided in the future.  The EU suggested that as 2010 was an anomalous year it should not be used as a baseline.  Further clarification was requested regarding whether the reference to longline effort increase was based on a change in the number of hooks fished."
WCPFC8,107,Japan posed similar questions regarding the unique characteristics of the 2010 fishing year and the distribution of catch in the EEZs versus the eastern and western high seas areas.
WCPFC8,108,"Dr Hampton confirmed that sets on logs, and other associated set types, were low in 2010, but there is insufficient evidence to establish a link between this and La Niña conditions.  He noted that 2011 set type data showed a more typical pattern, but that low catches of log-associated fish have continued.  The use of 2010 fishery conditions in the projections was simply because it was the most recent data available and provides one example of the reductions in current fishing effort that may be required to achieve MSY conditions for bigeye tuna.  He referred CCMs to other documentation provided to the Commission containing the requested catch data (see WCPFC8-2011-IP/10 (Rev 1)).  Regarding longline effort, Dr Hampton explained that the analysis was based on VMS data which is expected to be approximately proportional to effort in hooks; however actual figures for effort in hooks must await compilation of logsheet data."
WCPFC8,109,FFA noted that the figure used for some CCMs to suggest that the FAD closure did not work in 2011 could not be relied upon as it only contains data through to June 2011- before the commencement of the FAD closure. 6.1.2 Science Committee Recommendations and Management Advice
WCPFC8,110,"The SC Chair presented the stock management recommendations from SC7 (WCPFC8-2011/14):   a. Bigeye Tuna:  Overfishing is occurring and there is a possibility that the stock is in an overfished state.  A minimum reduction of 32% in current F would be required to achieve FMSY.    16 b. Yellowfin Tuna:  Overfishing is not occurring and the stock is not overfished (although one modelling simulation indicated overfishing).  It was noted that there should be no increase in F in the western equatorial region since it accounts for ~81% of the total yellowfin catch, spawning biomass derives from this region, and the stock is estimated to have declined to about 31% of its unexploited level.   c. Skipjack Tuna:  Although F has been higher in the last decade, the stock is not overfished and the moderate level of exploitation represented by the current F is considered sustainable.   d. South Pacific Albacore:  The stock is not overfished nor is overfishing occurring.  The current stock biomass can sustain the current catch but any increase in F is likely to result in catch rate declines especially for longline catches of adult fish. e. South Pacific Swordfish:  As there is no new stock assessment, the management advice from SC5 is maintained.   f. South West Pacific Striped Marlin:  As there is no new stock assessment, the management advice from SC2 is maintained.   g. North Pacific Striped Marlin.  As there is no new stock assessment, the management advice from SC6 is maintained and SC7 acknowledged the need to for an immediate reduction in F for this species.   h. North Pacific Albacore.  As there is neither overfishing nor is the stock in an overfished state, this stock is considered to be healthy and its sustainability is not threatened.   i. Pacific Bluefin Tuna:  As there is no new stock assessment, the management advice from SC6 is maintained.  (Efforts toward reducing F for this species are discussed under Agenda Item 7).   j. North Pacific Swordfish:  No new stock assessment was conducted.  As SC6 concluded that North Pacific swordfish stocks are healthy, no management advice was provided."
WCPFC8,111,"FFA members articulated their support for the scientific recommendations of SC7 and noted they would be raising specific concerns for some of the stocks under other agenda items.  In particular, FFA members urged that fishing mortality for bigeye tuna be reduced across a range of gear types and that updated projections be used in deliberations on CMM 2008-01.   6.1.3 SC Management Issues Theme"
WCPFC8,112,"Other management issues arising from discussions at SC7, including terms of reference for the “Management Issues Theme” of SC, Limit Reference Points, and the Management Objectives Workshop, were presented by Dr Miyabe (WCPFC8-2011/39).    Terms of Reference for “Management Issues Theme” of SC"
WCPFC8,113,"The SC Chair explained that the Management Issues Theme was held at SC6 and SC7.  At SC7 a Terms of Reference for the theme was discussed and recommended for WCPFC8 adoption (WCPFC8-2011-14, Attachment G)."
WCPFC8,114,FFA members supported the Terms of References for the Management Issues Theme.
WCPFC8,115,Japan stated that it was inappropriate for the Scientific Committee to consider economic and social issues and asked for revisions to the Terms of Reference.     17
WCPFC8,116,The USA noted that inclusion of economic and social factors was included in the Terms of Reference for the theme based on the recommendations of the Independent Review of the Commission’s Transitional Science Structure and Functions.
WCPFC8,117,Japan submitted amendments to the Management Issues Theme Terms of Reference (WCPFC8-2011-DP/47).
WCPFC8,118,WCPFC8 adopted the revised Terms of Reference for the Management Issues Theme of the Scientific Committee as contained in WCPFC8-2011-DP/47.  This is appended as Attachment J.    Limit Reference Points
WCPFC8,119,"Dr Miyabe explained that SC7 considered a hierarchical structure for, and definitions of, limit reference points (LRPs)."
WCPFC8,120,"FFA members noted the importance of defining reference points and expressed support for the hierarchical approach.  However, these CCMs considered that more work needs to be done to refine the definitions prior to SC8.  FFA members stated that they are working toward defining reference points for stocks in their EEZs.  They considered that reference points can be set to incorporate social and economic concerns, for example, it may be appropriate to set reference points above MSY in order to maintain stocks at levels which are economically viable as well as biologically sustainable."
WCPFC8,121,"The EU stated that reference points should be set only for biological considerations. Socio-economic aspects can be considered when developing management objectives, inter alia in the framework of the Management Objectives Workshop (MOW)."
WCPFC8,122,The WCPFC Chair observed that there are some stocks lying outside of FFA members’ EEZs which also require reference points to be defined.
WCPFC8,123,"Some CCMs expressed the opinion that LRPs should focus on biology; in contrast, managers can set target reference points (TRPs) based on considerations of social and economic factors."
WCPFC8,124,"Dr SungKwon Soh explained that since the Management Objective Workshop had been postponed, the Scientific Services Provider was using funds previously allocated for reference point research in 2011 to continue to progress this work prior to SC8.  Results presented and discussed at SC8 would then be discussed at the Management Objectives Workshop before being presented to the Commission."
WCPFC8,125,"WCPFC8 endorsed the hierarchical approach to identifying limit reference points, tasked the Scientific Services Provider with preparing proposed limit reference points for the consideration of SC8, and directed SC8 to take account of WCPFC8’s concerns regarding reference points in its further deliberations.    Management Objectives Workshop (TORs, Schedule, Venue)"
WCPFC8,126,"Dr Miyabe presented a draft terms of reference for the Management Objectives Workshop (MOW) and requested direction from WCPFC8 regarding a date, a venue, a convenor and suitable independent international experts (WCPFC8-2011/39).     18"
WCPFC8,127,"The Executive Director added that the purpose of the MOW is to introduce the terms and framework for harvest control rules, of which LRPs and TRPs are a part, and then to begin to work toward the development of management objectives.  He stated that CCMs will be requested to provide nominations for a convenor and expert participants."
WCPFC8,128,"Japan expressed concern that the draft TOR of the MOW proposed by the Secretariat was substantially expanded in scope from the one prepared by SC7. In particular, it pointed out that the harvest control rule, which was implemented in the case of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) whose stock was in a critical condition, might not be appropriate for the species covered by the WCPFC, which are in much better position than SBT."
WCPFC8,129,"Canada expressed its strong support for the MOW and drew WCPFC8’s attention to its proposal for a pilot project on bigeye tuna involving applying the Kobe II strategy matrix as a harmonized format for conveying scientific advice (WCPFC8-2011/39, Attachment 1)."
WCPFC8,130,"While generally supportive of holding the MOW, CCMs requested more discussion of the terms of reference and MOW scheduling."
WCPFC8,131,Palau led a SWG to further develop and refine the MOW terms of reference and the logistics for holding the workshop.
WCPFC8,132,WCPFC8 adopted the terms of reference for the management objectives workshop as produced by the SWG in WCPFC8-2011/39 (Rev 2) (Attachment K).  WCPFC8 considered that the optimal dates for the workshop would be just prior to WCPFC9 (29-30 November 2012) and that the workshop should be led by a professional facilitator.   6.1.4 Ecosystem and Bycatch Issues Shark Key Species
WCPFC8,133,Dr Miyabe noted that SC7 had recommended to WCPFC8 a process for designating WCPFC key shark species for data provision and assessment (WCPFC8-2011-IP/05).
WCPFC8,134,WPCFC8 adopted the process for designating WCPFC key shark species.  (Attachment L)
WCPFC8,135,Dr Miyabe also noted that SC7 recommended that WCPFC8 consider mitigation measures for oceanic white tip and blue sharks in the North Pacific.  These issues were considered through discussion of a proposal for a new CMM on sharks (Agenda Item 9.2.6).    Seabirds
WCPFC8,136,"Dr Miyabe explained that based on discussion of seabird issues at SC7 no new management recommendations were formulated, thus the management recommendations from SC6 are still current.      Whales Sharks and Cetaceans"
WCPFC8,137,"Dr Miyabe introduced discussions at SC7 regarding best practice guidelines for the release of whale sharks and cetaceans without injury, noting that these issues would be considered through discussion of two proposals for new CMMs under Agenda Item 9.2.2.     19"
WCPFC8,138,PNA members reminded WCPFC8 that setting on whale sharks is prohibited under the PNA’s Third Implementing Arrangement.  The arrangement reads: “ No purse seine vessel shall engage in fishing or related activity in order to catch tuna associated with whale sharks”
WCPFC8,139,One CCM suggested that a stock assessment be conducted for whale sharks.
WCPFC8,140,"Other CCMs noted that decisions to conduct stock assessments should be taken following the process for designating WCPFC key shark species which can then be prioritized for stock assessment.  Therefore, further consideration of an assessment for whale sharks should be taken up by the Scientific Committee.    Food security issues with bycatch"
WCPFC8,141,Dr Miyabe noted that SC7 recommended that issues associated with the volumes of food fish discarded in regional tuna fisheries and the impact of tuna fishing on key food stocks be incorporated into the research plan of the SC.
WCPFC8,142,WCPFC8 agreed that consideration of research on the volume of food fish discard and the impact of tuna fishing on key food species should be undertaken by the SC.   6.1.5 Data Issues
WCPFC8,143,"Dr Miyabe raised issues arising from SC7 including data gaps, regional observer programme data, the West Pacific East Asia Oceanic Fisheries Management (WPEA-OFM) Project, and research on species composition in purse seine sets.    Data Gaps"
WCPFC8,144,Dr Miyabe reflected discussions at SC7 regarding the importance of accurate and timely data for effective management.  These issues relate to adherence to the requirements of “Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission” as well as appropriate exchange of data with other bodies such as ISC.
WCPFC8,145,"FFA members encouraged CCMs to comply with the Commission’s data provision rules, and reminded CCMs of their obligation for those who are not to submit data improvement plans explaining what their national legal impediment is and how to resolve it."
WCPFC8,146,The EU stated that its data submissions for Pacific swordfish are now complete and the EU has now submitted all necessary data.   The EU supported port sampling as a means of improving scientific understanding of the fishery.
WCPFC8,147,WCPFC8 noted the recommendations of SC7 regarding data gaps.    Regional Observer Program
WCPFC8,148,Dr Miyabe informed WCPFC8 that SC7 recommended that the ongoing audits of ROP programmes continue.
WCPFC8,149,The EU asked that audit reports of the Regional Observer program be made available to all CCMs.
WCPFC8,150,WCPFC8 accepted the recommendation of SC7 that ROP audits continue.      20 WPEA-OFM Project
WCPFC8,151,Dr Miyabe informed WCPFC8 that SC7 noted the progress with the WPEA-OFM Project and supported the continuation this work.
WCPFC8,152,WCPFC8 accepted the recommendation of SC7 that work on the WPEA OFMP continue.    Species composition in purse seine nets
WCPFC8,153,"Dr Miyabe introduced WCPFC8-2011-IP/06 containing a plan for improvement of the availability and use of purse seine catch composition data.  He informed WCPFC8 that SC7 recommended a no-cost extension of Project 60 through 2012, and proposed that the financial status of this project be reviewed at SC8."
WCPFC8,154,WCPFC8 accepted the recommendation of SC7 for a no-cost extension of Project 60 through 2012.   6.1.6 Review of MOU between WCPFC and ISC
WCPFC8,155,"The Executive Director introduced a proposed revision to the MOU between WCPFC and ISC following direction from WCPFC7 to review the agreement and provide for WCPFC involvement in the north Pacific striped marlin assessment (WCPFC8-2011/38).  He noted that the desired revisions were not explicitly stated, and that the Secretariat considered that an amendment to Annex 3 – Annual Collaborative Work might be more appropriate than amending the main body of the MOU."
WCPFC8,156,Further discussion of this matter was referred to Agenda Item 11.1.   6.2 Programme of Work for the Scientific Committee in 2012-2014
WCPFC8,157,"Dr Miyabe informed WCPFC8 that SC7 had recommended that SPC provide four stock assessments (south Pacific albacore, south western Pacific striped marlin, oceanic white tip shark and silky shark) for the consideration of SC8.  In addition, indicator or reference case analyses are planned for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna and south Pacific swordfish."
WCPFC8,158,"FFA members expressed support for the four proposed stock assessments and for the indicator analyses, but noted that the further work on oceanic white tip sharks should not prevent adoption of a mitigation measure to reduce fishing mortality for this species at WCPFC8."
WCPFC8,159,Some CCM suggested that the results of the oceanic white tip shark stock assessment would need to be received before any decision could be made on mitigation measures for that species.
WCPFC8,160,The EU requested that work proceed on the south Pacific swordfish assessment now that the EU’s swordfish data submission is complete.
WCPFC8,161,"FFA members encouraged capacity building opportunities to be integrated into the budget for SC activities rather than limiting these opportunities to the Special Requirements Fund, the Japan Trust Fund and other such mechanisms."
WCPFC8,162,Some CCMs queried the potential need to re-prioritize the assessment work pending discussions on revisions to CMM 2008-01 at WCPFC8.    21
WCPFC8,163,"One CCM queried the need for a $30,000 allocation for harvest control rules and highlighted the need to agree on the TOR for the Management Objectives Workshop.  This CCM queried unobligated costs and various budget line items, and suggested that cost optimisation considerations should be applied to the SC work plan and budget in order to curb rising costs."
WCPFC8,164,"Further discussions on the SC work plan’s budget were deferred to, and resolved by, the FAC.   6.3 KOBE3 Workshop Recommendations on Science and Bycatch"
WCPFC8,165,Dr Miyabe noted a report on the science recommendations and outcomes of the Joint Technical Bycatch Working Group held at the Kobe III meetings in July 2011 (WCPFC8-2011/15) and invited WCPFC8 to comment.
WCPFC8,166,"FFA members confirmed their support for the Joint Technical Bycatch Working Group as an electronic working group.  However, they expressed concerns about the time and resources devoted to large plenary meeting associated with the Kobe process."
WCPFC8,167,Korea reminded WCPFC of its plan to hold a workshop on ecosystem and bycatch issues (see Agenda Item 3.3.1).
WCPFC8,168,"Canada articulated their commitment to advancing the Kobe recommendations.  While recognising the need for case-by-case considerations, Canada believes the Kobe process provides an opportunity to develop comparable measures among the t-RFMOs."
WCPFC8,169,WCPFC8 accepted the SC7 Report.  AGENDA  ITEM  7  -  NORTHERN COMMITTEE 7.1 Report of the Seventh Regular Session of the Northern Committee 7.1.1 Northern Committee Science Recommendations and Management Advice
WCPFC8,170,"Masanori Miyahara (Japan), Chairman of the Northern Committee, presented the report of the Northern Committee (WCPFC8-2011/16).  The two major themes of the meeting were a review of the implementation of existing measures, and making recommendations on the implementation of the observer programme for vessels fishing for fresh fish in the area north of 20 degrees north."
WCPFC8,171,"Regarding the implementation of existing measures, CMM 2010-04 for Pacific Bluefin tuna requires members, to ensure that the total fishing effort by their vessels shall stay below the 2002-04 level for 2011 and 2012 except for artisanal fisheries. Such measures shall include those to reduce juvenile mortality to 2002-2004 levels except for Korea.  Japan has implemented a purse seine catch limit for juveniles, a voluntary purse seine catch limit for adults, limits on set net licenses, and registration and reporting requirements for artisanal vessels and aquaculture sites.  Korea is implementing a prohibition on juvenile catch with several exemptions but is required to maintain total fishing effort at 2002-2004 levels.  Chinese Taipei has implemented a limit on the number of longline vessels and stated that its fisheries do not catch juveniles.     22"
WCPFC8,172,"With regard to the CMM for North Pacific albacore (CMM 2005-05), the Chair of the NC noted that the NC is progressing toward a revised management framework for this species based on the precautionary approach (see WCPFC8-2011/16, Attachment C)."
WCPFC8,173,"The Chair of the NC noted that the NC6’s proposal to WCPFC7 regarding observers for fresh fish vessels was not accepted, and a new proposal is from NC7 is provided to WCPFC8 as WCPFC8-2011/32.  This proposal implements the ROP for vessels fishing for fresh fish in the area north of 20 degrees north with a coverage of 5% to be achieved by the end of December 2014."
WCPFC8,174,The Chair of the NC stated that VMS issues for northern fisheries will be discussed at NC8.
WCPFC8,175,The USA drew WCPFC8’s attention to WCPFC8-2011-DP/12 on consolidation of proposed observer coverage levels based on CMM 2008-01 and the proposal from the NC (WCPFC8-2011/32).  The paper presents a proposal for a new CMM which would replace CMM 2007-01.
WCPFC8,176,Chinese Taipei expressed support for the proposal made by the Northern Committee and also supported  USA proposal for consolidation of observer requirements.
WCPFC8,177,Further discussion of the issue of observers for the northern fresh fish vessels was deferred to Agenda Item 9.2.3.
WCPFC8,178,FFA members expressed appreciation for the opportunity to participate in the NC.  These CCMs noted that the North Pacific striped marlin assessment was not completed as planned and looked forward to assessment results being provided next year.  The need for stronger measures for Pacific Bluefin tuna was highlighted and clarification on the timeframe of Korea’s exemptions for management of juvenile mortality was requested.
WCPFC8,179,Korea explained that it is not implementing the measures because it does not have any fisheries targeting Pacific Bluefin tuna.  A research project has been launched and once sufficient information is gathered Korea would like to participate in international management measures for this species.
WCPFC8,180,Mexico questioned the need and timeframe for the exemptions for the Japanese artisanal fleet and the Korean fleets.
WCPFC8,181,"The Chair of the NC explained that Japan’s artisanal fleet is comprised of a large number of small vessels with one or two fishermen on board.  The total catch of this sector has been stable for the past three to four decades.  With reference to Korean fleets, the exemption was requested to give Korea more time to understand how their fishery interacts with this species.  The Chair of the NC noted that Mexico has been asked to implement the CMM but no response has been received."
WCPFC8,182,Mexico stated that its catches of Pacific Bluefin tuna in the Eastern Pacific Ocean have also been stable for 20-30 years.       23 7.2 Programme of Work for the Northern Committee in 2012-2014
WCPFC8,183,The Chair of the NC informed WCPFC8 of the programme of work for the NC which is contained in Attachment E of the Report of NC7 (WCPFC6-2011/16).
WCPFC8,184,FFA members expressed support for the NC’s programme of work.
WCPFC8,185,WCPFC8 accepted the report of the Northern Committee and its programme of work.   AGENDA  ITEM  8  -  TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE ISSUES 8.1 Report of the Seventh Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee
WCPFC8,186,"Holly Koehler, Vice Chair of the TCC, presented the TCC7 report (WCPFC8-2011/17 (Rev 2)).  The TCC Vice Chair noted that a matrix of TCC7 summary report outcomes and recommendations had been produced by the Secretariat (WCPFC8-2011- IP09), which cross-references the relevant TCC7 outcome with the WCPFC8 agenda item and WCPFC8 papers where Commission action is requested or needed.  The TCC Vice Chair highlighted the following specific TCC7 outcomes and topics from the TCC7 Summary Report to WCPFC8: a. No new vessels were proposed for listing on the IUU Vessel List; b. One vessel on the IUU Vessel List (Senta) is proposed for de-listing;  c. The Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS) is operating as a one-year trial and is intended to produce a Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR) for the consideration of WCPFC8; d. As the trial period is ending, a decision will be required to extend and/or revise the CMS; e. TCC7 recommended that the deadline for Part 2 Annual Reports be revised from “30 days prior to TCC” to 1 July each year;   f. The results of a study on catch attribution issues and a review of the joint WCPFC/FFA VMS have been referred to the Commission for consideration; g. Terms of Reference for a Technical Advisory Group to support the work of the Regional Observer Programme were developed for the Commission’s consideration; h. Standards, specifications and procedures for the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels were endorsed and forwarded to the Commission; i. Regarding transhipment, a one-year extension to New Zealand’s transhipment exemption was recommended and the Secretariat will prepare a paper for TCC8 on the development of guidelines for high seas transhipment from fishing vessels other than purse seine vessels (see discussion under Agenda 8.7); j. It is noted that the charter notification scheme will expire at the close of the meeting unless extended by WCPFC8, and further work on issues related to charter State access to data is likely to be required; k. Issues relating to the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area were discussed and are presented under other agenda items; l. The TCC Work Programme has been revised intersessionally; m. Ms Rhea Moss-Christian of FSM is proposed as the new TCC Chair; n. TCC8 is proposed to be held in Pohnpei, FSM."
WCPFC8,187,WCPFC8 accepted the report of the TCC.    24 8.2 Proposed WCPFC IUU Vessel List for 2012
WCPFC8,188,"The TCC Vice Chair explained that no vessels were proposed to TCC for listing on the draft Provisional IUU Vessel List, therefore TCC focused its attention on whether any of the five currently listed vessels warranted de-listing (WCPFC-2011/18 (Rev 1)).  In response to a request and provision of information from Panama, the flag State of the Senta (now renamed Sun Fu Fa), TCC recommended that this vessel be removed from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.  TCC recommended that the other four vessels remain on the WPCFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC8,189,"Some CCMs expressed support for the de-listing of the Senta.  These CCMs noted that appropriate documentation had been provided by the flag State, the fine is considered sufficient, and the actions of Panama to resolve this situation have been proactive and should be encouraged."
WCPFC8,190,Other CCMs noted several concerns regarding de-listing of the Senta and requested further information from Panama.
WCPFC8,191,Panama provided additional information on the payment of the fine for the Sun Fu Fa (formerly Senta) in WCPFC8-2011-DP/43.
WCPFC8,192,"The EU and France stated that that the evidence provided does not provide sufficient information to delist, but not being the referring CCM, they abstain from the process to remove the Senta from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List. Both the EU and France considered that several of the conditions for removal have not been met:    a. There is insufficient evidence that Panama’s operation of VMS can ensure compliance with WCPFC CMMs. Moreover, no proof has been provided to ensure that transhipments (particularly at sea) will observe WCPFC rules; b. The amount of the fine imposed is not a sufficient deterrent, and the fact that ownership has changed should not be considered a reason to lower the amount of the fine; and c. There is insufficient evidence to establish that there has been a real change in vessel ownership."
WCPFC8,193,WCPFC8 agreed to remove Senta (now re-named Sun Fu Fa) from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC8,194,"Chinese Taipei requested that the Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 be de-listed on the basis that the vessel’s fishing license was revoked in 2010 and the vessel has been detained in port for over three years and if delisting proposal is not agreeable to some members, there should be a footnote in the IUU vessel list that indicates this vessel’s fishing license was revoked and this vessel has been detained in port for over 3 years."
WCPFC8,195,Chinese Taipei and the Federated States of Micronesia noted that discussions regarding the Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 were ongoing and some progress was being made.
WCPFC8,196,"WCPFC8 agreed that the Neptune, the Fu Lien No. 1, the Yu Fong 168 and the Jinn Feng Tsair No. 1 would remain on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.  The WCPFC IUU List for 2012 is appended as Attachment M.    25 8.3 Compliance with Conservation Measures 8.3.1 Update of Submission of Annual Reports Part 1 and Part 2"
WCPFC8,197,"WCPFC noted the Secretariat’s summary of CCMs’ submissions of Annual Reports Parts 1 and 2 (WCPFC8-2011/19), and WCPFC8 agreed to TCC7 recommendation that the deadline for Part 2 Annual Reports be revised from “30 days prior to TCC” to 1 July each year.   8.3.2 Report on the Compliance Monitoring Scheme (CMS)"
WCPFC8,198,"The TCC Vice Chair noted two issues for WCPFC8 concerning the Compliance Monitoring Scheme:  completion of the first trial period of the scheme, and amendment and/or extension of CMM 2010-03.  At TCC7, 22 CCM’s draft Compliance Monitoring Reports (CMRs) were considered.  After TCC7, nine of these CCM’s draft CMRs were updated based on supplemental information provided by the CCM or the Scientific Services Provider.  Twelve new draft CCM CMRs were developed by the Secretariat after TCC7.  The status of the CMR’s is detailed in WCPFC8-2011/20 and WCPFC8-2011-IP/09."
WCPFC8,199,"FFA members, noting their comments in WCPFC8-2011-DP/06, stated their support for the CMS but stressed the need to make the CMR evaluation process efficient so that SIDS can participate without undue burden.  These CCMs also requested that sub-regional bodies be allowed to participate in the evaluation to assist SIDS.  The importance of the CMRs as an evaluation of implementation and a means of identifying capacity building needs was also articulated.  FFA members supported the CMS but considered that it should be implemented with regard to the other priorities of the Commission and with fairness toward all CCMs, both large and small.  Continuation of the scheme was supported by these CCMs."
WCPFC8,200,"Other CCMs also confirmed their desire that CMS continue, but acknowledged that the resources available to support the process are limited and thus attention should be paid to improving efficiency."
WCPFC8,201,FSM expressed its strong reservation for what the Commission was being asked to endorse as the 2011 Compliance Monitoring Report. This reservation was based on the process followed in the development of the Report as well as the lack of a clear understanding for what the work was intended to produce from the outset. FSM expressed its willingness to work with all members in refining the CMR process and its final outcomes next year.
WCPFC8,202,"FSM also noted that in relation to the issue of late submission of Part 2 Reports and its impact on the ability for Provisional CMRs to be developed for some countries, there was a parallel process in 2011 of streamlining the Part 2 reports and reporting process that was designed in part to address the issue of timely reporting."
WCPFC8,203,"Citing a shortage of time and competing priorities, WCPFC8 agreed to convene a SWG led by the Vice Chair of the TCC work to complete the remaining twelve draft CCM CMRs and prepare a draft final CMR for adoption by WCPFC8, and discuss whether to amend and/or extend CMM 2010-03.  It was agreed that the sub-regional bodies consisting of FFA and PNA could participate in the work of the SWG as observers and in accordance with Rule 36 of the Commission’s Rules of Procedure.  It was also agreed to defer further discussion of the options for responses to non-compliance (WCPFC8-2011-DP/34) to TCC8.  It was agreed that the process and format that was used to prepare the 2010 reports does not in anyway constitute a  26 precedent for the future operation of the scheme (as also stated in the final compliance monitoring report for 2010)."
WCPFC8,204,"The SWG reported back to WCPFC8 that it could only complete five of the twelve new CCM CMRs (Vanuatu, Kiribati, RMI, Niue and Samoa; WCPFC8-2011-DP/51), therefore the draft final CMR it produced (WCPFC8-2011/51) provides a summary of 27 CCM CMRs.  This report includes a summary matrix of the degree of implementation by CMM, rather than by CCM, and highlights some CMMs for which there are potential implementation issues.  The report highlights issues and challenges in implementing the scheme and makes and makes suggestions for work to be undertaken in 2012, and future years, to address these issues."
WCPFC8,205,"WCPFC8 discussed the report of the SWG (WCPFC8-2011/51) and requested amendments to paras 5, 7 and 12.  With these amendments WCPFC8 adopted the Compliance Monitoring Report for 2010 (Attachment N)."
WCPFC8,206,"Several CCMs spoke in favour of extending the CMS for an additional trial year stating that it was a useful and importance exercise.  However, these CCMs emphasized the need for efficiency in terms of timely submission of CCM Annual Reports Parts 1 and 2, focused work by the SWG at TCC8 (particularly as both 2010 and 2011 compliance issues will need to be considered), and sufficient time available for TCC8 to consider the results of the SWG."
WCPFC8,207,"Australia noted that after three years of leading this process it is no longer in a position to lead the intersessional work required to further develop the Compliance Monitoring  Scheme. Australia suggested that the Commission consider an alternative to lead this process. Australia thanked Ms Camille Goodman, for her work in this regard.  The WCPFC Chair acknowledged the contribution of Ms Goodman.   8.3.3 Streamlined Part 2 Annual Reports"
WCPFC8,208,"The Executive Director noted that as described in WCPFC-2011/22, work on a streamlined template for Part 2 Annual Reports is proceeding, but the direction from TCC7 for a web-based format, as well as intersessional comments from CCMs on the template itself have budgetary implications."
WCPFC8,209,WCPFC8 noted these issues and deferred further discussions of financial aspects of the work on streamlined Part 2 Annual Reports to the Finance and Administration Committee.  The FAC considered the proposed budget to streamlining the Part 2 Annual report and the Commission approved the FAC’s recommendation.  The work on streamlined Part 2 Annual Report is included within the approved budget under Part 2.3 for “Information Management System including RFV”.   8.4 Regional Observer Programme 8.4.1 Annual Regional Observer Programme Report
WCPFC8,210,WCPFC8 noted the third annual report of the Regional Observer Programme (WCPFC8-2011/24).       27 8.4.2 Draft Terms of Reference for Technical Advisory Group-ROP for Approval
WCPFC8,211,The Chair noted that terms of reference for a Technical Advisory Group to support the work of the Regional Observer Programme were recommended by TCC7 for adoption (WCPFC8-2011/25).  Given the delay in holding WCPFC8 it was recommended that the TAG-ROP should perform its work through September 2013.
WCPFC8,212,The EU noted that the TAG-ROP will deal only with operational and technical issues in accordance with the draft Terms of Reference (paragraph 1 of the TOR)
WCPFC8,213,WCPFC8 approved the terms of reference for the TAG-ROP through September 2013 (Attachment O).  Mr Phillip Lens of Papua New Guinea was appointed TAG-ROP Chair.  8.4.3 WCPFC-IATTC Cross Endorsement of Observers
WCPFC8,214,The Chair noted that since WCPFC7 two meetings have been held between the two Secretariats on this issue (WCPFC-2011-IP/03 and; WCPFC8-2011-IP/03a) and that the Executive Directors are continuing to work together to progress these issues.
WCPFC8,215,"The EU stated their view that the situation was urgent and that immediate implementation of cross-endorsement procedures is required, particularly in view of the need for observers on vessels crossing the boundary between the two RFMOs.  The EU requested that the Secretariat provide further details on how the cross-endorsement Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) will operate and expedite organisation of training for observers to be cross-endorsed."
WCPFC8,216,"PNA members noted that measures applicable to purse seiners in EEZs, such as the PNA’s Third Implementing Arrangements, would take precedence over any cross-endorsement agreements.  These CCMs further noted that purse seine vessels are required to have 100% observer coverage and these observers must be sourced from the coastal States.  The need for more observers and more resources to train them was also highlighted."
WCPFC8,217,"The EU noted that in accordance with document made available to SC7 in August 2011, observer coverage on PS operating only in one Coastal State EEZ was not 100%."
WCPFC8,218,The Executive Director suggested that observers from French Polynesia and Kiribati be the focus for initial cross-endorsement training as these CCMs are members of both Commissions.
WCPFC8,219,"The IATTC Executive Director reminded WPCFC8 that since there are different requirements in different areas, further details need to be worked out beyond the general understanding which is now in place."
WCPFC8,220,The USA supported the quick implementation of WCPFC Executive Director’s suggestion and urged the arrangement to be put in place as soon as possible.  The USA drew CCM’s attention to the successful arrangement over the last ten years’ of AIDCP-trained observers crossing from west to east.  The USA stated it would continue to support an existing fund managed by the Secretariat for observer programme support.  It noted the cadre of special observers is another mechanism for training and maintaining a pool of cross-endorsed observers.     28
WCPFC8,221,"Noting the various issues involved, WCPFC8 directed the WPCFC Executive Director to continue to work with the IATTC Executive Director to implement an arrangement for the deployment of cross-endorsed observers as soon as possible.   8.4.4 Proposal for Vessel Captains/Operators to Review WCPFC ROP Reports"
WCPFC8,222,"The EU introduced a proposal by China, the EU, Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei on ensuring the availability of the report to the flag state and the opportunity for vessel captains/operators to review and comment on observer reports (WCPFC-2011-DP/36).  The EU described the motivation for the proposed amendment to CMM 2007-01 as arising from the need for flag States to receive timely information from the ROP in order to responsibly control their vessels.  The EU noted that it is for the observer provider and not directly for the observer to ensure that the timely provision of the preliminary observer reports to the captain vessel operator and the flag state and ensure the possibility for the captain/ vessel operator to comment on it. The EU noted that it was not need to present the report while the observer was still on board, it could be while the vessel is in port. The EU further noted that, since the beginning of the operations of the ROP, it has not received any observer reports."
WCPFC8,223,"Other CCMs supporting the proposal reiterated the importance of receiving timely feedback from the observers, explained that this feedback was not being received, and urged the Commission to avoid further delays in addressing this issue."
WCPFC8,224,"FFA members voiced concerns about observer safety and independence if the data were required to be provided before disembarking the vessel.  These CCMs noted that the flag States already have access to the observer reports (under CMM 2007-01, para 2 (l) of Annex A)."
WCPFC8,225,"The USA stated that it was generally supportive of the proposed amendment but also appreciated the difference between providing the reports to the Commission or national programme, and providing the reports to the captains of the vessels.  The USA advocated that a process (e.g. specifying timing, mechanism, etc.) which both protects the observer and delivers the necessary information to the flag State should be designed by the TAG-ROP for consideration by TCC."
WCPFC8,226,The EU stated that it is not a technical question but a political decision and therefore it is not under the competence of the TAG-ROP.
WCPFC8,227,"FFA spoke as an observer provider to the ROP noting that data are currently being provided to the flag States.  FFA believes there are ambiguities in the language of the proposal, and a significant danger that there would be retaliation against observers by previously observed vessels’ crew or related vessels’ crew."
WCPFC8,228,Other CCMs stressed that flag CCMs in fact could not receive observer data in a timely manner because data provision from observer provider to WCPFC have been often delayed as described in WCPFC 2011/24.
WCPFC8,229,"Noting that it is a requirement of CMM 2007-01, WCPFC8 referred the operational issues of provision of observer reports of observed vessels to the TAG-ROP for further discussion, however WCPFC8 noted that any policy discussions on this issue must be held within TCC and by the Commission.      29 8.5 Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) 8.5.1 Annual Report of the Vessel Monitoring System"
WCPFC8,230,The Chair drew the meeting’s attention to the Secretariat’s annual report on the VMS (WCPFC-2011/26) and review of VMS data integrity and security (WCPFC8-2011-IP/07).
WCPFC8,231,FFA members commented that the annual report was informative and highlighted operational issues and challenges.  These CCMs were pleased that an agreement with FFA for lower Service Level Agreement fees has been negotiated as this represents a cost savings to all WCPFC CCMs.
WCPFC8,232,"One CCM noted with concern that only 54% of vessels report to the WCPFC’s VMS, and that the basis for the SLA fee reduction was not clear."
WCPFC8,233,"The Executive Director clarified that the SLA fees were reduced by $300,000 through a detailed negotiation process.  Quarterly meetings continue to be held between the Secretariat and FFA to discuss VMS issues."
WCPFC8,234,One CCM asked the reasons for not distributing the VMS security audit of 2010 and about the follow up of the finding identified in the VMS security audit of 2010. It advocated for the VMS Security audit to be carried out in 2012..
WCPFC8,235,"The Executive Director noted that the 2010 audit was not completed by the external consultant.  Starting in 2012 an annual VMS audit will be undertaken and it will include an audit of the Commission’s data security rules, which are considered adequate, are being effectively implemented by the Secretariat.   8.5.2 Joint WCPFC/FFA Review of the WCPFC VMS"
WCPFC8,236,"Mr Robert Martinolich presented the independent review report (WCPFC-2011/27) explaining that it included visits to ten countries, with input from 21 individuals representing 13 organizations.  The objective of the review was to analyse the cost and structure of the current VMS arrangements in the Pacific to ensure they are delivering an effective service.  The following recommendations from the study were highlighted:  a. FFA and WCPFC should continue to work cooperatively and collaboratively; b. The objectives of the respective VMSs should be defined; c. Both organizations should work toward developing a central database;  d. Responsibilities should be migrated from commercial service providers to fishery management organizations; e. Data sharing procedures should be expanded to a wider range of users under strict confidentiality guidelines; f. WCPFC should adopt FFA’s approved ALC list; g. Costs should be reduced by reducing packet size, rationalising polling rates and eliminating redundant data transmissions; h. The SLA should be replaced with a legally binding agreement which is reviewed annually; and i. The SLA should be amended to allow the WCPFC to liaise directly with the service provider.    30  The overall findings of the review indicated that while there is room for improvement, the FFA is delivering on all components of the agreement and the VMS is meeting the basic needs of the Commission."
WCPFC8,237,The Executive Director presented the comments of a SWG convened at TCC on the recommendations of the independent review (WCPFC8-2011/36).  Seven recommendations were identified as high priority including cost reduction measures and amendment of the SLA.
WCPFC8,238,"Several CCMs, including the EU which provided a paper to WCPFC7 on this issue (WCPFC7-2010-DP29), stressed the importance and urgency of achieving cost savings and noted that some of the recommendations of the review report on reducing costs could be implemented immediately."
WCPFC8,239,"Some of these CCMs stated that they believe the objectives of the VMS are already adequately defined, and discussions on objectives or attributes should not delay the implementation of cost saving measures or add to the workload of TCC."
WCPFC8,240,"In response to a question, Mr Martinolich and the Executive Director explained that some of the VMS redundancies arise from the Commission’s original specifications to construct two separate systems (FFA and WCPFC) which can work together.  One way of reducing costs would be to merge these systems into one database with appropriate firewalls.  To the question of the EU whether there are further immediate savings that can be made beyond the reduction of fees by FFA, Mr Martinolich responded positively and mentioned as an example the reduction of the number of VMS messages packages from two to one. The EU requested to have this reflected in the summary record as a clear signal that other CCMs do not have as a priority the optimisation of high VMS costs."
WCPFC8,241,"FFA members noted that the review report confirms that the FFA is meeting all requirements for the VMS and that the joint VMS model is working.  These CCMs stated the importance of defining objectives for the VMS and referred WCPFC8 to a paper which outlines their ideas in this regard (WCPFC8-2011-DP/41).  FFA members proposed that the Commission task a SWG to work intersessionally by electronic means to:    a. Identify the needs, purposes and attributes of the Commission VMS; b. Review the existing VMS Standards, Specification and Procedures (SSPs) and CMM 2007-02 to determine if they meet the needs, purposes and attributes identified in (a) and if not, provide recommended changes to the SSPs and CMM 2007-02.    In addition, FFA members requested the Secretariat engage FFA to prepare the functional specifications and costs of the enhanced system envisaged by the TCC7 SWG (WCPFC8-2011/36) with consideration to meeting identified needs, avoiding duplication, protecting confidentiality and providing a “stand alone” system.  FFA members proposed Mr Colin Brown of the Cook Islands and Mr Stan Crothers of Tokelau as the Co-Chairs of the VMS SWG."
WCPFC8,242,Papua New Guinea pointed out the different issues involved when considering a VMS and an information management system.  It suggested that the Commission should be reciprocally sharing data with FFA just as FFA shares data with the Commission when vessels move from EEZs onto the high seas.     31
WCPFC8,243,Some CCMs expressed concerns about the cost implications of creating an information management system capable of data analysis.
WCPFC8,244,"In response to questions from CCMs, the Executive Director explained that the redundant system in Guam is for backup/data security purposes only and that the Secretariat is developing protocols for reducing polling rates for vessels entering EEZs or leaving the Convention Area in high seas areas."
WCPFC8,245,"WCPFC8 agreed to convene an intersessional SWG on VMS, co-chaired by Mr Colin Brown and Mr Stan Crothers to progress the two tasks identified in paragraph 229 above, related to the priority recommendations from the review report, for the consideration of TCC8.   8.5.3 VMS Template Agreement"
WCPFC8,246,"The USA introduced their proposal for a VMS template agreement (WCPFC8-2011-DP/30) explaining that the proposal has been modified based on comments received at TCC7.  Rather than proposing a template agreement per se, the current proposal contains language on key issues that, if agreed to by CCMs, would provide the basis for exchange of VMS data between national programmes and the Commission VMS."
WCPFC8,247,"RMI introduced their proposal (WCPFC8-2011-DP/40) which calls for the Commission VMS to provide data to coastal States when vessels on the Commission VMS enter the national waters of the coastal State.  This could either be accomplished through instructing the Secretariat to provide these data, or by amending the VMS SSPs to provide the data automatically.  RMI characterised this proposal at “flicking the switch” to allow coastal States to see the VMS data from vessels in their EEZs which are transmitting to the Commission’s VMS."
WCPFC8,248,"FFA members expressed their strong support for the RMI proposal and referred to key provisions in WCPFC documents which reinforce their position (WCPFC8-2011-DP/40).  FFA member comments highlighted the vulnerability of SIDS to encroachment by IUU fishing activities, and the importance of effective MCS tools such as VMS in combatting such activities.  These CCMs emphasized the urgent need for agreement to resolve this issue."
WCPFC8,249,"FSM expressed its disappointment that the proposed text on implementation of Article 24(8) was not accepted by all members and noted that it was currently moving toward implementing national legislation to require unlicensed vessels transiting through the FSM EEZ to report to the appropriate national authorities. FSM also commented that it has a signed bilateral agreement with the Commission Secretariat to receive Commission VMS data for its EEZ and that the agreement was put on hold after the Honolulu Commission meeting changed the template process. In that regard, the FSM supported Niue’s request to receive Commission VMS data for unlicensed vessels transiting their EEZ."
WCPFC8,250,"In response to questions from Canada, the Executive Director clarified that FFA members share their EEZ VMS data with each other through the FFA VMS.  RMI stated there would be no additional cost implications arising from adoption of their proposal and that the proposal is intended to apply to all vessels in the EEZs of coastal States whether they are fishing or transiting."
WCPFC8,251,"Some CCMs expressed concerns about the application of the proposal to vessels which are transiting and noted that while there were acceptable elements of both the USA and the RMI proposals, further discussion and drafting would be necessary to develop text that could be agreed.    32"
WCPFC8,252,France explained that its proposal for an EEZ entry-exit notification scheme (WCPFC8-2011-DP/19) is closely related to these issues and is designed to strengthen systems for monitoring of EEZs.  France suggested that discussions continue via an intercessional SWG.
WCPFC8,253,The EU stated that it is open to work for an agreement as far as it is in line with international law and UNCLOS rules.
WCPFC8,254,"The WCPFC Chair directed the USA, RMI and France, as well as other interested CCMs, to meet in the margins of WCPFC8 to explore the potential for a consolidated draft proposal."
WCPFC8,255,The USA and RMI developed a joint proposal that was circulated as WCPFC8-2011-DP/30 (Rev 3).
WCPFC8,256,"Some CCMs stated that while they understood the needs of the coastal States, they could not agree to the proposal as they had potential concerns regarding compliance with international law and insufficient time to examine the proposal in detail."
WCPFC8,257,RMI expressed disappointment with the position taken by some CCMs and noted that one option for coastal States would be to develop their own national VMSs.
WCPFC8,258,Other FFA members also expressed their disappointment.
WCPFC8,259,Niue asked that data from all CCM-flagged vessels present in the EEZ of Niue and reporting to the Commission’s VMS be provided to Niue.
WCPFC8,260,Some CCMs stated their support for Niue’s request.
WCPFC8,261,The Cook Islands suggested that there is a need for a technical working group to ensure consistency between individual requests from SIDS for Commission VMS data in their EEZs.
WCPFC8,262,France informed WCPFC8 that it appreciated the work that had been done to progress the issues associated with the VMS template agreement as such work may address be able to address the concerns which prompted it to develop the EEZ entry-exit notification scheme proposal.
WCPFC8,263,WCPFC8 agreed that the Commission would provide Niue with VMS data for fishing vessels present in the Niue EEZ which are reporting to the Commission VMS.
WCPFC8,264,WCPFC8 agreed that the joint US and RMI proposal WCPFC8-2011-DP/30 (Rev 3) be further elaborated at TCC8.
WCPFC8,265,NOTE: Please note Circular No 2012/?? Concerning the Chairs final decision regarding this issue. 8.5.4 VMS ALC/MTU Template Checklist for Auditing Units
WCPFC8,266,WCPFC8 was informed that the Secretariat has developed an audit template for use by CCMs when conducting periodic audits of a representative sample of installed ALCs/MTUs (WCPFC-2011/28 (Rev 1)).     33
WCPFC8,267,Japan thanked the Secretariat for the template but stated that it might not use the exact format for the reporting to the Secretariat since it might be necessary to modify it for domestic use.
WCPFC8,268,FFA members stated that some amendments to the draft template would be required to align it with CMM 2007-02.
WCPFC8,269,"The WCPFC Chair requested CCMs to provide comments on the template to the Secretariat, and directed the Secretariat to present a revised draft of the template to TCC8.   8.5.5 VMS SSP Bracketed Text"
WCPFC8,270,"WCPFC8 noted that TCC8 discussed issues related to manual reporting requirements in the VMS SSPs, and the bracketed text in the VMS SSPs, remain unresolved."
WCPFC8,271,WCPFC8 referred further discussion of the issues associated with bracketed text in the VMS SSPs to TCC8.   8.5.6 Proposed Amendment to CMM 2007-02 VMS
WCPFC8,272,WCPFC8 noted TCC’s recommendation to revise CMM 2007-02 to remove the requirement for “a single length of unbroken cable to the antenna” in the Draft Minimum Standards for ALCs used in the Commission VMS (WCPFC-2011-DP/31).
WCPFC8,273,"WCPFC8 adopted the revised CMM 2007-02 on the Commission Vessel Monitoring System contained in WCPFC8-2011-DP/31, as CMM 2011-02 (Attachment P).   8.6 Record of Fishing Vessels (RFV) – Standards, Specification and Procedures"
WCPFC8,274,"The USA introduced a proposal, endorsed by TCC7, to institute standards, specifications and procedures for the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC-2011/37).  The USA explained that the intent of the proposal is to produce a RFV which is as accurate and cost-effective as possible."
WCPFC8,275,"Some CCMs, citing the endorsement by TCC7, supported the proposal as presented."
WCPFC8,276,"FFA members supported some components of the proposal but expressed some reservations about the procedures included, in particular whether there should be requirements for minimum fields.  FFA members suggested that a decision on this issue be deferred to allow for further discussion."
WCPFC8,277,"The EU questioned whether the RFV can be used to provide the Commission with information on the number of vessels actively fishing in the Convention Area.  If so, the EU requested that this information is provided to TCC8 and WCPFC9 and on a yearly basis in all future WCPFC meetings."
WCPFC8,278,WCPFC Compliance Manager confirmed that the RFV can be used for this purpose and this information can be provided to both TCC8 and the WCPFC9 based on the CCM reports under CMM 2009-01 paragraph 9 (“fished” or “did not fish” reports).     34 8.7 NZ Transhipment Approval
WCPFC8,279,"The Chair, noting the paper provided by New Zealand (WCPFC8-2011-DP/02), recalled that TCC7 recommended to WCPFC8 that New Zealand’s application for an exemption from the prohibition on at-sea transhipment from purse seine vessels be approved."
WCPFC8,280,FFA members voiced their support for New Zealand’s application on the grounds that the conditions for exemption as provided for in CMM 2009-06 have been met.  These CCMs suggested that a multi-year (rather than annual) exemption could be considered to improve the efficiency of Commission decision-making.
WCPFC8,281,"These CCMs also stated their concerns regarding transhipments from longline vessels which, under CMM 2009-06, have a variety of requirements, including notification to the Secretariat, and which do not appear to be consistently adhered to.  These issues should be addressed through revision of the CMM including consideration of a ban on high seas transhipments."
WCPFC8,282,"The Executive Director noted that from the inception of the CMM 2009-06 (July 1 2010) until October 2011 the Secretariat received 878 notifications of transhipment.  The scale of this activity was somewhat surprising and has prompted the Secretariat to consider potential linkages between transhipment and IUU fishing activities.  In accordance with paragraph 37 of CMM 2009-06, the Secretariat will prepare a paper for TCC8 on guidelines for high seas transhipment from fishing vessels other than purse seines (WCPFC8-2011-IP/08)."
WCPFC8,283,Other CCMs also supported New Zealand’s application but considered than an annual exemption process is most appropriate.
WCPFC8,284,WCPFC8 approved New Zealand’s application for an exemption from the prohibition on at-sea transhipment from purse seine vessels for a one-year period until the 29th of May 2013.   8.8 Kobe III Outcomes Capacity and IUU Listings
WCPFC8,285,"The Executive Director presented the compliance and management recommendations of the Kobe III meeting held in La Jolla, USA in July 2011 (WCPFC-2011/29).  One of these recommendations is being presented to WCPFC8 as a proposal by the EU, Japan and the USA on the management of purse seine fishing capacity (see WCPFC8-2011-DP/52 and Agenda Item 14).  He noted that the Kobe process will continue as a meeting of the Chairs and Executive Directors of the tuna RFMOs at COFI in July 2012, and that input from CCMs was sought to inform this upcoming meeting."
WCPFC8,286,"FFA members noted with satisfaction the recognition of the rights and aspiration of SIDS embodied in the Kobe III recommendations.  These CCMs look forward to learning what steps CCMs will take in light of these recommendations, the requirements of Article 30 of the Convention, and Resolution 2008-01.  FFA members also supported the improved harmonization of t-RFMO IUU Vessel Lists."
WCPFC8,287,"The USA added that they would like to see the Kobe III process undertake further work on issues of fishing capacity, IUU Vessel Lists, decision rules on management measures, unique vessel identifiers and records of fishing vessels, and consistent compliance and capacity building procedures across the t-RFMOs.    35 8.9 Programme of Work for the Technical and Compliance Committee in 2012-2014"
WCPFC8,288,"The Executive Director drew WCPFC8’s attention to the draft TCC work programme for 2012-2014 (WCPFC-2011/30), noting that it had been revised based on FFA comments received subsequent to TCC7 (WCPFC8-2011-DP/08) and was under discussion in the FAC with regard to the financial implications of the streamlined Annual Report template."
WCPFC8,289,"Japan considered that it is premature to assume that the outcome of direct entry of observer data would result in a cost savings, and questioned the need to expend $35,000 on this item.  Japan also stated that it strongly supported calls for streamlining and prioritisation of the work of the TCC."
WCPFC8,290,The Executive Director agreed that this item should be removed from the 2012 budget pending a full evaluation of the observer data direct entry trials.
WCPFC8,291,"The USA stated its view that the TCC work plan was a helpful exercise but advocated that the Commission should identify the priority tasks for the TCC and these should be the basis of the TCC work plans. The USA supported the priorities identified by the FFA in WCPFC8-2011-DP/08 but also considered that port state measures, the catch documentation scheme and the continuation of the CMS were also priorities."
WCPFC8,292,"The Chair directed the Secretariat to take account of these comments when revising the TCC Work Plan for presentation toTCC8.   AGENDA  ITEM  9  -  CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES 9.1 New CMMs 9.1.1 CMM 2011-01 for Bigeye, Skipjack and Yellowfin Tuna (CMM 2008-01)"
WCPFC8,293,"Dr John Hampton of SPC, the WCPFC Scientific Services Provider, presented a review of the implementation of effectiveness of CMM 2008-01 (WCPFC8-2011/43 (Rev 1)).  Dr Hampton explained that the paper consists of two parts:  a review of the implementation of measures pertaining to purse seine effort, FAD closure, high seas pocket closures, and longline catch; and generic and specific projections of future conditions based on results of the 2011 stock assessments (i.e. 2010 conditions)."
WCPFC8,294,"Dr Hampton noted that assessment of the ability of the measure to reduce purse seine effort by 30% from 2001-2004 or 2004 levels did not take into account effort by purse seine fleets based in Indonesia or the Philippines because of the lack of purse seine effort data from those fleets.  The conclusion of the assessment is that CMM 2008-01 has not been effective in restricting total purse seine effort:  in 2009 effort increased by 13%, in 2010 effort increased by 18% and in 2011 (based on VMS data, as logsheet data have not yet been compiled) effort increased by 31% over the baseline."
WCPFC8,295,"Evaluation of the FAD closures was based on data from 2009-2010 only.  Observers reported that the days during which there were reports of activities associated with drifting FADs during the FAD closure period were 14% for 2009 and 5.8% for 2010.  Observers also reported greater use of fish aggregation lights during night time in the FAD closure in 2010 (6.2%) versus 2009 (2.2%).  An unusual pattern was observed in 2010 when FAD usage remained low even after the FAD closure period ended.  During the closure periods catches of skipjack and yellowfin  36 tuna declined slightly (though sizes increased so catch value remained nearly constant), but there was a notable decline in the catch of bigeye tuna.  This is due to the fact that very few bigeye tuna are caught in unassociated purse seine sets."
WCPFC8,296,"Dr Hampton noted that historically purse seine effort within the high seas pockets represented 14% of managed purse seine effort, but that based on logsheet, observer and VMS data high seas pocket effort has been eliminated.  However, it is likely that much of this effort has been transferred to other areas, rather than completely removed from the fishery.  An exception to this is the catch reduction by the Philippines which is likely to be directly attributable to the high seas pocket closures.  Although it is thus not likely that high seas pocket effort was eliminated from the fishery, it is worthwhile considering whether total effort would have been even higher if the high seas pockets had remained open."
WCPFC8,297,"Another objective of CMM 2008-01 was to reduce longline catch by 30% from baseline periods of 2001-2004 or 2004.  The assessment showed that catches have declined since 2008 and that 2010 catches represented a 23% reduction on the 2001-2004 average.  If the trend of reduced catches continued in 2011, CMM 2008-01 is likely to meet its objective.  However, this decrease in catches has occurred despite the fact that effort has remained constant; this raises the possibility that the catch reductions are due to stock declines."
WCPFC8,298,"In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the measure, projections were made using a variety of assumptions (WCPFC8-2011/43a and WCPFC8-2011/43b).  Projections based on conditions in 2009 showed that fishing mortality for bigeye tuna remained well above MSY levels.  In contrast, projections based on conditions in 2010, which incorporated a 17% decrease in longline catch, a 32% decrease in purse seine FAD effort, and a 33% decrease in catch by Indonesia and Philippines fleets from 2009 leves, resulted in the stock attaining MSY levels by the end of the 10 year projection."
WCPFC8,299,"Evaluation of total purse seine closures versus FAD closures found little difference between the two with regard to effects on the bigeye tuna stock.  This is because most bigeye tuna are caught in associated sets, therefore allowing the unassociated portion of the fishery to remain in operation has little effect on bigeye tuna catches.  In contrast, total tuna catch is expected to decrease from 2.3 million t to 1.8 million t under a total purse seine fishery closure scenario."
WCPFC8,300,"Finally, Dr Hampton’s analysis evaluated the influence of exemptions on the effectiveness of CMM 2008-01.  The exemptions were modelled as scaling factors (scalars) as described in WCPFC7-2010/15 but applied to the latest stock assessment results.  Removal of the exemptions was estimated to potentially remove approximately 50% of the overfishing estimated to occur under CMM 2008-01."
WCPFC8,301,"In response to questions posed by Japan, Dr Hampton clarified that the fish aggregation lights reported by observers were underwater lights.  He also explained that the reported differences in catch during closure and non-closure periods, and reported differences in fish sizes, had taken account of sampling bias and stratification and were thus valid.  Dr Hampton stated that the VMS data used as a proxy for effort in 2011 should be representative of fishing effort related to the increase in small longliners fishing in the Convention Area.  With regard to the modelling of the total closure of the purse seine fishery, Dr Hampton clarified that that three months of effort (i.e. during the closure) were assumed to be removed from the fishery rather than transferred to other (non-closure) months.     37"
WCPFC8,302,FFA members considered that the results presented by Dr Hampton confirmed that additional measures are required to reduce the overfishing of bigeye tuna.
WCPFC8,303,"Chinese Taipei noted the ease of enforcement of a total closure and suggested that when modelling the total closure of the purse seine fishery it would have been more realistic to model a 2.4 month closure rather than a 6 month closure.  Similarly, when modelling the high seas pocket closure it was suggested to assume that effort is redistributed rather than eliminated.  Finally, it was noted that using VMS data as a proxy for logbook data may tend to overestimate effort."
WCPFC8,304,"Dr Hampton replied that the methodology for using VMS data to estimate effort is in the early stages of development, and is being used as a relative rather than as an absolute index of effort."
WCPFC8,305,"The EU asked 1) whether the projects that compare respectively a total seasonal closure and a seasonal FAD closure assume perfect implementation of each closure option, 2) whether, if the projections assumed better implementation of the total seasonal closure than the FAD closure, the conservation benefits to bigeye would be even greater than in the current projection which assume equal implantation of the two types of closures; and 30 whether, since 2009, when CMM 2008/01 came into force, the purse seine fishing effort that falls under the various exemptions has grown or remained stable."
WCPFC8,306,"In response to the questions from the EU, Dr Hampton clarified that currently received and processed purse seine observer data represent a coverage rate of about 50% of the total purse seine effort, and that as long as this coverage is representative valid conclusions can be drawn.  He reiterated that 2010 was an unusual year because there was a very low rate of reported FAD usage.  SPC uses a statistical methodology to estimate the species composition for associated and unassociated sets.  Dr Hampton clarified that natural log and debris sets are considered to be associated (i.e. FAD) sets in the analysis.  In response to concerns that La Niña conditions have shifted fishing effort to the west and into areas of higher scientific uncertainty (e.g. archipelagic waters) and higher potential conservation value (e.g. spawning areas), Dr Hampton explained that there are ample observer data for the archipelagic waters of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and that purse seine catches contain a higher proportion of bigeye tuna in the east than in the west."
WCPFC8,307,"In response to a question from Nauru regarding whether the assessment of the high seas pocket closure took account of the effort of the Philippines fleet, Dr Hampton replied that there is no direct measure of effort by the Philippines fleet since 2004.  Nevertheless, catches in 2010 showed a 30% reduction and this is likely to be related to the removal of the Philippines fleet’s effort from the western high seas pocket."
WCPFC8,308,"In response to a question from China regarding the overall magnitude of the bigeye tuna catch by the purse seine fleet, Dr Hampton noted that the proportion of the total purse seine catch that is bigeye tuna is small, however, this purse seine catch represents approximately half of the bigeye tuna catch within the WCPF Convention Area."
WCPFC8,309,China stated that it considers that the total catch of bigeye tuna is probably underestimated.
WCPFC8,310,PNA members noted that a greater focus on unassociated purse seine sets would likely reduce fishing mortality on bigeye tuna and should be encouraged.    38
WCPFC8,311,Korea requested confirmation that the outcome for bigeye tuna of a total purse seine closure versus a FAD closure is very similar.
WCPFC8,312,Dr Hampton reiterated that this is the case because most bigeye tuna are caught in associated sets which are prohibited during both the FAD closure and the total closure.
WCPFC8,313,"The EU queried whether La Niña conditions weakened in 2011 and whether bigeye tuna are more vulnerable to the east or simply more abundant, since longline catch rates are also higher in the East. The EU also noted that big eye tuna is indeed more vulnerable to purse seine in the eastern portion of the fishing grounds."
WCPFC8,314,"Dr Hampton confirmed that these points appear to be true, and stated that there is some evidence from tagging data that bigeye tuna are indeed more vulnerable to purse seine in the eastern portion of the fishing grounds."
WCPFC8,315,"In response to a suggestion from Japan that perhaps the observed increase in size in yellowfin tuna is due to a shift toward a greater number of unassociated sets, Dr Hampton noted that a high proportion of unassociated sets continued even after the FAD closure period ended."
WCPFC8,316,"In response to requests and comments from CCMs across the floor, the WCPFC Legal Advisor provided his opinion on which components of CMM 2008-01 would expire as of the close of WCPFC8 (see WCPFC8-2011/44 and WCPFC8-2011/45) based on a textual interpretation of the measure as a whole (WCPFC8-2011/47).  Dr Tsamenyi considered that:    a. the preamble, objectives and rules of general application (paras 1-7) are not time bound and do not expire.  However some of these paragraphs are linked to subsequent paragraphs which expire and thus may become redundant or may require revision; b. the purse seine provisions for 2009 (paras.11-22), including the provisions on closure of the high seas pockets are time bound and therefore expire; and c. the longline fishery measures (paras.31-38) are also time bound and expire."
WCPFC8,317,The WCPFC Chair concluded that there could be many different legal interpretations regarding the expiry of CMM 2008-01 components but that this did not prevent WCPFC8 from entering into discussions on improving the measure.
WCPFC8,318,"FFA members introduced their paper containing proposals for the new measure (WCPFC8-2011-DP/09) and responded to the Chair’s draft contained in WCPFC8-2011/31.  While these CCMs considered the Chair’s draft a worthwhile basis for discussion, they noted that exemptions for SIDS had not been included and that by transferring a disproportionate burden to SIDS that the proposal was inconsistent with Article 30 of the Convention.  These CCMs also considered that additional measures, beyond those required in CMM 2008-01 would be required to reduce overfishing of bigeye tuna and protect skipjack stocks.  They noted that the PNA’s ban on high seas fishing by those purse seiners operating in PNA waters would continue and as such they would expect to see compatible measures implemented by the WCPFC.  FFA members also supported the development of reference points and the USA proposal to allow elements of CMM 2008-01 to continue to be in effect until a new measure is adopted.  These CCMs saw merit in some other CCM proposals such as the EU’s proposal to levy fees for high seas fishing, the USA’s proposal for transfers of catch limits among CCMs, and Japan’s support for PNA management measures in tropical waters.     39"
WCPFC8,319,The USA stated that its position with regard to CMM 2008-01 was to ensure that stocks are managed based on the best available science and application of the precautionary principle (WCPFC8-2011-DP/14).  The USA also emphasized the importance of compliance monitoring and the ability to assess the effectiveness of the measure in order for the work of the Commission to be transparent and accountable.
WCPFC8,320,"The EU summarized its views, presented in WCPFC8-2011-DP/24, WCPFC8-2011-DP/25 and WCPFC8-2011-DP/38, and stated that it considered that CMM 2008-01 had not been effective.  A total purse seine closure (rather than a FAD closure) was recommended as it would be easier to enforce.  The EU also advocated strengthening the requirements for FAD management plans, a freeze on capacity of non-SIDS flag State purse seine capacity at 2010 levels, and re-opening of the high seas pockets with fees paid by users of the pockets supporting a fund to enhance border States’ MCS capabilities.  In response to the suggestion that greater control on fishing effort was needed in high seas areas, the EU pointed out that most of the catch occurred in EEZs.  Therefore, it is important to verify that the VDS is aligned with the scientific advice and is functioning in an effective and transparent manner.  The effort reduction required under CMM 2008-01 can also not be met if the effort in the EEZs is maintained at 2010 levels."
WCPFC8,321,"Japan expressed its concern regarding the pole and line skipjack fishery in its waters which is diminishing substantially year by year.  Although range contraction has been suggested as an explanation, Japan believes the stock is being depleted and asked the Commission to take measures in tropical waters to prevent further depletion.  With regard to the need to limit longline fishing effort, Japan noted that this has already been reduced by 30% through actions by Japan, Chinese Taipei and Korea, while effort in the purse seine fishery has increased by a similar amount.  Japan referred to its proposal for capacity limits (WCPFC8-2011-DP/52, see Agenda Item 14), and the proposal by RMI (WCPFC8-2011-DP/39), as useful steps toward controlling purse seine effort."
WCPFC8,322,RMI presented its proposal on capacity reduction which consists of two components:  capping the number of purse seine vessels at 220; and transferring those vessels to PNA members according to a pre-agreed allocation plan (WCPFC8-2011-DP/39).  RMI noted that their proposal addresses both the need to reduce fishing effort to maintain stocks and the need to acknowledge the fishery development rights and aspirations of SIDS.
WCPFC8,323,The Philippines stated that the closure of the western high seas pocket caused fishing effort to shift into the Philippines EEZ and resulted in greater impacts on spawning stocks.  It proposes to limit its fishing effort in the western high seas pocket (HSP1) to 36 ice boats which will comply with all WCPFC CMMs (WCPFC8-2011-DP/42).
WCPFC8,324,Nauru proposed to prohibit distant-water longline fishing within the fully-enclosed high seas pockets between 10oN and 20oS.  Nauru noted that this proposal could have a positive effect on bigeye tuna stocks as well as reduce the potential for IUU fishing by making it more difficult for unlicensed longline vessels to encroach on the EEZs surrounding the pockets (WCPFC8-2011-DP/45).
WCPFC8,325,"PNA members stated their view that the PNA has taken strong measures to control the purse seine fishery and it is now time for the longline fishery to take action to protect bigeye tuna stocks.  It was noted that while CMM 2008-01 may expire, PNA management measures will continue and in addition, PNA members are developing a longline vessel day scheme.  With regard to the Chair’s draft for CMM 2011-01, PNA members considered that SIDS exemptions  40 had been wrongly omitted, and that a three-month FAD closure and the high seas pocket closure should continue."
WCPFC8,326,PNA members also referred to their proposal for WCPFC to close all high seas areas between 10oN and 20oS latitude and 170oE and 150oW longitude to purse seine fishing (WCPFC8-2011-DP/01).  These CCMs noted that the Commission’s control of high seas areas was lagging behind PNA members’ control of the EEZs and resulting in a continuing potential to use the high seas pockets as havens for IUU fishing.
WCPFC8,327,"The United States reminded delegates of their position on the circumstances of the Hawaii fresh longline fleet, which was reflected in CMM 2008-01 paragraph 35. (Attachment Q)"
WCPFC8,328,American Samoa associated itself and the other US territories with the previously articulated aspirations of SIDS to develop and diversify fisheries in a responsible manner.
WCPFC8,329,"WCPFC8 continued discussion of CMM 2008-01 and the Chair’s draft (WCPFC8-2011/46 ) in a series of SWG sessions chaired by the WCPFC Vice Chair, Mr Matthew Hooper of New Zealand.  A revised draft measure was produced and circulated as WCPFC8-2011/46 (Rev 1)."
WCPFC8,330,WCPFC8 then agreed to convene a heads of delegation meeting to develop a temporary measure based on a subset of issues on which agreement could be reached.  The results of these discussions were circulated as WCFPC8-2011/53.
WCPFC8,331,PNA members noted that the temporary measure required a polling rate of every half hour during the FAD closure.  They reminded WCPFC8 that PNA required polling every hour and questioned whether VMS costs would rise.
WCPFC8,332,"The EU responded that according to its calculations costs would rise by $23,000 per year.  The EU considered that this amount was reasonable given the additional assurance of compliance the higher polling rate would provide."
WCPFC8,333,"As CCMs could not reach agreement on a polling rate, the requirement to increase the polling rate was deleted from the temporary measure."
WCPFC8,334,"Discussion across the floor clarified that the intention of WCPFC8 was for the entire CMM 2008-01 measure, with the exception of 17a and 22, to remain in effect until 28 February 2013."
WCPFC8,335,Mexico questioned the appropriateness of imposing a catch limit on China in the WCPFC-IATTC overlap area.
WCPFC8,336,"CCMs noted other minor clarifications and wording changes including replacing “catcher vessels” with “fishing vessels” (throughout the document), changing “proposes to limit” to “shall limit” (para. 10), specifying where text refers to Philippine vessels only, and other typos to be corrected in the final editing of the temporary measure."
WCPFC8,337,"WCPFC8 adopted the draft decision document (WCPFC8-2011/53), as amended through discussion (CMM 2011-01, Attachment R), as a temporary extension of CMM 2008-01 until 28 February 2013 given the expiry of elements of CMM 2008-01.  The Chair  41 committed to a process to have a new measure developed prior to WCPFC9 based on comments from WCPFC8."
WCPFC8,338,"The WCPFC Chair, noting the advice of the Legal Advisor at the Heads of Delegation meeting on the potential options concerning the application of Article 20 (5) of the Convention, confirmed the general understanding of WCPFC8 that the decision will take immediate effect following WCPFC8 (commencing 31 March 2012).  WCPFC8 agreed that waiving of the 60 day rule in Article 20(5) of the Convention shall not be a precedent.     9.2 Consideration of new measures and other conservation requirements 9.2.1 Port State Measures"
WCPFC8,339,"The EU introduced its proposal for a CMM on port state measures (WCPFC8-2011-DP/26 and WCPFC8-2011-DP/27).  As the FAO Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) requires ratification by another 21 States before it can enter into force, the EU is promoting a regional approach to implementing port state measures as a tool for combatting IUU fishing.  The EU proposal is based on the FAO PSMA and has been modified since TCC7 based on comments received from FFA."
WCPFC8,340,"FFA members stated their support for port state measures but expressed reservations about using the FAO PSMA as the basis for a WCPFC CMM.  These CCMs considered that the EU’s proposal duplicates tools in place through the WCPFC, regionally or nationally; places undue burdens on SIDS to implement the measures; and presents loopholes and inconsistencies.  FFA members suggested that a gap analysis should first be conducted to identify what needs a port state measure should fulfil."
WCPFC8,341,"Several CCMs expressed support for a port state measure which is appropriate for the WCPFC fisheries and CCMs’ capacity to implement, and suggested that more work would be necessary before WCPFC could agree a new CMM which could be effectively implemented by its members."
WCPFC8,342,The Pew Environment Group stated that it has conducted a gap analysis and offered to assist CCMs with understanding the needs and opportunities for implementing port state measures.
WCPFC8,343,The EU noted that this gap analysis has already been conducted and questioned what more analysis was necessary.
WCPFC8,344,The WCPFC Chair suggested that CCMs continue to work intersessionally toward developing a proposal on port state measures for the consideration of TCC8.  CCMs were encouraged to provide further comments or proposals to the Secretariat.
WCPFC8,345,WCPFC8 agreed to continue to work intersessionally toward developing a proposal on port state measures for the consideration of TCC8.     42 9.2.2 Prohibition of Purse Seine Fishing Associated with Whale Sharks and Cetaceans
WCPFC8,346,WCPFC8 noted the information paper provided by the Scientific Services Provider concerning purse seine interactions with whale sharks and cetaceans (WCPFC8-2011-IP/01).
WCPFC8,347,"Australia presented a proposal for two a draft CMM’s protecting whale sharks and cetaceans from purse seine fishing operations (WCPFC8-2011-DP/15) noting that these interactions are of ongoing conservation concern and are beginning to draw criticism from international markets.  The proposals have two components:  a ban on intentional setting on whale sharks and cetaceans, and requirements for safe release of animals encircled unintentionally."
WCPFC8,348,FFA members supported Australia’s proposal stating that these animals are iconic and should not be intentionally set upon.  These CCMs noted that mortality occurs both in intentional and inadvertent sets.
WCPFC8,349,"The USA explained that it has domestic laws, enacted over two decades ago, which prohibit setting on live or dead cetaceans, but that whale shark issues have emerged more recently.  The USA strongly supported the CMMs for both animals but wished to provide some suggestions to the text."
WCPFC8,350,"Japan stated that it supported the spirit of the CMM to avoid injury or mortality to whale sharks and cetaceans.  However, Japan noted that there would be difficulties associated with enforcing the measure since it would be impossible to determine whether or not setting was intentional.  Japan referred WCPFC8 to its proposals for safe and live release of encircled cetaceans (WCPFC8-2011-DP/16) and whale sharks (WCPFC8-2011-DP/17) during purse seine operations."
WCPFC8,351,PNA members reminded WPCFC8 that there is an existing prohibition on setting purse seines on whale sharks and cetaceans in their EEZs.  These CCMs requested the Commission to extend this prohibition to the high seas and the remainder of the fishery.  The Third Implementing Arrangement reads: “ No purse seine vessel shall engage in fishing or related activity in order to catch tuna associated with whale sharks”
WCPFC8,352,FFA members thanked Japan for the safe release guidelines but requested more time to consult experts on these issues.  These CCMs also stated that release guidelines are not an alternative to the prohibition on intentional sets but they would be useful for unintentional encirclements.
WCPFC8,353,"Several CCMs supported the safe release guidelines but expressed concerns, similar to those of Japan, regarding the ability of purse seine vessels to detect these animals before setting when enforcing the measure."
WCPFC8,354,"While noting some potential difficulties for enforcement, several CCMs expressed support for both the proposed CMM and the safe release guidelines, noting that the latter could be taken as a starting point with amendments proposed as further technical information becomes available."
WCPFC8,355,"In response to some CCMs’ concerns about enforcing the measure, New Zealand suggested that the measure be supported by education and compliance efforts which would be facilitated by the requirement for 100% observer coverage.    43"
WCPFC8,356,"The USA informed WCPFC8 that it had many years of successful enforcement experience with its own law which bans sets on live or dead cetaceans.  The USA is conducting its own consultations on safe release guidelines but it is finding that there is little scientific information currently available.  The USA suggested that SC or TCC be tasked with developing a research programme, perhaps involving tagging, to evaluate and verify the effectiveness of preliminary safe release guidelines."
WCPFC8,357,Mexico stated its strong support for the proposal noting that intentional sets do occur and recommending the use of experience in other RFMOs when developing best practice release guidelines.
WCPFC8,358,French Polynesia informed WCPFC8 that these species are already protected in their waters.
WCPFC8,359,The Philippines noted that whale shark interactions are prohibited under Philippine law.
WCPFC8,360,Chinese Taipei noted that whale shark catches are prohibited in their waters.
WCPFC8,361,"Australia considered that the discussion reflected a consensus on the need to act.  It stated that the concerns about enforcement difficulties based on determining intention can be dealt with using observer reports.  Australia also recognized the need for crew safety and training, and agreed to resolve inconsistencies between the proposals for whale sharks and cetaceans."
WCPFC8,362,"After discussions in the margins, Australia circulated revised proposals for whale sharks (WCPFC8-2011-DP/15a (Rev 1)) and cetaceans (WCPFC8-2011-DP/15b (Rev 2))."
WCPFC8,363,"WPCFC8 adopted a Conservation and Management Measure to address the impact of purse seine fishing activity on cetaceans (WCPFC8-2011-DP/15b (Rev 2)).  (Attachment S, CMM 2011-03)"
WCPFC8,364,Japan stated that it could not support the measure for whale sharks without further consideration.
WCPFC8,365,Some CCMs expressed their disappointment that the measure for whale sharks was not adopted.
WCPFC8,366,"The Humane Society and Shark Advocates International stated their support for both the whale shark measure and the best practice safe release guidelines, noting mortalities to 75 whale sharks in two years, and the estimate that whale shark tourism generates $50 million annually.  They urged intersessional work toward adopting a measure at WCPFC9."
WCPFC8,367,"In considering the draft measure on protecting whale sharks from purse seine fishing operations, WCPFC8 noted ongoing work, through the Scientific Committee, on the development of best practice guidelines for release of encircled whale sharks.  Based on the current draft measure, the Commission agreed to finalise the measure at WCPFC9.        44 9.2.3 Implementation of the ROP for Fresh Fishing Vessels North of 20o N"
WCPFC8,368,The WCPFC Chair noted the recommendation from the Northern Committee to adopt a new CMM for implementation of the ROP for vessels fishing for fresh fish in Convention Area north of 20o North (see Agenda Item 7.1).
WCPFC8,369,"The USA referred to their proposal to consolidate proposed observer coverage levels based on CMM 2008-01 (WCPFC8-2011-DP/12) and explained that that their proposal presents a new version of the ROP CMM (currently CMM 2007-01) which contains the recommended text from the Northern Committee as Attachment K, Annex C."
WCPFC8,370,FFA members stated their support for implementation of the ROP for vessels fishing for fresh fish in the northern part of the Convention Area.  However these CCMs considered that the Northern Committee’s proposal appears to allow for vessels to carry observers from their own flag State and therefore is not consistent with the agreed ROP hybrid approach.  For this reason FFA members did not support the proposal.
WCPFC8,371,The USA reiterated their support for the Northern Committee proposal on the basis that the new text does not create any inconsistencies with existing requirements for observer sourcing.
WCPFC8,372,The WCPFC Chair referred the matter back to the Northern Committee for further discussion.   9.2.4 Implementation of an EEZ Entry and Exit Notification Scheme
WCPFC8,373,This item was discussed under Agenda Item 8.5.3.   9.2.5 Catch Documentation Scheme
WCPFC8,374,The Chair reminded WCPFC8 that the task before the Commission was to agree terms of reference for a working group on catch documentation schemes.  He referred WCPFC8 to papers on this subject prepared by the EU (WCPFC8-2011-DP/28 and WCPFC8-2011-DP/29) and FFA (WCPFC-2011-DP/04).
WCPFC8,375,"Papua New Guinea, Coordinator of the WCPFC CDS Working Group, presented draft terms of reference which incorporated comments from CCMs.  WCPFC8 was asked to endorse the TORs in order to allow the working group to hold a meeting and commence its work prior to TCC8."
WCPFC8,376,The EU noted that it had consulted with Papua New Guinea and others on the TOR but could not accept para. 3f which deals with the roles and responsibilities of different actors as currently drafted.  This is a question of consistency with the revision of Attachment A to the TOR.
WCPFC8,377,Some CCMs suggested that the EU concerns could be noted for the record but the CDS working group could still be formed and begin addressing this issue as well as all other issues relevant to development of a WCPFC CDS.
WCPFC8,378,The EU reiterated that it could not agree to the language in para. 3f.
WCPFC8,379,Papua New Guinea stated that it intended to maintain the text of its proposal as written. FFA members commented that they would go ahead and develop a regional CDS independently  45 of the Commission; that they welcomed the involvement of all members of the Commission in this process; and that they intend to hold a workshop in mid 2012 to progress a regionally agreed CDS.
WCPFC8,380,WCPFC8 agreed that the TOR for the CDS working group (WCPFC-2011-DP/20) be referred back to TCC8.   9.2.6 Oceanic Whitetip Shark
WCPFC8,381,"The USA presented its proposal for a CMM for oceanic whitetip sharks (WCPFC8-2011-DP/11 (Rev 2)).  Mr Keith Bigelow made a brief presentation highlighting the rationale for immediate action to protect this species including scientific findings of steep declining catch rates in multiple datasets from the WCPFC, the low probability that understanding of stock status will change with the results of stock assessments, and the fact that CMMs have been adopted for this species in two other RFMOs.  The USA explained that the proposed measure had been revised to incorporate comments from CCMs in the margins of WCPFC8 including a statement indicating that measure should not set a precedent for the management of other WCPO sharks, removal of the prohibition on selling, development of identification guides and training, allowance for biological sampling, and provisions for periodic review."
WCPFC8,382,"Several CCMs, including FFA members, stated their support for the proposal as an initial step toward developing a more comprehensive approach to shark management.  These CCMs considered that the existing scientific advice was a sufficient basis for action."
WCPFC8,383,"The EU expressed very strong support for this proposal, and noted that comments it had provided were incorporated. The EU reminded that the Convention text provides obligation for CCMs to take a precautionary approach."
WCPFC8,384,FFA members further noted the need to allow time and provide information to skippers and crew for implementation.
WCPFC8,385,Some CCMs also noted concerns that this measure could be seen as a precedent for the prohibition of retaining other species. These CCMs  preferred a more fundamental review of the shark CMM instead.
WCPFC8,386,"Shark Advocates International and Humane Society International stated that the proposal is consistent with the scientific advice and protections adopted by IATTC and ICCAT, and noted that a “no retention” policy could reduce oceanic whitetip mortality by up to 76%.  Their statement is appended as Attachment T."
WCPFC8,387,"Several CCMs, noting that similar measures have been adopted by IATTC and that their concerns had been addressed through revisions to the proposal by the USA, voiced their support for the proposal."
WCPFC8,388,"WCPFC8 adopted the CMM for oceanic whitetip sharks as presented in WCPFC8-2011-DP/11 (Rev 2).  (Attachment U, CMM 2011-04) 9.3 Review of CMMs 9.3.1 CMM 2009-03 Swordfish  46"
WCPFC8,389,The Chair reminded WCPFC8 that para. 11 of CMM 2009-03 requires the Commission to review the measure in 2011.  WCPFC8 was also invited to address the issue of conducting a stock assessment for swordfish.
WCPFC8,390,"CCMs noted that shortfalls in data provision by the EU which had impeded previous stock assessments have been remedied, and it is now possible to proceed with the stock assessment.  CCMs also noted that existing knowledge of the status of the stock is limited and this hampers review of the measure."
WCPFC8,391,The EU requested that the stock assessment proceed immediately with the results presented to SC8.
WCPFC8,392,"Several CCMs suggested that the time available before SC8 is insufficient to complete a thorough stock assessment with the new data, and this kind of rushed approach should not be undertaken."
WCPFC8,393,"In response to a question about whether it could deliver a swordfish stock assessment in time for SC8, the Scientific Services Provider (SPC) noted that undertaking such a stock assessment in addition to the four stock assessments currently underway will require identifying and contracting an additional stock assessment scientist for this work.  This process will take time and will reduce the already short period of time available to produce the assessment.  SPC nevertheless committed to commencing this work and presenting available, and perhaps interim, results to SC8 and to continuing the work post-SC8 as necessary.  The SPC further requested that sufficient budget be made available to undertake this additional work."
WCPFC8,394,WCPFC8 agreed that the Scientific Services Provider should begin work on the swordfish stock assessment and present available results to SC8.     9.3.2 CMM 2009-08 Charter Notification
WCPFC8,395,"The Chair invited WCPFC8 to consider the CMM on charter notification (CMM 2009-08) which is scheduled to expire in 2011.  He noted the close relationship between the charter notification measure and the issue of catch attribution which was examined in a recent Commission study (WCPFC8-2011/23).  The Secretariat’s summary of all notified charter vessels, as required by paras. 5 and 6 of CMM 2009-08 was provided as WCPFC8-2011/33 (Rev 1)."
WCPFC8,396,FFA members noted that they had prepared a paper containing a revised measure (WPCFC8-2011-DP/05) but had not been able to achieve consensus among all CCMs on the proposed text.  FFA members proposed deleting para. 8 of the existing measure (i.e. the expiry clause) and extending the remaining provisions of the existing measure for another year.
WCPFC8,397,"The USA, which also proposed a revised measure (WCPFC8-2011-DP/13), concurred with the FFA proposal."
WCPFC8,398,"The EU noted that it had worked with FFA to elaborate further their proposal and progress was achieved. Therefore a one year extension of the current measure seemed appropriate to allow finalisation of this work. The EU drew attention to the poor compliance to this measure, referring in particular to the annex to WCPFC8-2011/33 where the list of charter notification for 2011 did not correspond with information in Part 1 reports and with statements at WCPFC8. The EU considered that charter- related issues within WCPFC need to be reviewed jointly.   47"
WCPFC8,399,Other CCMs expressed support for the one-year extension and noted the importance of timely notification of chartering arrangements and resolving issues related to catch attribution.
WCPFC8,400,"WCPFC8 agreed to extend the CMM on charter notification (CMM 2009-08) to 31 December 2012.  (Attachment V, CMM 2011-05)"
WCPFC8,401,"Referring to the catch attribution study (WCPFC8-2011/23), the Executive Director suggested the study outputs be referred to TCC for further discussions on formulating recommendations for implementation."
WCPFC8,402,CCMs considered that the study results should be noted for future discussions by the Commission but not referred specifically to TCC for action.
WCPFC8,403,WCPFC8 noted the results of the catch attribution study.   9.3.3 CMM 2010-06 IUU (para 15 and 25)
WCPFC8,404,"Tonga presented a paper describing its efforts to ensure that coastal State satisfaction plays a major role in determining whether a vessel should or should not be placed on the IUU Vessel List (WCPFC8-2011-DP/21).  The paper presents guidelines used by the Cook Islands, New Zealand, Tokelau and Tonga when considering levels of sanctions applied in cases of IUU fishing."
WCPFC8,405,"Some CCMs, including the USA, stated that they hoped to continue dialogue on this issue intersessionally and at TCC8."
WCPFC8,406,One CCM questioned whether all of the criteria contained in the guidelines were adequately supported by international law.
WCPFC8,407,WCPFC8 agreed that the USA would lead an intersessional working group on this topic with the aim of bringing a proposal to TCC8.   9.3.4 CMM 2010-03 Compliance Monitoring Scheme
WCPFC8,408,Australia briefly introduced a review of CMM 2010-03 (WCPFC8-2011-DP/32) and proposed revisions to the text of the measure (WCPFC8-2011-DP/33 (Rev 1)).  It noted that discussion of its proposals for responses to non-compliance (WCPFC8-2011-DP/34) had been deferred to TCC8.
WCPFC8,409,"Several CCMs supported extension of the measure, as presented in WCPFC8-2011-DP/33 (Rev 1), for one year."
WCPFC8,410,One CCM requested that para. 11 (iii) be revised to read “identify technical assistance or capacity building needed to assist the CCM to address potential compliance issues”.
WCPFC8,411,"The Executive Director noted the workload associated with this CMM and asked CCMs to consider providing interns to the Commission during the processing period of developing draft CMRs, so that the Secretariat can ensure that the draft CMR reports are provided to CCMs within the required timeframes in the CMM.    48"
WCPFC8,412,"WCPFC8 adopted a revised CMM for the Compliance Monitoring Scheme based on WCPFC8-2011-DP/33 (Rev 1)) as modified by the amendment to para. 11 (iii) (Attachment W, CMM 2011-06).  9.3.5 CMM 2010-05 South Pacific Albacore"
WCPFC8,413,"FFA members expressed their disappointment that this item which is of importance to Pacific Island member countries was so late in the agenda, that it is now impossible to discuss and progress the issue."
WCPFC8,414,"FFA members presented a proposal to revise CMM 2010-05 to strengthen the limits on the number of vessels and include catch limits on the high seas (WCPFC8-2011-DP/03).  These CCMs highlighted the importance of the stock to domestic longline fisheries and their growing concern at the increasing catch and effort for this stock by some CCMs.  They recommended that the Commission take appropriate measures for high seas areas, and examine whether transhipment activities are in compliance with WCPFC CMMs."
WCPFC8,415,"Some CCMs suggested the proposed limits on vessels and catches required further discussion.  Particular issues raised included the link between the proposed limits and the status of the stock, the rationale for selection of the baseline periods, the appropriateness of placing limits on all gear types rather than only on the longline fishery, and the effectiveness of imposing limits only on the high seas."
WCPFC8,416,"In response to a question, FFA members clarified that the proposed catch limits for the high seas were designed to apply to South Pacific albacore throughout its range.  These CCMs noted that the measure already includes provisions to limit the fishery to historical levels but as it is considered that these provisions are not working effectively they should be tightened.  While work continues on comprehensive management for the whole stock and all gear types, the current proposal can be considered as an interim measure."
WCPFC8,417,"American Samoa, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna emphasized the importance of maintaining the stock at sustainable levels in order to sustain the economic benefits generated by their existing fisheries."
WCPFC8,418,"WWF, on behalf of Greenpeace and the Pew Environment Group, referred to their paper on this topic (WCPFC8-2011-OP/10), and stated that while the stock was not considered overfished nor was overfishing occurring, catches are rapidly approaching MSY and this creates concerns about impacts on sharks and seabirds.  These observers encouraged management efforts by Te Vaka Moana members and urged the Commission to support compatible measures.  This statement is appended as Attachment X."
WCPFC8,419,The Pacific Islands Tuna Industry Association (PITIA) supported the initiative by Te Vaka Moana members to strengthen management measures for the fishery and protect the interests of SIDS.
WCPFC8,420,The American Fishermen’s Research Foundation requested to be consulted in matters related to North and South Pacific albacore fisheries.     49
WCPFC8,421,Japan stated that it shares the concerns of previous speakers regarding the rapid increase of small longliners fishing in the area.  It noted that its trade statistics showed a large increase in imports of South Pacific albacore.
WCPFC8,422,Several CCMs appreciated the information on catch and transhipment by flag and by zone for South Pacific albacore provided by the Secretariat as WCPFC8-2011-IP/04 (Rev 1) and asked that this type of reporting be continued.
WCPFC8,423,WCPFC8 agreed that South Pacific albacore was a priority issue for WCPFC9. 9.3.6 Report by PNA members on the Vessel Day Scheme (VDS)
WCPFC8,424,"The PNA presented a report on the VDS (WCPFC8-2011-DP/23) showing that the total number of days fished was less than the adjusted total allowable effort of the scheme, excluding days fished under the FSM Arrangement and the US Treaty.  The PNA announced that although reports on the VDS have been provided to the Commission since 2007, this would be the last submission by the PNA as it considered it more appropriate for the scheme to be assessed through the WCPFC CMS."
WCPFC8,425,FFA members noted that the management of the fishery under the VDS is working well and seconded the PNA’s point that it was unfair to subject the VDS to greater scrutiny than other CCMs.
WCPFC8,426,The EU requested further information on the implementation of the VDS and how its limits are linked to scientific advice.  This could also be of interest to the SC. It could be useful for the WCPFC to receive such information as it may learn from the experience of the PNA in this regard.   AGENDA  ITEM  10  -  AD HOC TASK GROUP-DATA 10.1 Chartering State Data Access
WCPFC8,427,"The Commission had tasked the AHTG-Data to work intersessionally during 2011 on this matter. RMI submitted a proposal, and comments were received from EU and Chinese Taipei.TCC7 agreed to task the AHTG-Data with revisiting these issues in 2012 pending the outcome of discussions of the catch attribution study and the possible renewal of CMM 2009-08 by WCPFC8.  WCPFC8 noted the TCC7 recommendation.     AGENDA  ITEM  11  -  ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION 11.1 Cooperation with other Organizations"
WCPFC8,428,"The Executive Director presented a report on cooperation with other organizations (WCPFC8-2011/35) stating that the focus in the past year has been on issues related to IATTC including cross endorsement of observers and management of the overlap area.  Other cooperative activities have involved the SPC, the FFA, the PNA and visits to member countries."
WCPFC8,429, The Executive Director noted the outstanding item of the MOU with ISC and invited WCPFC8 to either refer the issue to the SC or to address it as part of follow-up activities pursuant to the Performance Review Panel recommendations.  WCPFC8 did not make any decision on the matter.  50  11.1.1 WCPFC/IATTC Overlap Area
WCPFC8,430,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC8-2011/41 (Rev 1) on options for resolution of issues arising from the overlap area between WCPFC and IATTC.  The paper presents the history of the overlapping jurisdictions and shows that only 0.175% of the entire catch from the WCPFC and IATTC Convention areas is taken in the overlap area.  The options for management of the overlap area presented in the paper include:    i. Single organization management of the area ii. Management by gear type iii. Box the area and manage as a special management area iv. Application of measures from both Commissions with vessels flagged to a party that is a member of both Commissions subject to the measures of only one Commission, of that member’s choice v. Work toward harmonization of measures from both Commissions"
WCPFC8,431,"Dr Compeán (IATTC) provided additional information on the IATTC management system including limits on, inter alia, catch, fishing effort and capacity, observer requirements, prohibitions on discards and transhipments, and specifications of the tuna tracking system.  Dr Compeán noted that the Antigua Convention clearly states that it governs the overlap area, and given that many of the requirements are already included in national legislation, it would be very difficult to alter this."
WCPFC8,432,"Several Pacific Island countries and territories whose EEZs are near the overlap area emphasized the need to resolve the issues arising from the application of two sets of management measures, noting that IUU fishing incursions can be created by transiting through the overlap corridor.  These CCMs stated that the special requirements of SIDS should be recognized when considering management of the overlap area."
WCPFC8,433,"Some CCMs raised questions regarding how resolution of the issues would take account of catch attribution (and how this would relate to any applicable catch limits and financial contributions), and when two standards were in effect whether the higher or lower standard would prevail."
WCPFC8,434,"Some CCMs preferred Option iv stating that it appeared to be the easiest to implement but noted that it should be for the flag State, rather than the vessel, to decide which RFMO’s management system was applicable."
WCPFC8,435,"Other CCMs, while posing some questions about the need for each RFMO to adopt a set of exemptions for the gear type it would not regulate, preferred Option ii."
WCPFC8,436,"Several CCMs, preferred to continue to apply both RFMOs’ management systems, resolving conflicts as they arise on a case-by-case basis while working gradually toward a joint management system that would eliminate discrepancies and redundancies (Option v)."
WCPFC8,437,Some CCM’s suggested that a further option “Status quo” be added and evaluated as part of the ED discussions.     51
WCPFC8,438,The WCPFC Legal Advisor stated that Option iv could be implemented through adopting identical management measures for the overlap area in WCPFC and IATTC and then having these measures serve as the basis for domestic legislation for each CCM.
WCPFC8,439,"It was agreed that the two Executive Directors would elaborate, and consult among CCMs in the margins of the meeting, on Options ii and iv."
WCPFC8,440,"WCPFC8 agreed that this issue of the overlap area needed to be resolved as a matter of priority and asked the Chairs and Executive Directors of the two RFMOs to progress the issue, and report back to CCMs. 11.2 Future Work of the Commission"
WCPFC8,441,"WCPFC8 noted the Report of the Executive Director on the work of the Commission during 2011 (WCFPC8-2011/34), and the future work planned by the Secretariat.   AGENDA  ITEM  12  -  REPORT OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE 12.1 Budget Approval for 2012 and Indicative Budgets for 2013 and 2014"
WCPFC8,442,"Mr Charleston Deiye, Chairman of the FAC, presented the summary report of FAC5 (WCPFC8-2011-50 Rev3)."
WCPFC8,443,"The USA noted that the funding which offsets the full costs to WCPFC for data entry through 2014 (WCPFC8-2011-FAC5/12, para. 20) is provided through a generous contribution from New Caledonia and New Zealand for year 2012.  Subject to the availability of funds the current level of contribution from New Caledonia will continue through 2014."
WCPFC8,444,"WCPFC8 accepted the summary report and recommendations of FAC5, WCPFC8-2011-50 Rev3).  (Attachment Y) 12.2 Requirements for the Hosting of Meetings"
WCPFC8,445,"The Secretariat’s recommendations concerning requirements for hosting of meetings (WCPFC8-2011- FAC5/11) was noted by FAC5 (WCPFC8-2011- 50, para. 19).   AGENDA  ITEM  13  -  ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS 13.1 Election of Officers"
WCPFC8,446,"WCPFC8 accepted the nominations of the subsidiary bodies and confirmed Ms Rhea Moss-Christian of FSM as Chair of the TCC and Ludwig Kumoru of Papua New Guinea as Vice Chair of the SC.  WCPFC8 expressed its appreciation for the work of Mr Noan Pakop of Papua New Guinea, outgoing Chair of the TCC, and Ms Pamela Maru of the Cook Islands, outgoing Vice Chair of the SC.   13.2 Venues for Next Meetings"
WCPFC8,447,"WCPFC8 confirmed the following venues and dates for meetings in 2012:   a. SC8 will be held 7-15 August 2012 in Korea (location to be determined);  52 b. NC8 will be held 3-6 September 2012 in Nagasaki, Japan; c. TCC8 will be held 27 September – 3 October 2012 in Pohnpei, FSM; and d. Management Objectives Workshop will be held 29-30 November 2012 in Manila, the Philippines. e. WCPFC9 will be held 3-7 December 2012 in Manila, the Philippines. AGENDA  ITEM  14  -  OTHER MATTERS"
WCPFC8,448,FFA presented a proposal for the rationalisation of WCPFC related meetings (WCPFC8-2011-DP/48) which seeks a way to reduce meeting time and promote efficiency within the Commission.
WCPFC8,449,"WCPFC8 agreed that the Secretariat, in conjunction with the Chair, develop a discussion paper on this topic, drawing on WCPFC8-2011-DP/48 as well as experiences in other tuna RFMOs, for consideration by WCPFC9."
WCPFC8,450,"The USA, Japan and the EU introduced a paper on the management of purse seine capacity in the Convention Area (WCPFC8-2011-DP/52).  These CCMs acknowledged that there is overcapacity in the purse seine fishery and that this capacity must be reduced to a level which is commensurate with the long-term sustainability of the resource.  The paper contained proposals to limit the capacity of non-SIDS to existing levels, limit new capacity by non-SIDS to replacement of vessels which have left the WCPO, and limit new vessels of non-SIDS to the same or lower capacity than the vessels being replaced.  While recognising that more work will be necessary to develop a regional capacity management plan, these CCMs noted with interest the proposal by RMI to limit purse seine capacity to 220 vessels by 2020."
WCPFC8,451,Korea expressed its support for the proposal.
WCPFC8,452,"FFA members noted with regret that the proposal appears to defer discussions to a future point in time rather than taking immediate action as recommended by WCPFC8-2011-DP/39 (see Agenda Item 9.1.1).  FFA members also expressed disappointment that the WCPFC8-2011-DP/52 drafting group did not include representation from the Marshall Islands delegation, which had previously introduced a paper on the subject (WCPFC8-2011-DP/39) and that the drafting group did not appear to include a mechanism for capacity transfer to SIDS. There were fears that the proposal in WCPFC8-2011-DP/52 might act to freeze the current pattern of participation in the fishery."
WCPFC8,453,"The CCMs presenting the paper stated that while this proposal represented the first step, they looked forward to moving ahead with discussions as soon as possible."
WCPFC8,454,The representative of the American Fishermen’s Research Foundation made a statement (Attachment Z). AGENDA  ITEM  15  -  SUMMARY REPORT
WCPFC8,455,"A summary report was prepared by the rapporteur and the Secretariat, and circulated to CCMs for comment.    53 AGENDA  ITEM  16  -  CLOSE OF MEETING"
WCPFC8,456,"The Chair thanked the Government of Guam for their warm hospitality and generous assistance with the logistical and social aspects of the meeting.  He also expressed his gratitude to Executive Director Prof Glenn Hurry, Legal Advisor Dr Martin Tsamenyi, and support staff including Lucille Martinez and Kara Miller.  Finally, he extended his appreciation to all of the delegations attending WCPFC8 for their patience and support.  On behalf of the members of the Commission, Samoa thanked the WCPFC Chair, the Executive Director and the Secretariat staff for their efforts."
WCPFC8,457,The Chair noted that the temporary measure extending CMM 2008-01 until 28 February 2013 (CMM 2011-01) would take effect at midnight.
WCPFC8,458,The Chair closed WCPFC8 at 19.20 on Friday 30 March 2012.
