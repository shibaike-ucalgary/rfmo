AGENDA ITEM  5 —  SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE REPORT  Report of the First Regular Session of the Scientific Committee"
WCPFC2,21,"Dr SungKwon Soh (Chair of the Scientific Committee, Korea) presented the summary outcomes of the First Regular Session held in Noumea from 8–19 August 2005. He highlighted that the Scientific Committee had addressed the requests for advice on conservation and management measures presented in the Resolution on Conservation and Management Measures adopted at the Inaugural Session of the Commission (as detailed in Annex II of the Summary Record of the Inaugural Session), including: • estimates of sustainable catch and effort levels for bigeye, yellowfin and South Pacific albacore;  • biomass projections for bigeye and yellowfin tuna relative to 2003 catch and effort levels, including the effects on stocks of time/area closures; •  investigation of measures to mitigate the catch of juvenile bigeye and yellowfin tuna, including controls on setting on floating objects; • estimates of the mortality of non-target species with an initial focus on seabirds, turtles and sharks; and  • data and other issues requiring consultation between the Scientific Committee and the Technical and Compliance Committee.    The Scientific Committee also discussed:  • the data requirements of the Commission, • the submission of data to, and data dissemination by, the Commission,  • collaboration with the Technical and Compliance Committee regarding data collected by the observer programme, • data management and data security, • the independent review of the transitional scientific structure and functions that would examine the effectiveness of the science structure of the Commission by June 2007, and  • the Indonesia and Philippine Data Collection Project (IPDCP).    4 Response to the Resolution on Conservation and Management Measures"
WCPFC2,22,"Dr Soh presented the Scientific Committee's response to requests for advice from the Inaugural Session of the Commission, as detailed in the Resolution on Conservation and Management Measures."
WCPFC2,23,"The Commission noted:  • Despite the 1999 PrepCon/MHLC Resolution on exercising reasonable restraint on capacity, the Report of the First Regular Session of the Scientific Committee indicated that effort and fishing capacity in the Convention Area continued to expand; • A reduction in the use of fish aggregating devices and floating objects appeared to be the most effective method of reducing bycatch of juvenile bigeye tuna; • Although the level of observer coverage required for collecting adequate data for estimating the mortality of non-target species varies among species and from fishery to fishery, rarer species require a higher level of coverage. Some experts suggested that 20% observer coverage was a reasonable target for purse seine operations and at least 10% for longline operations; • The level of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean was a significant factor in preventing accurate estimates of catch and effort levels for regional tuna fisheries, and for developing appropriate advice in respect of conservation and management measures; • The issue of uncertainty associated with the Scientific Committee's assessments and analyses related to species identification, particularly with respect to juvenile bigeye tuna and the lack of comprehensive information for fisheries in Indonesia and the Philippines.  This impacted on the degree of confidence that could be provided for long-term forecasts of the status of regional tuna stocks;  • There is potential for significant fishing impacts on the adult component of the South Pacific albacore stock, and catch rates, if fishing effort is increased. This is due to the way in which the stock is fished (larger, older fish are taken rather than juveniles), despite the high degree of resilience (in biological terms) in the stock overall;  • Fishing mortality for bigeye tuna is divided evenly across longline and other gear types, and between catches from the high seas and areas under national jurisdiction; • Current assessments presented in the Report of the Scientific Committee represent the best information available and, given the commitment to a precautionary approach, the Commission was urged to take the assessments into account in formulating future conservation and management measures.  Advice and recommendations of the Scientific Committee to the Commission"
WCPFC2,24,"Dr Soh presented the recommendations and advice of the Scientific Committee to the Commission. These recommendations related to scientific data to be provided to the Commission, the review of the Indonesia and Philippines Data Collection Project, standards for the provision of operational level catch and effort data to the Commission, the management and dissemination of this data, observer scientific data requirements, activities for support under the Special Requirements Fund, the relationship between the Scientific Committee and the Technical and Compliance Committee regarding the observer programme, the appointment of Specialist Working Group conveners and the terms of reference for an Independent Review scheduled for the first half of 2007."
WCPFC2,25,The Scientific Committee recommended that Dr Shelton Harley (New Zealand) be appointed as Vice Chair of the Scientific Committee.   5
WCPFC2,26,"The Commission adopted the Report of the First Regular Session of the Scientific Committee and its recommendations, subject to budgetary considerations.  Work programme for the Scientific Committee in 2006"
WCPFC2,27,"In accordance with Article 12 of the Convention, Dr Soh presented a draft work programme for 2006 for the Scientific Committee. This work programme was adopted by the Commission as part of the Scientific Committee Report, noting any additional requests made by the Commission during its discussions."
WCPFC2,28,"The Commission noted that, as the position of Chair of the Scientific Committee would fall vacant early in 2006, a new Chair would be appointed at its Second Regular Session. In the interim it was agreed that Dr Harley would work with the Secretariat to prepare for the Second Regular Session of the Committee."
WCPFC2,29,"Dr John Hampton (Secretariat of the Pacific Community) reported on plans for a regional tuna tagging programme that will be initiated in the waters under the jurisdiction of Papua New Guinea. He noted that, as the project could be extended to the broader Convention Area, the Commission may wish to establish a steering committee to oversee the project. The European Community, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand contributed significant financial support to the project to date.  AGENDA ITEM  6 —  ADOPTION OF CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES  Conservation and management measures"
WCPFC2,30,"Concern was expressed over the short time frames available for consideration of draft resolutions. The Commission agreed in good faith that, despite Rule 20 of the Rules of Procedure that requires 24 hours notice, Members would try to submit draft proposals 30 days prior to the Annual Session of the Commission in order to allow all Members adequate time for consideration and consultation."
WCPFC2,31,"The Chair confirmed that the USA and Indonesia, as original members of the Multilateral High-level Conference (MHLC) and Preparatory Conference processes, and as Cooperating Non-members, were eligible to submit draft proposals and participate in the debate within the Commission, but they could not participate in decision-making."
WCPFC2,32,The Commission made the decision to adopt the following: • Conservation and management measures for bigeye and yellowfin tuna in the western and central Pacific Ocean (Attachment D).   • Conservation and management measures for South Pacific albacore (Attachment E); • Conservation and management measures for North Pacific albacore (Attachment F); • Resolution on the reduction of overcapacity (Attachment H); • Resolution on the incidental catch of seabirds (Attachment G); • Resolution on non-target fish species (Attachment I); and • Resolution to mitigate the impact of fishing for highly migratory fish species on turtles (Attachment J).
WCPFC2,33,"In relation to the measures on North Pacific albacore and South Pacific albacore, it was agreed that the Commission would review these decisions at the Third Regular Session in 2006. The Commission instructed the Scientific Committee to give priority to developing a stock assessment for  6South Pacific albacore for consideration in this review. Pending the results of this review, and any additional advice provided by the Scientific Committee, Members, Cooperating Non-members and participating territories (CCMs) were urged to exercise restraint with respect to increased fishing for this stock in the Convention Area."
WCPFC2,34,"With the adoption of the Resolution on the reduction of overcapacity, Chinese Taipei made a commitment to cooperate with Japan and other concerned Members to implement the Resolution reiterating that the implementation of the Resolution would not prejudice the interests of its legitimate licensed purse seiners."
WCPFC2,35,"In relation to the Resolution on seabirds, the Commission agreed that the Scientific Committee should take the practical steps necessary for improving the recording and monitoring of seabird interactions, including species involved and rates of total mortality in the Convention Area. The Technical and Compliance Committee should monitor the progress of CCMs in applying this resolution and report to the Commission and develop relevant strategies for further consideration of the Commission."
WCPFC2,36,"The Commission agreed that the Scientific Committee, in consultation with the Technical and Compliance Committee, should investigate seabird mitigation measures applied and tested by other regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), particularly those of the Commission for Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources; investigate the utility of implementing compatible measures; and recommend specific seabird mitigation measures for consideration at the Third Regular Session of the Commission."
WCPFC2,37,"In relation to the Resolution relating to sea turtles, it was agreed that the Commission, through the Scientific Committee and the Technical and Compliance Committee, should develop a programme that includes researching and developing gear and bait alternatives; promoting the use of available bycatch mitigation technology; promoting and strengthening data collection programmes to obtain standardized information for developing reliable estimates of sea turtle bycatch; biological research on sea turtles, including the identification of migration routes or other areas of spatial or temporal importance; industry education, development and promotion of safe handling techniques and other techniques to improve sea turtle conservation. This programme will take into account the sea turtle conservation efforts undertaken in other international organizations, in particular the IATTC."
WCPFC2,38,"The Commission requested that the Secretariat, in cooperation with the Scientific Committee, centralize bycatch and observer data to obtain better estimates of total catch and mortalities of sea turtles by fisheries that target highly migratory fish species covered by the Convention within the Convention Area.  The Scientific Committee is requested to take practical steps necessary to improve monitoring and reporting of sea turtle interactions in the Convention Area, including the development of data standards and, specifications and reporting requirements."
WCPFC2,39,"The Commission agreed to task the Executive Director with producing a discussion paper on allocation issues within WCPFC for circulation to Commission Members in advance of the Third Regular Session of the Commission. While leaving it to the Executive Director to develop the necessary Terms of Reference for the development of the paper, the Commission considered it would be useful for this paper to include the following elements: • Overview of relevant provisions on international law relating to allocation of access to fisheries resources, including the rights and obligations of coastal states, flag states, fishing states and the role of RFMOs; • Overview and assessment of the experience of other RFMOs, particularly tuna RFMOs, in addressing allocation;  7• Analysis and discussion of the factors listed in Article 10(3) of the Convention relating to allocation criteria; • Discussion of potential models for allocation within WCPFC; and  • Outline of potential processes for the Commission to make progress on allocation."
WCPFC2,40,"The Commission agreed to defer discussion of the issue of regulating transshipment until the Second Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee (TCC), at which time a more comprehensive strategy will be developed incorporating longline and other vessels. It was agreed that a draft proposal prepared by Australia and the Philippines would be used as the basis for further consideration of transshipment (Attachment K)."
WCPFC2,41,"The Commission noted that a large proportion of purse seine landings are conducted in non-member countries, in particular Thailand, and the Commission agreed that the Executive Director shall write to the relevant authorities seeking cooperation from such non-members."
WCPFC2,42,"In accordance with Article 29(5) of the Convention, the Commission agreed to exempt the Philippines from the prohibition on transshipping at sea by purse seine vessels for a period of 12 months, until procedures for transshipment are agreed on at the Third Regular Session of the Commission."
WCPFC2,43,"Also in accordance with Article 29(5), the Commission agreed to grant exemptions to all FFA countries currently engaging in purse seine transshipment at sea in waters under national jurisdiction for a period of 12 months, until procedures for transshipment are agreed on at the Third Regular Session of the Commission."
WCPFC2,44,"Noting the concerns expressed by a number of Members relating to the proposal only requiring the documentation of traded products rather than all catch, the Commission agreed to defer consideration of a proposal for the adoption and implementation of a statistical documentation scheme as set out in (WCPFC/Comm2/DP03 Rev.1) for bigeye tuna. The Commission agreed that concerned members should work intersessionally with Japan to develop a more comprehensive scheme covering all catch for consideration at the Third Regular Session of the Commission."
WCPFC2,45,The Commission agreed to defer consideration of the shark conservation resolution as set out in WCPFC/Comm.2/DP21.Rev1 until the Third Regular Session of the Commission.
WCPFC2,46,"The Commission agreed to defer consideration of swordfish management measures for the southwest Pacific until the Third Regular Session of the Commission in 2006, and requested that the Scientific Committee provide additional advice on the status of the southwest Pacific swordfish stock at this meeting to enable the Commission to take a decision. The Commission urged all Members to exercise reasonable restraint in expanding fishing effort on the southwest Pacific swordfish stock, particularly with respect to establishing a catch history in anticipation of the adoption of conservation and management measures. The Commission asked interested Members to meet informally and discuss the issue in February in New Zealand.  AGENDA ITEM 7 —  NORTHERN COMMITTEE  Report of the First Regular Session of the Northern Committee"
WCPFC2,47,"Mr Masanori Miyahara (Chair of the Northern Committee, Japan) presented the summary outcomes of the First Regular Session of the Northern Committee, which met on 12 December 2005 in  8Pohnpei. The meeting had considered Secretariat functions, management measures for North Pacific albacore and the Committee’s relationship with other organizations."
WCPFC2,48,"  It was clarified that the International Scientific Committee (ISC) will liaise with the Scientific Committee in relation to scientific advice for northern stocks. The Commission adopted the Report of the First Regular Session of the Northern Committee, including a revised Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the ISC and the Commission. It was noted that the independent review of scientific services to the Commission in early 2007 would examine options for securing scientific advice for all tuna stocks of interest to the Commission.  Advice and recommendation of the Northern Committee to the Commission"
WCPFC2,49,Mr Miyahara presented a recommendation from the Northern Committee on conservation and management measures for North Pacific albacore stocks. This was subsequently adopted by the Commission (see paragraph 32 and 33 above).
WCPFC2,50,The Northern Committee will hold its next meeting in Japan from 11–13 September 2006.    AGENDA ITEM 8 — TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE ISSUES  Report of the First Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee
WCPFC2,51,"Mr Apolosi Turaganivalu (Chair of the Technical and Compliance Committee, Fiji) presented the summary outcomes of the First Regular Session of the Technical and Compliance Committee meeting held in Pohnpei from 5–9 December 2005. He highlighted the Technical and Compliance Committee’s (TCC) consideration of annual reporting requirements by Members to the Commission, the development of a template for the preparation of Annual Reports, discussions relating to the Record of Fishing Vessels and Authorizations to Fish and confirmation of the monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) priorities for the Commission. These were identified as the Commission’s vessel monitoring system (VMS), the regional observer programme, high seas boarding and inspection, port State measures and transshipment.  The TCC also considered technical matters associated with the implementation of conservation and management measures that might be considered by the Commission, as had been requested at the Inaugural Session of the Commission."
WCPFC2,52,"The TCC requested that the Secretariat undertake further work during 2006 in respect of the Commission’s VMS, including a cost assessment and feasibility study of two options identified as offering the best potential to meet the Commission’s needs. In relation to the regional observer programme, the TCC recommended bringing forward the recruitment of the Observer Programme Coordinator to mid-2006.    Response to the Resolution on Conservation and Management Measures"
WCPFC2,53,"Mr Turaganivalu outlined the response of the TCC to the request from the Inaugural Session of the Commission for advice on technical issues associated with the implementation of conservation and management measures that might be adopted by the Commission (Attachment H to the Summary Record of the First Regular Session of the TCC). The TCC noted that while the Commission had not yet adopted conservation and management measures, a functional VMS and operational observer programme were two key MCS components that would be required to support any conservation and management measures adopted by the Commission.     9Advice and recommendations of the Technical and Compliance Committee to the Commission"
WCPFC2,54,Mr Turaganivalu presented the recommendations of the TCC to the Commission. The Commission adopted the recommendations that had been agreed by consensus by the TCC.
WCPFC2,55,"  The Commission noted that although the differentiation of fishery management between EEZs and high seas in the Pacific Islands region was controversial in the past, consistent management and VMS monitoring through EEZs and high seas areas are desirable. The Commission considered the possibility that the FFA Secretariat could provide the interim service of the VMS system covering both EEZ and high seas in the Pacific Islands region until a decision is made regarding the structure and operation of the Commission’s high seas VMS."
WCPFC2,56,"  The Commission noted that the fishing activity in the North Pacific was significantly different from that in the South Pacific in that there is extensive activity operating in the disputed zones between Japan, Korea and China. As a result, it was noted that this situation would impact the application of the same VMS in the North and South Pacific and was an issue that needed to be considered in the development of the Commission’s VMS."
WCPFC2,57,"In relation to the regional observer programme, the Commission agreed to proceed with the hybrid option recommended by PrepCon Working Group 1 and identified in WCPFC/TCC1/14, also taking into account transshipment observer programmes of other tuna RFMOs, and requested the Scientific Committee and the Technical and Compliance Committee to begin developing a work programme for its implementation."
WCPFC2,58,"The Commission agreed that early consideration would be given to improving observer coverage in the Convention Area, particularly in relation to longline fishing and fishing on the high seas, noting that inter alia, observer safety, vessel size and costs are important considerations in improving observer coverage."
WCPFC2,59,"In relation to high seas boarding and inspection, the Commission took note of the provisions of Article 26 of the WCPF Convention, which require that if boarding and inspection procedures are not developed within two years of entry into force of the Convention (which will be on 19 June 2006), then Articles 21 and 22 of the Agreement apply. The Commission recognized that, although significant progress was made in PrepCon Working Group III in developing procedures for high seas boarding and inspection, there was not sufficient time to reach agreement on these procedures in advance of the Second Regular Session of the Commission. As a result, per Article 26(2), Articles 21 and 22 of the Agreement will apply as of 19 June 2006, until the adoption of a specific boarding and inspection scheme when and if the Commission agrees to such a scheme."
WCPFC2,60,"However, noting that the practical application of Articles 21 and 22 of the Agreement would require the elaboration of additional measures and procedures, such as the development of appropriate domestic legislation, authorization of high seas boarding and inspections, notification of the form of identification issued to authorized inspectors, designation and publicity of the appropriate domestic authority to issue such notifications, and the development by the Commission of a process for receiving and publishing duly authorized inspectors and documenting the credentials of such inspectors and other information that has been submitted to the Commission, the Commission decided that the boarding and inspection procedures in Article 21 and 22 of the Agreement should not be utilized until these matters have been discussed intersessionally, and resolved at the Third Regular Session of the Commission."
WCPFC2,61,The Commission approved a recommendation from the TCC to establish an intersessional working group in accordance with the terms of reference found in Attachment G of the Report of the First Regular  10Session of the TCC to be convened by Mr William Gibbons-Fly (United States of America). It was agreed that this working group would meet as part of TCC2 in 2006.   Work programme for the Technical and Compliance Committee in 2006
WCPFC2,62,"In accordance with Article 14 of the Convention, the Chair of the Technical and Compliance Committee presented a draft work programme for 2006 for the Technical and Compliance Committee for consideration in the formulation of the Commission’s 2006 Work Programme and Budget.   AGENDA ITEM 9 — EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT  Annual Report of the Executive Director"
WCPFC2,63,"In accordance with Rule of Procedure 13, the Executive Director delivered his Annual Report for 2005.  AGENDA ITEM 10 — ADMINSTRATION ITEMS  Issues arising from WCPFC1"
WCPFC2,64,"The Commission noted that the issues outlined in the Annex to WCPFC/Comm.2/11 had either been addressed intersessionally or would be addressed during WCPFC2. New Zealand drew the Commission’s attention to WCPFC/PrepCon5/34 paragraph 39, which provides that it is the responsibility of the Contracting Parties concerned, rather than the Commission, to develop guidelines relating to voluntary contributions for participating territories.  Report on accounts for 2005"
WCPFC2,65,The Executive Director provided a report on the Commission accounts for 2005 as outlined in WCPFC/Comm.2/13. He noted that assessed contributions received by the Secretariat as of 30 November amounted to 47% of projected 2005 income from Members. He appealed to Members to make their 2005 payments before the end of the year. He advised that an audit will be undertaken in February 2006 and the result would be circulated to Members by 31 March 2006. There was suggestion that pending contributions from Members should be shown on the balance sheet as receivables.  Auditor’s report for 2004
WCPFC2,66,"Noting the Commission had not managed any funds in 2004, the Commission adopted the auditor’s report of the Preparatory Conference Organisational Fund (PCOF) that had been circulated to all Members by the Forum Fisheries Agency, as administrator of the PCOF, in February 2005.   Report on the collection of contributions and advances to Working Capital Fund"
WCPFC2,67,The Commission noted there was no report on the Working Capital Fund (WCF) as no advances had been credited to the account during 2004 or 2005.  Report on the status of the Special Requirements Fund
WCPFC2,68,"The Executive Director reported that, following contributions from the Federated States of Micronesia and the United States of America, the balance for the Special Requirements Fund, as of 30 November 2005, was US $35,000.   11"
WCPFC2,69,FFA members encouraged all CCMs to contribute to the Special Requirements Fund.  Appointment of external auditor
WCPFC2,70,The Commission agreed to appoint Deloitte Touche as the Commission’s auditor for a period of two years.   Financial regulations
WCPFC2,71,"The Commission noted that the correct version of the Financial Regulations, as agreed to at the Final Preparatory Conference, had now been circulated.    Staff establishment"
WCPFC2,72,"The Commission considered a paper prepared by the Secretariat relating to staff establishment and services. The Commission noted that it is the responsibility of the Executive Director to manage Secretariat functions cost-effectively and to report with full transparency to the Commission, rather than requiring administrative decisions from the Commission. Furthermore, it was noted that regional balance should be taken into account when hiring staff."
WCPFC2,73,"The Commission considered the structure as proposed, and agreed to defer a decision on the establishment of a permanent legal post within the Secretariat until the Third Regular Session of the Commission. The Commission also encouraged the Executive Director to outsource secretariat services as much as possible.   Staff regulations"
WCPFC2,74,"The Commission adopted the draft Staff Regulations prepared by the Secretariat, as amended."
WCPFC2,75,"The representative from FFA suggested that, as there are triennial reviews of the Council of Regional Organisations of the Pacific (CROP) employment conditions, the Commission’s Staff Regulations should be reviewed following the completion of these reviews to ensure the provisions remain as harmonized as possible.  Accommodation options for Commission staff"
WCPFC2,76,"The Commission recommended that the Executive Director continue to explore options for providing for the accommodation needs of the Secretariat’s staff. It was agreed that the Executive Director would write to Members in late February 2006, informing them of the outcomes of approaching local landowners to construct accommodation for Commission staff. If no progress had been made, the Executive Director would invite Members to make voluntary contributions to a Housing Fund that could be used to erect accommodation on vacant land that he would secure under long-term lease arrangements.   2006 Work Programme and Budget"
WCPFC2,77,The Commission adopted the 2006 budget and work programme appended as Attachment L.
WCPFC2,78,"The Commission agreed to carry forward un-expended funds from 2005 for use in the budget in 2006. Because this would mean that the Commission would function throughout 2006 without a Working  12Capital Fund (WCF), it was agreed that the indicative budget for 2007 should provide for a levy of 10% of assessed contributions that would be dedicated to the re-establishment of the WCF."
WCPFC2,79,"The Commission also noted that 2005 assessed contributions would not meet budget because Canada, Palau and Vanuatu were eligible for reduced payments as a result of their ratification of the Convention late in 2005 and the fact that Indonesia and the United Kingdom were unlikely to make contributions as they were not Members during 2005."
WCPFC2,80,The Commission noted that the budget would need to incorporate Pohnpei State sales tax as the National Government of the Federated States of Micronesia had not been in a position to waive this requirement as part of the Headquarters Agreement. It was noted that the National Government was seeking a review of this with the Pohnpei State Government.   AGENDA ITEM 11 — COOPERATING NON-MEMBERS  Applications for Cooperating Non-members
WCPFC2,81,"The Commission agreed to defer a decision on the Cooperating Non-member status of Belize until the Third Regular Session of the Commission. The Commission requested that the Executive Director write to the Government of Belize advising them of the Commission’s decision and of the issues that Belize would need to address to obtain membership. These issues included the need to demonstrate a history of compliance with international agreements and resolutions, a clear indication of Belize’s motivation to join the Commission, and the need to demonstrate an ability to control vessels under its flag."
WCPFC2,82,"In accordance with the recommendation in paragraph 21 of the Summary Record of the Inaugural Session of the Commission, and the procedures on Cooperating Non-members adopted at the Inaugural Session, the Cooperating Non-member status of the United States of America was extended for another year, or until it becomes a Member of the Commission, whichever occurs first."
WCPFC2,83,"The Chair noted that a request for extension of Cooperating Non-member status was not received from Indonesia. The Commission agreed that the Executive Director would write to Indonesia, and if requested by Indonesia, circulate its request for an extension of its Cooperating Non-member status out of Session.  AGENDA ITEM 12 — SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES  Guidelines for assisting developing States"
WCPFC2,84,"The Commission was informed that FFA members would prepare a strategy to guide the capacity building work of the Commission for developing States and participating territories that would be supported by the Special Requirements Fund. The finalization of the draft Guidelines prepared by the Secretariat, annexed to WCPFC/Comm2/26, would wait for the adoption of that strategy."
WCPFC2,85,"Japan reported that over the period 2006–2010, it would contribute US$ 2 million, in the form of the Japanese Trust Fund, to support capacity building in the areas of fisheries statistics, regulation and enforcement. The establishment of the Japanese Trust Fund was gratefully acknowledged by the Commission.    13AGENDA ITEM 13 — COOPERATION WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS  Cooperation, consultation and collaboration with the Commission of the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), FAO, Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), International Scientific Committee (ISC), Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC)"
WCPFC2,86,The Executive Director described progress to date in establishing relationships with other organizations as set out in WCPFC/Comm.2/19 Rev. 1.      AGENDA ITEM 14 — OTHER MATTERS  2006 UN Fish Stocks Agreement Review Conference participation
WCPFC2,87,"The Commission agreed that, given the WCPFC is the first Commission established after the entry into force of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, the Secretariat and the Chair should attend the Conference. Members were encouraged to provide information and advice to the Secretariat to assist with WCPFC preparations for the Conference.  2007 Joint Tuna RFMO Meeting"
WCPFC2,88,"The Commission noted that the FAO Committee on Fisheries agreed to a joint meeting of tuna RFMOs in Japan, 22–26 January 2007.
