WCPFC6,14,"The agenda, as amended by the meeting (WCPFC6-2009/02 (Rev. 1), and the associated programme of work (WCPFC-2009/04), were adopted (Attachment N).   1.3 Meeting arrangements"
WCPFC6,15,"The WCPFC Executive Director, Andrew Wright, introduced Secretariat technical staff attending the meeting, including Lucille Martinez, Executive Assistant; Herolyn Movick, Office Manager; Andrew Richards, Compliance Manager; Ken Smithson, Finance and Administrative Manager; Dr SungKwon Soh, Science Manager; and Karl Staisch, Observer Programme Coordinator. In addition to Secretariat staff, Dr Shelley Clarke served as rapporteur, Dr Martin Tsamenyi as WCPFC Legal Advisor, and Dr Ziro Suzuki represented the Japanese Trust Fund, which is administered by the Secretariat.   3   AGENDA  ITEM  2  -  MEMBERSHIP 2.1 Status of the Convention"
WCPFC6,16,"New Zealand, as the depository of the Convention, reported that no instrument of ratification, or accession to, the Convention had been received since WCFPC5 (WCPFC6-2009/07)."
WCPFC6,17,"  The EU advised that as a result of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in early December 2009, its delegation would henceforth be referred to as ―European Union‖ and not ―European Community‖ as previously advised. The EU will notify this change shortly to the WCPFC Secretariat by means of an official correspondence."
WCPFC6,18,  Samoa requested correction of the misprint in the annex to WCPFC6-2009/07 regarding its signature and ratification dates.
WCPFC6,19,New Zealand agreed to look into these issues and report back to the Commission.   2.2 Applications for observer status
WCPFC6,20,"The Executive Director advised that one new request for observer status was received (from the Pew Charitable Trust; WCPFC6-2009/08 [Rev. 1]) in accordance with the Rules of Procedure (Rule 36), and an additional late request was received from The World Bank. While there was no objection to either group being granted observer status, the Executive Director noted that several Members, participating Territories, and Cooperating Non-members (CCMs) had stated that, in future, applicants for observer status should comply with all Commission rules and procedures."
WCPFC6,21,"New Zealand, on behalf of FFA members, reiterated the above issue and suggested that the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC) consider whether there are any costs to the Commission associated with the participation of observers. The FAC was invited to advise the Commission on the appropriateness and, if necessary, the level of observer registration fees in recognition of the growing number of observers and the costs incurred in catering for them at Commission meetings.   2.3 Applications for cooperating non-member status"
WCPFC6,22,"Applications for cooperating non-member (CNM) status, including applications for renewal of status by Indonesia, Belize, El Salvador, Mexico and Senegal, and new applications for CNM status from Ecuador and Vietnam, were considered by the Fifth Technical Compliance Committee meeting (TCC5) in accordance with procedures specified in CMM 2008-02. The Chair of the TCC, Ambassador Wendell Sanford (Canada), noted that none of the applicants had initially provided all of the required information, and that missing information had been requested via correspondence from the Executive Director (WPCFC-2009/09 [Rev. 1]). The TCC Chair noted that future applicants should be sure to check their submissions against the requirements of CMM 2008-02, thereby expediting TCC‘s work in processing applications."
WCPFC6,23,"WCPFC6 noted that in the past, participatory rights were granted based, in part, on voluntary undertakings by CNMs in relation to conservation and management measures (CMMs) and other Commission decisions that were adopted by the Commission at the time CNM status 4  was conferred. The Secretariat prepared a paper (WCPFC6-2009/09 Suppl.) on previous Commission decisions regarding CNMs‘ participatory rights."
WCPFC6,24,"In accordance with the requirement of CMM 2008-02 for the Commission to determine participatory rights for CNMs once CNM status is approved, New Zealand convened a small working group and submitted WCPFC6-2009/28, proposing specific participatory rights for each CNM in 2010."
WCPFC6,25,Several members stressed that CNM status should not be seen as a stepping stone to full membership.
WCPFC6,26,"Papua New Guinea and the Philippines stated that the wording of WCPFC6-2009/28 should not be taken as a precedent for the Commission‘s right to limit fishing activities in archipelagic waters, or to grant national allocations of fishing effort or national limits on catch.  These CCMs also noted with concern that text relating to limits on the number of fishing days, in combination with closing high seas areas (e.g. the two high seas pockets to purse-seine vessels under CMM 2008-01), could lead to an undesirable redistribution of purse-seine fishing effort to the central and eastern areas of the Convention Area.    Belize"
WCPFC6,27,"WCPFC6 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Belize with the following participatory rights:   Catches of bigeye tuna from Belize are limited to 803.25 mt, its average catch levels over the period of 2001–2004; catches of yellowfin tuna are limited to 2,000 mt; and its fishing activities are limited to: a. Under CMM 2005-02 in accordance with paragraph 1, Belize is limited to historical catch level for 2004 of two unique longliners in the Convention Area south of 20 degrees south latitude; b. Under CMM 2005-03 Belize is limited to the 2005 level of five unique longliners in the Convention Area north of the equator; and  c. Under CMM 2006-04, Belize is limited to two unique longliners in the Convention Area south of 15 degrees south latitude.  El Salvador"
WCPFC6,28,"WCPFC6 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by El Salvador with the following participatory rights:  El Salvador‘s fishing activities are limited to four unique purse-seine vessels in the Convention Area fishing in the EEZs of WCPFC Members subject to those vessels being placed on the WCPFC Record of Fishing Vessels (WCPFC RFV) and such opportunities becoming available. WCPFC6 agreed that in addition, under CMM 2008-01, El Salvador‘s fishing on the high seas in the Convention Area is limited to 29 days of fishing.       5  Indonesia"
WCPFC6,29,"WCPFC6 noted both the long history of Indonesia‘s involvement in the work of the WCPF Convention and the urgent need for further engagement of Indonesia in the work of the Commission, including, in particular, data provision and control of Indonesian-flagged vessels."
WCPFC6,30,"WCPFC6 approved Indonesia’s application for renewal of its CNM status with the following participatory rights:   a. WCPFC agreed that Indonesia‘s fishing activities in the Convention Area would be limited to, in accordance with CMM 2008-01, a longline big eye catch limit of 8,413 mt (less 20% or 6,730.4 mt) and purse-seine fishing on the high seas in the Convention Area is limited to 500 days. b. WCPFC6 encouraged Indonesia to apply compatible measures within its archipelagic waters given that the significance of these waters for juvenile yellowfin and bigeye catches. WCPFC6 noted that Indonesia is a recipient of the new Global Environment Facility West Pacific East Asia Oceanic Fisheries Management (WPEA OFM) Project, through the Commission, and encouraged Indonesia to work with the Commission particularly in areas of data collection improvement."
WCPFC6,31,"Indonesia expressed its appreciation to the Commission for the decision to renew its CNM status, reiterating its support for the principles of the Convention and noting benefits, such as capacity building, which accrue to Indonesia through its participation in the WCPFC. Indonesia stated that, consistent with its position throughout the Multilateral High Level Conference (MHLC) and Preparatory Conference, it considers that WCPFC CMMs do not apply to archipelagic waters.    Mexico"
WCPFC6,32,"With regard to the application for renewal of CNM status by Mexico, Japan expressed concern that Mexico did not attend the Fifth Regular Session of the Northern Committee (NC5), particularly given that Mexico catches at least 5,000 t per annum of Pacific bluefin tuna. Japan wished to make it clear that future renewals of Mexico‘s CNM status could be hampered by a continuing lack of participation in the work of the NC. Japan pointed out that Mexico's participation in the work of the NC should be considered at future renewals of the CNM status."
WCPFC6,33,"WCPFC6 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Mexico with the following participatory rights:    Mexico‘s fishing activities in the Convention Area are limited to not more than six unique purse-seine vessels fishing only in the EEZs of WCPFC Members, in accordance with appropriate bilateral agreements. WCPFC6 encouraged Mexico to participate in the work of the NC and cooperate fully with WCPFC Members in the conservation and management of Pacific bluefin tuna.  Senegal"
WCPFC6,34,"One CCM raised a continuing concern regarding species composition issues, including queries about skipjack catch and unusual ratios of swordfish and sharks, in the catch data provided by Senegal as part of its renewal application. The CCM expressed an interest in having these issues satisfactorily resolved by Senegal in the future.   6"
WCPFC6,35,"WCPFC6 approved the application for renewal of CNM status by Senegal with the following participatory rights:    Senegal‘s fishing activities in the Convention Area are limited to one unique longline vessel (the Robaliera), which was fishing in the Convention Area in 2005. Noting the concern regarding the species composition of the catches reported by Senegal in WCPFC6-2009/09 (Rev. 1), WCPFC6 tasked the Secretariat to examine the very high catches of skipjack reported by the Robaliera in 2006, and inconsistent ratios of reported swordfish to shark catches. In addition, and, in in light of any new information received, the Secretariat will calculate the swordfish catch limits that would apply to Senegal pursuant to the swordfish measure (CMM 2009-03) and will be circulated to all CCMs.  Ecuador"
WCPFC6,36,"With regard to the CNM application by Ecuador, the USA indicated that it was prepared to accept it, but noted that Ecuador has been implicated in a number of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing incidents in recent years. Ecuador‘s record in this regard will be carefully monitored and scrutinized again at WCPFC7."
WCPFC6,37,"Kiribati noted that in agreeing to the participatory right granted to Ecuador, it did not recognize the limits placed on Ecuador as any basis for limiting the number of licenses Kiribati issues for fishing in its EEZ."
WCPFC6,38,"WCPFC6 approved the application for CNM status by Ecuador with the following participatory rights:   At the time of making the decision, WCPFC6 had not received sufficient data to be able to confirm an applicable purse-seine days limit for Ecuador for the high seas for 2010.  Consequently, Ecuador will be limited to zero days during 2010. WCPFC6 noted that as soon as Ecuador provides to the Commission all relevant catch and effort data that would enable the WCPFC Secretariat to calculate and verify an applicable vessel-days limit pursuant to CMM 2008-01 for yellowfin and bigeye tunas, this limit will be appropriately adjusted and circulated to all CCMs. WCPFC6 agreed to the following conditions for acceptance of Ecuador‘s CNM status: a. Participatory rights are limited to no more than ten unique vessels that shall operate exclusively in waters under the jurisdiction of the coastal States from which they receive licenses. b. All vessels will be equipped with Commission and FFA vessel monitoring system (VMS), which shall be operational at all times while the vessels are in the Convention Area.  c. The Government of Ecuador provides assurances that it will comply with all requests from Commission Members for information and documentation to investigate cases of possible illegal fishing."
WCPFC6,39,Ecuador thanked the Commission for its favorable consideration of its application.    7  Vietnam
WCPFC6,40,"Vietnam made a statement reaffirming the commitments to the Commission made in its written statements, including its acquiescence to data provision, high seas boarding and inspection (HSBI), and participation in the Commission‘s WPEA OFM Project. Vietnam also stated its desire, as a coastal developing State, to receive an allocation of fishing opportunities."
WCPFC6,41,"In response to a question, the Executive Director noted that Vietnam catches between 30,000 mt and 40,000 mt of yellowfin and bigeye tuna per year in its coastal waters but reports no catch on the high seas of the Convention Area."
WCPFC6,42,"The EU explained that a shipment of swordfish from Vietnam was barred from import to the EU on the grounds that Vietnam was not a member of the WCPFC. Once Vietnam articulated to the EU a commitment to join the WCPFC, the shipment was cleared for import. The EU stated its view that Vietnam‘s fishery has an important effect on WCPFC-managed stocks, and thus it considers that Vietnam is an important collaborator."
WCPFC6,43,"Concerns were expressed by several CCMs regarding Vietnam‘s stated aspirations to obtain an allocation for fishing rights within the WCPF Convention Area. One CCM stated that because Vietnam‘s coastal waters in the South China Sea do not fall within the boundary of the WCPF Convention Area, its catch there does not qualify as historic catch in the WCPF Convention Area."
WCPFC6,44,"WCPFC6 approved the application for CNM status by Vietnam with the following participatory rights:    Noting the need for cooperation between Vietnam and the Commission to achieve compatibility of fisheries management and conservation, WCPFC6 agreed to grant CNM status to Vietnam for 2010 on the understanding that CNM status would only relate to the acquisition and exchange of fishery information and data and that Vietnam would require assistance in that regard."
WCPFC6,45,It was clarified that Vietnam would not be allowed to place vessels on the WCPFC‘s Record of Fishing Vessels.
WCPFC6,46,"Vietnam thanked the Commission for its favorable consideration of its application, reiterating that Vietnam will not have any fishing operations in the WCPFC Convention Area during 2010 (Attachment O)."
WCPFC6,47,"Many Members considered that CNMs who do not make a monetary contribution to the work of the Commission, but who gain financially from the fisheries of the Convention Area, are in effect ―free riders‖. Several Members considered that CNMs should contribute in proportion to the benefits they receive, with some of these suggesting that CNMs contribute in equal proportion to Members of the Commission. Many of these Members noted with concern the expanding budget for Commission work, and the increasing burden this is placing on small island developing States (SIDS), as creating even more urgency for equitable cost sharing."
WCPFC6,48,"Other CCMs supported the current situation of encouraging CNMs to make voluntary contributions, citing in particular the fact that CNMs do not have full participatory rights. These CCMs expressed concerns about setting a precedent in other regional fisheries management organizations.   8"
WCPFC6,49,"After further discussion, WCPFC6 adopted an amendment to CMM 2008-02 regarding financial contributions from CNMs (WCPFC6-2009/25, Attachment P). As a consequence, CMM 2008-02 is replaced by CMM 2009-11.   AGENDA  ITEM  3  -  MEMBER REPORTS 3.1 Annual Reports by the CCMs"
WCPFC6,50,"The WCPFC Compliance Manager, Andrew Richards, presented WCPFC6-2009/IP03 and WCPFC6-2009/IP06 (Rev. 1) on CCMs‘ compliance with Part 1 and Part 2 reporting. The first paper notes the number of Part 1 and Part 2 reports that have been received by the Secretariat, and the number of outstanding reports, for each year that the Commission has been operational (2005–2008). Most Part 1 and Part 2 reports are eventually received from CCMs, although the Secretariat‘s compliance reporting has, at times, been hampered by delayed submissions by some CCMs. At the request of TCC5, the Secretariat prepared the latter paper summarizing responses from CCMs to reporting obligations associated with CMMs and Commission decisions. It was noted that some CCMs had pointed out minor errors in the table and that corrections would be made in response."
WCPFC6,51,The EU noted that the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty has changed the fisheries decision-making process to a co-decision process between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. This change is likely to make the process of implementing WCPFC CMMs into EU legislation a more lengthy and time-consuming process than before
WCPFC6,52,"One CCM suggested that the deadline for submission of Part 2 of the Annual Report be changed from 31 July each year to one month prior to the meeting of the TCC. This deadline would be consistent with the deadline for Part 1 of the Annual Report, which is due one month prior to the meeting of the Scientific Committee (SC)."
WCPFC6,53,WCPFC6 agreed to revise the deadline for Part 2 of CCMs’ Annual Reports from 31 July to one month prior to the meeting of the TCC.   3.2 Statements by non-members
WCPFC6,54,No statements of non-members were provided to WCPFC6.   AGENDA  ITEM  4  -  SCIENCE ISSUES 4.1 Report of the Fifth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee
WCPFC6,55,"The Chair of the Scientific Committee, Dr Naozumi Miyabe (Japan), provided a summary of the Fifth Regular Session of the Scientific Committee (SC5), which was held 10–21August, 2009 at Port Vila, Vanuatu."
WCPFC6,56,"Dr John Hampton from SPC‘s Oceanic Fisheries Programme (SPC-OFP, which is also the scientific services provider), made a presentation on an overview of the fisheries and the status of the stocks as discussed at SC5. The provisional total Western Central Pacific Convention Area (WCPCA) tuna catch for 2008 was estimated at 2,426,195 t, the highest annual catch recorded, but only 26,000 t higher than the previous record in 2007. During 2008, the purse-seine fishery accounted for an estimated 1,783,669 t (74% of the total catch, and a record for this fishery), with the pole-and-line taking an estimated 170,805 t (7%), the longline fishery an estimated 231,003 t 9  (10%), and the remainder (10%) taken by troll gear and a variety of artisanal gears, mostly in eastern Indonesia and the Philippines. The WCPCA tuna catch (2,426,195 t) for 2008 represented 81% of the total Pacific Ocean catch of 3,009,477 t, and 56% of the global tuna catch (the provisional global estimate for 2008 is just over 4.3 million t)."
WCPFC6,57,"The skipjack stock assessment undertaken in 2008 indicates that the skipjack stock is not in an overfished state, nor is overfishing occurring. The yellowfin tuna stock assessment undertaken in 2009 indicates that overall, the stock is not in an overfished state, nor is overfishing occurring; however, there is heavy exploitation in the western equatorial Pacific where 95% of the fishery occurs, and the current status is due to the buffering that occurs as a result of low levels of exploitation in adjacent subtropical areas. The streamlined bigeye stock assessment undertaken in 2009 indicates that the stock is nearing an overfished state and that overfishing is occurring. The South Pacific albacore assessment undertaken in 2009 indicates that the stock is not in an overfished state, nor is overfishing occurring, however there is a moderate level of depletion of the portion of the stock targeted by the longline fisheries active within the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of several countries."
WCPFC6,58,"In response to questions, Dr Hampton provided the following additional information:  a. Although fishing mortality for bigeye is much greater than the fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield (MSY), stock biomass has not declined as might have been expected because recruitment during the last decade has been higher than average. If recruitment were to fall, the stock biomass would decline to levels below current levels (estimated to be 20% of unfished biomass). Biomass trajectories of tuna populations at such low stock sizes are not well known but such a situation could lead to rapid and cascading further declines.   b. No specific assumptions are made in the models for unreported catches, although the models do take into account illegal or unregulated catches. c. Sets on unassociated yellowfin tuna usually catch larger-sized individuals.Thus, if a fish aggregation device (FAD) closure leads to more sets on un-associated schools, yellowfin catches would be expected to increase. d. In the forthcoming (2010) stock assessment for skipjack, SPC will work with Japanese scientists to expand the model area and incorporate information on regional migration patterns. e. It is not clear whether inward migration from other areas of the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) compensate for the estimated stock declines in the western portion of the WCPO (Region 3), but new tagging information should indicate whether such a buffering effect may occur. f. The significantly increasing number of yellowfin catches in recent years is due to a large reported increase in medium to large un-associated purse-seine sets. The increased number of skipjack catches are part of a pattern of increasing catches in the early 1980s and since 2000; these will be further investigated.   g. The WCPFC and IATTC stock assessments assume that there are separate stocks of bigeye in the WCPO and eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). This assumption has been tested in several ways over the years and the results support the conclusion that stock assessment results based on this assumption are not dissimilar to those based on a single-stock hypothesis. h. The stock assessments make good use of a long and detailed historical dataset on yellowfin length and weight extending back to 1950. 10  i. Because the stock assessments presented were conducted in early 2009 and based on data through 2008, they are not able to assist in evaluating CMM 2008-01. Results of an evaluation of CMM 2008-01 are discussed in detail under Agenda Item 9.1."
WCPFC6,59,"WCPFC 6 accepted the following recommendations and findings from the SC on status of the stock and management advice and implications as contained in the SC5 Summary Report:    a. Yellowfin exploitation rates differ between regions, and exploitation rates continue to be highest in the western equatorial region. It is recommended that there be no increase in yellowfin fishing mortality (F) in the western equatorial region (para. 180 of the SC5 Summary Report);  b. The recommendations and work plan items relevant to FAD marking and monitoring are supported (para. 188); c. There is a role for the SC to consider scientific elements of capacity monitoring and measurement which is included within the terms of reference of the Fishing Technology Specialist Working Group (para. 215);   d. Because no new information on the stock status of skipjack was presented to SC5, the management recommendations from SC4 are maintained (para. 216); e. There is no indication that current catch levels of South Pacific albacore are not sustainable with regard to recruitment overfishing (para. 221);  f. On the basis of the 2008 stock assessment, it was recommended that the catch limits specified in CMM 2008-05 for South Pacific swordfish be carried forward to future years as a continuing measure (para. 224); g. Because no stock assessment was conducted for southwest Pacific striped marlin in 2009, the stock status description and management recommendations from SC2 are still current (para. 225); h. The fishing mortality rate of striped marlin in the North Pacific Ocean should be reduced from the current level (2003 or before). Noting that this is a bycatch species, mitigation methods should be explored in order to achieve the necessary reductions in fishing mortality (para. 234);  i. Until the Commission identifies and formally adopts appropriate reference points for northern stocks, the performance of the fishery against MSY-based reference points should be evaluated (para. 239);  j. The previous recommendation for North Pacific albacore of not increasing F from current levels (Fcurrent(2002-2004) = 0.75) is still valid; however, with the projection based on the continued current high F, the fishing mortality rate will have to be reduced (para. 245);  k. Regarding Pacific bluefin tuna (para. 259 and 263):   i. If F remains at the current level and environmental conditions remain favorable, the recruitment should be sufficient to maintain current yield well into the future.  ii. A reduction in F in combination with favorable environmental conditions, should lead to greater spawners per recruit (SPR).  iii. Increases in F above the current level, and/or unfavorable changes in environmental conditions, may result in recruitment levels that are insufficient to sustain the current productivity of the stock.  iv. Given the conclusions of the May–June 2008 stock assessment with regard to the current level of F relative to potential target reference points (TRPs) and limit reference points (LRPs), and residual uncertainties associated with key model parameters, it is important that the current level of F is not increased.  11  v. Given the conclusions of the July 2009 ISC Pacific Bluefin Tuna Working Group, the current level of F relative to potential biological reference points, and increasing trend of juvenile F, it is important that the current level of F is decreased below the 2002–2004 levels on juvenile age classes; l. The preferred hypothesis for North Pacific swordfish is that there are two stocks, one in the WCPO and the other in the EPO, with little or no mixing between them (paras. 264–267);   m. Both stocks of swordfish in the North Pacific Ocean are healthy and well above levels required to sustain recent catches; therefore, no management advice was provided (para. 268)."
WCPFC6,60,"The following recommendations of SC5 relating to status of the stock and management advice and implications as contained in the SC5 Summary Report were deferred to other items of the WCPFC6 agenda for discussion:    a. While SC recommends a 30% reduction in F of bigeye  from the 2001–2004 levels to return to FMSY, recent assessment indicates that a 34–50% reduction in F from the 2004–2007 levels would be required to reduce F to sustainable levels (para. 175, i-iii—deferred to Agenda Item 9.1); b. Assessment of bigeye stock status and evaluation of CMMs should be undertaken on an annual basis (para. 175, iv-vi—deferred to Agenda Item 9.1); c. CMM 2008-01 is likely to achieve its objective for yellowfin, but extremely unlikely to achieve its most important objective for bigeye. The SC requested the science service provider (SPC) to assess potential measures to reduce F on bigeye to 30% below 2001–2004 levels (para. 210—deferred to Agenda Item 9.1);"
WCPFC6,61,"Findings and recommendations of SC5 as contained in the SC5 Summary Report on the following topics were also accepted by WCPFC6:   a. Ecological risk assessment and SEAPODYM projects (para. 283); b. Seabirds (para. 286); c. Sharks (para. 288); d. Sea turtles (para. 290); e. Small tuna on floating objects (paras. 312-314); f. Data gaps and progress toward addressing them (para. 321, item i-v; item vi discussed under WCPFC6 Agenda Item 9.4); g. Indonesia and Philippines Data Collection Project /WPEA OFM Project (para. 360); h. Tagging initiative (paras. 361–362); i. Unloading data (para. 367); j. Review of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SPC and relations to other organizations (paras. 371–372 and discussed under WCPFC6 Agenda Item 13);  k. Development of new MOUs (para. 375); l. Special requirements of developing states (para. 385); m. Next meeting (para. 408); n. Election of SC‘s Vice-Chair (para. 409); o. Meeting of the five tuna regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) (para. 411).   p."
WCPFC6,62,"With regard to the recommendation in SC5 Summary Report, para. 321, item ii, one CCM suggested that the work should not be limited to charter arrangements. The Executive 12  Director clarified that the work pertains to vessels under ―charter, lease or other arrangements‖.  This work was further discussed under Agenda Item 9.1."
WCPFC6,63,"Also with regard to para. 321, one CCM stated that catch in zones should be attributed to the charter State, whereas catch on the high seas should be attributed to the flag State rather than the charter State."
WCPFC6,64,"Again with regard to para. 321, FFA members stated that catches should be attributed to the chartering country, including in high seas waters. FFA members also underscored the importance of ensuring that all CCMs abide by the mandatory rules of data provision as agreed on by the Commission, noting that deferments based on domestic legal constraints cannot be invoked indefinitely. In the case that such deferments continue, a comprehensive update on means and timeframes for overcoming the constraints should be requested by the Commission."
WCPFC6,65,"The Commission noted that there was some misunderstanding among CCMs at SC5 in relation to the SC‘s ability to provide advice to, make requests of, and seek expert advice from the NC, the ISC and the TCC. The Commission noted its common understanding on this issue, as contained in Article 11(5) of the Convention, which states that: ―In the exercise of their functions, each Committee may, where appropriate, consult any other fisheries management, technical or scientific organization with competence in the subject matter of such consultation and may seek expert advice as required on an ad hoc basis.‖ 4.2 Independent Review of Interim Arrangements for Science Structure and Function"
WCPFC6,66,Three recommendations from the SC5 Summary Report were presented by the SC Chair and agreed by WCPFC6 on the following topics: a. Obtaining ISC data (refer to para. 336 of the SC5 Summary Report); b. Peer review of stock assessment (para. 399); c. Future operations of the SC (paras. 404 and 407);
WCPFC6,67,"With regard to peer review of stock assessments, WCPFC6 agreed that the bigeye stock assessment should be the target of the peer review exercise. In order to achieve the maximum benefit from such a peer review, it was agreed that the peer review should be timed so as to ensure that the latest, full bigeye stock assessment for the WCPO (i.e. the 2010 WCPO bigeye assessment) is reviewed. It was noted that IATTC was also planning a peer review of a planned 2010 assessment for bigeye in the EPO and that the outcome of that review could usefully inform the bigeye assessment in the WCPO. The results of the peer review for the WCPO bigeye assessment should be reported to the WCPFC no later than WCPFC8 (December 2011).   4.3 Reference Points"
WCPFC6,68,The recommendation from the SC5 Summary Report concerning reference points (para. 277) was discussed.
WCPFC6,69,"Several FFA members spoke in support of the capacity building elements of the reference point work plan, in particular the workshop and ensuring that future work take full account of the multi-species nature of the fishery. However, some of these CCMs noted that capacity building needs may be broader than simply the topic of reference points (e.g. management procedures for multi-species fisheries, socioeconomic factors, harmonizing in zone and high seas management, etc.).    13"
WCPFC6,70,A number of CCMs voiced their concerns about endorsing proposals for technical work without full consideration of whether there will be adequate funding available as determined by the outcomes of the FAC meeting. Other CCMs expressed concerns about personnel workloads and intersessional meeting schedules.
WCPFC6,71,"Three CCMs noted that the work on reference points would facilitate informed decision-making on a revised CMM for bigeye, if necessary, at WCPFC7."
WCPFC6,72,"WCPFC6 endorsed both the short- and medium-term work plans on reference points recommended by SC5, with the proviso that adequate funding support will be secured.   4.4 Programme of work for the Scientific Committee in 2010"
WCPFC6,73,"The SC Chair noted that the proposed budget for the science programme of work for 2010 was increased by US$ 150,000 over the 2009 budget. The indicative budget for 2010 was US$ 700,000. Funding support for science services contracted from SPC-OFP and independent projects carried over from previous years (US$ 216,500) resulted in a small unallocated amount of US$ 12,050 to support other activities. The total science budget proposed by SC5 for 2010 was US$ 928,550."
WCPFC6,74,"Projects within the SC‘s work programme are either already funded by the Commission or another party; require external funding or support from individual CCMs or groups of CCMs; or are requesting Commission funding under the budget to be agreed at WCPFC6. The following projects, which are recommended for the consideration of the Commission by SC5, include:   a. Project 14. (Priority = High) Indonesia and Philippines Data Collection Project (IPDCP) – now WPEA OFM Project:  US$ 75,000; b. Project 35. (Priority = High) Refinement of bigeye parameters Pacific-wide:  a comprehensive review and study of bigeye tuna reproductive biology:  US$ 30,000; c. Project 39. (Priority = High)  Regional study of the stock structure and life-history characteristics of South Pacific albacore:  US$ 25,000; d. Project 42. (Priority = High) Pacific-wide tagging project:  US$ 10,000; e. Project 56. (Priority = Medium) Use of underwater videos and other tools to characterize species, size composition and spatial distribution of tunas aggregating around floating objects:  US$ 2,000; f. Project 57. (Priority = High)  Identifying Provisional Limit Reference Points for the key target species in the WCPFC:  US$ 20,000; and g. Project 60. (Priority = High) Collection and evaluation of purse-seine species composition data:  US$ 54,500."
WCPFC6,75,Some CCMs requested detailed budget breakdowns in order to justify the costs and determine whether any cost savings could be achieved.
WCPFC6,76,"These and other queries caused some CCMs to question the process by which i) the SC prioritizes projects, ii) the Commission approves the projects, and iii) the FAC allocates funding for these projects. These CCMs were concerned that prioritization of projects is not the responsibility of the FAC, yet there was no clear process by which limited funding is allocated among competing priority projects. This is particularly of concern when the budget is not sufficient to support all projects recommended as high priority by the Commissions‘ subsidiary bodies.    14"
WCPFC6,77,"While noting that the SC follows a rigorous prioritization process, other CCMs called for a more formalized strategic planning process to guide project prioritization by the Commission. On this basis, a draft strategic plan, which had been under consideration by the Commission since WCPFC2 in Samoa, was further refined by FAC3 during WCPFC6 (WCPFC6-2009/27)."
WCPFC6,78,WCPFC6 approved the seven priority projects listed above (para. 74) subject to confirmation of available budget by the FAC.
WCPFC6,79,WCPFC6 approved SC5‘s recommendation that the science services provider conduct assessments of WCPO bigeye and skipjack for consideration at SC6.
WCPFC6,80,"FFA members made some general comments concerning stock assessments prepared by the science services provider. The need to assess scenarios relevant to the baseline and other measures specified in the CMMs was stressed. In addition to quantifying uncertainty, it was suggested that specific recommendations about the required magnitude of management intervention should be provided. Finally, these CCMs expressed concerns about the labelling of stock assessments as ―streamlined‖ and using this to dilute the scientific advice derived from these assessments.   AGENDA  ITEM  5  -  NORTHERN COMMITTEE 5.1 Report of the Fifth Regular Session of the Northern Committee and Issues Arising"
WCPFC6,81,"The Chair of the Northern Committee, Masanori Miyahara (Japan), introduced the outcomes of the Fifth Regular Session of the Northern Committee (NC5) held 7–10 September 2009 in Nagasaki, Japan."
WCPFC6,82,"With regard to formulating management measures for striped marlin in the North Pacific, the NC Chair explained that although a 2007 stock assessment indicated that a reduction in fishing effort for this species is required, it has not been designated as a northern stock and thus the NC was constrained in developing a draft CMM. However, efforts toward a draft CMM for North Pacific striped marlin were pursued in the margins of WCPFC6 and are discussed further under Agenda Item 9.4."
WCPFC6,83,"FFA members called attention to the need to scrutinize reference points for northern stocks before such reference points are applied, and stated that since striped marlin in the North Pacific has not been designated as a northern stock, it would be inappropriate for the NC to lead the development of a CMM for this species. However, these CCMs welcomed the development of a management measure for striped marlin in the North Pacific in the margins of WCPFC6 and encouraged compatibility in management measures between WCPFC and IATTC for northern stocks."
WCPFC6,84,"With regard to a draft CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna (WCPFC-2009/DP07, discussed further under Agenda 9.4), the NC Chair noted that good progress was made with the exception of obtaining consensus from Korea, which requested more time to study the species in its own waters. A draft CMM providing for total fishing effort for Pacific bluefin tuna not to be increased from 2001–2004 levels and reduced fishing mortality on Pacific bluefin tuna juveniles, with a one-year exemption for the Korean EEZ, was agreed by the NC. The NC Chair expressed his expectation that Korea would join in the management measures for this species after the one-year exemption expires.    15"
WCPFC6,85,"Four CCMs, two of whom are also members of the NC, joined the Chair in expressing their concern regarding the exemption for the Korean EEZ and the need to implement the management measures across all fisheries catching Pacific bluefin tuna as of 2011."
WCPFC6,86,"Korea stated that the catch of Pacific bluefin, most of which occurs around Cheju Island, is mainly bycatch and amounts to less than 1,500 t. Korea is undertaking a research programme costing over US$ 1 million to understand more about the status and catch of the species in Korean waters."
WCPFC6,87,"In response to the preceding intervention by Korea, Japan queried the characterization of Korea‘s Pacific bluefin tuna catch as bycatch based on a comparison with its own records from the area. Korea corrected its statement on bycatch by saying that, in Korean law, there is no concept of bycatch or target species. Fishing licenses are permitted by fishing gear type and purse-seine vessels mainly targeting mackerels take Pacific bluefin tun,a which accounts for less than 1% of total catch by the purse-seine vessels."
WCPFC6,88,"In response to a separate question regarding catches of juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna by purse-seine vessels, Japan explained that it has implemented a voluntary minimum fish size limit of 2 kg for purse-seine vessels. Japan also explained its intention to introduce a programme to collect information on Pacific bluefin tuna imported from Korea. Comments regarding the importance of Mexico in developing management measures for this species were reiterated (see Section 2.2)."
WCPFC6,89,"The IATTC informed WCPFC that its staff will soon recommend a similar management measure for Pacific bluefin tuna for IATTC adoption. The IATTC holds substantial observer data on Pacific bluefin tuna catches and these data, and IATTC expertise, are being shared with the ISC for scientific purposes."
WCPFC6,90, The NC Chair announced that a joint meeting between the NC and IATTC is planned in order to discuss Pacific bluefin tuna management measures across the North Pacific and that CCMs and scientists will be invited to attend.
WCPFC6,91,"With regard to the NC‘s recommended revised CMM for North Pacific albacore (WCPFC-2009/DP06 which, if adopted, would replace CMM 2005-03), the NC Chair highlighted that concerns expressed by other CCMs, which are not members of the NC, centre on the southern extent of the applicable area of the CMM: either north of 20o north latitude or north from the equator. This issue is further discussed under Agenda Item 9.1."
WCPFC6,92,"Two CCMs, who are also NC members, noted that the last assessment for North Pacific albacore was conducted in 2006 based on data from 2005 and expressed concern that the next assessment is not scheduled until 2011. It was considered by these CCMs that a stock assessment should occur at least every third year."
WCPFC6,93,"The Chair of the ISC stated that constraints on staffing and funding prohibit more frequent stock assessments being carried out. In addition, much of the biological data necessary for the assessments is old and needs to be re-assessed. ISC also needs to find time to progress development of reference points. For these reasons, ISC will progress stock assessments in as timely and responsive a manner as possible given the substantial constraints."
WCPFC6,94,FFA members stated that all scientific advice should be channelled to the Commission through the SC in order to promote consistency of standards and processes.   16
WCPFC6,95,"At the request of Japan, the Secretariat agreed to establish a voluntary fund for contributions to the NC to support the work of the ISC, particularly on updating biological data for stock assessment species.  Contributions by NC members to the fund are encouraged."
WCPFC6,96,The USA requested further investigation into whether the ISC has the appropriate international agency to receive such funding.   5.2 Programme of work for the Northern Committee in 2010
WCPFC6,97,"The NC Chair referred to the programme of work contained in Attachment E of the NC5 Summary Report. He also noted the following current and future work items arising from NC5:   a. Based on the results of the 2009 North Pacific swordfish stock assessment, NC5 found that no management measures are necessary; b. NC5 notes SC5‘s recommendation to include silky sharks in the key of key shark species (WCPFC6-2009/IP14); c. NC5 acknowledges the importance of shark issues and an intention to study northern shark species and report to the Commission in future; d. Biological data are very old in some cases and should be updated through collaborative work between NC5 and ISC; e. The MOU with ISC should remain unchanged; f. While needs for peer review will continue to be discussed, it was considered that the ISC already incorporates a built-in peer review process; and g. Revision to the MOU between WCPFC and SPC that was reviewed by NC5, awaits a decision by the Commission (see Agenda Item 13)."
WCPFC6,98,The WCPFC Chairman thanked the Chair of the NC for his efforts.
WCPFC6,99,WCPFC6 accepted the report of NC5.   AGENDA  ITEM  6  -  INTER-SESSIONAL WORKING GROUP – REGIONAL OBSERVER PROGRAMME 6.1 Report of the Third Meeting of the Intersessional Working Group
WCPFC6,100,"The Chair of the IWG-ROP, Dr Charles Karnella (USA), presented the Summary Report of the Third Meeting of the Regional Observer Programme‘s Intersessional Working Group (ROP-IWG3) (WCPFC6-2009/13)."
WCPFC6,101,"The Chair noted agreement was reached on the following issues: minimum standards; vessel safety checks; observer trainer qualifications; liability and insurance; Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for observer deployment; and authorization of de-briefers and requirements for de-briefing. The ROP-IWG also agreed: that observer placement costs would be borne by the observer provider; the fisheries to be monitored and coverage levels; to establish a cadre of observers (to serve the Secretariat in special situations), and on the use of ROP workbooks."
WCPFC6,102,"Consensus was not reached on vessel size limits (i.e. whether small vessels can carry observers); the source of observers (i.e. a definition of the hybrid approach); and definitions of ―adjacent‖, ―occasional‖, ―principally‖, ―independent‖ and ―impartial‖, and ―observer trip‖.    17"
WCPFC6,103,"Other items for which work is still ongoing include costs associated with data management; ROP requirements for at-sea transhipment; technological solutions as an alternative to observers; special requirements for developing States; the ROP website; and WPCFC/IATTC observer cross-endorsement. Data forms are also needed for observer monitoring of FAD closure periods as well as a practical, working definition of a ―FAD set‖ (see further discussion under Agenda Item 9.1)."
WCPFC6,104,The Chair of the ROP-IWG proposed that as the IWG had progressed matters as far as it could at this point in the evolution of the Commission‘s observer programme the IWG should be disbanded and become an ad hoc advisory group. The ROP-IWG recommended that a technical advisory group be established to provide the Commission‘s Observer Programme Coordinator (OPC) with continuing support in the development and implementation of the ROP.
WCPFC6,105,The WCPFC Chairman thanked Dr Karnella and the ROP-IWG for their contributions to the development of the Commission‘s observer programme during the last two years.
WCPFC6,106,"FFA members spoke in favor of adopting the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) definition of FAD set within the WCPFC to ensure consistency. FFA members opposed the creation of an ROP-Technical and Operational Advisory Group (TOAG) as discussed at TCC5 citing concerns regarding cost and time, and the availability of other means of obtaining ad hoc advice for the ROP."
WCPFC6,107,WCPFC6 agreed to discontinue consideration of formation of an ROP TOAG.   AGENDA  ITEM  7  -  TECHNICAL AND COMPLIANCE ISSUES 7.1 Report of the Fifth Regular Sessions of the Technical and Compliance Committee
WCPFC6,108,"The Chair of the Technical and Compliance Committee, Ambassador Wendell Sanford (Canada) presented the Summary Report of the Fifth Technical and Compliance Committee meeting (TCC5), held in Palikir, Federated States of Micronesia from 1–6 October 2009.  a. Recommendations contained in the TCC5 report"
WCPFC6,109,"The following recommendations of TCC5 were considered and approved by WCPFC6 (reference to TCC5 Summary Report) without further discussion at WCPFC6:    a. Accept the recommendations of the ROP-IWG3 Summary Report and attachments (para. 14); b. CCMs should implement the ROP (CMM 2007-01) and report on their progress in Part 2 of their 2010 Annual Reports, including how they will achieve 5% coverage for their longline fleets by June 2012 (para. 15); c. Adoption of ―Minimum Standard Data Fields for Purse-Seine FAD Monitoring‖ (para. 38); d. Noted the first annual report of the ROP (para. 48); e. Task the TCC with assessing the suitability of the CNM application process and CNM status with States with only carriers and/or bunkers and provide recommendations to the Commission as to whether a modified or separate process and/or status should be developed for such States and what the process and status 18  should be and to complete this work by 2011 (para. 96, incorporated into draft Strategic Plan (Agenda Item 11); f. Outcomes of the Ad Hoc Task Group (AHTG)–Data relating to supplementary rules and procedures for surveillance and enforcement on the high seas and the use of VMS data for scientific purposes and refinements to provision of data so that the identification of individual vessels is not disclosed (paras. 113–114; see Agenda Item 8); g. Preliminary assessment of CNM applications (paras. 358–364, Agenda Item 2); h. The draft work programme and budget, with amendments proposed during TCC5, be considered by the FAC (para. 397, Agenda Item 11);  i. Agree to implement an independent performance review in early 2010 (para. 405, Agenda Item 16.1); j. Accept the draft MOU with NPAFC (para. 407, Agenda Item 13);  k. Not accept para 1(c) of the draft data exchange arrangement with IATTC (para. 410, Agenda Item 13); l. Accept the nomination of officers for the positions of Chair and Vice-Chair (para 413, Agenda Item 15); m. Accept the recommendation for date and place of TCC6 (para. 415, Agenda Item 17)."
WCPFC6,110,"In noting the TCC Summary Report, para. 388, regarding the aspirations of SIDS, Palau on behalf of FFA members thanked those CCMs who contributed to monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) discussions under the special requirements agenda item at TCC5. Palau, on behalf of FFA members, also proposed that development CCMs report on their progress in implementing Article 30 of the Convention and Resolution 2008-01 to each WCPFC session.   b. Items from TCC5 subject to further discussion under Agenda Item 9 (CMMs)"
WCPFC6,111,"Other proposals considered by TCC5 and discussed by WCPFC6 under Agenda Item 9, as indicated, include those involving FAD closure and catch retention for the high seas (para. 30, Agenda Item 9.1), cross endorsement of observers (para. 65, Agenda Item 9.4), draft CMM on regulation of transhipment (para. 83, Agenda Item 9.4), revision of CMM 2004-01 concerning carriers and bunkers (para. 95, Agenda Item 9.1), draft CMM on charter notification (para.105, Agenda Item 9.4), control of nationals (para. 248, Agenda Item 9.4), draft CMM on IUU Vessel Listing (para. 254, Agenda Item 9.1), Stateless vessels (para. 259, Agenda Item 9.4), Data buoys (para. 287, 9.4), Compliance with CMM Working Group  (para. 328, Agenda Item 9.4), Seabird By-catch Mitigation (para. 336, Agenda Item 9.1), Port Sampling and Monitoring (para. 346, Agenda Item 9.1), Sea Turtle Mitigation (para. 351, Agenda Item 9.1), and Port State Measures (para. 370, Agenda Item 9.4).   c. Issues arising from TCC5 for discussion at WCPFC6 which were not deferred to Agenda Item 9 (CMMs) 2009 FAD Closure Report (TCC5 Summary Report, para. 36)"
WCPFC6,112,"It was noted that a report requested from the Secretariat on the 2009 FAD closures (para. 36) could not be prepared as the data were received only within the week leading up to WCPFC6.  WCPFC6 agreed that a full report on the 2009 FAD closures will be prepared for discussion at TCC6.    ROP Data Management Options (TCC5 Summary Report, para.56)  19"
WCPFC6,113,"Various options for managing ROP data were discussed, including a hybrid option that the Secretariat was requested to prepare following discussions at TCC5 (WPCFC6-2009/IP-08)."
WCPFC6,114,"Some CCMs, including FFA members, favored ROP data management Option 5.1, stating that cost-effectiveness and using existing regional institutions were important considerations.  Economies of scale between the ROP and the FFA observer programmes, data validation benefits, and the long, existing and strong relationship between SPC and WCPFC, were cited as three additional reasons to involve SPC in this task."
WCPFC6,115,"Other CCMs considered the WCPFC, as an independent organization, should establish its own data management capabilities, and noted that the cost for this option was lower than the option of using SPC‘s facilities in Noumea. Some of these CCMs expressed concerns regarding a potential conflict of interest between SPC as data manager for SPC members and SPC as the science services provider to WCPFC."
WCPFC6,116,"One CCM, who is also an FFA member, noted the desire of FFA members to develop their own domestic data entry capabilities over time."
WCPFC6,117,"  WCPFC6 agreed that a draft transitional plan for consideration of financial aspects be prepared for the consideration of TCC6.  VMS Implementation (TCC5 Summary Report, paras. 115–143)"
WCPFC6,118,"In response to a question from the TCC Chair regarding implementation of the VMS in the northwest quadrant of the Convention Area by Japan, Japan responded that the issue is under consideration but it is not in position to confirm the details at this time."
WCPFC6,119,A revised draft of the VMS SOPS was produced and circulated by the Secretariat after TCC5 (WCPFC6-2009/IP-11).
WCPFC6,120,"Subsequently, WCPFC6 agreed the proposed amendments to Sections 4.5 and 4.8 of the VMS SOPs as contained in WCPFC6-2009/29 (Attachment Q)."
WCPFC6,121,FFA members called for a review of cost recovery options for VMS costs to be prepared by the Secretariat for discussion at TCC6.
WCPFC6,122,"With regard to further work on VMS SSPs, CCMs including the USA and FFA members who have been working on this issue, reported several outstanding issues, such as manual reporting in the event of VMS failure, remain to be settled.    IUU Vessel Listing Procedures regarding ownership and associated vessels (CMM 2007-03, para. 3j) (TCC5 Summary Report, paras.230–238)."
WCPFC6,123,The TCC Chair summarised the issue relating to para. 3j as discussed at TCC5.
WCPFC6,124,Korea made a statement against the use of para. 3j claiming that it could lead to unfair punishment of owners of related vessels and could promote the splintering of corporate structures in order to avoid potential liabilities.
WCPFC6,125,Several CCMs spoke in favor of elaborating on the process for applying para. 3j and then discussing this issue again at TCC6.   20
WCPFC6,126,FFA members and the USA reiterated that deferral of the application of para. 3j for one year would be the last deferral and was only to allow time to develop procedures for applying it.
WCPFC6,127,FFA members suggested that the procedures need to account for application to chartered and co-owned vessels.
WCPFC6,128,"WCPFC6 agreed that specific procedures for applying CMM 2007-03, para. 3j would be developed for discussion at TCC6 to be facilitated by the USA.    Annual Report Templates and Reporting Data Gaps (TCC5 Summary Report, para. 292)"
WCPFC6,129,"The Executive Director introduced a revised template for the Annual Report, Part 2 (WCPFC-2009-TCC5/19), noting that the template must be updated every year to account for new CMMs."
WCPFC6,130,"FFA members stated they would propose revisions to the Annual Report, Part 2 template for discussion at TCC6 noting that CCMs wish to improve their capacity to complete the template themselves."
WCPFC6,131,"Several CCMs echoed the recommendation of TCC5 (TCC5 Summary Report, para. 325) stating that reporting gaps identified in Secretariat summaries of the CCM Annual Reports should be attributed to individual CCMs."
WCPFC6,132,"WCPFC6 agreed the revised Annual Report, Part 2 template (Attachment R) for use in 2010, noting that the deadline was revised to one month prior to the meeting of the TCC (Agenda 3.1).    Catch Documentation Schemes (TCC5 Summary Report, para. 376)"
WCPFC6,133,"FFA members stated that they did not support holding an intersessional workshop on developing a catch documentation scheme (CDS), however they plan to apply to the Japan Trust Fund to obtain funding to develop a CDS prior to TCC6. FFA members also noted that CDS and related issues may be discussed at the Kobe2 workshop on monitoring, control and surveillance to be held in the EU in June 2010."
WCPFC6,134,The EU had submitted a proposal for CDS in 2006 and recommended that any other proposed CDS be developed with an awareness of the data requirements of catch certificates associated with the EU IUU fishing regulation being implemented on 1 January 2010 and the new FAO Port State Measures Agreement.
WCPFC6,135,"WPCFC6 agreed in principle on the need for a CDS, and taking note of an offer by Niue as FFC Chair to lead the process, called for a proposal to be brought forward for discussion at TCC6.    CNM Procedure Flowchart (TCC5 Summary Report, para. 381)"
WCPFC6,136,The USA informed WCPFC6 that a revised flowchart on CNM procedures (WCPFC6-2009/DP37) had been circulated incorporating the comments received from one CCM at TCC5.
WCPFC6,137, The revised flowchart is appended as Attachment S. 21  d. WCPFC IUU Vessel List
WCPFC6,138,WCPFC6 considered the Provisional IUU Vessel List prepared by TCC5.
WCPFC6,139,"Regarding the Lina, an Indonesian-flagged vessel, the USA and France summarized their respective nomination information as presented in detail at TCC5. The USA stated that the Lina was documented fishing in the WCPFC Convention Area without being on the WCPFC RFV and without having been authorized by Indonesia to fish in the Convention Area. France stated that the vessel had conducted fishing operations in the Convention Area without being on the WCPFC RFV."
WCPFC6,140,"Subsequent to TCC5, Indonesia responded to a letter from the Executive Director notifying it that the Lina had been placed on the Provisional IUU Vessel List, stating that the owners of the vessel had admitted to the violations and would accept the sanction of the Indonesian government but that investigation of the incident was still underway."
WCPFC6,141,"At WCPFC6, Indonesia stated that it had sent a letter of warning to the vessel, but because the Lina was still at sea, more time was needed to complete its investigations of the incident. It stated its strong commitment to combating IUU activities, noting extenuating circumstances surrounding TCC5, which occurred at the time of the Indonesian presidential elections. Indonesia noted that the Lina is now on the WPCFC RFV (as of October 2009), and is also on the Organization for Promotion of Responsible Tuna Fisheries (OPRT) vessel list."
WCPFC6,142,"Some CCMs spoke in support of Indonesia on the basis that the violation occurred due to an administrative error, rather than any action by the fishing master, and stating that because Indonesia is a developing State it should be given special consideration."
WCPFC6,143,"During WCPFC6, and after consulting with officials in Jakarta, Indonesia issued letters to the USA and France, and informed WPCF6 of the content of these letters (Attachment T)."
WCPFC6,144,"The USA stated that because the letter maintains that sanctions will be imposed in the future, and because it is not clear what rights the owner or master may have to appeal the sanction under Indonesian law, the USA intended to carry through with the listing of the Lina. If documentation is provided showing that the sanction was imposed, procedures for de-listing intersessionally will be considered."
WCPFC6,145,"France stated that the IUU listing procedures under CMM 2007-03 must be followed.  These procedures require that until material warranties are provided showing appropriate actions have been taken, listing is the appropriate action, and once such warranties are received, and if sanctions are applied effectively, de-listing can be initiated."
WCPFC6,146,WCPFC6 agreed by consensus to list the Lina on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,147,"Concerning Senta, a Panamanian-flagged vessel nominated by France, France explained that the Senta is a carrier vessel found with fish in its hold from the Minako, an Indonesia-flagged fishing vessel. Neither the Senta nor the Minako were on the WCPFC RFV at the time of the incident."
WCPFC6,148,"Subsequent to TCC5, Panama did not respond to a letter from the Executive Director informing it that the Senta had been placed on the Provisional IUU Vessel List.  22"
WCPFC6,149," Dr Tsamenyi, WCPFC Legal Advisor, advised that Panama is not a member of the WCPFC and therefore not bound by the CMMs adopted by the Commission. However, Panama is a party to the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and is thereby obliged to ensure that its flagged vessels do not undermine the CMMs adopted by the WCPFC."
WCPFC6,150,WCPFC6 agreed by consensus to list the Senta on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,151,"The Minako, an Indonesian-flagged vessel nominated by France, was found to have transhipped catch to the Senta within the WCPF Convention Area. The Minako was not on the WCPFC RFV at the time of the incident. In listing the Minako on the Provisional IUU Vessel List, TCC5 considered that the Minako had fished in the WCPF Convention Area."
WCPFC6,152,"Dr Tsamenyi explained that under para. 3(a) of CMM 2007-03, any fishing vessel that harvests species covered by the WCPFC Convention in the Convention Area, and is not on the WCPFC RFV, or is not fishing exclusively in waters under the jurisdiction of its flag State, can be considered to be conducting IUU fishing activities."
WCPFC6,153,"Subsequent to TCC5, Indonesia responded to a letter from the Executive Director notifying it that the Minako had been placed on the Provisional IUU Vessel List, stating that the owners of the vessel had admitted to the violations and would accept the sanction of the Indonesian government but that an investigation of the incident was still underway."
WCPFC6,154,"As with the Lina, some CCMs spoke in favor of granting leniency to Indonesia on the grounds that it is a developing country."
WCPFC6,155,"During WCPFC6, and after consulting with officials in Jakarta, Indonesia issued a letter to France concerning the Lina and the Minako (Attachment U)."
WCPFC6,156,"France maintained the same position regarding the Minako as it did regarding the Lina, and stated that given the currently available evidence, listing is required. Once material warranties are provided documenting the effective imposition of the sanction, de-listing can be considered."
WCPFC6,157,WCPFC6 agreed by consensus to list the Minako on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,158,"Regarding the Chia Shun Hsing No. 6, a Chinese Taipei-flagged vessel, it was noted at TCC5 that settlement negotiations were underway but an agreement had not yet been reached.  Subsequent to TCC5, the USA informed WCPFC6 that the matter had been settled to its satisfaction."
WCPFC6,159,WCFPC agreed by consensus not to list the Chia Shun Hsing No. 6 on the WPCFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,160,"Regarding the Maan Feng Yu No. 36, a Chinese Taipei-flagged vessel, it was noted at TCC5 that settlement negotiations were underway but an agreement had not yet been reached.  Subsequent to TCC5 the USA informed WCPFC6 that the matter had been settled to its satisfaction."
WCPFC6,161,WCFPC agreed by consensus not to list the Maan Feng Yu No. 36 on the WPCFC IUU Vessel List.    23
WCPFC6,162," New Zealand summarized its case for nominating the China-flagged vessels Rong Yuan Yu 86, Rong Yuan Yu 87, Rong Da Yang No.6, Rong Da Yang No.7, Rong Da Yang No.8 and Rong Da Yang No.9.  hese vessels were fishing in the WCPF Convention Area but were not on the WCPFC RFV due to communication issues between China and the WCPFC Secretariat. The vessels were, however, authorized to fish in the Convention Area by China."
WCPFC6,163,"In discussions with China subsequent to TCC5, China stated that it had taken steps to reinforce its vessel authorization procedures. Specifically, China will henceforth require that all vessels are listed on the WCPFC RFV before they are authorized to fish in the Convention Area."
WCPFC6,164,"New Zealand, noting China‘s actions, and China‘s support for an amendment to CMM 2004-01 specifying the responsibility of flag States to ensure their fishing vessels have been placed on the WCPFC RFV before they commence fishing (see Agenda Item 9.1a), stated that the matter had been settled to its satisfaction."
WCPFC6,165,"WCFPC agreed by consensus not to list the Rong Yuan Yu 86, Rong Yuan Yu 87, Rong Da Yang No.6, Rong Da Yang No.7, Rong Da Yang No.8 and Rong Da Yang No.9 on the WPCFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC6,166,"With regard to the Yuh Chang No. 3, a Chinese Taipei-flagged vessel, New Zealand reported that some information on the vessel had been provided to the Secretariat in January 2008, but that at the time of sighting, in September 2008, the vessel was not on the WCPFC RFV, even though it was authorized to fish by Chinese Taipei. New Zealand noted that this incident highlighted the need for more clarity in the administrative process by which the Secretariat places vessels on the RFV (e.g. Secretariat acknowledges receipt of information, notifies the flag State when the vessel is placed on the RFV, and the flag State verifies that the information on the Commission‘s website is correct)."
WCPFC6,167,"New Zealand, noting the circumstances of the incident, as well as Chinese Taipei‘s improved administrative procedures and support for an amendment to CMM 2004-01 (see Agenda Item 9.1a), stated that the matter had been settled to its satisfaction."
WCPFC6,168,WCFPC agreed by consensus not to list the Yuh Chang No. 3 on the WPCFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,169,"Concerning the Yu Fong 168, a Chinese Taipei-flagged vessel, the nominating State, RMI summarized that the vessel had seen sighted fishing inside RMI‘s EEZ but fled, causing damage to an FSM patrol boat in pursuit. The vessel, owner, master and crew have not been located."
WCPFC6,170, Chinese Taipei stated that it had revoked the license for this vessel and removed it from the WCPFC RFV. Chinese Taipei welcomes cooperation from other CCMs to prevent this vessel from continuing to fish illegally.
WCPFC6,171,WCPFC6 agreed by consensus to list the Yu Fong 168 on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,172,"With regard to the Daniela F, a Venezuela-flagged vessel, on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List through nomination by France, WCPFC6 was informed that a French court in Papeete has made a judgement and the vessel has paid the fine. France therefore requested that the Daniela F be removed from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.  24"
WCPFC6,173,WCPFC6 agreed by consensus to remove the Daniela F from the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,174,"FSM informed WCPFC6 that the incident involving the Jinn Feng Tsair #1 has not yet been settled to its satisfaction as the vessel has not yet submitted to justice in the FSM and has not paid any penalty to the FSM. However, dialogue with the flag State, Chinese Taipei, continues and FSM looks forward to resolving this issue in the near future."
WCPFC6,175,Chinese Taipei committed to continuing to try to resolve the incident.
WCPFC6,176,WCPFC6 agreed by consensus to retain the Jinn Feng Tsair #1 on the WCPFC IUU Vessel List.
WCPFC6,177,"Thailand informed WCPFC6 that it had distributed RFMO IUU Vessel Lists to its traders and asked them not to purchase any products from these vessels. In addition, Thailand is amending its fisheries law to prohibit landing of IUU fishing products."
WCPFC6,178,"WCPFC6 discussed issues raised at TCC5 (TCC5 Summary Report, para. 221) concerning alleged incidents of IUU fishing that occurred after 120 days in advance of the TCC meeting, and thus were unable to be brought before TCC5 for consideration as the deadline for CCMs to transmit nominations for the Provisional IUU Vessel List had already passed."
WCPFC6,179,"Reports provided by New Zealand concerning the Ta Chuan 101, Tokelau concerning the Zhao Yuan Yu, and Palau concerning an unnamed vessel indicated that investigations were still underway."
WCPFC6,180,"FSM reported that prosecution of an unnamed vessel accused of unauthorized operations within FSM‘s EEZ is proceeding, and if the case is satisfactorily settled, FSM may not proceed with nomination of the vessel for the WCPFC IUU Vessel List."
WCPFC6,181,These and other CCMs noted their concern with the existing provisions of current listing procedures that would appear to allow vessels to continue fishing on the high seas until the Commission considers whether to list them at WCPFC7 (i.e. potentially for up to 18 months).
WCPFC6,182,"One CCM stated that the 120-day rule is necessary for due process, however, it noted that the WCPFC IUU Vessel List was designed to sanction those vessels that were not sanctioned by their flag States in response to notification of the incident. Thus, if the flag State responds promptly, the vessel can be sanctioned shortly after the incident occurs."
WCPFC6,183,New Zealand informed WCPFC6 that it is considering proposing revisions to CMM 2007-03 for consideration at TCC6 to deal with sanctions for flag States that repeatedly fail to take appropriate actions in response to notification of IUU fishing incidents; improved use of other regional tools to deal with IUU fisheries issues; and an enhanced process for dealing with incidents that occur after the current deadline for nominating vessels for IUU listing of 120 days in advance of the TCC meeting.   e. Adoption of the TCC5 Summary Report
WCPFC6,184,WCPFC6 adopted the TCC5 Summary Report.    25
WCPFC6,185,"The WCPFC Chair expressed his appreciation to outgoing TCC Chair, Ambassador Wendell Sanford, for his valuable contributions to the WPCFC. He noted with gratitude Canada‘s agreement to allow Ambassador Sanford to complete his term as TCC Chair after taking up his appointment in Brunei late last year.   AGENDA  ITEM  8  -  RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE PROTECTION , ACCESS TO, AND DISSEMINATION OF DATA COMPILED BY THE COMMISSION"
WCPFC6,186,"The Chair of the AHTG–Data, Holly Koehler (USA) presented a report on the work of the task group since WCPFC5 (WCPFC6-2009/15 [Rev. 1]). After several further iterations, a set of data rules and procedures were brought to TCC5 for discussion and were agreed on. In addition, the task group examined an issue arising from the Commission‘s 2007 Rules and Procedures, involving data associated with strata of time and area involving three vessels or less. The task group prepared a recommendation that was agreed on by TCC5. Having accomplished these tasks, the AHTG–Data Chair requested guidance on the need for continued work of the task group."
WCPFC6,187,"WCPFC6 adopted the Rules and Procedures for the Protection, Access to, and Dissemination of High Seas Non-Public Domain Data and Information Compiled by the Commission for the Purpose of Monitoring, Control of Surveillance (MCS) Activities and the Access to and Dissemination of High Seas VMS Data for Scientific Purposes (WCPFC6-2009/15 (rev. 1), Attachment B) and appended hereto at Attachment V."
WCPFC6,188,"WCPFC6 agreed, as advised by the AHTG–Data and recommended by TCC5, that the Commission amend its Procedures and Standards for Scientific Data to be Provided to the Commission to include in Section 4 (Catch and effort data aggregated by time period and geographic area) the following new paragraph: ―CCMs are to provide, to the extent possible, the number of individual vessels per stratum and area covered by their operational data with the aggregated catch and effort data they submit to the Commission‖."
WCPFC6,189,"RMI, on behalf of FFA members, suggested that the work of the AHTG–Data should continue on an ad hoc basis. Several issues potentially requiring the attention of the AHTG were identified, including provision of monitoring, control and surveillance data by chartered vessels; procedures for routine dissemination of the Commission‘s data; and ongoing advice and recommendations on data rules and procedures. The first of these issues was suggested as a priority for 2010 at TCC6."
WCPFC6,190,WCPFC6 agreed that the work of the AHTG–Data should continue on an ad hoc basis with an initial focus at TCC6 on considering the issue of data provision by chartered vessels.
WCPFC6,191,"The Chair thanked the Chair of the AHTG–Data, Ms Holly Koehler (USA) for the pioneering work of the AHTG–Data, and for her dedicated efforts toward realizing these achievements.   AGENDA  ITEM  9  -  CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES 9.1 Review of existing conservation and management measures a. CMM 2004-01 and carriers and bunkers flagged to non-CCMs 26"
WCPFC6,192,"RMI and Nauru introduced WCPFC6-2009/DP04, regarding a proposed amendment to CMM 2004-01 on the treatment of carriers and bunkers flagged to non-CCMs. The key outstanding issue concerned the existence of an Interim Register during a transition from the current system to one in which all carriers and bunkers would need to be flagged to a CCM (including CNMs) before being placed on the WCPFC RFV."
WCPFC6,193,"This amendment was supported by FFA members who stated that a strong impetus would be needed to encourage non-CCMs to become CNMs, and that alternative means for encouraging this, as proposed by other CCMs, would not be sufficient."
WCPFC6,194,"Some CCMs noted a potential connection between non-CCM flagged carriers and bunkers and IUU fishing activities, and thus supported a prompt solution to the existing situation of the WCPFC Temporary Register of Carriers and Bunkers."
WCPFC6,195,"Some CCMs requested flexibility for extraordinary circumstances that might arise when, for example, catches are very large and additional carrier vessels are required for short-term duty."
WCPFC6,196,"A concern was also raised that the amendment should also clarify situations arising from chartering, particularly in terms of whether the flag State or the chartering State takes the lead on registration and reporting."
WCPFC6,197,"After further discussion during WCPFC6, RMI and Nauru presented a revised version of the measure (WCPFC6-2009/DP04 [Rev. 2])."
WCPFC6,198,"The Executive Director requested guidance on the amount of the nominal registration fee, and it was noted that the FFA fee for inclusion of a vessel on the FFA Register is US$ 2,500 per vessel."
WCPFC6,199,"China explained that it, and perhaps other CCMs, may require flexibility in the application of the requirement under para. 23 to revoke the vessel‘s authorization to fish because it does not currently have the capability under national law to do so."
WCPFC6,200,"WCPFC6 adopted the amendment to CMM 2004-01 regarding carriers and bunkers as contained in WCPFC6-2009/DP04 (Rev. 2) (appended as Attachment W) with the amount of the nominal registration fee (para. 31) of US$ 2,500."
WCPFC6,201,"Recognizing that a number of other CMMs refer to CMM 2004-01, New Zealand suggested that work be initiated prior to TCC6 to prepare amendments necessary to reflect the changes."
WCPFC6,202,"Niue, on behalf of FFA members, proposed an additional amendment to CMM 2004-01 clarifying that flag States are responsible for ensuring that their vessels are on the RFV before commencing fishing operations in the area (WCPFC6-2009/DP10)."
WCPFC6,203,"Some CCMs expressed concerns about administrative issues that have hindered prompt placement of vessels on the RFV, but stated that improvement in procedures is expected, and thus the amendment could be supported."
WCPFC6,204,Two CCMs pointed out that the identification of minimum standard data fields for the RFV (i.e. those would need to be provided to the Secretariat before the vessel could be placed on the RFV) was an important outstanding issue. One of these CCMs considered that it was impractical 27  for the Secretariat to require data for all of the RFV data fields for the initial placement on the RFV.
WCPFC6,205,WCPFC6 approved the amendment to CMM 2004-01 contained in WCPFC6-2009/DP10 clarifying that flag States are responsible for ensuring that their vessels are on the RFV prior to commencing operations in the WCPFC Convention Area.   b. CMM 2005-03 North Pacific albacore
WCPFC6,206,"The NC Chair presented a proposal to revise CMM 2005-03 on North Pacific albacore (WCPFC-2009/DP06). The NC Chair acknowledged the concerns of FFA members regarding the authority of the NC for the Convention Area north of 20o north latitude only, but highlighted the importance of a CMM that covered the entire distribution of the stock, which in the case of North Pacific albacore extends to the equator. It was noted that IATTC has in place a similar measure that covers all of its Convention Area north of the equator. The NC Chair proposed that the Commission adopt the proposed CMM under its mandate to manage stocks in the Convention Area over their entire range."
WCPFC6,207,"FFA members stated they could not support the measure because it exceeded the area of competence of the NC, and consultation within the Commission had been insufficient to generate the required understanding of the proposal among non-NC members."
WCPFC6,208,"Several CCMs, while noting that the proposal covered an area for which the Commission, rather than the NC, was responsible (i.e. 0–20o N), stated that they would be comfortable with a Commission decision to support the proposed CMM because it is important to cover the entire range of the stock."
WCPFC6,209,"After subsequent discussion in the margins of WPCFC6, there appeared to be consensus support for the application of the measure north of 20o degrees north latitude, but not in waters between the equator and 20o N."
WCPFC6,210,WCPFC6 agreed to postpone further consideration of the measure until next year.   c.  CMM 2005-03 IUU listing procedures
WCPFC6,211,"Tonga, on behalf of FFA members, presented WCPFC6-2009/DP11, which contained a proposal to amend CMM 2007-03, para. 15. The intent of the amendment is to require that sanctions for IUU fishing violations that occur in national waters be resolved to the satisfaction of the coastal State in whose waters they occurred. The amendment thus makes separate provisions for violations that occur in national waters and those that occur on the high seas."
WCPFC6,212,"Some CCMs did not support the amendment because, according to their interpretation, international law requires that sanctions be imposed by the flag State. These CCMs considered that the cooperation of the flag State is an important element of deterring IUU fishing."
WCPFC6,213,"Some of these CCMs noted that flag State penalties will vary according to their national legal systems, and this context needed to be appreciated when considering whether the penalty was of adequate severity."
WCPFC6,214,One CCM suggested that the proposed amendment to CMM 2007-03 be modified to include the requirement that penalties imposed by the coastal State not be discriminatory.    28
WCPFC6,215,"FFA members and some other CCMs voiced their strong support for the amendment.  These CCMs pointed out that the current WCPFC IUU vessel listing procedures do not assist coastal States in bringing IUU vessels to justice under their own legal systems, and thus do not assist coastal States in obtaining compensation for damages incurred."
WCPFC6,216,"Because agreement could not be reached, further discussion was deferred until TCC6."
WCPFC6,217,New Zealand again noted its interest in proposing a number of revisions to CMM 2007-03 for discussion at TCC6 (see Agenda Item 7d).   d. CMM 2007-04 Seabirds
WCPFC6,218,"The Executive Director introduced WCPFC6-2009/IP05, which contains a comparison of Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) seabird mitigation measures and those contained in CMM 2007-04. It was noted that CMM 2007-04 requires annual consideration of revisions to the specified mitigation measures but that neither SC5 nor TCC5 produced recommendations on amendment of seabird mitigation measures for the Commission this year."
WCPFC6,219,"Several CCMs welcomed the comparison with IOTC‘s new measures for further consider at SC6 and TCC6, and suggested that the Kobe2 workshop on bycatch issues to be held in the USA in 2010 will also inform this process."
WCPFC6,220,Australia indicated that it had a range of comments on the paper that it would pass on directly to the Secretariat.  One of these comments suggests incorporating a diagram similar to IOTC‘s into CMM 2007-04.
WCPFC6,221,WCPFC6 agreed to task TCC6 with considering updates to CMM 2007-04 and making a recommendation to WCPFC7 in this regard.   e.  CMM 2008-01 Yellowfin and bigeye  Evaluating the effectiveness of CMM 2008-01 and additional proposals to close high seas areas
WCPFC6,222,"John Hampton (SPC-OFP) presented two papers (WCPFC6-2009-IP17 and 18) that relate to CMM 2008-01, and an assessment of the potential effectiveness of this measure. A large part of this work involved determining the limits that apply to various fisheries under the measure. The projections showed that CMM 2008-01 is highly unlikely to meet its objectives of a 30% reduction in bigeye fishing mortality from 2001–2004 levels, and maintenance of the bigeye stock at a level capable of producing MSY over the long term. The measures are predicted to result in little if any reduction in bigeye F/FMSY from the high levels in excess of 2.0 estimated for 2007–2008, and accordingly, biomass is predicted to fall to around 0.4–0.6 of biomass at MSY. The main reasons for the lack of effectiveness of the measure are the:   a. reductions in longline catch do not result in the required reduction in fishing mortality on adult bigeye;  b. increase in purse-seine effort allowed under the measure, and the increase in purse-seine catchability (fishing mortality per unit of effort) that has occurred since 2001–2004, is not sufficiently offset by the FAD and high seas pocket closures to reduce purse-seine fishing mortality below 2001–2004 average levels; and c. exclusion of archipelagic waters, which encompass most of the fishing activity of the Indonesian and Philippines domestic fleets and significant amounts of purse-seine effort in Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands.   29"
WCPFC6,223,"Additional requests were made at SC5 for further analyses, particularly in relation to the various exemptions and special provisions of CMM 2008-01, but due to limited resources it was not possible to complete this work in its entirety. Analyses showed that removal of all exemptions and special provisions should result in a more effective management measure with respect to reductions in fishing mortality, but that alone was insufficient to meet the objective of CMM 2008-01."
WCPFC6,224,"Some CCMs expressed disappointment that the scenarios modeled in the papers did not follow the requests of SC5 and that some of them are closely connected with possible allocation of fishing opportunities, which is beyond the mandate of SC and SPC, and is a matter for the Commission. They also expressed concern that the baseline in the scenarios was changed from 2001–2004 to 2007, which was inconsistent with the request by SC5 (WCPFC6-2009/IP22)."
WCPFC6,225,"Dr Hampton responded that some scenarios were composites of individual exemptions because there was not sufficient staff time available to model all individual exemptions separately. Regarding the change in the baseline, Dr Hampton explained that although CMM 2008-01 refers to a baseline of 2001–2004, management scenarios need to be framed in terms of reducing fishing effort from current levels. This is because effort has continued to increase since the baseline."
WCPFC6,226,"Some CCMs expressed surprise at the model results, which showed that a) closure of the two high seas pockets in 2010 would have almost no effect on the stock; and b) the bigeye stock is depleted to the extent that the allowable catch of bigeye by longliners is unlikely to be attained regardless of how much effort is expended. Given the lack of effectiveness of the closure, these CCMs questioned the fairness of imposing the provisions of CMM 2008-01."
WCPFC6,227,Some CCMs attributed the likely failure of CMM 2008-01 to meet its objectives to the number of exemptions that were granted to various CCMs‘ fisheries. Some of these CCMs called for all provisions of CMM 2008-01 to be applied consistently and fairly throughout the Convention Area.
WCPFC6,228,"In responding to these points, Dr Hampton clarified that the effect of the 2010 pocket closure depends on whether the fishing effort that would have been expended there is cancelled or simply moved to another area. He also noted that if all exemptions to the measure were removed this would reduce the amount of overfishing by 55% (i.e. F/FMSY would fall from 2.09 to 1.49)."
WCPFC6,229,Several CCMs expressed support for a seasonal closure of appropriate duration of the entire purse-seine fishery in the WCPO rather than just a seasonal closure for purse-seine fishing on FADs. One CCM added that the purse-seine fishery could be made subject to a time/area closure when and where juvenile tuna catch rates are particularly high. One CCM also proposed identification and protection of tuna spawning and nursery areas.
WCPFC6,230,"Dr Hampton responded that since tropical tuna spawning grounds vary with water temperature over a very wide area, identifying discrete nursery and spawning areas would be difficult."
WCPFC6,231,One CCM suggested that the impacts of CMM 2008-01 on skipjack fisheries should be considered.    30
WCPFC6,232,Dr Hampton responded that a skipjack stock assessment would be conducted in 2010.  Initial indications are that CMM 2008-01 did not have a negative effect on skipjack fisheries.
WCPFC6,233,"Most CCMs agreed that while it is not acceptable to do nothing in response to the SPC report, it was not practical to amend CMM 2008-01 at WCPFC6. These CCMs also agreed that a strong package of revised measures is clearly needed and should be progressed as soon as possible."
WCPFC6,234,"Some CCMs noted that empirical data from the two-month 2009 FAD closure was not used in the SPC analyses, but that once it becomes available it should inform both SPC and SC and provide a better scientific basis for the evaluation of the current measure and consideration of new provisions for a future measure."
WCPFC6,235,Dr. Hampton responded that observer data are critical to obtaining better spatial distribution data for purse-seine catches; port sampling cannot achieve this objective due to the potential for transhipment to occur between the catch location and port.
WCPFC6,236,Two CCMs requested an immediate review of CMM 2008-01 and adoption of revised provisions by WCPFC6.
WCPFC6,237,WPCFC6 accepted the recommendation of WCPFC6-2009/IP18 (i.e. that CMM 2008-01 will not achieve its stated objective of a 30% reduction in bigeye fishing mortality from 2001-2004 or 2004 levels). It was agreed to consider the issues raised in the discussion at WCPFC6 through the 2010 SC and TCC forums with a view to bringing forward a new package of measures for consideration at WCPFC7.
WCPFC6,238,"The Philippines presented a proposal limiting the intended closure of the two western high seas pockets provided for in CMM 2008-01 (WCPFC6-2009/DP13 Rev.1). The Philippines maintained that adopting the provision would place a disproportionate burden on the Philippines, thereby causing significant negative social and economic disruption, and would potentially displace the Philippine high seas fleet into areas closer to the Philippines that are recognized tuna spawning and nursery areas. These areas support high catches of juvenile yellowfin and bigeye tuna, which the Philippines has pledged to protect under the Coral Triangle Initiative. This would result in adverse impacts on the stock throughout its range."
WCPFC6,239,"Japan, on behalf of Asian fishing nations, expressed concern over the unfair nature of CMM 2008-01, and stated that they are not in a position to accept any further reduction on their side unless the unfairness is resolved (Attachment X). Japan also called on the USA to increase its efforts to mitigate the catch of small bigeye by their fleets."
WCPFC6,240,"The USA replied that it was making its best efforts to do so, noting that the solution to mitigating juvenile bigeye mortality was likely to be found in cooperation with industry. The USA also stated that the reported high proportion of bigeye in the catch of purse seiners operating in the central Pacific region may be a reflection on a history of robust catch sampling of vessels operating in that area, and that with improved sampling of vessels in the western tropical Pacific, it is possible that increased proportions of bigeye in the catch of purse seiners in that region will be reported."
WCPFC6,241,"A proposal was made by Cooks Islands, and supported by several CCMs, including FFA members, to close two additional high seas pockets (located between Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu; and the Cook Islands, French Polynesia and Kiribati) to purse-seine fishing. Cook 31  Islands noted that Article 8 (4) of the Convention gives special attention to management of such pockets, and stated that its proposal was based both on biological conservation needs as well as the need to reduce safe havens for IUU fishing activities. It was also noted that the Commission is required to consider closure of these two additional high seas pockets by CMM 2008-01, para. 22."
WCPFC6,242,"Fiji requested special consideration for its domestic longline fleet, which it noted was required to operate in the high seas pocket west of Fiji in order to maintain viable operations. Fiji wanted to avoid the possibility that its longline vessels would be nominated for IUU fishing if the pocket was closed and its vessels were detected operating in it."
WCPFC6,243,"Some CCMs stated that they considered the 2010 high seas pocket closures ineffective and unfair, and therefore could not support the proposal by Cook Islands."
WCPFC6,244,Greenpeace stated that high seas pocket closures are critical to protecting areas that are highly vulnerable to IUU fishing. Greenpeace also called for a ban on FAD fishing.
WCPFC6,245,"Papua New Guinea, supported by several CCMs, including FFA members, raised concerns regarding a potential shift in effort to model region 4 — where catch per unit of effort was reported to be 40 times greater than in other areas — that may result when the two western high seas pockets are closed on 1 January 2010. These concerns echo the PNA‘s Bikenibeu Declaration, which notes the serious impact of high seas, distant-water longline and purse-seine operations on bigeye stocks. In order to avoid having the 2010 high seas pocket closures result in a greater impact on the stocks (i.e. through effort shifts), Papua New Guinea called for a closure of the high seas areas of the Convention Area east of 170° E between 10o N and 20o S to purse-seine fishing (WCPFC6-2009/DP-41)."
WCPFC6,246,"The CCMs who did not support Cook Islands‘ proposal also did not support the proposal by Papua New Guinea. In addition to their previously stated reasons, these CCMs noted the lack of a clear biological basis for the proposal."
WCPFC6,247,"Other CCMs asked for clarification on the proposal, including issues of whether there could be more specific area closures identified within the vast area proposed, and for further consideration of potential impacts to fleets operating out of American Samoa."
WCPFC6,248,"The IATTC observer noted that Papua New Guinea‘s proposal covered some areas that will also be subject to IATTC measures, and this overlap could create confusion."
WCPFC6,249,"WCPFC agreed to maintain its intention to close the two western high seas pockets to purse-seine fishing on 1 January 2010 as agreed on at WCPFC5, and deferred the Philippines’ proposal to TCC6 for further discussion. Proposals to close two additional high seas pockets, or the entire high seas portion of the Convention Area between 20o N and 20o S to purse-seine fishing were not adopted."
WCPFC6,250,"Cook Islands stated that it remained deeply concerned about the issue, and planned to bring forward a similar proposal to TCC6 for further discussion."
WCPFC6,251,Several CCMs highlighted the connection between conservation and management of bigeye and yellowfin resources and the issue of capacity. These CCMs suggested that the former cannot be achieved without due regard to addressing the latter.    32
WCPFC6,252,"Chinese Taipei stated that it is willing to assist developing countries, particularly SIDS, to develop their fisheries so that they can make use of the marine resources in their waters for the development of their economies. In this connection, Resolution 2008-01 was adopted last year urging developed CCMs to render assistance to SIDS in this respect. After the adoption of this resolution, Chinese Taipei was approached by many officials and entrepreneurs requesting the building of purse-seine vessels in its shipyards. As previously mentioned in different fora, Chinese Taipei has domestic legislation to regulate the building of fishing vessels for export and the export of second hand vessels with the objective of avoiding an increase in fishing capacity in the region. Chinese Taipei is somewhat puzzled as to whether or not such building of purse-seine vessels is consistent with Resolution 2008-01, and will not be taken as increase in fishing capacity by Chinese Taipei. Chinese Taipei asked for guidance from the Commission on which it will consider an adjustment to its policy."
WCPFC6,253,"FFA members noted that they cooperate with CCMs as a means of participating in the management of shared stocks but that they have their own tools (e.g. the Third Implementing Arrangement of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement and the Vessel Day Scheme) to manage fishing effort. FFA members stated that they approach issues related to managing capacity with caution, and reject any suggestion of further controls on vessel acquisition from distant-water fishing States."
WCPFC6,254,"Some FFA members also reminded WCPFC6 that the aspirations of SIDS need not necessarily result in catching more fish; rather, the goal would be to add value to and maximize the benefits from fish that are already being caught. The ongoing assistance of some distant-water fishing States in this regard (e.g. onshore processing) was noted. It was also emphasized that maximizing value in this way could generate additional financial resources to sustain the Commission‘s work."
WCPFC6,255,"The Chair noted that in order to support the legitimate aspirations of SIDS to develop and benefit from their resources, while at the same time conserve and manage fish stocks in an effective manner, the transfer of fishing capacity to developing countries should be accompanied by a reduction in the fishing capacity of distant-water fishing States."
WCPFC6,256,The EU requested that the record state that their understanding with regard to observers and the cross-endorsement procedures as articulated under Agenda Item 9.4c below also applies to CMM 2008-01.    High seas alternative to FAD closure
WCPFC6,257,"The Executive Director introduced WCPFC6-2009/IP12, which reports on the alternative measures taken by Japan, New Zealand and the Philippines under paras. 15 and 16 of CMM 2008-01. In July, New Zealand decided it would not pursue the alternative measures and would participate in the FAD closures. Data submitted by these three CCMs are profiled in the paper."
WCPFC6,258,"New Zealand explained that it withdrew from its intention to apply the alternative measures due to higher bigeye catches than anticipated and because of difficulties in reconciling the outcomes of port sampling with the historical estimates of bigeye catch used to set their bigeye catch limit. New Zealand reported that it is continuing with sampling work and trials of methods to reduce catches of juvenile bigeye by purse-seine vessels, and hopes to report the results to future meetings of the SC.   33"
WCPFC6,259,Japan informed WCPFC6 that it does not wish to apply the alternative measures in 2010 and will participate in the FAD closure.
WCPFC6,260,"Several CCMs raised concerns that the 2009 FAD closure had not been applied uniformly in the EEZs of some PNA members that had provided additional exemptions for at least one distant-water nation fishing partner. Some CCMs suggested that a full set of information should be available to TCC6 in 2010 to allow a full assessment of the implementation of each provision of CMM 2008-01 in 2009, and to review its application by individual fleets and coastal States."
WCPFC6,261,"RMI, on behalf of FFA members, expressed appreciation for the data generated through the application of the alternative measures, and stated that it remains open to incentive-based approaches in the future. However, it does not support application of the alternative measures for 2010 and 2011."
WCPFC6,262, WCPFC6 agreed that alternative measures for the high seas were only available in 2009 and that no alternative measures would apply in 2010.  FAD closures and catch retention
WCPFC6,263,"Kiribati, on behalf of PNA members, presented a proposal (WCPFC6-2009/DP14) that would apply PNA provisions for FAD closures and catch retention to the high seas in the area between 20o N and 20oS where FAD closures and catch retention by purse-seine vessels are called for under CMM 2008-01."
WCPFC6,264,"Some CCMs raised questions or concerns about the PNA provisions, including the definition of FADs, which covers living marine organisms and the term ―unfit for human consumption‖; and the specification of seven-day and 50-mile buffers during the FAD closure."
WCPFC6,265,One CCM suggested that rather than attempting to define ―unfit for human consumption‖ that para. 27(b) of CMM 2008-01 be deleted.
WCPFC6,266,One CCM suggested waiting until more information is available on the 2009 FAD closure from observer reports before agreeing on detailed rules.
WCPFC6,267,"PNA members noted that the proposal represents a potential extension to the high seas of rules, which are already applicable inside PNA waters and which contain the majority of tropical tuna catches. These CCMs stated that if compatibility is to be ensured, the high seas rules should conform to the PNA rules. It was also pointed out that compatibility of rules will benefit the ROP."
WCPFC6,268,"One CCM, supported by several others, stated a preference for a seasonal closure of the entire purse-seine fishery rather than just a seasonal FAD closure."
WCPFC6,269,"One CCM explained that because these PNA rules were in some cases different to the specifications in CMM 2008-01, which had formed the basis for national legislation now being implemented, it would be difficult to adopt new rules at this point."
WCPFC6,270,"After an initial discussion, most CCMs supported initial implementation of the proposal on an interim basis with a full review after one year."
WCPFC6,271,WCPFC adopted the PNA’s proposal for FAD closure and catch retention rules on the high seas as contained in WCPFC6-2009/DP14 as a CMM (CMM 2009-02 FAD Closure 34  and Catch Retention) (Attachment Y). The measure is to be reviewed by TCC6 and the results reported back to WCPFC7 for further consideration.
WCPFC6,272,"On the understanding that some CCMs’ domestic regulations are compatible with, but not identical to, the PNA rules, and that those CCMs will submit copies of these regulations to the WCPFC Secretariat prior to the 2010 FAD closure, WCPFC6 agreed to permit some flexibility in the implementation of the measure for 2010 for those CCMs.    Japan‘s port monitoring, capacity reduction and purse-seine fleet growth papers"
WCPFC6,273,"Japan presented WCPFC6-2009/IP19 on port monitoring experience in Japan, WCPFC6-2009/IP20 on the scrapping of 87 Japanese longliners, and WCPFC6-2009/IP21on growth of the WCPO purse-seine fleet by several Members."
WCPFC6,274,WCPFC6 noted the papers. The issue of Japan‘s port monitoring is further discussed under Agenda Item 9.4.    Proposal for a CMM on banning FAD sets at night during the FAD closure period
WCPFC6,275,Korea introduced a proposal to ban purse-seine sets between midnight and sunrise local time during the FAD closure. The motivation for the proposal was a finding presented at SC5 that 95% of FAD sets occurred before sunrise but only 3% of unassociated sets occurred before sunrise. Korea stated that banning purse-seine sets at night during the FAD closure would strengthen implementation of the closure.
WCPFC6,276,"Three CCMs commented that because FAD sets are already banned during the FAD closure period, the imposition of a ban on FAD sets is duplicative and unnecessary. One of these CCMs suggested that the definition of ―sunrise local time‖ could be problematic."
WCPFC6,277,Two CCMs stated that the proposal was appealing and worthy of further consideration.
WCPFC6,278,Korea agreed to elaborate the proposal for further discussion at SC6.   f. CMM 2008-03 Sea Turtles
WCPFC6,279,"Australia requested WCPFC6‘s approval of its sea turtle mitigation plan (WCPFC6-2009/IP16) as required under CMM 2008-03, noting that both SC and TCC had recommended Commission approval of the plan."
WCPFC6,280,WCPFC6 approved Australia’s sea turtle mitigation plan (WCPFC6-2009/IP16).   g. CMM 2008-05 Swordfish
WCPFC6,281,"Australia, on behalf of FFA members, presented WCPFC6-2009/DP09 (Rev. 1) containing a proposal to amend CMM 2008-05 concerning swordfish. The proposal is in response to a requirement under CMM 2008-05 that the Commission review the measure at WCPFC6."
WCPFC6,282,"The EU reported that it had provided a report on an audit of its swordfish data to the Executive Director, and that SPC has taken account of the information. Other information has also been provided, including bilaterally. The EU thus considers that all outstanding issues from WCPFC5 have been settled.   35"
WCPFC6,283,Chinese Taipei requested that the data on vessels smaller than 100 GRT in Annex 1 of the proposed CMM be adjusted to reflect a new figure provided by Chinese Taipei of a total of 84 vessels in 2003.
WCPFC6,284,Two CCMs requested that the date of review of the measure be moved forward from 2012 to 2011.
WCPFC6,285,"With incorporation of the above two changes, WCPFC6 adopted WCPFC6-2009/DP09 (Rev. 1) as a new CMM for swordfish (CMM 2009-03 Swordfish) (Attachment Z).   h. CMM 2008-06 Sharks"
WCPFC6,286,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC6-2009/IP14, which on the basis of recommendations from SC5 and NC5, incorporates silky shark in the list of key shark species in CMM 2008-06."
WCPFC6,287,Australia suggested that WCPFC6 task SC6 with the following: a. Consider adding porbeagle to the list of key shark species on the basis that it is a CMS Appendix II species;  b. Consider information contained in the Pacific Islands Regional Plan of Action for Sharks (WCPFC6-2009/IP13); c. Review the list of shark species identified for stock assessment and for annual reporting by CCMs to ensure it includes species at highest risk; and  d. requested that WCPFC7 review the shark measure taking into account the Kobe2 bycatch workshop to be held in 2010.
WCPFC6,288,Japan suggested that hammerheads and porbeagle also be reviewed by SC6 for possible inclusion in the list of key shark species.
WCPFC6,289,Palau informed WCPFC6 that it has established the world‘s first nationwide shark sanctuary and encouraged other CCMs to join in efforts to assess and manage shark species and work toward their conservation (Attachment AA).
WCPFC6,290,WCPFC6 adopted a revised CMM to include the silky shark as a key shark species in CMM 2008-06 (CMM 2009-04) (Attachment BB) and the suggestions by Australia and Japan to task SC6 and WCPFC7 with the above items concerning shark stocks.   9.2 Report by PNA members on the implementation of the vessel day scheme
WCPFC6,291,"Kiribati, on behalf of PNA members, presented a report on the vessel day scheme (VDS), which has now been in operation for just over two years (WCPFC6-2009/DP21). For the first Management Year (1 December 2007 to 30 November 2008) 31,431 days were used and for the second Management Year (partial period:  1 January to 31 October 2009, 11 months) 30,029 days were used."
WCPFC6,292,One CCM asked for more detail on the operation of the scheme to be provided in future reports.
WCPFC6,293,"Kiribati, on behalf of PNA, noted the request.   36  9.3 Response to the Commission’s request in respect of a high seas VDS"
WCPFC6,294,"The Secretariat prepared WCPFC6-2009/17 in response to the requirement of CMM 2008-01, para. 21 for the Commission to consider development of a VDS for the high seas, which would be compatible with the PNA VDS. Efforts by the Philippines to provide catch and effort data for the high seas were acknowledged. Because no substantive comments on the issue were provided by SC5 or TCC5, the Commission was invited to consider recommendations for any further work necessary for a high seas VDS in 2010."
WCPFC6,295,"WCPFC6 noted WPCFC6-2009/17, which was on the development of a high seas VDS.   9.4 Consideration of new measures and other conservation requirements a. Data buoys"
WCPFC6,296,"The USA introduced WPCFC6-2009/DP01 concerning a new CMM on data buoys. This CMM was discussed at TCC5, which recommended forwarding it to WCPFC6. The USA noted a recent United Nations General Assembly resolution to protect ocean data buoys, and the fact that half of all buoy arrays are out of service due to damage."
WCPFC6,297,Several CCMs expressed concerns regarding how fishermen can be made aware of the location of data buoys and how they can distinguish between data buoys and other floating objects. These CCMs requested that the Secretariat provide links to further information about data buoys on the WCPFC website.
WCPFC6,298,"Some CCM suggested that standard marking be required for data buoys, particularly non-governmental data buoys, but this was noted to be beyond the control of the Commission."
WCPFC6,299,Some CCMs suggested that the buffer area around the buoys be reduced from 1 nm to 500 nm on the basis that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) requires a 500 nm buffer around research facilities.
WCPFC6,300,"Other CCMs noted that data buoys are being used as FADs, therefore it is appropriate that a similar distance be maintained from data buoys as from any other object being used as a FAD (i.e. 1 nm)."
WCPFC6,301,"While supporting the measure, Australia noted it may need more time to implement it than current Commission timeframes allow but would do so as expeditiously as possible."
WCPFC6,302,"WPCFC6 adopted WCPFC6-2009/DP01, as revised, as a new CMM (2009-05) entitled ―Prohibition of Fishing Activities on Data Buoys‖ (Attachment CC).   b. Transhipment"
WCPFC6,303,RMI and Nauru presented WCPFC6-2009/DP03 containing a proposal for a CMM on transhipment. This proposal represents the outcome of extensive negotiations over several years but still contains a few outstanding issues for further discussion at WCPFC6.
WCPFC6,304,"Some CCMs advocated limiting the application of the measure to the Convention Area, suggesting that cross-endorsement of observers between IATTC and WCPFC would handle cases in which vessels cross from one Convention Area to the other in the eastern Pacific.   37"
WCPFC6,305,Some CCMs noted their general opposition to allowing transhipment on the high seas but stated their willingness to support the measure as a first step.
WCPFC6,306,Some CCMs expressed concern about special provisions for particular types of fisheries as provided for in the draft measure.
WCPFC6,307,"After further discussion in the margins of WCPFC6, Nauru and RMI produced WCPFC6-2009/DP03 (Rev. 2)."
WCPFC6,308,"Discussions continued regarding the provisions of the proposed text in WCPFC6-2009/DP03 (Rev. 2) resulting in the following revisions:    a. Although the implementation date for the new provisions is 1 July 2010 (para. 1), the effective date for para. 13(c) is 1 January 2011.   b. In para. 38, ―Members of the Commission‖ should be changed to ―Members of the Commission and participating territories‖.   c. Correction of minor cross-referencing errors in the text is necessary and will be done by the Secretariat."
WCPFC6,309,"On the understanding that the above points a, e, and f will be reflected in the measure, WCPFC6 adopted the text in WCPFC-2009/DP03 (Rev. 2) as a new conservation and management measure (CMM 2009-06 Regulation on Transhipment) (Attachment DD)."
WCPFC6,310,"WCPFC6 was also noted that:  a. the conclusion of data exchange and observer cross-endorsement procedures with IATTC is considered critical for smooth and effective implementation of this measure;   b. as required under PNA arrangements, all vessels in PNA waters are required to carry PNA observers, and PNA observers can serve on the high seas if they have been authorized under the Regional Observer Programme; and   c. the provisions in para. 13 apply throughout the Convention Area."
WCPFC6,311," The EU stated its understanding that, as agreed at WCPFC5, until provisions for cross-endorsement of observers are agreed between WCPFC and IATTC, vessels crossing from the IATTC Convention Area into the WCPFC Convention Area will take a WCPFC observer at the first entry into port within the WCPFC Convention Area."
WCPFC6,312,"Vanuatu stated that it supports the proposal but has some reservations concerning the effect of the proposal on Vanuatu‘s existing transhipment operations in the high seas pocket between Vanuatu, Fiji and Solomon Islands. Vanuatu stated that given the importance of transhipment in this high seas pocket to its industry, it wished to reserve the right to object to renewal of this measure when it is next considered by the Commission."
WCPFC6,313,China agreed to work with the Secretariat on proposals for cost recovery from other RFMOs who use WCPFC observers and to ensure that all appropriate procedures are in place for the smooth implementation of the measure in 2011.
WCPFC6,314,"WCPFC6 approved a proposal by the USA for an addendum to the monitoring, control and surveillance data provision rules regarding the treatment of transhipment data (WCPFC6-2009/DP34) (see Attachment EE).   38  c. Port monitoring"
WCPFC6,315,"In accordance with para. 43 of CMM 2008-01, Japan presented WCPFC6-2009/DP05 (Rev. 2) describing port sampling and monitoring of purse-seine catches to determine species composition. The findings of the studies indicated that even for those vessels with observers, only 77% of the purse-seine bigeye tuna bycatch is reported. Based on this finding, Japan advocated greater efforts toward port sampling by CCMs, including monitoring of canneries in Bangkok, which take most of the purse-seine catches, and other high volume transhipment ports. Japan considers these types of programmes essential in documenting catches, thereby avoiding allegations that the fish are products of IUU (particularly unreported) fishing activities."
WCPFC6,316,"One CCM requested more details on Japan‘s port sampling protocols, including minimum sample sizes and sampling of split catches. This CCM requested Japan to develop a training programme for other CCMs on sampling methodologies."
WCPFC6,317,Japan agreed to host a symposium or workshop on the subject in 2010 to consider the possible establishment in 2010 of an arrangement with non-CCMs to enable the collection of species and size composition data from canneries in non-CCM ports. Progress with this work will be reported to the 2010 annual session of the Commission.
WCPFC6,318,Some CCMs supported immediate implementation of Japan‘s proposals.
WCPFC6,319,"Several CCMs, including FFA members, welcomed the information provided by the port sampling and noted that it can assist in reducing uncertainty. However, these CCMs requested more time to consider the proposals and their linkages to other instruments such as port State measures, transhipment, catch documentation schemes and the EU IUU regulation; and to consult with Thailand."
WCPFC6,320,"The USA noted that its decades-long port sampling programme for both purse seiners and longliners in American Samoa might serve as a good model in that it contains elements such as stratified sampling, accounting for at-sea sample sorting bias, and at-sea spill sampling. The USA recommended that this programme, along with others, be reviewed by SC and TCC before adopting a WCPFC port sampling programme."
WCPFC6,321,"As a compromise, Japan asked for endorsement to proceed with a cannery sampling programme in Thailand."
WCPFC6,322,"WCPFC6 adopted an abbreviated form of the proposal calling for a cannery sampling programme to be initiated (WCPFC6-2009/DP05 (Rev. 3), CMM 2009-10) (Attachment FF). WCPFC6 recognized the importance of port sampling for species composition and called for the issue to be further progressed through the SC and TCC.   d. North Pacific albacore"
WCPFC6,323,Further consideration of this measure was deferred until 2010 (see para. 211). e. Pacific bluefin tuna
WCPFC6,324,"The Chair of the NC presented a draft CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna (WCPFC6-2009/DP07) (see Agenda Item 5.1). The measure provides for holding fishing effort to levels no greater than the 2002–2004 levels for 2010, with the Korean EEZ being exempt from this measure.   39"
WCPFC6,325,"While welcoming a CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna, some CCMs expressed concerns about the exemption of the Korean EEZ from the measure and urged the NC to work toward applying the measure throughout the entire area north of 20oN from 2011 onward."
WCPFC6,326,One CCM questioned the definition of ―artisanal fisheries‖ and ―2002–2004‖ level.
WCPFC6,327,"Tokelau, on behalf of FFA members, requested that the NC continue to monitor fishing mortality on age 1–3 fish as this is of particular concern."
WCPFC6,328,WCPFC6 adopted WCPFC6-2009/DP07 as a new CMM for Pacific bluefin tuna for 2010 (CMM 2009-7) with the request of CCMs that the measure also apply to the Korean EEZ after 1January 2011 (Attachment GG).   f. North Pacific striped marlin
WCPFC6,329,"Efforts in the margins of WCPFC6, led by the USA, progressed a draft CMM for striped marlin in the North Pacific through four versions but did not reach agreement (WCPFC6-2009/24 [Rev. 4])."
WCPFC6,330,WCPFC6 agreed that further work to develop a CMM for North Pacific striped marlin should be discussed at WCPFC7.   g. Chartering notification scheme
WCPFC6,331,"Fiji, on behalf of FFA members, presented a draft CMM on chartering notification arrangements (WCPFC6-2009/DP08). This draft had been discussed at TCC5 and was subsequently subject to some minor amendments.  FFA members supported the current draft text."
WCPFC6,332,Several CCMs called for a requirement within the draft measure for notification of the flag State when charter arrangements are entered into.
WCPFC6,333,FFA members explained that the charter arrangements are business partnerships that cannot be regulated. Concerns were also expressed that flag State notification could be abused with the end result being that the development of SIDS is restricted.
WCPFC6,334,"Dr Tsamenyi advised  that the purpose of the charter notification scheme is not to address the process of chartering vessels, which is regulated by flag State laws and subject to commercial negotiation among the parties, but to promote transparency in the use of charters by requiring notification of specified information to the Commission."
WCPFC6,335,The USA highlighted catch attribution under charter arrangements and flag States/chartering member responsibilities over the chartered vessels and offered to produce a paper on this topic for consideration at TCC6.
WCPFC6,336,"Through further discussion in the margins of WCPFC6 and across the floor, CCMs agreed to modify the draft text to include a requirement for the Executive Director to immediately notify the flag State once the charter notification is received. An expiry date of 31 December 2011, with an option to renew, was also inserted to the text."
WCPFC6,337,WCPFC6 adopted the new CMM on charter arrangements (CMM 2009-008 Charter Notification Scheme) (Attachment HH) 40
WCPFC6,338,"Fiji, on behalf of FFA members, stated that nothing in the measure should be considered to provide any basis for flag States to interfere in charter arrangements between SIDS and their vessels.   h. Stateless vessels"
WCPFC6,339,"The USA presented WCPFC6-2009/DP15 (Rev. 1) containing a proposal for a new CMM on Stateless vessels, which had been discussed at TCC5 and forwarded to WCPFC6 for consideration. The USA explained that para. 5 had been deleted in the revision because the high seas boarding and inspection measure, and provisions it contained, were already authorized under UNCLOS."
WCPFC6,340,"WCPFC adopted the Stateless vessels proposal (WCPFC6-2009/DP15 [Rev. 1]) as a new CMM (CMM 2009-09, Vessels without nationality) (Attachment II)."
WCPFC6,341,"On the adoption of this CMM, Chinese Taipei stated its understanding of the CMM as follows: a. “A vessel not flying the flag of their flag State” should be defined as those vessels that refuse to show their flag; and b. Vessels not registered on the shipping registry of a State should be regarded as vessels without nationality unless the circumstances as envisaged in Article 6(2) the 1958 High Seas Convention or Article 92(2) of the 1982 UNCLOS are fulfilled.  i. Control of nationals"
WCPFC6,342,"New Zealand submitted WCPFC6-2009/DP16 to provide an update on the process of developing a CMM on the control of nationals. Comments on a draft CMM prepared by New Zealand were received from Japan, Chinese Taipei and the PNA."
WCPFC6,343,"Tuvalu, on behalf of FFA members, expressed concern that the measure not be used to prevent development of SIDS‘ domestic fisheries."
WCPFC6,344,"Given that the issues raised in these comments were substantive, New Zealand offered to work with CCMs in the coming months to prepare a revised draft CMM for consideration at TCC6. j. Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures Working Group"
WCPFC6,345,"Australia presented (WCPFC6-2009/DP17), which contains draft terms of reference for the Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures (CCMM) Working Group. It is proposed that the working group develop compliance monitoring structures and processes for consideration by the Commission, and represent the results of three previous submissions to the Commission."
WCPFC6,346,"Several CCMs spoke in support of efforts to form a CCMM Working Group, but none of them favored an intersessional meeting. Some of these CCMs suggested a special session be held during TCC6 to advance discussions on this topic, whereas others supported electronic intersessional discussions prior to TCC6."
WCPFC6,347,One CCM recommended deletion of the last portion of para. 4 of the Terms of Reference regarding a non-compliant party blocking punitive action.   41
WCPFC6,348,Some CCMs stated that they support the CCMM Working Group only as subsidiary body to the TCC.
WCPFC6,349,WCPFC approved Australia’s proposal to convene discussions on the formation of a CCMM Working Group in accordance with the terms of reference in WCPFC6-2009/DP17.   k. Port State measures
WCPFC6,350,The EU presented WCPFC6-2009/DP19 on implementing the minimum technical standards of the new FAO Port State Measures Agreement within the WCPFC.
WCPFC6,351,"Fiji, on behalf of FFA members, expressed support for the FAO Port State Measures Agreement but noted that FFA standards are stricter than those in the agreement and will be applied if appropriate. FFA members are concerned that there is no transfer of the burden of combating IUU fishing to SIDS."
WCPFC6,352,"WCPFC6 noted that implementing the provisions of the Port State Measures Agreement is a priority for the Commission, and decided that the matter be progressed through electronic means for further discussion at TCC6."
WCPFC6,353,Parties were invited to submit a first round of comments on the EU proposal to the Secretariat by 1 March 2010. The EU will soon thereafter circulate a revised proposal on which Parties will be invited to comment before 1 June 2010. The EU will thereafter further revise the proposal and present it to TCC6. l. Draft CMM on aspirations for developing states
WCPFC6,354,A draft CMM on aspirations for developing States (WCPFC6-2009/DP24) tabled by RMI was withdrawn.  m. Kobe matrix
WCPFC6,355,"Canada introduced WCPFC6-2009/DP31, presenting a strategy matrix that can serve as a harmonized format for standardizing scientific advice, and a first step toward depicting stock status against reference points to clearly communicate risk. It was noted that the concept was presented at and endorsed by the Kobe2 meeting. The paper contains a proposal for a pilot project applying the matrix within the WCPFC as workloads allow (i.e. probably in 2011)."
WCPFC6,356,WCPFC6 tasked the management objectives workshop with determining the elements of the matrix with subsequent forwarding of the material to SC7 (2011) for further consideration.   n. NGO information for compliance
WCPFC6,357,"Canada presented WCPFC6-2009/DP33, concerning procedures for the submission and actioning of reports from non-governmental organizations on non-compliance with the Commission‘s CMMs."
WCPFC6,358,"Due to time constraints, WCPFC6 was unable to discuss this issue and it was referred to TCC6 for further consideration.   42  AGENDA  ITEM  10  -  ANNUAL REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION"
WCPFC6,359,"The Executive Director presented WCPFC6-2009/19, which presents a profile of the Commission‘s work during 2009. The report summarizes the work of the WCPFC subsidiary bodies, the Secretariat, contracts and consultancies, relations with other organizations and emerging issues. An annex details the progress in implementing the functions of the Commission as assessed by the Secretariat."
WCPFC6,360,WCPFC7 took note of the report and the WCPFC Chair expressed his particular appreciation for the dedication of the Secretariat staff.   AGENDA  ITEM  11  -  REPORT OF THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE
WCPFC6,361,"The Chair of the Finance and Administration Committee (FAC), Ambassador Terry Toomata (Samoa), presented the report of FAC3 (WCPFC6-2009/27) (Attachment JJ).  Highlights of the report included a likely cash flow problem for the Commission resulting from extra-budgetary VMS expenses; preparation of a draft Strategic Plan; appointment of a new Executive Director; new rules for contributions from those CCMs fishing in the area of overlap between the WCPFC and IATTC Convention areas; and the proposed budget for 2010 and indicative budgets for 2011 and 2012. The FAC Chair noted that the proposed 2010 budget has been reduced through cost cutting to US$ 5.4 million, and thanked New Caledonia for its generous, voluntary contribution of €115,000 to the Regional Observer Programme (ROP) Support Fund, and offer to explore means to provide ongoing support (WCPFC6-2009/DP39).  Nevertheless, undesirable budget cuts still needed to be made and it was recommended that a cost recovery study be undertaken to identify means of gathering additional funds for the work of the Commission, for example, through cost recovery for air time costs associated with the Commission VMS, financial contributions from CNMs and/or a registration charge for observer delegations."
WCPFC6,362,New Caledonia sought explicit confirmation of the decision to implement Option 5.1 for ROP data management (WPCFC6-2009/IP-08; also see Agenda Item 7).
WCPFC6,363,"Several CCMs, noting a previously stated and clear preference for Option 5.3 in relation to ROP data management (see Agenda Item 7), agreed to accept Option 5.1 for an initial one-year period."
WCPFC6,364,"Several CCMs stated that, given the limited time available for review, it would be inappropriate to include the Strategic Plan as part of the endorsement of the report of FAC3."
WCPFC6,365,Two CCMs suggested that if any surplus funding becomes available that the ROP should be allocated the additional funds as observer data is critical to robust scientific and management advice.
WCPFC6,366,Two CCMs and the WCPFC Chair suggested that surplus funding should be allocated to rapporteuring services because it is an important element of meeting support that cannot be provided by Secretariat staff without compromising other Secretariat services to the meeting.
WCPFC6,367,"The Executive Director clarified that security concerns have recently been heightened at Pohnpei, thus requiring some security expenditures by the Commission. He explained that a Commission contribution to some projects has been necessary to leverage large amounts of donor 43  funds; these funds can be shown in future budget spreadsheets as income from other sources. In response to concerns raised regarding the extra-budgetary VMS costs, the Executive Director noted that the additional cost was incurred because nearly double the forecast number of vessels had reported to the Commission‘s VMS in 2009. He also indicated that it was estimated that approximately 127 carriers and bunkers would be listed on the WCPFC RFV and charges accrued from those listings would be set aside in a special fund awaiting an allocation decision by the Commission at WCPFC7."

CCMs were encouraged to consider secondments to fill this interim need."
WCPFC6,370,"FFA members announced that a workshop hosted by FFA on fisheries management arising from the Kobe2 joint tuna RFMO meeting, will be held from 29 June to 1 July 2010 in Brisbane, Australia. It was suggested that a special WCPFC meeting be held on Friday, 2 July 2010 to discuss applications for the Executive Director position.   AGENDA  ITEM  12  -  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEVELOPING STATES"
WCPFC6,371,"Tuvalu, on behalf of FFA members, made a statement reminding CCMs of the provisions of Resolution 2008-01, regarding cooperation of developed CCMs with SIDS and territories to increase the share of benefits from the fish stocks of the Convention Area received by SIDS and territories. Developed CCMs were encouraged to fully implement Resolution 2008-01 in accordance with Article 30 of the Convention and as called for by agreed immediate action (j) at the Kobe2 meeting."
WCPFC6,372,"RMI, also on behalf of FFA members, noted with regret that SIDS-supported proposals on revising the IUU listing/de-listing procedures and on development aspirations had not been supported by some CCMs. These and other experiences were causing concern among SIDS that constraints to their development were ongoing and increasing. While acknowledging with sincere appreciation the receipt of financial and in-kind contributions, RMI, on behalf of FFA members, urged developed CCMs to take the opportunity to inform the Commission of their implementation of Article 30 of the Convention."
WCPFC6,373,"Kiribati, supporting the statements of Tuvalu and RMI, noted that during WCPFC5 it had taken difficult decisions to continue to support arrangements that it considered impinged on their sovereign rights with regard to licensing. Kiribati expressed great concern regarding an incident in which one of its joint ventures has been blocked by the actions of another CCM, and stated that such situations were unacceptable impediments to SIDS‘ development aspirations."

WCPFC6,378,"The USA highlighted its shiprider agreements with six SIDS and territories: Cook Islands, FSM, Kiribati, RMI, Palau and Tonga, as well as their recent cooperative enforcement exercises (Operations Bigeye and Island Chief), which resulted in the detection of a number of fisheries management infractions."
WCPFC6,379,Japan restated its view that it will be necessary for developed CCMs to find a real mechanism for transferring capacity to developing countries and ensuring that real benefit accrues to SIDS rather than to irresponsible foreign investors.
WCPFC6,380,France noted their commitment to combating IUU fishing activities.
WCPFC6,381,"The WCPFC Chair, noting the proposal by FFA members (see Agenda 7.1 [a]), suggested that a separate item be added to the agenda of future meetings to allow developed CMMs to report to the Commission on their implementation of Article 30.

WCPFC6,395,"WCPFC6 agreed that this was essentially a bilateral issue between the CCM and the Secretariat, and that an agreement to extend the VMS to waters under national jurisdiction in this case in no way undermines the exclusive control of coastal States over their national waters.   16.3 WCPFC5 Summary Report"
WCPFC6,396,"PNG expressed grave disappointment in the WCPFC Secretariat in allowing certain CCMs to manipulate the opinion of the WCPFC Legal Advisor regarding the application of the Commission‘s CMMs to archipelagic and internal waters, and changing the initial draft of the WCPFC5 Summary Report, as it was further noted that the Commission‘s area of competence is the EEZs and the high seas, not territorial seas and archipelagic waters, quoting Article 56 of UNCLOS.    47"
WCPFC6,397,"The WCPFC Chair agreed that the issue of application of CMMs to support sustainable use of the stock throughout their range remained open for discussion. The Chair also noted that the purpose of the Convention is to establish a framework for cooperation between coastal States‘ management and high seas management, and to harmonize the interests of all parties while implementing best practices."
